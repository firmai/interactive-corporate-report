91,Jim F.,"Duluth, GA",1,3,,1.0,2012-01-14,"The Duluth, Georgia TGIF has very poor service and this seems to be consistently bad. We have been there several times and every time we promise not to come back because of the poor service. The waitress forgot my meal and our drinks went unfilled as well as when we asked for something our waitress ignored us and we had to ask her numerous times for what we needed. Would not recommend this TGIF to anyone and this is a shame since other TGIF locations seem to offer great service and really cater to their customers. This obviously is a manager problem since all the times we have been there, he never seems to find the time to visit with the patrons. Poor service,lack of manager interest points to why the Duluth, GA TGIF is having problems. We will not go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=140,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

My salads have always been great and the service is is equally so. If you're wondering if this location is any better than any other TGI Fridays, I can't tell you one way or another but this location does deliver. The one complaint I do have is that they never seem to have their hostess at the front of the restaurant.  We're always waiting 30 -45 seconds too long to be seated.  Next time I'm there, I'll have to give some constructive criticism to their GM. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=100,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
69,Phong T.,"Stone Mountain, GA",463,435,1806.0,4.0,2012-06-05,"I've always been a fan of TGIF! This place makes everyday feels like a Friday when you dine-in because of the food, which is definitely better than other chains similar to theirs.  I've been to this specific location about greater than 10 times within the past 4 years and several times at the one off Barrett Parkway. Only thing different is that service here tends to vary on who you get as a waiter/waitress.  I love the 3 course meal promotion for 1 person; two set prices based on quantity. I've been here recently for lunch so I don't know if they still have that promotion (usually for dinner  I believe), but they do have a 2 course meal for $10 (either appetizer or dessert and a main entree). My friend and I did this for lunch and we both got: 2 Appetizers = pot stickers and spicy beef queso with chips 2 Entrees = parmesan crusted flounder with rice and vegetables (zucchini and cucumbers) and bruschetta chicken pasta.  The food is always tasteful and perfect. I believe you pay for what you get here quality-wise. I also love their menu and selections provided.

14,Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2415.0,3.0,2012-06-17,"After a long day of running errands with my brother, I asked him what he felt like eating for dinner.  He thought for a few minutes, we searched through the nearby restaurants on the Yelp app, and he told me he wanted to go to TGI Friday's.  Since I hadn't been there in probably at least year, I agreed that we would go there. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday evening.  Since it was still early for dinner, the restaurant wasn't too busy and there was no wait.  The hostess seated us at the right side of the restaurant by the wall. The first thing our server asked was if we were ""Give Me More Stripes"" card members.  I told her that I was.  She said that was great, and that she'd bring us complimentary ""Stripes"" chips and salsa since I had a Stripes card.  Sweet!  It had been so long since I had been to a TGI Friday's that I didn't know that they always provided free chips and salsa to Stripes members, but we happily welcomed this nice surprise.  They were decent for free chips and salsa, but they weren't anything special. My brother wanted a burger, and I wanted a pasta, but we also wanted to try each others' dishes.  So we agreed to just share both entrees!  This turned out to be perfect. We finished our first round of ""Stripes"" chips (rectangular, so literally shaped like stripes) fairly quickly, and we looked around for our server who had told us we could get unlimited refills.  She was no where in sight.  We sat and waited...  and waited...  and waited...  It felt like we were sitting and waiting for about 10 minutes with no one checking on us.  Finally, we flagged down one of the hostesses after she sat a new group at their table.  We told her that we simply wanted a refill of chips and salsa, and we asked if she could find our server.  She said she would request it for us. A few minutes later, our server brought our entrees over.  When she asked if we needed anything, we informed her that we had requested more chips and salsa, but we hadn't received it yet.  So she put in a ""rush order"" for more chips, and they were served to us in no time! * Jack Daniel's Burger ($9.69) - Since I hate raw onions and don't like pickles in my burger, we had asked for those items to be placed on the side and not inside the burger.  We had also requested for the burger to be cut in half, and for an extra Jack Daniel's sauce.  Unfortunately, the only request that was followed was the extra sauce.  I gave my brother the onions and pickles, and he cut the burger in half (which is a pain to do 'cuz it gets messy).  Fortunately, the burger itself was delicious!  Per the menu description, this burger consists of TGI Friday's ""Signature Jack Daniel's® sauce, applewood-smoked bacon and melted provolone cheese atop a fire-grilled Black Angus Beef Burger.""  The Angus beef patty was juicy and flavorful, the Jack Daniel's sauce was sweet and slightly tangy, and the bacon was thick and delicious.  The seasoned fries tasted fine but there wasn't much of it that came with the burger. * Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta ($13.69) - Our server had informed us that this pasta is spicy, but we really didn't think it would be.  It turned out to have a nice, slight heat to it!  The chicken was cooked slightly charred, deliciously sautéed with shrimp and red bell peppers, and tossed with fettuccine noodles and spicy Cajun Alfredo sauce.  It may not look very appetizing, but it was really good, and we were satisfied with the amount of shrimp and chicken in it.  I would definitely get this again. Overall, this TGI Friday's gets 3.5 stars because while the service wasn't so great, the food was very good!  Aside from the times we had to wait for our chips and again for the check to pay, we had an enjoyable dinner there.  I will definitely return to this TGI Friday's for its cleanliness and convenient location, but I hope they will work on their service - especially considering the fact that they weren't really busy the last time we were there.

4,Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572.0,3.0,2013-01-14,"My friends and I came here for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon. The place was certainly not busy or crowded because it was around 1:45 pm after the lunch crowd had left. The hostess was friendly and showed us our table right away. Not long afterwards, our waitress showed up to get our drink orders. She did not write anything down after we told her the drinks we needed. It took her a few minutes to get our drinks to us.  I started to walk around to check out the place and the hostess was wondering if we were leaving since we waited a while for our drinks to show up. I told her I was getting a little restless and I went back to our table but still had to wait a while on the waitress to get our orders. When she arrived, she promptly took orders and did not ""need"" to write anything down. We did not think much of it since the drink orders came back accurate for all four of us. We had 2 Friday's Pick 3 for All in the Appetizers section, a Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad and a Turkey Burger.                                                                     After a long wait, the food finally came out. For the appetizers, my friend had boneless wings, loaded potato skins and warm pretzels with beer-cheese dipping sauce. The other appetizer was basically the same. Boneless wings, warm pretzels with beer-cheese dipping sauce but with fried Mozzarella. The appetizers all came with 4 dipping sauces and celery sticks. My friends all enjoyed it. I had the Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad with Ranch dressing as my entree. It had Balsamic marinated chicken breast that was fire-grilled and drizzled with balsamic glaze. I enjoyed the romaine lettuce with sliced avocado, grape tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, applewood-smoked bacon and crumbled bleu cheese with my Ranch dressing. You can request any kind of dressing you like. The other friend had a classic Turkey Burger with the normal garnishes. The waitress was able to substitute the fries with some celery sticks for her. The only thing is that she had to request for some ranch dressing to come with her celery sticks. The kitchen did an excellent job with our food. When the bill came, we had to request for a redo because all the drinks were billed incorrectly. I guess the lesson here is to never rely totally on your memory. It would save the waitress some embarrassing moments to redo all the tickets. Overall, TGIF gets 3.5 stars. The food was good and the restaurant was clean. However, the wait is longer than we expected. The waitress apologized for the mixed up in the billing and corrected the situation. I could not imagine coming here when it is crowded especially on the weekends. Yelp 32/365",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

111,Kris H.,"Duluth, GA",2,61,,1.0,2013-03-29,"I will NEVER visit this restaurant again. My boyfriend is Mexican and has very basic English skills (he's learning).  I'm a mixed race woman primarily of black American descent.  We chose Fridays for dinner this past Tuesday because neither of us had ever been.  We were seated promptly by a cheerful hostess and our waitress (who was black) was right behind her.  She, however, was much less pleasant. She stared at the TV while greeting us, caught herself, apologized, and did her ""Welcome to Friday's"" shpeel over.  My boyfriend and I both speak Spanish and so that was how we communicated what we wanted to each other before I would tell the waitress or ask her questions.  Whether this started the attitude she had with us for the rest of the night or not, I don't know.  But what I do know was that she was much less attentive to our table than to the other couples (who were black).  She would ask how they were doing and laugh and joke to them about how she couldn't wait to get off so that she and the other employees could mix drinks at the bar. She passed our table four times without saying a word to finish her conversations with the other tables NEXT to ours.  When she finally came to collect our orders, I interpreted some questions that my boyfriend had about making substitutions of sauces for a pasta he wanted.  ""No,"" Before I could finish  the question.  ""No,"" again when he asked for added veggies.  Her tone of voice made it sound as if we ordered an item they would never sell and her expressions were less than professional.  My boyfriend's pasta came out within 20 minutes.  Not bad on the time, horrible on appearance. The pasta we'd ordered was supposed to be-or so we thought-covered in marinara sauce.  We barely saw any.  It had been heaped on his plate, topped with sliced chicken breast and everything was brown due to a sauce that had been poured on.  I tasted his pasta and it was almost as sweet as sugar!  He was going to try and eat it because he didn't ""want to upset her anymore than we already had,"" but I called her over to make sure that we had the right dish. I explained that the pasta hadn't come like we thought that it would.  ""You wanted spinach and mushrooms, pasta and chicken.  The marinara's right here.""  When I asked her about the brown sauce in his dish, she put her knee on a vacant chair at our table and a hand on her hip.  ""It's not sauce, it's balsamic,"" she said. ""And it's not in the pasta, it's on top.""  I asked the waitress to bring us a menu so that we could choose a different dish in case my boyfriend didn't like it.  She shrugged, grabbed a menu, DROPPED it on our table and walked off.  She came back in about 3 minutes and resumed her knee-in-chair, hand-on-hip position.  ""So, did you like it or do you want something else?""  My boyfriend asked me in Spanish why she was raising her voice and she looked down and made one of the nastiest faces I have ever seen in my life. At that point, I'd had enough.  I asked if I could speak to her manager (Jessica).  She nodded and zipped off.  Once I had explained the situation to Jessica, she, of course, apologized about the waitress's behavior, but tried to say that she was probably in a hurry and didn't mean to come off as brusque.  She offered to change our server and our menu choices and went off to have a talk with our waitress.  The waitress emerged from her ""talk"" with a smile and briskly walking towards the bar.  ""Yo,"" she was yelling to one of the male employees.  I've no doubt that she was talking about us..  Every time that she walked past our table for the rest of the night, she would burst out laughing or start talking loudly.  The only thing that kept me from leaving was how politely our new waiter Joseph served us.  He was all smiles, very attentive (he'd even taken a picture for some of the women he'd been waiting on) and an absolute professional.  Every time he passed our table-even though he was working 6 of them-he asked how we were doing.  He offered us dessert on the house as well.  We left him a hefty tip for being so accommodating.  The waitress that had been at our table before wished us a ""great night"" with a smirk on her face and let us know that we were ""welcome to come back any time."" Having worked in customer service for 10 years, I know what is and isn't acceptable behavior in the workplace.  The waitress would not have made it past the interview process if I were her super.  I have never been made feel how she made me feel with my boyfriend that night, and I will never eat here again.  If you do decide to go, the food is average at best.  If possible, ask for Joseph (tall, thin guy with glasses) and avoid the 5' 5-ish dark-skinned black waitress with red weave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=120,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

If I found out that he moved to a new restaurant, I would give up TGI Friday's as a whole.  His wisdom has proven to me that he truly understands his industry and a decision to leave the famed Friday's chain would be good enough for me to boycott the place.  I mean, that would indicate that there is something terribly wrong with this franchise as a whole.  Cheers to you Jacob.

52,Charlie H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,4,5.0,3.0,2015-06-26,"For my first review ever... YAY!! I will review the ""oh-so-famous"", and one of my personal favorites, TGI Friday's! This diner has been one of my favorite places to go every since I was child. Their food, service, and ambiance has always been great! Well, for me at least.  However, it was until recently that I have experienced a somewhat disappointment in this place. I would first like to compliment on the server I had that day for she was very kind and helpful to my table. She always had a smile on her face and she never once given attitude or any other negative energy that we customers sometimes get when eating in diners, or other restaurants similar to this. So as for her service, it was superb, I wish I remembered her name, but i just can't think of it... Moving on to the more juicy subjects. When dining at TGI Friday's, customers who have a Stripes Card are usually given complimentary chips and salsa, yum! However, it was not so yum as I expected. When the chips and salsa came out, the chips were STALE and COLD! Not a good way to start. However, what was more offensive was when we asked for more fresher and hotter chips and dip, for we partially ate this terrible batch and wanted a better batch, two other workers (not my initial server) came to us and gave us a look of ""these not good enough?"", and one of them actually had the audacity to try and put our practically empty salsa cup on our table, implying we should eat what was left in that cup with our new batch. That did not do, so I kindly told him to take it and give us a new salsa cup entirely. After this whole shinanigens... the chips and dip came out like it should have came out initially, hot and fresh! Moving onto entrees! Now, I am all for burgers, so when I ordered their popular Jack Daniel's burger, it was until after I ordered I realized that the server (yes, my kind server) did not ask me how I wanted the meat to be cooked (rare, medium, well-done, etc.). It turned out to be well-done, but luckily for her and their chef, I actually don't mind eating well-done meats (I usually prefer medium to well-done). The burger was to my liking, thankfully; however, they need to be more conscientious on things like this, for other customers who take these things seriously. The french fries were very good! No complaints on that! So overall I give them a three stars for our kind server and a good meal! I hope they improve on their overall service and food quality because I will be going back, but maybe I'll try a different location... Thanks for reading! Happy Yelping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=40,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.9320000000000002,1.92
12,Knuckle H.,"Duluth, GA",0,3,,1.0,2015-06-27,"Popped in and tried the Smoke Stacked burger. First off, the burger, then the service. The burger was ok, not great. The meat patties closely resembled the patties from a McDonalds Big Mac, which is not what I expect on a nearly $13 hamburger. They try to dress it up with 2 sauces, cole slaw, bacon, and sausage, but you can only put so much lipstick on a pig. I would prefer to have a higher quality beef with enough flavor to stand on it's own and not need all the additional stuff. Sure, the other stuff is nice, but get the basics right first. And really, make some attempt at having the food in the menu pics look similar to the item that ends up on the table. Showing a picture of a Lamborghini and giving me a Kia is not a good way to do business. A good example of this is the sausage. In the picture there are sizeable chunks of sausage sticking out from underneath the bun. In reality, I had to search through the cheese and try to identify what the tiny chunks were. Some of them were onions, a few seemed to be sausage of some sort. Secondly, the service. Hostess was pleasant, the waitress was nice and had some personality. I'm not looking for a new best friend, but it's good when the wait staff acts like they want you to be there. The problem was that my aforementioned burger came out wrong. Like a completely different burger than what I ordered. No biggie, mistakes happen. They always seem to happen when I'm really, hungry, but hey... that's life. The second burger comes out and it's the right burger, but it's missing several ingredients. The waitress tells me she'll go get the missing ingredients. I'm hungry, so I give her about 20 seconds, and then I just start eating. So the manager comes back over, and without me saying a word about the situation which was entirely their fault, she says very snidely, ""Oh, I didn't know it was a race"" as I had nearly finished the burger by the time they brought out the missing ingredients. That kinda ticked me off. Thanks for insinuating I'm a pig for eating so quickly, and making it my fault that my burger was incomplete, even though I already gave you two chances to get it right and I was starving. I will not be back. I can get a much better burger cheaper at someplace like Ruby Tuesday. And while they occasionally make mistakes, they've always owned up to them and never got snotty. I will also add that it would have been nice for the TGIFriday manager to make some attempt to make me happy... knock a couple bucks off the bill, give me a coupon, a free dessert... something. She did *nothing*. Not even an apology for the mix ups. Sorry TGI Friday, there are tons of restaurants in this area.

We all ordered the endless appetizers, paying the $12 so we could sample multiple types. Each time an order came out we put the order in for the next one. It was 15-20 min before the next apps showed up- that's crazy. The bartender said its because with the endless, they usually come out slower than everything else. That probably should have been on the promotional flyer or told to us when we decided to do it, but I digress. My 2nd app, potstickers, were burnt. We found out later the person preparing them was in the midst of an argument with the manager and allowed them to burn. She was sent home, my husbands order came out perfectly for his 3rd round.

It took them quite sometime to notice us at the entrance and led us to our table.  I ordered shrimp pasta and Jack Daniel's steak with shrimps and sides. It took around 30 minutes for the food to be served. The shrimp pasta was extremely salty, almost as though half a bottle of salt poured in it. The pasta itself was overcooked, definitely not al dente. I would say a 1/10. As for the Jack Daniel's Steak, it came without shrimps. They missed out the shrimps and charged for the price of what I ordered. After clarifying with the waiter, he managed to get the sides but it took another 20 minutes of wait for it to be served, missing the point of having a side dish with entrée. The taste of the steak was overcooked, making it hard to chew, the sides of mac and cheese was ok, and as for the shrimps it came too late and it came straight right out from the kitchen so it was extremely hot, serving with the long wait steak. I give the steak rating of 3/10. While having the meal, the waiters were not attentive, no one noticed when I asked for water or even raised my hands to get their attention. It took them around another 10 minutes or so for them to realize there were actually customers sitting there and needed water.  When I asked for bill, again it took such a long time for them to come over and of course took them a long time to return the bill after paying.

Grab a cot, blanket and your tablet with movies loaded because you're going to spend a long time here.  My cousin and I went to TGI Fridays because they have great specials. We sat fairly quickly and waited...for a very long time. Maybe this was the self-serve location.  Waiter finally arrived but apparently wasn't aware we had been sitting there. No biggie. It wasn't that long in reality...but you've seen the Snickers commercials. It's real. I want food now!  Our waiter prepared us that the ""endless appetizer"" special would take a long time. He did. But $12 is $12. And endless is endless. And we were very hungry. So his warnings went unfortunately ignored.  He also didn't write down our orders. I should have known then that something was up. I asked for a straw from the waiter for my drink and he never came back. I hope he's okay.  A second waiter come over to take our order. Okay? Never met you, no introduction...but I suppose you're over here for a reason. He was nice though.  Turns out that the waiter at the table next to us never came back either. Maybe our waiters went off together and had a happily ever after. Wouldn't you watch that movie? I would...but I would also wonder about those girls that never got their food.  --- Meanwhile, while we were waiting on our food, someone turned the music up. I thought that I was going to both starve and go deaf. The last thing I'd ever hear is the croonings of Ursher.  --- Finally the food came. The food is the only thing saving this place. I suppose when the cooks have to go hunt the cow down to raise it, butcher it by hand, let it marinate for three full moons, and cook it, that the food would be good. That's how long it took.  Speaking of food, throughout the whole night servers kept coming up to the table with food that we didn't order. Stop. Too hungry for your temptations. Maybe use numbers for the tables. Seems like a nice and efficient method. Right now the orders must come out saying ""walk food to tables near the speakers--yell 'IS THIS YOURS?' as loudly as you can, and hope for the best.""  ---- After three fortnights, we were granted with our bill.

We ordered 1 Long Island, a lemonade, and a pick 3 appetizer. We saw the server ring in our order right away. That was about the only positive part of our experience.  Next, our drinks took 18 minutes to get to our table. Our appetizer arrived about 20 minutes after. In the meantime, the host stand that was right behind where we were seated, remained hostless.  In terms of atmosphere, it was very dull. All of the televisions were set to volley ball. When we asked if we can see the NBA playoffs on one tv, we were told that we could not.  Appetizers arrived with no side plates. We had to continuously search the room to gain the attention of our server. At the end, we told the server that we will look over the menu, and may order something else. After being left for about 20 more minutes, we asked for the check and paid right away. God only knows how long we would have had to wait for our server to come back if we didn't pay right away. Adding disgust to it all, I looked up and saw our server ""playing"" with her hair. I am big on hygiene, and have worked in food service before. I could only imagine the amount of germs that were transferred to us from the server.

Seated at 945 ordered from the endless appetizer menu. 3 party table two appetizers came put an hour later.  The third persons appetizer stilll had not come out at 1100.  The manager comes out  and says there aren't any potato skins.  So we have been waiting for over an hour and a half for an item that is not in the kitchen.  That is just one out of 5 complaints,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=40,2.0,2.05,2.05,,2.0300000000000002

Everything was okay, then as me and my family noticed including my 2 year old, was that it had been almost 20 minutes, and we were not yet greeted or taken care of by a server. There was 2 servers that walked pass us several times and never said a word. After 25 minutes of sitting and looking around my daughter, whose 2 by the way goes, ""Excuse Me!"" Really loud and toddler like, we were still ignored. Then finally one of those same servers that kept walking pass several times, tries to walk her rude behind up and greet? We said, ""No Thanks"", and literally went somewhere else. We were undeserving of that treatment when all we wanted was to eat peacefully as a family. On top of that, a week or two prior, we came in and this time my Dad came to visit for my bday, and we were served by the slowest server ever! I mean it literally took 10 minutes to get ranch! I will never come back ever, you've lost a pretty frequent guest.

It's not even half of a brownie. Looks like those aunt debbie's you grab at kroger and slap on a scoop of great value ice cream on top Turkey Burger - 10$ - Didn't try it cus my friends had it.  - Complaint about this is you literally get as much fries as small as chipmunk's hands.

While we generally have a pleasant meal, today's experience was not the best.  My husband's beer glass was chipped in 2 areas.  You have to wonder why the bartender didn't throw the glass away and why our server didn't notice it before she placed it on our table.  We ordered side salads and asked for dressing on the side and both came with dressing poured over the salads.  Not tragic but I believe this indicates lack of attention by the server.  We both ordered sizzling chicken and cheese and were very pleased with our meals.  However, be prepared to have slow service at this restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2,1.84,2.01,2.01,,1.942

I don't mind the genre, but good grief...I also wouldn't mind variety and for it to be turned down a few notches.  The servers are kinda slow.

I have never in my life experience such awful service from management regarding food my entire life. In a group of 4 women we all ordered drinks and food on this Friday. However, when I ordered the endless appetizers I was not satisfied with my potato skins with Kraft cheese or my boneless wings. I ordered mozzarella sticks just to try to be fair and not judge the restaurant on the lack of my liking and still pay for my bill. After being dissatisfied and not finishing ANY of my food I asked the waitress what could be done so everyone could be satisfied and the manager came to our table with a complete attitude. He had a lack of customer service and professionalism by raising his voice and putting his hands into my face. No longer even wanting to eat we asked for out ticket and to-go boxes and was given 7 miniature to-go boxes for an ENTIRE rack of ribs and watched management try to tell out waitress not to give us the correct to go containers. After the ordeal with the male management that was on staff we requested to speak to the other on shift manager just to diffuse the situation and find a resolution however she would not come to our table. We had food that came out to our table and looked like it had already been eaten on, broccoli that was brown and food.

We waited 15 min to be seated when there were more than 5 tables open and there were others behind our family waiting. Once we sat down it took forever for the waitress to come over to take out orders. An hour later we still don't have our food and people who were seated before us had eaten and left (same party size) the only time something got done was when we spoke to the manager of course which we got our appetizer for free but other than the music, the service was horrible!

37,Judy B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",91,4,1.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"Went here for a quick dinner only because it was convenient and two minutes away from my apartment. We were sat quickly and the waitress took our order promptly. Only reason why it deserves one star. I ordered the baby back ribs with the seasoned fries and coleslaw. Waitress brought the food out, but offered no utensils. So I started on my fries and lo' and behold, I found a hair in the food. Not wanting to cause a scene and because I was starving, I decided to put it to the side and address it later when our waitress came back. Found a second hair halfway through my fries (still no utensils by the way, and no waitress to be seen) and by this point, I felt sick. Told our waitress once she finally made it back to us that there were multiple hair found in my fries and instead of taking my entire plate back, she went and got me a smaller plate of fries to replace it. Didn't even bother to pick up the first plate back until we asked her. Gave them the benefit of the doubt AGAIN and halfway through my baby back ribs, I find another piece of hair. Asked the waitress for the manager and the manager took her sweet ol' time to sit down and talk to us. At this point, I just wanted to pay and leave. She didn't accept fault, told me that all her cooks in the back were men, nobody had the hair type that I had show her, and it's weird that I found hair in different places when I was trying to explain to her that they were all on one plate. Then she ended up taking my picture and told me that it was for filing claim purposes, but really she just wanted to send my picture out to other restaurants to see if it was some dine and ditch stunt. Since I clearly did not put hair in my own food, I happily obliged. The management here is terrible, and the only reason I did not want to cause a scene was because I was starving and exhausted from work. The least they could have done was apologized. In the end, we offered to pay for the drinks we finished and left. This place did not deserve how courteous we were tonight.

There was a large group of Teens from Discovery for an after Homecoming Outing. There was also a DJ.. DJ Leo I believe he played a nice mix of music and some patrons participated in Karoke. The staff wore their Halloween Costumes which added to the festive Halloween decoration hung. My Bartender!! She wore a Mermaid Costume that I absolutely loved along with her partner as a Unicorn. They were a great duo working fast and providing great Customer Service. When the food arrived it was fresh and warm.

This place is gross!). When we finished and asked our server for two bills split by party, our server said he did not know how to do that, but he could bring us 9 bills, one for each person and one for each drink order!  We thought he was kidding, but that is exactly what he did - he presented us with 9 bills!  Careful about taking children to a place with employees who are clearly impaired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2,1.8,1.92,1.92,,1.8719999999999999

The renovation (to me) has drastically changed the ambiance. It also seems more ""kid-friendly"" to me and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I guess I don't think a sports bar-type restaurant should be kid-friendly... am I the only one who feels this way?? Well, besides all of that, the host was outstanding!
