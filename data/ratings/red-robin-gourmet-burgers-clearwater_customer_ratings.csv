39,Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211.0,5.0,2012-08-19,"My first time at a Red Robbin -- and this was opening weekend in Clearwater. The place was crowded, but they will send you a text when your table is ready, so you are fee to walk around the mall area (just watch to bad cellular reception areas). Once inside the service was good and the food came quickly even with a big crowd.  The burgers were very good, and lots of choices.  All burgers come with bottomless steak fries -- and they are generous with them.  Some speciality drinks are bottomless too, including a Barqs rootbeer float, which is only $3.19 for as many as you want--and they even offer you one to go. There are lots of non-burger options too, including chicken, salads, and even hummus. Biggest problem here is parking.  This end of the mall has been really over-developed at the expense of parking spaces.  There is a lot of free parking, but you might not be very close. The prices are reasonable, but not cheap -- remember this is not fast food.  All in all, a great experience and we will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=40,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
118,Sarah B.,"Littleton, CO",4,85,6.0,4.0,2012-08-19,"Location just opened and this was our first time ever at a Red Robin. As packed as it was for lunch, the wait was only about 15 minutes for 2 of us. We were sat at a table barely a foot away from the table next to us,  so the lack of privacy was a little uncomfortable. Being vegetarians, we were pleased that there were 2 different veggie burgers (Morningstar Veggie or Boca Vegan) that could be subbed on any burger! I tried the just the regular Veggie which had carmelized onions and zucchini on it....delicious!  Next time I will try subbing a veggie patty on one of the other burgers. Fries were also fresh and piping hot. Was a big portion, so I had leftovers for dinner. Maria was our server and was terrific, especially given how busy it was. Overall,  we thought it was a little pricey - cost us almost $40 for 1 appetizer, 2 sodas, 2 burgers and tip. But we will be back since the food was good and it is difficult to find restaurants that have such great vegetarian options....which says a lot since this is a burger place. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=100,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

The hamburgers are not the biggest out there, but they are the tastiest! The steak fries were hot and taste real good with that Red Robin special seasoning (that we purchased, by the way, for $3 for a huge bottle). The sweet tea was very good! (It's hard to find good sweet tea out there!)  My son got one of the beer milkshakes and he was completely impressed. He actually wasn't expecting it to taste so good. He did say that he'd ask them to leave off the caramel next time around though, it was a bit much as far as flavor clashing. They did tell us that they also do a milkshake using Bailey's and that was tempting, but my hubby was driving and I didn't wanna drink it in front of him...lolll. The milkshakes are $4.95. It wasn't crowded and since it was so cold in the mall, we opted to sit outside. The outside patio was nice and clean and the server kept regular check on us.

But I have trouble giving a restaurant that serves its food in plastic baskets and charges 10-12 dollars a meal more than 3 stars.  I ordered a burger with a special set of toppings and it came out exactly as ordered. My wife the vegetarian even was able to get a vegan burger (made by boca) with avacado and other toppings.

105,Lane R.,"Dunedin, FL",53,118,4.0,2.0,2012-11-05,"Having seen commercials for Red Robin forever, this was my first experience at one. For the longest time I honestly thought it was a fast food restaurant and by the end of our meal we agreed the food was about on par with fast food. For a chain burger joint I suppose this place is alright, but there are plenty of better local restaurants to grab a fresh burger at.  We stopped in around 8:00pm on a Saturday and it appeared they were just coming off of a wait. We only had to wait a few minutes for them to clean a table. Our server was a little hard to keep at our table. We ordered our drinks and before we could ask for an appetizer she was off. I hate when I order an appetizer and it comes out at the same time as my meal (this looked like the kind of place it would happen at) so I always try to give them a good 10-15 minutes between ordering. For an appetizer we picked the fried jalapenos and mushrooms. The jalapenos were good and fresh. They were pretty spicy, but the mushrooms could have been better they were soggy.  I got the bleu cheese burger and my husband ordered the only spicy one on the menu. They were alright, but the patty looked like it was previously frozen, as most chains are.  The fries were decent. We paid with a gift card which apparently you can't leave a tip on. Well our server just dropped our card off at the table and ran. We only had a $20 and had the hardest time getting her attention to get change. Apparently she didn't want a tip, because I tried to flag her down 3 times and finally I just grabbed another server. I doubt we will be back anytime soon, but we wanted to say we had tried it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=100,3.208,3.208,3.208,3.208,3.208
16,Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800.0,4.0,2012-11-20,"On a recent trip to Clearwater, Florida, I had the chance to eat at a Red Robin.  First of all, the menu is filled with a wide variety of burgers.  Though there are burgers you can order as is from a simple lettuce and tomato version to a spicy jalapeno burger that will set your mouth on fire, every burger can be customized to tailor to your needs.  In our case, my dinner companion Chad chose to substitute the regular all beef patty for the veggie option.  Red Robin offers a veggie burger, a vegan soy burger, a turkey burger and the most popular beef patty.  Or, if a burger just isn't your thing at all, you can substitute fish, grilled chicken, blackened chicken or a crispy chicken patty. My dinner date opted for the veggie burger slipped into the Burning Love burger and it was a spicy lover's dream.  Crispy fried jalapeno slices, a spicy salsa and pepperjack cheese on a jalapeno-cornmeal Kaiser roll.  Well, in addition to substituting the burger patty, Chad switched the pepperjack for blue cheese and a whole grain bun instead of the jalapeno Kaiser roll.  And it was still spicy.  And it was delicious.  It was mouthwatering. Speaking of mouthwatering, I had the Prime Chophouse burger.  They had me at horseradish sautéed mushrooms.  Add provolone cheese and crispy onion straws and you had me at hello.  I went for the beef patty version.  It was cooked perfectly (I ordered it medium), it was juicy, I got a taste of those horseradish mushrooms with every bite. My only complaint is that it was HUGE!!!  The burger patty is 6oz. which for me is enormous, however you can request a smaller patty (which will also lower the price by $2).  Everything can be customized- from the bun to the cheese to the sauces to the toppings to the burger patty itself.  Add a side of their ""bottomless"" fries and you are set.  Chad took advantage of the bottomless fries- his second serving of fries was bigger than the first.  They do not skimp. All Red Robin locations also have a full bar with a wide selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Next time I am getting the Salted Caramel Milkshake- somehow I missed that on the menu the first time around (I was just too busy building my dream burger). I now have my Red Robin bucket list.  We signed up for the Red Royalty card- they have some very serious generous offers.  Visit 5 times in the next 5 weeks and get $20 off our meal.  Every 10th entrée is free.  Free burger on your birthday (those are always my favorite loyalty perks).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=20,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472

Let me tell you about this Red Robin milkshake.  It was vanilla, and ICE cold, obviously made from quality ice cream.  Part of it was served in a cold glass and the rest of it was in the cold metal mixing container.  It was thick, and sweet, and the vanilla flavor was definitely prominent (a good thing).  It was better than a Steak n Shake milkshake including the days when Steak n Shake used real ice cream.

My husband always orders the Whiskey River BBQ chicken sandwich, topped with cheddar, barbeque sauce, and crispy onions.  I tend to order the Southwest Grilled Chicken salad: it has chicken, avocado, red and green bell pepper, black beans, corn, cheese, and fried jalapeno coins.

81,Cara D.,"Clearwater, FL",15,62,3.0,5.0,2013-05-03,"Bottomless root beer floats. That's really all I need to say to justify a full five stars. You pay like $3.50, and you can have as many root beer floats as you can manage. They bring out one large mug with the root beer and ice cream, plus a second glass of super-chilled root beer so you can add more to your float as desired. As soon as I've managed to consume about half of my float, my waiter/waitress for the evening is right there, asking if I want a refill. Do I want a refill? Do you really have to ask? Bring it on!! But Red Robin is known as a burger joint, and not a root beer float joint. So if their root beer floats are divine, their burgers must be pure ambrosia, right? Right! We've never had a burger we haven't liked at Red Robins. They have a massive selection, including two different types of vegetarian burgers. The burgers also come with a bottomless basket of fries, but the burger and float will more than fill you up. The food comes out very fast, even when they are completely slammed. It's always fresh and tasty. There was one time that I had a dish I did not enjoy - one evening I found their prime rib dip to be overly salty, and at the end of the meal, the waitress commented on my nearly-full sandwich. I explained the situation (which hadn't really bothered me - I had filled up on root beer floats!), and told her not to worry about it. Instead, a couple of seconds later a manager appeared and promised to make everything right. They comp'ed my meal and were completely apologetic. Their customer service was completely unbelievable! We didn't make a fuss, didn't even consider it a problem, but they treated it like one and have gained customers for life (actually, the root beer floats already guaranteed that, so I guess they just gained very, very happy repeat customers). The only negative is the parking - it's situated on a bad side of the mall, where the parking lot is itty bitty, and you either have to drive around waiting for a spot, park halfway across the mall, or pay for the new valet option. This isn't Red Robin's fault, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=80,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732
56,Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670.0,3.0,2013-05-18,"At first I contemplated giving Red's a 4 star, but I have been there almost every weekend with my kids since it opened in March and the service has gone downhill GREATLY. The burgers are amazing though, as long as the kitchen quality doesn't go down like the service did.  My last six visits in the past 2 months are as follows: Red's is not packed anymore and has obviously lost it's grand opening ""magic"". There is no excuse for excessive wait time or poor service. The servers are all very young and flighty. The last few I've had didn't ask if we needed a refill and walked past our table without seeing how we were doing.  If you ask for an appetizer or ""bottomless"" fries up front while you wait 30 mins for your decadent burger, count your blessings if you get the fries at all. Half the time you get the appetizer 5-10 minutes before your main meal is placed before you've taken your second bite of starters. So it takes 25 minutes to make an appetizer?  Over all, it's a great family dining establishment since kids don't write reviews on yelp nor do they care about service, but as an adult, they need get out of their complacent comfort zone and realize that in Countryside, young families and couples are long over due for new and fresh places to eat. The economy is booming and new places are popping up everywhere. The instant another family friendly establishment opens near by, they will suffer greatly. Try the blue ribbon burger for a party in your mouth...TNT drink is really strong and yummy. Also the lemonades come in neat glasses are have free refills.

I ordered the Turkey burger and told them, no Red Robin spice, cant have spices at all. Turkey plain with Lettuce. First bite revealed that this was full of spices. UGH! My mouth was hot from pepper, that much I could identify. My head tightens , I get a bubble blister in my mouth I often get from foods with chemicals, preservatives... etc. Shoot , I look at the burger and I can tell its not ""real ground turkey like I expected... its processed yuk... looks like what pink slime/mechanically separated meat.   ( google that)  . Now I am  really disappointed .. I thought it they were famous for their burgers it would be a real ground burger.  Nope.

6,Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",848,2344,2391.0,4.0,2013-09-08,"Stopped in today after finding out that my favorite Thai place didn't open until 4.  Since Red Robin was close by and I had an errand to run at the mall, the husbeast and I decided why not.  What we first noticed is that they've got advertising up for their new autumn menu, including the Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer and their Pretzel burger.  This piqued the husbeast's interest and me, well, I'm a simple creature, I just wanted MEAT!  We perused the new slick menu layout - instead of being a fold out menu, they've now got newly photographed food offerings in a book style menu- and i chose to have the French dip, as a starter, we chose their pretzel bites. I've had them in the past and they've been delicious, today though, they were a disappointment. The cheese was clumpy and the bites themselves tasted microwaved and over salted.  The way the food is presented is much prettier now. Gone are the plastic baskets, now food comes neatly arranged on plates, fries come served in hammered steel buckets. Everything looks slick and delicious.  They even offer 7 different sauces for your fries that are standard, and a few other sauces that are premium for an up-charge. This is something new.  Our entrees were served quickly and as ordered. They were delicious! The food and the service was excellent.  Since I've been on a restricted diet, I ended up having to take half my meal home.

However, this Red Robin has some of the best service I have experienced anywhere in my recent memory. Zack deserves a raise. He was totally awesome. Friendly, fast, knowledgable, and so much more. We ate lunch at Gators out on Treasure Island. We had the most awful service there. After we went parasailing. Then we met my fiancée's dad and step mom for dinner at this Red Robin location. We were so thankful for good service after our lunch service experience. We went here for the amazing milkshakes. The peach milkshake was unbelievable, it was so unique and full of flavor.  My fiancee and I shared the bruschetta burger. It was very good, and compliment so well by the sweet potato fries.

I had two bites of the burger and was finished, when I decided I would at least fill up on the endless fries. Our first batch of fries were luke-warm, so we asked our waitress if we could have more, and asked if they would be fresh. She assured us they would be. When the new batch came out, they were fire hot, but tasted like they had been cooked once, let sit to cool, then simply dunked in the fryer again.  I may be nitpicking at this point, but when the second round of fries weren't that great, I let the waitress know about my burger, and asked politely if we could just take it off the bill, which her and her manager did. The manager then came out and notified me that the burger patties for the double-tavern burger were different than the normal burger patties they use for every other burger, so that may explain the taste.

Their catch phrase is so easy to get stuck in my head everytime I see one of their commercials and I basically want to say it over and over whenever I eat one of their tasty burgers here too. I just love all the additions that have been made to the mall in the last couple years and this is one of them. Very nice to have a few sit down choices with good service and a decent meal for not alot of money. Beware of the parking situation here, it never used to take so long to find a spot but now this whole mall is so busy sometimes it takes at least a few minutes of driving in circles to find an available spot. I like how they have so many options for customizing your sandwich, whether it be a burger or a chicken patty, whole wheat bun, regular bun or lettuce wrap for those on a low carb diet and plenty of other options to make it just how you like. They also have some gluten free options here which I'm sure is much appreciated by the folks who cannot eat gluten but still want a delicious burger. I was also impressed with the fries here, they were crispy and fresh, definitely a thumbs up. Besides their wide selection of burgers, they also have some salads, soups and other options to satisfy any craving. There is a full liquor bar as well and quite a few TVs mounted around the restaurant if you're wanting to watch the big game. The service has varied here on each visit, from average to above average, so can't complain there.

31,Scott H.,"Clearwater, FL",129,187,230.0,4.0,2013-11-23,"I told the lady waiting my table that this was very superior experience compared to the last Red Robin I went to.  This was my first visit to this location and I really enjoyed the décor, food and service. All of which was very delightful.   From the outside this place looks like a sidewalk burger place; I was thoroughly amazed at the space that was inside.  It was huge!  There were so many booth and table combinations that I really could not tell that there was a bar to the left.  The walls were covered with different variations of ""memorabilia"" type art. Some of which was extremely creative.  The back wall was the kitchen which was ""a buzz"" with activity creating and delivering the menu items. My visit began with a warm greeting from the smiling hostess who quickly observed and informed me that it was going to be a moment.  She was true to her observation.  It a short moment another pleasant staff member came and took me to my table.  I was really impressed with her initiative, as we approached the table I was to set at it was obvious it was not ready, she did not blink an eye or make it known to me, she proceeded to the next section and solved the curve ball thrown to her.  Kudos to her, no so much kudos for whoever was supposed to bus the table. It was a very short time before my table was approached and my order was taken.  I wanted just a simple burger. Sure enough, they have a ""simple burger"" on the menu.  I ordered it medium and found out it came with all the garnishments I wanted.  The burger came out with a lightly toasted bun cooked exactly medium with the garnishments on the side.  The waitress promptly brought mayonnaise and mustard and I stacked the lettuce tomato and onion topping the burger.  The burger was warm and inviting with flavor topped with an orchestra of fresh and cool toppings.  Delightful!  The fries were bottomless and I was sorry that I could not do more than one order.  They were fresh, hot, and thick steak fries.  Very good.  Warning: the fries come in what looks like a silver cup it is actually a ring and if you are not careful moving it fries could get a way and that would be bad. Definitely a stop when visiting the mall or even worth a special trip.

98,Myles D.,"Bradenton, FL",0,2,,5.0,2014-01-17,"In 2003, red robin introduced a tantalizing menu item - Red's Nantucket Seafood Scatter. The whole dish has a clear, crisp taste, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the dish a big boost. In 2005, they released perhaps their most accomplished dish - Riblets & Mac'n'cheese. A dish so catchy, most people probably don't realize what they are eating. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasure of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the restaurant itself. If you are looking for lighter fare, it's hard to choose a favorite among so many great dishes.  But I suggest the 'Avo-cobb-o' - a fun little twist on a not-so-classic dish.  Their menu says ""It's ripe. For eating"".  I couldn't agree more.  It is one of the best, most powerful menu items created around the idea of self-preservation, dignity.  Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves.  Since it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves.  It's an important message, crucial really.  And it is a beautifully crafted dish on the menu. I do have to say though, their Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap is a bit off the mark.  I don't really understand their work with this dish.  Too artsy, too intellectual.  Their artistic presence really becomes more apparent with their Ensenada Chicken Platter, however.  I think it is the group's undisputed masterpiece.  It's an epic meditation on intangibility.  At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three dishes.  Taste the brilliant ensemble of flavors - you can practically feel every culinary instrument used.  In terms of culinary craftsmanship, this dish hits a new peak of professionalism.  The dish is extremely uplifting, the flavors essentially address the problems of abusive culinary authority.  In all, I think Red Robins gives a new meaning to the dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=80,4.12,4.12,4.12,3.188,4.12

53,Amy S.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",31,7,3.0,1.0,2014-10-29,"First off, let me just say how good the food was! Our burgers and fries were made to order as we requested and the appetizer were all delicious. Unfortunately the service was horrid.  Service: Tues. 10/28/14 5:50 - Ben and I walk into Red Robin, kind of excited since neither of us have been to this location. One couple is in front of us at the hostess stand, but there are only 3-4 tables of people in the restaurant. We are seated relatively quickly.   5:55- Will the Waiter comes over and gets our drink order, Ben asks for a TNT (Long Island) and I order a Mojito, we also put in an order for the Chili-Con-Queso.  6:00- We see that the couple who arrived at the same time as us are now getting their drinks, we start looking around for ours...Will seems to have disappeared.  6:05- Drinks arrive, Ben's TNT looks great, but says it tastes like there is no alcohol in it. Mine looks a little cloudly and tastes like pure lime juice. The waiter happens to be taking orders for the table right next to us (family of 4, 2 kids uder the age of 6, adorable) so I flag him down and let him know what's wrong, he apologizes and says he will fix it, takes the drink and heads to the bar. We can see him talking to the bar tender, she doesn't look offended, yay!  App arrives! Fantastic Queso! We both were very impressed with the quality, I highly recommend the Queso!  6:10- 2nd Mojito arrives, Will asks me to taste it before he leaves (nice gesture). Now the drink tastes like soda water. Still can't taste the mint, or the Rum, or taste/see any sugar in the glass. REALLY?! Sent the drink back again. Dinner orders are placed, 2 tavern doubles, my toppings on the side, Ben asks for cheese and bacon only, with a side of honey mustard.  6:15- A 2nd waitress comes to the table and asks if I would like to order anything else in place of the failed Mojito. I ask for a sweet tea. Disappointment abounds.  6:16-Sweet tea magically appears at the table. Kids at the table next door settle down, their food has arrived.    6:17 - We start playing a round of Trivial Pursuit on the bottle of Heinz ketchup. Ben and I are kicking ass and taking names! 6:25- We have finished 3 full games of trivial pursuit, boredom is setting in. Where is the waiter? Where is our food?  6:30- Finally! Salvation in the form of a burger! Smells great. We tell the food runner that we asked for honey mustard. She says she will be right back, our waiter is still MIA.  6:35- This burger is AWESOME. I totally understand why people like this place. Ben is done with his fries, no honey mustard yet. The couple who came in at the same time as us seem to have left already.  6:37- Honey mustard finally! I use Ben's leftovers on my fries, yummy.  6:40- Ben's kinda itching for more fries, waiter still hasn't even come over to ask how the food is (well, was). Ben and I wonder when the waiter will be back. He's still MIA. Family of 4 has their check and is packing up to leave already.  6:43- Well hey there Mr. Waiter, did you get lost? No? Glad to hear it. We order another round of fries (he said it'll be about 5 mins) I ask for the check, and tell the waiter I have a coupon. He writes down my member number and disappears.  6:50- Waiter stops by with an arm full of food, ""I'll be back in a second, the code didn't work, I need to verify it with you again"" 6:55- I think the waiter got lost again. Second round of fries shows up.  6:56- Ben can't take any more, leaves me his wallet and heads outside for some air.  7:00- New waiter, never seen him before, appologizes profusely, takes my code again. I make a comment about how we have been here for over an hour and we are trying to make a movie in 30 mins. Answer? ""Sorry it's really busy tonight"".  7:11- Waiter drops the check off, arm full of food again, I ask him to come back after he drops that off (no reason to cause other people to wait as long as we did).  7:12- Yes he came right back, I was shocked too. I explained to Will the reason that he was not getting a very nice tip from us. I felt like he poorly managed his time and resources. I explained that there were 5 tables when we first walked in, and yet it took us over a hour to receive drinks, an app and a meal, for 2. I also pointed out that he took over 20 minutes to deliver the check to me after I asked for it. I made a point of telling him that we had arrived so early because we were trying to make a movie and were still disappointed in the timeliness of the service. Will's response was ""you should have told me you were trying to make a movie, I could have put a rush order on it"". LET ME JUST SAY: Whether or not I am trying to make a movie is irrelevent. My service should not be that slow. EVER.  Somebody PLEASE send a corporate trainer to this location. Hire a bartender who can make drinks. Hire waiters who have the ability to handle 6 tables on a Tuesday night. The food was great, I would love to go back, but we will not be returning because of the service.

I couldn't really taste the avocado but the burger was cooked the way I ordered it, medium. The patty size was a little disappointing and not thick like what was pictured in the menu. When you order a burger there, you usually get bottomless fries but since we were doing low carb, we opted for broccoli. Endless broccoli is not the same as endless fries but we were trying to stay healthy and not waste a workout (I think the patrons sitting next to us thought we were weirdos as we kept glancing over at their tables, and were drooling over their fries and onion rings).

With that being the case the food arrived lukewarm and the ""endless"" basket of fries was only refilled once. Which was when we were finished eating and the waiter also brought the cheque, but by then we were already wanting to leave.  Is it better than say, McDonalds? Sure.

58,Christopher S.,"Port Richey, FL",21,3,,3.0,2015-05-15,"Today was my first time visiting a Red Robin. I had heard many good things about them from friends and family and decided to take my Brother out for an early birthday lunch and a movie. The restaurant appeared very clean and service was friendly and professional with just one tiny lapse. The burgers were great and I was happy with the fact that the waitress didn't bat an eye when I ordered mine medium rare. I have had restaurants tell me they won't serve burgers below medium and that just tells me that they don't trust the quality of their meat or kitchen staff. The fries were a bit of a disappointment though. My brother had bragged about how good they were and since we were in shortly after opening at 11 AM, I expected them to be hot and fresh. While they weren't horrible, they weren't very warm and several of mine were very hard, like they had been left to either cook too long or sat under a heat lamp for far too long. Again, they weren't horrible, it just seemed strange for them not to be fresh so early in the day. All in all, I would happily go back again.  My one issue is something that is common to a lot of restaurants. I am a big guy at 6'1"" and around 315 lbs. Many restaurants, Red Robin included, have booths with their tables firmly mounted to the floor. As a hostess, if you have a larger customer coming in, it might behoove you to consider seating your diner somewhere where they can be comfortable. The restaurant was sparsely populated and there were regular tables and chairs, high top tables, and even bar seating that would have been far more comfortable for me rather than having me try and squeeze into a booth. Yes, I know that the simple answer is, ""lose weight!"", but that doesn't change the fact that you should always try and make your customer comfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater?start=60,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9240000000000004,3.2800000000000002

I just don't rate based on service only because that can change day to day. So let's get down to the food. For it being my first time eating at a Red Robin establishment, I was pretty impressed with how their burger tasted. Their burger was not the best I have had but it was actually pretty good. I know I would have loved their French fries if my waitress would have brought them out straight out of the fryer instead of waiting until they were cold and stale tasting.

We were sat immediately and were brought a high chair and booster as asked. For whatever reason the server today was clearly having a bad day. Either she doesn't enjoy her job or the boss was upset with her but she wore her feelings on her face and in the inflection in her voice. It was almost like an imposition asking for a refill on water which for some reason took upwards of about ten minutes. There were maybe four other tables taken in the restaurant. Also it wasn't until our food was served that we realized we didn't have any silverware and upon asking for a fork she responded sure.

They made some changes to the atmosphere/food/prices the past few years trying to make it more upscale, assuming to make it competitive with all the gourmet burger chains that have entered this space. I miss the old fun quirky Red Robin where you get a giant burger and eat way too many fries for less than $10 vs. the slicker atmosphere with smaller burgers and having to ask for at least 1 refill because you get 8 fries in a silver cup with the meal. My 'conspiracy theory' is that they know people will feel uncomfortable asking for several refills so it's a cost-saver in the end. 1 change I do appreciate - offering other substitutions for regular fries - like the endless salad (which I immediately asked for a refill on when my meal was delivered - ha!).

Finally my burger came accompanied by a few warm fries, and I immediately asked my server for another order as these would be finished in no time. While awaiting this order about ten minutes went by. What was left of my burger had by now grown cold, and upon finishing my burger the fries finally arrived. So I mentioned, ""great, NOW you bring the fries, my meal has finished."" At this he laughed, probably thinking I was being funny. But what happened next is why I'm writing this interview. I flagged my server and asked him why my fries took ten minutes, and visually offended at my question he replied, ""things get a little backed up in the kitchen!"" I told him that fries should not take ten minutes, at which time he picked up this plate of cold fries from the other side of my table and slammed them down in front of me and smugly, AND with bad attitude said, ""well, they're here now, enjoy!""

For THIS I would give them 5 stars alone. However the issue I have is with their poor quality beef. I've eaten here several times and at least 2 of the times, I end up with hard nasty pieces in my mouth while eating the burger. Either bone, Or gristle or something. Unappetizing to say the least. When my husband and I had lunch there a few weeks ago, I let the server  know and she was Very apologetic and had them remake the burger for me. Somehow I got another hard bit in one of the first bites I took again! I am wondering if the meat they used for their ""Tavern burger"" is different than their regular. The tavern burger is a little cleaner so maybe that's why? Maybe they're buying low quality beef for those patties to save cost and be able to offer it cheaper?

For the price we paid I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater,3.04,3.36,3.36,,3.2320000000000007
63,Christa P.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,2,,5.0,2018-01-13,Best experience I've ever had at a Red Robin. I have a food allergy (onions) and this place exceeded my expectations to be sure I didn't have anything that would cause a reaction. They even checked the individual ingredients in one of their sauces just to be sure. Thank you to my server Christopher and the Chef Josh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clearwater,3.2,3.36,3.36,,3.2960000000000007
