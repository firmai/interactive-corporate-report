Linda T.,"Houston, TX",445,540,427,4.0,1/2/2018,"Ok, I gotta be honest I haven't eaten here in lord knows how many years. Well the other day we placed an order and got it delivered through GrubHub. We ordered (2) half rack of ribs and some super green veggies, mash potatoes and jasmine rice pilaf. It was so good! I wasn't expecting too much but they lived above their expectations. The ribs were tender and all the sides were nicely prepared and not overly salted. We loved it so much we went into the restaurant a few days later and sat at the bar and ordered the same thing. The best part was they had a special going which I wasn't aware of when I placed the GrubHub ordered, we got a full rack of bbq ribs for only $12! Our server/bartender Isaiah was very nice and attentive. Our food was just as good that day we dined in. Side note they also have different drink specials for each day of the week, and it's all day. The cocktail specials were really cheap, most of them $3! I didn't order any drinks but good to keep in mind for the future. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands
Larry M.,"Spring, TX",0,2,,3.0,12/29/2017,"Hi I'm Larry Mattlock, I'm 60 years young, I served 20 years in the military and have been on multiple tours  to war torn areas of the Vietcong and Korea popping jap heads like pimples on a pre-teen. Anyway, last Friday I visited this restaurant with high expectations (being that the name is Fridays) and I was sorely disappointed. The security there was awful, if that place was ambushed we'd all be dogtags in a pile of bones, but nevermind that. I was quickly seated by a beautiful little host to a booth upon request. I was sat and greeted by my waiter, Dexter. An outgoing and I think homosexual little half black man. He was a sweet guy and tended to my every need. I chose to eat the kids chicken tenders because I'm a goddamn man and I can eat whatever I want. It took a fair 20 minutes to get my chicken tendies which wasn't bad. They were a little to crunchy for my taste but then one of them was fine, so quality control is a thing to worry about. It was better than eating MRE's in a bunker with artillery raining down on us, but that's not saying much. I creeped into the back of the kitchen to swipe some free food and maybe some plates (I broke mine at home after a fit relating to my PTSD threw me into a gunfight with my fine China. I escaped the restaurant without paying because as a veteran and an old man, I've done wayyyyyy to much tax payment and service for some chicken fingers. I'm rating three stars because the plates I stole were dirty and the host upfront wouldn't accept my phone number. I recommend this establishment if you're looking for free plates and bomb ass chicken tenders. BOMB?! TAKE COV- sorry, it's the PTSD. Alrighty yelp I'm signing out, this is your favorite grandpa - Larry Mattlock",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands
Diane P.,"Spring, TX",2,3,,5.0,12/28/2017,"Stopped in for a late night bite... great experience from bar and staff... service was on time and food was what I expected for trendy Friday's... taken off guard you could smoke there, I don't, but it want overbearing or what would consider too much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands

Curtis B.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",38,1,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Went there for lunch today.  We got seated in a booth which was fine.  Once we sat down we noticed a smell as if someone used a dirty mop.  We requested to be moved to another booth thinking it would be better.  It wasn't.  We told the waitress about the smell and she had found out that the carpets were cleaned recently and that's where the smell was coming from.  We ordered a hamburger to share (ordered medium well) came out almost still raw. We sent it back, but when it came out for the second time it still didn't taste good. The dr.pepper wasn't even good. Our waitress was very good and did everything she could to get us taken care of.   The manager did take the hamburger off our tab so we were thankful for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands

Linda A.,"Houston, TX",45,217,104,4.0,1/20/2016,"Our server Thomas was friendly and attentive. Our orders were taken and received in a timely manner. I was concerned about eating here because it's majorly meat, but I tried the Sedona black bean burger and it was amazing. It was very filling. I then tried the Tennessee whiskey cake but the half order for $4 and it was the PERFECT size for one person. Maybe even two since it took me awhile to eat mine. I'd definitely recommend going.

Miss Chelsea S.,"The Woodlands, TX",322,44,132,1.0,8/15/2016,That sure is a lot of paid marketing  for your online ordering not to work!

A K.,"Houston, TX",2,18,,1.0,8/8/2016,We stopped in to have lunch with our children at this location. The service was absolutely lousy for the restaurant being so empty. The food was mediocre and that is being nice. We ordered of the lunch menu and holy crap the bill was off the charts for 5 people.

Alysson B.,"Spring, TX",1,4,2,2.0,9/25/2016,This place has went downhill in my opinion. The appetizer was great but the entrees were lacking. The french fries tasted reheated. The Salmon portion was tiny. They gave me 6 & 1/2 slivers of mushrooms. The sauce was too salty and it did not taste fresh. We won't be going back any time soon. I gave this review a 2 because the server was great and it wasn't his fault. We were unhappy with the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands

Mason B.,"Cypress, TX",2,8,,2.0,1/31/2016,"I took my girlfriend here for a late night meal last month (Dec. 2015) right before the holidays. Since it was after midnight, the place was practically empty, so we were greeted very enthusiastically. Now before I get to the problem, I would like to say that the service we received was great; our server, Eva, was very helpful and nice and did everything that she could for us. The problems came from the kitchen...when my girlfriend received her salad, we noticed a weird, coarse black hair near the edge of her plate. We let our server know, and she apologized profusely and took it off the check. Shortly after, however, we got our drink refills only to find ANOTHER hair wrapped around the glass held in place by the condensation...I've never had that happen twice in one sitting. The food tasted fine overall; I ordered some of the cider-glazed boneless wings and it looked like they were thrown together pretty hastily even though they weren't the least bit busy. Nice service with decent food in a fun part of town; just don't know if I could come back here after the whole hair situation...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-the-woodlands?start=20
Luis G.,"Spring, TX",0,9,10,1.0,5/26/2016,"The only positive thing about here is the atmosphere, other than that, the food is terrible and prices high.

My French dip sandwich was cold and stale and the meat was fatty and tough. My sister's Mac and cheese was cold and they left the cheese out of her tomato and mozzarella salad. My mother's chicken was overdone. Overall is was just disgusting.  I have eaten at a TGI Fridays in Port Charlotte, FL and the food was good.  The only positive was that our waiter was nice.

Leslie G.,"Houston, TX",129,86,65,3.0,11/20/2015,"Sometimes I get caught up in the coolness of dining at restaurants that aren't national chains, and I forget that sometimes the chain restaurants need some love too. Friday's is a good place. Darn good. My boyfriend and I had a late dinner here after he got out of work and I got out of a late class. Not many options are out there for late night eating during the week. I had the bourbon Mahi Mahi with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The fish was very tasty and cooked well. The sides were hot and flavorful and my tummy was happy. My boyfriend had a steak with the same sides and he was pleased as well. We left and the next morning my boyfriend realized he didn't have his debit card so he called and they confirmed they were holding it for him. They made sure it was his before handing it over.

Ingrid L.,"Willis, TX",32,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,My family used to eat at Friday's quite frequently but it had been some years since we had been. I was highly disappointed. The potato skins tasted like they had instant potatoes in them. The chicken wings were the size of nuggets and about on the same caliber of McDonald's. I had French Dip which had a thin layer of roast beef.  Three of our meals were delivered to the table and I waited for mine for quite some time and this was not a busy time.
