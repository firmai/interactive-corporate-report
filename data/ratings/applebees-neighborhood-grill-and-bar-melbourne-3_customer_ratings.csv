14,Jeni S.,"Sun City, Menifee, CA",6,6,,1.0,2012-09-29,This was my first visit as I am from California.  My BFF and I were there celebrating her Birthday.  First the serves was very slow the food was not very good our order was wrong we asked for butter on our baked potato and it was dry when they finally brought the butter our food was cold and the butter was hard and frozen.  I had ordered the riblet platter  and they gave me the basket.  I also heard and saw the employees playing around in the kitchen.  Not a place I would recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956
11,Crystal B.,"Wilson, NC",83,2,2.0,1.0,2013-06-27,"If I could give this establishment half a star I would. We waited roughly 10-15 mins before our waiter showed up to take our drink order. There were four of us. My bf, his mother, our son and myself. I got my apple sangria before my son received his apple tree juice box.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer, on the menu it says it also comes with a chipotle salsa, when we asked where it was our wait was amazed it was on the menu Witt he artichoke dip and said he would talk to his manager. We never saw the salsa.  We all ordered our dinners and proceeded to wait for our food. Our waiter came by about 30ish mins after we ordered and was surprised we hadn't been served our food yet. (He was our waiter...why would anyone else serve us our food when we were his table?!?!)  So 15 mins after that he came with our food. My bf ordered the Signature sirloin w/Garlic Herb Shrimp. He got a 7 oz oddly shaped piece of steak with pilaf rice. We asked where the shrimp was and he said that it wasn't what we ordered, but if we'd like shrimp he could order it from the kitchen. We told him never mind and proceeded to start eating. When I finally focused on my meal, I ordered the take two seasonal menu: 4oz Blackened Sirloin and Garlic Rosemary Chicken Pasta. The Sirloin wasn't bad, the roasted potatoes on the other hand were over cooked and splattered with some odd paste. The Garlic Rosemary Chicken Pasta...PASS!!! Did not taste a bit like Garlic or Rosemary...it was dried chicken, a few lemon tasting artichokes and two very small pieces of portobello mushroom on drained, barely cooked correctly pasta. Pasta that was mostly stuck to itself.  When the manager came around and asked how our meal was I said it was ok...she wanted to know what was just ok. I explained my meal...which by the way also came without my bread that the menu said was included. She did comp me my meal and offered free desert...we didn't want to order any desert and then become disappointed with that.  Our waiter brought us our receipt and also proceeded to chastise us about coming to him if there were any issues with our meal. We grudgingly gave him a tip...mostly because I was once a waiter and know that you mostly live off your tips. I did want to pull him aside and explain if he would have corrected his first two mistakes (salsa with dip and missing shrimp) we wouldn't have complained to his manager about my meal...but whatever. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

26,Kayla B.,"Ames, IA",54,469,2509.0,2.0,2015-11-27,"This was an interesting Applebees experience. I really enjoy Applebees purely for the fact that the food is usually pretty standard and unvaried. I don't worry about the recipe tasting different from location to location. Unfortunately, today's experience didn't meet that expectation. I think this is the first time that I've been actually and genuinely disappointed in my Three-Cheese Chicken Penne pasta dish. It was extremely, extremely dry with virtually no sauce on it. The meet was burned. It was pretty bad. Sunday nights from 10pm to 2am are karaoke night. This, in itself, isn't an issue. Unfortunately, we spent the hour's time we were here listening to old country songs being sung by drunk people. Country song after country song. I'm cool with karaoke, but I just don't need quite so much country. We saw our server twice. On the bright side, the other staff made up for it. It's sorta like we were being waited on by the entire staff of the restaurant. We interacted with 5 different people during our stay - people checking in for drinks, or taking orders, or bringing checks. It was neat because otherwise I think we wouldn't have had any service, but it was frustrating because we had to keep repeating or clarifying what had already been done. It's an Applebees, but it's not nearly what I normally expect from my Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

Shortly afterward the bartender (a muscular bald guy who will remain nameless) hurried over and we ordered two waters. To which he replied ""jeez the last three tables ordered water"" and ran off to retrieve them. Sorry for ordering water I guess. He was rushing around and every time he came to our table he acted like we were interrupting. We both ordered the triple bacon cheeseburger which were delicious but the bartender said they all came with lettuce and tomato which they did not. His overall attitude was abrupt and inconvenienced which made our experience slightly uncomfortable. Like I said the burgers were great but we spent $24.99 on 2 bacon burgers and fries. (Onion rings substituted for $1.49). Not including tip. And you wonder why we ordered water? Lucky for him I was generous and left a $5 tip anyway.

I ordered the grill-seared watermelon with shrimp salad and ON THE MENU IT TELLS YOU WHAT DRINK PAIRS WELL.... So, I ordered it too! The drink order was so frustrating I literally almost left. I noticed that the bartender (female) was not making drinks for the servers - just standing there helping the 2 patrons sitting at the bar. So, I remind my server (again) that I STILL haven't gotten my drink and AGAIN when my food arrived and AGAIN when I was almost finished with my food. She finally admitted that the bartender didn't know how to make it and they were looking for the recipe book - really? Because I looked over and she was not looking for any recipe book. FINALLY my server went over and the two of them were trying to figure out how to make my drink. My friend ordered the Triple Hog sandwich and fries... easy enough BUT, he never got his fries. He mentioned it and she said ""they were not to my liking so I had them remake them"" FINALLY, he is almost done with his sandwich and a small bowl of fries is dropped off. About 5 minutes later ANOTHER ""server"" (manager I think?) brings a bowl of fries with twice as many as what he actually got... she sees he has french fries so she takes the bigger bowl away.  We are now BOTH annoyed and we just wanted to leave so we asked for our check and of course THAT comes quickly. ZERO discount for giving us our drink and french fries when we were almost done with our food.

I asked did it come with rolls and she said no but would find out if I could have some and she did bring 2 out. When we got the bill I noticed that the 2 ice teas were $2.59 each and I was charged $1.00 for the rolls. I think the dinner should have come with a drink unless you were getting a drink with alcohol in it and really, charging for 2 rolls?

19,Jan-Michael T.,"Palm Bay, FL",47,104,895.0,2.0,2017-02-27,"Long ago in a time not so far away during a time way before Yelp reviews, Applebee's used to have a menu that was delicious. I would frequent my local restaurant because everything they had was delicious. Oh how I wish those days would return. Until then, I will grace them with my disdain in this review. The location found guilty of serving my friends and I abominations of food is located in Eau Gallie, the southwest quadrant of the Eau Gallie Boulevard and Wickham Road intersection. If it helps, it is right in front of a shopping strip consisting of an Old Time Pottery, Tijuana Flats, Moon's Seafood, and Anytime Fitness. First and foremost, I will say the decor and style of Applebee's is dated, but nothing horrendous. It hasn't improved in like over a decade, but to be frank, it doesn't need to. Where Applebee's needs a shot of adrenaline in hopes of resuscitation is their menu. With the rise of fast casual restaurants like Chipotle's and Panera Bread Company, traditional sit-down restaurants started to suffer. In order to keep up with these new millennial-fueled establishments, said traditional sit-down restaurants did everything they could to get butts in their chairs including theme nights and revamping their menu. Applebee's changed the menu but it wasn't a revamp. For example, they have a chicken and macaroni and cheese plate. The combination usually works as proven by Wawa, but Applebee's tried to be unique by mixing traditional american cheese macaroni and topping it off with sweet and sour chicken. the combo does not fit. Let's not get started on the cooking staff. I am not attacking their character for they may be good people in life, but the food they prepare is atrocious especially when food is not cooked to order. Even when food is cooked right to the recipe, they are getting the blunt or rejection because the recipe is a disaster. As for the host and wait staff, I feel really sorry for them because many are real nice and accommodating, but they can only push such food to an extent. Ultimately, my advice is to avoid Applebee's as much as you can. There are other sit-down traditional restaurants that are doing a better job keeping up with the fast casual restaurants (like Chili's and Carrabba's Italian Grill). Let's hope that Applebee's can save itself before it becomes a figment of people's memories like Bennigan's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3,,,,,

The order had regular fries,no onion rings, a wasted $1.49. The chicken salad was grilled instead of fried and the burger was missing the tomatoes and pickles added to the detailed takeout menu.

Once we realized he wasn't goin to check on us, we got his attention as he walked by & still couldn't put our order in (at that time). Once he came back we got the check & left. Our experience on X-mas eve was completely different. I will only sit at the bar with Jeffery waiting on me from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
