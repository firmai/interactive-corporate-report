I'm  so upset by the service I've received from this Apple bees. This is not the first time but is the worst time. My order was extremely late, my burger was not made as I requested, my fries were stale and cold and the extras I paid for were forgotten. This was a take out order so after all the other mistakes I came home to realize my extras that I paid for had been forgotten. I did ask to speak to the manager when I was there but was told I would have to wait around 20minutes. Don't waste your money or time here.

When I first came to this location with my best friend, we got set immediately but we waited for at least 20mins for someone to greet us. There were at least 6 servers and 1 bartender. It wasn't even busy. I was ready to walk out. But then 20mins later, the bartender came up to us and greeted us. No apologies for waiting so long... Anyways, I ordered unsweet tea. Then she came out with sweet tea. My friend and I both ordered medium rare steak. It came out well done. She took it back. I'm a server myself and I know it's not her fault that the steak came out wrong. Overall, I was very disappointed. Waited 20mins till someone greeted us, got my drink order wrong, and steak was over cooked when asked to have it medium rare.

Chris B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",23,4,3,2.0,2/5/2016,"Just went there tonight with a couple of friends and we were actually very surprised that there was a ""VJ"" from 93.3 there. It wasn't a pleasant surprise, but it's not the fault of the store that we didn't enjoy it. However, it is very odd to have any form of loud music in such a closed space. I suppose it creates more of a bar experience to bring in a younger crowd, being so close to the university. Above all else, my main complaints are about the food. How much can I expect from an Applebee's? How much can I expect from a Chili's or a TGI Friday's in general? As these restaurants all share the same characteristics in terms of quality and variety, I normally group these together. Come to think of it, I've never once thought to myself, ""Man, am I really craving [blank] from Applebee's,"" or ever thought about recommending it. Not only was the food lackluster, it was straight bad. The wings that I ordered had a decent at best honey barbecue glaze, but the main problem was that it tasted like it was mostly breading. Like they had retrieved old bones from the trash, breaded it again, and fried and glazed them. There was hardly any meat. The fries that my friend got with his burger had obviously been sitting out for awhile because they were lukewarm, dry, and chewy. Everything is really expensive considering the quality that you receive for your dollar. I'm not sure if it's the recipes that Applebee's provides or the management that makes it this way, but I am appalled that anyone with a sense of taste can enjoy a meal there. Perhaps they were busy, perhaps they were short staffed. I won't be returning to investigate any further. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.  The only thing they got right was the draft Yuengling. But even then, at 2 for 1, the beer was still about $6, which must have incredible margins seeing as how there's a factory just a few miles out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14

Jazmine O.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,4.0,4/21/2016,"Good place to go. They are always busy so I can't complain about waiting. Some of the servers are better than others. I like that they have a VJ but the speakers are right at some of the booths and it prevents you from having a decent conversation. Food portions are sometimes off depending on who is cooking but I've never had any terrible experience. Like I said, this place is right near USF so if there is a wait, I know I will be waiting. That's just life.  As far as food goes, the Quesadilla burger is not worth it. They got rid of a lot of their half priced apps, but replaced it with some other menu that's pretty decent in prices and offerings.

The menu is so average and stale. They try to kick it up with fresh sounding ingredients but it falls short of hitting the mark. I had the quesadilla burger which was seated nicely with a crust but extremely greasy. The mac n cheese was exactly what they said it was, Kraft from the box. Truth in advertising. It's serviceable food but $53 for 4 of us to eat an average lunch is unacceptable. Lower your prices to meet the level of food you serve. $12 for a Drama burger? Yes. $12 for Crapplebees burger?

A H.,"Tampa, FL",0,8,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I used to visit this Applebees on a weekly basis during my college years. I can't say that I was picky about my food during that time. I would get one of the appetizers and a drink and call it a day. Seemed good to me during that time. However, during my most recent visits, I realized that the quality of Applebees consisting of the service and the food has significantly decreased. For example, I decided to treat my mother to Applebees during the 6:00 p.m. dinner service. We were promptly seated. Looking around the area in which my mother and I were sitting in, which consisted of about 6 tables there were napkins, crayons, silverware, crumbs, and bite size pieces of food all over the floor. It certainly was not busy considering that only two tables were occupied in my section. The party directly across from me ordered hot water and soaked their silverware in it. This is just to give you an idea of how dirty the area was.  I ordered the mild boneless chicken wings as an appetizer. I don't understand how something could have looked so unappetizing. I understand that chicken wings are just glorified chicken nuggets, but all the cooks did is cook a bunch of small boneless chicken wing pieces and tossed them in the sauce. I also ordered the Signature Sirloin w/ Garlic Herb Shrimp. I couldn't even finish the entire meal. The cheese on top of the sirloin was so overpowering. It ruined the flavor of the steak and looked really gross. My mother ordered the double crunch shrimp. It seemed to be the only appealing thing that we ordered, so I just ate some of her food. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14?start=20

My husband had a steak, mashed potatoes and corn.  He said the steak was good.  The corn tasted like it had been in a pot of hot water all day.  The potatoes were dry and stale...definitely from a box.  My husband said it was the worst mashed potatoes he'd ever had.  For the price, it should have been a lot better.   I had pot stickers and chicken casadillas.   They were pretty good.

But their happy hour specials are super cheap, so they avoid the dreaded one star at least from me. Everything you'll order, including the steaks, tastes like it's fresh out of the microwave. Your vegetables will be more limp than Hugh Hefner without Viagra. I haven't ever had anything there that wasn't bland or had any flavor. Even the spicy chicken pasta leans more heavily on just a spicy seasoning to make it seem like it has more depth than salt, but it fails terribly. What makes this location so bad is the service. I've been sitting at the bar and unable to pay my check for 10 minutes. Plus the side tables around the main bar area are very hit and miss. Sometimes you get a good server that's friendly and attentive, but too often it's someone that has too many tables (remember that's not their fault, that falls to management) or a kid that could have been cast in the movie Waiting.

David B.,"Tampa, FL",8,54,12,5.0,6/22/2011,"Even though this place Is always packed at night. I feel they are very efficient in their service and work ethic. I always come into the restaurant with over 8 people. But even though the wait is always 30+min, it's well worth it!  I give it 5 stars because for the amount of people this place sees after 10pm, they are very good with customer service and getting people their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14?start=40
Ray C.,"Denver, CO",25,190,113,3.0,10/30/2012,"My friend and I went out to this Applebees restaurant. It was just OK because of the chicken I got on my Oriental Chicken salad was cold. My friend got his chicken tenders and fries. His fries was horrible because of TOO MUCH salt and seasonal and he requested for a replacement of his fries and it was better.  We learned that it depends on the cookers who made our dinner. Our server was just OK.    I would grade this restaurant  a ""C"" .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14?start=40

Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3386,793,1522,4.0,4/16/2009,We usually hit Applebee's up for their appetizer special after 10PM. Half-priced appetizers is an awesome deal that we take of advantage of all the time. Waitresses and waiters seem slightly annoyed by the college crowd but are still pretty friendly. I like to order nachos as my meal normally and karaoke nights are awesome as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tampa-14?start=40
