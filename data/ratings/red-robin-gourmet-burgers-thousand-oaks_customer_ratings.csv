Our waitress was very friendly!  We had a decent size group so I applaud her for accommodating us (well they would have to anyways).  The food was good, for the type of place Red Robin is.  I ordered the Southwest Pasta and it was just the right amount of spicy.  The options aren't as healthy as I would have liked, but its a burger joint, so that was expected.

We were not greeted and when we were sat there was not even a smile on the girls face. The bartender was our server and there weren't many people in the bar area, but our service was lacking! Took forever to get iced teas and refills throughout our meal. There was a new person each time we needed something. We both ordered the bbq chicken wrap and soup combo and when our food should have arrived, we were approached by yet another person to tell us they were out of tortilla soup....VERY DISAPPOINTING! We should have been told when we ordered or JUST AFTER we ordered, not 15 minutes later. And the bartender/our server told us straight up he didn't want to deliver the bad news so he sent someone else out!...WTF?! I opted for a salad instead and before I could ask what dressings they had, the guy walked away!... I wanted to just leave at this point, but then another staff member brought out our food, without asking if we needed anything. I needed salad dressing! It took another 5 minutes before anyone else came over and then another 5 minutes to get the dressing.... The wrap was terrible and the balsamic dressing was too bitter. My dates fries were stale....even the iced tea had a ""dirty"" taste. I even asked for no tortilla strips on my wrap and the dressing on the side...guess what? It was made as they normally do and ignored my requests! I was fed up already so I just ate what I could, picking through the wrap. My date did the same as it was just bad food, bad service and an all around bad experience!

Finally the bill came and Ryan told our husband he was sorry again and that he asked the manager to take off the wings that took 30 minutes and were cold and the manager said know.

My boy and I went to this Red Robin after both not having been to a Robin in ages, expecting what normally comes from a visit to any Red Robin location -good burgers, solid service, fun atmosphere, etc.  While the atmosphere was there, everything else was dreadfully lacking.  I honestly couldn't believe our experience. First, and the biggest of complaints, was the service.  Our server seemed over-worked, like she had too many tables to attend to and that's not her fault.  She only refiled my water once and it was empty for about 70% of my time in the restaurant.   However, that's not the big whammy... When a customer orders a burger a certain way (absolutely plain) and the server forgets, the answer is never 'let's just scrape off what she didn't want on it,' which is exactly what happened.  The burger returned to my table after I sent it back wet in sauces I had previously asked to be removed, with small pieces of lettuce and tomato still remaining.  What's worse... I could actually see missing scrapes of bread where they tried to remove condiments and add-ons with a knife.  Ew.  Seriously, worst experience.  Honestly, if I was allergic, think of the consequences.  Absolutely poor service... a huge lawsuit waiting to happen.  Step it up, Red Robin.   Secondly, something was even up with my boyfriend's burger that night.  Super salty and in a bad way.  He's a salt lover and even he couldn't take it.  (Note:  He has eaten that same burger before at a different Red Robin location.  Huh... food for thought.) Anyway, I will not be returning to that Red Robin.  Who knows what I'll find in my burger next time.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.6600000000000006,3.2800000000000002

By the time my friend's burger arrived, I was almost finished eating and there was only a mumbled apology from the waiter - he said the kitchen must have missed the order. When a similar thing has happened in other restaurants, they often offer to comp a part of the meal, or even a drink to make up for their error - no such offer here. The price of over $15.00 for an iced tea and a burger with a small portion of sweet potato fries (not 'endless' fries, at least we were not offered any more) is definitely not worth it - I don't plan on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.372,3.3200000000000003

126,Ari M.,"Oak Park, CA",0,34,6.0,3.0,2014-06-14,"Red Robin is definitely one of my favorite places.  Went here last night (Friday) with a friend to celebrate my birthday - which was the previous day. Anyway, apparently a lot of dads wanted their hamburgers and to watch the Kings win; it was pretty packed. Only a couple of 2 person booths were empty. A lot of smaller tables had been put together for groups of over 6. But I digress. This is an awesome place. Usually I have no problems with food/service/etc. Yesterday, though, our fried zucchini (which I am obsessed with), was haphazardly cooked. My friend split a piece in half and we saw that there was flour and uncooked egg/flour mix against the zucchini. Was also a bit harder to bite into than I'm used to.  Now, I appreciate their attempts to move forward in the technological world. What I don't like is them appearing like Stacked. That place is ok, but over-priced. I liked the original Red Robin, where waiters and waitresses take the orders so the food can be customized and quesitons can be asked. That's what tips are for. Not them dropping off the food. The ordering pad was a sticky mess that we couldn't navigate because they were so busy we didn't get a waitress to show us how it works, so we kept having to press the ""call server"" button. Also - we had.... 3 waitresses. It was frustrating. They were nice, but it drove us crazy. That's how busy it was. I'm just venting though. Usually everything is great. Apparently it's best to ignore holiday weekends completely.  Quick menu synopsis: Hamburgers = awesome! They don't mess up on how to cook the meat. Soups = soupy goodness! Bottomless anything = bang for your buck! (Just make sure to press the ""call server"" button) Shakes & malts = cold deliciousness! Strawberry lemonade = childhood summertime memories! Cod filet (fish & chips) = I ordered this yesterday. Normally cooked to perfection. They had the same smidge of a problem as the zucchini. They're forgiven since it's still fresh and tasty. Overall, still go, don't take to heart the 3-star rating. Make sure to beat the peak-hours. Early birds for happy hour and elders before 7, cocktail times, or early lunchers.

Two pieces of shriveled parsley, no garlic, a few slivers of parm, no oil and TONS of salt. Our burgers were delivered with none of the sides. When we reminded the meal deliverer (who was not the waiter), she brought them all on the same plate and also  someone I assumed was the manager. I told her both burgers were overcooked and she did her best to convince me there WAS some pink in there (somewhere). She did offer to re fire the burgers and bring new fries, but we were too hungry and (fortunately) had a gift certificate, so we weren't ""technically"" paying for the meal. Thankfully...or it ALL would have gone back to the kitchen. I have never written a review but felt compelled. The bill was just shy of $26.00 and NOTHING was correct with the order. I told the manager that  The Habit did a better job...she seemed surprised. After reading some of these other reviews, I don't think she should have been.  C'mon...how difficult is it to make a decent burger and fries...cheech!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.212,3.0400000000000005

I spoke to Sarah the manager on duty and she handed me menus and said to decide what we want and she will put the order in so the food would come fast and she would get us a seat all together which she did in a timely fashion..still worried about not having enough time to eat and make the movie we decided to trust Sarah and I am glad we did.

They have a good fry seasoning too. Very kid friendly and good vibe for a family meal.  The bad: Burgers are really not special. They got rid of the salmon.  This location: I grew up with RR in a different town and have been to many locations. So far this location had the worst service. There was no wait to be seated but it took a  long time to order and receive the food. The food was not hot upon arrival (probably sat for a while before delivery to the table). I asked for BBQ sauce and then didn't see the waitress for 15min. It took a long time to get the check- basically everything took twice as long as at any other RR.

Tonight I had the new ghost pepper burger with raw and fried jalepenos. Of course I had them add an egg (1.49 extra) and I requested two sample size servings of their premium dipping sauces (otherwise 75 cents each.) The chipotle sauce was okay and the sweet and spicy thai was a little better but nothing to write home (or yelp) about. Now it appeared to me that most, if not all, of the burgers came in two sizes, either a double...which you think would be the bigger of the two but isn't (it's two small kids size patties) or the big burger...which is a single thick patty (for $2 more.) Not wanting to over eat, I went with the ""double"" and it was plenty. Only drawback is you can't order your patty medium rare (or whatever you like) since the patties aren't thick enough. Service was very friendly and the kids were happy so hey, it was a win. Only real disappointment was the $5 dinner salad, which was about half the size of a Habit salad for the same price. They were also out of hard boiled eggs for my wife's Cobb salad, which was interesting since I was able to get a fried one on my salad (I'm guessing prepackaged for quality control.)

103,Michael S.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,78,,1.0,2015-10-11,"""Their Gourmet Burgers weren't ...& the service was Worse!"" Red Robin claims they are making ""Gourmet Burgers"" and at upwards of $15. bucks each (for some) they should be! 4 of us went for an early Saturday Dinner. My friend & I ordered the Burgers, my wife a wrap & his wife a large fancy salad.  Being 4:30 and not jammed yet there shouldn't have been any service problems but.... After ordering, the waiter told our friend they didn't have any hard boiled eggs (?) for the salad would she like to substitute avocado... she said yes. We sat & talked for awhile when we realized it was about 20 minutes and no food yet then the waiter finally stopped by and said ""Coming up soon"".  Finally the food came.  My wife said her wrap was OK.  My ""Gourmet Burger"" looked O.K. but when I bit into it the Onion Bun tasted like it had just come out of the fridge...it wasn't toasted or heated at all...the meat was NOT handmade gourmet but seemed to be a frozen patty and it was tepid, not hot... AND the ""Bottomless Fries"" were ice cold. My friend said his Burger was the same.  I assumed the food had been sitting for awhile before it had been delivered.  I flagged down the waiter and told him about the Cold Fries he said..""...oh they're a little cold?""...I said ""NO they're ice cold""...he said ""No Problem & off he went"". Awhile later the waiter brought a plate of Hot Fries. Then our friends wife said ""they didn't add the extra avocado she was supposed to get""? The waiter said ""No Problem""... off he went for another 15 minutes...then out came two slivers of avocado...Our friend asked for more Bottomless Fries...""No Problem""...the waiter said then disappeared forever. About 15 minutes later a girl walks up and says ""I'm you're new waiter can I help you""...we said we were still waiting for our ""Bottomless"" Fries...she brought them immediately.

This location, however, has gone down hill since its recent renovation. I'm pretty sure they must have changed management because my gripe isn't with a particular server or host, it's with the overall service of the entire staff which is almost always a reflection of management. First, when I entered the restaurant the hostess just stood there until I asked for a table, no ""hi welcome to red robin or at least ""welcome"", just a blank stare.  Second, it took 15 minutes to get someone to take our drink order. Third, they forgot to bring out the appetizer and decided to just deliver it AFTER our main entrees arrived. Um, by that point an appetizer is pointless. Fourth, the bartender slid my beer down on our table and  just walked away. Not that big a deal, but maybe a ""here is your beer"" would be a little better approach rather than acting like it was a chore to bring my $7 beer.  Fifth, it took 10 minutes after we said we were done to finally get our check. Considering we had already been there for over an hour because the food took so long to get to our table, our kids were antsy, and it wasn't a busy night! It took so long my wife had to leave with the kids before I could even pay.  Our last visit was the final straw. We've noticed a change over the last few months in the declining level of service but decided to brush it off each time. Not anymore though... Until this location changes the way in which they treat their customers we won't be back.

But, about half way through It I realized it was the wrong kind of wrap.  At this point I don't care because I am starving and don't want to risk another 50 min wait.  For dessert, I got to watch the guy at the end of the bar brush his teeth( yes I did write at the end of the bar) spit in his glass and then he finished up with MOUTH WASH.

And you know how the fry orders go...like 5 fries with your meal and you have to ask for more. So when we were done with our burgers and still waiting on my daughters broccoli, the server came to ask if we were all set. Told her we needed drink refills, broccoli, and a refresh of fries. Fries and broccoli came...no drink refills. I gave up. If you're going to try this location, do it on a slow night so that you may get some service.

At the table, nobody came even though several servers walked right past me.  I tried several times to get the bartender's attention but she didn't notice me either.  I was going to have to get up and walk over to the bar, which I did, and asked if there was a server on duty.  She was apologetic and went into the kitchen and told me someone was coming.  Nobody came even though several servers walked right past me.  Finally, a guy who just started his shift introduced himself and took my order. He checked on me occasionally and made sure my drink was topped off.  He was a good server.  He wasn't over the top, but also not a grump either.  I got a burger and 'bottomless' fries.  I don't get that concept.  Who wants to keep filling themselves up with french fries?  The burger came out surprisingly fast and then I understood the 'bottomless fries' concept.  You're given such a small portion (maybe 8-10 fries), most people would probably keep asking for more.  I don't really like fries, so I just ate the first portion and I was content.  It's a big burger and I've got to say, it's one of the better burgers I've had in awhile.  The patty is flavorful and the toppings don't soak the roll but blend nicely together.   I hardly doubt I'll return as this is pretty far from where I live, but if you want a burger, it's a good place to drop in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks,3.4,2.79,2.79,2.316,3.034

14,Christopher D.,"Westlake Village, CA",4,19,,1.0,2017-03-14,"I'll give it 1 star for fond memories. I used to be a regular at the old Agoura location before it closed down forcing me here.  It's the mall so parking is horrible and I'd say 30% of the time, I just keep driving and find another restaurant with the wife. The last two times have pretty much diminished any desire I have to return to this location. A year or so ago, the place was upbeat, the bartenders friendly, and always on top of things. These last 3 trips have been a literal embarrassment. I stopped in for a late lunch (around 3PM) and the place was pretty much empty except for the bar area. Usually I just grab myself a seat at the bar and be on my way. No one showed up in the bar for about 10 minutes. When they finally did, I was able to at least get a appetizer and drink in. 10 min later the water comes, and maybe 10 after that the appetizer shows up. (In this time, the staff hadn't even returned to take an order. Ended up standing my menu vertically to get their attention) Asked for place settings multiple times, was never provided any until I had fully eaten. Looking around it looks like there was maybe 3 people on-staff the entire time. The cook, the manager, and maybe 1 hostess. It's been like that fairly frequently. The entire bar area was a pretty uncomfortable scene with multiple people complaining about the incredibly long waits. As I left, there was a couple arguing with the manager about the service, so I wasn't the only one. The manager didn't even really seem to care about the complaints and the answer was ""If you're hungry, you can always eat elsewhere!""  It's easier for me to cut my losses and just stop coming here. I felt like I honestly wasted my money there for sub-par food. This place also has a nasty habit of ""forgetting"" you had an appetizer/salad order and it just sits on the prep table until you either mention it or they realize it's there. Not cool for you to deliver an appetizer to a group, and then minutes later bring the entree. They say unlimited fries, which I now understand. The old Agoura location was pretty nice and would just set a basket of fries next to your entree. Here it's like they find the 9 soggiest fries they can and put it in the basket. Really... 9 fries? The last few times I felt like I needed to know ahead of time what I wanted or I'd be in for a wait.  Think I saw my server make 3 times in almost an hour. Maybe the manager changed, but boy this place is a disaster. Just save yourself the time. I can't even bring myself to go in for the free burger anymore.

But hey it's 2017, so if a restaurant is going to offer vegetarian options they should be held accountable for their taste. The Bocca Burger I ordered was one of the worst things I've ever tasted in my entire life. That is not hyperbole. It neither looked nor tasted like any Bocca Burger I've seen in person or could find online. It was more like pinkish Solyent Green. The manager replaced the Bocca Patty with their Garden Burger ... it was also unlike any Garden Burger I've  ever seen! Both were soggy, mushy, textureless and flavorless. The manager confirmed that both are MICROWAVED. I politely explained that I don't see the point of indulging in a restaurant meal to get microwaved frozen food. She vehemently insisted they were both ""quite popular""...which I highly doubt. She took the Bocca burger off the bill...but that's not really the point. An evening out - even at Red Robin - should be a treat, not mushy microwaved food that you could prepare better at home. Although it's convenient, I won't be back to this RR. I'll be at Habit Burger where they know how to make a veggie burger without a microwave.

Parking for any of the restaurants in this location is the worst, but that's not the reason for the low rating.   The main reason is for their prices.  $9 for an order of onion rings?!?!?  REALLY?!?!?  Ok, I got over that thinking of the big bowl of clam chowder soup that was coming.  Or was it?  We were told by 3 different people that they ""had to make a new batch and it would be a few minutes until it was ready"".  Okay.  20 minutes went by and still no soup.  By now, the onion rings were gone and we were still waiting.  Finally, the server brings us our bowls (not cups) of soup.  We both stared at each other as we could not believe this small thing was the BOWL size!  No kidding, the BOWL was really a 4 inch by 4 inch SQUARE.  We laughed just thinking if this was the bigger size, what does the cup size look like?  So we ate our ""freshly made"" soup and laughed at how many undercooked pieces of potato were in it.  Overall, not a good experience, once again, and much too pricey for what we ordered.  Our bill was a little over $30 for an order of onion rings, 2 bowls of soup, 1 coke, and 1 soda water.   As we attempted to pay the bill on the electronic pad at the table, I noticed I was charged $2.99 for my soda water.  I've ordered soda water in restaurants my entire life and I have never been charged for it.  Anywhere.  No lie.  I asked our server if it was a mistake on the bill, and after getting an apology, I was told that charging for soda water was something they ""recently started doing"".  That pretty much ended it for me right there for good.  Not ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=20,2.52,2.69,2.69,,2.622

We had requested that.   It helped us have an enjoyable lunch.  I got the Southern burger which was excellent.  My got the Black and Blue burger.  We both really liked the onion rings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=20,2.64,2.72,2.72,,2.688

13,Peter C.,"Upper Darby, PA",93,1,,1.0,2017-08-27,"I was just accused and lectured by the manager of this establishment about underage drinking after they saw my wife drinking my alcoholic drink. I guess our server Chloe didn't even have the courage just to ask my wife for ID, instead our server straight up escalated it to the manager who immediately approached us like we were criminals of sort. There was not even a polite request for her ID. We immediately even offered to show our ID as well and went to obtain the ID to prove that we were over 21 without further causing a scene like the manager was in front of everyone. Even after the incident, there wasn't any apology at all from either Chloe or the manager.  They even seemed to purposely left our order hanging for more than 45 minutes and never came by once to tell us about our order while the other groups around us received their order.  Definitely a horrible experience with the manager and the server of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks,2.64,2.72,2.72,,2.688
32,Courtney M.,"Moorpark, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-09-01,"Went here last night (August 31). Awful service. We were sat right away but the chair was wet. I literally wiped the wet seat with my sleeve before sitting down right in few of the hostess. The table was so sticky, honestly really disgusting. We sat there for about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our server. She took our drink and app order and it took another 10 minutes to get our waters and our appetizer never came. We called our server over and ordered our burgers. It took 40 MINUTES for our food to come. It was 7:45pm on a Thursday night. There were only a few other tables. Pretty dead. We also watched our server put a beer down in front of a likely underage gentlemen at the table next to us and then AFTER he took a sip she asked ""You're 21 right?"". We were floored. Our server also touched our fries with her bare hands right on the line. EW. I've worked in a restaurant for close to 4 years and have held a Food Handlers Card the entire duration. You are NOT suppose to touch food with your bare hands. Anyways... we got our food, it was mediocre. I would have spoke to a manager but it was hard enough to wrangle a refill so we just payed and left. Thank god for the at table payment system because we probably would have been there until 11pm if we had to wait for our server. I like Red Robin but it was very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=20,2.52,2.68,2.68,,2.616

Got the order completely wrong (ordered it with no mayo as I'm allergic), brought it back a second time and I'm convinced they just microwaved the burger and put it on a new bun because it was dry as hell. Asked for a knife and was handed a plastic one in a bag, was told it was because they were out of clean silverware. Never got a refill on my soda even after I asked her in twice in passing. Oh! and to top it off it was my daughters birthday (she was even wearing a pink headband that says ""Happy Birthday""). I also mentioned it to her right when we sat down so that they could come sing for her. Ordered a few sundaes for the kids including the Birthday Girl. Never did she/they come sing Happy Birthday and of course she charges me for my daughter's complimentary sundae. Love Red Robin in general but I would steer clear of the one at the Thousand Oaks Mall.

I don't expect greatness when I go into a burger chain but often they make up for it with their service. I have to say, Red Robin's service is mediocre, at best.

0,Pete D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,29,,3.0,2017-12-02,"I've eaten at this location a few times and unfortunately it has gone downhill.  Service: It seems this is a roll of the dice. Some report good service, others say service was terrible. We had a server that was either inexperienced or didn't care. We ordered 3 drinks and she brought them out individually over a span of 15 mins?! When she took our order she didn't mention any of the specials, but did try to up-sell us. She came by once to check on us, but by that time we were almost done eating. I was cautious about touching the iPad device on the table, who knows how often they clean them? Prices: I noticed the prices went up since my last visit which isn't too surprising. The issue is they're at a price point that it's not worth it to go there. For $12 I expect a large gourmet burger and a heap of fries, which I didn't get. For half the price I can get a top burger at Carl's. I also ordered a draft beer which cost $5.40 for the 16oz, (WTF?)! I guess this is to off-set the happy hour prices? Never again.. Food: in a nutshell it is a poor value. I ordered the Boss Hog burger and of course didn't look anything like the picture. It was suppose to be pulled pork atop a beef patty, instead it was a few slivers of pork, I really had to look for it. The bottomless fries only works if you have an attentive waitress, which we didn't.  Fortunately we have a lot choices in T.O. when comes to restaurants.

Of all the Red Robins this is the only one in Ventura County that seats based on age group (21+, teens, and kiddies) which I think is a great idea!! If you don't have children typically, you don't want to sit around a bunch of screaming kids. I speak for all the RR with the next few comments..It would be cool if they brought out fresh fries from the beginning not when you ask for a refill. Other than that, service is usually slow.

4,Joe B.,"Goshen, KY",4,3,,2.0,2018-01-13,"One of my favorite casual burger spots - great variety of burgers including price ranges, really good salads, sandwiches are great, and pretty good entrées. They are usually pretty crowded due to popularity so easier to just order take out - have been doing do for the past few years. Really good website ordering so you can customize to the Nth degree if you want. Relocated to a new area 4 mos ago and tonight was our 5th attempt at ordering to go. As usual, the website was perfect - it remembered our location of choice and was easy to log on to our loyalty account. As usual, finished the order and got the confirmation saying my order would be ready at 7:59pm. As usual,  I arrived on time to check in at the time the current confirmation told me to. As usual, the hostess told me they were working on my order. At 8:10pm I asked the hostess if she could check on my order since I could see a few to go orders being packed from where I was standing  and saw one of the bags get moved to a heat lamp. The hostess never came back. At 8:14pm a young man came to deliver a to go order but the customer had left for a moment. He saw me watching and asked if I was waiting for an order - I said yes and gave my wife's name- he said that my order was ready except for my drink (my order was the one on the heat lamp and had been there for about 5 min before I was told it was ready). He came back with my drink immediately and started to verify my order. I noticed there was no teriyaki sauce and no garlic bread - which is the norm for this location to forget. As he went to retrieve the missing items, I tasted one of the French fries and noticed that it was cold. Its 8:20 now and family expecting food so I didn't make the Temps an issue. Got home and salads on came with 1 mini cup of dressing and no breads sticks for the kids meal and the fruit was shabby at best. Been a fan for many years but this location is a no-go for me going forward. I hope this gets read by management there cause I can't get their attention while I'm in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks,2.4,2.7,2.7,,2.58
