32,J W.,"Springfield, MO",0,15,16.0,4.0,2012-02-14,"I really enjoy this place, but I have to say I hate going here with my children!! I feel that the environment is too loud for little kids, and the space the tables are in is too small ( it feels like you are really in the way with a high chair).  However, these are really not things Friday's themselves can change, just more heads up type of situation. I would have gave them five stars, but one time this one waitress added $10 to the tip I gave her. And a very small vegetarian selection!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
21,Cassie R.,"Springfield, MO",0,8,,2.0,2012-12-17,"They have some GREAT dishes and their 2 for $20 or 2 for $15 menus are a great value.. portions are ginormous!  I do have one beef that has really made me iffy to return. The last time we were there, we sat near the bar. I saw a bartender drinking some sort of slushie from a cup as she was kind of hidden by the door. Most customers probably couldn't have seen her. As she was finishing the slushie she was reaching her finders in and licking and sucking the drink off her fingers. It was enough to make me want to barf. BUT THEN, without washing her hands, I witnessed her  reach into a container of lemons (with her nasty spit covered hand) and garnish several drinks. I immediately asked the hostess to speak to a manager and she looked terrified. Mind you, I am not a confrontational person and did not go at this angry, just concerned. I let the manager know and it really seemed like his main concern was to just get me us out the door. He never even asked which bartender it was.  I'm not sure if I will go back, but if I do I sure wont be ordering any drinks and I urge you to do the same!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
30,Mark K.,"Springfield, MO",18,15,,1.0,2013-01-04,"First off, the day we went the place wasn't even busy and we get seated right next to a bunch of annoying teenie-boppers who are loud as can be (keep in mind there were many other seats the hostess could've sat us), took about 20 min to get a drink order, when the meals were finally brought out another 20-30 min later, the chicken was as dry as a hockey-puck and the shrimp pasta tasted like someone stomped on it with dirty shoes because it was rubbery and bland, will NEVER be going back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

My favorite is the jack Daniels flat iron steak. Better than a ribeye at Colton's which isn't saying much but it's good and comes with cornbread and 2 sides for 13 bucks! I'd give this place 5 stars if it had free munchies like peanuts or bread but I'll be back for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384
18,Molly R.,"Springfield, MO",117,121,166.0,1.0,2013-12-16,"Ah, yes. I remember now why I don't ever eat here. Although TGI Friday's was a favorite of mine as a kid, I've since wised up to the fact that there's nothing particularly special or worthwhile about this chain restaurant. Eating local didn't make it into the finals for my friends' dining selection last night, but alas... TGIF's did. First of all, my jaw dropped when I saw the prices. Eight bucks for appetizers? Twelve PLUS bucks for a burger? Yeah, right. There's a definite disconnect between quality, portion and price. But, it couldn't be helped - I settled for ordering one tiny plate of the ahi tuna ""Taste and Share"" items. It was mediocre: although the tuna was seared well, it was completely tasteless, which caused the accompanying wasabi sauce to overpower it completely as opposed to complimenting its mildness. The rest of the dish - guacamole, dots of Sriracha and jalapenos - was unnecessary. Too many competing, crazy powerful flavors piled on top of a very bland version of something I covet. Booooo. It's worth mentioning that a few of my friends had brought along a coupon and getting it processed took ages. Our waitress was apologetic about it, but told us that the manager would have to process it and that he/she was occupied - hence the extra 10 minute+ wait. It was a routine, simple coupon, so I have to admit that was a turn-off as well. Hi ho, hi ho - away from chains I go. UPDATE: Since writing this review, I had a few hours of being super ill, which I traced back to the tuna. Demoted to one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield,,,,,
25,Lucas L.,"Springfield, MO",5,83,13.0,5.0,2014-01-17,Really had a great meal here. Our waiter was fantastic I think his name was Jesse. Some of the best service I've ever had. Me my wife and two kids went and had a nice time. I had the jack Daniels sampler OMG it was really good. I would recommend eating here anytime.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,,,,,
17,Scott N.,"Portland, OR",1,26,,2.0,2014-06-11,"TGI Friday's seems to have gone through the same ""Which way do we go?"" pseudo-upscale makeover as several other chain restaurants. If my visit today is any indication of their price/quality/portion combination going forward, I might not go back for a while. As lunch drew near this morning, I had a craving for an Americanized quesadilla, so I headed off to the nearest TGI Fridays, thinking such a thing would be in their wheelhouse. As I arrived, I noticed the decor and atmosphere had changed: more subdued, less goofiness on the wall, lower lighting, darker wood stains, more modern all the way around. Since I was a single, I was promptly shown to the bar area and given a short but slightly awkward spiel about the their new menu and how it featured fresher ingredients than their previous one. As other reviewers have noted, the prices have gone up significantly from what I remember. A basic burger is over $10, and standard sandwiches like the club are in the same range. I got some hope when I discovered a lunch menu, but while it listed some mediocre-to-decent combos for multiple people, the ones for individuals were lacking. Classic single-person discrimination. It also listed some meals at the same price as the regular menu, which isn't awful, but I think there is some expectation that a lunch menu contains lunch-specific items. The worst part: there was nary a quesadilla to be found. After taking an annoyingly long time to peruse the whole menu, I settled on a lunch-portion salad with glazed chicken and caesar vinaigrette dressing. My server immediately tried to upsell me to a full portion, claiming it was ""only about a dollar more."" It was actually about two dollars more, and I already felt I was paying too much for lunch at a casual chain restaurant, so I stayed with my original order. Foreshadowing: I kind of wish I had taken the bait. My food was delivered very promptly (in about a minute), but was a smaller portion than I thought it would be. The bowl had a wide rim, but the actual concave part was about the size of the smallest Pyrex bowl in the set I have at home. The lettuce was fresh, the chicken was tasty without being exceptional, and the caesar vinaigrette dressing was a bit tangy for my taste. The service was great; my waitress was attentive, and other than the upsell attempt, very pleasant. It probably helped I was the only person in her section for most of my meal. The check came, and the total damage for a small salad with a few bits of chicken plus tax and an average tip was almost $11. This is where people on the coasts ask what I'm complaining about. I seriously considered stopping by Subway on my walk back to the office to pick up a 6-inch sandwich, but I had taken a late lunch, so I figured I'd just wait until I got home after work. A couple hours later, I'm regretting that decision. The next time I consider going to TGI Friday's, I'll remember how it felt to sign that check and the empty feeling in my stomach right now. This specific restaurant isn't the only one wrestling with the transition to something more than a standard casual chain restaurant, but they are among the few to have a Cheddar's within viewing distance. Good luck with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield,,,,,
23,Steve W.,"Dallas, TX",0,26,1.0,2.0,2014-07-22,Slow slow slow slow.  You think the wait staff stops by to see if my drink needs refill or update  when my dinner might be here.  No.  Won't be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,,,,,

16,Caleb G.,"Augusta, KS",7,9,5.0,2.0,2014-09-09,"The service this far has been great. Food and drinks have been par for TGIF. The funny part is the have a wall the separates the bar from the general sections. Happy hour 1/2 price apps only happen on the bar side of the wall. I find this silly, but after sucking up the the manager they caved and have given us the same deal. I guess, ask and you shall receive. Apps were good!!! Everything else was a nightmare!!! If you don't like the jack suace, Don't order a steak!!! Sent back once for MW instead on MR. One it came back out it was as if there was a 30 year old grill that has never been cleaned greasing up my steak while burning the out side. Two stokes your out.  Why is it with past bad experiences, we conscience ourselves we should give it another shot.  Not again.

33,Grace M.,"Springfield, MO",0,2,,1.0,2014-12-28,"I stopped in to have lunch and was greeted and seated right away. The waiter Devon, I think was quick about coming over and getting my drink order. He was prompt about taking my food order also. My drink and food arrived in a quick fashion. And then it went downhill. It was like I was eating in a ghost town. The place was pretty empty and he and the other servers were standing behind me by the wait area talking. I heard him say something about working a split shift and he was ready to leave. I was his only table that I saw.  He brought my check over when I was about a quarter of the way done. Laid it on the table and said no hurry. Never asked how my meal was  nor did he ask if I wanted another drink. Five minutes later he comes by and picks it up. I look at him because I had food in my mouth and he said oh you arent ready yet. Still not inquiring about my food or drink. I had ordered the chicken and shrimp. Part of the chicken was still raw. I put in on the side of the plate. He never came back I just left enough to cover the bill and left. No body even said a word as I left. I was very disappointed. I have eaten at tgif's in California a lot and loved it. Not here though. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,,,,,

20,Nichol B.,"Ludowici, GA",0,26,,3.0,2016-07-23,"Recently made our first visit to TGI Fridays in Springfield and it was only somewhat above average. We were promptly seated during late dinner time and our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. They had drinks specials as usual but our waitress was unable to provide any recommendation or feedback on the drinks as she simply stated, ""sorry, I don't drink."" It is my opinion, you should at least be able to answer a couple of questions regardless of if you have personally tried any of the specials.. as a waitress, you should be knowledgeable of your specials if you have to ask the bartender ahead of time or even at the time of guest request. Aside from the drinks, our food arrived in a timely manner, was cooked well and tasted great. This TGI Fridays was similar to all others as far as the atmosphere but it wasn't as clean as it could have been (this may have also been due to post dinner rush). We may possibly return to this restaurant during another trip to Springfield but I feel we will likely try several others over choosing this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The staff were friendly and prompt, so no issues there.   I had a Caesar salad with salmon, and the salmon was over cooked.  The dressing was not a fresh concoction, and dressing coverage was poor.  My company had a naan wrap with shrimp, which was actually somewhat unwieldy and difficult to eat, but was flavorful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

9,Jeanie M.,"Springdale, AR",11,4,7.0,1.0,2017-08-13,"I would like to say first that this was our first visit ever to a TGIF. We arrived at this TGIF about 1:30pm and was seated right away. There were lots of empty tables because it was after the lunch rush. However, after we were seated and drinks orders taken we decided that my husband, and our two boys would get the unlimited apps and I was getting something else. So by then the time was 1:50 we placed our order and waited... during this time another family came in and placed their drink order and appetizers. Finally my order came and only one of our sons. Then the family that just order received their two appetizers and the apps were what we were waiting on.  At this time our sons was done with his app and we still had not received any more food. So I found a manager to her what was going on she proceeded to go to the kitchen and that is when our waitress was coming out with only one of our appetizers, just one. So at this rate we were only going to receive one app at a time with the time of 10 minutes in between each appetizer..no thank you!  Unfortunately,  my husband and I both said this is not working we would pay for what we had at this point which was only a house salad,Diet Coke, and 4 pieces of chicken. The manager was very apologetic and trying to say she would find out what was going on but at this point we were done.  The manager did say don't worry about paying for anything and we left.  As the result of this whole situation, my family was very disappointed. If you have a special make sure that orders r being filled at the same time and quickly, that just makes sense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

We decided to split a burger since it had a hefty $14 price tag and we wanted to make sure we would like it. We started with the spinach and cheese dip. It seriously seemed to be half a can of spinach, and 3 tablespoons of cheese. I also didn't care for the chips; I felt they were too hard. The burger comes out and resembles a McDonald's $1 burger. Burger, cheese, thin slice of tomato, a pickle, and tiny piece of lettuce. For $14 and being a ""veggie burger"" I expected it to be piled high with ""veggies!"" The burgers presentation was terrible to say the least.  The positive note is I am glad we tried the beyond beef burger because it tasted amazing!
