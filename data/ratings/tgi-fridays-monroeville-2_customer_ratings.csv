27,Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,527,597.0,4.0,2012-05-11,"Great food but, the service could be better. This Friday's location has been recently remodeled and updated. There is a nice outside dining area great for the warmer months. The food is always good. They offer apps, sandwiches, salads, seafood, burgers, pasta, steaks and ribs. My only complaint is that the wait for your food is ssssssssssssssssssssssllllllllllllllllllllllllllll­lllllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooo­ooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! You will need at least an hour if you come here during lunch time. The last time we went the three of us shared the pick three appetizer. We choose  Buffalo Wings, Fried Mozzarella Sticks and Potato Skins. The trios was enough food so we took our sandwiches home for lunch the next day. The wife had the Triple Reuben and I had the Jack Daniels Burger. Our daughter had her usually burger. One thing I can truly say is that their fries are something special. They are extremely addictive! Drinks consists of typical Coke products and they offer a full bar as well. All in all a solid place for when you don't fill like cooking. *Insider Tip* Be sure to sign up for a free Give Me More Strips account.

Service is always satisfactory and occasional servers who go above and beyond, such as our waiter tonight, Sarah.  I feel that the food is better on weekdays rather than on weekend because they aren't rushed and the food doesn't sit under the warmers waiting to be taken to tables.

The consistency of the chicken was rubbery, but had a bold tone of crust. The Mac and Cheese pairing was bland, but edible. (2.5/5 stars) Service- The server was nice and had a warm personality. Though, he didn't check with us throughout the meal. (Side Note- Other employees were acting inappropriate). The server was ok. (3/5 Stars) Appearance/Ambience- Good use of decor.

The outside of the building is nice, but the inside is dim and has the cluttered, nostalgic look that only works at Cracker Barrel. The potato skins that used to be epic are tiny, overcooked crisps with a nickel-size dab of ""cheese"". The wings are tasty, but so tiny you begin to worry that you were served the sickliest of chickens or the wings of a smaller fowl. The potstickers were the most disappointing appetizer: hard skin and salty, gummy, grey filling. The meats are average burgers and ribs), but it's the sauce that makes them yummy.  The service is basic, but there are a few friendly bartenders.  I won't be visiting Friday's again for a while, not until I forget or forgive my lukewarm experiences here and give them another chance to underwhelm me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

40,John H.,"Monroeville, PA",0,15,,4.0,2015-02-23,"I started going to TGI Fridays about 5 Yrs ago. I've been around the country, and the TGI's in Monroeville is the best. The staff is very friendly and the prices are on par with the typical chain restaurants. Now let's get to the important stuff, the food.  My wife and I had been looking for a place to make ""ours"" since I moved up here a few years ago. We had tried many places, but for some reason, not TGI's.  We stopped in there one afternoon at random, just because we were passing by. When  we tasted the Jack Daniel's sampler, we were in love. Lots of chicken and shrimp and ribs, an appetizer big enough for a meal (in fact my wife frequently orders the app for her meal). The potstickers are excellent too, very addictive.  On to the steak. I'm a major carnivore. I firmly believe that good meat doesnt need messed with much. At TGI's, the steaks are good quality cuts, cooked perfectly to order. I usually don't even add seasoning or steak sauce to mine. Try a bite first before camouflaging the meat, you'll be pleased! For those who like seafood, get the salmon with langostine lobster bites, it's every bit as good as the steak! Out of all the meals at the TGIs in Monroeville, and the takeout (two bags is the norm for us), i've never had a bad meal. They also have a great bartender. My wife loves the dreamsicle, and while I'm not fond of sweet drinks, that one tastes exactly like the ice cream. So to summarize, THIS TGIs should be used as an example of how to serve food and make people happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2?start=20,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003

And if you're reading a Friday's review you probably just want to know if the service is good and the food is hot. Well, this is definitely not a model Friday's, it's pretty lackluster. Service is friendly but nothing exceptional. Waitress was very nice but definitely gave my mom my sweet potato fries and forgot my wife's spinach altogether. And when I did get my sweet potato fries, they were not the full effort. Too soft, not hot enough. Actually in general the food could have been hotter. All that said, not a disaster. Bbq chicken flatbread was solid, pecan crusted chicken salad was solid, ribs were solid. Mozzerella sticks were good.

I must tell you I am not pleased with the service we received from the moment we walked in till the time we left.  When we walked in the young lady at the door stared at me until I said it was just the two of us.  With no words what so ever she grabbed menus and started walking away. We were not sure if we were to follow our not because she hadn't said a word to us.  She turned around and waved us to a table. She then put our menus on the table and walked away. I thought wow. It can only get better from here.  Boy was I wrong.   We waited ten minutes for our waitress to come to our table and she started with. "" what can I get you"". No name.  Nothing about the menu.  Nothing. I asked if there were drink specials.  She brought me a book and added they are all fruity drinks you won't like them.  So I ordered a whiskey.  My gf ordered a water with lemon.  Another few mins pass and we both get waters no lemon. After ten more minutes I finally get my drink. BTW there are upwards of 25 tables that have no one sitting at them. Not real busy. I'm really hungry at this point so we stay to eat. We order the pretzel appetizers. They came fast but they were placed on my table with no words spoken again from the staff My gf orders the ""474"" jd ribs. In return she got a rude comment. ""Oh those ones"" like im cheap or something. also BTW there are no indicators that this comes with sides in the menu. The waitress says it comes with fries and Coleslaw. We want to upgrade to different sides and we get an eye roll. Whatever. I order the jd chicken with mashed instead of slaw. Food comes out pretty fast and tastes pretty good. But my last problem is that the whole we sat there my drink was never refilled and never was I asked if I wanted another one until I was done eating.

So I was fine with this choice. While yes it was lunch hour there was an abundance of empty tables more empty than filled. The service here was terrible it was slow unpleasant and honestly the staff couldn't get our order right. On chance of luck we sat close to the soda fountain and we had to fill our own drinks because well you know the SERVICE SUCKED.  My food did not come out with the rest of my parties meals ... I ordered a burger and fries... But after the 30 minutes it took my family to get food what's another 15 minutes for my own right? So when I finally got my meal the fries were cold and over seasoned whatever that's what ketchup is for let me just mask this terrible food with ketchup! So after picking at my ketchup fries I decided to take a bite of my assumed delicious jd bbq burger... As I bit in and realized I was biting into disappointment the burger was burned and dry with hardly any sauce but whatever that's why ketchup was made right!?! You betcha!  The calamity doesn't end. While I'm saving face trying to enjoy this dry unappetizing now ketchup drenched meal so not to cause any issues my brother and father are having their own problems. I mentioned service sucks right? So on top of having to get our own drinks our server wasn't paying attention and grabbed the plate my brother was eating off of touching his food and knocking it over onto him. He was still eating at it.  Of course this was quite offensive to us but by this point we just want the meal over with.  So after I was finished with my jd ketchup burger © I washed it down with my leftover ice water and my family wrapped up their meals... Oh our server was real quick to bring us the bill and receipt and mention her tip though sadly my father was paying and left the crappy server a tip  I didn't bring management into this as it is really just a lesson learned don't ever go back here  Crappy food terrible service and dirty looking atmosphere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

The only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that other bartender was very nice & handled the wrong meal situation right away.   She also smiled & I could see her having great interactions with the customers she waited on.  But I won't be going back -- for average food & a below average beer selection I have many other options that provide much better customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

9,Corinne F.,"Sugar Land, TX",27,297,217.0,2.0,2017-03-28,Food was ok. Service very slow despite almost nobody in the restaurant. The only thing that saved it was our waitress was extremely friendly and sweet. She helped us celebrate our nephews birthday with so e ice cream. She was smiling and kind.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
12,Rachel D.,"Monessen, PA",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-08,"Food was cold, we didn't get half of it, I had to ask twice for them to bring my drink. The manager wasn't helpful AT ALL. They offered to recook my steak that was over cooked, and the replacement was also overcooked. This place should be called TGIMondays because Monday's suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
8,Jordan F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",194,35,47.0,1.0,2017-08-09,This is the nastiest TGI Fridays I have ever been to the hostess didn't even acknowledge me the bartender honestly hasn't washed her hair in weeks and the place is absolutely filthy.Thank god I don't live in monroeville. I would die. They need to bring John Tafford in this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
10,Deborah M.,"Monroeville, PA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2017-08-11,This place has gone really downhill from years ago. If you sit at the bar that place is very unsanitary. No one cares to sanitize the bar tops! If you come in for the endless apps there are certain stipulations when you get there when you can have those apps. The bar is only for drinks I would not recommend getting food there and also please bring  sanitizer!!!!  I can compare this to a New York city subway because this place is dirty and needs re-organized with their management !!!! We have been to Fridays in the past and it's pathetic that Monroeville's Fridays has gone really downhill!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
14,Rebecca C.,"Havertown, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-13,"T.G.I. Friday's at Monroeville thought it was appropriate to give me another person's hardly touched meal in a clean bowl.  A big group of us went to dinner.  My husband and I are vegan, so we did our best to not be difficult and chose the kid's pasta as our meal.  Because our party was so large, my pasta came out first and they lost my husband's order and had to make a new one.  So my pasta comes out in a bowl pre mixed and with a spoon in it.  I thought nothing of it because I was starving so I ate it.  When I finished, my husband's pasta came out completely different then what was presented to me. He had pasta in a bowl with marinara poured on top. Nothing was pre mixed no spoon in it.  That's when I knew they gave me another child's meal that was hardy touched.  THANK T.G.I. Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
3,Kathleen L.,"Seminole, FL",28,33,31.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"Used to be THE place to go.  Now it seems the general manager and his staff just don't care. The last three times we stopped in to eat at the bar and use our Friday's points it's been a huge hassle. Stacks of dirty dishes near the frozen drink machine is disgusting on its own. No bus pans, just stacks of dirty plates right there. Unsanitary and unappetizing.  It also makes no sense that a food runner should return to the kitchen empty handed.  They stand and chat with the staff and walk away.  Anyways, food has been substandard.  I was given a lecture on why I chose the wrong coupon for my last order, and the so-called woman manager gave me the eyeball as I  being reprimanded and embarrassed by the bartender.  Needless to say, the 1000 points we earned by going there will never be used at the Monroeville store. They need a wake-up call but sadly it seems that the attitude there will not change.  Don't waste your time nor $.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
6,Jamie K.,"Monroeville, PA",17,15,2.0,1.0,2017-11-18,"This place is a joke, I ordered a cheeseburger to go and when they bring it to me the fries were ice cold and the burger looks like it was just thrown in the box all messy. Manager had an attitude when I complained & said I'll make you another but you can keep this burger too. I said I don't want this burger , if it was good there wouldn't be a problem. I said I have many friends who own restaurants, when food is wrong, you remake it then give them a refund. He's clearly an idiot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
4,Chardae J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",137,143,95.0,1.0,2017-12-24,I feel so bad because the staff is always so friendly here but the food never meets my expectations. I don't come here often but when I do I remember why I've stayed away for so long. My recent trip me and my dad were starving after shopping and we both agreed that the food didn't taste like it has soul. The salmon was under seasoned the food took quite a bit for the place to be empty and the server asked if we wanted a box before even looking at our plates. Friendly people is nice but what about the food?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
5,Rachel S.,"Trafford, PA",0,5,,1.0,2018-01-03,If I could give a negative I would.  AWFUL service.  Waited 25 minutes for part of our order and even that was not edible.  Waitress took off before we could ask for the items that were supposed to be on the burger.  She brought the rest of our meal (in a to go container) and got irritated when we complained.  She said a manager would come but never saw him and we left hungry.  Avoid this place if you are hungry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
