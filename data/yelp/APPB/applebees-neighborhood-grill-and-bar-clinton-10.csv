Lee P.,"Raymore, MO",21,173,135,5.0,1/17/2016,Great experience. Started with a call for carry out. Took my order perfectly.  Rolled up and they came right out to my truck.  Paid and got a nice fresh salad.  Shrimp cooked just right. Great flavor overall. This Applebee's gets it. I surprised her with a great tip. Love great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clinton-10
Jemma R.,"Overland Park, KS",49,3,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"Lettuce in my salad was wilted, brown and included rotting leaves. Unimpressed.  They offered to take it off my bill - but as it was a substitute for the mashed potato side in my entree it's not like that is truly a credit is it?  Server seemed apologetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clinton-10
Houston R.,"St. Joseph, MO",4,7,,3.0,7/11/2016,"What is an ""applebee"". Overall it is defined in character by friendly service. The water overfloweth with suspicious lemons, even if one asks to leave them out. The $10 steak chews like a $3 and they might mix up an order of chicken tenders, but they'll always apologize and flash you a smile. And you still can't beat 2 for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clinton-10
Carolyn C.,"Clinton, MO",0,6,,3.0,1/28/2016,"Foods are well flavored, reasonable quantities and reasonably priced.  Our servers were polite, friendly and prompt.  Kinda like dinner at home w/o the cooking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clinton-10
