44,James S.,"Mobile, AL",88,5,8.0,5.0,2017-04-06,"The food was phenomenal. The drink I had was out of this world. The selections were crazy! 50 draft beers, not to mention the cocktails and margaritas, etc. Ambience was lovely, TVs all over the restaurant. Plenty of parking. If I had one thing to critique, it would be the service. Our server was confused. Didn't know a thing about the menu. Had to run and ask for assistance throughout the ordering process, which is understandable considering they opened less than a week ago. She also continuously kept complaining about how tired she was and how sore her feet were? I'm a server too, and rule #1 is no matter how bad a day you're having, you don't let your tables know. Overall, wonderful experience! I highly recommend. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2?start=20,3.7,3.7,3.7,3.7,3.7000000000000006

I'm a fan of BJ's Brewhouse in South Center in Kent WA.  It's a great place for good food, great drinks and killer brews.  If you come anytime soon please be kind and know that they are still in training.  Don't be quick to judge the service or the kitchen. So far so good in my book and I worked in the food service industry so be kind and you don't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636
45,Jerome R.,"Mobile, AL",0,2,,5.0,2017-04-08,"My fiancé and I ate here on their fifth day being open and you'd think they had been open and functioning for years. The service was among the best I've ever had. Every waiter or waitress who passed by our table said hello and smiled. A man by the name of Miles was our waiter and he was entertaining, energetic, knowledgeable, and above all service oriented-he went above and beyond!  LOTS OF CRAFT BEERS AND GREAT COCKTAILS!  I had the Hefeweizen beer, and an American Mule....both are incredible!!  The food was incredible! I had the prime rib which was very juicy and flavorful. The horseradish dipping sauce was not overpowering, yet provided just the right amount of kick to where your taste buds will recognize the taste. The steamed mixed veggies were very fresh, not soggy, and not too hard. Their cheese mashed potatoes are very tasty and taste authentic. Finally, the pazooki is without a doubt an awesome dessert to top of an already feast of a meal. It's a large cookie-several different kinds-that tastes freshly baked and are served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top. It's large enough to split between two people. Don't leave without at least getting it to go...it's the bomb.  I will be a lifelong customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2?start=20,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636

They have their own brews which you can sample and I chose the berry cider and my husband chose the blonde ale. The spinach stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer are delicious, and we have eatin the prime rib dip, the chicken bacon ranch pizza and the hickory brisket burger. The food comes out within minutes of being ordered and prices are pretty average.

47,Kristine K.,"Mobile, AL",36,4,3.0,1.0,2017-04-18,"I was required to give one star. I guess that one star can be for the spinach dip. But, that's all. Thirty minutes for our drink order to be taken. Forty five minutes for our drinks to arrive and my drink was incorrect. Ten minutes later I was able to get a server's attention (not ours) to correct the drink. Ten minutes later another server brought what was supposed to be a sparkling raspberry lemonade. There is no ""sparkle"" at all to it. Five minutes later another server brought me another drink which was totally different and told me it was a sparkling raspberry lemonade. Ok? It was sparkling either. Ordered the appetizer combo after sitting for over forty-five minutes. Twenty minutes later it arrived. Cold. The only think on it that was good was the spinach dip. Chicken was fried gristle. Mozzarella sticks were cold. Eggrolls did not even closely resemble their picture on the menu, not to mention the unidentifiable mush inside them. So, over an hour later for lunch on a Tuesday, with only one adult and two kids, I paid almost $40 and left hungry and irritated.

19,Zenobia C.,"Mobile, AL",1,4,,5.0,2017-04-19,"This place is very new, so I was blown away by the outstanding service. My sister and I decided to try this place and didn't have to wait long even though we were initially told the wait time would be 20-25 minutes for a table. I thought it was very sweet of the staff to bring out food to those waiting outside for a table. That was something I had never seen before. It was also very convenient that a text was sent to my cell phone to let us know when the table is ready instead of having to listen for our name or having to carry around one of the devices that restaurants usually have. The waiter (wish I remembered his name) was very entertaining and knowledgeable about the current specials. We ordered our drinks and entrees and with a few taps on the tablet he advised that they had already been sent back to the kitchen. I enjoyed the fried artichokes for an appetizer and the late night burger for my entree. Maybe next time I will have room for their dessert which looked pretty good. This place has easily slid into my group of top picks for restaurants in this area.

11,Miles D.,"Auburn, AL",0,4,,5.0,2017-04-22,"I had the bacon-guacamole burger which came with beer-battered fries, both of which exceeded my expectations. The burger was a little messy, but tasted satisfactory; the fries were golden and cooked to absolute perfection. Our waitress also made a solid recommendation from their draft. The beer complimented the food very well. Finally, we also received a free dessert after simply downloading the restaurant's smartphone app, and I do declare the ""pizzookie"" (which is a warm cookie topped with ice cream and, in my case, salted caramel) is one of the top 3 desserts in the Mobile area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2?start=40,3.7,3.7,3.7,3.7,3.7000000000000006

It was served with pita chips. It was absolutely delicious, but I love anything with tuna and avocado, so no surprise I loved it.  So many things on the menu sounded amazing, and I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.  We ordered a deep dish pizza upon the recommendation of some nice ladies we met while waiting for our table. It was deep dish pizza, covered in toppings and light on sauce.  My son said it's his new favorite pizza.   My hubs was pleased with their beer selection.  He had a Duvel and a BJ's Brewhouse IPA.  I had a strawberry mojito, and it was well prepared, not skimpy on the alcohol.   Our waiter was really cool and service was fantastic.

16,Rhonda R.,"Mobile, AL",0,12,1.0,3.0,2017-05-03,"Super slow service. Pizza was mediocre the last time I went. It came out on a plate rather than in their signature deep dish. I cannot stress how long our wait was for our dessert. One item was requested ""on the fly"" to feed the one yr old at the table. That item came out with the pizzas and the mushy substance was super cold. We were never offered a replacement.

I was happy to see that this location honors the same recipes, execution, and attention to service as all the other locations I've tried.  There are lower calorie options for those inclined, and they are every bit as tasty as any other menu item.  When I can't decide which great item I want, I'll order my usual: one of their flatbread appetizer pizzas and an order of there broiled Brussels sprouts with Sriracha.

Very accommodating. We were initially seated at a tiny table. The waitress noticed how cramp we were with our big hips and big purses and immediately sprung into action to move us. Then when she left to get our drinks the front host that seated us noticed we were alone and stopped to make sure we had been greeted by our waitress and that our drink order had been taken. We thought that was so considerate seeing that after seating guest with their menus and silverware you normally never see the front hostess again.  The menu is extensive. Lots to choose from. I chose a lite fare(ahi with shrimp) with water. I was happy they allowed me to flavor my water with cucumber and lime. My dinner companion had Parmesan crusted chicken and potatoes. I'm assuming it was awesome because she left nothing on the plate. I ended up taking most of mine home but I must say the flavors were bursting.  So much to choose from I have to come back with my honey.  I'm giving four stars because the seating situation is terrible. I saw 3 men hanging off the edge of 3 different booths all at the same time. They tried to cram 6+ people in each booth and it was not working. I can see how uncomfortable each party was as they tried to enjoy their food. If they could rectify the seating situation this place would be top notch. And I'm normally and anti-chain-restaurant person.

She was also amazed that a manager was ""in the game""!! Anyway, BJ's is here, and I can see why they are successful by last night's experience. The place was packed at 9:00 pm. One last thing to remember. The call ahead feature is real and if you do this you can save yourself a wait. They do need to fix the app advertising a free appetizer with an entre purchase. Evidently this changed but the app ad had not. Again, if you have the right staff, no issue. Our waitress explained the problem and did it in a way that there were no hard feelings.

23,Alexandra F.,"Mobile, AL",44,60,143.0,3.0,2017-07-14,"UPDATE: While I still stand by everything I said in my first review, I will be bumping them from 1 star to 3. My boyfriend had his birthday dinner here so I decided to give them another try. We ordered the app platter that included wings, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and spring rolls. I really liked the wings (get the ones with the root beer glaze), but not much else on the platter. For dinner I ordered the California chicken club, which was very good, and this time I decided to stick with the side that came with it: fries. They were a fully packed restaurant this night but it still took a very long time (longer than normal for a full restaurant) to get our food. I do like how they have many options for my boyfriend as he is a vegetarian and he enjoyed his meal. Because of the fact that there aren't many places to eat in Mobile that are vegetarian friendly, I'm sure we'll be back at some point.  I honestly don't know where to begin with this place. My brother, mother, and I went here for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:15. We were seated right away but had to wait about ten minutes for drinks after we ordered them. It is important to note that at this point there were six tables, including ours, in the entire restaurant. No one at the bar. Six tables. So after we get our drinks we order. My brother ordered fish tacos, mom got the quinoa bowl, and I got the jalapeño burger with a baked potato. We order and we're waiting, and waiting, and waiting. After we ordered we waited for 45 minutes for our food. Now I know that at peek dinner rush in a big restaurant 45 minutes isn't unheard of. But it's now 5:00, and there are six tables in the entire restaurant. We finally get our food and I'm not pleased. Usually when you order a baked potato it comes loaded, unless you say otherwise. Well this one came slathered with sour cream, and a tiny spoon of butter that I almost didn't see due to the sour cream. You may be thinking well why didn't I just ask our waitress to fix it? Because I was really hungry when we got there and now I was feeling sick so I ate what I had. Moving on to the burger, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Between the fried jalapeños and the chipotle mayo I was expecting spicy. I did not get spicy. What I got was a grease trap. The kind of thing were you take a bite of it and grease pours down your fingers. I couldn't finish it because the grease was making me the kind of sick where you eat a bunch of fried stuff and eventually you start to feel like you're the grease trap.  We complained about the wait to our waitress and she did nothing. Didn't bring a manager, didn't ask if we would like to speak to one, didn't offer us any compensation. I honestly don't think I will ever come back here, which is a shame because I really had high hopes for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.308,4.0

We have yet to get a bad dish or service. Normally with a menu as large as theirs it's difficult to do everything well. BJ's has done that very thing. It's become my obsession to work my way through the entire menu. Tonight my wife went with the steak and garlic green beans and I went with the full rack of baby backs with the sauteed brussel sprouts. We started out with the trioof small plates and we chose the turmeric cauliflower, parmesan carrots and the golden beets with goat cheese. Outstanding! My wife said that the Turmeric roasted cauliflower with lentils and almonds was her new favorite. Our server, Sabrina is the absolute best. Their manager Celeste is the greatest. She has a great restaurant with a great staff and she's doing it right. I will post our pictures. Now as I have said before, if you haven't been for whatever reason, GO..The food and drink selection is one of the best in Mobile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2?start=20,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.4760000000000004,4.0

Since this one has opened I have visited 9 times since April during my visits here in Mobile. I usually order car side to go and the woman who does the car side is exceptional. She has a pleasant personality and the absolute best customer service. This is where my compliments end. In the 9 times I've eaten here 8 of those times my order has been wrong or not fresh. I order the same thing each and every time I go ahi Tuna poke and some random entree. The poke is my absolute favorite. However once the chips were stale, twice I had 4 wonton chips, another time the Tuna wasn't fresh, and believe it or not twice I've had it with NO POKE sauce. This is pitiful considering most times when I go in they aren't even busy. Tonight was the last straw. After driving 5 hours into town and ordering (I went inside this time to make sure my food wouldn't be screwed up ) sure enough get to my hotel and absolutely no sauce. Just some raw tuna.

22,Joan G.,"Union City, GA",131,20,86.0,4.0,2017-10-29,"Bj's is cool place to stop in for a quick bite and cocktails. A really nice looking Restuarant very inviting aesthetics. Parking is plentiful and free for all. There is not valet. When walking in there is a free standing sign listing daily specials for each day of the week. The hostess were front and center ready to seat you or direct you to the bar area depending on your preference.  Very nice clean looking restaurant. The bar caught my eye immediately due to the large lighted color coded liquor wall case. It's is very pretty and organized display. Although I was there for lunch I couldn't help but wonder what happy hour or an evening bar area mingling would be like.  The menu had tons of options. Recommendations made me to me were the pizzas, jambalaya, lemon thyme chicken but of course I figured since it was a steakhouse I should try a steak first. Everything appeared to be a good options. Sirloin with asparagus and bowl of lentil soup was the final choice.  The medium prepared sirloin was decent but wasn't what I expected for a steakhouse. Perhaps I should have chosen a different cut of steak. The lentil soup was good similarity to chili in taste. My mother went with the spaghetti and meatballs which was pretty tasty.  I ended up coming back a few days later and just as I thought the bar area was crowded and definitely the place to be. Seating in the bar area is first come first serve booths and all.

52,Hannah B.,"Millers Creek, Mobile, AL",23,1,,2.0,2017-12-09,"I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a restaurant experience than I was with BJ's tonight. It was pretty packed, but it was a Saturday night and we had no issues with waiting the expected 30 minutes the hostess told us it would be. When we got to our table the hostess had forgotten the silverware and said she'd be right back, we never saw her again. That's fine, our waitress will bring them to us, whenever our waitress actually comes to our table, that is. After sitting for awhile another waitress lets us know ours will be right with us. When she gets there we order two waters and a beer and say we need a few extra minutes to look over the huge menu. She brings the water, no beer, and after twenty minutes we're able to get her attention and she brings the beer, but doesn't take our order even though we're ready. We sit and wait at least 20 more minutes and I hear the couple behind us ask another waiter to get their waitress (our waitress). She finally comes back and takes our (and the other couples') orders. We both got sirloin (medium) and broccoli cheddar soup. I got sweet potato fries and my husband got the mashed potatoes. The soup came first and I was happy with it, nothing special but it was soup. Remember the utensil issue I mentioned earlier? Our steak was brought to us by someone other than our waitress and we had no forks. After waiting an unreasonable amount of time my husband got up and walked to the back corner where she was and asked for forks. Finally, we're eating. Tyler cut into his supposed to be medium steak and it's dry and over cooked, mine seems okay, though. As we both keep eating it's like we switched steaks. They were so unevenly cooked that we both had half medium and half well done steaks. It was not appetizing. The sweet potato fries I had were mostly descent if you exclude the ones that didn't seem to be cooked all the way through. Neither of us finished our meal. Before leaving I stepped into the restroom where a worker was talking on her cell in a stall and she actually said ""I'm hiding out in the bathroom"". My husband plans on going back for the bar sometime and hopefully he'll be able to leave a better review but for now, based on their customer service and the badly cooked food, we don't recommend it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mobile-2?start=20,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006
