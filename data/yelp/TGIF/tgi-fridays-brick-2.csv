Ryan G.,"Brick, NJ",0,17,2,3.0,7/3/2013,"This is just another average TGIF. The service has always been fine for me, and the food has also been average. The French onion soup is my go to appetizer, and for an entree, you can't go wrong with a chicken dish here. For dessert, the vanilla bean cheesecake is pretty good.  This TGIF is just like any other, so if you are looking for a chain sit down restaurant to eat at, this place is fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Michael D.,"Brick, NJ",3,77,10,1.0,9/12/2015,"How does this awful chain still exist? Reheated frozen food. Fries so bad and over-seasoned that I had to throw them out. Absolutely dreadful chicken with completely unappetizing veggies. Stay far away, folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Brandon M.,"Brick, NJ",77,48,26,3.0,1/8/2016,This place runs hot and cold as far as service goes. You either get a server that actually cares and wants to make sure your dining experience is great or you get the server that can care less that you are there. More times than not I find myself waiting far too long for the server to even come to my table and greet us. During my most recent experience I waited a total of 15 minutes for the server to realize we had been sitting at the table. Definitely not ok! The server was apologetic and made the experience better after this happened. This place needs an overhaul when it comes to management and training of employees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20

Thomas N.,"Brick, NJ",23,23,19,5.0,8/5/2015,"Had a great lunch experience with the kids today. He waiter was awesome and was very attentive to the kids even though he was working the station and the bar. A job well done and we will return and will definitely ask to sit with Derrick  again.

J R.,"Pine Beach, NJ",0,5,,2.0,11/19/2015,"I can't believe the experience my family had here today 11/19/15. My son got the kids sliders the buns were hard and stale. My mom got onion soup and ham and cheese sandwich, 5 onions in the soup and half a piece of ""cold cuts"" ham and swiss cheese with a piece of lettuce and tomato. We asked for mustard and the cap was gross, caked on old mustard remains...blah. The waitress refilled our iced tea when we got our check and she didn't give us a fresh lemon. Also the waitress was dressed inappropriately she had on tight jeans and a t-shirt. Not a big selection on desserts. This is at the Brick TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Chris M.,"Tappan, NY",0,15,3,4.0,5/23/2014,"Had very good food and great service for my family of five.

Matt G.,"Brick Township, NJ",66,258,3,1.0,10/15/2012,"Really not a fan of this particular TGI's.  Not a fan of the whole chain, really - I cringe every time a group I'm hanging out with ends up going to one of these ""Fast food sit-down places"", since I like my food to have flavor, instead of being slathered in cheese and overpowering BBQ sauces, while being forced to listen to obnoxiously loud music.  Anyway... This particular TGI's is one that I'll likely never be returning to.  The reasoning? I've gotten food poisoning twice in my life, and I eat at some pretty crazy places, as well as barely-sanitary hole in the walls.  Both of these times, were immediately after having a chicken dish at THIS location.  The first time was after eating some kind of chicken / cheese concoction that tasted a little fishy - I should have stopped eating it right there and then, but figured it was just a low quality product that this sort of place churns out.  My mistake, and I ended up paying for it later.  I gave them benefit of the doubt, and went back a second time a few months later (stupidly ordering another chicken dish), and was laid out on the couch for 2-3 days afterwards.   I don't know if they have a cleanliness problem in the kitchen, a broken refrigerator, or are simply not cooking the food properly, but I'm not willing to give them a third chance.  The service here is at least decent, although some of the crowd that this place attracts are of the ""rowdy drunk"" variety.  Not a big deal for me, but I can see that scaring off some of the quieter customers.  The food (the ones that didn't make me ill) is typical ""American Fare"", meaning it's likely slathered in about 2,500 calories worth of industrial-grade cheese, fried, and / or topped with a super sweet sauce that covers up the flavor of the meat.   I'll sooner eat the freezer burned burrito that's been hiding in the back of my fridge for the last 2 years, than come back to this particular location.  Shame, it's in a prime spot on Rt 70.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Jaclyn P.,"Brick, NJ",52,126,94,4.0,11/7/2014,"I actually had a really great experience tonight. We got the endless apps and I think it was worth the money. There was a new host training and he was the nicest sweetest guy and you could tell he was trying really hard. Our waitress was also really nice. They were super busy but the food still came out in a pretty timely manner. The apps were really good as well. We got buffalo wings, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks. Way better than Applebee's. Will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Darwin L.,"Manhattan, NY",70,12,6,4.0,11/2/2014,"My fiancée and I were driving back and we're looking to get a quick bite to eat half way our trip. While driving semi-lost we just happen to see this establishment. We were seated pretty quickly and our server was super friendly and tentative. As we were done eating our appetizers, John stopped by to make sure everything was going ok. He was very funny guy and truly made us feel welcome. The food was great, no complaints. Will definitely come back if we're driving through",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20

Albert P.,"New York, NY",2,17,8,5.0,8/3/2014,The chicks serving us were badass. The food was okay but Jim Marks stole Alberts desert which was disappointing.

Jennifer C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,34,2,4.0,11/9/2014,"Lively ambiance, super fresh food/wine/beer, prompt service, amazing menu variety, spacious bar with expert bartenders, overall cleanliness despite high customer volume, appeal for all age groups-you can't ask more from a widespread franchise! I came here several Saturday nights with my parents and my boyfriend. We all had different items including the Sedona black bean burger, ribs, petit sirloin, Jack Daniels salmon, and spinach artichoke dip.

Fred A.,"Newark, NJ",3,80,51,1.0,2/27/2014,"Aside from being very dirty and cramped, the service here moves at a glacial pace. I was sat and I did not see my waitress for 10 minutes. When she came she was not apologetic in being late. She did not inform me of any specials going on either. She took my order and was gone for 10 more minutes before returning with my drink. I did not see her until my burger was served 20 min later.  My food was ice cold and the buns were stale. Worst TGI Fridays I have ever been to. Definitely take the time to go to another Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20
Stefanie M.,"Manasquan, NJ",0,19,3,1.0,9/17/2014,"Found a fly in my salad! A whole fly! Wings and all! Disgusting! Medium burger came out rare at most. All and all a terrible meal.

Bob D.,"Ocean County, NJ",0,8,,1.0,11/20/2013,"Expectations were low to say the least, I mean it's TGI Fridays so you have to be realistic, but for a night out with the kids this should have been fine.... However I certainly didn't expect the gobs and gobs of forgotten food stuck to the walls of our booth complete with milky white splatter (I can only hope it was milk) and tons of crud where the table met the wall.... Onto the food, boneless wings were less then half coated in sauce and therefore no flavor, ordered a burger no tomato with lettuce/onion on the side, I got a burger with tomato on the bun and nothing else. wife ordered her meal with side of tomato mozzarella salad and got loaded mashed potatoes. Kids meals were adequate So if you want filthy stank fermenting unkept disgusting dirty filthy (yes I know I said that already) conditions along with your food coming out not as ordered then I highly recommend this place! If you want clean sanitary conditions with food prepared as you desire then I seriously suggest you go elsewhere Farewell TGI Fridays, We will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2?start=20

Monica W.,"Brick, NJ",121,86,805,5.0,8/12/2017,"This is my favorite chain resteraunt by far and this particular location is why.  First off, the waiters and waitresses, managers, and staff at this TGIF are fantastic. My mom and I come here often and we love all the servers. Bill is funny, Sandra is sweet, Dan is just the essence of cool, Will is nothing short of professional, and Stefan (seasonal worker) is an MD in training and in my opinion, quite handsome. Shhhh! TG is my favorite manager. If he's working, he always stops to check in your table and says hello. He's a family man and good conversation. He's also an Eagles fan, which is awesome in my book!  Chris, the other manager, is your standard professional. He is friendly and is quick to solve any problem at your table. He's not a birds fan, so I'm bias... so I'll move on to the food now ;) Nothing here is fancy, but it's good food and I've never gotten a tummy ache. I like the grilled salmon with garlic butter, with a side of fresh broccoli and rice. There Cobb salad is also excellent. I ask for extra avocado instead of bacon.  Drinks are great. My mom is a fan of the little black dress Merlot. My dad likes to order their tropical drinks...one of them is called ""lava"" and he says it's the best. I don't drink so I ask for club soda with lots of limes... And they give me like 5.  If you are looking for craft beer or fine wine, this is not the place.  Lastly, become a rewards/stripes member. You can sign up online and then just give your phone number to the server every time you eat. As you collect points, you earn free apps and entrees... yes entrees! As a member you get coupons on the mail for 20 percent off each month, etc. Totally worth it. I would like to see some healthier options but it's a chain and your standard bar and grill, so I'm not going to knock down a star.  This place is awesome. Kudos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2
Liz P.,"Brick, NJ",9,19,3,4.0,1/2/2018,"I know Friday's doesn't have a great reputation, but I came in for lunch and the service was great.  Jesse was attentive, friendly, and extremely personable.  It was a nice change from what this Friday's is typically like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2

Susan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,454,1393,4.0,12/28/2016,This for star review is based strictly on this TGI Fridays and not any other one in the chain.   I'm rating it on the food and service for what it is in this sort of environment.  I've eaten at other Fridays and I've been very disappointed so when my friends and I went to this particular restaurant we were happy to see that the menu had been revamped and updated as well as the Decour is no longer all that junk hanging off the walls. They have excellent burgers and fries that are served hot and fresh as well as many delicious salads.  After nine if you sit in the bar area they have a special appetizer menu for five dollars which is a good deal. And of course the drinks are always good here that goes without saying. I'll be back because they're open late and there's not too many places open late in this neighborhood.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2
Rob M.,"Brick, NJ",5,86,32,3.0,4/29/2017,"We came for the unlimited apps for $10. Really not a bad deal. I feel bad for Fridays, it feels like their ship has sailed. It just seems so empty anymore. But they are trying to stay afloat so you have to give it to them. This location is ok. The service was decent. The food came out pretty quickly. The server was on top of refills. We tried a bunch of different apps. They were all good. I would definitely recommend the app deal. The Jack Daniels wings are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2
Kenneth P. T.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,89,16,4.0,8/24/2016,"Great burgers ! When your in the mood for a burger , then this is the place. Ribs are good and the salads are a good choice when you want lite fare . If your in the mood for just few simple bites then hit the apps. The wait staff are friendly and happy.

Rita S.,"Brick, NJ",0,45,3,1.0,5/10/2017,"This place really went downhill. From the moment we walked in and didn't see many people in there I should've known to turn around and walk out.

Brian G.,"Freehold Township, NJ",139,8,16,3.0,11/5/2016,New menu eliminated previous great deals. Prices have increased but the food quality has not. Very good French Onion Soup.

Andrew J.,"Brick, NJ",60,1,,3.0,4/1/2017,I am at this Friday's frequently and the food is good a majority of the time.. it falls below expectation probably 1 out of every 5 or 6 times I go.

Ed T.,"Lavallette, NJ",0,13,,2.0,3/5/2017,"We came in for lunch and sat at the bar.  It took a few minutes before the bartender acknowledged us.  We ordered our drinks.  Mine was a beer.  I took a sip from the beer and my fiancée saw something floating on the foam.  I asked for another and was promptly poured and served.    It then took a long time for someone to take our lunch order.  My fiancee's salad was not fresh and she removed a lot of the lettuce that looked brown and old.  My chicken sandwich was good not great. We asked for the bill which was given to us by the other bartender not the one who had been serving us up to that point then she made a huge fuss over my fiancee's finger nails.   We felt like the servers didn't really care that we're even there.  Very indifferent towards us.   The food was mediocre.  The service was mediocre.  The beer lines needed to be cleaned.  Another patron ordered a beer, took a sip and promptly stated that is sucked.  He asked for bottled beer.   2 am last night my fiancée woke with a stomach ache and wound up with diarrhea.  My stomach has been feeling strange all day as well.   We will not be visiting this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brick-2

Come to find out they hired new cooks that were finding their way around the kitchen and was holding up our food.  The food was good but by the time we got our  meals, we were ready to go home & sleep. Horrible wait time.  And the server acted like he was high on something. He wouldn't say anything either about our food until  my husband & I got annoyed as to were the food was.
