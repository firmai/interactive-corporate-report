37,Mike L.,"Greensboro, NC",1,46,,2.0,2012-04-14,My family and I ate at Red Robin last night. The service was good. The wait staff was accommodating and attentive. The food was mediocre at best. The bacon on my burger was limp and lifeless. My sweet potato fries seemed to have been cooked hours before they were served to me.   This is the second bad experience at a Red Robin in a row. Good service does not make up for bad food. Don't believe I'll go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
35,Sue P.,"Greensboro, NC",43,34,2.0,4.0,2012-06-09,"Red Robin is one of our standards and usually everything is just fine, including tonight. A few too many ""how is everything?"" interruptions, but the food was exactly what we ordered and tasted great. I loved the server's recommendation to try the ciabatta bun - I ate half of it and it was better than a ""plain"" bun. One of our reasons for going there is they offer gluten-free but we were told tonight that a gluten-free bun cost $1 more. I don't recall that from prior trips but perhaps we weren't told.  They're very careful with gluten-free customers and I applaud that. If a person is gluten allergic (I'm not), then a manager has to bring the food to that person. I just prefer gluten-free products but not for $1. Really, that's unnecessary. Again, we like the place. It's always clean, usually fast (not always so at lunch, which is surprising but tonight was great) and accurate and they refill our drinks and fries without our having to ask. They even offer a to-go cup of diet soda if we want one. Good service, meals that are always up to expectations and a reasonable price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
23,Charlotte H.,"Wilmington, NC",92,197,32.0,4.0,2012-08-01,"Good chain restaurant. I have always ordered their veggie burger and added guacamole; but you can actually substitute a veggie patty for any burger on their menu. They've recently changed their veggie burger from having the ""regular"" toppings like lettuce and tomato to caramelized onions and grilled zucchini. It was tasty! Their appetizers are well priced and you can get a single order of mozzarella sticks for about $3. Rootbeer floats and milkshakes are about the same price as sodas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=60,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
21,Danielle R.,"Greensboro, NC",46,381,145.0,4.0,2012-10-13,"I went to Red Robin a few years ago and wasn't impressed with the food and hadn't been back in a while. I decided to go all out tonight and get a 3 course meal. The appetizer was a pick two of onion rings and fried zucchini. The onion rings were yummy and the zucchini, not so much. For my meal, I ordered a burger with onion straws, horseradish mushrooms, provolone, and some sauce and it was so huge I could hardly fit it in my mouth. It came with big fries as a side, and I will say, Red Robin does know its burgers. For dessert, I ordered the Mudpie. Think ice cream cake with chocolate and cookies and cream ice cream, cookie crusts, fudge, and whipped cream. Definitely big enough for two, or two helpings when you don't feel like sharing.

47,Michael R.,"Greensboro, NC",546,161,13.0,1.0,2014-09-05,"I wish 0 stars was an option. I went to Red Robin at least 1 time per month back in 1991-2 when I lived in California. Over the years it's always been a ""safe"" stop in any city, especially with a young son. A burger and a beer, simple, easy. We decided to try the one in Greensboro about a year back when we moved here. Summary of 3 different visits: Visit 1: Waited 15 minutes to sit in a half-full restaurant. Finally ordered at the bar with my wife and son. Burgers took over 30 minutes to come out-this IS their specialty right? Visit 2: Ordered takeout and the order was completely messed up. Had to run back to get the right food. Visit 3: Restaurant is 1/2 full but there are at least 20 people waiting. We are told it will be 15 minutes. Empty tables with old meals sit everywhere. Finally we are seated after 30 minutes (too tired and late to go elsewhere). They seat us at a partially cleaned table-and finish cleaning. There is a steak bone that sits at the table next to us. We converse and are laughing with the other family sitting next to us. Nothing comes out right; all overcooked. We complain but nothing. Had left a message with corporate. Someone called our home phone but left no message (caller ID).  I hope the District Manager reads this (not the GM) as this is the worst Red Robin I've ever been too-and it's consistently bad.

Once I arrived, it took roughly 10min from the time I walked into the restaurant till someone actually took a drink order for me. Once my order was taken the food came out relatively quickly. I sat for at least 5 minutes before the manager came by and brought me silverware (my server had not checked on me). Then once I cut into my burger it was cooked well done and I had ordered it medium well. Now, this ""gourmet"" burger I had was the equivalent of a McDonald's $1 menu burger. It's really no wonder it was overcooked because it was so very thin! I had also asked for the relish to be on the side, which it was left off completely! When my server finally came by to check on me I informed her it was cooked improperly and she offered to have them do it again. By this time I had exactly enough time left to get back to work and so I declined and walked out. I will never ever eat at this restaurant and most certainly never this location again!

27,Amanda K.,"Morrisville, NC",35,74,84.0,2.0,2015-04-12,"When I first experienced Red Robin it was great. The burgers were big and juicy, and the garlic fries were amazing. Ever since my first visit, overall quality has gone down hill. My husband and I decided to eat here mainly for some bottomless garlic fries. We were seated promptly, but I noticed there were about 3-4 waitresses around the Hostess area. They were all talking and laughing, and it pretty much stayed that way the entire visit. They would go take care of customers, but then come back to their little station to talk. The worst part was that a manager (who I assumed to be the manager was in the middle with them) After we were seated we ordered our drinks and we took a minute to decide. Our waitress was nice enough, but after she took our order and brought our food, we didn't really see much of her. She checked on us once after our food came out but she was almost nonexistent after that. The food itself was just ok. I ordered the mushroom swiss on texas toast with garlic fries. The burger was cooked as I ordered, toast was good, and mushrooms were seasoned with a lot of fresh garlic. However my fries were not good at all. Since when does Red Robin skimp on the fresh garlic for their garlic fries? What I got was fries with sprinkled garlic powder and grated parmesan. The garlic seasoning even tasted off. My husband ordered their new Nacho Crunch Burger with garlic fries as well. His fries were the same, but his burger was incredibly thin (almost to the standards of McDonalds.) We usually save half of our meal for dinner at night, but his burger was so thin it wasn't filling enough and he ate the whole thing. We came for bottomless fries but ended up not getting any. Our waitress finally showed up after we sat not eating/talking for about 5 minutes. We paid and left quickly. It's becoming apparent that Red Robin is cutting corners with their food and is turning into the type of restaurant that wants to get you in and out as quick as possible. There are plenty of other places around Greensboro you can go to for a better burger than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.12,2.84

6,Sarah G.,"Raleigh, NC",70,433,279.0,3.0,2015-07-18,"We have not been to a Red Robin in about a year or more, and the last time was in NY. I think I rated it a 5-star. Today's visit was just ""average"" in my opinion. Cleanliness: I believe we arrived shortly after their lunch crowd left because the floors were filthy. Tons of food debris, used napkins, straw wrappers, etc littered the floor. It wasn't until we were about to leave that I saw an employee begin to start sweeping up the mess. Our table was kind of sticky as well. Atmosphere: Again, meh. I have been to a brand new RR before and it was classy... Almost ""too fancy to be a RR."" This location needs a definite update. The whole, ""TV in the floor"" upon walking in seems so dated and of course, it wasn't on anyways.  Food: I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I tried the California chicken sandwich and got it wrapped in lettuce instead of on a bun. It was pretty good. A little tough to eat on the lettuce but I managed. Like another Yelper mentioned, the ""bottomless fries"" was a measly portion. I only had one order brought out to me because I didn't want to feel like a pig asking for another but I could have gone for another 1-2 orders because there were so few given to me. I'm sure they do this to reduce waste because people probably ask for more and then don't eat them.  My husband got the Whiskey River Burger in a lettuce wrap... Originally the chicken version was brought out for him but the server caught that mistake before placing it in front of him. No big deal, the correct meal was delivered after a few more minutes. Again, he had a tough time with the lettuce wrap because it really wasn't a ""wrap"" it was more like 2 stacks of iceburg ""buns"" hence, when you'd bite into it, everything slipped out the backside. If it were actually WRAPPED in lettuce, it would have held it all in better. We ordered the meatball kids meal for our daughter with broccoli. The meatballs were pretty good. They came with these little breadsticks you could stab the meatball with to dunk it in the marinara sauce. She seemed to really enjoy them. The broccoli seemed to be not steamed enough... It was pretty hard still.  Service: Our server was ok. She was friendly but I felt like another server was at our table more than our actual one was. And after we were done eating, the bill was dropped and we waited sooooo long to have it picked back up... As our daughter was meting down because she wanted to leave .

63,Stephanie W.,"Greensboro, NC",0,16,7.0,2.0,2015-09-26,"Pitiful. That is the best word I can come up with to describe this restaurant today.  I'll start with the good- our waiter was friendly and helpful. Drinks and fry refills were brought to the table quickly.  Now for the bad.  My husband got one of their ""double"" burgers, which come with 2 smaller patties. This turned out to be about the amount of meat on a double burger from Wendy's, but with less flavor. I'm not sure why they ask for a preferred temperature with these burgers, because they will all inevitably come out well done. The fries on both the initial order and the single refill we got were cold. My spicy sombrero salad was more like a sad sombrero salad. The chicken came out burnt on one side- of course, it was the side on the bottom that they tried to hide from me. The salad was missing black beans, cilantro, lime wedge, and bell peppers. After pointing this out, beans and peppers were added but the other toppings were still nowhere to be found. To top it all off, the avocado was brown. I know this place serves enough avocado between burgers and salads that there is no reason it shouldn't be fresh. My son's mini corn dog poppers were ok, but to be fair, that's a really tough item to screw up since you just have to throw it in the fryer. Finally, the floor on the way to the bathroom was so slick, I almost fell down on the way there and back. Oh, and it would be nice if the doors all had functioning locking mechanisms.

7,Patrick H.,"Trinity, NC",80,138,90.0,4.0,2015-12-01,"I've always like Red Robin and this is the location I visit most often. The staff here is friendly and attentive on every visit so far. The restaurant is large and has its own style, right down to a television in the floor when you walk in. We opted to kick off the meal with pretzels with beer cheese. I was not disappointed, the flavor of the cheese rocked and the pretzels were soft and soaked it up nicely. For the main event, I opted to get the hottest burger Red Robin could throw at me, the firey ghost pepper tavern double. The burger was cooked perfectly, had a ton of flavor and was overall very delicious, but had virtually no heat. That's the issue I have with not just Red Robin, but most burger places I try. If I see ghost pepper/fire/volcano/molten/death in title of a burger, I want a my tongue to melt. The fries are awesome here, crisp, flavorful and my favorite part of all, ENDLESSLY ENDLESS. There were several sauces that you can choose from that are free for dipping,  and others with a small fee but more upscale ingredients.  Overall, I have not had a bad experience here, though it does hit me in the wallet abit hard being a bit overpriced. But as long as the service is consistent, burgers delicious and the fries ever flowing, I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.384,2.56

Get back in your car and go a mile down the road to the original Big Burger Spot and enjoy a much better burger combo than what you would get at Red Robin. That said, you could certainly do worse. There is something to be said for bottomless French fries if you're really hungry. It also helps they are the big wedge style steak fries. Burgers here are pretty good, if it weren't for a wealth of other locally owned and operated burger boutiques I could see it being one of the better spots to enjoy some Angus goodness.

I mean Greensboro is loaded with independently owned burger spots that are out of this world, so I certainly wouldn't make Red Robin a regular stop. After my last visit to any Red Robin, not just this one, I swore I'd never come again! Well wouldn't you know I got the Christmas gift card that said, ""Your going back to Red Robin""! My problem in the past at all of them across the board is the bottomless fries campaign. It has always been a struggle to get them to bring back more fries without a long wait in between! I will say that this recent visit was quite different, with every request for additional fries being filled in a very reasonable fashion so that we weren't done with our meal and left with just fries! The burgers are indeed good, as well are the chicken sandwiches. They aren't anything to rave about, but not as bad as a meal at Applebee's for sure! Red Robin is the type of place to stop if your traveling somewhere and dread that pit stop at a McDonald's or Wendy's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

49,Marcus W.,"Fletcher, NC",9,98,2.0,3.0,2016-01-27,"I really enjoyed the Habanero burger I got here. Forget the name but the flavor was amazing. The disappointment was I ordered it MEDIUM. Came out almost well done. Some of my bottomless fries were over cooked slightly (turning white and transparent) So I'm not sure if they are sitting around pre-cooked in a heater. But there was only like 3 tables there, so why would they not cook fries to order? I don't understand honestly. That's just pure laziness.  This place has so much potential. I don't come to Greensboro a lot. But I'd be willing to try it again sometime. But someone mentioned a place called ""big burger"" under me. I might try that next time I'm in town and see how it is, before I gives this place another go. The Red Robin in Florida I went to was just a lot better overall. I mean, where's the passion? If you over cook a burger or fries you start over. It's fast food, it's the easiest menu.  Overall as a company I love them. Lots of unique stuff. I hope it gets better, but I probably wont try it for a few years, again because I'm hardly ever in the area.

51,Muranda D.,"Greensboro, NC",9,139,,2.0,2016-02-08,"I decided I wanted to try Red Robin, because I saw a commercial on TV for the bottomless fries, and I was like, ""I have to have those!""  I ate very little Saturday morning/afternoon because I was so ready to smash some bottomless fries.  My boyfriend and I got there probably around 5:30, so we were still a little ahead of the dinner rush.  There was a wait, but it wasn't very long- maybe 10 mins.  The lobby was spacious, and the pictures on the walls were entertaining enough to pass the time without watching the clock.  We were seated, and shortly after greeted by our server.  She was friendly enough.  They have little playmakers for you to do trivia on for a charge; we didn't partake in that because we still try to be frugal.  We didn't have an appetizer, again, preparing for the bottomless fries. When we ordered our food, I confirmed with our server that the fries were in fact bottomless (I wanted to make sure she understood why I was there and what was up.) My boyfriend and I each got burgers.  I got the burger with guacamole, bacon and mayo.  It was wonderful.  I like the colour of the beef, it was nicely presented and it tasted amazing.  The first thing I did was pour my fries out of the little metal thing it comes in, into my basket, and placed my fry container on the edge of the table, in my head, what would mean ""I'd like more, please!""  She promptly ran by and grabbed up my fry thing, and kept moving.  I was hoping that was like.. An unspoken understanding.  I realized shortly afterwards it wasn't, so I wasn't upset about that.  I shouldn't make assumptions.  I asked her if she could bring each of us some more, and she said she would.  After that, she seemed very rush to get us out of there, which I understand.  I've severed and bartended and the amount of money you make is usually correlated with how quickly you can turn tables, but we had not been there that long, and I wasn't finished yet.  After she brought us our first refill of fries we were both sitting there without any drinks, and she says, ""Can I get you guys some to go drinks?"" Maybe she legit wanted us to take some with us, but it seemed more so that it was our que to leave.  For our second refill of fries, she only brought us one; my boyfriend didn't get any, even though we asked. Anyways, I was really underwhelmed and a little upset when I left.  I don't think I'll go back, which is sad because the food was good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Not sure why but we waited another 5 or so minutes before she returned to take our order. 30 minutes later we received our food. The whiskey wrap had way to much ranch dressing, and the French onion soup had so much salt you couldn't eat it. The manager came over and inquired on our food. I told him about the food issues and asked if he had tasted the soup. He offered a different soup which was better and took the wrap off our bill.

So we waited, after 15 minutes we saw many people leaving, 20 minutes and more people leaving, after 30 minutes goes by even more people have left after they got through with their dinner, but there was only a few people that were let in to be seated.  Now 40-minutes have gone by, so I got up and went to an area where I could view the dinning areas, and about 40% of all the tables and booths were cleaned and empty, so I asked them if they had a shortage of servers for all the tables, and after a few minutes they  finally told me that the kitchen wasn't able to keep up, so they were slowing down letting people in to be seated, and they couldn't tell us how much longer we'd have to wait before being seated. So after waiting 45-minutes, with no information as to how much longer of a wait time there would be, we decided to leave and we found some other place to eat super. This was a Friday night around 7:30, one of their busiest days of the week, and they couldn't keep up with just over 50% of their seated guests. I've been to this same place many times in the past and there was a reasonable small wait time, and never have I experienced anything like what I just experienced last night. I have to assume there's been a change in management. The staff should have inform the people waiting that they were experiencing issues in the kitchen and there waiting times may be a little longer, and let the people decide if they wanted to wait longer or leave, instead of continuing to tell everyone coming in that there is a 25-30 minute wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be seen as the guy who keeps sending his sandwiches back . I was very disappointed on that day. On a positive note, I did receive the meal free of charge, though I still paid for my appetizer.   I'm trying not to dock this place another star because the other visits were fantastic, but I'm more skeptical now, given my recent experience.
