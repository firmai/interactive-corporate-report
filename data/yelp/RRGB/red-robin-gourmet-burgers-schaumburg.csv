Angela S.,"Highland Park, IL",2426,776,6569,4.0,1/6/2018,"There was a time in my life where New Year's Eve consisted of more than a trip to the mall and dinner at a fast food chain, but our service by Danny was a top notch fancy five stars combined with some awesome family time. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I've never been to a Red Robin before my visit to this location. I always figured it was like a Hardees or some really subpar fast food joint. I honestly had no idea it was a more ""upscale"" burger joint.  On New Year's Eve it was too cold to go to the Lincoln Park Zoo Lights, so we took the kiddos to Woodfield Mall to catch some last minute sales and find a spot to hang out. After shopping, and by the time we were about to leave, everyone was cranky hungry so we decided to stick around and eat at Red Robin. It was a nice experience, especially since the place was full with lots of other families.  Danny was our server and came immediately to our table after we pressed the call button on the machine. He was so nice and helped us navigate the menu. We came for the gourmet cheeseburger specials that consisted of two thin patties of beef and unlimited fries (ummmm, yes please). He let us make minor substitutions, and our burgers came out charbroiled with excellent flavor. I'm a thin french fry lover, but I thoroughly enjoyed the potato goodness offered here by the unlimited seasoned steak fries. We were promptly served, the atmosphere was fun, and our food and service rocked! Thanks Red Robin. I'm pretty sure we found our new stop during our random Woodfield Mall visits. Perhaps a New Year's Eve tradition?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Kenn W.,"Arlington Heights, IL",18,24,50,5.0,11/9/2017,"It's Red Robin, you know what to expect - it's not a the gourmet burger they advertise but it is a decent burger.  Lindsey is the sole reason for the 5 star review. We were seated in her section and she was so friendly and attentive that she made that decent burger taste ALMOST like a gourmet one.  Come on by and enjoy the bottomless steak fries dusted with a liberal dose of their original seasoning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Phil S.,"Sauganash, Chicago, IL",127,519,3655,2.0,7/13/2017,"Yesterday I was out at Woodfield and saw that Red Robin had a special on their burgers for $6.99.  Too good a deal to believe so I called my sister and we made the trek out to The Woodfield Red Robin.  Her from da suburbs Vernon Hills and me from da NW side of da city.   Well as it turns out this burger was a huge disappointment absolutely nothing like the burger I ordered at the Niles Red Robin.  Where I ordered in Niles I ordered the Smoke & Pepper angus burger on a ciabatta bun w/cheddar cheese, bacon & bbque sauce cooked medium rare.  Now that was a great burger!! We can both stand to shed a few pounds me more so then her so in keeping with that we decided to split the burger and a Cobb salad.  I ordered one of the 4 pub burgers that was included in the $6.99 price range.  The picture on the ad showed a double burger w/cheese oozing out, crispy onion rings sandwiched in w/tomatoes, lettuce & Sriracha sauce.  She ordered the Cobb salad which was also equally disappointing.  Normally I'm not a fan of the thick cut steak fries, but served hot and dipped in ranch they were pretty good.  My sister also had a complimentary Oreo cookie milk shake that we split (uhh so much for the diet ).  The burger that came out was a poor representation of the burger in the photo flattened into what looked more like a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  It was tasty, but a huge disappointment.  The Cobb salad was also bland w/tiny pieces of unripened avocado, toast that were tasteless along with a piece of chicken that was actually pretty tasty, but overall the salad was very disappointing. The hostess put us in the back section away from the section with all the kids (kind of like a Chucky Cheese).  The service wasn't the greatest.  We were seated, ordered our food including the Oreo shake that we split wo/any napkins or utensils.  I told her we just bobbed for our food so we didn't need any utensils.  Well we did finally get our utensils after my sister searched out to a different server and I went to the bar to grab some napkins it was game on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Eric A.,"Elkhart, IN",86,84,221,4.0,12/9/2017,"I love Red Robin, and this place disn't disappoint.  Their chain-wide on-table device used for ordering and paying your bill is amazing and hassle free.  The layout of the restaurant is a bit cramped when it is extremely busy.  Food is good as always and the service by my waiter was pleasant and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Adrian G.,"Algonquin, IL",17,29,72,4.0,10/28/2017,Overall my wife and I really enjoy Red Robin burgers. To be honest the size of the burgers have gone down a lot since 2010's but the flavors are the same. The meat is juicy (sometimes too greasy in my opinion depending on what you order) but overall Red Robin is a place we visit fairly frequently especially when we visit Woodfield Mall. Their nachos are very good but again the portion is pretty small in my opinion. My favorite burger is the burning love which comes with jalapeños. My wife likes their tavern double burgers. The drinks are good and tower of onion rings are always impressive. If you never have been to Red Robin you definitely should check it out and see what you think of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Amber G.,"St. Charles, IL",36,5,11,4.0,10/16/2017,Overall service was what we expected. The only down part about our visit was that it took about 5 minutes for anyone to even see that we were waiting to get seated. I had to peek into the dining area a few times for anyone to see us and there was only 6 tables being waited on around 1:30pm. Once seated our waiter was nice and got us everything we asked for. Food was good! Could of been a bit hotter. Overall favors were good! Would come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Lefai K.,"Chicago, IL",282,636,421,4.0,1/31/2017,"I love me some burgers. I haven't been to Red Robin in awhile but this place is consistent. So many burger options, but I always gravitate to bleu cheese because bleu cheese is so delicious. This time around though, I decided to do something different andwent with the Prime Chophouse burger.  The burger had sautéed mushrooms, provolone, dijon mustard, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun... all topped with a nice and tangy, but not over-powering steak sauce. I had mine cooked ""medium"" and it was cooked perfectly. I paired it with some garlic fries and it was a lunch that hit the spot. The waitress/server was nice and attentive, although I had to ask her twice for some mustard, but overall, everything was all-good. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the inside mall entrance, the bathroom was in decent shape. Everything was clean and in working order. The toilet itself looked kind of sketchy, so I'd go with the good ol' squat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Natasha M.,"Villa Park, IL",8,138,,4.0,8/1/2017,I really liked this red robin. It was my bf birthday and he wanted to come here. He ended up getting a free burger from the rewards and a free sundae. It was a bit busy there but our waitress was very nice and she was attentive and such. She wasn't gone for forever and she didn't forget. The burgers were delicious and we had a great time. Not one bad experience here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Tina L.,"Chicago, IL",508,522,1348,5.0,6/8/2016,"Red Robin will always have a special place in my heart. I loved it as a teen (when I first started going there) and now, I will always remember it as my husband's and my first date spot when we first started dating. Their burgers are phenomenal, and who can argue against bottomless fries? The freckled lemonade is so delicious and refreshing, albeit a little pricey. The best option is to order a burger with the bottomless fries and split it. The burgers are huge and you'll end up really full after the bottomless fries anyway.  Side note: This place is great for kids. Go for your next family outing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Kathleen C.,"Carpentersville, IL",1,1,,5.0,11/10/2017,"I placed a catering order with the Schaumburg, IL Red Robin.  I ordered the new Gourmet Burger Bar for 70 people.  They were amazing!  The burgers were hot, the condiment bars were very impressive, and everything was delicious.  The staff at the Schaumburg, IL restaurant was very kind, helpful and courteous.  They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect and met my needs.   I would highly recommend the Red Robin Gourmet Burger Bar and the Schaumburg, IL restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1525,2754,3.0,10/19/2016,"You know what? I am a fan! I like the food and the restaurant is pretty accommodating. I've been here a couple times now and I'd come back. I most recently came for my husband's b-day and I tried setting up a reservation, but they don't take them. Still, when I called on a Monday to book for that Tuesday, they said they could set aside space for 15 of us. However, when we showed up, they had no record of the conversation taking place, though I am sure that I called this location and I spoke with someone who kept putting me on hold and seemed to be checking with another employee about the request. They had a suspicion that another employee who wasn't there spoke with a manager who wasn't scheduled either and they failed to notify the next day's crew. Nonetheless, the place was practically empty, they apologized profusely, and they seated us in no time. Our server Alejandro was on top of everything. He kept coming by to check on us and make sure people had what they asked for or we got to place extra orders as needed. They let us take our time and we were able to split up the bill easily with their table kiosks. With 15 people, that was greatly needed and appreciated. It really took the guess work out of separating who had what so people could pay quickly when they were ready to leave at various points throughout the evening. This isn't my favorite place for burgers and fries, but it is a top contender for large events such as this. Aside from the scheduling mix-up, which is understandable since they don't even take reservations to begin with, they've been reliable when we've come and they are affordable. I would highly recommend them for a casual party or family outing because the menu had a little something for everyone who had preferences or dietary restrictions among our friends - kids to adults, meat lovers to vegetarians or chicken-centric, and then some! I normally would get a burger here but was feeling like I wanted something lighter and went with the Marco Pollo Chicken Burger, which still finds a way to pack in the calories. Regardless, it was fabulous. So, I can vouch for the beef and the chicken! You can't really go wrong with bottomless fries and there are different kinds from which to chose. They have tons of side options and appetizers, drinks and desserts. Easy peasy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Nicky C.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,5,,2.0,12/14/2017,The food was horrible and the wait time took 2 hours and 23 minutes it was ridiculous! I thought about leaving about an hour in.

Prabodh M.,"Wheeling, IL",21,36,20,2.0,5/4/2017,"This Red Robin outlet was disappointing. We went there on Sunday late afternoon. It was crowded with around 30 minute wait. That was not a problem since the Woodfield mall is an amazing place to spend time. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip and Burning Love. The dip was not that great. The artichoke pieces on the bottom of the dip seemed stale.The burger was quite soggy and not like the one I am used to at other Red Robin outlets. The fried jalapeno pepper that comes on the top of the burger was soggy as well. It looked like it had been fried in the morning. Usually the pepper is crunchy and fried fresh and is why I always order that burger. The service was good none the less.  I am going to avoid this outlet on weekends, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Justin U.,"Chicago, IL",178,286,1434,4.0,7/28/2016,"When I'm in Woodfield, the first place I think to go for lunch or dinner is Red Robin.  It's just an enjoyable combination of lively surroundings, beers and burgers. And of course their unlimited fries (which I never get more of because I'm usually too stuffed). One time when I was there I decided to try something different and so I went for their teriyaki burger.  It has pineapples and cheese and teriyaki sauce.  It's is such a great combination of flavors that the only other thing I try when I go there is their teriyaki chicken.  It's like the burger except with a chicken breast between the buns. The place is usually packed during meal time though they do seem to turn people around quickly.  When I've waited for a table, the most it took was about 20 minutes.  The last time I went it was very busy so I opted for Kinfork across the parking lot.  But as good as their burger was, it wasn't as good as Red Robin's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg
Nathan B.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,46,,2.0,9/24/2017,Burgers are very good. Unlimited steak fries are a bonus. Reason for two stars is the service. Multiple times we get seated and our server doesn't come over for 10 minutes. Last time we walked out and we have never returned. It appears to be a management issue.

Anna M.,"Elmwood Park, IL",13,33,12,4.0,5/31/2017,"They have bottomless fries and some drinks, but their burgers are so big that most likely you won't be able to fit one more portion of fries lol. I love this place. I come here from time to time. I'm never disappointed with their burgers as they are always delicious. The only thing i would chance in this location - i would wash dishes more carefully, as there are always a lot of fingerprints, which I really DO NOT like.

But either time the consistency was the same, the food came out at a consistent time and it was well worth the wait(whatever it was) because the burgers were great and were cooked to specification(medium-rare I think it was my case if I remember right). This particular Red Robins honestly... Was pretty cool on the inside. Yep that's right, cool, it was cool on the inside.

It seemed that our waitress was able to see all her other tables except us and she lacked a sense of urgency when it came to things like bringing us water. They brought me the wrong shake and when I asked if I  had received the correct one, the look I got was shocking.   My friend ordered a burger and fries (which are bottemless) and when she received her meal, she had 5 fries next to her burger.

Needless to say I was worried about the time (we sat down an hour til the show started!), but service was fast. I wish I got the name of our server - he was fun, but really speedy and continued to check in on us without hovering. He also gave us directions to the Improv, which ended up being super helpful! I got the Garden (veggie) Burger, and my +1 got the Bleu Ribbon Burger. He said his was good. My patty was really disappointing since it was undercooked - it was very pale and mushy when it should have a good crispiness or sear on it. Next time I'll try the cod. I wish they offered non-fried fish options! You can't get your bottomless fries BEFORE your burger comes out, but they oblige afterwards. There's a $1.50 upcharge for sweet potato fries, but they're yummy! Our speedy server got us hot fry refills very quickly - both kinds, thankyouverymuch. I'm still surprised we had time to eat our burgers AND indulge in 2x bottomless fry orders within the hour AND we were on time for the show.

This is very much so a family restaurant. If you go later in the evening you can avoid most of the crying children lol  The menu is pretty extensive and the bottomless fries/salad + free substitutions are pretty amazing.

Corin A.,"Glencoe, IL",26,7,3,4.0,2/20/2016,"I recently went back to this location and things have changed A LOT! The staff are more aware and the food quality is getting much better!  I have now been to this location 4 times and ALL four times I've experienced a problem and left unsatisfied every time! The food is FANTASTIC but the service is ridiculous. My only complaint about the food is that we were not given the option to say how we wanted our food prepared. My boyfriend was unsatisfied with his burger and said it tasted charred when he prefers it medium well. Our server seemed to only be attentive when we were paying the bill! I had to ask to get a refill on my fries and we were only given one refill on the fries when we asked for 3 as there was three in our party. Anytime she came to the table she would say ""everything ok?"" Rather than ""can I get you anything"" which is how a server is supposed to phrase it! Her asking if everything was ok seemed to me like her way of getting out of getting us anything.  We went for their Veterans Day special because my boyfriend is a veteran. Their new system with paying with the kiosks is annoying and hard to figure out when you have multiple people paying and you have to put in your rewards card and redeem a reward.  When we asked for the manager they came quickly which was nice however it took 3 tries for them to fix the bill which the server never fixed in the first place so we could all pay separately. (She also never asked how we wanted the bill to look)  This was just one experience. I'm never going back to this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=40

The burgers are below what you get at a 5 Guys or Smash Brothers. The fries are not tasty either. The tables are too close and the service is less than attentive. My 13 & 10 year old boys didn't want to finish their cheeseburgers. They do have gluten free buns which made my wife happy. The bathrooms are also very unclean.

Sandra Y.,"Chicago, IL",292,146,349,2.0,4/26/2015,"Worst service ever. We were basically avoided the whole time we were there. Our server kept saying they were busy, but had time to go to every other table, except ours. I'm not sure what we could have done wrong?? The only time he was attentive was when he was giving us the check & picking it up.... We didn't even have to ask for that. If you're gonna have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn't take half an hour to get a new one.  My cousin got the broccoli & the first time it was steamed nicely. The second time, not so much. The server said they boil it really quick, but they were dry and raw. They seemed to have been microwaved for a few seconds. Yet, they took forever to come out. I don't understand. Also, I wanted garlic parmesan fries, thinking they'd be fresh crushed garlic & parmesan tossed with the fries... but nope, they use garlic powder! What a disappointment!  Do not order this, ever!  Other than that, the appetizers and burgers were good. We got the cheese sticks, tower of onion rings, and fried zucchini. Burgers we got were sautéed shroom and the big pig out. I appreciated that the apps came out super fresh. That's really the only thing keeping me from giving one star.  You can get a good burger anywhere else, but these were still pretty decent. It seems like a hit or miss whenever I come here. Sometimes I like the burgers, sometimes I don't. I've noticed the service at this location sucks more than the other Red Robin locations I've been at. I wonder why?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=40

Yes, there are certainly other burger champions in Chicago but the great thing that I love about Red Robin is that there are no rules or stipulations. It's simply quality food with great service. You also won't find any French cheeses with odd pronunciations here. The burgers here have the right bun to meat ratio unlike other places where the burger comes out like the shape of the roman numeral one. For me, the Blue Ribbon Burger continues to be my favorite - blue cheese, steak sauce, and fried onion straws. It's the perfect combination of strong flavors and textures.

During the week, you'll have no problem, and if you work in the mall, you get a little discount. The bar is nice, with a TV playing local sporting events, and the bartenders have been consistently friendly and attentive. The only reason this place is not 5 stars is because they used to value mall employees business and promotion of their restaurant by giving extra fries to go, to share with our co-workers. While I do understand that there is a bottom line, I wish the management would understand that when we bring fries back to our stores, it encourages our co-workers to have lunch at RR.

We asked for more of the bottomless sweet potato fried and were told it would be 4 minutes and it was over 10.

The Woodfield location is a completely different story. Where should I begin? The place is filthy, possible health code violations. There was food all over the floor/seats. The bathroom was very dirty as well. There were 3 of us at the table and they brought 2 forks, 2 knives and 2 napkins. We started off by ordering 3 waters with lemon and a freckled lemonade. He brings the water with no lemon. Then it took about 15 minutes to get him to come back and ask if we were ready to order. We again asked for lemons for our water. We had also asked for another set of silverware and more napkins. He never brought them so we walked over to the bar and asked the bar tender who was able to get them to us immediately. Finally, our waiter came back with the lemon slices and we put in our orders.  When our orders arrived mine and my mom's orders were wrong. They sent them back and brought them back a second time. My order had been corrected but they still brought out the incorrect order for my mom. She had ordered broccoli as her side instead of fries. All three times they brought her order they brought fries. We finally flagged down a manager since our waiter was nowhere to be found. He said it would be right out. It took about 10 minutes and they brought it to her. Once we started eating our waiter who had been MIA for a while came and asked how things were. My boyfriend's response was ""eh, it's alright.."" so that our waiter would know we have not been too happy with the service so far. Our waiter laughed and said ""okay"" and walked away. We were all shocked that he didn't even ask what was wrong or what could be done to make the experience better.  As everyone knows RR is known for their unlimited side dishes. We had ordered fries and broccoli. Our waiter never came back to ask if we would like more. He came over to ask if we needed dessert or anything else. We put in multiple orders of our sides at that time since we knew he probably wouldn't come back to check on us for another 20 minutes if not longer. If you're going to have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn't take half an hour to get a new one. Also, it took forever just to get a refill on our waters. We shouldn't have to flag you down or ask multiple times for more water. If you aren't going to be attentive leave a pitcher of water at our table.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location. I have given this location a few tries and every time it seems to get worse.

Time goes the hostess approaches us to ask if we've been helped . . no, but she did eventually arrive to our table. We were given forks with lettuce stuck to them which could be easily forgiven if everything just went smoothly from there, but unfortunately they didn't. Our server forgot my water and never got my wedge of lemon which I didn't even bother asking for. We were given the wrong shake and had to flag someone else to correct it, which was fine since they corrected it after some discussion. They forgot straw so we ask. They forgot my sauce for my bottomless fries, so had to give another reminder there.  Along that note, I had asked for bottomless fries and literally was given a scant amount with my burger. So of course I had to ask for more. Our server passed over us several times without asking if we were okay. It seemed she went to everyone else's table to check on them, but ours which seemed kind of weird to us since we really weren't giving anyone issues despite what was happening. Had to get her attention and she said she'd give me refills for my water and fries . . . let's say it was a while till we got them and my friend said when she looked our way she kind of had that ""o yea. . "" look about her, which we then finally got our items. Also, they hadn't explained the kiosk properly to us as I hadn't ever used one before and didn't seem too keen to stick around long enough to see if we needed help with it.

We came on a very busy Sunday afternoon, so we didn't expect lightning-fast service. But surprisingly, we got it. Our server, Shannon, was dead tired, but made sure that she took very good care of us. We never had to ask her for refills or flag her down for the check. She rocks.  The service is great. The food is just okay. It wasn't terrible, and I could eat it again if I weren't paying so much for it. The meat was similar to Wendy's, and without the toppings, it lacked flavor.  The bottomless fries were okay, but the Campfire sauce makes them awesome. Tangy, creamy, and yummy.

If you just want a basic (cheese)burger and fries, which I did, then you should head to Portillo's.  If you want something more fancy then go to Red Robin. I'm not a fan of the ""endless fries"" here. You get a very small portion at first, and unless you really TRY to inhale the fries first, you probably won't get or need a second portion before you're finished or need a box for your burger. Of course this was me, and I felt like I did not get my money's worth. The fries are also a little too fat and mashy (?) in the middle for my tastes.  I like thinner fries that aren't as soft.

Ethan C.,"Oak Park, IL",30,14,,4.0,9/5/2012,"Red Robin's menu is basically an above average selection of burgers, sandwiches and wraps. As far as chain restaurants go, I would put it at the higher end in terms of quality. But the main reason I'm reviewing this location in Woodfield is to talk about how good the customer service is, along with the kid's meals. We've all heard that the teens and twentysomethings of today's generation are supposed to be pre-occupied with texting their friends on the Twitter and all that, but every single time I've taken my family to this location, no matter how busy and hectic this place is (and during the holiday's it's a madhouse) the hosts and servers at this location are always attentive, courteous and fast.  Also, if you have to take your kid to a chain restaurant, especially in a place like Woodfield, you really can't find a better selection of kid's meals. There's lots of healthy options for little ones, and they are tasty enough that your kid will actually want to eat them. And you might actually want to finish what they don't. I mean, I don't vulture on my kids food at all, but you might want to. Really good customer service, the best kids meals around, and they have Coke Zero in the fountain, which always gets extra credit from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=80

I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years.  The burger section of the menu was significantly smaller than I remember, but the other items (fish & chicken sandwiches, entrees) seemed to have grown. The burger was as I remembered it (I had the one with bleu cheese, chipotle bbq, and onion strings) and my mom tasted a new menu item, the cajun salmon sandwich.

Elizabeth W.,"Des Plaines, IL",276,332,179,3.0,4/9/2012,"Red Robin is a great place to take kids. Every time we come here, there are happy parents and their happy offspring putting away mouthfuls of food. Unlike some other Red Robin locations, though, the staff here seems to know how to organize high chairs and such to prevent a huge clog in the aisles. They even have birthday parties with balloons and other swag. I predict a lot of visits to this place in my future once my little one is big enough for a high chair herself. The staff here will not give you the stink eye because your kid drops a piece of food--they expect that and understand that your child might also leave little ketchup fingerprints on the table. It's clearly so popular with families for a reason. The food isn't bad, either. For a burgers and fries kind of place, they have pretty good selection and a fair number of healthier offerings. I love that I can opt to ""build a burger"" and get a boca vegan patty or gardenburger vegetarian patty and my choice of toppings and bun. Or, diners can opt to omit the bun and enjoy their burger ""protein style,"" wrapped in lettuce. For a small price increase, you can also get sweet potato fries here instead of regular french fries. I am always surprised by how good the sweet potato fries are here since so many places seem to screw them up somehow, usually either by not salting them at all or drowning them in brown sugar. They also offer more beer, shakes, and other beverages than you'd expect. One down side is that the service is pretty hit or miss. On some visits, I leave totally satisfied with the job our server did. Other times, we aren't offered a refill or more ""bottomless"" fries until we've finished eating and have been sitting there for a while--in other words, until it's too late. Sometimes things run smoothly, and we're in an out pretty fast, while other times we sit and wait for the check so long that we end up running late. Usually the servers are at least friendly and nice, but recently we had one who noticed my Cubs shirt and decided to rant at me about how much better the White Sox are while he had me captive. In addition to being rude and inappropriate, I was pregnant at the time and VERY HUNGRY. This guy was playing with fire--getting between a pregnant lady and her food is a dangerous game. He's lucky he didn't lose a hand. My husband was really annoyed that we had to wait for this guy to close his cakehole and give us our food, so he spoke with a manager about it, though we never heard back from the manager about whether he told the server to chill the hell out with that stuff. (Note to the server in question if you happen to read this--you might want to check out this video: And for the record, Zambrano had a no-hitter two seasons ago.) In short, sometimes we have a four or even five star experience here, but other times, Red Robin falls far short. This is a great place to go if you are looking for a burger joint that can feed a carnivore, a vegetarian, and a vegan or a group of children of various ages. For date night, go elsewhere, unless you think having to tell off a server is romantic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=80

We left and the manager came to us in the hall and offered free appetizers, after all we waited almost an hour which was about thirty mins more than they had told us and seated people before us..

I like the healthy options for the sides.  My kids love veggies so the carrots (choice of raw or steamed) and the broccoli are a hit with them. For the adults - the variety in the burgers is fantastic.  Our faves are the Royal Red Robin (egg on a burger is ingenious!), Mushroom, and Banzai Burger.  Never had a burger that wasn't cooked perfectly.  I get mine medium and it always has the perfect amount of pink.  The onion rings are awesome it's a regular appetizer for us. And who doesn't love endless steak fries?  We usually put a generous helping of the Red Robin seasoning on them, but they're good plain as well.  We've  been here often enough that I tell myself I have to try the other things on the menu (fish and chips, pastas, salads), but the burgers are so good that I have to stick with them...but one of these days I'll be able to write an update review on their other entrees! Definitely have to agree with the rave reviews on customer service at the Woodfield location.  Each and every time we've been here, the service has been outstanding no matter what time it is, busy or not.  Quick, friendly, and efficient service.  The manager also almost always does rounds at each table to ensure that things are running smoothly.  Food is served quickly and they really move tables without making you feel rushed.  About half the time we've been here, there's been a line (crowds being in Woodfield), but they always give you an accurate sense of wait time...and get you in when they say they will.

Theresa M.,"Chicago, IL",59,116,5,4.0,4/22/2009,"Went to Woodfield Mall on a Thursday. We were hungry and upon looking at the ""map"" of the place and deciding where to eat, I was surprised to see they had a Red Robin. The rest of my family had been to a more local one, without me, some time ago, so I was ready to try what they were talking about.  First off, I really like that this type of restaurant is IN the mall. Not to often you will find a burger joint. Usually only pizza or chinese restaurants or usual mall food court fair. Place was not crowded at all, and we were seated right away. They easily accommodated our fairly large party (2 adults,2 teens, 2 young girls and a baby in a high chair.) We had a stroller too, and they sat us at a seat that accommodated what really just turned into a rolling carrier for all our bags :) There is a sign posted outside the establishment that says that they only have a certain amount of tables to accommodate strollers..and they if they are all taken, they don't allow strollers in the restaurant. I can see how this might be an issue, because it is a little tight here and there, and I really could only see a few tables that would accommodate a stroller.  Okay.. the most important part...the FOOD. Kids Menu's first. Cheese pizza, ckn sticks, and pasta....all good according to the kids and generous sizes....moderatly priced. I like the multiple side options like mandarin oranges, side salad (which is really nice), etc.  Adult food. We all just basically got the Deluxe cheeseburger. Nicely put together and I like how they serve it -coming out of parchment paper. HOWEVER, maybe it was all the hype or this ""type"" of restaurant that would have led me to believe they served some awesome burger or something. It was good...don't get me wrong, but not SPECTACULAR. I've had lots better. My friend ordered the ""skinny"" version which was nice because it was a bit smaller and they take off $1 from the menu price. Fries are unlimited, and actually REALLY good. They are thicker cut, seasoned fries that were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed them!  I think I will try the BBQ burger that everyone always talks about, maybe I missed their ""signature"" sandwich!  DRINKS....well for a burger joint (well they do have pasta, and wraps and other sandwiches, but to me it just ""looks"" like a burger joint) I really like that they serve beer and drinks and stuff. I didn't get any...BUT they have fun non alcoholic drinks. Kids like the speckled lemonaide or something like that. It was good...but not as good as MY pomegranate blueberry limeaide with sprite (or whatever it was called). Kids were instantly jealous after tasting mine. Good thing it is free refills on all drinks including the fun ones. I liked that.  Over all a good place, good service, I wouldn't say that anything was outstanding, but I really liked the place and the food in general.

So me and the girls came for a fun filled day at woodfield and lo and behold....a Red Robin plopped right before my eyes.  The food is great, the prices are good, and best of all I always love the service we get. Our server last night as Daniel and he was excellent. He even graciously participated in our friendly wager. ( no he wasnt in on the wager) Us ladies decided to try and  guess his name and age (we were all wrong btw)  Overall... will we go back???  Hellz yeah.lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=140
Marina E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",67,532,1679,4.0,6/6/2009,"I haven't eaten at Red Robin in almost 6 years since there isn't one where I currently live.  When I ordered my old favorite, the turkey crossaint avocado and bacon sandwich....well it didn't fail to deliver.  The sandwich just about slapped me in the face.  It was that good.  I love Red Robin, the prices are reasonable and the service was extremely friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=140
Yvette C.,"Austin, TX",95,314,26,4.0,5/5/2008,The fries & the drinks are awesome. They even have a couple non-meat meals for us veg. Love it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=140
S to the izzo F.,"Elmhurst, IL",55,135,5,5.0,12/11/2006,Red Robin has a great burgers and Awesome Chicken sandwiches but better yet are the steak cut french fries with the Red Robin Seasoning.  if its been one of those days and you just don't care anymore about what you're putting in that temple you all call your body or when you want to just splurge on calories.  Hit Red Robin and get a thick milk shake to kick up your meals calorie count to like 3000 in one sitting. I love the food here but really can only eat it every once in a while.  I use it as my reward food when I attain certain goals.  Five star fast food!  Great drink Menu too.... their Bloody Mary Rocks! it Rocks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=140
Kevin C.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,21,,3.0,10/3/2011,Fun burgers and lackluster fries lead to a decent restaurant.  I've started to order their chicken sandwiches too and they are quite good.  It's a decent lunch and our group goes there once very two months or so.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=140
