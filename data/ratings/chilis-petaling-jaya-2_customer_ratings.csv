0,Jen L.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",101,343,431.0,4.0,2015-03-09,"Came here for my partner's birthday since he loves eating burger. He asked what burger to recommend and the waiter was being kind and said are you meat eater or less? My partner said meat eater then he introduced their signature burger i think and of course i ordered steak.  So his burger came and it was dripping with sauce and the sizzling patty that just came out of the oven made me even want one! He took his first bite and his in for more! One bite after another bite and he said ""This is better then Ben's"". I was enjoying my steak too with butter on top of it, i spread it into flat and ate with the mash potatoes.  The waiter came up to us and asked how is the food and my partner said ""SO GOOD!"".  I really love how the waiter interacts with us and also asked us if we want anything else. The lighting here is quite dim to take food photos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petaling-jaya-2,,,,,

It was dry, sometimes rubbery and feels like it was maybe microwaved (due to the dryness). I've had better pulled beef that's juicy elsewhere so will definitely not recommend the menu here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petaling-jaya-2,,,,,
