Jeniffer K.,"Torrance, CA",162,20,25,4.0,1/14/2018,"My friends and I came for lunch on Sunday. There wasn't a wait so we were seated right away. We ordered the smokehouse bbq tray -2 items (chicken crispers & half rack honey bbq chipotle ribs), ancho salmon, and the Santa Fe salad. It was perfect to share. I feel like if I just had one dosh there would have been something missing. It was enough greens from the salad and enough meat from the bbq tray!  The waitress was friendly but it was my cup of tea. She was friendly in the sense where she struck up a conversation but really, I just wanted to order and eat.... It would have been nice of it were cut short BUT that was her style so who's to say.  Our waters were filled & our stomachs full.    On a scale of zero to legit - it's legit - for what it is. It's not an upscale restaurant but it did it's job :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2
Sunako S.,"Gardena, CA",187,16,1,5.0,9/22/2017,"Yo this place was mad good, normally this spot can be iffy, but was bomb AF! Walked up no wait, but waited for a moment for the waiter. Grant's area was slammed, but took care of as soon as he could.  Order process was seamless, took a moment due to the ribs, but all came out hot.  Yo if other people reviews are keeping you from coming here it may have changed.  Good Food. Happy servers. Take home drinks.  Thanks GRANT!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2
Brian S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",66,16,2,3.0,1/14/2018,"Had the fajitas special and is a good deal for the promotional price of $10.99. But honestly  if we would of paid regular price we would of been disappointed. Steak is chewy and fatty and low quality meat.

Helen H.,"Torrance, CA",1208,107,623,4.0,12/3/2017,"Needing to fulfill your craving for Tex-Mex food? Gucaumole craving? If you come at lunchtime you can satisfy those cravings at a good price. Solid good food, friendly staff, lively loud environment. A fun place, just a little too loud for me, during peak hours. Ribs and a variety of BBQ meats are the stars here. Great meat, through out the menu, as entress, in  sandwiches, sliders, nachos and even in appetizers. They have great salads for your veggie friends. The jalapeño chicken enchiladas are hit, spicy and yummy....my current favorites. I also love their soups. They have great deals 2 for $20, 2 for $29 and other specials. Sometimes sharing makes the meal all the more delish.  Don't neglect the desserts, as they have a wicked, yummy way with chocolate. Give in to the chocolate, it's worth the calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2
Jennifer W.,"Chino, CA",419,64,26,3.0,12/17/2017,"I like coming here for a quick lunch on Sundays.  The only way is to sit at the bar, watch sports, down the soup and salad and be on my way!  Potato cheese  soup is the BEST.  I love that there was one seat left at the bar when I got here because I would've had to leave hungry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2
Mark M.,"Torrance, CA",36,336,1095,3.0,2/18/2017,"Torrance Food Crawl #121 Not sure why it was so busy today, perhaps people wanted to get out of their houses because of all the recent rain. Evidently there was a going to be a wait for a table but there was a spot in the bar area available, so bar here I come. There was a tablet kiosk on the table which seemed to have lots of options but no option to order food. The server came by shortly and I ordered from the paper menu. The Grass-Fed Sunrise Burger is one of their new 'craft' burgers. It comes with a beef patty, from cattle that were presumably grass fed. There is a ""cage-free fried egg"" on top of the patty, sunny side up, and presumably it was the chicken that was raised cage free and not the fried egg. In addition there was pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and 'Chili's Signature sauce'. The first bite into the burger left egg yolk running down my hand, a bit of a mess. I can't really use the right words here but the total effect was the creation of an average burger. It just doesn't end up being that special. Good, but not great. French Fries were served in a metal basket. They were a little on the salty side, for my taste. The server was conscientious to the point that when she noticed my Diet Coke was down about one inch came out with a second one, perhaps just anticipating that I would eventually want more soda. The bar area has lots of televisions tuned to sporting events. It was quite noisy at first, especially the ladies near me who had been drinking a bit, but the noise level eventually settled down to a more acceptable level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2

Our waitress was very friendly, but because she had several tables to assist we rarely saw her. I ordered the chipotle strips with corn on the cob and fries. My first bite into the corn was rock solid and very cold! The waitress stated that they had just taken it out the freezer, and probably didn't warm it up long enough. What?!

Jeff M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/29/2017,"We have been very kind to this Chili's location despite their horrible food that they have severed us form time to time. We have never complained BUT tonight it was so bad that I have to speak up. we ordered the dinner special for 2 for $22. I ordered chicken fajitas and my son ordered Hamburger. My chicken fajitas was OLD DEAD CHICKEN microwaved. It smelled like hell. My son's Hamburger was so bad that he could not finish it. BTW, My son loves Hamburger. He eats any kind of Hamburger. Imagine how bad his hamburger was that he could not finish it.  The manager comes over and he apologized for the Microwaved Dead Chicken and he admits how horrible my food was. I asked him to charge us for the drinks and we will go to In-N-Out. Hold and be-hold the bill arrives with 50% discount. That's where I lost it. Not only the people in the kitchen are worthless but the manager is too. Now I know what is wrong. THEY DON'T CARE. they finally only charged us for the drinks and we left.

I got a drink at the bar while we waited. Arrived at 5, got a table at 6. Apparently, though taking our information, they forgot about us entirely.  My father got angry but there was a couple who moved for us just to be nice, so while we sat down another waitress who wasn't our own made a comment, ""well you're messing up our table numbers"". We didn't steal a seat, they were seating us when the couple wanted to move to a bigger table so we all agreed to switch.  Our server was nice, I believe her name was... tally? So sorry if I butchered it. We ordered our food but it took 40 minutes for us to receive it.  Apart from our one server, the staff was extremely rude.

Like NO...really, you have to check it out! I visited during lunch time around 12 noon, wasn't crowded at all. Found parking right in front. Came with my family, party of 4. We ordered off the lunch menu, $8 and less. I had chicken fajitas with a side of salad. Very good and just enough to fill me up until dinner time.  They gave you a choice of chilli or salad with your lunch order and my whole family ordered chili (except for me) and each one asked for a side of tortilla strips. Our waitress made it a point to add in that they don't usually give them out with chilli ""just so you don't expect them next time"" (her words, not mines). I thought it was a little snarky but it didn't take away from how good my meal and drinks were (yes I had multiple tito punches lol) I would certainly come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=20

I understand she was tired, but geez lady, would it kill you to crack a smile? Her customer service was garbage. On the bright side, the nice young woman with purple hair was extremely NICE and COMPASSIONATE enough to ask me how was my day. There were also male workers who gave me proper customer service.

Great hospitality , lively inside , I think it was past Saturday. So all was up beat.  So why the 2 star???  The menu is absolutely the death of people.  They have a light section of 6-8 items and everything , yes everything else will clog your body. It's sad to say, but these type of menus should be illegal.   How can chains sell this crap, people are simply not giving s moment about the fat, sodium , and calories they throw down.

He answered the phone right away, was pleasant on the phone, got my order right, and did it all with a smile in the middle of the chaos. If I had a restaurant, I would want everyone to work as hard as I saw him today. As for everything else, when I walked in today, I waited at the hostess stand for 5 minutes and was not even acknowledged by anyone. I then called, on my cell, from the hostess stand, and William answered and directed me to the Take Out window. The food was very average.

Cher M.,"CA, CA",28,133,414,5.0,11/1/2016,"This review is for the service because I've always known the food was good. My friends and I decided to go for an early dinner on October 29, I wanted to try their ""3 For Me"" deal. Our server was Stefan, and a trainee. We got there about 4p m waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated because they were already busy. But the wait time really wasn't bad. After being seated we were immediately greeted by the server. I asked about the special because it wasn't on the menu. After explaining it I knew exactly what I wanted. I got the chicken fajita 3 for me deal and my one friend got the mix and match fajita shrimp and steak. She always gets the same thing. My other friend got the chicken crispers. Now my friend that ordered the mix and match is allergic to cilantro and onions make her sick so when ordering she requested only bell peppers and to add jalapenos. About 10 minutes later the server returned to announce that unfortunately the cook made the mix and match with both cilantro and onions but he caught it and had them remake it. He brought her some chips and salsa to make up for the mistake. She was ok with that. 10 minutes later he brought her meal out. After leaving it she noticed it still had cilantro and onions. She called him over and we could see he felt terrible,  he apologized profusely and offered to remake it again. She said no that she would eat around it she was hungry. He offered to remove the meal from the bill and offered a free desert of her choice which eased her annoyance alot. He was very attentive and on top of it. Sadly the cooks were not. So she was happy about how he handled it. I loved my mini fajita it was the perfect size. As I mentioned I love the food here but I wanted to give Stefan a shout out because he handled the mix up well. We will be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=20

Albert M.,"Torrance, CA",98,88,96,1.0,1/3/2016,"Chili's, you need to get your act together. The service was bad from the waitress with loops in her ears. Things started out pretty good but then long waits, I am talking like 15 minutes before returning. She didn't check on things. She didn't bring the soup or salad before the food. We had to ask. Let's back the chili pepper up a bit. Even when we got seated the first lady that took us to the table didn't even wait for us to sit down. The reason why I say that is the seat was dirty with food and crumbs. I will give them credit, the cup if chili was actually good. They did bring an extra dressing for the salad. The chili did have a lot if cheese grated on top. Bravo. The plate that the ribs were served on was dirty with stuck on cilantro and the edge was greasy or burnt cheese. Now that I think about it my fork was dirty. The salad was not crisp. It looked like it was old. The corn on the cob was just plain cold. It looks all smashed, mushy, and dry to boot. She took my straw when bringing a new glass with a refill. The new smoked chicken burrito was so plain I couldn't taste any of the advertised sauce. The chicken was just so soft I wondered how it was supposed to be grilled. I had to put my chili on the burrito to spice it up. I tried to ask for hot sauce but the server did not return for so long. Once again a long wait for the bill. I wanted to get out of there!

A few personal favorite are the Texas Cheese fries (LOVE) and the Cajun Chicken Pasta! My boyfriend enjoys both the steak and ribs.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,3.0,11/19/2014,"My experience at this Chili's has been rather hit-and-miss. The first time I went was for lunch on a Sunday; the eatery wasn't crowded and we experienced prompt service and great food. When I went once on a Saturday night for dinner, the restaurant was packed and service was a bit slower, but it wasn't bad. However, on a different Saturday when I went for dinner with a group of people, we experienced the worst service ever -- I don't think we even left a tip that night. Our waitress filled one of our water glasses only halfway because she ran out of water in her pitcher ... and she didn't return! We had to flag her down to ask for more water (as well as for our other needs). Not cool.   However, I have to say that the food quality has been consistent at this location, so though I don't know what to expect now when it comes to service, I can pretty much be safe that my usual entrees and desserts will be good.   Here are some of my favorites when it comes to ordering at Chili's:   ""Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet"": This Pizookie knock-off was delicious, and I usually opt for this sweet treat whenever I need a break from my usual ""Molten Cake"" order. This dessert features a soft, warm, chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven--served in one of those iron skillets--and it's topped with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. I think I've had a peanut butter version of this cookie before, which was amazing, but the chocolate chip version is still good. The cookies I've received have always been soft and tender, pairing perfectly with the luscious vanilla ice cream and warm hot fudge.  ""Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich"": If I'm in the mood to order a sandwich at Chili's, I go for this savory combo. The ""Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich"" features crispy chicken (same as the chicken in the ""Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad"") topped with spicy Buffalo sauce, a fresh-sliced tomato, lettuce and the eatery's homemade ranch dressing. The sandwich is served with French Fries; I love the extra saltiness the fries at Chili's seem to have. I can only handle mildly spicy dishes, so this sandwich was pushing it for me (I had to drink lots of water during/after my meal), but I enjoyed it nonetheless!   ""Seasonal Desserts"": Be on the lookout for current, seasonal offerings at Chili's, because some of these limited-time specials have been some of my favorites. The ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten"" in particular is noteworthy--I wish it were a regular on the restaurant menu. It's probably my favorite molten. This ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten"" featured a moist peanut butter-chocolate molten cake topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel sauce drizzles. Generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups--my favorite candy--topped off this dessert. And, of course, a melted peanut butter center was at the cake's core. This is simply chocolate-peanut butter heaven.  ""Southwestern Mac 'n' Cheese"": Though this dish is just a side, it might be worth substituting for one of the other sides in your entrée (slight extra fee) or just ordering on the side if you're a serious mac 'n cheese lover. This dish is definitely heavy on the cheese (the macaroni itself is cheesy, with the cheese oozing out of every bite) and the breadcrumbs on top add extra savoriness. It's one of my favorite mac 'n cheeses.  ""Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad"": This salad is my go-to entrée at Chili's, as it's one of my favorite salads ever. It features a medley of wild greens (spring mix), crispy boneless chicken tossed in the eatery's spicy Buffalo sauce, applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, homemade pico de gallo, crispy tortilla strips and homemade ranch dressing. I always get this salad without pico and with extra bleu cheese crumbles (I love my cheese). I also ask for the dressing on the side (I've found that, if you do, you'll sometimes end up with more dressing). I've noticed also that, in recent years, the greens in this salad are now a spring mix/wild greens ... and though they aren't my favorite (I don't like the bitter purple lettuce), the toppings on this salad--the strongly flavored bleu cheese with the mildly spicy boneless chicken strips--are worth it.  ""Molten Chocolate Cake"": When there isn't a seasonal ""Molten Cake"" that I want to try, this ""Molten Chocolate Cake"" always gets my dessert vote. It features a moist, warm chocolate cake with a melted chocolate center and is topped with vanilla ice cream surrounded by a thin chocolate shell. The contradicting mixtures in this one dessert make it so fun (and challenging) to eat. I always enjoy sopping up the cake pieces in the gooey chocolate mixture oozing out from the center, while trying to simultaneously eat the ice cream and hard chocolate topping without the ice cream melting completely because of the cake's warmth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=40

I ordered the Smokehouse combo with the 1/2 baby back ribs and the crispy chicken that was so crispy it was a little hard to chew. The ribs did not taste like I remember and were sort of dry and overcooked the sauce was terrible. I brought to my waitress attention and she apologized and said she will have them do better next time. First of all will it be a next time? Will I get you for a waitress next time?

M. D.,"Claremont, CA",28,176,149,2.0,2/10/2017,"Chili's overall is an ok middle of the road type place, and although the service is friendly it's s-l-o-w as molasses at this location. Seriously, we started with our drink orders and it looked promising since our server told us there would be three people taking care of us, but we only saw the initial guy for the first 40 minutes or so and only very briefly. It took forever to get the first round of drinks (water, soda and iced tea) so as soon as they came we insisted on ordering our food right then.  At other locations our appetizers come out very quickly, but at this one after 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to check on them. Chips and salsa has always come out instantly at other locations, but not here.  Also, some of us ordered alcoholic drinks when the server brought our water but those took forever as well and when they finally arrived, they did not bring straws so we waited for another several minutes before I just got up and asked another server for some. You would think the straws were made of gold or something because at first he refused to give us any. He kept telling us they were in our little packet, but I had to explain a few times that we all got water and other drinks and we used our straws for those, then I kept thinking, why the heck is this an issue?!?!  When he finally relented and pulled some straws from the pack around his waist, they looked like they had been in there for months. The ends were black with dirt and holey and as I recoiled from them, I asked if we could please get some that were not partially open. I figured he could see the dirty part without me having to point that out (but I guess you never know!).  So who knows how much later, we finally started getting our entrees. In our party of eight, four of us ordered fajitas. Only one of us got sour cream on our little condiment boat so guess what took even more time? Waiting for that damn sour cream, so we looked around and tried to see if there was literally anything else we might need so we could ask for it now in hopes that we would get it before we were done. Yes, it was that bad. Also, pro tip here. If you are getting the 2 for $22 and you want chips and salsa, order the guacamole and chips instead. You'll get the guac, the salsa and the chips. Trust me, someone will eat it and it's not costing you any more. I will still eat at Chili's from time to time, but definitely not at this location.

Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1680,1066,6642,3.0,6/28/2013,"Chili's offers a good $20 dinner for 2. For $20, you pick an appetizer to share and two full sized entrees!  This $20 deal is not bad because you have a choice of selecting from their new offerings or picking old favorites! When I came here with a friend, we decided to try out some of their new offerings! For the appetizer to share we tried the chipotle chicken flatbread and for our entrees, we each got from the new ""lighter choices"". I got the mango-chile chicken and my friend got the mango-chile tilapia. The appetizer was served first and my friend The flatbread is made fresh right after you order and so it comes out nicely toasted and warm! The flatbread was a nice starter! It was not too heavy but yet very tasty. From the tender chicken toppings to the chipotle pesto sauce to the three different cheeses (cheddar, monteray jack, mozarealla) to the pico de gallo and tomato sauce, this was one ok flatbread. Our ""lighter choice"" dishes were served next. I love that Chili's is offering these lower calorie, healthy meals at just the right portions! My mango-chile chicken dish may have been light but just like the menu stated, it had the ""same bold Chili's taste!"" The chicken was seasoned with a sweet Chile sauce and topped with spicy mango vinaigrette, pico de gallo and avocado. It was served with rice and steamed broccoli.

Zach G.,"Gardena, CA",63,220,696,3.0,3/9/2015,"Came here this past weekend out of a fit of desperation. First time I'd been to a Chili's in years! Annnnd it pretty much hasn't changed, except they no longer sell/serve the Awesome Blossom! That was probably the best thing in the menu! Apparently they stopped it in 2008.. So that leads me to believe they've been lame for about 7 years now. All jokes aside, the food was alright, and the price was right.... We Ordered the 2 for $20 lunch/dinner special. It comes with an appetizer and two entrees. We ordered the guac and chips. Guac was good, a little to chunky for my taste. The salsa it comes with is a shame, pure salt. The chips may be made in house, or they just serve em' warm. We got a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings and chicken strips with fries. Their sides are a decent size, the onion rings are anyway. My daughter had, a quesadilla, with mashed potatoes and a chocolate milk, gross I know, but she's 7 so it makes sense to her. .. The food came out promptly, our server was kinda mia after that. We ordered another order of fries and he showed at the table to give us the check and then remembered we never got the fries. We didn't even want em' anymore but it's not a huge deal, so yeah.  All in all $36. No too bad for 3 peeps. We had to waited maybe ten minutes to be seated, which is to be expected on a busy Saturday during the lunch rush. -1 because they don't have the awesome blossom and -1 because of the whole fry/MIA mishap.  P.S. - Every table now has a Ziosk. It's like an ipaddy thing which your kid can use to play games, or you can use to browse the menu and pay the tab.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=80

Patrick S.,"Torrance, CA",1546,415,1739,3.0,7/30/2015,"Stopped in here for a quick lunch, ive gone a few times to this location and I like the food. But ive not been in a long time. They changed the menu and have some good looking food on it. Place was not busy, but for some reason the waiter took about 10 minutes to show up. No big deal, but then I placed the order for me and my little girl and it took another 10 minutes to get my drink. And my girls drink didn't come out until after the food came. Not sure why, milk pretty easy to serve. Anyway, got our food and it was served hot. Everything seemed fresh and tasted good. She got the mac n cheese with steamed vegg. I got the chicken quesadilla salad, it was good. Then we sat there for a while and no waiter. Not sure what he was doing , but I didn't even see him walking around. Someone else came by and had to ask us for desert, or the bill. So other than the poor service, food was good and place was clean and nice.

Jennifer V.,"Harbor City, CA",32,11,2,5.0,1/7/2017,"I normally don't write reviews but tonight really prompted my to share with my fellow yelpers.  I made reservations for 7:30pm, when we checked in they didn't have a record of my reservation. The guys at the front was pretty helpful and said he would write us down and try to seat us soon. After waiting 30 minutes, we asked again and someone who seemed like the manager said she would look and see what she could do. After another 20 minutes, we were getting ready to leave. We were a party of 8 with 3 young kids who were getting very hangry. Finally we got seated, but most of our party was not happy. I felt sorry for the person who would get stuck as our server. Our servers name was Cameron and she came in like a ray of sunshine. While some of our party started to give her some attitude, she was a great sport.  Apologizing for our wait, but not making excuses.  She was friendly and attentive, helpful in suggesting menu items and  prompt on the refills (which is my pet peeve). I don't know if we were hungry, but the food was great and super affordable. Their prices were definitely better than most.  So what looked like was going to be a debacle of a night, turned out great.  At then end of the night, our whole party was enjoying the food and all was forgotten.

ChrisCotton A.,"San Pedro, CA",54,3,,1.0,2/19/2017,"First off, let me mention that I am a former chef who is still currently Servesafe Manager Certified....meaning I am well versed in sanitation. I went to chili's on 2/27/27 with my wife and daughter for dinner. I got the choose 3 meats dinner... Ribs, chicken crispers, links accompanied with the corn, fries and Texas toast. I had an Angry Apple Orchard beer. First of all, it took way too long to get a beer that was flat and and warm.... After waiting a while for our food, one would imagine it would at least be hot.. This was not the case. My ribs were dry and appeared to have been sitting much like a poorly executed banquets set up. The corn was dried out to where you could see the husk of the corn through the collection of kernels. This link that had cheese in it which seemed like a good idea at when I ordered it. Not to mention I didn't even get my fries that came with the order. I had to tell another server about it since mine obviously had to cover a large section by himself. Usually, I take it in stride since I'm a former industry guys, but that night around 12 I woke up having to Run to the bathtoom. I was vometing and suffering from diarrhea... Not to go into great detail about those symptoms, I experienced this all day. I ended up going to urgent care. I was placed on an IV from dehydration, a nausea medication and limited diet. And yes, Chili's was the only thing I had eaten before this happened. My body was in major pain from using the bathroom and all the dry heaving and vometing. I will be looking to escelate this to corporate because getting  food poisoning is a true sign of Zero integrity in the kitchen!

Try the Parmesan Crusted Steak with the Loaded Mashed Potatoes. Also, the Chipotle Chicken Crispers are really good. Tip: try to avoid Saturday evenings. We went on a Saturday around 7 pm.

I asked to speak to the manager & when she came she apologized again & I asked her about the area that was closed & she said that we could be seated over there.

Surroundings?  When this place gets busy it can get super loud.  I mean loud.  That's probably why I don't go so often.  It's located on the end of a small strip mall.  I wouldn't even call it a mall because there are only like 3 other businesses (if that).  I think one is a Subway.  Anyway, it's located right across the street from Del Amo Mall.  There is plenty of parking so that is never an issue.  It can get crowded at times and you'll see people waiting outside.  I'm not one to wait for any place so when I see that, I just go somewhere else.  If you've never been, Chili's as a bar-type setting and a regular sit-down restaurant area.  In the bar area they have a few overhead TV's.  When you walk in the door, there is a good sized waiting area with nice big comfy seats.  The place has a nice darker interior making it feel more relaxing.  Walk up to the stand and someone will seat you.  Try to get seat away from the group tables because that is where the noise will be coming from more than likely.  Most of the tables are booth style with a few table and chair setups. I'm not really a fan of their overall menu, but I do think they make a great burger and that's what I typically order.  I've always had good food here, but then I can't really comment on most of the other menu items.  I've never had an issue with the servers even when they're busy.  They tend to help each other out, which is a good thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=100

We had to savor our drink just so it could last throughout our meals. Our food took an extreme amount of time to get to us, which of course bothered. I got the Cajun pasta and it was cold and barely had Alfredo sauce. And to end our ""lovely"" visit, I thought I'd get a chocolate molten cake to make the night better, but no, my cake was over-cooked so I had no gooey chocolate inside AND it was cold.

Their beer selection is not very good, either, but I am used to 'craft beer' places or at the very very least something like a Sierra Nevada or Stella Artois... Service: The bar area was moderately busy, but our two servers worked hard and were quite good and friendly.  Food: The bacon burger was overcooked (definitely past well-done).

He would go around the other wall divider as to not walk by our table to get to the other table he was waiting on. Which was 3 tables from of us.  The food was meh... Nothing special. I just had a craving for chicken enchilada soup that's why I came here.  Not worth it! My daughters broccoli was black on the stems too! My salad cucumbers were half clear, yes clear (like gel) which means they were old.  I will not be coming back...ever. It wasn't worth complaining to management.

The floors were so filthy- broom anyone? Dear Santa, please provide a broom and dustpan to Chili's. Once the girl did come over, she basically pointed me to their new little help-yourself touch screen machine on the table which commercials show looking very handy and cool- in real life- a total waste...especially when the server and every staff member are ""out to lunch"". She never offered to refill our drinks or ask if the food was ok. I ordered the southwestern egg rolls which I have ordered many times before (long ago) and it was the saddest plate of food I've ever seen. I'm posting a pic btw. The plate wasn't properly garnished- I think the cooks were outside in the back smoking or something because they sure as heck weren't cooking or focused on quality or presentation.  I actually got up and went to the little server station and helped myself to silverware etc since the girl never did bring what we asked for. Gee, should I have put on an apron too?  NEWSFLASH f & b employees- when you have guests in your establishment- you must provide the same high quality of service and product when you open, at the busiest time of day, and for the very last table seated.

It wasn't very cheesy and the flavor was just not great overall.  The other HH appetizers are great though. The southwestern eggrolls and the pretzel sticks are probably my favorites. The boneless chicken wings were surprisingly quite good and the mozzarella sticks (Fried Cheese) was very tasty. I've liked nearly everything I've had on the HH menu other than the queso.  Margaritas are great and $5 each. Mango and raspberry fresh margaritas are really yummy! The blue one that's $5.99 is very good too. My friend had the tropical one which was a pineapple juice blend. Very good! 4 stars for food and great HH prices. 2 stars for service.  The service at this particular location was not very good, unfortunately. It wasn't awful but it was definitely slow.

Safe to say this place is losing alot of good paying customers quickly... We went here during a weekday a few weeks back to have drinks and just some late night conversation. Closing time was probably in an hour and the bar was fairly empty so we had plenty of time. We had a young black waitress who was really nice..almost a little too nice. While we were seated she kept having pretty inappropriate conversation with the two older gentleman behind us including showing her Facebook page & other things I'd rather not say on Yelp... When we got our food (girlfriend order enchiladas & I ordered shrimp tacos), our places were COMPLETELY covered in grease! SInce our plates both came with rice it was clear they cooked the majority of all the food in the same batch of grease. Here comes the worse part.. When we told our waitress about the problem (we had a napkin soaked clearly in nothing but grease), she stated she would get the manager. We were confused as to why? We just didn't want the order we just wanted to return the plate. The manger came over and made the one statement that will be the reason I will never eat at this particular Chili's again.. ""So did you need another reason for your order?"" Excuse the f**k out of me??? Are you asking me why I need a reason to return an order that was clearly cooked poorly????? Luckily I was in the bathroom when he came otherwise they would have needed 911. He gave my girlfriend attitude until I got back. He told her ""Well we cook our enchiladas in grease and this is how they normally come"". Umm no, we have had this dish several times and its NEVER looked that bad. You can also cook enchiladas without grease as well. He finally tucked in his pride and said I'm sorry after a few more verbal jabs. We had to wait several minutes for the order to be taken off the bill before we finally could leave. We went to somewhere we know the service is always the same: In-N-Out I am sadly disappointed. I have only decided to start doing reviews after having several recent incidents like this.

First off, I feel like there was only one waiter managing the tables in the bar section. The rest of the restaurant was almost empty, I think I saw one family sitting down in the dine in area. If it's full in the bar, why can't other waiters help out? So of course our waiter Zach is getting piled with orders and refills and forgetting this and that. So what happened was we asked if we can have extra sour cream for our nachos and he tells us it's .90 extra, it was really .80 extra but anyways we agreed because we still wanted it. Well he gets side tracked and passes us more than 5 times and even tells us once while passing by us that he's gunna get our sour cream. We waited for ten minutes for the sour cream and when we get it, it is the smallest dollop of sour cream I couldn't even believe it. I was led to believe that since we were paying almost a dollar extra that we would get almost a whole side of sour cream. No, we were wrong. The sour cream came in the same small container the ranch comes in. I was so disappointed that at that point I didn't even feel like finishing my food.

Its a pico de gallo style, but a little liquidy so the tomatos dont get dried out.  Bonless buffalo wings are always a delight.  I usually get the burgers, but in the past Ive gotten the chicken pasta dishes...previously never cared for the baby back ribs, always thought of them to be a bit dry (just my preference), but the last time I went I did order, and I was impressed as they were good...they obviously changed the style of cooking as they are truly fall off the bone, more similar to Outback Steakhouse...I also like how they're constantly updating their menu, leaning more to the craft burgers given the surge in gastropubs...I appreciate that in a chain restaurant...really looking to see whats popular and providing a constant change on selections to their customers...kudos.

Although I appreciate the fact they tried and even comped me a soft drink I am not a happy camper. I mentioned, as my food was handed to me, that it's clearly cold. He offered to heat it up (how do you heat up a Club Sandwich?) the onion rings were cold  and the bacon wayyyy under cooked. Anyway, as the minutes tick..I'm starving!

Samantha A.,"Lakewood, CA",42,5,2,1.0,9/13/2015,"UNLESS YOU LIKE TO EAT MOLD...DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! I am usually not one to complain when dining out but today was the absolute exception. My fiancé and I went to this location for dinner today and had the worst experience. We started off with drinks (he had an unsweetened Iced tea and I ordered a Grapefruit Margarita) and appetizers (chips and salsa & cheese fries). We got the drinks first then the chips and salsa. We were starving so it went fast especially the salsa. Our server disappeared so we didn't get a chance to ask for more. Another server brought out our cheese fries so we asked him to bring another order of chips and salsa but he told us he'd tell our server. We waited and nothing came. The Texas cheese fries were good but certainly were starting to get cold. The fries weren't fresh and the cheese was already solid. I let that go. But then our entrees came. We both ordered steak medium rare. When we got our orders my finance's was clearly well done and mine was medium. When our server finally reappeared she asked us how everything was. My fiancé told her his steak was overcooked but declined to have another one re-cooked and just told her as an FYI. He asked for A1 sauce. Halfway through my meal I noticed that at the bottom of the broccoli stems there was black spotted mold covering the bottoms. I quickly stopped eating and my fiancé asked to speak to a manager. A young man came over and we explained the steak and my broccoli. He offered to have them re-done or if we wanted to order something else. I had lost my appetite by then so we declined. He took away our entrees and soon after the waitress came over and brought us a bill. My fiancé was livid that we were still expected to pay for the rest of the meal after that disgusting moldy broccoli. We asked our server for the manager and instead of the same guy it was another woman with glasses. She came over asking if she can help us with a smart attitude straight off the bat. We had to explain the entire situation again and she preceded to tell me that they get their produce delivered fresh everyday. Her tone was very matter-of-fact and she did not bother to examine the plate that we had returned. I was livid! I told her I have seen moldy vegetables in my life and that broccoli was not fresh! She then began to barrage us with her reasoning behind charging us for the rest of our meal. Stating we had enjoyed everything else and if we wanted another steak entree in exchange she would have to charge us. Why the hell would you try charging us for this incredibly disgusting experience and make us feel like we were lying about their bad produce. I could not take any more of her rude tone and her unprofessional way of handling the whole situation. I felt extremely dissatisfied as a long time customer and would have preferred better treatment from this ""manager."" She was not understanding or personable at all. Obviously she needs a whole lot of lessons on how to listen and respect her customers. We tried to be as calm about the situation but she made that impossible. I paid off the bill and walked out. I told her that she was completely rude. I have never had such an experience with a so-called manager.

But this one take out experience ruined it for me and I doubt we'll return. First of all, I thought it was curbside pickup (like they bring it to you). I guess I was mistaken but I have a baby so I was hoping this would be convenient. So I had to go inside, fine. I lugged the 25+ lb car seat inside. The pickup is all the way in the back of the bar area. I had 2 entrees and 2 drinks. The girl rings me up and opens the food to check it. My friends entree (lunch sliders and fries) literally had 5 fries. Even the girl was a little surprised and mumbled something about the box being too big. I even asked her if she was SURE that's all the fries I get. Her response was ""the manager packed it. If she packed it she would have given me more fries."" Ok. Yet she didn't do anything about it. So now I have a carseat, a bag of food, and 2 drinks. No one offers to help me so I had to make 2 trips, one to drop off the baby in the car and actually leave him in there while I run back for the drinks. It was 15 seconds sure but a little help would have been nice avoided me leaving him. I was so embarrassed bringing lunch to my friend with the 5 fries. I actually apologized for it. I spent $25 for 2 crappy entrees and wished I'd gone to in n out instead for half the price. They sent me $20 in vouchers which I do appreciate but after that fiasco I'm not sure I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=160

I never really have that much of a problem with the service except for our most recent visit. They were fairly busy around 2:30pm on a Friday due to numerous big parties, however, we felt like we were being completely ignored. Being as I have worked in the food industry, I completely understand that at times it does get hectic. Therefore, we didn't order anything crazy just a few lunch specials. I got the soup and salad lunch combo which took a half an hour to get except the other person I was with got his salad fairly quickly after ordering. By that time, we were starving and dug right in. Only problem is, trying to track down someone to get a napkin was another story. When they did sit us they let us know that we will be having 3 different people helping us out. Cool. BUT we never even saw the one server that took our order again after actually taking our order. Trying to get someone's attention to get a napkin was a task on its own. We finally got someone that helped us out and apologized for the lack of attention and helped us out. Once we got our check, it was wrong of course. If I were the server, I would have made sure that I took care of the customers and even went out of their way to get a manager involved.

We weren't offered, but should have taken the hint.  The wait staff all seemed busy with a lot of large groups; we got greeted then left to sit.  The manager saw that we were just sitting there, so took our order and fast tracked it ahead of the groups.

The Southwest(?) burger and fries looked good and was fresh and hot.  The wife's soup was only warm, the salad looked good, but nothing extraordinary.  We were done in another 15 and tried to use the on-table screen to check out--and found a 99 cent charge for table entertainment (games). We had scrolled through the food menus while waiting and saw that games were available. But, didn't see any warning about a charge until AFTER hitting the play button, at which time we backed out of that screen, without playing. So, another wait while the waitress had the  manager remove the charge.  Beware of getting sucked in to that charge! It should be free, to fill the wait time (hint!)

Hmmmm...that is something to think about. Maybe next time,  I won't order food - just the CCPP dessert.  That might even things out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=180

I grew up going to Chili's on the east coast and this was my first Chili's experience on the west coast. I went for an early dinner on a Sunday, and they had the game on TV even in the dining area, not just the bar, so that was cool. Chili's food is consistently good, particularly their burgers. You always know what you're going to get, and I like that. It's obviously not a gourmet restaurant or anything, but it's good food you can count on. The reason I had to give it all 5 stars is because of the superb service. I dine out frequently and received service here that was far better than service I've had in fancy schmantsy restaurants. Our waiter was so personable and friendly, and it was evident that he was working hard. He went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. He was personable and made good conversation with us, always refilled our drinks, and brought out extra chips for our dip without us having to ask. Seriously, I was so pleasantly surprised by how great the service was. If I'm in the mood for Chili's again, I would absolutely return to this location and with any luck get the same great server!

I usually eat the steak with broccoli but this time I had the burger. It was fantastic and came out very hot. #2 friendly team service from the hostess to my server. Maybe they treat me special because I work at the nearby computer store and was wearing my uniform. In short, the staff here acts like they come from a speciality restaurant.  #3 food comes out fast. I appreciate that as I'm usually pretty hungry.  # 4 they don't object to substitutions like veggies instead of fries. (The broccoli here is delicious). Also, I asked to have my burger cut in half and put in a to-go container when I ordered and they happily obliged.

Tender, Juicy not rubbery or overcooked and they were medium shrimps not those nasty bay shrimps. The slaw was good and not too much. I used ranch on my tacos.  My B.F. had the ribs and they were tender (a bit cold) but good.  We loved the black beans. They were rich and spicy! Placed order on line and called to be sure it was received. Phone answered quickly and the to-go desk had my order. So far so good.  Arrived within the 15 minute time frame to find my order ready and waiting for me. This time the female server  at the to-go area was as quick as a whip and really had it together. She added some extra ranch dipping sauce and was courteous and quick. She also shooed out some of the lingering waiters who were just hanging out in the area she told them ""you are in my work space"" ! I thought this was a crack up but she is definitely efficient. Sorry I did not get her name but she was working on Saturday 12/3 about 4pm.  I hope she stays because she is obviously a hard worker and someone who cares about getting the food right and efficiently to her patrons.

Kay S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",17,58,4,2.0,12/29/2009,"My review here is based solely on service/atmosphere of this specific Chili's. I love Chili's food, for the most part and I eat there maybe twice a year. Unfortunately the last two times have been at this location and both times I've had horrible, slow service.  Today my appetizer came in two parts. Three eggrolls came and after we ate them, our waiter said that the kitchen forgot an eggroll. Uh...okay. So by the time we were almost finished eating he brought out one eggroll. So random. I think he would have done better just not telling us and comping the app (or just not saying anything since we hadn't even noticed).

Shinobu K.,"Torrance, CA",22,160,150,4.0,10/9/2009,"Okay, I'm struggling to be a burger snob and say the burgers at this chain bar 'n grill are lame-o, but I just had what they now call an Old Timer, with bacon and cheese, and I must say, it was a pretty good burger.  I'm all smiley. Bacon and cheese a little greasy, but smiley. Served with fries and the lettuce, pickles and tomato on the side, along with a few sliced jalapeños, I ordered it medium well, and it came with a nice crust and a tasty patty.  Even the bun was tasty. I've been coming to this Chili's for almost 10 years now, and have tried a bunch of stuff over the years, some stuff on the salty side, some stuff on the mediocre side and some stuff..., remember the Triple Play (I think that's what they called it, deep fried everything on a plate and then deep fry the plate - wings, chicken strips, eggrolls,) boy do I love dippity dipping, but later my heart would hurt.  Service has always been decent to fun to great, food's pretty consistent, place is generally clean.

Tahneetra C.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",553,14,1,1.0,12/6/2013,"My family just tried to enjoy a nice Friday evening dinner at Chili's. I am truly shocked by the poor customer service and quality of food we just experienced.  Let's begin with the fact that our server couldn't remember simple requests like water or straws. Then after delivering our appetizer, he did not provide us with napkins or silverware. I then got up from our table to get the things we needed myself. He then got one of my daughters orders wrong and took a while to correct it and it was just corn which I'm sure was already done.  My daughters burger was way overdone and my other daughters Kraft mac and cheese was poorly made. It then took a while for our last two entrees to arrive which were just ok. We then ordered dessert to go and it took over 10 minutes for him to come back at all. In the meantime, he never brought our check.  When he did finally come back, he still didn't have our check!  The topper is that instead of immediately going to get our check after all of that time, he was two tables over taking their order!!!!!  I then had to get up to ask another server for our check to pay the bill.

Tony R.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,11,1,1.0,1/12/2013,"I've never been to a Chili's before, so I'm hoping that the others are better than this one.  This one sux! Let's start with some positives though.  Our family of four was seated immediately, so no wait at 7:45pm on a weeknight.  Also, our waitress was pretty quick to attend to our table, was friendly, and checked back frequently before we ordered and throughout our meal.  Seems like a pretty good start, right?  That's what I thought too, but by the end of the meal, I permanently crossed this place off of my list of eateries.  Where to start? ... My wife and I chose a meal pair that happened to come with a half-order of cheese fries.  Now, if you like cheese fries, and if you've ever had them at Islands, then you'll know roughly what I was expecting.  I asked for them crispy, and our waitress said that they always came out that way.  Instead, we got an order that was only 1/4 the size of Islands (barely enough for one person, let alone two), and the fries were totally soggy.  I hate fries that aren't crispy.  (In all fairness, these came with little bits of bacon sprinkled on top, and you don't get that at Islands.)  Next, a few of us asked for onion strings instead of french fries as sides for our burgers.  When the meals came out, they had fries instead.  No big deal, I figured we'll just get them replaced with onion strings.  Now look, restaurants make mistakes, and it's not a big deal.  What matters is how they handle the mistakes.  Any other restaurant where I've encountered a similar mistake, the waitress would just leave the mistaken side on your plate, and order the correct replacement.  Our waitress wanted to take back the entire order!  (Keep in mind, we're hungry and don't want to wait while our meals are re-prepared).  I object, and offer to move the fries onto a different plate so we can keep our burgers.  (For any wait-staff reading this, this would have been the waitresses second chance to just say ""oh don't worry about it, just hang on to those fries for the trouble of the mistake, and I'll go get your onion strings as well."")  So, she takes away our fries (perhaps they need to count the mistaken fries in the back?).  Geez! So, I dig into the burger.  BTW, I didn't want a dry burger, so I specifically asked them to not cook the burger to the default of medum-well, but at the time I ordered I asked for medium instead.  However, what I ended up with was the dryest hocky-puck of a burger that I've had in a long time -- perhaps ever.  Small too!  With paper-thin bacon!  And this was a $12 burger!   BTW, I asked for some ranch the server that brought our food (not our waitress) for a side of ranch.  You guessed it -- it never arrived. Well, at least I have my onion-strings to look forward to, right?  Wrong.  Once the O-strings arrived (ten minutes later, after everyone had already finished their meals), these things were the saltiest food items I've ever encountered.  Perhaps the cook was pissed that he got the order wrong and he doused them with salt, but both baskets of O-strings were literally inedible.  So, we tossed those aside.   The kids wanted one of the delicious-looking deserts, but after pouring that much $ into a disappointing meal, I drew the line and asked for the check. So, for you bottom-line / summary folks: PROs: - Fast seating; - Friendly waitress, checked on us frequently, and refilled our drinks on a regular basis even though she had several other big tables; - Bacon bits on the cheese fries; - My wife liked her chicken salad. CONs - Mistaken order, and the waitress didn't ""do the right thing"" to make it right; - Tiny portions; - Small hockey-puck burger; - When they did correct the order, it took forever, and the onion-strings were the saltiest things on the planet! - Server failed to bring dressing; Bottom line:  Poor value for the $.  One star. Epilogue: The manager held the door open for us on the way out and wished us a nice night.  What he didn't say was ""How was your meal?""  Perhaps he already knew the answer he was going to get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=260

The triple play which is chicken wings, southwestern eggrolls and chicken crispers is also one of my favorites. You can practically eat it as an entree even if that is just an appetizer.

Jyenny B.,"Gardena, CA",109,192,28,4.0,10/3/2009,"I blame it on the heat, low blood sugar and a serious hot wings craving...  I usually avoid Chili's like one avoids a skunk, but this was an emergency! I sat at the bar to get a beer quickly and then opened the menu to see the wing choices.  The first thing I saw was a picture of their Big  Mouth Burger and then was torn between a burger or wings.  What to do?  Spying their ""Triple Dipper"" deal, the solution to my dilemma was staring me in the face - order the burger bites and two servings of Wings Over Buffalo. I was in heaven when the food arrived.  Two mini burgers with bacon, grilled onions, cheese and ranch dressing and 10 hot wings with a moderately spicy buffalo sauce, served with a celery stick garnish and ample ranch dressing, all for $10.  Pair that with the cold brew I was having and this turned out to be the best decision of the day. Friday afternoon around 2pm and the place was pretty slow so the server had time to be attentive and there weren't any children to be seen or heard.  Niiice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=240
P R.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,,4.0,5/25/2013,Wayyyy better than the Carson location! I love it because they have healthy options and they allow me to make a bunch of substitutions and I don't feel like I'm hassling them! Their chicken club quesadillas are my guilty pleasure but I usually get the chicken fajitas or the guacamole burger with a black bean patty (for vegetarians it's a yummy option!) The food is as good as any chain but the four stars are for the consistency and because I have never really had a bad customer service experience. Most of their staff is good if not awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280

Roger B.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,52,,1.0,9/7/2012,"Consistently slow service & the food quality has been on a steady decline every year since they opened. Several years ago they used to be good for burgers but now they've slipped enough to where the burgers are barely better than Carl's Jr (and I've had some there that were worse). The fajitas can be good if they don't over microwave the tortillas & turn them into frisbees. When they cook them properly the baby back ribs can be good. Overall though, this place no longer does anything well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280

Steve B.,"Torrance, CA",19,256,26,3.0,11/7/2007,"I usually go to the bar to avoid the wait for a seat. waiters are great and attentive.  Food is what you would expect, nothing too great except I like the the crumbled blue cheese on the burgers. The fries are decent. The ice tea (2 options) is pretty good and they keep em' coming.

Laurie D.,"Torrance, CA",268,132,122,2.0,7/19/2011,I'm not quite sure what it is about this place. I always end up going there whith someone when they get a gift card and I shouldn't be one to complain about a free meal but dang. We got seated in the wild children and parents who are too overwhelmed with them to do anything section. It was pretty busy so we decided to just suck it up and eat. As we are sitting there deciding what to order it starts getting really stuffy and hot. I thought it may have just been us until our poor sweet server came up to take our order and her shirt was wet down the back and the bus boys was too. We ordered the 2/$20 deal that they have and we got the ribs and corn as a meal and the guac as an appetizer. The guac was excellent and after trying that deliciousness my teeth were sharpening themselves to tear into some ribs and as soon as they got there  disappointment struck. The ribs had no meat on them and the corn was really wet and tasted like tap water (I know weird). The only thing that made it really worth while was seeing how happy he was when he got his dessert. The ice cream melted really fast because it was so hot and stuffy inside but he enjoyed it. I'm not sure I would go back to this location but I would be willing to try another one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280
James R.,"Lomita, CA",12,7,,1.0,5/16/2012,"I went here today during my lunch break. We were the first ones in the section, and we waited for over 40 minutes while other patrons got their food and we didn't. We asked someone to check on our food, and they never came back. The manager was no where to be found. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant, and they've lost my business.

Elizabeth B.,"Heidelberg, Germany",18,57,1,4.0,9/2/2009,"So a couple of weeks ago my mom was visiting and she helped me with some PR event I had to do about 30 miles away, so by the time we finished some 9 hours later, we were both practically needing shots of pure sugar.  She suggested Chilis, and of course I grumbled because it's a chain and at first I pretended I didn't know where one was, and the parking here is kinda limited unless you hoof it from the usually-vacated-now ""Halloween"" store.  But since she was my guest---and more importantly, my mother, I caved and was actually pleasantly surprised!  The server was pretty funny and got my lame-ass jokes, but then like everybody else he's probably an actor and is just good at humoring corny white girls.  But I digress.  We ordered the chips and salsa and no kidding, he had it out in about 3 minutes, nice and hot hot hot.  I had the ""regular"" (sans bacon) chicken tacos and was in heaven!  I was full off the chips so I took the rest home but they were really good later as well.  Our server even gave us these football cards that were only supposed to be scratched off in front of a manager in September. So last night being the 1st, and since I have another houseguest, I suggested we hit up Chilis to see if we win anything (I am such a consumer!)  Let me just preface this:  I was in the army for 10 years and lived off MREs (ask me if you don't know what those are) for six months on my first of three deployments to Afghanistan.  Unless it's rancid, mooing, or talking, I am seriously not that picky.  My chicken tacos, oh my beloved chicken tacos, were terrible.  My friend even asked where the chicken was (there were two nickel-sized bites in each taco), but that was not the least of my worries.  Methinks somebody decided to play Merlin the Magician and replaced the sauce with some really nasty salsa...and well as many people can attest, if the salsa ain't good, the food ain't good.  I should have asked for something else, but I hate to show my ass in restaurants unless I'm getting tips (baduuum duuum!), so I just picked at them and let it go.  My friend had a margarita and I swore off the sauce a while ago, at least by the gallon, so I decided I wanted one too...which came fast, but I was missing about 1/2 inch of frozen goodness from the top.  Eh well.  Prost! At least the tacos were free since our scratch offs warranted a free dessert and entree so I didn't exactly leave (or come in, for that matter) emaciated. Eh so no chickie tacos next time...I probably will meander back eventually but it's not exactly my top 10 of yummy places to inhale a gazillion calories in South Bay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280
Janet L.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,241,63,4.0,2/10/2008,"my friend & i was trying to decide between outback steakhouse or chili's grill & bar (across the street from the del amo mall) for dinner. we decided to go for chili's. the restaurant was filled! and there was a huge crowd of hungry people waiting at the front. there were some seats which was good because we had to wait for more than half an hour until we were finally seated.  the service was great! our waiter immediately asked for our orders of beverages & showed us a selection of desserts. i ordered the firecracker tilapia with steamed vegetables and pilaf. i was a little disappointed by the size of the fish when it arrived. it was half the size of what i saw on the menu. but it was incredibly delicious! the fish was cooked just right with a crispy outside topped with a sweet yet spicy glaze that i couldn't get enough of! the vegetables were just your average healthy serving of veggies. the pilaf was delicious with the butter!  my friend ordered the margarita grilled chicken served with rice, beans & pico de gallo. when the dish came, we were suprised by the huge portion! piled high with rice and pico de gallo with three breasts of grilled chicken and surrounded by a huge pool of beans! along with that, it came with another plate of MORE rice, beans, and pico de gallo! (it didn't say that on the menu) but wow! but what happened to the tortilla strips (as it mentioned on the menu?) since my serving of tilapia was small and my friend couldn't finish the huge plate of food, i was given a huge chunk of chicken & it was delicious! grilled to perfection with all the right flavoring! as i said before, the service was great! our waiter kept making sure we had everything we needed and went to get more water for my empty cup without asking.  a great place to eat with family and friends and to get your money's worth for a delicious, fulling meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280
See B.,"Del Aire, CA",20,134,329,1.0,2/26/2010,"Subpar. Ever since I first ate at a Chili's years ago near Lakewood mall, I've always had this memory of chicken pasta, lavished in perfect Alfredo sauce and overwhelming parmesan cheese. Mmmm... Then a couple of weeks ago, somebody gives me a gift card to use for Chili's so I convinced my friends to eat at this place. I decided to replay my memory and order the chicken pasta or whatever the hell special name they have for it. My friend orders the pasta with the shrimp. We wait almost 20 minutes. It was around 2pm on a Friday. What was the hold up all about? The place only had 3 other tables filled. Anyway, when we got our order, we were not pleased at all. I must've counted like 20 penne pastas on my plate. Dry as a bone. My friend prolly had 19. Ugh. This was not how I remembered it. My fleeting memories of two cups of pasta drowning in alfredo sauce, vanished, in split seconds. I can't believe I wasted half the amount of my gift card on this dump. GAWD. While the waitress was all nice and mellow, she never really checked on us, and we kept having to flag her down to get either more soda, or more sauce or more cheese! which she gave in 1 bowl, cuz she must've assumed me and my friend wouldn't mind sharing ~_~ I may be alone in this, and this is only a single instance, and I get that Chili's isn't really known for their pasta but if you're gonna put it on the menu, then serve it like it ought to be!

Kul W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,43,1,4.0,11/5/2007,"I think it's very strange that I like this place.  Typically these places treat you almost like cattle, but I've had surprisingly good luck with this restaurants take out service.  I've been there many times for take out.   One time I had to wait due to a mix up in the kitchen they offered me a free beverage. :)  Usually I don't have to wait at all though.  I do try to avoid the busy Friday and Saturday nights though.  I do only give them 4 stars though because when ever I order a dessert with icecream, they never seem to give me the ice cream.  I don't know if this is normal or not for Chili's but at other restaurants, they get the ice cream ""fresh"" cold when I go pick up the order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280

Danny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,284,105,2.0,5/22/2008,"Ah, Chili's, my favorite restaurant in the South Bay......I know this is a chain, but it's mmmmmmm, SO GOOD! OK, I'm lying, this place was actually the source of a few nightmares for me in the past as my former boss really enjoyed getting take out here for our weekly company dinner.  Yes, every single F-ing week (sometimes we'd get Wahoo's Fish Tacos to spice things up, another place I'll never go back to).   Now, over time I had the chance to sample pretty much everything on the menu.  From the fajitas to the chicken club tacos, from the cajun pasta to my favorite thing on the menu, the Guiltless Grill Menu.   The time, and hopefully my only time EVER trying the Guiltless Grill since my former boss wholeheartedly recommended it (Yes, it's all he ordered, and I think he only ordered from the guiltless aka ""tasteless"" menu) was something forgettable.  I had the black bean burger, and seriously, never again will I order anything like this again.  Now, I don' t blame this location since again, it's a chain.  Quite frankly, I've never ate at this particular chili's since we got take out every week.  I'd say we had Chili's a good 20 times in my time working at my previous employer. Overall, the food is probably a 3, but due to my nightmare in the past, I have to lower it one star to a 2.  Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, but I won't ever go back to ANY Chili's on my own free will.  The weekly take out dinner there has traumatized me for life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=280
