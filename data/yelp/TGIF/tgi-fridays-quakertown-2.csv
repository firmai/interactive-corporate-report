Mike G.,"North Wales, PA",35,204,214,5.0,10/12/2017,"I really , really like this location. I have been frequenting for a long time, mainly in the bar area ( shocker ). It is bright and upbeat and they always play good music. The staff are always nice and really efficient. It just seems like this location has always been well managed.The food is always good . I always look forward to coming here and try to stop in as much possible. Definitely recommend this location if you like Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Brandon S.,"Needville, TX",0,17,2,1.0,9/21/2017,"So ordered food--- southern chicken sandwich --- totally burnt. Asked if i wanted anything else, said no. They did comp it and give me a free app card( which was fine) came back at night was better deal-- so I thought I might try it again the next night--- well I guess the 2 guys behind the bar were not exactly professional -- more into taking care of people they knew... asked for a drink-- got it with a attitude--- and never once asked if I wanted something to eat.... for a out of towner--- this is not the place to go. And after I paid my bill, they then inform me that if I showed them my card to the hotel I would get a discount on food--- wtf-- after the fact-- priorities screwed up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Matt P.,"Quakertown, PA",0,14,,1.0,7/4/2017,"Horrible waitress. Kristi disappeared for 20-30 minutes at a time. Was hands down the worst server I've had at any restaurant in recent memory. She should be ashamed of her lack of pride in her job. Pathetic.  Decided to give it another try and appears they can't cook a wing or a burger. The wings were overdone and tasteless, while the burger was as hard as a puck.  I took two bite and threw the meat away.  It's a shame. I usually like Friday's. But this one truly is a nightmare of a restaurant. They only thing they have is name recognition...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2

Kyle K.,"Perkasie, PA",11,23,,4.0,9/21/2016,"8:35 PM 092016. Hostess got the door for me upon entering. She seated me and then the long hard wait began. After a spell, a random manager asked had my drink order been taken? He got a server, whom he described as being a bartender, to be my guy. Beer was cold, steak needed sent back only once, bacon on jalapeño poppers was way undercooked, Mac n cheese was good and salad was cold and crisp. Two different managers wanted very badly, for me to leave happy.  Two comp cards and a comped choco brownie later, I did. I'd go back, the effort was expended, that goes as long way with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Ally S.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,5,2,1.0,11/10/2016,"Decent service, decent food, unethical practices. The guy behind my family was vaping, the waiter even came to his table while he was doing it and said nothing. On our way out, we asked the host if it was allowed in the restaurant, she proceeded to tell us their policy is that ""if you're doing it low-key, that's fine"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2

Robert J.,"Sellersville, PA",0,13,,4.0,5/2/2017,"We usually don't go here because of past experiences. Went today only because we were given a gift certificate.

Teri H.,"Riegelsville, PA",12,6,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Not kid friendly.. high chairs are miniscule, and they won't allow you to sit one at the end of your table, forcing you to sit in a table rather than a booth.  We walked out, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2

Melissa N.,"Harleysville, PA",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2016,"Visited this location last night. I am a trained corporate tgi fridays employee for over nine years. Worst meal I have had in my life. Fries were old, hard and cold. My guests chicken was undercooked. I told my waitress no shrimp in my cajun shrimp n chicken pasta. It came out with shrimp in it when my guest and myself are both allergic!!!  Our potato skins were hard as a rock. My french onion soup was over salted and tasted about two days old. Our sides of JD sauce were.not brought with my meal when I requested them when I ordered. Extremely disappointed to say I worked for this company after this visit!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Mike I.,"Allentown, PA",2,109,61,2.0,1/18/2016,Went for dinner w friends. I tried the PBJ wings because I've had them other places and really like them. TGIFridays misses the mark on these.

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,3.0,7/14/2014,"I've been to this TGI Friday's a number of times and service has varied from so-so to good. No complaints about the food though. It was exactly what I expected from the TGI Friday's chain. It's a pity that Quakertown doesn't have a whole lot of dinner choices, especially later in the evening. The diner down the road may be a better bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Candi K.,"Allentown, PA",290,709,53,3.0,1/15/2014,"One of the more generous chain happy hours - a nice selection of drink specials and nearly the entire appetizer menu is half price (most of the other local TGI Friday's) have a very limited discounted appetizer and drink list.  Had a few drinks and an appetizer at the bar to celebrate my last day at work with some colleagues.  The bar was packed but the two bartenders did a great job keeping up with the crowd.  I never waited for a drink.  My appetizer did take quite a while to come out, but the place was packed so I'm sure the kitchen was just trying to keep up.  My bill was correct and I was able to cash out quickly when I was ready.  Parking is a little tight so it might make sense to park across the lane in the mall parking lot when they are busy. It's nothing fancy, but exactly what I expect from a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2

John L.,"Quakertown, PA",0,12,,2.0,4/15/2016,Just not as good as it used to be. Always got the ribs as I did  today yea they fall apart but that's not good ribs should have some bite THEASE r over cooked. The sauce just using the same since they started with there Jack Daniels sauce. Just not the Fridays of the 1980's I go a few times a year but even the fries don't come close to their old steak fries.  They have lowered the quality of ingredients across the board to stay cost competitive.  Won't b back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
B. S.,"Clearwater, FL",45,133,1,2.0,5/23/2013,"They fill top shelf liquor with bottom shelf liquor and think you won't notice.   The manager thinks throwing free app cards will make you feel better. The food is passable but I'm still not going say it is good. I think its time TGI Fridays remodels this place and work on the management/food issues.  Not that I'll ever be coming back, I usually just come here for the drink specials or they send me some ridiculous coupon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2
Michael H.,"Hatfield, PA",0,1,,2.0,6/13/2015,"At the core the food doesn't have much taste. It all tastes like a sponge dipped in oil, fried, then served with seasoning and sauce to give it flavor.

Jay S.,"Allentown, PA",3,7,,1.0,5/1/2014,"They are so racist here and the food is never cooked properly no matter how many times you send it back. I am highly allergic to onions and I told my waitress that, so when I told her I wanted no chives on my potatoes, she said they do not do that. I have been to other T.G.I Fridays and they always cook my potatoes without chives. So why was it a problem here at this location.

Jodie R.,"Hatfield, PA",14,20,8,3.0,3/23/2013,Don't get the bleu cheese and bacon steak. Awful. Overkill on the cheese(and not good flavor) and just not a good steak. We didn't eat it and for the first time ever had entrees taken off the check. The husband and I both got it because it sounded so good and we both love bleu cheese steaks/burgers. It just wasn't good at all. The shrimp scampi we got with it was very good though as well as the tomato mozzarella salad. Our server was great. Think his name was Romi. The manager that came to our table was also great. I want to give it 4 stars but the steak was just too bad ( and they sent out the wrong steaks at first too).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20

Bret C.,"Sumneytown, PA",1,94,,2.0,11/1/2013,"Two of us had dinner here after a movie.  Because it was Halloween night it wasn't very busy, and just two (well behaved) children! We were promptly seated by a most pleasant hostess. Jefferson, our server, soon arived with the menus (three: beverages, appetizers, dinner) and told how happy he was that we were there on a Thursday night because of all of the specials that were available.  Let it be said up front that he was the highlight of our visit.  He was professional yet especially personable.  When we were unsure about what to order he patiently descibed our different options and checked back often to inquire about how we were enjoying them. The margarita ""Thursday Night Specials"" were quite good, plentiful, and a bargain.  The naco appetizer consisted of  eight nicely seasoned and baked nachos accompanied by three different sauces, enough for two to share.  The Friday's Shrimp was okay.  There were some heavily battered small shrimp mixed in with decent french fries, not the best presentation we have experienced.  The glazed salmon entree was good, topped with a nice citrus slaw with a side of steamed broccolli which was somewhat off-tasting.  The salmon piece was quite small and a little on the dry side but tasty.  The chocolate peanut butter pie was scrumptous and decadent.  For an off night, even though we were not in a hurry, we thought that the food came out a little slow.  Yet Jefferson seemed geninely interested that we have a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20
Ed M.,"Coopersburg, PA",0,20,,2.0,5/20/2013,"We came to TGIF Mid-afternoon. The place was relatively empty. The door was broken and blocked requiring going to the one on the other side of the main entry. The greeter was polite and took us to our table. Oliver would be our server she said. We did see Oliver at a distant table, but alas never at ours. He did appear in our aisle to serve people who were seated a couple of tables away aftervwe were seated. After about 10 minutes of no Oliver, I flagged a waitress to ask for a server. She said Oliver would be with us soon. She then took our order for drinks noting that this was not her table. One more try to get Oliver-- no sucess. She then said she would take our order. A couple of minutes later she came back and said she would be our server. Apparently Oliver was overwhelmed trying to take care of 2 tables and one that asked a couple of times for the check. The ribs were OK but much worse than the ribs I had here a couple of months ago. Price was much higher. My wife had a hamburger that was Ok,but the fries were cold obviously made quite some time ago. Overall, the place was becoming dated, the food overpriced. If it weren't for our new server, one star would have been too much. The main office should review training and management or just let it fail. They lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quakertown-2?start=20
