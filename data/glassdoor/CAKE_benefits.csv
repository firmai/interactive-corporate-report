1.0,"Nov 07, 2017","Current  Employee  in Atlanta, Georgia","[' It’s important for candidates and employees to know that Cheesecake Factory Benefits only offers a self-insured medical health plan to their employees, meaning they pick and choose what Benefits are covered and they pay for the claims themselves VS. a fully insured plan like Blue Cross/Aetna/United/etc. where a company purchases a plan for their employees and claims fall on the insurance company itself. Quantum Health Coordinators is the company they use to help manage the Covered Benefits and approves/denies claims. Meritain Health pays the approved claims. You DO NOT under any circumstance have Aetna insurance, yet they prefer you to use the Open Access Aetna Network providers and put it on the front of your insurance card making it confusing for employees and providers. If you don’t use that particular network, your claims will likely be denied. They do not cover applied behavior therapy for children with Autism. Most fully funded insurance plans through a work place do cover this therapy for children with Autism. It’s pretty sad. They do offer you to self teach yourself behavioral therapy for your child by watching videos and reading material through the company Rethink (after working 65 hours per week). They do cover speech, occupational, and physical therapy (20 visits each per year). You do get a better medical rate if you are Management, if you and your spouse participate in their wellness incentive program, and are tobacco free. Dental plan is through Cigna, it’s decent, kind, expensive after 2 members. Your selections will be deducted from your pay check. After 6 months of full time employment you can participate in 401k plan through Prudential. They offer a average yearly company match and other retirement products. You get 40 hours (5 days) of vacation after 1 year of full time employment. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day are closed and are floating holidays for management only to use upon approval. 18% off of AT&T Wireless service, discounted tickets and products through online perks at work program. 1 free meal per day for management and discounted meals and meal plans for other staff members.']"

5.0,"Jul 06, 2017","Current  Sauce Cook  in Lawrence, New Jersey","["" The benefits are pretty solid and are exceptional for the restaurant business. The catch is that you have to work for at least 3 months to qualify for benefits and at least 6 months to really start seeing the fruits of your labor. The Cheesecake factory has a very high turn over rate, employees basically fall into 4 groups. People that will last a week, a month, a year, and those that make a career out of it. I currently am taking advantage of their health, critical illness, and dental insurance offerings. Because I am a nonsmoker without any ongoing medical issues I'm paying about 65 dollars a month. They also offer 15k life insurance for free, the rest must be purchased, up to 80k I believe. The meal program is about 3.25 a day you work, and you get your pick from the majority of the menu baring steak or large seafood dishes. It can be ordered at any point during your shift and will be made to go if requested. You can also order any one meal at 50% off per shift, and unlimited food and drink (alcohol excluded) for 25% off. Paid time off is generated by the number of hours worked after your first 6 months. The way you generate paid time off is to get 40 hours for every 1000 hours one works. In other words meaning if an individual was working 40 hour weeks they would get a full week of paid time off every 6 months, and it is up to the individual if they want to take that time off or if they want to cash it out.""]"
