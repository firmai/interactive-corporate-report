225,Stefan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,,1.0,2012-03-16,"It was my mother's birthday, so me and my older brother decided to invite some of the family to dinner. We have had great  dining experiences at the cheesecake factory and  we. Thought it would be an appropriate venue.  We chose a central location from everyone which turned out to be the restaurant in west nyack at the palisades mall. The 1hr and 15 min wait was not so much an issue since it was indeed Friday and we were a relatively large group (12 altogether). After we finally got our seats we made our orders for drinks and appetizers, this went relatively smoothly.  Then came the entrees, everyone made their order with salmon being the majority of orders made. Within about 15 mins the waiter came back and said there was no more salmon.  The manager even came over to give an explanation for the shortage, which was understandable.  My concern is why isn't there some sort of compensatory policy in place when individuals are forced to eat something they did not desire.  Everyone told me instead of complaing we should have just left but I feel compelled to let the corporate individuals know that there is a need for some sort of appeasement to customers especially if they are giving such a considerable contribution to the business. Now I understand the manager doesn't really how we feel since they are always packed and make decent profits, but when customers are not completely satisfied they have failed as a food service provider.  We spent $458 and I know t isn't an exorbant amount f money it s still substantial and some appreciation should be shown.

Apparently it's not on the menu anymore, so this was like a first time visit for me.  We waited for 30 minutes and our buzzer went off. We go inside and then proceed to have to wait in ANOTHER line of people whose buzzers went off. Annoying.  The restaurant is inside the mall. It's too small. 80% of the tables are on top of one another and personally, I don't like being SO close to the tables around us that it's like  eating with another 4 people. On top of that, the chairs are just so damned uncomfortable. We immediately requested to be put in a booth for a. a little more privacy and b. more comfort.  So we moved to a booth nearby. I watched them clean it, however, it was still filthy and sticky and my spoon had a giant piece of pasta stuck to it. Ew! I just wanna say that the menu is WAY too big and WAY too all over the place. We ordered the Buffalo Blast appetizer which was GIGANTIC but eh. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Madeira which was wonderful and I ordered the burrito which was also way too big. I asked for a box the second she served it, already knowing I couldn't finish it, especially since I knew I wanted a piece of cheesecake.  BF ordered the Oreo Dream cheesecake. He seemed to really like it. I thought it was ok. I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and it was DIVINE. However, on the way out we passed the cheesecake case and saw there were a bunch of flavors not on the menu, so definitely check it out during one of your waiting periods, ha! Bathrooms were clean. Our waiter changed half way through because she decided to take a break, so tipping was weird. We ordered all that food and it came to $63, which is less than we thought it would be tbh.

The food is ok. I mean most chain restaurants aren't meant to provide culinary adventures (except for Morton's or Houston's) and most picky eaters can at least find something to their liking (I mean their menu is basically an entire book. If you can't find something here then I'm glad I don't know you).  Their salads are a safe bet, but most of the other meals are either deep fried or swimming in oil. I'll admit that I used to enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, but after reheating my left overs and seeing all of that extra oil, I was just grossed out. I usually go for the Cobb Salad or the Santa Fe, while the BFF goes for the Chinese Chicken Salad. If you order the Caesar salad, just know that it comes with lots of chopped anchovies (not my thing, since the flavor was overpowering and my breath reeked for about two days).

Well the waiter comes back and says the manager doesn't feel like coming down unless its really necessary. He handed me a revised bill and they removed two appetizers out of the 6 we ordered.

But if you're gonna be in the Palisades Mall and want a nice place to lunch, The Cheesecake Factory works just fine. The room has a dark wood, upholstered look, which is soothing and fits the upscaling mood that the mall is undergoing right now.  The bathroom is reasonably clean too but not spotless. Service is very friendly and efficient.  The extensive menu also includes a separate, small gluten-free menu. You have to ask for it; it's not automatically offered. Most of the items show up in various spots on the main menu. I didn't see the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad ($17.95) on the regular menu but found it easily on the gluten-free menu. It was pretty good -- the tuna slices were served sashimi style, just a bit grilled around the outer edges, which were also finished in something that was slightly crunchy/spicy.  My friend ordered from the regular menu and there was more than enough to make a filling meal: A cup of tortilla soup ($2.95) that was actually a bowl of soup, and a big chicken salad ($10.50).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=100,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.54,3.2000000000000006
176,Brian T.,"Branford, CT",3,30,3.0,2.0,2014-01-11,"I've been here for perfectly pleasant lunches once or twice in the past, and as long as you don't expect the food to be particularly creative or fresh, the Cheesecake Factory can certainly be an agreeable place to have a meal. However, let's not forget that it's called the Cheesecake *Factory*. I don't know what parts of the menu are prepared fresh in-house and what's prepared long in advance on a bleak production plant floor in a faraway land, frozen into chunks, and mailed to West Nyack for defrosting, but the ""Factory"" part of the name isn't just a quaint affectation. The kitchen does not have a production line of ten quirky local grandmas preparing the cuisine from scratch and sending it out to the tables with love and pride. The name really should be your first clue that certain rules of logic and reasonable behavior may be suspended when you walk through the door. When you have a giant chain pretending to be a bistro, occasionally the cheery façade will peel back, and the dystopian nightmare beneath will reveal itself. We came in for dinner on a Friday night, and it was a 30-minute wait for a table. That's not my problem at all, since they told us it would be that long and gave us a pager. We even got a drink at the bar while we waited. The insane parade of incompetence only began when we actually got our table and sat without any contact from the Cheesecake Mill staff for about fifteen minutes. During that time, we saw an animated argument going on at the other end of the restaurant between a woman who would eventually become our first of three waiters and a man who later turned out to be both our second waiter and the manager. Eventually, waiter #1 finished her argument, came over, and immediately began acting bizarre and standoffish, as if making eye contact us with was a problem and her top priority was to get away from us as quickly as possible. She was remarkably more chipper when she checked in on the tables near us, so we think it had something to do with our table in particular. I really don't think it could have been anything we said or did, since we were friendly, despite the delays, and since her attitude was already going in full force before either of us said a word. I am relatively certain that our party did not smell of dead cats, though that would also have explained her behavior.  Another explanation that would fit all the facts is that she assumed--accurately--that we were a couple and had a problem with that because we're both men. However, I don't think we did anything that would distinguish us from two friends having dinner and drinks, so that theory may not explain the facts as well as rank incompetence does. Regardless of the reasons for her behavior, after that first weird encounter, #1 disappeared for about fifteen more minutes before coming back with menus and water. She also took our drink order before leaving the table. Then, she apparently fell down a well somewhere in the New Jersey countryside, because we didn't see her again for quite some time. As the search parties continued their tireless efforts to find #1, #2 came over about fifteen minutes later and re-took our drink order, introducing himself as the manager, apologizing for the delay, and explaining that he'd be our waiter from now. Everything was going to be fine. We smiled. We were genuinely nice about the delay. Who cares? It's only been a half hour. The manager has taken a personal interest. They'll take great care of us from here on out. Fifteen minutes later, in a neat plot twist, a third individual came over and explained that he was actually our waiter. He took our drink order, of course! His attitude was courteous and professional. Everything was going to be fine. We never saw him again.  If you're keeping score at home, that's two menus, two glasses of water, three waiters, one manager, three drink orders, forty-five minutes, and no food.  Another fifteen minutes or so later, #1 was extracted from the well, cleaned up, and returned to us with a round of drinks. Her bizarre attitude was, if anything, worse from here on out. It was perhaps the most awkward service I have ever received in a restaurant. Things then alternated between uncomfortable and tiresome right up until we finally stepped out of the Cheesecake Ironworks over two hours after we were seated. In that time, we got one round of drinks and one course of mediocre food. Waiting twenty minutes for the check was a nice touch at the end. Cheesecake Sweatshop of the Palisades Mall, you get two stars because I've had a lunch there at least once that wasn't devised in the mind of an evil genius to torture the innocent.

172,Stefan B.,"West Nyack, NY",6,113,1.0,3.0,2014-04-07,"""Huge"" is a word that I think is very fitting for this place. For starters, it's housed in the huge Palisades Center Mall. As such, the restaurant space itself is huge. Couple that with the fact that the waitstaff may be undermanned and your service could suffer as mine did during lunchtime on a Saturday. Waiting lines can be huge.  The menu is huge, almost to the point that it's overwhelming. There are so many things on the menu that simply deciding what you want can be considered an event in itself. Portions are huge and also pack a punch with calories. The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for being amongst the worst chain restaurants for the health conscious. For this reason they created a ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which is also huge, and if you're looking through that AND their regular menu, you're going to be there a while. My disappointment in their cheesecake was huge. I didn't get anything fancy, just a standard strawberry cheesecake. It wasn't special. For a place named the Cheesecake Factory, I was definitely disappointed. But I was more disappointed for the huge price for one slice of cheesecake ($8.62!!).  Outside of their astronomical cheesecake prices, everything else seemed reasonable. The food was good for a chain restaurant, but let's not confuse this place with Jean Georges.

I was like I ate this 5000 time before and you acted like idk that your oven have a timer!!! Apology with a lied. I don't appreciate!  And time before this they burn down my dynamic shrimp appetizer too and the Waites lied said that how the dynamic shrimp look liked ( it's funny how they don't know I used to go there almost 2 twice a week ) and the sauté chicken that I couldn't finish and told them I didn't want it end up I got food poison.  I send the food back because the chicken wasn't fully cook and still have pink inside.

I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was very tasty and pretty to look at with great color. All of the flavors really worked very well together and the fresh Arugula made this pasta and battered shrimp dish taste light and fresh. Also the portion size was big which outweighed the price of this delicious dish! My mother got the Pit Beef Dip which was a hot sandwich. The char roasted beef on this sandwich was very juicy and flavorful. All of the flavors really complimented each other & the horseradish sauce just made this dish taste excellent and pulled all of the wonderful flavors together. The presentation, however, was lacking a bit. I would absolutely recommend either of these dishes to anyone looking for some delicious food. The atmosphere & style of this restaurant is great & feels sophisticated (which I like). The reason I gave the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars instead of 5 is because the staff could have been friendlier & quicker to check on us. Also, the presentation on the sandwich could have been better.

It was a hot summer night so a nice air conditioned restaurant was what we were looking for, but this place was warm and stuffy.  It also wreaked of stale food.  We were somewhat acknowledged by a server at the front desk but he kind of ran away.  A host then came by and sat us.  We were brought to a table that was wiped down just in the center. (I know this because it was still wet). There were crumbs on the rest of the table.  Dirty silverware, sticky seats, a fly buzzing around, the place was filthy.  My wife drinks wine and always enjoyed their selection.  We'll that's gone, the entire wine list was cut in half.  I ordered a beer and it came in a warm pint glass. Food was okay.  I had some sort of shrimp and chicken with curry and rice.  (Bang bang chicken?). The rice was below room temp and there was a film on the curry sauce like it was baking underneath a heat lamp.  I'm guessing they added cold rice right before it went out. Wife had salmon that was bland.  We decide on cheesecake, so we ordered the key lime to go.  We get home and the thing is a mess.  And I'm not sure it was cheesecake, I think it was just key lime pie.  The bathrooms were disgusting too.  The fact that the place was so dirty was alarming.  I'm guessing they are feeling the effects of The Yard House being upstairs and have cut labor to deal with the lost of sales.  I'll stay away from that mall all together.  BTW the servers that took care of us were great, so you can always be assured you get good service there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220,2.88,3.25,3.25,2.9520000000000004,3.102

Probably start with the easiest part first, but like most of my reviews, they become tangent and disjointed! Doing a cheesecake order to go has never been a problem. I go in, pick a few pieces out, order's done, transaction finished...off to the next part of the day. I've never had a server at that counter that was bad.  Dining in however is another story. I recall one time when we were seated all the way in the back and that wasn't too bad. The food was good, no service delays, but you do kind of get forgotten about back there. Not necessarily a bad thing since it gives you time to digest and space everything out.  The portions are huge and I can't seem to not leave that place without a bag in tow. I can't say I've ever had a bad dish there. I do remember having the meatloaf one day and recalling a voice in my head going ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach""...it was right. After that day I changed things up and got some chicken dish with pasta and pesto.

There were barely any chicken in the pasta, and if any, they were burnt and crumbly. (Everything chicken shouldn't be.)

For a year or two I have seen a decline in the food quality, the wait staff, the cleanliness, etc. But, the last time I was there, the experience was the worst of all.  Cleanliness: We were shown to our table which was set up but had crumbs all over it, food remnants under the table (pieces of broccoli, French fries, and who knows what else) and dirty silverware. We had to get the waitress to have the table cleaned, swept and all place settings replaced. In addition, While sitting during our meal we had to keep swatting away fruit flies. And the ladies bathroom was absolutely gross- toilet paper all over, wet floors in the stalls, etc.  Food Quality: I tried to order a salad (I think it was a Mediterranean salad) and was told they ran out of it. It was fairly early in the evening, so I thought that was very odd- perhaps they just don't stock the ingredients because it was not one of their larger salads.  We were served bread while waiting for our food and although the bread was fine, the butter patties were totally melted and the butter tasted like it was spoiled. The soda was served and was flat, our food orders all came out at different times and we found the food very salty- especially the French fries. In addition, for a restaurant that is known for its large portions, the salmon that was served was very small- I would say less than 1/4 of a pound for $19.  For dessert we ordered cheesecake and when it was served to us it had fallen over on the plate and part of it had probably fallen on the floor in transport. No apology by the server or offer to get us a new piece.  The Wait Staff: During our meal we had at least 5 different waitresses/waiters. The first girl who had to re-clean our table, went on break during our time there so another waitress came over to say she was covering. That was the last we saw her and then a waiter came over to address the soda being flat. Then a different waitress served us 2 of our three orders with another waiter serving the final entree. A completely different waitress took our dessert order and served it and gave us the check. Not one of these people came over during our meal to ask how everything was and at the end of the meal no one asked if we wanted coffee or dessert- we had to ask for a menu to order dessert.  All in all an expensive and unpleasant experience and one that unfortunately is not uncommon to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=100,3.56,3.27,3.27,2.372,3.386

Everything was perfect for a great burrito except the rice, it was hard and crunchy. But the sauce it was covered in was great.

The service is SLOW!! They could make so much more money (especially on drinks haha) if they just stepped it up a little and checked back more regularly on the tables.  They start you off with a basket of bread - which actually is warm and fresh and yummy. We ordered two salads and a rice dish. No one had any complaints about their food but I can only speak for my own.  I ordered the Seared Tuna Salad - The tuna was deep red and fresh BUT a little ""veiny"" - so not the best cuts of fish. The dressing was good but nothing too special. Overall it leaves you wanting more. They just throw the Tuna on a plate with salad leaves and a side of dressing. Nothing else really. I would like to maybe see some other ""greens"" within the salad.  Go here if you can't decide what you want to eat and are with a group of people.

Service could be more prompt and attentive.  Calamari was average. Eggroll sampler was really good don't remember exact pricing - about 11-13$ each. Pasta with shrimp and sausage again just average-17.50, pasta da Vinci much tastier - about 16.50. Had a coke3.50 but huge glass with unlimited refills.friend had a hot chocolate but not very hot -she sent it back and promptly got a new drink that was warm. Had to request the complementary  bread for table - it wasn't warm. Place is clean and large, bathroom the same as well.

I wish they would put the calorie counts next to all of the meal options, as opposed to just the ""skinnylicious"" menu, as I'm sure this wasn't the healthiest choice (I'm not sure choosing brown rice over white even really helped here). Friendly service. Complimentary bread that's warm and tastes good. The green tea, while a little overpriced, is delicious and free refills is always a plus. This is one of the few places where I'll order a non-water drink other than a beer. Meal servings are big enough to take home for another meal, which is nice.

Moreover, she took my order wrong, I asked her if she can take out one ingredient from my pasta, she told me she isn't sure, it will be a surprise.(how can she not know?) When I got my pasta right after we got bread, I was really surprised that she took out All the ingredients. My pasta has only veggies and noodles left. I felt it's like a joke. At this point the waitress was gone taking her break, a nice waiter helped to fix it and have it cooked again, when it came back to my table, my pasta was limp.

We asked to speak to a manager from a nice lady we saw her walk up to the manager and told him we wanted to see him.

34,Linda N.,"Albertson, NY",0,34,10.0,1.0,2016-06-23,"I really wish I could give zero stars. We went to this location last weekend and the service was hella slow. We were a party of 2 adults and 4 children. Instead of going to the food court for lunch we thought it would be better to have the kids contained in one place so we chose Cheesecake Factory.  Big mistake. Here are just a few reasons why I won't be returning to his location EVER again.  1. For one, I think they seated parties that came in AFTER us first. Not cool. When I went up to the counter to ask, they said we had not been called yet (we took the kids to the restrooms while we waited and there were more people who weren't there when we came in).  2. When they finally seated us, I asked the hostess if they had any crayons and activity paper to occupy the children as we waited. Nope, but I can give you some paper and pen, she said. What kind of family friendly establishment doesn't have at least crayons for the kids??  3. Our server, Dean, introduced himself and took our drink orders. All seemed well until he brought us a drink (seltzer) with remnants of what appeared to be chocolate syrup in bottom of the glass from its prior use.--GROSS! When he brought it to his attention, he quickly apologized and looked intent on replacing it. He disappeared for a good while until we got another. Meanwhile the first one just sat at the end of the table. He didn't bother to remove it even when he brought the new one. We had to ask him to remove it!  4. Then it took some time till he got over to us to take our orders and when he did, he seemed flustered..a box of cigarettes hanging loosely out of his smock. He was fumbling to find a pen and pad and in the midst of doing that the pack of smokes fell out of his smock. My friend's 7 year old went and picked it up for him.  5. I don't know exactly how long it took to get our food finally but it took a long time. The kids were complaining of hunger and we adults were not having a ball either. We arrived at 11:30 and didn't leave there until 1:30. We ate our food real fast when it came to us. We literally spent more time sitting and waiting than eating.  When we were looking for our server, he was nowhere to be found. We asked for more bread because the kids were starving and even that took a while. By the time the food came, they had filled up on bread. Imagine how long it took to get the check. I couldn't leave there quick enough.

After waiting 20minutes, we were seated at a table with the vent right over ours head.  The temperature outside was at freezing 32*. For whatever reason this place had a heavy draft coming out of that vent over our head. My husband requested to the same person who seated us.. male in his 20's, thin with glasses, to move us over one table that had no direct vent. He shrugged him off and said we have another party coming. He offered zero alternative seating options, nor did he give a damn. So what is there to do? Stay and be uncomfortable, or leave? Yeah, we left. I will NEVER EVER patronize this CCF. VERY, VERY poor interpersonal skills and obviously customer service. That guy needs retraining asap.

It's a solid three-star place with consistently good food, service that can sometimes be quite slow and imperfect, and almost always a wait for a table, especially on weekends. The good:  - Food is reliable and menu, as at all CF locations, is huge, so it's easy for everyone to find many things that appeal to them. - The space is huge, so it's a good place for groups. - Cheesecake to-go counter is usually quick and efficient. The bad: - We're almost always there on a Saturday midday, and there's always a wait. This past Saturday, we waited for 35 minutes for a table for 3. When our table was ready, we were led to the back to a table along a banquette -- where there were 5+ empty tables for 2, despite lots of other waiting parties. Not sure if they're understaffed or if they just didn't have any waiting parties for 2, but we were wondering if there was some reason they weren't pushing tables together to shorten the wait. - Service can be hit or miss.

80,Brian S.,"Monroe, NY",60,26,1.0,1.0,2017-02-18,"I've eaten here several times in the past years and had average consistent food with pretty good service. Last time was a different story. Me and my girlfriend walked in and luckily there wasn't a wait time, so they brought us to a section of the restaurant I didn't know existed wayyyy in the back. They intended on seating us on the last two top table snugged next to the busboy/waiter station. Also the table next to that was two parents and two kids who had seemingly given up on controlling there kids. The hostess still didn't bat an eye and wanted us to sit there..so I obviously had to say ""really, there are booths open right there not crammed against a wall?"". So the hostess said "" I have to go ask if I can move your table"". At this point I knew we were in for something interesting. After awkwardly standing next to the screaming kids and crammed table waiting for the hostess for LITERALLY 10 minutes I decided to sit down in the open booth. (Mind you all the other booths only had two people as well). The hostess finally returned after we sat ourselves and said ""you guys can sit here."". I thought that was funny that she needed to say that and couldn't apologize for taking 10 minutes to ask a question. So our waitress comes a few minutes later, she was ok, clearly stressed because she had to work the worst part of the restaurant. So after putting drink orders in we got them about 15 minutes later which was somewhat at the fault of the design and how far away from the bar we were. We then decided to order our appetizers and entrees to avoid a long wait. So as 20 minutes went by I started to wonder where our nachos were (a simple appetizer). Soon after that I see food coming but it looked like our entrees... the abrupt food runner put or food in front of us and I told him that we didn't even receive our appetizer yet. He said oh well do you want me to bring it out and I'll bring the food out after your done with the nachos. I knew that meant we will put your food under the hot lamp until your done and the we will bring out the same , now not fresh food. So I told him I'd rather you take just forget the nachos and we'll just eat our meals. (This all happened while the waitress was next to the table listening). Our meals were average as usual but tasty nonetheless. When we finally received our bill by another waitress the nachos were still on there of course so I had to wait for it to be removed from the bill.

It was a busy Saturday so this was not too surprising. The chicken dish was a little burnt, but still acceptable. One dessert ordered was the Strawberry shortcake. The strawberries tasted old and the shortcake looked like a muffin cut into four pieces that had a cookie like constancy. The bottom part was burnt black. It was as if they couldn't sell it so let's hide it in the the dessert. It was completely inedible. The waitress saw that it was almost completely left over and asked how it was. I told her it was horrible pointing to the stale tasting burnt parts. She said that she was sorry but never offered to take it off the bill or to give us another .

My first issue upon arriving at around 8PM on Sunday, was they barely had any seating( to wait for a booth). I was told by a host I could wait outside but they would not come out there to call me. No big deal I went out, and came in when a family got up.  Upon being seated, my table was clean, and neat. Though I highly disliked my silverware being on the surface of the table and out in the open, especially since there was a fly ( tell you more in a bit). Dana was my server, I let her know it was my first visit, and asked what she recommended, she thought chicken Marsala. I ordered the combination of chicken Marsala and shrimp scampi. When she returned to drop bread, she literally didn't not stop at the table, it was one motion, keep walking and place the bread on the table . When she returned with water for my toddler, it was in a glass. When she dropped my coffee, it was room temp.  To make this experience even more adventurous, when my food came, the portion wasn't even enough to fill my toddler. I literally had a boneless chicken breast with two stalks of asparagus, mushroom madness, and 3 SHRIMPS PLACED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATE( IS THIS A MEAL???). Nonetheless it was nice to try something new, and the flavors were nice, not overly salty like every other chain restaurant I've been to (sole reason for a second star, first was for cleanliness) I requested a hotter coffee for a refill, an apple juice for my son (came in a kids cup this time). My requests were honored, and I greatly appreciated it. THEN THERE WAS A FLY! (See photos) it was on my son's pizza, then my plate... & I was done, I requested my check and wanted nothing more. She was much nicer and patient, and actually stopped walking at the end, than she was at the beginning.

71,Kristen B.,"Middletown, NY",0,27,,3.0,2017-05-07,"I enjoy this chain a great deal, I find the food to be consistently excellent. We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday, and we knew it would be a little busy. We were not expecting to be told 20-25 minutes wait, but hey, it happens. After about 25 minutes, our buzzer went off and we, along with two other parties, went up to hand our buzzers in. Instead of being met by a host or hostess to be seated, we were told to stand in a line barely 20 feet from where we'd already been waiting - and we waited another 10-15 minutes there. So that's a strange seating system they've got going there, and I got the impression they were either running behind or straight up unorganized. We were annoyed, but not swayed. We were finally seated and our waitress was very good. She was attentive, and our drinks and appetizer came out VERY quickly, which was great. We went with fried Mac and cheese balls as an app, and they were DELISH and a nice sized portion for two people. We ordered our meals pretty quickly and those took longer to come out. Probably bordering on too long, but the appetizer was at least a little filling and our waitress kept our drinks full, so I didn't complain. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans - absolutely delicious, but there was a large pool of grease at the bottom of my plate which was kind of gross. I otherwise enjoyed it, very tasty! My husband ordered the chicken bellagio and he raved about it; he said the chicken was cooked perfectly and was juicy. We took our leftovers and a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake home with us. While the wait and seating system were an annoyance, the food redeemed it for us. My only true complaint is the weird vent in the ceiling over just the inside row of booths - why does that have to blow such COLD air? It isn't summer yet, and our food got cold VERY fast, and we were almost uncomfortably chilly. We aren't ones to complain about that kind of thing, but it admittedly detracts from the experience, especially when the food is the redeeming factor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=60,3.24,3.05,3.05,2.572,3.126

I have never experienced this before and I am so upset. Maybe next time the staff should actually focus on all customers instead of just seating them because they want to look ""good"".

77,Paul L.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,,1.0,2017-08-23,"Let me preface this review by saying if it was possible to give zero stars we would.  My wife and I brought our daughter to the Cheesecake factory for a birthday dinner.  The table next to us was full of older children who were not under adequate adult supervision. The children were throwing silverware and jumping all around the table pushing one another, creating an unsafe environment for our toddler daughter who was in a high chair in close proximity.  We requested numerous times for management (a rude man named Tony) to address the situation. We were told by our waiter that the manager was ""busy"".  Our daughter was then knocked into our table violently by the child at the next table who jumped off the booth into her high chair. This was the child we repeatedly requested the manager address and speak to his parents regarding his dangerous behavior.  We then began a verbal exchange with the table next to ours and we were told by management we needed to leave.  We requested medical attention for our daughter numerous times, but management insisted we leave the restaurant. Upon us summoning EMS and having paramedics evaluate our daughter, we were asked by management to leave the building and meet the paramedics outside to not cause a scene.  We agree with other poor reviews that service at this location is beyond poor.  This location is not safe for children. We strongly suggest if you value the safety of your children, to consider a different place to dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=60,3.04,2.93,2.93,,2.974

No price reduction either. When u have a toddler you try to not waste too much time in public places. Food was soso not great.. ribeye steak was thin, kinda dry on the outside but the steak was pink on inside not sure why. Boys had salad and a spaghetti which we're ok. Wife had a salad though there was more to be desired...on top of that it's expensive. All said it cost us $100 for the mentioned plates. If Prices are high the food better be top notch.

37,Shirley W.,"Pine Brook, NJ",15,8,6.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"Went there last night at 9:30. Hostess seated us at 9:40p. We were a party of 4. Our server Alfredo took our drink orders then came over with another server (Lisa) and told us we were going to be taken care of by her since he was to go on break. Lisa visited our table twice more. Once to check and again to take our orders. After this we did not see Lisa again at all and were abandoned. We are not demanding people and our orders were pretty basic. An avocado salad w shrimp, a bacon cheeseburger (medium) w fries, a steak taco platter (onions & chipotle sauce on the side as onions trigger migraines on me in large quantities and chipotle sauce on the side as I wanted to test the heat level on the sauce before eating it), the last order was fish tacos (with chipotle sauce on the side). Well... this is where the entire experience went downhill. We waited about 30 minutes. A staff member came with food in a bag and said ""here's the shrimp scampi!"" All in our table w puzzled looks on our faces said to her ""we haven't even gotten our food yet!"" She stated ""well I'll just leave this here"" and left the bag at our table and walked off. We were all left puzzled. About 5 minutes after this, the same girl brought 2 of the platters for our party. The bacon cheeseburger & the avocado salad. We waited for about 15 minutes then Alfredo resurfaced asking if everything was ok. We pointed at the table and stated 2 of us didn't even get our food! He shook his head and apologized and went off to find out what happened. At this point the manager visited our table for the first time apologizing & stated he would take the 2 taco platters off our bill. Shortly after this the fish taco platter made it to our table. Chipotle sauce was not on the side as ordered but the member of our party ate it nevertheless as she was now too hungry. Still no steak taco platter. At 10:55p the steak taco platter finally arrived. Not seeing onions or chipotle sauce on the side, I took a bite of one of the tacos. My mouth was immediately on fire and it was evident that not only chipotle sauce was in the tacos, onions were also present. Alfredo came by again. Asked him to please take the steak tacos back as at this point they were inedible. We waited another 20 minutes. At this point I was no longer hungry. Alfredo surfaced again w the steak tacos & at this point I told him my entire party had finished eating long ago, and I no longer wanted to eat (especially because in my mind this food was now made in bad faith). The manager visited our table one last time & did make good by comping the entire bill for this catastrophically bad experience. He simply stated ""i have no excuses for how bad this went tonight. All I can say is I hope you will give us another chance to make it right on another occasion."" We looked for Alfredo and tipped him nevertheless as we recognized it wasn't all his fault. This visit was an embarrassment for the Cheesecake Factory.
