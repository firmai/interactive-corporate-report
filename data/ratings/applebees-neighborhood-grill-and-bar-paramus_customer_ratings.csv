Aside from her, the wait staff is usually garbage. They'll take your order, bring you your food, and then disappear. You literally need to hunt them down. This has happened with multiple servers.

29,Michael L.,"Waldwick, NJ",48,359,141.0,2.0,2012-08-09,"Egad, how can you mess up beer?!? My number one gripe here is that something is wrong with their taps.  I've had skunky beer,  water down beer, warm beer, flat beer, and yes, frozen beer.  (Frozen flakes floating on top of the beer.)  I order Stella, Sam Adams Boston Lager, Sam Adams Seasonal Beers, Blue Moon, Bud, etc, and I get messed up more than I got it right.  Fix the problem already! Everything else is Applebee's food.  If you expect anything else, then you're off your rocker. The service is okay, no one going the extra mile, and the occasional wrong order showing up at the table.  It's a good place to get hired if you're looking for a job to hold you over this economy.  The place already developed a reputation for mistakes, so new hires are just as competent as the veterans.  It's designed to be a teen and college hangout.  You can see with the decor of the local high school memorabilia.  If you're looking for a bar grill for adult flare, go to Glen Rock Inn at Glen Rock, or the Village Grille at Waldwick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=20,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

It's pointless. If you want wine, you have to order it by the glass, and then you're lucky if it's fresh. Yucch. Don't even get me started on the lack of service.

Considering that it's Applebee's and the majority of the food on the menu arrives in the kitchen pre-packaged, pre-cooked, pre-seasoned, etc., you have to be a really bad cook to screw things up. Yet they do.  Tonight, I ordered my favorite thing on the Applebee's menu - the chicken wonton tacos appetizer - and there were large chunks of burnt grizzle in the chicken, the cilantro and cabbage topping which should be on and in the tacos, was haphazardly tossed around the food. It's also supposed to come with fresh limes, but they gave me lemons. Major difference when it comes to Mexican, or pseudo-Mexican food. It was the kind of food experience where you question the cleanliness and safety of the food that you're eating which is never a good thing... I've eaten here a few other times before this and the food is always sub-par compared to other Applebee's. Tonight was most likely my last time coming here.

36,Maxine M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,10,,1.0,2013-07-22,"I wouldn't normally bother writing a review of a chain restaurant--you pretty much know what you're gonna get when you walk in--but I had an especially interesting experience here.  I came here with my boyfriend when we were visiting his family in New Jersey.  We saw the Onion headline (""New Ad Urges Hipsters To Go To Applebee's Ironically"") about Applebee's and started reminiscing about going to Applebee's in our high school days, when we visited much less ironically.  So we get here and get seated quickly.  Waitress seems nice, if a little slow.  I start browsing the ridiculous drink menu and order some cocktail that has a name like a city in the Spongebob universe. Nuclear Baja Azul Ginsplosiontini or something absurd. My boyfriend orders a beer.   This is when things get weird. The waitress takes our IDs, studies them for a good minute or so.  Not really sure why we had to help her find the dates of birth, that's the most prominent thing on the ID.  I'm from California and my boyfriend is from Washington state, neither of which are podunk states.  I imagine she's at least seen a California ID before.   So she goes off to get our drinks.  A few minutes later she returns and asks to see them again.  This is a little odd, I don't like giving anyone my ID and letting them run off with it, but whatever.  Also I'm 26 and my boyfriend is 29, so we're not exactly the spitting image of youth. Then five minutes later the manager, who looks younger than either of us, comes over and tells us he can't take them.  ""Why?"" I ask, as I'm sure you would have. He goes on to explain that some element of my ID was slightly wrong or off and my boyfriend's ID had some tiny discrepancy between how his book said it should look. ""They're real IDs,"" I say, as I'm sure you would have at this point.  ""Did you put them under the blacklight?"" ""Yes,"" he says, which was likely a lie.  ""Okay,"" I say, and then we argued for a minute about it.  We were only 15 miles from the most cosmopolitan city in the world, it seemed unusual that a Paraman would be incapable of recognizing an ID from CALIFORNIA, the largest state in our country population-wise.  At this point I didn't even want nor care about my Thermonuclear Gin-tanamo Torturetini™ anymore.  It was all about preserving pride. Anyway, he went on to insinuate that we were attempting to scam them, and said they'd call the police and have them confiscate our IDs.  As funny as it would have been to see the mental midget of a manager get his comeuppance, we didn't have the patience for that, so we bounced.  As an added pleasantry, the manager shouted ""good luck using your fake ID elsewhere!"" as we walked out. I'd be so curious to actually talk to the manager here and hear what the hell they were smoking.  While an apology might be nice, I'd settle for an explanation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

When I was a mall rat I would walk here with all my other mall rat friends to make it for the half off appitizers at 10pm. I think it is safe to say I may as well been on the payroll I was there so much. Mind you this was when I was about 11-16 years old, after we stuffed our faces we'd wait for our parents to come pick us up and drive all of us home.  It was my friends suggestion to come here and I was very happy he made us come here. We were a little annoyed with how our waiter had an attitude but watever we didnt let his negativity rouin our experience. We started off by ordering our drinks and looking over the menu for our appitizers. We chose to order the spinach artichoke dip which is one of my favorites mmm along with the potatoe twisters that come with a cheese dipping sauce. We also ordered the build your own samplers with the pretzels and beer cheese dip, bonless buffalo wings and the tower things that sucked womp womp.  All of our food came out promptly for the appitizers at least. We ordered our meals I got the 9oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and a side salad it was very good. Two of my other friends got the 4 cheese mac and cheese with chicken fingers atop it.

It's not too bad but I don't understand why they don't have Angry Orchard on tap like other Applebee's locations. It's close to my job and convenient for the late night hunger craving.  Pros:  - Food is okay when you're hungry, it's late, and you have nowhere else to go. - Location and Parking. Cons:  - They seem to give less fries than they use to give before. Another Visit:  Went there today 5/2/15 and ordered a Triple Bacon Burger w/ Sweet Potatoe Fries to go. I get to work and opened the bag to see they put my fries in this little bag (similar to what Starbucks uses for pastries). There must have been like 13 fries in the bag. I guess if I was a Hobbit or a triple bypass surgery patient this would be enough but 13 fries really? Yes, I counted them as I ate them.

We got a $4.50 Long Island Iced tea, a house Merlot, and a Mountain Dew. Well the Long Island was absolutely disgusting, hardly a drop of alcohol, the Merlot was a given to us as a Chardonnay. That's just the beginning. When we asked the waitress for a Merlot, as we originally ordered, she got a nasty look on her face. We then ordered dinner, the 2 for $20. One being a small sirloin steak (Med Rare) which clearly says its $2 extra on the menu with loaded mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Well the small amount of cheese and bacon was also $2 extra and not mentioned bye the waitress or menu. The steak was completely raw. I sent it back while the waitress scooped the steak off my plate with the sides still on it leaving it for me while I waited a good 10 minutes to the manager bringing me a new plate with fresh sides on it. He asked me if I would like to cut into it while he was there, and I did, and it was even more rare then the first one. I mean who can't cook a medium rare steak, I do it every week and I'm not a chef or cook? I said I'm done I'll just take a burger to take home medium cooked. Well, when I went to eat it later it was also raw. I'd never order anything but an appetizer or sandwich at this location.

My cheese burger tasted weird so I only had a few bites. And the bun was burnt black on the inside. The fries that came with it were really the best thing on the table and they weren't even all that. My bf's plate came out cold, and he ordered a pint of beer but was served a bottle. I asked for extra sauce with one of our dishes, that never came. And my utensils that came wrapped in a napkin were missing a knife. To top it off the restaurant was freezing cold, and for me that's rare considering I'm always too warm.

18,G D.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-02,"Unfortunately 0 stars is not an option, or else that is certainly the rating I would choose. I'm extremely disgusted and disappointed with the service that I experienced tonight during my Applebee's visit. As a frequent customer the past 4 years and having spent an obscene amount of money here during that time period, it is a shame that one of the managers (the tall fat one with the long slicked back greasy hair and glasses) felt the need to be one of the rudest human beings I've ever met. After eating normal dinner elsewhere, my friends and I came here because our friend wanted to get her favorite dessert for her birthday. We nicely asked our waiter to sing to her and when they didn't we asked the manager why. He said and I quote: ""Maybe if you guys actually ordered some food instead of sitting here and taking up space (note that there was nobody waiting to be seated at this time) then we could do that for you"". 1. Two of my friends ordered a dessert which they were paying for and 2. If singing was such a problem he could have put it in a gentler, nicer manner considering he is speaking to customers. Last time I checked that isn't the correct way to do so. Telling us that we're basically a waste of space is just a bit insulting, don't ya think???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
