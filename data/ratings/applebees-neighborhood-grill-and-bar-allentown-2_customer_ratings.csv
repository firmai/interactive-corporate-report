19,Zachary P.,"Northampton, PA",20,3,,3.0,2012-10-24,"Our waiter Scott D was phenomenal.  They sat us by the curb side to go...the door kept opening and was chilly out.  He moved us no problem.  The door had another use though, a server hangout.  They were on their phones and just chatting.  Not Scott.  Employees on their phones is VERY unprofessional  in front of guests in the dining room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
20,Dee M.,"Allentown, PA",3,60,37.0,1.0,2012-10-28,"Food and service was mediocre. Asked for  my steak medium and I got it well done. My cup had a crack in it so I had strawberry lemonade dripping everywhere.  From the moment I sat down I felt rushed. Granted we were seated right away, which is great for a busy Saturday night. The food tasted alright- nothing special. I could have seasoned the steak better myself. The waitress was ok- not memorable which is why I can't remember her name. As soon as my son took his last bite of food she was right there with the check, almost as if she was waiting for him to do so. It just seemed like from the moment we sat down, she was getting us to leave. Oddly enough she assumed we didn't want dessert, but when she came to pick up the check she asked us if we wanted dessert. The check has been paid and we are out the door!!! Why the hell are you asking us now??? I'm NEVER going to this Applebee's again. I'm sticking to the one in Quakertown for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2?start=20,,,,,
16,Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",161,766,1235.0,3.0,2012-11-03,"We got a seat for 2 on a Saturday night with no problems despite the restaurant being packed. Our waitress took our orders right away and the food came within 20 minutes. The food was decent, which was more than what I was expecting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
17,Mathew P.,"Wevertown, NY",0,16,,5.0,2013-02-25,"I have eaten at the Applebee's chain in 5 states and this has to be my personal favorite! It is not by accident this particular resturant is always packed. The food is made well and the service is EXCELLENT!! Renata, our most recent waitress was excellent! She anticipated what we need before we even asked. If your in the Lehigh Valley, I would recommend this particular Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
18,Nichole B.,"Lansdale, PA",0,8,,5.0,2013-12-02,Love it. We always go to applebees. Doesnt matter where its at we have never had a problem and if anything would arise they would fix it immediately. Great people too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
15,Ed N.,"Lock Haven, PA",0,3,4.0,3.0,2015-03-16,Food took awhile and got my salad I ordered with my meal before my app but the staff was very friendly and helpful. ....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
12,Talia L.,"Allentown, PA",6,11,4.0,4.0,2015-03-24,"Amazing service, the cleanest Applebee's I have ever been to and hands down best service. From the attention at the door to the server who took care of us. Came in for a quick bite got treated like royalty, service really will make your visit. 4 stars because chain restaurant food is usually basic for my taste but yummy regardless! Awesome experience will return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
14,S T.,"Allentown, PA",0,19,13.0,5.0,2015-07-23,"If you haven't been to this Applebee's lately, you've got to go. We are locals. We stopped going May of 2014, because of the poor food quality and sophomoric shenanigans of the wait staff. We were growing tired of driving by Applebees to their competitors.  In a leap of faith in May 2015, we decided to give them 1 more try. Mostly due to their avid support of local charities. Bartender, Alba & Manager, Kristen won us over.  Quite a feat, we usually prefer non chain local restaurants. Since May of 2014, Applebees house was cleaned, staff was retrained & problematic menu items were changed. For example, incredibly salty tortilla chips that came with several appetizers were salted to the customers taste. Being in the business for over 40 years, our standards remain attainably high. Alba and Kristen were such a pleasant surprises! Although a recent addition to Applebees team, Bartender Alba was totally familiar with all of Applebees menu items.  We appreciated her yummy appetizer sauce suggestions.  We represent part of the population that cilantro tastes soapy to. Both Alba and Kristen are both consummate professionals. We promise we will make time to come back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
5,Josh H.,"Whitehall, PA",515,108,647.0,4.0,2015-10-05,I've been here dozens of times over the years. A majority of my visits were after 9:00 pm when they offer their appetizers for half price. I would say I tried just about everything on the menu and never had a problem with anything. The food is always good. My new favorite dish is the 4-cheese Mac & Cheese w/ Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. If you haven't had the chance to try it yet I highly recommend you do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
13,Paula A.,"Whitehall, PA",2,25,8.0,5.0,2016-01-11,This one is WAY better than the one on airport road. I've never had a problem at this area. The service is on point and the food is good. The hostesses are always friendly and I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be seated. Also this place is very clean. The prices are very reasonable. PLEASE PLEASE do NOT go to the one on airport road!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
10,Missy J.,"Macungie, PA",14,85,14.0,4.0,2016-08-10,"This Applebees needs to go over to Trexlertown and train the staff. The difference is like night and day, from the host staff congregating, chatting about their plans for after work, to the inattentive server who leaves an obnoxious pile of dishes on our table, to the sloppily dressed manager who chats with the tabe beside us for 15 minutes, oblivious to the fact that her server is sucking, to the awful food quality.  If you need to eat at Applebees, come to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
7,Rhonda B.,"Whitehall, PA",0,10,2.0,1.0,2016-12-30,"So I called this Applebee's three hours before arrival to ask if they would take reservations for a party of 7.  The person I spoke with took my name, arrival time, and phone number.  She even asked me if we needed anything special, like kids menus, or high chairs. We arrive on time, there is quite a wait in the lobby, I go to the hostess stand and tell them I made a reservation. They looked at me like I had two heads and said: ""we don't take reservations"".  Listen I didn't make this up, I truly called.  So they took our name and we had to wait like everyone else.  Ok so they don't take reservations, I get that, what I don't get is why the person I spoke with on the phone just simply didn't tell me that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
11,Shannon R.,"Allentown, PA",0,3,,3.0,2017-01-06,Food is good.  Service was quick but too many items missing from order.  Customer service was average offering gift card but didnt make up for missing food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
9,Jake J.,"Allentown, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-15,Very bad. No question about it.. fries were reheated from the previous day.. disgusting.  Chips for the spinach dip were stale as could be. Very disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
6,Jonathan W.,"Wildwood Crest, NJ",1,10,,3.0,2017-02-21,"Typical chain. Service was good. Environment was clean and commercial. We got 10 appetizers and one person got a drink for like $45. Plenty of food for 5 people and it's a fun way to eat, trying a bit of this and a bit of that. Cheeseburger egg rolls were the best, but I don't know if I'd like to finish a plate of those to myself, kind of heavy. Wings were eh. Shrimp was good. Both quesadillas were ok to good, but they have onions which surprised a disliker. I'd go again, but it's not like I can't wait to get back there. Nothing knocked my socks off. It's very likely that everything came out of a bag whole and was simply heated up for our not so healthy consumption.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
1,Sophie H.,"Norristown, PA",0,29,6.0,1.0,2017-07-02,"When going out to eat Applebee's is generally a favorite. They have a seasonal menu and I can always find something delicious. However, I was incredibly appalled by this location. Upon arrival it took our server 5 minutes to greet us after being seated. We had ample time to decide what we wanted and after she greeted us we ordered everything. As soon as she started to walk away another server stopped her to clear tables which she did for another 5 minutes before even putting our order in. She brought us our water promptly but we watched our other drinks sit at the bar for at least 5 minutes. After receiving our drinks the server never stopped back to ask how they were, and mine was disgusting. I was not expecting it to be as sickly sweet as it was. Once our food arrived mine was perfect but my friend didn't get the side of sour cream they asked for. Our server walked by twice before we hit the call server button at which point she walked by a third time without saying anything. Finally a manager showed up to take care of us at which point I got a different drink. The server didn't show back up until after we had started to pay our bill on the device on the table. I've worked in food service a long time and tend to be understanding but this was beyond anything I've ever experienced.  To top everything off, as we were walking out there was group of employees standing in the front goofing off and as we walked up one opened the door and almost hit an elderly lady that was walking in. I won't EVER be returning to this establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
8,Kathleen M.,"Allentown, PA",62,54,,3.0,2017-07-15,We used to love Applebees. Dinner was eh.  French onion soup was a joke.  It was basically a cup of soup and what they charged was ridiculous 5.49 I believe. For dinner I had the spicy Thai salad. Had it before loved it. Dressing was gross. $50 for 2 for dinner with no alcool is crazy for the meal we had. Won't be back anytime soon. Service was excellent,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
4,Amanda A.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",2,10,16.0,5.0,2017-08-04,"So lets just start off by saying that i go to a ton of different locations and order the same thing ""All day brunch BURGER "" well I've had so many and not one server gave me the choice of sweet potato fries ..i never knew it was an option until my waiter Scott asked me that simple question !! He gave me the best service that I've ever had in any Applebees !! He came right over as soon as we sat down and took our drink order he was so patient as we gave him a kind of complicated order and he brought out our food fast and everything was perfect ! Its definitely rare to get good service and Scott delivered just that ! So if anyone goes to this location ask for Scott because he's a hidden gem there !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
3,Chantel M.,"Allentown, PA",88,46,19.0,3.0,2017-10-17,"I like Applebee's a lot.  Food is always pretty good when I come to this location.  This is the issue I have with this location each time I come to this location service gets slower and slower.  I went a few months ago and it took me 20 mins to eat an about 2 hours to get my food I am not exaggerating I am very serious.  10 mins to get a server another hour to get food.  I understand it gets crowded and service moves slower, but restaurants are supposed to be prepared  for busy days.  Now I recently went last week for $1 margaritas which by the way are the worse, my waiter was nice enough to tell me that so I got a real margarita.  I waited for at least 5 mins for a server another 10 mins for drinks, another 10 for him to come get my order, 40 mins for food and it took forever for the server to come back and ask if we needed anything. Another 30 minutes for a check and again it only took about 20 mins to eat.  The service needs a major upgrade",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
0,Joseph P.,"South Whitehall Township, PA",0,7,,5.0,2017-12-21,"Happy hour today and all was great, bartender very nice and apps. were half price and delicious too.  My top shelf long island had me happy. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
2,L L.,"Mountville, PA",0,12,,2.0,2017-12-24,Brought my family here for Christmas Eve lunch and it was totally disappointing. Coffeehouse was stale and bitter. The silverware was dumped in the middle of the table for us to divide up.  Our food was like warm and the Chicken Caprese was awful. The chicken was rubbery and there was only one pathetic slice of tomato. There weren't very many customers and now I know why.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-allentown-2,,,,,
