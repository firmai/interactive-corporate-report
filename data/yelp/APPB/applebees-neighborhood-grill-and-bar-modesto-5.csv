Got a table quick, Ozzy took my order, got my drink to me fast and kept it full, food came out fast, right after my side salad.  Was full enough to pass on dessert, the Presto made it easy to pay and no sweat. Will definitely be back when I'm in town.  Highly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20
Helen M.,"Modesto, CA",22,5,1,2.0,7/23/2017,Ordered the steak southwest salad and the steak was tough and chewy. The worst was the salad greens that were wet with some type of dressing mixed in with shredded yellow cheese and thin tortilla strips. I got old lettuce that was turned dark on the edges and the whole salad part was one mushy pile. I brought it to the attention of my waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders. I'm pretty sure I won't ever be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20

Paige J.,"Modesto, CA",5,12,4,1.0,1/11/2016,"My husband and I aren't really picky when it comes to restaurants or service, we're pretty relaxed but this place was a dump. When we were seated, our booth (and the surrounding tables and booths) had large food droppings and dirty napkins under them. I had to clean off somebody else's grilled chicken from the bottom of my shoe when we left. Our waiter left half way through our meal, which isn't really a big deal. But he didn't tell us he was leaving. Then when we got our food, our plates were barely half full. The other staff were a bit unprofessional as well. One waiter was telling customers he needed extra cash as he gave them their bill. The other waiters were talking to each other about the football game from across the restaurant. We had to stop our conversations while they were talking because the whole thing was so distracting. The whole visit was a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20
Ana R.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Upon arrival, the first thing you notice is that the place smells dirty. I was unimpressed with the my meal. The mashed potatoes were obviously microwaved and my chicken was over fried. It was almost black. The spinach dip appetizer was also obviously microwaved as well.

April W.,"Modesto, CA",0,15,7,1.0,9/3/2016,"Wow! We used to come here a lot back in my 20's ( about 10 years ago) so when I stopped in with my kids today I was expecting roughly the same experience. I ordered the Brew Pub Philly sandwich. The meat tasted like it had been microwaved and was almost all gristle. The little cup of blue cheese dressing that goes on the burger was literally congealed into the cup. There was no ketchup on the tables for the fries. No sugar packets for tea. My kids ordered the Mac n cheese, and it came out dry and looked like it had been cooked several hours before. I was disgusted. Applebee's needs to up their game, because this place has gone seriously downhill. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20

Oscar P.,"Madison, WI",0,25,5,5.0,7/19/2015,When I first saw the stars on this place I honestly did not want to come but my friend said it was good so I figured why not. We got there and in less than a minute we got seated at a booth which is exactly what we wanted. After that it took less than 30 seconds for a waiter to come to us and give us the menu plus take our drink orders which was pretty great. I also spilled my drink on accident and guess what!!!!!! He popped out of no where ready to clean it up and he even suggested the type of burger I should get and it was amazing.  The food was pretty good I've had better burgers but I am a burger person tho so I have a high standard and this burger was good enough for me to Like plus the fries were pretty good also.  I do have to say that I have been to places where the food is bigger and you get more fries but all in all I could say that I would probably be back and to give this place 5 stars is a big deal to me because I don't do that often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20

Jamie T.,"Modesto, CA",143,103,255,2.0,10/19/2014,What can I say... I don't often have a good experience at Applebee's but continue to go there on occasion out of convenience like today we have family down so it was a big party.  I got the strawberry and avocado salad which I asked for the dressing to come on the side and it didn't but I'm not much of a complainer so just took a few bites and left not satisfied.  The service was slow we asked for napkins and it took over 10 minutes to get them. Our drinks were refilled slowly.  Our server was nice though. That's about it. I'm sure I'll be back someday even though my experience is never 100%.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=20
Matthew B.,"Modesto, CA",2,35,2,1.0,7/15/2016,"Well, the place was pretty busy. The waitress was polite-ish. The food is why I'm here. I only ate my appetizer, and seriously felt nauseous. We got the mozzarella sticks; I mean they were good, but too greasy. After, my table ordered their four cheese macaroni with chicken on top. Looked good, sounded good - it tasted like a spoon full of &$%*& sugar. I didn't even want to know what else could come out of the kitchen, I don't think I could've stomached it. So I pushed my plate off to the side, paid and walked out. First time I've been to Applebee's in a VERY long time, and it will definitely be the last (no hard feelings!).

Lily S.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2017,"We were out around the area and decided to order my daughter a kids chicken tender meal w/ fries & a strawberry shake. I placed the order online for take out. I ordered at 8:15 & the site said it would be ready by 8:30. We got there at 8:24, my husband went inside to pick up our order & did not come back to the car until 8:50. He was in there waiting for 20 mins more than the time stated the food would be ready by. As soon as he got in the car, I opened the container of food to feed my daughter & everything was not even hot or warm. I'm just saying but if it they kept us waiting for 20 mins longer than our expected time of pick up, the food should've been hot like it was freshly made. It was almost as if they had just forgot about our order and gave it to us when it was already cold. & the food was not even worth the wait honestly.

Chamar M.,"Tracy, CA",11,39,16,1.0,1/7/2017,"So, I call Applebee's at about 630pm to place a to go order. They place me on hold for 17 minutes. The only reason I got off hold is because I drove to the restaurant while I was on hold! I get there and have to wait an additional 10 minutes just to place my to go order.  I'm ordering dinner for myself and a few CO workers and we're all paying separately. Something we've done numerous times at this location. I inform the curbside to go order taker Cameron that I'm placing multiple orders that are going to be paid separately. He says ok, I give him the orders and 40 minutes later the manager comes out with some song and dance about not being able to accept the CCs in using for payment because the other people aren't here! I've now been here an hour. I work in a 911 Dispatch call center and don't have time for BS like this! They've taken rejected payments this way every other time but now they can't.

Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3794,2017,5538,3.0,3/7/2014,"Little known secret: I used to work at the Collinsville, IL Applebee's back in college. If you're ever driving through I-40 between IL and MO, you'll see it from the road. Sexy, huh? One would think that after seeing the same dishes over and over again (not to mention coming home smelling like it), that I would never want to eat at an Applebee's ever again. Not true, I do enjoy a visit to the neighborhood bar & grill every now and then. I especially like their mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Don't ask me why, I just do. While on a recent rural road trip, the +1 and I were deciding which chain restaurant should be our pit stop. Can you believe that he's never tried Applebee's?!? Everyone has to try it at least once... Just as I predicted, the joint was jumping on a Friday night! It really is a hotspot in small towns, and rightfully so since the food is relatively inexpensive and drinks pretty good. Seriously, I bet their perfect margarita would win in a blind tasting. The menu hasn't changed too much since the early 2000's. Which kinda makes it comforting, probably one of the main reasons why chains like Applebee's have stuck around all these years. People like to know what they're going to get, whether it's in Southern Illinois or Northern California. Our total bill for a steak, shrimp, salad and drinks was less than $40. Pretty sure nothing on our plates was locally sourced or craft anything, but it was salty and filling.

The nachos were another story stale chips strike one, strike two and strike three ( same as above) but at least this time the toppings were warm on the 3rd time out. We sat down at 9 pm.

Me, rib basket, ribs have obviously been sitting around and were thrown on the grill to warm (or in my case get burned in places) Sauce has reduced so much that it's overly salty.

Applebee's is Applebee's. It's not my favorite restaurant chain, but I have never had a horrible experience either.  It is typically a 2-3 star option. Anyway, I gave four stars because of the manager, Chris.  I was exhausted from traveling, and once I returned to the Bay area I realized I forgot my debit card at the restaurant.  I spoke with Chris, and I received my card quickly with no issues.  He went out of his way to make this possible, and I appreciate it.  An average restaurant coupled with honesty and integrity= happy customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=100

Chris T.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/27/2016,"Well. There's no option for zero stars, unfortunate when grading the Applebee's on Sisk rd. This was not our family's first trip to this location. We eat at this restaurant on average twice a month. I don't have much positive to say. Our visits and dining experiences here have been in constant decline. First, cleanliness, rather the lack thereof is profound. I would expect even a casual dining restaurant to have at least the basics of sanitation standards down. Not here by any means. The bathroom is dirty. Walls, floors, sink and countertops. Clearly there is little to no attention paid in at least the men's restroom. I cannot speak for the women's restroom. The sticky table tops, the dirty appetizer plates, the dirty flatware. It's truly bad. The 'water' ordered with a meal tastes more like a Clorox cocktail, every time. I'm sure they do not provide filtered water and if by some shred of a chance it is filtered, the company that services their beverage stations or Applebee's themselves should be embarrassed at the glasses of 'water' they serve their guests. When I send back the chlorinated water and dirty app plates I'm met constantly with a general malaise that is reflective of the overall service in general, never an apology or any real acknowledgement of the issues. I would like to pause to acknowledge the one quality server at the location, a very charming young lady, taller with short hair that has always handled business. Back to the grim reality. I haven't visited this location without witnessing a manager apologizing for some aspect of a patrons meal, sometimes multiple patrons on the same visit, anything from incorrect orders to and I quote an alcoholic beverage 'tasting of ammona.' The FLIES. Flies come from maggots, maggots are attracted to filth. The amount of flies in this restaurant is an atrocity. It's easy to understand why this place is full of flies due to the grime and filth. I can't imagine what the kitchen and back of house must look like. I didn't mention anything to staff at our last visit, which will in fact be our LAST visit. I didn't want the manager to come comp some part of my check, that's not what this is about. I want to like Applebee's, my kids enjoy Applebee's, but I also don't want food poisoning, disentary, or some other microbial infection for my family or myself. I hope somehow this review can begin a process of change for this store. That will not be possible until the very basic tenets of a properly run dining establishment are met. I rescind the 1 star I was forced to give Applebee's on Sisk rd. I give zero stars, I find it truly unbelievable how this establishment is allowed to continue in this fashion. I'm suprised nobody has been made severely ill from the conditions yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=80

They certainly down graded a bit or A LOT. 2 for 20. Got some buffalo wings. Don't you guys remember when they used to provide celery and carrot sticks and a side of ranch with your buffalo wings? Yeah, not any more. Like I said DOWN GRADING. Service is always mediocre or below. They changed managers or something, the atmosphere and energy is below the norm. The whole restaurant was probably 1/3 full and we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes for a table!? Right when we were about to walk out they seated us. And they didn't even give us utensils when our foods came out. I used to enjoy this place...its kind of sad.

Gerald E.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/2/2015,"My wife ordered food online, to be picked up at the restaurant So I can't comment on that part. This is what happened from right after I walked in to pick up the order. When I got there, the hostess ignored me for a while, then had me wait, and then helped a couple who had just walked in. After she finished with the couple, I approached her and tried to make it more clear that I was still waiting for service. I told her that I needed to pick up the food that my wife had ordered. The hostess then told me that somebody would bring the food. I told her that it was ordered but not paid for, and she said not to worry. The person bringing the food would be bringing my receipt (receipt for unpaid for food?). Along came a young man holding my food, who apologized for taking so long. I told him not to worry, which was met with complaining from his end on how busy he is. ""This is just crazy, I've got so many orders going out."" He then handed me my food, which was quite a bit, filling both my hands with bag handles. Now that my hands are incapable of doing anything short of dropping the bags, the young man shows my a printout of how much I owe him and proceeds to wait. After a couple seconds, he realized that I couldn't pay him with my hands full. He said, ""Oh, I shouldn't have handed you all that"" and then offers to take a (1) bag. With one hand, I pulled out my wallet and slid my card out. I handed him the card in his free hand, and he gave me back the bag. Now my wallet is out because I didn't get a chance to put it away before he ran off. I waited for him to slide the card at his terminal and come back. After about five minutes of waiting on the act of sliding a card through a terminal, I decided that I would take the food out to my car and come back. This made me uncomfortable, as I didn't want to leave the premises without having paid for the food. After I came back from my car, the man came back to me, telling me that he ""had to redo everything"".  What is ""redoing""? I don't know. Why I couldn't have been informed that swiping a card was too hard for them, and they had to do it twice to get it right once? I don't know. After all of that, I signed for the charges and left (to the sound of the guy still complaining about how busy he is) I drove the 3 minutes it takes to get home, and ate stale, soggy fries. The cheeseburger was ok, at best. For dessert, I had ordered strawberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was curdled. At least I am guessing it was curdled. It looked curdled and tasted sour.

The same girl served me both times and both times she provided poor service. What happened at the last visit made me decide to not go back to this location. I waited in my vehicle for twenty minutes with no sign of anyone. I finally had to remove my sleeping infant from the car and go inside to get my order. When I went in I explained that I had been outside waiting. The girl said nothing. She offered no apology and showed no concern.

Sessalie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,36,29,1.0,12/21/2015,"If I could rate this place zero stars I would. I went here on a Saturday night and the quoted wait time was 15 minutes, but we were sat sooner which was awesome. However, our server didn't come take our drink order more than 5 minutes after we were sat. We weren't actually acknowledged until almost 10 minutes actually. We place our order and let him know which condiments we wanted as our dipping sauces for our mozzarella sticks and our onion rings. I ordered the oriental salad and my boyfriend ordered their American Standard burger with onion rings. We also ordered Mozzarella sticks as our app. When they brought out the mozzarella sticks we let the food runner know that we ordered them with ranch and asked if he could get us some. He said of course, but then we never saw him again. We had to hit the call server button on the tablet that they have on the tables. Finally our server came and we asked him for ranch and he later brought it out. He brought our food and I asked him for the dressings for the salad, but waited a little under 10 minutes for him to come back with them. He brought out my BF's burger that was overcooked, when he ordered it with some pink. The burger tasted like a MCD cheeseburger and was poorly thrown together. We had to call our server on the tablet twice more for napkins that were never given to us and our check. I wasn't offered a refill until after we paid our bill. I will not be coming back to this Applebees. Worst service ever!!! The salad was good, but the horrible service isn't worth it. The manager went to all the tables around us, but skipped our table. I've been to this place with my mom because she lives right by it and they've always given bad service.

We ordered take out, and the guy who brought our food out was super friendly. We got home, opened up our food, and the steak that we had ordered well done was almost purple with how rare it was. It was missing several other key components as well, and we called up the restaurant. The manager and bartender took really good care of us when we came back in, and an entirely new order was up in less than ten minutes, a free dessert thrown in as well with everything else we wanted. Fantastic service for Applebee's standard.

My friend and I walked in to the bar around 12 am for a late night dinner and drinks we were seated by the host/busser named Robert,  after us being there for a few minutes Robert came by to ask if he could get us started with some drinks, I actually wanted an alcoholic beverage but I didn't order that from him since he wasn't our server. We were ready to order by the time he came back with our waters, so he took our order. I guess our server ""joyce"" had told him he could just take care of us. Really? He's a host/busser she never came by to our table once, avoided walking by us, so I actually was happy she wasn't our server. I overheard her say she's tired of that place. Maybe she should find another job! Best believe we didn't tip her, we left Robert a generous tip for taking the initiative to take care of us.

It's a good deal because you pick an appetizer along with 2 entrees. I think the deal is only good if you're gonna share it with someone else. We got the spinach dip as our appetizer while I got a 7oz sirloin with mash potatoes and vegetables along with the riblet basket. After being there for a while, we were still waiting for our appetizer. We didn't get our appetizer after the people next to us got their food and they came there hella later than us.

I also saw an Applebee's employee take the folders. I then got on the phone and called one of the girls who ended up coming back to Applebee's and paying both tabs AGAIN.

When it arrived it was so small and turned out to was the same size as my wifes 7oz steak. Again I asked the waitress for an explanation.

Halley P.,"Gridley, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2017,"A couple days ago, I had a good day. I went to my classes, I passed an exam, and I did some online shopping for Christmas presents. A couple friends wanted to hang out so, I mean, of course I obliged! We went to the mall, walked around for a bit, did a little more shopping, and worked up quite the hunger. (Note: This is when mistakes were made) We decided on Applebee's because of the location, affordable prices, and the Monday burger deal ($7.99 burgers and fries).  I am quite the bacon connoisseur (not really...I just love bacon) so I got the triple bacon cheeseburger. It. Was. Delicious.  The cheese was gooey, the patty was juicy and NOT pink, the bacon was crispy. It was overall quite good. I said goodbye to my friends, headed home, went to bed, and woke up for class the next morning.  An hour into my class, I felt some gastrointestinal distress. I am lactose intolerant so I am no stranger to this, but it was different this time. I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I sat there for nearly triple the amount of time a bathroom break should take. I finished up, went back to class, started to die inside, then eventually left the class to (unbeknownst to me at the time) SIT IN THE BATHROOM, DYING, FOR 90 MINUTES.  After the intense diarrhea and nausea, and after the toilet seat imprint felt like a permanent body modification, I tried to drive home. I ended up pulling over multiple times to regurgitate my dinner from 10 hours ago. I spent my entire day in a repetitive circle of vomit and diarrhea because Applebee's does NOT STORE THEIR MEAT PROPERLY. I know I don't have E. coli because that takes a couple days to arise, and I am not a medical professional, but this restaurant did not follow food safety protocol.  Either they let their beef patties sit at room temperature for too long, only to be frozen and reheated later and served to an unknowing guest, or their staff does not wear gloves/wash their hands/who knows. I cannot go back in time and ask, nor can I change the past. But I can let the fellow food-eaters who look at these Yelp reviews know about this location and the food they serve.  If you enjoy being in gastrointestinal distress, by all means, go here and enjoy a cheeseburger. --Management will be contacted--",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5
Len Len S.,"Tolleson, AZ",6,9,35,2.0,9/18/2017,"Came to eat up after a long day at the mall with a friend!  Got a whisky bacon burger, bourbon street chicken and shrimp, plus 3 appetizers (boneless wings, wonton tacos, and mozzarella sticks.) it was the 2 for $20 so we thought why not split.  Our server was great, she was so nice! She didn't mind us being loud haha.  - So the whisky bacon burger was..... ok.... nothing special about the meat at all. The only flavor I really got was from the bacon, but the whisky sauce that it came with was REALLY overpowering, like a weird BBQ taste. I took one bite and couldn't finish the rest.  - the bourbon street chicken was something left to desire; The shrimp was so tiny but it came with garlic butter and it really was packed with flavor. The chicken  Was so juicy and tender but it was TINY! Literally the size of my palm. There's no way I would have been able to get full with just that. Lastly, the potatoes that came with it were flavorless and dry. so I would probably skip on this.  The appetizers were jut plain old appetizers to me, the only stand out thing to me was the wonton tacos! The chicken seating is questionable and was a little cold but as soon as the coleslaw hit the tastebuds it just.... made sense! Seriously so bomb. I'm kind of mad they only gave us three!  Peach tea tasted like green tea with peach syrup, so there's that for you guys.  Don't think I'll be coming again very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5

Shanon W.,"Stockton, CA",77,2,,4.0,5/22/2016,Our waitress was Katelin she was very nice and helpful. We were seated in an area that was closed and she had seen that no one was helping us and took very good care of us..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Joan T.,"Modesto, CA",18,7,8,1.0,2/5/2015,"Applebee's has very friendly employees, but this is NOT a good place to eat. The food is terrible. The tower appetizer looks good, but no flavor. The fish and chips were way too oily. The batter on the fish was bland, and my fries were cold. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp pasta, and it seriously looked like one of those frozen dinners from a bag. I've heard that Applebee's Turlock and Riverbank are a whole lot better when it comes to their food; unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the Applebee's Sisk location that I will not be returning to any of their restaurants because it would be a waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Kellee Y.,"Salida, CA",0,21,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Dirty tables, flavorless food, way too expensive for low quality food. This place has really gone downhill. Years ago it was pretty good, but now it sucks! The appetizers are discussing, salad dressings and sauces are low budget, from the bottle, and the salads and burgers are just bad! Don't waste your time at Applebee's. YUCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Amber M.,"Modesto, CA",0,19,7,1.0,7/8/2016,I haven't been to this location for about 10 months. My mother and I both ordered the Mac n cheese with pepper honey chicken. Our plates were brought out to us cold then we had to wait another 10 mins for our meal replacements. Very disappointed in this experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
An K.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/20/2016,"Terrible service. Waited an hour when we only ordered appetizers. When we received the food the order was wrong and they had told us it would be even more of a wait, maybe half an hour or more to correct our order. People that came after us got their food half an hour to forty minutes faster than us. The waitress didn't even come to tell us what was happening. The manager did nothing to correct the situation or make it better, horrible experience and never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Stan P.,"Modesto, CA",1,13,6,2.0,4/25/2015,"I got it gift card, so thought if take the family out for dinner. The wait was decent, although there was some confusion between the customers in front of us. We were seated at a huge booth for two adult, child and infant. It was a bit odd, but we managed. The wait for the waitress was less than five minutes, but the good was a bit more. Our waitress clocked out for lunch before our food arrived, two of the meals were correct, and two were not.  My ribs were delicious, the kids could care less about theirs, and my wife said her steak tasted burned. We didn't bother to return it. We cut our losses, waited another rather long time for the check (why places wait to get your money is beyond me), left the remainder of the gift card as a tip so as to avoid a return trip. Hopefully, future birthdays and Xmas gifts come in the form of a Chilis gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Johnson Y.,"Turlock, CA",165,99,24,3.0,11/13/2014,"im not a big fan of the food at apple bees but This place is only good for their happy hour that they have, which starts after 9pm and is half off on the appetizers and drinks... its good for the people who want to go get a drink and have something small to munch on at nights and dont know where to really go this would be a great place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",49,258,271,3.0,2/13/2015,"Just like any other Applebees. Just another chain restaurant that lacks flavor. Sometimes when my family wants Applebees, I pick it up from the Curbside-to-Go service. It's great! One of the best I've ever experienced! The boys working curbside are always friendly and fast!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Chelsea E.,"Ripon, CA",2,11,41,1.0,3/17/2015,"Me and my husband came here and the server was very nice and he did a good job. Unfortunately the food was terrible.  They canceled my favorite entrée that I used to order and don't even have the ingredients to make it anymore. It was chicken fried chicken which was really really thin breaded chicken cooked perfectly, With homemade Redskin mashed potatoes that had so much flavor, Side of broccoli, and the best Gravy I've ever had. I am now a vegetarian but if they had that entrée I would get it once in a while because I loved it that much.  So my favorite entrées gone but we still decided to come anyway. And I just wanted to order the Redskin mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli. The Broccoli tasted like dirt very very bad. The mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor and they were so disgusting. My husband ordered a pasta dish which was pretty much the only thing he could order because he's also a vegetarian. Pasta dish tasted like something frozen that was  microwaved. And they gave him a garlic bread which was disgusting and I don't know how they messed up garlic bread because I am obsessed with garlic. But that seriously was the worst piece of bread I've ever had my life. And it was just pasta with the sauce no meat or anything and it was like $12!! We were regretting not going to Olive Garden instead.  We would've paid less and had better food! Also something I found very annoying was right when you walk in the host tells you can sit either in the bar and get appetizers half off or sit in the regular seating you don't get the discount. So we sat in the bar area. Now the host told us that all the appetizers were half off. So we pick 2-mozzarella sticks and onion rings. But when the waiter went to take our order for the appetizers it was so confusing even he was having a really difficult time and it wasn't his fault it's just the  new menus. Currently there's like four different menus for appetizers. And for some reason there's the half off appetizers in the bar area but onion rings isn't included in that. Which the host at the front door told us all the appetizers are half off. Then there's another menu which appetizers are two for seven dollars. But onion rings wasn't on that one either? So the waiter gave us mozzarella sticks and then substituted something for onion rings and rang us up for two orders of onion rings for $.50 each. It was very confusing and a hassle especially for the waiter. Waiter had to go put the order in and then come back to the table like five times to try to write up and charge correct amount for the appetizers ect.   I felt bad for him. because again it wasn't his fault.  Then for some reason to separate the bar and the dining area they hung up clear sheets and when we walked in I thought they were under construction because it doesn't look like curtains or anything it looks like they're hanging up plastic wrap for construction!! Overall I am very disappointed with Applebee's.  Before they made all these changes and took away my favorite entrée I tried to come here as much as possible because I absolutely craved that chicken fried chicken entrée. Now that it's gone I really don't think I will ever eat at Applebee's again.  Everything there tastes like some frozen crap that's been microwaved not worth your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
Emily T.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/27/2016,"Typical Applebee's, you get what you expect from a chain restaurant. I can say the service was very surprising. Our waitress was very attentive and even able to joke around with us. Even though there were no garlic fries on the menu the waitress was able to talk to the cooks and got us some pretty good garlic fries. Food was normal quality for an Applebee's and exactly what was expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-modesto-5?start=40
