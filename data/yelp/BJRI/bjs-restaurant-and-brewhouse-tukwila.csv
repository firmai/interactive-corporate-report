Cameron C.,"Carrollton, VA",42,69,,4.0,9/11/2017,"I had the Crisp Jalapeno Burger with a turkey which was very good. The waitress was very helpful and nice. The pricing was also good.

Frank S.,"Houston, TX",1,198,162,3.0,6/9/2017,"Enjoyed a quick lunch.  Had the chicken wings and a house salad.  I tried the root beer sauce and it was good. I ordered it on the side along with buffalo sauce.  My server was Christina. She was decent but not outstanding.  She didn't really know that there was chocolate inside of the caramel cookie for dessert, neither was she familiar with the type of ice cream they serve. I think that all servers should taste the food where they work and become very knowledgeable of the menu. After all, it's their profession.  I'll return because I kind of like the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
S M.,"Seattle, WA",0,260,,2.0,10/4/2017,"Its a chain so what do you expect? The beer selection is good and the food solidly mediocre, but what shocked and annoyed me is the fact that the bartender would not let me order two drinks without the other person present claiming it to be a ""State Law"" (which it may be in Utah) so I couldn't order a beer and a wine, but I could order a beer and a shot...Completely asinine, and the only establishment I have ever been to in Seattle to make such a claim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Eva D.,"Seattle, WA",52,3,1,2.0,3/15/2017,"I placed an order through ROTR and then called BJ's the day of at around 10:30 am to clarify what types of serving dishes I might need so that I could prepare for the delivery. The manager i spoke with was very friendly and helpful with the information I needed. When I hung up the phone I told my coworker that I could not wait to do a Yelp review of them becauseof his friendliness and because I love BJ's. Sadly that is not how this is review is going to go... My order was to be delivered between 11:15 - 11:30 and at exactly 11:23 am I recieved a call from ROTR that my order was going to be late because the restauarant was backed up and they were running behind. Strange, because they open at 11 and when I spoke with the manager at 10:30, he mentioned nothing about them being behind, he said they were working on my order.... So what happened???  The portions were inconsistant, salmon was WAY over cooked and the vegetables were dry and blah looking. Overall an incredibly lackluster experience which impacts me because the order was placed for a professional meeting and needed professional execution which I was unable to provide because of BJ's service perfomance.  Upon delivery we learned that BJ's has a strong reputation for running late with catering orders.  We will not be using them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Kathy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",64,157,446,5.0,8/16/2016,"I never give 5 stars, but thanks to Manuel and his great service and smile as well as the bomb azz avocado rolls, well deserved. ""Insert clapping hands emoji here"". Had to take a trip out to Seattle for few appointments and I was craving avocado. Last time I was at BJ's back home in L.A I was pretty drunk as it was my cousins suggestion due to lakers game and was well worth it and I've been craving the rolls. Price is higher in Washington state probably due to the prices of the veggies and fruit $11.95 but still the same good taste! When I'm back in this area I'll be sure to stop by again and thank you again Manuel For your great hospitality and suggestion for the mushroom caps!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Ana M.,"Kent, WA",139,99,42,5.0,10/28/2016,"I forgot our servers name, but he had dark hair and blue eyes and was very friendly. He was a bit slow with the service but I think he had the whole section to himself so it was understandable. I ordered the jambalaya. It was off the charts delicious. The shrimp and sausage and spicy taste was delicious and I would recommend that dish to anyone who likes authentic New Orleans jambalaya. My boyfriend ordered a BBQ burger with bacon and he said it was delicious. My favorite part about his dish was the thin cut fries. The decor was tasteful and the bathrooms were clean. Some people, like the lady who dropped our food off, seemed as if she didn't want to be there, but hey everybody has bad days. We will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Dustin A.,"Bothell, WA",3,26,22,2.0,3/26/2017,"To start out, the food tasted fine. Holy Jesus our service was a struggle. To the waiters credit I think he was trying but he misfired a few times. Table of 6 and we just ordered entrees and some drinks. We got 3 of the 6 entrees within decent time for how busy the place was but one of the entrees (mine) was wrong. Honest mistake because the waiter got the wrong button, I was told 15min tops for the correction. Half hour went by and nothing until the waiter brought me a salad and soup on the house. Great idea but then took an extra 15 minutes to get dressing for the salad and had to be asked twice. They struggled hard tonight but the food matches the price. I think they could have done a bit more on the bill for us though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Jamal F.,"Seattle, WA",3,3,,2.0,6/11/2017,"After visiting this location 2 previous times, and receiving mediocre food and service, I was enticed back by a gift card I was given. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya, including under-seasoned rice and cold shrimp, while my girlfriend ordered the difficult to handle, extra greasy, Swiss Portobello burger.  The service we received took about 20 minutes to ask us for drinks after we sat down, and we finished our meal and waited for the check for about 30 minutes while there wasn't a waiter in sight for us to flag down in this not-particularly-crowded restaurant. The food wasn't terrible, the service wasn't terrible, but all in all it was not an enjoyable experience and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Bri J.,"Federal Way, WA",66,142,18,3.0,10/8/2016,"Average experience at a pub style restaurant. I ordered the siraracha chicken bacon mac and cheese. It was yummy, and the siraracha was a nice kick to the mac and cheese. Portion was plentiful enough for good leftovers.  Our server was clever and kind, where she came by and dropped a hint of Pizookie to keep us thinking about it, even though we didn't order it.

Aisha A.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/20/2017,"We came to BJ's around 3:30 or 4:00. We ordered our food at 4:30. The service was absolutely slow & terrible. We waited for our food for up to an hour& some of us had to wait longer. We had kids & they were complaining about how hungry they were. WE SPENT 4 HOURS!!!! One of my family members complained & the manger was very loud & immature. She made excuses & she kept screaming ""what do you want me to do?"". She said the services was slow cause of football, but we came an hour before football. She kept making excuses. As a manger you are suppose to be professional & own up to your mistake & apology to the customer. The customer is always right. I love BJ's but this is the worst BJ's ever.

Manny A.,"Seattle, WA",56,7,1,2.0,9/16/2017,"Let me say that this restaurant isn't what it used to be. The food may be alright and the pizookies will always be amazingly delicious but the quality of service has definitely gone down hill. Last time I went I was there for the Tuesday special on their pizookies and I ended waiting almost an hour for only one. Within that time I could've gone to the store and bought some cookie dough and some ice cream, made homemade pizookies, drive back to the restaurant and still have remaining wait time for the pizookies I originally ordered. Luckily, the waiter was nice enough to apologize for the wait and out the drinks in the house but you would expect that on a weekday, service would be faster as opposed to the weekend dinner rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Anna S.,"Medford, OR",138,12,9,4.0,8/14/2016,"This an honest review with respect to the waiter. We ordered appetizers and beer samplers. We came in and our waiter was very friendly, then his mood seemed to changed and we thought we had upset him. After 10 mins or so, he came back to make sure we were fine. He did his job, we just hoped he could have been more attentive and outgoing.  Food: The Avocado Egg Rolls were very good, especially with the sweet sauce. We also ordered Flat Bread Nachos, they were ok, not the best. Better nachos can be made at home. They needed a side salsa or sauce to add more flavor and spice. The ambiance and decor was nice. A great place to dine at with friends and family. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and had a good time at BJ'S.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Josie L.,"Tacoma, WA",96,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Normally I am a huge fan of BJs. But tonight I had the worst service of my life. Came here with my sister around 9/10 pm after she got off work. First, my meal came out at the same time as our appetizer. So after finishing the appetizer, my meal was cold so I only ate half of it. No one asked how my meal was. Then, my sisters meal was soggy. We had to ask for them to refill our waters more than once. Then, our bill was messed up twice so they had to fix it. After I gave them my card, they said it was scratched so it wouldn't work. I didn't have another form of payment, so I asked the manager if he could just type in the card numbers in the computer. He said he normally could but because of the type of card I had it could be fraudulent. So my sister had to pay for my meal. Not sure what he would have done if I was on my own and that was my only form of payment?? Then we waited 45 minutes for my sisters dessert to come out, and had to ask twice if it was still coming. All that being said, I still am a fan of BJs, but will not be coming to this location ever again. I should add that our waitress was very nice and the majority of what happened had nothing to do with her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40
Jim B.,"Renton, WA",93,176,89,4.0,1/16/2017,Had a nice experience here today with my 12 year old chicken wing enthusiast.  Very friendly staff all around.  I go to a lot of restaurants and clearly BJ's has a corporate focus on customer service.  Many people stopped by our table including the General Manager to make sure everything was OK.  Pretty impressive.  I got a mini one topping pizza and side salad lunch combo that was just right for me.  The pizza was small but it was deep dish so it did the trick.  Pretty standard pizza though.  Had to go with bacon for my one topping.  My kid got the calamari and the hottest wings they make and she reported a thumbs up to me on both.  I like TV's and there's a lot of them in this place.  This is for sure a sports themed bar/restaurant so I imagine it would be fun to watch a game here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=40

Rhi S.,"Seattle, WA",410,255,672,4.0,11/11/2015,"We came around 4:30-4:45ish today (Wednesday) and were seated right away. Service was pretty on point this evening. We were greeted and our orders were taken right away. Our appetizers too less than 10 min to come out and our food less than 15. I had the bacon guac burger and my boyfriend had the bbq pulled pork sandwich. I thought my food was delicious until I tried his.. I looooved his sandwich! They checked in on us, brought us water and overall gave us good service. We each got a mini pazookie*. It's been a long time since I've had one and turns out I didn't really like it. The outside is cooked but it's completely uncooked inside. I figure it's supposed to be like that but just wasn't for my taste. Plus, at this point I had to drink water after every couple bites and my glass ended up empty and for the first time in the evening no one walking by would notice until our waiter finally came back and we asked him.

Anna T.,"Seattle, WA",207,87,78,5.0,6/2/2017,"It's rare for me to give 5 stars to large food chain restaurants because it's hard for me to ever get good service or good quality food. But when I came here for some food during the NBA finals, I had a amazing experience. I didn't have any expectations at all because it's not like this is my first time here. However, our waiter Andre made all the difference. He was kind, friendly, quick and prompt. I've never had a waiter check on me so many times in a restaurant like this. We got everything we wanted and asked for. He always made sure that we did.  There was also a different waitress that was helping a huge table next to us and see seemed very fun and enthusiastic. So I would give service a thumbs up!  Each day (or most days of the week) they have specials. We came on a Thursday and the special was half a slab of ribs, 2 sides, 1 salad, and 1 smal pizookie for only about 14 dollars!!! That's a lot of food for 14 dollars man!

Kimberley C.,"Renton, WA",1,26,74,5.0,5/7/2017,"Their food never disappoints me! Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both loved it!  I ordered the jalapeño burger and he ordered the portobello burger. We split each in half and shared with each other. Both burgers had perfect balance! The jalapeños weren't overpowering the flavor of the burger (jalapeño burger) and the pesto was so good (portobello burger)! The buns were good as well! Right amount of crunch and softness. I haven't had their burgers before so it made me happy to know that their burgers are actually good.  For dessert I ordered the Oreo birthday pizookie for my boyfriend. So delicious!

Food here never disappoints, this is the only BJ's restaurant i know of in the Seattle Area. I would recommend the Parmesan Crusted Chicken or Pulled Pork Sandwhich. They up there prices a bit so everything was from the range of $13 and up.  AMBIANCE/SERVICE: 4/5 They are usually super helpful and you can get a free pizookie here on your birthday.

Not only was the food not the least bit satisfaction my server Crane S.

We then ordered the Lemon Parmesan Chicken and Portobello Fries. All was well, as usual my hubby and I split the plate. Now I don't know if the hair I ate was from the extra plate or the food. But needless to say it was not good.  Sam our server was so nice and made it right. He was kind and professional and took great care of us.  The only reason my review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the long facial hair in my food.  We will return and try again.

I have worked in the food industry as a bartender and server for 10 years. So let's just say I know a thing or two.  Service was good. Food was good. It's just disappointing when you are spending the last night of your trip with your family coming from Los Angeles to get a Long Island Iced Tea that tasted far from it. I don't know what is going on with these people here. But my sister and her co-worker had experienced the same thing on their previous visits.  It was really a disheartening experience because even though the server offered to have the bartender remake it, my confidence was lost. I took a look over and can tell you this guy has very little experience bartending.  So much for having a nice dinner with the family. Yes not having my long island iced tea ruined my experience. Too bad because I really liked BJ's. I'm not sure I'll be back.  They need to re-train their bartender. It was a short petite size latin in his mid-20s. Perhaps a server who was recently promoted but needs solid training how to make a drink. You don't just fill the cup with ice and pour the spirits in till it fills up.

There was no host or hostess at the door to seat us, and despite the very empty restaurant, the waiter who finally came to seat us told us it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. I glanced over his shoulder though and noticed the also empty bar, so we bypassed the wait and went to the bar. The waiter at the bar was attentive though, and our food came out relatively quickly. We had a classic deep dish pizza - it had a great, soft dough, which I liked. The Santa Fe egg rolls, which we kind of picked on whim, were also quite good. Even though the initial appearance was a bit disappointing, the service once we were seated was okay, and the food, while not life changing, was on the better end for a fast food-ish chain.

I've had the quinoa and salmon (forgot the name) but it's the healthy alternative that satisfies while still getting the 'eating out' quality. There's a fancy grilled cheese that's ultra tasty and sweet alcoholic beverages galore. Also, beer on tap to pair with their satisfying pastas and burgers. Whenever a friend is from out of town this is my first pick.  Pro tip: try out the avocado egg roll or potato skin appetizer, super delish if you have the space for a 3 course experience.  2nd tip: monkey bread and chocolate chip pizooke are my favs.  This location in particular consistently has great customer service!! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=20
Krystin T.,"Seattle, WA",101,400,,3.0,12/30/2017,"My husband and I ended up meeting a friend here not long ago. We'd been trying to go somewhere else but that place was a 45-mimute wait, so we ended up ar BJ's because it's always a good standby.  I actually find the food tasty, which it seems some other reviewers don't. I've never had anything I thought was bad; this time I had the basic burger with a veggie patty + cheese. It and the accompanying fries were great. My husband had the fried chicken salad and seemed to enjoy it. Our friend ordered the hot wings and complained that they were not, in fact, hot. We also shared some cheese curds which were fine to me but as our friend pointed out, they weren't hot and melty like they are at some places. My main issue, if you can call it that, was the service. Our server was pleasant but nothing made it to us especially quickly. My husband and our friend also ordered calimari which just...never came. I had to ask twice for water and condiments. Appetizers (the cheese curds) came out after our entrees. Nothing horrendous but just not the most amazing service one could have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila

I mean I get it, sometimes people have a rough day, but it shouldn't get taken out on other customers.

Chris V.,"Seattle, WA",17,255,599,3.0,10/29/2017,"Just not impressed with this location in Redmond. Getting a table seemed like a disorganized affair to begin with but we had a lovely waitress that made up for my initial experience. It's a very nice restaurant and very comfortable for a nice dinner. They weren't in a rush to push us through even though they were busy so that was nice but the burgers were just OK. The sweet potato fries were good, as well as, the parmesan chicken too. I very much enjoyed the deep fried jalapeños on my burger but the burger wasn't anything special. If they offered the deep fried jalapeños as an appetizer, I would be all over it. We had a nice comfortable booth for a nice visit with family but I wouldn't go back just for the food. I think the Tukwila location's food is a little better. I may try it again someday but I'm in no rush to return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila
Wen W.,"Seattle, WA",317,233,335,4.0,4/19/2017,"BJ's Brewery House really stands out to me because of their book menu! Unless you know what you really want, you'll be drowned in those pages. I love the portions here, for they're huge portions for you to eat.  For work lunch today, I ordered Mahi Mahi and Shrimp from the low-calorie menu. The sauce was amazing, and my seafood was delicious! The meal was fresh, light, and perfect for lunch. The only thing I'd have to critique is the slippery way of the the sauce being smeared on the plate. However, I still enjoyed the meal very much.  When you are at BJ's , you cannot go wrong with Pizookie! Two minis were ordered: Oreo cookies and salted caramel. Hello! The Pizookie minis were so yummy! The cookies were warm, and the ice-cream melted right off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila
Kellen W.,"Cheney, WA",104,55,38,4.0,1/7/2018,"Through all my experiences here, overall the food is good but the service can be hit or miss. If you have never been to a BJ's, it is a much classier and higher quality restaurant than something like Red Robbin, but I wouldn't think of it as a high class restaurant. Being a Brewhouse, they have their own beers available - and from what I've had they are all pretty good, nothing I would complain about. They have a pretty wide range of food available on their menu, everything from burgers, sandwiches, salads, Mediterranean tacos, and chicken rice pilaf. With the range of food there is definitely something for everybody, and they do have a lighter portion of the menu. We have enjoyed visiting during their lunch hours because of their specials and lunch combos. And of course, it's pretty hard to beat their dessert. If you have never had a pizzookie before, it's something you must try. It's a large, slightly undercooked cookie of your choice, served in a pan and topped with ice cream. Probably one of my favorite desserts of all time. We have had some problems in the past with their service. I don't think it has to do with how busy they are, because we have had servers even at lunch where it can be hard just to find them and get water filled among other things. However that hasn't stopped us from going back, and it's something that easy to pick because of their wide menu selection. The biggest downside to their restaurant is that it's at the South Center mall, so parking can be a real pain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila

We had to wait an extra 20 minutes and finally got a table.  Our server was okay although there were times when our server disappeared and was no where to be found. Although the good thing was that this place made sure we got our water filled a lot.  Food was honestly okay here. I got the Peruvian Salmon Quinoa and the salmon tasted dry. We ordered the Calamari, but when we tried to eat it we noticed it wasn't fully cooked. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken and that was pretty good though! The chicken was actually moist!

Camille V.,"Tacoma, WA",91,249,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"Update - 10/28/18 - I spoke to the general manager, Jennifer, who was extremely apologetic and explained what's been going on at the restaurant. She compensated us for our troubles, so we will go back sometime and hopefully have a better experience. Jennifer clearly knows what she is doing and is striving to get her team on board. While I won't change this one star review, I hope the next one will be more than one star!  ------------------------------------ Last Saturday, I walked in with my husband and two children, ages 15 months and 5 years. We were meeting my cousins from out of town, with their two kids, one of which was in a wheelchair. Eight people total. I didn't know that the restaurant could take reservations ahead of time, which is fine. The young woman said we would need to just wait 15 to 20 minutes for a table. Great! Thirty minutes later, we are still waiting. There is an empty room, towards the back, with barely anyone in there. Finally we get called, and as we sit down, we find out that they called the wrong name and we have to get up and go back to the lobby. My son was near tears, he was so hungry and frustrated. I did my best to be nice and not too annoyed. Forty-five minutes in, we are told that the table they are waiting on is just finishing dessert and paying their check. Any minute now. We inquire if there are any other tables, we are told no. Just that one. My 15 month old is starting to lose it and they bring her a plate of food - a roll and some fruit. One hour later, we are still. waiting. I get up and tell the hostess that myself, my husband and our two kids are leaving as we have been waiting over an hour for a table, and still nothing. She is very apologetic, but I'm beyond caring as my kids are starving and tired, and we have put up with this situation for longer than we should have.  My cousins decided to stay and wait for a table of four. I understand it was a Saturday, a busy time, but the fact that they didn't offer us any sort of compensation, that there was only ONE table for our group, I found that really hard to believe. Especially as we left, that back room was still close to empty. We will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila

Natalie M.,"Maple Valley, WA",9,36,28,4.0,7/4/2017,"Here is why I am a fan: -Awesome vegetarian and lighter options. You can get any burger with a delicious veggie patty, which is not a Boca brand patty. They have cauliflower tacos off of the lighter menu, and they are phenomenal! I only wish you had the option of getting three tacos instead of two, because man, they are good.  -BEST side salad available at any chain restaurant. It has a variety of fresh greens, croutons, and thinly sliced parmesan. Even their balsamic vinaigrette is amazing. When you get a side salad at Red Robin, it is crouton-less and has wilted iceberg lettuce. It is so much easier to eat healthier when the healthy options are this satisfying.  -Excellent non alcoholic beverages, especially their in-house root beer.  -We came here for my birthday, and I got a monkey-bread Pizooki (sp?). It was kind of like a Cinnabon a la mode. Definitely worth the splurge.  Keep up the good work, BJs! I am sad that they got rid of the super thin crispy fries, but that is my only qualm.

There were heaters to keep us warm, and it was nice because it was away from the main area at the restaurant so our party could have some privacy and be as loud as we wanted. We had the buffet style dinner since there were about 20 of us. All of the food was delicious and was just about ready for us when all of us had arrived. The Caesar salad was fresh, the deep dish pizzas were sooo good, and my favorite was the crusted chicken Parmesan that was so Delicious. The servers were great even though all of us had our own alcohol tab. You could tell they have been around a few large parties before. All in all, not a bad spot to have a larger group dinner.

Stacey P.,"Renton, WA",50,387,11,2.0,7/20/2017,"Once upon a time I really love this restaurant. I loved it so much I joined the loyalty program.  I thought that they had great drinks, delightful service, and some of the most delicious pizza.  These days though that is in the past.  The greeters have no interest in making eye contact with guests and often just tell me to go to the bar instead of offering me a table even when it's not busy. The service is very hit and miss with most of the time being pretty terrible.  The menu is constantly changing. Every time I find something that I really like it I often see it removed next time I visit. Their deep dish pizzas which were once delicious are now often with very few toppings and cook too long.   Let me give you a recent example. I brought my mother here from out of town.  As usual the greeter at the front told us to go sit in the bar. We found a small table and sat there and waited for 10 minutes before anyone talked with us.   Our waitress never made eye contact with my mother the entire time.  She would not listen to my mother and often times I would have to order on behalf of my mother so that  she can get a drink refill. She never refilled her water without asking. She never checked on our table.  We often just saw her standing by the bar talking to the bartender. When the food came out it was all right. Wasn't really the highlight of my mothers trip. My mother was very offended and shocked about how she was treated as she had never been treated this way at any restaurant before.   It is very disappointing to see how BJ's has evolved over the years. Where once it was a really great restaurant it's no longer really worth anyone's time or money when there are so many other options available to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila

If you actually want some good food, then you have the wrong place. They make their own beers and they have a few other options to choose from. I had the oasis and it was refreshing. It looks like they have a decent happy hour too, just not when I was there. Food wise, there was the standard selection of bar food ranging from tacos, to pizza, burgers, and even ribs. All the food looked kind of bland. Tasted bland too, but wasn't horrible by any means.   Atmosphere was chill. Tons of open seats in a pretty large area. Wide range of people, from families with small children, to teenagers and adults. Kind of what you can expect from a place at the mall. Service was quick and attentive. I came in and 4:45 and wanted to leave by 6:00. We already paid and were out the door by 5:45. Overall, I wanted a booth, a beer, and a decent meal near the airport. Got what I came for. Nothing more, nothing less. Prices were reasonable too. Solid 3 star place.

Elisabeth P.,"Olympia, WA",171,499,1200,4.0,1/23/2017,"I had dinner here one night and it was one of only a handful of times I've been to a BJs since I found out I have Celiac. One of the best things about BJs and gluten is that they do their cookie desserts gluten free! Such a treat!  The atmosphere of this restaurant stays true to others in this chain. Lots of the classic big booths on the sides and tables in the middle of the rooms. I enjoy the low lighting, brick, and interesting artwork they always are designed with. I was greeted and shown to a seat on a not so busy weekday afternoon. My server came over right away and wasn't sure what I could have on the menu. The manager came over and was very helpful. Their list of official gluten free items is actually rather limited. The manager was great about seeing if her kitchen could accommodate other menu items I was interested in by simply leaving out an ingredient that would then make it gf.   I went with the southwest chicken salad which had a nice kick to it and wasn't unbelievable but overall was a pretty solid salad. Then I moved on to the star of the show, their gf pizookie covered with ice cream ... sooo delicious. Probably due to their limited menu I won't be having dinner at a BJs too often, but it's definitely my dessert scene! Food came out quickly and there was plenty of food. My server was great and super friendly and price of most of the bj menu items are quite affordable.

While the selection of beer is decent, they don't offer many cider choices. The pizza is probably the best thing they have on the menu - speaking of which, has become like 'Cheesecake Factory - It has to be at least 12 pages! But sheesh... the prices are on the pricey side.  A tiny pizza, maybe 7"" round is $13  A large will set you back $30. I opted for a burger, which I requested to be cooked medium rare - but was served one that was medium well.  I think this is just what their timers are set to, because that's what was initially offered.  Only regular fries offered as a side.  I forget if it even mentions any side options.

Roanne C.,"Seattle, WA",788,144,1188,2.0,3/17/2015,"I never really enjoy going here. The service is really mediocre no matter what day, time or how many is in your party. The only time I ever go here is for group celebrations, not because of the food, but because they can accomodate for large gatherings.  In my opinion, the food here is waaay too greasy, but then again you get what you pay for. The burger buns look like somebody slathered tablespoons of oil on them; it leaves residue on your fingers when you're holding onto your burger. The fries are never as hot as the burger, or the other way around. The pastas, or pizzas for me is always a safe choice when dining. My favorites would have to be the Cajun Pasta and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. They also have their pizookies down to the tee. You can order any one of them and it would taste delish.  Unless you're craving for a pizookie, I would suggest dining elsewhere to make your time worthwhile.

Server lacked any common sense or skill. Wait times are mind numbing for food. I like the Rewards program though since you can generally get something discounted. Pzoooie menu for dessert isn't big. They have maybe 6 flavors. Appetizers are extremely overpriced for some reason. But the burgers never disappoint. I would take them over mall food any day of the week. If you have an issue though you'll have to complain a million times to get them to fix it. They comped my meal last time which was nice but all I really wanted was fresh hot fries not cold stale ones.  Worlds biggest menu. I swear by it. Dozens of brews, beers and fruity fun favorites. I reccomend the bjs brew house burger and an Alabama sunset drink. Perfect combo to round out the night. Open late on weekends til 12 ish perfect for after Movie beer or snack. Huge tvs everywhere, fancy bathrooms, all sports all the time. The homemade root beer is addicting. Bottomless refills for sodas, teas and floats.

Gentle V.,"Seattle, WA",60,190,521,2.0,2/14/2015,"Overall, BJs is an average restaurant and will do if you're in a real bind. I give it a 2.5/3 star Yelp rating.  This place reminds me of The Ram, Claim Jumper, or other chain restaurants. I've been here a couple of times, but most recently for a Thursday Happy Hour. My friend and I needed drinks before we watched a movie at AMC, and we thought BJs might be the place. **ORDER LIST DETAILS (on the HH menu): --Chicken Potstickers ($5-$6): Four small, steamed potstickers and a pile of shredded carrots as garnish. The potsticker had a good, meaty flavor profile, but the carrots seemed unnecessary on the plate. --California Chicken flatbread ($4): Two small squared pizzas that were a slight step up from a frozen appetizer purchased at a supermarket. --BJ and Strawberry Mojito (~$4):  Too sweet --Lemon Drop Martini ($5): Too bitter, with none of the sweet tartness needed to make this drink soar. There was no sense of balance between the lemon and vodka. Other considerations: PROS: - Convenient location in Southcenter Mall with easy parking options - Happy Hour is Mon - Thurs until 7 PM and it's relatively cheap ($4-$7/ item) CONS: -Food was edible, but the quality could have been better. - Bar area is not big in size, so you have to wait for a table sometimes when it's crowded. - There wasn't anything unique about my experience here, which is too bad.   - Customer service is hit or miss, but more of a miss overall. However, I'm hopeful that my experience may be different for regular dinner outside of HH.  I may give it a try if I'm not being too picky next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=120

R R.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,2.0,7/8/2017,"Went in on a Friday night around 10. It wasn't that busy and we were able to find a table in the bar area right away. It took about 5 minutes to get a server to come to us and basically throw menus on the table as he rushed away. We were ready for at least some drinks...maybe ask if we want drinks before walking away? When the server finally came back around we ordered drinks, an appetizer, and meals. They were out of the beer I wanted so I ordered something else. Drinks came out and they were cold and really good. Our meals came before the appetizer, though. They asked us if we still wanted it, we said yes, and they said they would take it off our bill...no big deal it happens. But we finished our meals and still no appetizer!! We ordered a second round of drinks and the server brought me what I originally had ordered (what he said they were out of) which was a nice gesture because I really did want to try that beer. The server kept apologizing about the appetizer and we told him we didn't want it anymore (the point of an appetizer is to enjoy it over drinks while you wait for dinner). Anyway the appetizer finally came out and we sent it back. They asked us if we wanted to take it home but we had a movie to catch. Checks came out and there was an additional 20% off for the inconvenience which is greatly appreciated. However, I had 3 beers on my check and I only ordered 2! At that time we were in a hurry to get out of there. When we finally got the server's attention he seemed bothered at the situation. Excuse me, but it's not our fault you can't review your checks before dropping them off at your table. We hadn't been to BJ's in a while and this experience didn't make me miss it.

Sandy H.,"Kent, WA",0,2,,2.0,6/26/2017,"It was Sunday and one of the hottest days of the year. My hubby and I decided to go out to eat. As we walked in, it didn't seem busy at all which was great. We sat down got our menus and it probably took us about 6 or 7 mins to decided what we wanted. We ordered two appetizers, potato skins and Ahi Poke, the Ahi Poke came out. I had the Ahi Poke before there and it was delicious but this one, I was disappointed, it did not taste like the one I had before. It was not flavorful, the dressing tasted a little sour. I ate it because I was hungry. But never again, will I order it. It took 18 mins for my hubbys appetizer to come out. How did I know this, I took a picture of my Ahi Poke and looked at the time stamped. :( A minute later our entrees came out. The point of an appetizer is to eat it before our entrees. Then give us a few mins break. He ordered the Jambalaya, it was NOT worth $18!  I ordered the shrimp and arugula pita taco about $11. It was alright, I felt like I could of made something better. I overheard another server telling a customer that because it has been slow all day they sent a few employees home. Even though it was slow, the service shouldnt have to be slow. Total was $59 I don't think I'll come here again unless a friend wants to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=120

Their wings are pretty good even though they don't have a variety like buffalo wild wings but the quality definitely tops the competition. I also love the fact that they carry my favorite hot sauce (cholula). BJ's was also one of the few places where I could count my macros when I was doing a strict diet because not only that they had nutritional facts but they had a lower calorie menu as well.  My only complaint is the service.  I would say 8 out 10 times the service is horrible.  Food takes forever to come out.  Do not go here if you're on a hurry. When they are good they are great.  I use to work in the restaurant industry.  I understand there are times that it gets busy or if you're understaffed however I go here often to know that is not the case.  Either it's poor management or training.  It would of gotten an extra star if it wasn't for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=120

I got a half California sandwich with the avocado and house salad. It was delightful and exactly what I was looking for. The cucumbers in the salad were diced which added originality and something different to a pretty bland dish. And the sandwich was large considering it was only a half,  the chicken was also strips rather than one large piece.  I believe that allowed for more of the juices to flow within the sandwich making it more moist.

Reginald N.,"Kent, WA",144,59,247,3.0,2/20/2013,"Just had lunch at BJs and thought I'd offer another perspective to the disappointed.  Having worked in the restaurant industry (Cucina! Cucina! and Bahama Breeze), I consider myself pretty understanding with delays and wait time, esp if the food is worth it.  Especially in the Southcenter area, how many times can you do Olive Garden, Red Robin or Applebees?!  I find it interesting that patrons will wait for over 30 minutes and not say anything rt away for fear of someone 'ruining' their food. Honestly I return to BJs for their PIZOOKIE'S and Snacks and Small Bites.  The Cookie's and Cream Pizookie is so good!  And the Red Velvet was tasty, too!  You can even do the Trio and select 3 different pizookies.  Their small bites are like happy hr selections available anytime.  New $2.95 BRATWURST SLIDERS were excellent!  Try the wontons or the fresh mozz and tomato salad, too. As for the subpar service, I can only speak for myself but whether I sat in the bar with a friend or dined in with my nephew and nieces, we have had nothing but pretty good service.  Especially when I brought my nephew and nieces, our server was friendly and engaged them (which I appreciate).  I would probably come more often if the Happy hour value was more competitive!!!  Just $2 off for HH apps?!  Why not half off? (pls note, BJs) I just don't find myself at the mall on the regular but if you're looking for some affordable selections (compared to Joey's or Dukes), try BJs and see for yourself.  Not everyone has a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=160

Patrick B.,"Kent, WA",45,206,130,5.0,10/1/2015,"BJ's has fast become one of my go to favorites when it comes to good American food. The restaurant is large and the entire thing is set up like a sports bar but there are two definitive areas. The family dining area and the bar. The staff has always been super friendly and very attentive at every BJ's we've gone to and the food is superb.  From the appetizers to the entrees and dessert. They may be a brewery first and foremost but they know how to hire some chefs! Some of the best calamari appetizers we've had anywhere and if you visit during happy hour, you can load up on multiple appetizers to share and get to sample everything.  They do brew their own beer and I have tried a lot of them but if you don't like anything they make, they do offer a few other brews which is a nice contrast to other brew pubs that only serve what they make.  I've ordered a lot of different items here from their pizza to ribs to steak. I love their rib eye with a loaded baked potato but sometimes, they get steaks with a very high fat content. I like a well marbled steak but near 50% fat is a little too much so I have to try other menu items on occasion to avoid that happening.  The place is friendly and inviting and there are TV's all over the place so that you can watch whatever sporting event is on at any given time and they don't charge an arm and a leg so you won't walk out feeling like you've been robbed.  I will remain a BJ's fan for as long as they keep up the good work.

Besides wanting to drag the butch out by her hair, I was ready to rearrange the entire restaurant. I was furious. Our food arrived shortly after the manager arrived. It was luke warm and cold! It sat for more than 20 minutes, as I stuck my finger down the middle of the burger.  Look, I get it. Servers assume when a young family with 2 kids comes in, they might not tip very well. It was clearly obvious, as an older couple arrived after us, and finished their meals before ours arrived. Needless to say, I am a great tipper, and I always take care of our servers when they give good service. I even gave our server a $5 tip, even though we never touched our food, and left starving. Dinner for me was Taco Bell. At least they can pump out a hot gut rot meal in less than 2 minutes out of a drive thru. My suggestion? Avoid BJ's, especially if you have kids.

The waitress finally came in and took our order after another 20 min. went by. We then waited 45 min. until our food came and it was cold. She never came and checked in on us once. The manager had to go get her to come get our dessert orders, which by then I was so over it. When the checks came, she was very rude and snobby that we all wanted separate checks(i understand splitting them is hard but a little professionalism would've been nice) and when she was giving my friend change, she kind of tossed it in front of him.

I come here mainly for the Pizookie or if I am with my friends and need to kill some time. I suggest sitting at the bar when eating here because it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  I don't really like the food here because the quality and presentation is almost the same as Red Robins or Applebee's. The bartenders, hosts, waiters and waitresses are always very friendly even when there is a lot of people. You can definitely bring smaller children here or even big parties because the restaurant is ideal for that type of age group and party sizes.

Then the appetizers came out and it was deep fried calamari so that usually doesn't take long to make, but it was so cold and soggy that it was nasty. We return back our food and ask for fresh pizzas and calamari. The manager apologize and then our food came out within 10 mins.

The avocado eggrolls sounded so good on the menu.... mmm creamcheese and avocado. WRONG. It turned out to be an overcooked, overspiced mess.

Denise A.,"Shelton, WA",0,3,4,2.0,12/17/2017,"My friend had taken me here last night for the first time and I was very excited. But for some reason , some of the staff weren't so great. There was someone  cleaning the revolving door at the entrance so it took us a minute to figure out  if the place was still open or not since there were not many people inside .  It was about 10pm when we got there so we thought "" hm weird , thought they opened till midnight "". But my friend all of the sudden saw customers inside still eating , so he figured  they were still open. We were in the middle of still deciding wether to come in or not when the staff who was cleaning the door  glared at us then gave us the "" shrug"" almost like she was upset. It was so weird . Then I saw her say something to the hostess then they both glared at us . My friend and I were so confused because at this point it was just really awkward . So when we finally went through the revolving door  and were inside the restaurant , we kindly tried to explain to her why we were looking inside from the outside because we thought they were closed. But she went on and gave us an attitude saying "" YEAH WE ARE STILL OPEN"" not even making eye contact as she proceeded to clean the door Again.  So we kinda just smiled and walked up to hostess feeling even more weird . When we got up to the hostess , it was just a very weird vibe. You know when you're in a place and people treat you crappy and make you feel u wanted  ? Yes, it felt like that . My friend and I were so confused at this point because we couldn't figure out what we did wrong for them to treat us this way right on the spot. We didn't get a "" welcome or a Hi Hello there"". But at this point we didn't really care anymore because our expectations were already low. So my friend  told her table for two please . Then She told us "" if you're over 21(which we are) , u guys can sit at the bar. Go straight and it'll be on ur left hand side "" in the most unwelcoming approach ever  . So we just didn't say anything and followed what she told us to do. When we finally sat down , my friend and I finally discussed about the whole situation. We were still very confused, there was no need for those unwelcoming Rude vibes we got  when we walked in. But thankfully our server was sooo KINDD. She was very very pleasant , gosh I wish I remembered her name. She made up for all those BS. So I thank her very much!

I'm a little butthurt that they took the side/appetizer mac and cheese off the menu =( I've tried their salmon dishes before which I liked. I also enjoy their clam chowder. Ahi tuna salad was a bit salty and overwhelming.  Last night I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese which came with a side of fries.

Tara B.,"Bellingham, WA",123,63,81,5.0,8/29/2016,"I loved this place, the only brief hiccup was while we were waiting to be seated. There were four or five staff members standing with their back to us chatting while we were waiting for a table. When we got to our table everything was smooth sailing. We were with two people who had dined here before so they were able to recommend some awesome dishes. We ordered two flights of beer, two specialty drinks, and two deep dish pizzas to share. This place is very family friendly, we have a 7 month old, and it was nice to feel like she wasn't a burden, There was even conversation surrounding her. I cannot stress enough how wonderful it is to have your child recognized and welcomed in a restaurant, kudos to our server who made us feel like we could dine there.  My flight included a beer they no longer had and another server asked me what I would like instead (after bringing the other five I ordered) I thought this was awesome,they took the responsibility upon them to make sure I had what I needed. I also got to try a beer i never would have ordered otherwise. We had so much fun dining here. I would go back in a heartbeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=60
Joaquin D.,"Federal Way, WA",4,14,9,1.0,7/4/2016,"First timer in BJ's and I'm not too happy with their first impression. It must be the soccer game going on because the service was horrible.  I've waited in a restaurant before but this is by far the worst. I could've shopped in the mall and came back and still wouldn't have my food.  And when I got the food, I wasn't impressed. The deep dish ravioli wasn't pleasant. The cheese in the ravioli was so dry I finished my water with 4 bites of the ravioli. Which I should've conserved. Because my waiter never stopped by the table to check on my group for drinks or questions. So basically the whole group was sharing water at this point.  To top off the meal. We got our checks and we paid it in three ways because we were a party of 6 that were paired up. Anyways, he repeated the meals to us so he could split it. But when we got the checks it was all sorts of messed up besides one check. We then let the waiter know, and he ""fixed"" it. Or we thought. He still billed me for my friends dessert. I didn't want anymore problems so I just paid his dessert.  Thought it was the end, but it wasn't. The one couple that has the correct receipt paid theirs. And found out they paid $40 less than they were supposed to. They thought they were blessed, until the other couple paid theirs, and found out that they paid the first couple's bill.  Basically, horrible service with alright ravioli.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=60
Conni M.,"Seattle, WA",4,86,5,4.0,5/4/2017,"The bar was full but we were told we could have Happy Hour in the restaurant. The server said we could read the board in the bar for HH offerings. Uh, ok. She then asked if she could get me some iced tea or a soda. She certainly read me wrong as I ordered a Sapphire Martini, straight up. We were rescued when the people we were meeting found us and had a different table with a different server. They had already ordered appetizers - chips and (great) salsa and amazing Siracha Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were halved and braised and crispy with a Balsamic reduction. Delicious! I had the boneless chicken with the root beer glaze and loved them. Also one of the best beet salads ever, although it was a bit overdressed. Someone ordered a full rack of ribs that came with cheesy potatoes and they said they were juicy and falling off the bone good. Another got a Mediterranean deep dish pizza and thought it was really good. Someone else ordered a steak and it was cooked perfectly. And, finally, someone ordered the sliders with fries, which were disappointing and not very good. If you usually request tartar sauce with your fries you might want to skip it here. Theirs is like a thick Thousand Island dressing. We will be back because of the beer selection... and the great berry cider.

Clara S.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,1,1.0,8/29/2016,"It takes A LOT for me to write a bad review, I usually opt to just not return to the restaurant. I've been to BJ's a good amount of times at different locations and a proud rewards customer. Six of us went for dinner at 7pm on a Monday and were seated at the outside dinning area. It was not very busy as a little less than half of the restaurant was filled. After taking our drink orders (5 drinks) the waitress came back in a few minutes to take our dinner orders. We ordered 6 entrees and 1 appetizer. When the waitress came back with our drinks we asked her if she could get someone to tell the constructions workers who decided to smoke in front of the restaurant to move. She looked at us and said ""oh."" And then she walked away with our orders. The construction guys never moved nor were they told to move by any staff member and they came back to smoke in the same area once more during our dinner. Our dinner came more than 60 minutes after we put in our order, including the appetizer! I think that defeats the point of an appetizer...I had a stuff mushroom as it was my friend that ordered it, it was lukewarm. The waitress came back to tell us twice our food was being ""plated/almost ready."" When our entrees FINALLY came out more than an hour later (this is not exaggerated, I started timing once it passed 40 or so minutes) my two friends who had fries, had cold fries. We were all too hungry to send it back. After our table decided to get pazookies hoping it wouldn't take as long...we were wrong...our pazookies took 30 minutes! We only ordered 3 of them.  I watched the other tables, there was a party of 7 and a party of 10 that all came after my table and they all had their food in what seemed like a timely manner. 4 other tables with a party of about 4 came, ate, and left all within the timeframe our table of 6 was still there...I honestly didn't get it.  I went to the front as we left to take a picture with my friends who I haven't seen in a long time and to also see if I could speak to someone about our experience this evening. There was no staff member to be found! We stood at the front for 10 minutes, looked around and gave up because honestly I got so tired of waiting.

Alex S.,"Seattle, WA",2,71,1,2.0,11/27/2016,"This is a classic modern-brass-bar-style mall restaurant, similar to the many others on which corporate restaurant stereotypes are based. You'll find no surprises here, and for that reason I award one extra star. This restaurant will likely meet your expectations. It met mine. For example, when I ordered a burger they asked how I wanted it cooked, and I replied ""medium."" This is just a formality, they don't actually cook burgers to order, so I was not surprised when my burger came out far over cooked, fully dry well-done with no hint of pink. This sucks, but it should not surprise you, as it should be obvious that BJ's doesn't have real chefs custom-grilling food in the back.

Chris S.,"Bellevue, WA",104,36,26,1.0,1/22/2017,"I said I wouldn't write a review but seeing that a fellow Southcenter service industry worker gave his perspective, I'm compelled to chime in also, to confirm that some of the steps taken and not taken by their customer service team is unacceptable.  I'm a very understanding and forgiving person especially because I've been in the industry for 10 years. I know how things work and why some delays may happen at times and how to recover from them. I always give service workers the benefit of the doubt. The host team and manager at the host desk deserved none because even when their joke of a ""reservation system"" is so flawed, no one apologized for the inadequate way they handle reservations, acknowledged us for the loooong wait we endured just to get a table or even thanked us for being so patient. We had already been waiting so long that we decided to just commit to eating here rather than finding a new spot. For what it's worth, the host team was just a handful of (seemingly inexperienced) young girls doing what they're told to do (I've been there) but they turned to a clueless manager who still was unable to address any of our concerns appropriately or effectively for help. The only redeeming quality was our server Desmond who was very attentive and genuine. He did everything right as his role as our server. EVERYONE ELSE from the host team to management to the expo and the kitchen staff failed us. I understand some things the server has no control over so we took care of him because he apologized profusely, and took steps in trying his best to correct the situation. He let us know a manager would come by to touch base with us and that never happened. I would have loved to have spoken to a manager.

He didn't send it back because let's be honest, they would have put it under a heat lamp.  It took another 20 minutes for the rest of our food so not only did my husband have to wait after he was done eating for our food to come out, but he also had to wait until we were all done eating.  The server checked on us right after we got our food and then would walk past our table several times not even to refill our drinks.  I saw the manager check on several tables, but would literally walk past ours without so much as any acknowledgement.  The server honestly didn't deserve the less than 15% tip I left.   It is important to note that it was NOT a busy evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=80

I can't speak for the service as a whole, as my first time at this location was about a week ago and we had a horrible server. The only thing that saved our visit this evening for our 4 year anniversary was our server, Sojin. If reviews were based solely on one staff member, I would be giving 5 stars. Actually, the only reason I'm writing a review is to recognize him. Being as I have been a server/bartender for over 15 years myself, I pick up almost instantly if the service is going to be good or bad. As soon as he greeted us I knew we would be taken care of. Awesome and REAL personality, proper timing, prompt on orders, refills, clearing, and checking up on us and his entire section. Now, the food is definitely a different story. Although the menu is quite large, most of the food is less than mediocre and over priced. I ordered a steak tonight, medium temperature, that came out more than well done-it was hard as a rock. Cold mashed potatoes and shriveled up asparagus. I was hesitant to allow the guy delivering the food to make me a new one as we had already waited 45 minutes and a steak is not a fast re-cook item but he walked away and made that decision anyway. It's fine, I get it, stuff happens and I understand that more than the usual guest. Where they really lost me was bringing me another well done steak 20 minutes later. By this point (I'm 9 months pregnant) I really didn't give a damn and ate it anyway. Pretty sad when a cook, whom I assume is at least somewhat experienced, can't even get a re-cook item close to correct.

Ashley N.,"Seattle, WA",43,6,,1.0,3/12/2016,Didn't even sit down. Had a dinner party tonight and what a mess. We reserved for a really big party but there was no coordination between the servers. One of the servers was extremely rude after one server told us we could use the booths when our party overflowed. Yes I know it's frustrating since our party was 10+ people but he had no customer service skills. Some of the party just left because we were so upset.

Carrie T.,"Kent, WA",1,195,4,4.0,11/30/2016,"I've been here a few times for dinner and/or happy hour.  So this is a general overview review, the servers and hostesses have all been very friendly and attentive. We are greeted as soon as we come in. The time spent getting seated, ordering, getting our food, servers checking on us and time allowed to eat, enjoy and chat with friends and then wrapping things up have all been just fine! I never felt rushed, I never had to look for someone. It is a standard ""American fare"" with burgers, fish, salads, soups pastas etc. so no surprises there. I like that they do switch the menu around so I see some usual dishes and then I see some seasonal or new ones.  The menu is a ""book"". Tonight I lost my place! There are some ""lighter"" dishes which is good and plenty of appetizers which are pretty large in portion and can be a meal too if you add soup or salad.  it's a brewhouse so lots of beers but also glad they have cocktails, wines and sangrias to choose from as I am not a big fan of beer (yeh....ok....I am not...)  I think the quality of the food is good for the price.  The price is about average in comparison to similar restaurants though I think there are little more ""healthier"" and have more vegetarian dishes to choose from  compared to like Rams or Red Robins.  I shall be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180
Jami B.,"Federal Way, WA",6,9,,2.0,2/14/2016,"So this review is both based on service and food. Let's start with the good. I was looking for a pizza place other than domino's or pizza Hut or the other standard places. We had heard the pizza here was great. Went online and placed our order. The process was quick and easy and we choose to pick up.our food at 11:15. The pizza itself was AMAZING!!! My partner is definitely a pizza aficionado and she adored it. We got the pepperoni extreme. The sauce was great! We also adored the julienned pepperonis. They were great. What made it for us though was the dough. It was soft and ligjt. Sometimes with deep dish you get hard and crusty dough. Definitely not the case here. It's going to be our go to pizza place now!! If this review was only on food, you would have a five star review.  The service was were there this place needs big time work. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a place that was open late. The website said nothing about it being only available to a certain time. Let us do everything and never gave us any notices about takeout being closed. Get to the place and the hostess takes 7 - 9 minutes to even come up front and acknowledge I'm there. Have about 5 servers go by and just give me nasty looks and not ask if I need anything. Finally the lady comes up. When I tell her I'm there for takeout she gets SUPER NASTY! First words out of here mouth are, in a nasty, nasty tone, our takeout closes at ten. Don't place orders after that. I explain that   here and I had no clue and the website didn't advise me so. She then says well don't   again, not jokingly. Then takes her another about 15 mins to.find my order and ring me up. If she would.have just went and got my order and POLITELY mentioned they closed take out at 10, would have been totally satisified. Will I be back? Maybe it will be better inside but this experience was a major turn off! Better training and management needed for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180

I ate at the bar. I'm dieting  so i ordered the superfood salad with cajun shrimp minus the blue berries , jicama, and sweet corn in addition I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Bartender didn't write down a thing. When the salad came out there qwas no shrimp on the salad. I told the Bartender she said it would be righr out. I had to ask for the salt an pepper. When the lettuce wraps arrived I reminded the bartender that I still did not have the shrimp. She said it was coming an I would not be charged. I finished the salad and the lettuce wraps still no shrimp. The bartender asked if she could remove my dishes and I reminded her I never received my shrimp. She asked if I still wanted them. I said no.  I did not leave a tip. My bill was $25.19. What would you have done besides not going to BJ's?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180
B B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,138,23,3.0,4/15/2016,"I've been to BJs in Portland a few times and to this location twice. Same beer. This location is very nicely decorated, music isn't real loud, so that's nice. I don't want my experience to sound like a concert hall. The beer selection is pretty fair. Didn't count the taps though. They had 11 core beers and probably about a dozen guest taps. I found a few I liked. I glanced at the food menu, but didn't order anything since I wasn't hungry. The food prices are definitely those of a nice restaurant. In other words, don't come here expecting to spend under $10 on a plate. There might be some, but the majority of things I looked at were at least that much. Most items were more. Usually I have wraps, sandwiches, or mushroom swiss burgers. They did not have anything I wanted. While they had burgers, it was clear their focus is pizza. I found the beer to be somewhat expensive. A few for $5.95, most were $6.25, which I think is high considering beer is *cheap* to make. The only beers I will spend that much on are German or Belgians from their origin. All of these were standard beers. Place was clean, ages were all over the place. I would say mostly 30s and 40s. Most people were dressed business casual, but it was only about 7 at night, not late, so I wasn't expecting the late night party crowd. Two ladies were bartenders. I didn't catch their names. A young blonde girl with a pony tail and a black girl. The blonde rushed me a little, seemed more interested in getting me a beer than samples, although she did so without incident. If I'm spending over $6 on a beer, you bet I want to know what I'm drinking. I'm not just going to pick something to have a drink. I don't work that way. The black girl was alright, a little more serious, not so much playful. She offered another drink, but I was done at that point. I would go back if I was with someone and we wanted a nice place to go, but I probably wouldn't go back by myself. The beer is a little pricey for me considering nothing was spectacular. Not sure if I would have dinner there since nothing on the menu jumped out at me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=180

Normally the pizza is really good. I ordered a mini California Supreme and it was still a bit doughy on the inside. Our server was nice, but not very attentive. I ordered a club soda with muddled limes and it came back with lemon. I got the attention of what looked like a manager walking by and she got me a new drink. After our food arrived we pretty much never saw our server again. It would have been nice to get a refill on my drink.

Once we put in our order it took about 45 minutes to get our food and my pasta came out with the wrong type of pasta. Our waitress came by and mentioned that the manager will come by and see us since we mentioned to her that our order took forever. 10 minutes pass and the manager (Michael) finally comes by.

Their scampi pasta was like plain pasta tossed in w some veggies, sprinkled some green things and topped it off w a couple shrimp and bread sticks... all of that, yet I still feel like I ate just plain pasta. Other time I came here, I had a pizza. It was the BJ's fave or something... it was first on the menu and I was disappointed. It was such a soft pizza like I'm eating straight up dough. The crust was the most disappointing part, because there was no crust. hahah.  It was rly just super plain and sad.  If I were you, I'd just order a bunch of appetizers.

We were a party of 5, and our table was a bit too small for us. They tried to move us, but all the larger tables were taken. We were flexible and said it was okay. They offered us a free dessert for our flexibility - that was totally cool because we didn't ask for anything and were totally willing to stay where we were. But, that's a great example of excellent customer service.  I ordered the French Dip with skinny fries and my son ordered shrimp tacos; also with skinny fries. In addition, my cousin ordered potato skins. My French Dip was amazing with caramelized onions and a horseradish spread on the side - the bread was super fresh and all the flavors melded together in a mouthgasming explosion. My son loved his tacos, and said they were enough to fill him up; which is an amazing thing as he's a 12 year old bottomless pit.

We were greeted immediately and got our drink orders in. It was happy hour so almost everyone got something off of the happy hour drink list. I got the BJ's mojito. It tasted really good...if I was looking for a minty lemonade. They could definitely spiked it up a bit more with the booze. I also ordered the lettuce chicken wrap. It was not so good. The chicken did not taste like chicken. They felt like something out of a tin can and just glazed over with soy sauce. It is in NO comparison to CPK's lettuce wrap :( Finally, I shared a Pizooki sampler with my co-worker. We got the original chocolate chip, cookies n cream, and white chocolate macadamia nuts. I really enjoyed the white choco mac nuts one! It had a perfect balance between the sweetness of the cookie and the creaminess of the ice cream.

Fast forward to 25 minutes later and they are calling a name, which sounds like mine but is not. I go up and speak with the hostess who has written my name down incorrectly and presumably was seating other people before our party because of this. Slightly annoyed but willing to just get a beer and call it a wash, we sit down. We order drinks and wait...a long time. Having been a server I could tell she had too many tables and was sympathetic to this.  Then, I am proceeded to be given the most watered down beer I have ever had in my life.

The first time I was meeting a friend.  I ordered one of their own beers.  It was disappointing.  I feel like if you're advertising yourself as a brewhouse, you should brew decent beer.  I got a fried buffalo chicken wonton plate for $3 or so and it was delicious.  My friend showed up and we got some avocado egg rolls.  They were ok, but nothing impressive.  The pizzas we both ordered were mediocre, but not worth what I paid for them at all.  The server was clearly rushed and brought my dining companion the wrong drink.  We sat there for a bit (it was a weekday afternoon and they weren't very busy) and the server abandoned us shortly after we finished our food, dropping off the bill and letting us know she was leaving.   I came back again the other day with another friend.  This time I was smart and did not order BJ's brand beer.  We got an appetizer plate that had a sampling of items.  We replaced the spring rolls with extra mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were lukewarm and the dipping marinara sauce was overly sweet.  There was also avocado egg rolls again which were ok.  The other item on the plate was spinach dip, which my friend mostly ate, but the chips for dipping were super salty.  The server working the bar that day was better, which was nice, but it still wasn't that great of service. Overall, for how expensive this place is, I'm not a fan.  I feel like if I'm paying $20 for an appetizer platter it should be impressive.  If I'm paying a lot for a pizza, it shouldn't taste like I cooked it out of the freezer myself.  I've definitely experienced better probably won't be stopping in anytime soon again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=200

I definitely don't think that this place was as bad as people say it is. The food was actually pretty decent - I think that the service was the weak link of the meal.  Our food came quickly enough but our server was just super apathetic. Maybe he was having a bad day.  My friend recommended the soup and sandwich combo - so I had the chicken noodle soup and the grilled chicken club. I was surprised at how many noodles there were in the soup. Usually, a cup of soup only has some broth and a couple of noodles here or there but this one was packed. That being said, it was kind of salty.  The grilled chicken club was also really good. It was greasy and garlicky which was awesome and terrible at the same time. Just the right amount of food for me.  This place is probably one of the better options in Southcenter. I haven't been to many places but it definitely looked nicer than some of the places that I walked past.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=200

After out table was called we moved to our table and the new server was very nice. What was even better she was fully updated on what drinks we had already ordered and asked if I wanted another. Also she knew what appetizers we ordered (from the bar that hadn't come yet) and said that they would be coming shortly.   My food was great I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich (I'm on the hunt for the perfect on that I don't have to make) and I must say it was great the pork was tender and the bread was really soft and delightful. I did order a side of extra BBQ sauce just incase it didn't have enough and the sandwich was a little short on BBQ but not by much the extra side of BBQ sauce did the trick. All and all we ordered 5 drinks, an appetizer, 2 main dishes and a dessert and tipped, our bill came to about 95$ and I am totally okay with that given the service and amount of food.

We weren't incredibly hungry so we opted for sharing. Our cousin and I decided to share a ""make your own"" flat pizza. It was basically a large pita. We asked for it with mozzarella, black olives, and pepperoni. I also asked for sauce because apparently in Washington that's not a given (something we realized after eating at several places during our visit!) The pizza was good enough. It was a bit under cooked so I did miss the crisp it could have had. There was also a bit more grease than I would have liked. We actually ended up ordering a second one since we expected it to be filling enough for the two of us but it wasn't. The second one was crispier but tasted like it used different cheeses and the toppings were more sparse. My husband got the spring rolls and brussel sprouts with siracha sauce as his dinner. He seemed to enjoy both as the sprouts were gone in a matter of  minutes and he polished off his spring rolls later in the night before boarding the plane!

We just visited this last weekend with some friends and the only positive thing I can say about our visit was the host station. They were very friendly and seated us within 15 minutes. That was where the service stopped! We were seated at a broken table, we didn't even see our waiter for at least 20 minutes. There were other tables around that we could have been moved to but were basically told too bad. Our drinks didn't come for another 20 minutes and it wasn't even our complete order, the last of our drinks came well after our meals. We had to ask 5 times to get water, which also came after our meals. Our appetizers came after salads and before drinks. The appetizers were cold so clearly had been ready for a while. Of course during all this time waiting, we never saw our waiter. He didn't deliver anything to our table nor did he check up on us. Our entrees also arrived cold. About 2 minutes after we received our entrees, our waiter arrives finally only to give us our check. We had only just begun to eat them, clearly not finished with them. This is our the second bad experience in as many trips to BJ's. We will take our business across the way to Moctezuma's from now on where the food is always good, hot and the service is spot on.  I tried reaching out to the management of BJ's the next day, it's been 5 days and I have yet to get a response. After my recent experience, I am not surprised! BJ's you just lost regular customers.

We tried their new item the fried chicken strips the meat was really juicy and my type of fried chicken. Meaning it wasn't so fried that u felt my arteries constrict with fat. The corn was a nice complement to it. But wasn't too impressed with their mash potatoes. The pasta was good too, got the grilled chicken cream pasta. Wasn't too impressed with it but it's price and taste and portion is very reasonable. Lastly their flat bread. We always try to try a different flat bread we come and at different restaurants, we are a huge fan of flat bread however this time we weren't too impressed with their blue cheese steak flatbread, their flat bread is good but the California flat bread they offer is better than the steak one in my opinion.

Since it was a Tuesday night, the place was not that busy. When we walked in, nobody was there to seat us and their phone was ringing. We waited nearly 10 minutes. And still nobody came to the front to seat us. We had to walk up to an employee and asked to be seated. Really? (Remember it's a Tuesday night and there was only 8 tables occupied from what I remembered). Not only did we have to asked be seated, the waiter then brings us around a corner and seated us literally next to a really rowdy group. I looked around and the whole row behind me was empty. I really didn't understand why she couldn't seat us a few tables back where my boyfriend and I can actually have a conversation. The group was so loud, and disturbing (making racist comments and being immature). It made me uncomfortable and was hoping our waitress will come along soon so we can asked to be moved to a more private seat.  But she took a very long time and I lost my appetite by then, and asked for the check after our drinks. She had asked what was wrong and I told her that the rowdy group's conversation was really disturbing and made both of us uncomfortable. She apologized but then said my bad experience could've been avoidable if I would have asked to be seated somewhere else. I almost looked stupefied.

First of all the decor is nice and has a good modern feel to the whole establishment with the proper lighting. Second the food is really nice and tasty, My gf and I decided to share two appetizers for our meal since we weren't too hungry and it was an adequate amount for the both of us. We ordered the California Club flat bread pizza and also got their traditional chicken wings. The flat bread was some of the best I have ever had and it had many toppings. The wings was great with a spicy hot sauce for dipping which I enjoyed. The both of us also ordered their hand crafted sodas which were way better than your traditional sodas. Service could have been better as our waitress was busy with quite a few other tables and we had to wait awhile to place our food orders. Otherwise service was decent for the rest of our meal with them refilling our waters and checking up on us.  One other weird fact was that we were told that they had run out of burgers for the night since a couple people in our group had ordered them. What kind of restaurant chain runs out of burgers?? LOL.

But ok, maybe they're short-handed.  And clearly the nice hostess had the day off, since we got the snarky, kind of rude hostess. After about half an hour or so they seated us. Did they seat us at one of the empty tables? No, they took us to their porch, which was like 700 degrees and tried to put us literally next to a woman with a baby.  I don't mind babies, everyone was a baby, but I do mind being asked to sit *literally* on top of the baby's diaper bag. I was like ""uh, can we sit there?"" which was like 3 feet away and the lady rewarded me with a massive sigh. So we're sitting in this super noisy porch, which is 700 degrees and my fat bald head is under a heat lamp, so I'm like ""can we sit inside?"" And she's like ""you'll have to wait longer"" and I'm like ""what about those empty tables I am looking at with my rapidly-getting-less-satisfied eyes?"" And she walks away without saying anything. Literally.  So already, what the fuck. So I'm sitting there all mad, and my wife is getting mad because I'm mad (when I get mad, she gets mad at me, because she has a higher threshold for being treated like shit by a b-grade chain restaurant hostess) and my son is like ""I'm taking notes for therapy later"" -- he didn't say that, he just was instagramming really intently, but I could tell from his body language. I'm looking at the long and uninspired menu and finally, fifteen minutes later, just as the waitress approaches I'm like ""fuck this let's go"" So we get up. The waitress was like ""whoa, what's wrong"" which was pretty cool, and I was like ""this seating arrangement is not working,"" and she's like ""if you want to wait longer you can sit inside"" and I""m like ""what about those actual empty tables I am looking at right now with my never-going-to-enter-this-fucked-up-establishment-again eyes?""  And again, I don't even know how this is possible, but it's a pretty good trick, she refuses to acknowledge that there are 10+ empty tables mere feet away from us, So we left and went to Joey's next door, which I thought was going to be crazy expensive but actually was probably only 20% more.

We ended up ordering from the regular menu but it took about 15 mins until our waiter came to take our order. We finally got our food at 10pm and both of our entrées were lukewarm to cold. The waiter didn't bring out one of my side dishes so I had to ask but it also came cold so he had it remade. Granted, he did offer to make us fresh entrées as well, but we already waited 45 minutes for our food so we ate what we had. (And we HATE eating cold food, especially when we are paying almost $20 each for it.)   I ordered the parm chicken which had good flavor but it was cold and felt like I was eating leftovers.  My friend ordered a well done steak which was SUPER dry and hard.  It looked like the lung of a someone that's been smoking cigarettes for 80 years.  (I know you're going to think it's because she ordered it well-done, but we know how a properly cooked steak should be and this wasn't it.)  She even specifically told the waiter she didn't want it burned on the outside and have it be like cardboard.  She just wanted no pink in the middle. (She didn't request this in a snobby, picky-eater way.  She very politely explained what she meant.) The waiter sent the manager over and he apologized for forgetting the side dish and later had the waiter offer us a free dessert after our meal. We surprisingly declined because it was almost 11pm.  We would've preferred even a partial credit to our check or a gift card with a note, ""I'm sorry we suck at service like we usually do but come back again and experience our sucky service with hot food the next time around.)  ...but that didn't happen. The bar was only half full and the main dining room only had about 8 people by the time our food came. Employees were standing around chatting and we could hear loud talking and laughing from the kitchen. It made us feel like they weren't giving their customers enough attention.   I do like BJ's food but the service has never really been great. (Our waiter wasn't rude, just not up to par.)  Their service would honestly hold me back from eating here more often.  The wait staff doesn't really check on you and they are slow at fulfilling requests.  (He offered to give me a box for my food and it took him 15 mins to come back with it.)  We left very disappointed, which is unfortunate since me and my friend don't get together that often.  We should have went to Cheesecake Factory or Bahama Breeze.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=220

Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",293,689,138,2.0,4/7/2013,"Being freshly single and new to the area, I accepted a date even though he suggested it take place at a mall. I do not like malls. I dislike dates at malls even more. I am not 15, but whatever. I played ball. When he suggested we meet at BJ's my thoughts of cheapness and malls and not being 15 melded together into a giant ""meh"" as I rolled up. But I will rate the experience of the restaurant as best I can rather than the date. So yeah. BJ's Tukwila, here we go. Our server was pretty ticked off that we did not want to order a super-sized portion of everything carb-smothered from our 95 page menu the second we sat down. And so began his hissy fit stomp-off as he circled round us every 10 minutes for the rest of our visit. It was super fun like that. He actually slammed the door to the kitchen (I saw, because we were seated near the bar).  Once we finally placed our food order, he was visibly displeased and my date felt guilty and ordered an extra drink to compensate which seemed silly but whatever. It's BJ's. I'm sorry if you aren't making enough in tips. Mall restaurants tend not to pay that great; especially not when you're a jerk. So anyhow. You get the idea. The actual food and beverages consumed was on par with what you'd expect. Service needed an attitude check. I'm sure not every server there behaves like this, and it was just our unlucky night.

Kim V.,"Placerville, CA",60,211,86,2.0,8/29/2015,"Definitely not a fan of this restaurant, or at least this location. The service was slow, the food was wrong and cooked very poorly. Half of our table got their drinks before the other half was given the chance to order. I ordered mahi tacos that were a total mess: soggy tortillas and filling was all over the plate. The 6 tortilla chips it came with were translucent with oil (gross). My coworker ordered pasta that was so overcooked that it fell apart when she tried to pick it up with her fork. Several people in our party had their food mixed up (some with food allergies that couldn't eat what was brought out). The worst thing, however, was that after we ordered food, we placed an additional order for someone who was coming later, and they brought out the food for the later person before they brought out the food for person who was sitting there waiting for theirs....

Asked for a different table and told this was our only option because we had a baby and stroller. Good news, after my sour looks they finally washed and cleared a table inside the restaurant (right by the bathroom, so not really). However,  we were warned that the service might be spotty because someone had to come out of their section to wait on us. So far so good, beer is okay and the company is great! Ordered the bison burger with lots of special instructions so we shall see. Only a couple of issues with my meal ( no dressing for the salad,  didn't hold the bbq sauce on the burger, etc.) But tastes good.  My dining companions report dry chicken pesto sandwich (hint: order extra pesto, cause it is yummers). The double deluxe falls apart pretty fast and isn't worth the effort (maybe the pizza would be a good option).

We arrived just as they were opening for the day and we were probably the first table seated. We ordered within 5 minutes of arriving, but the food took almost half and hour to arrive. It was good, prepared correctly and the portions were really big. But the wait time was a bit frustrating... especially before a flight. I felt we had to rush thru the meal. I took my food with me in a box, but my parents were going to the airport so lots of the food was left behind due to timing issues and not wanting to hoark down our meals.

Malisa C.,"Auburn, WA",5,31,2,2.0,11/12/2014,"I came here last night with 5 other people for dinner before our movie & it was quite busy. Knowing how busy it was going to be, we called in ahead of time for a reservation. When we got to the place, I guess they have our table away, which was alright because we didn't even have to wait that long. I'd say about 15 minutes. Anyways, we got seated at our table, ordered our drinks and figured out what we wanted to order. Then all of a sudden, an employee comes rushing to our table and asks us how we ended up at this table because apparently, this table and the one next to it was reserved for another party that would be there soon. They asked us if we could move to another table and we did. Not going to lie, it was a bit embarrassing. However, our waitress was really friendly. We just didn't see much of her that night since it was really busy. We got our food 20 minutes later but some of us got pasta and couldn't eat because we didn't have forks. So that was another 5 minutes. Food was fine - nothing mind blowing.  Also, to get the discount movie ticket for amc, you don't just give them your bjs receipt. Make sure you ask you waiter about this & they're supposed to give you a gold movie ticket. Unfortunately, we couldn't get them because I didn't know.

BJ's has a nicer sports bar feel to it.  There are multiple televisions with various sports on them.  A ginormous screen centered behind the bar seems to be tuned to the most relevant game at the time.  The clientele seems to be a mesh of locals and out-of-towners, and the service from behind the bar couldn't have been better.

However, there were multiple instances in which I had pretty uncooked noodles in my pasta which wasn't the greatest, but that is hard to avoid, I do it all the time when I make pasta at home!

Danny -.,"Renton, WA",0,13,,2.0,3/15/2016,"I go to BJs fairly often and love their food, but this location is slowly turning me off the brand. The BJs chain has awesome food, and this location is no different, but my last 3 times at this location, the service has been brutal, and the food has become seemingly more and more disappointing.  I'm only going to mention my most recent visit, as it left me with a bad taste after years of loving this place. I went with my friend and we met at that restaurant fairly late at night. When we arrived, I'd say there were maybe 9 tables with about 20 patrons total so by no means was it busy. We walk in and there is no one at the host station. We contemplate sitting in the bar area to seat ourselves, but neither of us are fans of the bar areas at restaurants. So we wait what felt like an eternity, but was really about 7 minutes before a girl finally notices that we exist. She walks up to us, doesn't say anything, and just kind of glares at us expecting us to say something. A fairly sour greeting I should say. We ask for a table and her reply is ""ok, let me find you one."" She walks away to the basically empty restaurant, comes back after 2 minutes and says ""follow me."" Finally, we are seated. So we sit there looking over the menus, and I see a couple servers walking by us multiple times. We wait... And wait... And about another 10 minutes go by and finally a server who walked by us multiple times and definitely saw us there comes up for our drink order. We tell him we are ready to order (as we are already tired of waiting around) and he says ok hold on. He walks away, comes back after a few minutes (no drinks in hand) and takes our orders. After taking our order, he comes back with drinks finally a couple minutes later.  So as if it wasn't bad enough, it only gets worse from here. We noticed a table near us with two people who looked bored out of their minds. They hadn't eaten yet clearly, and at one point our server walked by and they stopped him and asked how much longer it would be for the food as they have been waiting over 30 minutes. Upon hearing that conversation I realized we really probably just should have walked away when no host came up at the start.  So more than 40 minutes goes by and no food. Finally our server runs over, drops off our food, and starts walking away without saying a word. We needed refills and had no silverware or napkins so I have to uncomfortably loudly yell for him to come back. He quickly brings us napkins, however he seemed to clearly forget the refills as we never saw him again until after we finished our food. Speaking of the food, as always, it was delicious, which is why my review is a 2 star instead of 1 star, HOWEVER, the portions of food are significantly smaller than in the past, which is another thing that's disappointing. Usually I'm so full I can't decide if I can stomach a Pizookie after. This time, I was still starving after finishing my food, but so sick of waiting and this awful service that I just decided to pay my bill and leave and grab a milkshake at McDonald's for dessert.  Anyway, there's my review. I genuinely hope BJs management goes on Yelp and reads reviews and can use this to better train their staff and better serve their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=260

Ick. The shoestring fries were edible and the wedge fries were similar to what you'd fine in the Safeway deli.  The turkey sandwich was nothing to write home about.   The manager was apologetic but did not offer to comp a meal or give us a free dessert.  I really expected a scoop of ice cream or SOMETHING, but I don't think this restaurant cares about return business or customer satisfaction.   When our server brought the bill she suggested we sign up for the loyalty program.  Yeah right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=260
Olystacy B.,"Olympia, WA",90,725,369,3.0,6/17/2014,"6 of us stopped by for an late/lunch early dinner around 3 pm last Saturday.  The restaurant was half full but there were several of us in line waiting to be seated. It took 20 minutes to be seated, which was a little off putting. We couldnt figure out why they wouldnt have scheduled more staff on a Saturday and a Saturday with many watching the World Cup.  The bar was full of soccer fans.  Seems like whoever was responsible for scheduling/staffing was behind the 8 ball. Anyway, service was very slow and disjointed.  We had to wait to get our water, our drinks, and acknowledgement of us even sitting at the table took about 10 minutes. Food was excellent and our server was friendly albeit disorganized.  We had to repeat our order to him 3 times because he wasn't writing it down. WHY do servers do this? Why not just write it down and get it right the first time?  It doesnt impress me that you have a 50/50 memory - impress me by getting right the first time and not having to ask me numerous times to confirm you have a short memory? Food took a long time to come out and then came out in different increments which is always annoying.  One of the kids had to wait about 10  minutes after  everyone else had received their food. Side salads were very small for the price. Deep dish pizza was outstanding with great flavor and crispy buttery crust., pretty steep prices though. All told we were there for an hour and forty five minutes for what should have been a quick bite to eat on a Saturday afternoon between typical busy times.  The manager (I assume - don't know) came by and apologized for the very long wait but didn't comp anything off the bill. I am undecided - I don't know if we would go back.  It was good but I dont know if it was good enough to go  back, pay steep prices for not so great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=260

But BJ's is known for their brew, so that's why a lot of the time that I do come here, one of the guys always wants beer. This place is big, but not huge. sometimes, the tables are close together where people often stare at you, and/or it's SUPER LOUD. But our server was great. I love having good jokes with the waiter and he was just that... he was funny & played along with our jokes. He was actually good. He told jokes, checked in often, and was friendly. Didn't go out of his way for things, but honestly he was a damn good waiter.  I can't remember which drink I got. It was some kind of Sangria that was supposed to be made by one of the BJ's workers. But it was SO weak. It's supposed to be one of the ""stronger"" drinks but it was whack! I tasted some wine, but that was it. NOT strong at all. It was more fruity than anything. I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered their wonton and mini bruschetta. I actually really enjoyed their wontons & bread. It was small, worth the cheap prices and tasty. I also tasted the stuffed mushrooms which were sooo goood! I enjoyed that. I've had their tomato and cheese salad, I think. And that was good too. Normally, I always get the chicken fried steak here. I think it's good, but not the best. At times, dry & bland, but the gravy makes it taste all better.  I rate this place 3/5 stars because of the food, overall.

We started out with the avocado rolls as an appetizer.  They were a hit but I didn't try them because they were ruined by the inclusion of cream cheese.  Our table's orders included pasta, a burger, sandwiches, and a salad.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and either finished it or took home leftovers.  My Toscano pasta was just OK.  The mix of ingredients sounded promising (tomatoes, feta, red onions, parmesan) but it was rather bland and the pasta was overcooked.  The chicken was good though with a nice amount of char.  My BF's Cajun pasta with shrimp was much more flavorful.  I tried both the shoestring and wedge fries and they were both really good.   I doubt I'll ever be back to BJs but wouldn't rule it out if I had to eat at the mall again. I didn't have very high expectations for mall/chain food and it delivered about what I expected but with slightly better service.

Mark G.,"Seattle, WA",181,100,204,2.0,12/3/2014,I've been here a few times for work lunches.  This place is good for seating a large amount of people but that is about it.  The service is not very good and the food is very mediocre.  I've had the pizza here (not very good) as well as the chicken tacos lunch special (not enough food).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=280
Ellissa M.,"Federal Way, WA",18,9,4,2.0,2/12/2015,"Came here with my boyfriend after we both got off work to grab a late lunch. It was about 3:30 and pretty slow. We got drinks in a decent amount of time then ordered our steaks. Finished our first round of drinks, started on our second, food still not out. So we're both sitting there real curious what happened to our medium rare and medium steaks since at this point it's been 25 minutes when we ask what's up with our food, new bartender says she'll have our bartender go check on it since she just came on.  Our bartender said they were platting our food up now. A few minutes our steaks came out.  My fork had some dried food that survived the dishwasher on it, I stated such, was offered no new silverware, cut into steak, it was fine. Taste wise, Eehhhh but we were starving as we both had just got off work. So we are our food. Bartender let us know she was getting off and would be closing out with us. Sure, we will close out.  Here's my issue. I work in the service industry, was wearing my work clothes when I came in. When you let my drink be empty for 5 minutes before you ask if we want another, no no. My food taking 35 minutes, especially since it was a medium and a medium rare steak, uhm... No again. No apologies were offered at all or any explanation, which would have made it acceptable. On top of that, letting me know you're closing me out, nope. Should've asked me and given me the option, which I would've closed out anyway like we were told to do, letting me know that's what you're doing, not okay.  I haven't been into BJ's for about a month before this, service was always on point before. Not sure what was going on today, maybe my appearance was not the usual dressy black clothes, just jeans and a work t-shirt and my boyfriend in construction clothes, but the service should have been the same.  I'm honestly kind of like damn, that sucks. Usually it's much better. As I told my boyfriend, who wondered why I chose this place verses all our other choices, since he had never been. Maybe just an off day. Let's hope so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=280

The dessert they are famous for is at best  ""average"", The service at this location and the newst one in Redmond, WA is TERRIBLE. I would never go back. The management is also incapable of resolving issues.  FIRST after waiting 30 min for table, our waiter forgot one of our guests meals, then when it finally came out it was completely wrong order. Then when they tried to fix it a second time it was still incorrect. So we complained to the manager who offered us a free dessert to apologize but we ended up waiting another hour only to find out the waiter never put that order either. The total amount of time spent here was almost 3 hours to not even get a meal. The manager never offered to comp the meal or follow through to make sure we were taken care of.

The hostesses and servers are usually pretty nice, but sometimes (rarely) it feels like they just want to go home, which is understandable considering how busy this place can be.

The meat on the burgers were dry and weren't even formed into a nice round patty.  More like a blob of gobble-y blob.  There was cheese the size of a booger.  The pasta was spicy but no other flavor.  Even the service blew like a bad BJ -- from getting a table, to getting our food took forever & it was 2 in the afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=280

Our waters were filled every so often and kept getting asked if we needed anything and so forth. I ordered the Double Deluxe Burger and a house salad. The food was alright nothing very spectacular for my taste buds but the burger was overall good. The potatoe wedges were a nice option instead of your usual skinny fries which still are an option.

Waitress informed that it was happy hour cause there was a football game going on, which was nice even though their HH food menu is very limited. We order the chicken wings and a mini deep dish pizza off the HH. The wings were good but you only get like 5 pieces, which is not worth it. I got the chicken bacon ranch pizza which was good but kind of soggy cause ranch was drenched on top.. We also ordered the cajun pasta off the regular menu. It was okay. We had to use some tobasco to bring some spice into the dish. The pasta was cold too and the bread sticks it came with was ROCK hard. Disappointed so I asked for new breadsticks, which our waitress got us fresh ones right away.  I've been to this location many times, its a hit or miss, depending on what food you get.

We were seated right away, despite it looking pretty crowded and being behind a few parties. They moved us to a booth on request, and the service was prompt and thoughtful, and best of all- speedy. Ordered two flatbread pizzas (margherita and pesto chicken) and two salads (caesar and house) along with long island iced teas. Granted, I am a lush; given, I drink a fair amount. These long islands were average priced (9.50 a piece) and tasty, but sadly lacking in liquor. I choose a long island because it is chock full of the good stuff, and if I am paying 10 bucks a glass mostly full of ice, I want it to pack a punch.  Although the food was great and service stellar, BJs loses major points with this gal for scrimping on the good stuff.  Almost redeemed a star when friend's salad arrived and we got our entrees before we had to remind server about my salad, which she immediately comped for us.

Jason S.,"Poulsbo, WA",43,86,55,2.0,10/22/2013,"BJ's left me unimpressed.  The food was mediocre and the beer okay.  The service we received was less than desirable. The two beers I tried, the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA.  Both beers lacked anything memorable.  The Nutty Brewnette is supposed to be a brown ale but lacked any significant hints of the nutty flavor described.  The Hopstorm IPA was just not ""hoppy"" as I like IPAs to be. For dinner, I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger.  I was average at best.  The meat was obviously frozen and then thawed which caused the burger to lack any juiciness.  The jalapeños were those tangy ones that sit in a jar of vinegar instead of being spicy like you'd notice in fresh ones.  It is nothing to rave about. As for the service, I really wish owners would stress how much of a difference a smile can (or lack of one) can make.  Our server was either tired or grumpy or both.  She lacked the attention to detail required to notice that there were four of us and only two sets of utensils.  She didn't know anything about the restaurant's participation in the Washington Beer Lovers club.  The only time she was somewhat friendly was when she dropped the check off. Overall, BJ's seems to get quite a lot of business.  Most of the crowd seemed to be teenagers enjoying their homecoming night.  I would let the teens have this one and recommend adults find better food and better beer elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=280

No rearranging necessary.  Leaf lettuce, swiss, avocado, roma tomatoes and a slather of mayo.  Although I was fairly full eating half the sandwich and a handful of fries, I shoved the rest down the gullet since it wouldn't be good later.  My friend said the french dip was delicious with the horseradish sauce and tasty au jus.

We were there before those other parties, one of which was a larger party than ours.  I waited a few minutes then went back up to ask the hostess how long it would be. All she said was that the computers were down. She had a piece of paper where she put names down but did not even bother to ask me for my name to put it down. She completely ignored me and faced the other way until I left. No apologies or anything! Our server was nice to tell us that the computers were down and the food might take longer since they have to manually write the orders. I appreciate that but she was not writing down correctly! I ordered my son orange juice and she came back with apple juice. I asked for my burger to be well down and it was pink inside. Of course she was nowhere to be found.

The hospitality industry is not something anyone can do, although many try and I understand there are personalities out there that can not be satisfied, even with the best of disposition.

The food was always great and even when it was busy, I never use to wait over 30 minutes for my meal. Recently it's changed. I had dinner here last night and would have say it was the worse experience I have had here. It was busy so I knew the service was going to be slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow. As my friend and I got our table, we ordered 2 small plates first to start off the night. As we sat, 3 other couples came and were seated around us. Tell me why they got their appetizers before my friend and I got ours? Oh because our waiter hardly ever came to check on us.  Though our waiter was nice and friendly, we felt as though we weren't given any attention at all. We finally ordered our meals and got our small plates which were good. Now the wait begins. The three couples that got seated way after us all recieved their food. My friend and I looked at each other and was like ""wtffffff?"" and of course our waiter saw what happened. We were going to tell him to cancel our meals because we had other plans but he rushed back out with our plates and told us ""sorry to have made you wait. THe deep fried onions that goes on your plate is still being cooked right now and I will bring it out once it's done."" Deep fried onions?? Ain't that the first and fastest thing to be cooked on the chicken balsalmic dish? I ordered the Tuscan chicken limone and I have to say, my dish just didn't taste right. Plus you can tell that it's been sitting under the heater for some time because the sauce had dried up on the plate and on my pasta. I had it sent back and replaced with the chicken alfredo. I can totally tell that my waiter was getting annoyed of me. Maybe I should have said something like ""IT'S BEEN ALMOST AN HOUR AND WE'RE STILL WAITING ON OUR FOOD."" When I receieved my dish, many of the noodles were still hard! I pretty much lost my appetite and took all of it to go.  I may be venting too much about my meal but if you're going to serve and cater to the customers, do it right. I didn't want to be the annoying rude customers so I bit my tongue, paid for the meals and left. I don't think I will be returning since this isn't the first time service and the food has been like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=340

No smile, no friendly talk, no personality, they almost looked bothered you sat at their bar top.. My advice, train your bartenders on the qualities of exceptional customer service which includes smiling and the occasional ""how's your day today?"" - anywhere I go I can get my drink poured and placed in front of me.

There were only five of us in our party spits not like we had a terribly huge order either. Asking for water took three tries from three different people.

Amy M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",99,453,407,4.0,9/9/2009,I discovered BJ's after living in SoCal for a year & a half and I was thrilled to see there was one up here now.  The menu here in Seattle has a much larger selection that the ones in Orange County and I was tempted to try something that wasn't pizza but BJ's knows how to scratch my BBQ Chicken Pizza itch just right! I love it and sometimes I think I should try making it at home but then I think why bother? I will just go to BJ's! We also got the lettuce shrimp wraps that my friend said were pretty tasty - I thought they looked pretty.  For some reason I found myself noticing that everyone working there kind of moved in slo-mo. Like they were just out for a Sunday afternoon drive. I wasn't in a hurry and the place wasn't very busy but it made me wonder what it is like when it does get busy.

The service is half-assed better than previous visits, but only because they're more persistent  - not because they're actually providing good service.  A friend ordered a glass of wine and the waitress came back with a beer.  She had an attitude about it too.  ""What, is beer not okay?""  Seriously?!  Here's an idea: Maybe you should bring the patrons what they ask for, and not what you think they should have.  Or maybe, just maybe, because you screwed up, you should offer to give the guy the beer and hurry off to get him the wine he ordered.  Just saying.  If it wasn't for the fact that we had a big group and she was guaranteed a tip, I would've taken that beer straight out of her tip. And left her nothing. But really, the service wasn't the biggest issue.  The problem would have been the food poisoning that both my husband and I got.  Nothing like hugging the porcelain bowl all night long.  Thankfully, our infant son was in another room and can sleep through the night, because there was no way either one of us was in good enough condition to tend to him. How do I know it was my dinner that gave me the food poisoning?  Because it's the only meal both of us had eaten together in 2 days.   Yes, no more BJ's for me.  Bad service and food poisoning in one visit would be the final straw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=320
Razel M.,"Seattle, WA",149,256,44,2.0,3/25/2013,"I've never really had a problem with BJ's. I mean sure, it's a chain restaurant, and they don't really have a specialty aside from their beer. But it was the kind of place you could go for fairly decent food where everyone would find something they liked. And there are pizookies, of course. My experience today kinda ruined all that for me. We went for a coworker's birthday lunch. Usually for these things, 1.5 hours is enough. Well, not at BJ's. Long story short, we waited so long for our food that some of us had to ask for it boxed up because we had meetings to go to. Thank goodness I had a small (non amazing) bruschetta appetizer to tide me over until my meeting ended. Then I ate my food and was even more upset because what the hell, it wasn't worth the wait. I had got the Tuscan Limone Chicken pasta, which was supposed to have a lemon butter sauce. There was no lemon in the sauce -- and the pasta was overcooked, and seemed that they had rushed it so much that they didn't even drain it properly. My sauce was watery with a very slight hint of butter. One of my coworkers ended up with the same watery pasta, so she ended up eating the shrimp off her scampi and tossing the rest. I hate when I pay so much for food that I can cook better at home. I hate when I pay for food that leaves me so unsatisfied I end up searching high and low the rest of the afternoon for other food that would erase the literal bad taste in my mouth and make me feel satiated.  And, as someone who works in the service industry, I hate when service-oriented places like restaurants don't take responsibility. The rest of our party had ended up waiting hella long for their bills to come out and were told, ""Oh sorry, it's because you asked for separate checks."" No word of apology about the food taking hella time to come out, no apology for the state of the food when it came, and tried to pass on the blame to the customer. That was the last straw for me. Because of pizookies (which, oh, I didn't even have time to eat today), and the good root beer, and previous okay experiences, BJ's gets to keep 2 stars.

Let's start with the beer (my favorite part).  If you are a beer enthusiast than this brewery delivers some of my favorites. Especially that Jeremiah's red which is a Irish style strong ale. Doesn't matter if you're into IPAs, porters, stouts or even lagers they have some good stuff.  Even seasonal beers that'll get you hop'n. See what I did there? Now the food. Nothing there really screams ""must have!"" But don't expect to be able to successfully watch your calories eating here either. Even their salads are hefty. Burgers are huge. And pizza is mediocre.

The food this time (for the record, I had the burger melt, same as before) was immaculate. Presentation was great and the taste was amazing. A burger melt may be tough to screw up but even tougher to perfect, and I was shocked to learn given my prior experience here that BJ's had finally done the latter. I'd definitely recommend this place now that significant changes were made (though the restroom stalls were once again missing the gentle caress of Scott tissue...)

I don't know..too many times just killed it for me..No sense of urgency, no anticipating guests needs, reading the table properly and no genuine care from our servers when we dined in. My sister was standing for over 10minutes at their to-go station and no one helped her when a lot of the staff were just standing together laughing and chit chatting not putting the customer first.  no matter how good the food is in front of me, eating it mad/pissed/disappointed doesn't make it any better..This really ruins it for me, especially if i'm paying a little bit more than normal, i should be expecting good service at least.

My seat was dirty with food from the previous customers so I asked her for a napkin to clean it (after I said I would cause I felt bad if she did since I usually don't like waiters going out of their way to do things like that even though it is their job) I had to repeat myself 3 times for her to semi understand what I was trying to say so I just said can I have a napkin? Then she came back with one napkin saying ""This was the only napkin I could find."" LOLOLOL I mean please there's no way...

Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,4.0,4/30/2013,"We've eaten here dozens of times but I've never bothered to Yelp it... hmmm. I suspect it's because we often eat here on the way home from the airport; I work in my company's Washington, DC, office one week out of every six to eight weeks, and given that there's nothing gluten-free offered on the plane, I'm usually tired AND starving when I get to baggage claim. We are usually hitting BJ's after the dinner rush since my plane lands at 9:30 pm Friday nights. That means we avoid the usual very long waits for a table most of the time, but we've come often enough at dinnertime for me to testify to the waits... ugly. Go shopping! I am a big fan of the giant stuffed baked potatoes (butter, bacon, and cheddar cheese only for me). I also like the balsamic-glazed chicken. My husband likes most of it but tends to stick to their giant salads. My son keeps trying the tiny corndogs and keeps not liking them LOL though he does like the smiley-face fries.  ALL of their french fry options have gluten. Be aware. Service is often half-assed here. We've had long waits for food, mistakes on food, and even mistakes on beverages. That costs them a half to a solid star for me... I'll give them the fourth star now because everything's been correct the last two times we've been. The chain is opening a branch in Redmond soon and since that's much closer to us, I suspect our days of driving to Tukwila to eat here are over, though we probably will continue to do the late-Friday thing when I get home from DC.

He took our drink orders, which was a few beers, a lemon aide for the kid and 2 root beers. Nothing complicated. 10 Min's later, he comes back with most everything but the kid drink.

Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,3.0,4/25/2011,"I've been going to BJ's for almost 2 years (when they first opened in WA until now). I used to frequent the Tacoma, WA location as I had friends who lived nearest to that location. When it opened in Tukwila it saved me about another 25 miles down I-5. The thing I used to like about BJ's was that they had a decent happy hour (half-off pizzas, some $ off drinks and it was extended until 7pm). The last time I was there (a few months ago), it seems the happy hour menu has been trimmed down. As someone who does go out socially frequently with different sets of friends or family, happy hour is something that I do look for when I go out. It helps cut down on the cost of food/drinks as well as offers a better chance to have the restaurant full and not half-empty. BJ's is still a decent place to hang out and not wait for a table (it's never super busy) but the prices are a little on the spendy side for some entrees (I usually get their soup/salad combo). The food itself is good but the service is usually poor (a waitress is overwhelmed or just doesn't care). They have big screen TV's so it's a definite 'substitute' for a sports bar and can be used as such but average bill is $20+/pp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=360

It had obviously been made fresh at the end of that 30 minutes, so where was our original pizookie? And why did it take 20 minutes after we gave our server our pizookie order for her to check and see if we had gotten it? Obviously not, because it wasn't sitting in front of us!!! And apparently their software just crashed so we also have to sit here and wait for our check. To be honest, I'm not feeling the love tonight. I'll definitely think twice before I come back - I'll have to wait a while to forget this experience.

My friend and I went as a sort of going away dinner for her, and we were initially pleased to see that they had decent prices considering the area. We ended up getting two appetizers, an entree, and dessert without breaking the bank. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, I enjoyed the fact that they weren't just stuffed with parmesan cheese and salt. The mac n cheese was dang tasty too, the addition of chunks of bacon certainly helped.  We also got the buffalo chicken pizza, which as one reviewer said wasn't particularly overflowing with toppings compared to how much bread there was. Still, it was good, tasted like wings on a pizza. And who doesn't love things smothered with ranch dressing.  We finished the meal with a red velvet ""pizookie"", their sort of signature pizza-cookie dessert thing. Oh God. It. Was. Heavenly. Gobs of vanilla ice cream melting over a hot pan of red velvet cookie with cream cheese frosting bits? Yes please.  While the food was great, I am dinging one star due to a rather bored and non-engaging waiter along with the almost impposible to get refills.

I've been to this place a handful of times, and I always leave wondering why I chose BJ's in the first place.  Oh yeah now I remember...I've got friends who have the misfortune of living south of Seattle, so when we want to get together, we generally choose to meet in the Southcenter vicinity. Most of the restaurants around there, besides being chains, either don't offer happy hour or end their HH before 7 pm. Hence, we always find ourselves at BJ's. BJ's isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. Their beers aren't memorable, and neither is the food. The last time I was there with a girl friend of mine, we got awkwardly hit on by some weirdo. Did BJ's become a meat market for the south end without me getting the memo? It just feels so contrived for that sort of thing, but then I looked around and realized we may have been the last to know. This is obviously not BJ's fault, but being practically ignored by the servers and waiting 35 minutes for shrimp lettuce wraps IS their issue. Oh, and since when does $1 off drinks and $2 off overpriced appetizers constitute happy hour specials? I guess I've just been spoiled living in Seattle within walking distance to some amazing places. Anyways, I wish someone would recommend a good local place that has reasonable happy hour times to meet friends south of Seattle.

Sorry but it's your job to accommodate guests, not pick on them. Food was mediocre. Kinda greasy. Bland. My pizza tasted like a mini 'pizza hut' pizza I could get for $5 at Target.

I ordered an appetizer called Frito Nachos & it was pretty much what it sounds like: nachos made with Fritos. Too much cheese & too little Fritos & chili made about half of it too soupy to eat. But at that point it was free, so what the hey. I also had a scrumptious ""No Guilt Cosmo"" to drink that  was so good I wondered if they used the sugar ingredients instead of the sugar-free. It was good though & I didn't ask if it was really ""Guilt Free"" because we had other problems of a service nature by that time.  My son ordered a sandwich & asked to substitute a Ceasar salad for the house salad that came with it. The server said sure & a Ceasar salad arrived in short order. When they brought out his sandwich a while later, there sat a house salad along side it. The server apologized & said he was getting both salads.  Awesome, right? Not one to look a gift salad in the mouth, he asked for some honey mustard dressing to go with it.   In the mean time, my husband's sandwich arrived along with steak fries. He asked the server if she could bring him some tarter sauce for his fries when she brought out the dressing for our son.  So we dug in, more or less. Problem was neither the dressing or tarter sauce arrived. My husband, who was already annoyed about his wife being wounded by the shard of glass was not happy. The server finally stopped by to see how we were doing, and he reminded her about the missing condiments. She apologized and went to get them. We thought that was where she was going but it wasn't a quick trip.  By the time she came back, he had eaten a lot of the naked fries. She asked him if he would like more fries that would be ""warm"" to have with the tarter sauce (so she realized the fries were probably cold by this time) but he declined.

Their menu has a flash of comfort food mixed with select Italian entrees, gourmet burgers and a specialty dessert that has me looking at my car keys and planning my trip.  The bar area is a great place for men and women alike but because this BJ's is attached to Southcenter, it becomes a hideaway of sorts. Every devoted husband starts losing focus after our wives stare and tries on the same shoe for longer than 15 minutes. Honestly, just buy it and move on. Anyways, BJ's has its own brewed beers and flat screens which means we can escape the shopping madness, watch a couple games, try some seasonal beers and enjoy some appetizers.

Notable was their inability to serve any food without dousing it in sugar, from the glaze on the steak to the syrupy chicken lettuce wrap filling. Steak was overly gristly and well under mid rare: better than overdone, but still, it's steak - it ain't that hard to not do wrong. Our server was helpful and tried to be attentive even though he was deep in the weeds.

I've actually been here a couple of times when they first opened and remember the food was at the level of Cheesecake factory and they do have yummy sodas like the Orange Twist, etc. However, came here yesterday to celebrate Father's Day with my parents, and boy was it just plain awful. The Food: Full Rack of Ribs with Salad & Baked Potato  - The ribs were so dry and not well cooked that I could barely cut the ribs with a  steak knife. Asked for some BBQ sauce but the taste was too off, also way too salty. Basic salad with some croutons (Like what you would get from a salad kit from Safeway) and just got a regular baked potato, no butter, etc. Turkey Club with Thin Fries It was like eating a salt-lick, nuff said... Medium Sweet Pig Pizza: This was the worst of the worst, even way below the standards of Pizza Hut or Dominoes. It was essentially 98% dough, 2% cheese and toppings. There were barely any toppings for a $20 pizza, some small dobs of tomato sauce, very thinly sliced pieces of ham and bits of pineapple. It was like eating a very oily, greasy piece of bread, just plain horrible. The Service: They were not busy but a bit too slow, waited 15 minutes to get BBQ sauce for my dry ribs. we only got one re-fill. Still left a 15% tip because it will be the last cent BJ's will ever get from me. Overall, they need to remove the restaurant out of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse... And no, we didn't complain to management, we just had a lot of left-overs. I'll leave the yelling to Gordon Ramsey. + I remember them being quite busy when they first opened, but now you don't need to call ahead anymore to get a table + Come here for the nice sodas - Horrible Food - Slow Service Tip: STAY AWAY!

When you try to appeal to everyone and the kitchen sink your food quality is going to go down. This doesn't seem to affect large chain restaurants as much as smaller mom and pop places, but I still think it has some effect on this place. As for my food, I ordered a jalapeno burger, and aside from the unusually vast amounts of red onions it was pretty good, and the prices are pretty much that of red robin. If you get fries, make sure they're the crispy thin ones! In regards to the service, not impressed at all with the waiter that handled our table. The only time I ever saw him was when he took our orders, and walked by to drop off the bill.

We were eventually seated and I really don't know what the issue in seating us was considering all the tables along the wall were empty and to me it looked like there still was plenty of seating. Unfortunately, the group of 16 was seated in the tables next to me and my friend.  I can only describe them as very loud and obnoxious women who must not have ever eaten in a restaurant or their parents didn't have the common sense to teach them how to act in a restaurant as well as dress appropriately.  They shouted to each other and everything they saw like a ""OH WOW"".  They were so loud my friend and I had a hard time talking.   In all my visits to BJs, the one thing I have found irritating is that the server never asks if we'd like anything else before they bring our check.  We always get our check when we plan on ordering more food, dessert or another drink.  My friends and I have  yet to come out with only one check.  Usually multiple checks.  One time my friend came out with at least nine checks because each time she ordered something, the server would close out her check.  I usually come out with two and one time I came out with three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=380

Yes, one birthday party inside the restaurant with plenty of empty seating compared to the compact space outside with a birthday party.  Anyhow, she moved us directly right next to the party. I was extremely upset and pissed off that she completely ignored my prior request of why I didn't want to sit outside in the first place.  Of course I am going to be asked to be moved again.

When they recently built locations in Tacoma and Tukwila, I went many times for dinner in small and large groups. Most recently I went earlier this week to grab beers with a friend. We got the pumpkin ale and it's one of the best beers I've ever had. Right amount of pumpkin spices and hops. After our first beers, we decided to order the nachos.  What I noticed when I ate them was a trend that I no longer like how their food tastes. In the last couple years I've had sandwiches, tacos, pizzas and now nachos. Everything tastes mediocre and nauseating. Nothing seems fresh or original, just greasy, greasy, greasy! The nachos sounded like they would be delicious, per the description: piranha ale chili, sour cream, green onions, cheese, salsa, jalapenos, etc. But you couldn't really taste the chili because it was buried under too many SALTY chips and greasy cheese. We realized halfway through that there was no sour cream on them, which would've made a difference. The salsa though was phenomenal and was our favorite part of the nachos. On this night, we had a server who was AWESOME. Friendly, appeared when we needed her and gave us plenty of time to chat and hang out without making us feel pressure to order anything or leave. I will be back for more pumpkin ale soon, but will stay away from the nachos. The pizzas there are your best bet, by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=400

We actually got a table before a family that came in before us? hmmmm... no biggie, they actually ended up sitting behind us and actually got their food first...  My first experience of BJ's was in Nor Cal, we stopped by BJ's at like 10 or 11 at night after driving two hours from a car show in the Bay Area. I placed third, it was definitely time to celebrate!!

I don't remember what I ate or how it tasted because I was so tired. But I didn't have anything to complain about. They seated us quickly and got us served. It was pretty empty however. Last night's experience was a bit different. We waited about 25 minutes or so for our table and then probably another 25 to get our food. During our wait for the table, I walked inside to use the bathroom. I noticed a few tables that were not seated, awkward? Why not just seat us in them? Well, I noticed a very large party dining inside as well, probably about 20 people. I'm assuming, they didn't seat us because they wanted this table to get their food first. No biggie. We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and Grilled chicken pasta. I'd say I like the Parmesan crusted chicken more than the pasta. The pasta came a little dry, but our waiter easily got us some extra white sauce when we asked!! Very nice and helped to gobble the pasta down.  The restaurant is nice. Ambiance is mellow.

The bacon cheeseburger was good but nothing special really.  The bun was different and pretty good, the meat was decent but kind of flavorless and the wasn't as crispy as I was hoping.  But the veggies were fresh and everything was warm a gooey like it should.  the wedge fries were good too. The personal pizzas look good too however they are a little on the small side.   Overall the food looked pretty good and the brews that I tried were great.  They make a pretty good seasonal pumpkin ale if you are into that sort of thing.

It must be this location because I've been to other BJ's where the service has been great. Not here. :( First off, when I went it wasn't crowded and pretty empty, yet it took the host 5 minutes to seat us. It's not that hard. Look for an empty section that doesn't overwhelm the staff and seat us. Strike one. Next, my friends and I wait for about 10m for the waitress to arrive for drink orders. Mind you, by that time, we're all ready to order. We place our food and drink orders and the waitress leaves and doesn't come back with drinks for another 10 minutes. My friend had a very flat and unsweet soda. Tasted like Perrier. Took forever to get any attention from the waitress or staff. While we're waiting, we see the booth in front of us has the manager talking to them because the waitress fouled up their order big time. A sign of things to come?? Strike two. I also noticed the group who sat before us, had their food out come fairly quick so I was expecting the same. Not a chance. They had 6 people in their party and we had 3. It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. The food was good, but the horrible service made us want to scarf the food down and leave, never to return. Strike three. I can understand if the restaurant is at full capacity, but the waitress only had about 3 tables to wait on. If anything, she should do a round every once in a while to check up on things. She only did once and that was towards the end of our meal. Also, it took forever for us to get the check and when it was time to pay, my friend had to walk into the kitchen to look for the waitress to deliver the card. Strike four? lol This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in any restaurant. What should have been a 30-45 minute affair, took us nearly two hours.

My husband & I had our rehearsal dinner here a few years back. Very reasonably priced and everyone had a great time. If you go...save room for the pizookie. Trust me.

Jarad S.,"Newcastle, WA",5,18,2,1.0,1/13/2013,"I used to go to this place a lot. As of now I can't even think why I did. Went here last night and ordered some beer appetizers to start off...After waiting 25 minutes for some brushcetta we asked about our beers and she had totally forgotten. Whatever, she's just a little flustered maybe even though it wasn't that busy. We then order our meals and it literally takes 50 minutes till she comes and apologizes for the wait and gives us a free small caesar salad. The couple next to us had been sitting for 15 minutes and hadn't even received any menus, so they left.  A few minutes later they bring out my deep dish medium pizza - which, by the way isn't even deep dish anymore it is essentially pan pizza...they don't even use the black pans anymore. I told her that I ordered a deep dish and not a hand tossed and she said that is just how they make their pizzas now and had no idea why so essentially it's just a lot of dry fluffy dough. Then, I realize the pizza is completely the wrong order with none of the toppings I asked for. By the time I finally get my pizza my friends are done with their food so it's pretty pointless now...yet again, another issue - they didn't put sauce on it! I asked my waitress and she brought me a rameken of marina to dip my pizza in I guess? It tasted like DiGiorno frozen pizza and marinara sauce, and she brought it to me COLD! Pizza with no sauce and cold marinara to dip it in? Gross. I had my friends try and they agreed it was terrible. I've had their deep dish pizzas when they used to make them the good way but I will NEVER be going back with my family or friends and will tell everyone I know to steer away from this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440

I can't rate it as A-OK cause it wasn't an A-OK experience so I had to go with two stars. We came during an afternoon lull.  No wait.  They seated us outside.  It was a bit chilly, but we had jackets.   Our waiter appeared to have a couple of tables. He took a drink order.  I order iced tea and requested sweetener.  (Why don't waitstaff just automatically bring it when they bring ice tea to a table?)   He brought the water for the others and my iced tea.  No sweetener.  I asked again.  I was very thirsty but I'm not wanting to drink unsweetened iced tea.  We waited.  He served another table their food, walked past us and we tried to flag him down again he told us to ""hold it"" and rolled his eyes as he walked all the way down, got them ketchup and walked all the way back.  Then came asking if we were ready for apps.  I said I wanted the sweetener and then we'd talk food.  He said okay tossing his head back for another eye roll. stopped at the other two tables, started to take an order and at that point I lost it.  I went for a manager.  Told them the situation.  By then I'd my iced tea had been sitting 10 minutes.  I'm usually fairly easy going but this one got me.  I requested another waitperson.  Lauren did fine for us the rest of the meal.   We did get some glares from the original waiter.  I found it interesting that after those other tables cleared out we did not see him again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440
Jules H.,"Seattle, WA",2,26,1,1.0,5/16/2013,"Blech, there's a reason I've never gone into BJs and today solidified why. My visiting Midwestern coworkers didn't get enough to eat at Blue C and wanted to get these cookie-pizza dessert things down the way at BJs. Sure I'll go with and have a drink but I actually consider sushi a dinner.  We get in the lobby (which had a foul odor) and ask for a table for 5. It's only 5:30 on a Thurs shouldn't be a problem. Well someone will be right with you says the surly and stoned looking hostess that looked like she rolled out of bed and had to come to work. Waitress took a group of 2 to our intended table. Hostess loudly vents her frustration ""She was supposed to take the 5!!"" Nice communication.  Get to our table and ordered some drinks. Our waitress was cold, unfriendly and about 16 years old. My colleague asks about an off menu item she normally orders back east. Waitress repeatedly argues she's never heard of such a thing and you can order these three giant things instead to make up that smaller dish. Ummmm if you still serve the parts why not make up the mixed basket? We put in our orders, a mixture of appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  I head to the restroom and finally discover why the whole restaurant has a funk of dirty restroom smell. There's puke on the floor outside the women's room. Classy. Appetite lost.  Return and find my colleague had asked the manager about the off menu dish. Manager admits she didn't know it and neither did the line cooks but if one did on another day they'd gladly make it, but they don't know what it is. Ok well that was a more appropriate answer, waitress hope you took notes! After an unusually long amount of time the food shows up. All of it. At once. The appetizer that should have come long before my colleague's main dish. Colleague's main dish totally screwed up (she requested no chicken, whole chicken breast on top), other colleague's not-off menu replacement appetizer, and third colleague's dessert. Colleague #1 sent back the appetizer since she couldn't actually eat it with her main dish already there. Colleague #2 had to wait until all of this was gone to order dessert. Colleague #3 finished his dessert. All very odd timing. Why did our waitress not ask about timing of the courses?  Do you want the appetizer with the meal or before? Is a standard question.  If I wasn't enjoying myself hanging out with the colleagues I see once a year in person I would have run away from the stink of this restaurant. Seriously the lobby of your establishment shouldn't smell of sewer. There should not be puke on the floor. Happy hour is longer than the other establishments at the mall but now I know why! No adult with standards would actually want to eat there!! Save your money. Go to the food court upstairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440
Michael M.,"Renton, WA",102,13,1,2.0,3/24/2011,"A group of co-workers and I met at BJ's in Southcenter last night for drinks and appetizers to celebrate a birthday.  We were able to reserve a corner booth in advance, which was a good thing, as people filtered in and out throughout the evening.   Our waiter was very attentive, making sure everyone in the group had their food and/or beverage choice delivered promptly.  He also made sure to keep everyone's bill separate, which was a good move on his part.    The only blemish to the evening was near the end, when there were about four of us remaining.  We all received our closing bills, then the manager approached us, stating that she was ""covering about $30 worth of food on our bill"".  This led us to believe that some of our co-workers had pulled a dine-n-dash move, and we offered to pay the difference, splitting it between us.   She then went on to explain that it wasn't out fault - it was due to a ""computer error"".  Apparently not everything ordered made it it to their system, and didn't end up being charged appropriately to each person's bill.   If it wasn't our fault, why bring it up?  We all felt like idiots, initially blaming our co-workers for being the ones who ate and ran.  If it's an ""in-house issue"", why should it be a concern to your customers?   If anything, this lets us know that they have a flawed system, and your chances of getting some meals/drinks for free are pretty good if you show up with a large group!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440

I had never heard of this restaurant until I came to shop at the newly remodeled Southcenter. At first I wasn't very impressed, it seemed like just another Cheesecake Factory with a huge menu and fufu drinks (or maybe Cheesecake copied them IDK). My waiter/waitress has been friendly every time I have come in so I wasn't totally turned off by the place.  But after giving it 2 more chances I could see why people liked this place. It was like the adult version of those huge chain restaurants. They had their own brew of beer, which I found to be a plus. And I also noticed one really great thing, NO KIDS!! Yes it was a restaurant just filled with adults.  I didn't have to worry that talking to my friends was going to be interrupted by a screaming bratty 2 year old. Don't get me wrong I appreciate the family dining experience, but sometimes it's just nice to have adult time. And it's not that it isn't family friendly, just that I think a lot of families will pick other places to go. I HOPE! ;) Also they have a really great lunch deal and you can get a good lunch for under $10. Their happy hour seems to be pretty good too.

Jo A.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,5,2,5.0,5/10/2012,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse 'had me at hello.'  Here's the story, my husband and I, tired from shopping at Southcenter Mall, decided to try BJ's before driving home.  We entered the crowded restaurant, and were seated almost immediately.  The hostess took us to a large booth (the only one available) and we sat down. She said our server, Michael, would be with us shortly and left us alone.  Ten minutes passed, and no one came by.  We looked at the menu, talked about what we would order, and waited another five minutes.  Finally, Michael came over and asked us how long had we been waiting?   I said, ""About twenty minutes. (I tacked on five minutes for 'wait trauma').  He apologized profusely and said that they would do something about that.   I said no problem, it wasn't a big deal.  But he said it is a big deal and we'll do something about it. Michael couldn't have been nicer as he explained the menu.  We decided on the Avocado Egg Rolls and Housemade Italian Mini Meatballs for appetizers. For dinner, we ordered the barbequed pulled pork. I went to the restroom, and when I returned our appetizers were there.  They were delicious!  The wontons were crispy, and the blend of avocado, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle pepper and spices in the wrap couldn't have been better.  Next, I sampled the mini meatballs tossed in Marsala marinara sauce and it too, was delicious.  While we were waiting for our dinner, a man came over and said he heard that we had a long wait time; he was sorry for that and wanted to make it up to us by comping our appetizers.  I immediately calculated that would be around $15.00 taken off our bill.  We thanked the man (the manager?) and when he left, I said I thought that kind of service had gone the way of the Dodo bird. Our pulled pork sandwich came and I was not disappointed in that either: Their special sauce was tasty as well as their signature coleslaw. After we had eaten, Michael asked if we ""saved room"" for dessert. Yes, we had---we had 'saved' the price of two appetizers.  We ordered one Apple Berry Burst Crumble that was touted as being a delicious blend of apples and berries with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. When the Apple berry Burst Crumble arrived, Michael set it down, asked us if we wanted anything else and thanked us for coming.  We told him how much we enjoyed our food and he gave us the bill and left. The dessert was---how many times can I write delicious?---well, whose counting?  It was delicious. When we go up to leave we knew that we would return and it wouldn't be just when we were shopping in the mall;  BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse would be a destination all by itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=440

So all our empty glasses sat on the table with us the whole meal. By the time we left, there were 5 empty glasses on the table...

My husband got a pizza, I got a french dip, one of our dinner partners got a salad, and the other dinner partner got nachos. OK, let's size this up: salad is quick and easy, nachos are quick and easy, french dip is quick and easy, and pizza takes a while. Considering that the pizza should have been the hold-up, my husband's pizza was dry and less than fresh. The bread on my french dip was sweet, which galled me every time I took a bite of what should be an entirely savory sandwich. They left off the cheese ... of everything. Not only did my swiss and roast beef french dip have no swiss, the nachos were almost devoid of cheese. Again, nachos devoid of cheese. No beans, no meat, no cheese. Just salsa, sour cream, and olives. The salad got a good review, however. Good for them. They stuck some meat on some lettuce and didn't screw it up. Sure, we could have sent stuff back, but that would have tacked on another hour.

Jason D.,"San Jose, CA",0,113,1,1.0,5/6/2011,"Allegedly we're dealing with a sportsbar that takes beer quality a little more seriously than most chain macro-sportsbars. OK, this could work. Besides their own brews, really nice list of Belgian beers in the bottle. So there's a game 7 of an NHL playoff series in progress, and it's not being shown. Some of the TV's are showing -- get this -- an NFL draft preview show, all stuido guys talking, with of course no sound. Ask waitstaff and barstaff, and none of them have heard of the Bruins or Canadiens (seriously?). It's a sportsbar? They say, ""uh, we'll put it on if we find it."" Yep, sure. Waiter keeps not bringing things -- 3 trips for him to remember a water. And then, the best. One of these carefully-selected Belgian beers, served way too cold (the brewer's instructions on the bottle said 8-12C, and it was about 5 or 6) and with no glass. Now, honestly, drinking an icy cold beer from a bottle is what I'd expect from a sportsbar, but why'd you tease me with this BS about being beer connoisseurs and having this great list?

Also surprising that they have a small plates and bites section on the menu with most item under $5 if you're not that hungry or just don't want to spend much $$$. I ordered the BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger which was pretty good. I also ordered the thick cut fries (jojo's) that came with it instead of the shoestring ones and they were good as well.

The same dining music piped in. Nice high flow hot water.  Paper towels were more like paper, than towels.  My companion said I was being a Snotty Sally about my pickyness on the paper towels. So I had the Tomato soup and grilled ham 'n cheese.  Interesting presentation cuz they cut up the sandwich into equal sized sticks.  I thought it was just for presentation, but after the meal I realized it made perfect sense for dipping!

The breading on it was perfect and it had just the right crisp to it.  Quesadillas - Meh.... they were just okay to me. A little on the salty side.  Angel hair toscana - This wasn't good at all. It had no flavor and was absolutely dry. I had to ask for a side of alfredo to toss over it.  Texas style chicken fried steak - Reading the description of this on the menu made it sound absolutely DELICIOUS... but WRONG! It definitely was not.

Wendy B.,"Marysville, WA",1,4,,2.0,9/22/2013,"We ate here last night, and it was pretty disappointing. First of all we were seated outside, which would normally be fine, except 1) it is literally right next to the parking lot and besides the cars who like to bump their tunes loud enough to make the table vibrate, there is some kind of disturbing sewer type smell that wafts in every once in a while which is not very appetizing, and 2) we were seated right next to a huge table of about 15 screaming junior high school girls whose parents were (smartly) seated at another huge table next to them (but not quite as close as we were).  We couldn't hear each other unless we were yelling over all the noise.  You may think I'm just talking about the noise you expect when you go into a Red Robin, but, believe me, this was Red Robin times 20. Our waitress, unfortunately, was also their waitress, and was much more occupied with keeping up with all of them than getting our drinks and food and checking on us.  We ordered our drinks right away, but did not get them for about 20 minutes.  We had gotten water and dinner salads before our drinks ever arrived.  The waitress did tell us a couple of times that she was just waiting on the bar, and they were backed up, but seriously!!  Once we finally got the drinks, she never checked on us to see if we wanted refills, but honestly we had decided not to get them anyway cause we couldn't take another half hour of screaming teenagers. The food was so-so.  I liked the flavor of my Tuscan Chicken Limone, but when it arrived, the grease pool swimming in the cream sauce was a bit disturbing.  My husband got the Jambalaya, and said it was just alright as well.  Our waitress did check with us once to see if our food was okay, but managed to do this as she was serving and clearing the other table, and was clearly just looking for the nod and nothing else.  Did she not notice the bone dry beer glass that had been sitting on the table for at least 15 minutes? We did have somewhere to be, but could not get our waitress or find her for at least 20 minutes (and our credit card was sitting at the end of the table as a bit of a clue), so had to flag down another server.  She took our card and said ""no worries,"" but then our waitress magically showed up about 5 minutes later with our bill.  We had to tell her that we'd given the card to another server, so then she had to go find it.  Finally the manager (I think) came over with our bill and card, and apologized about the service.  I talked to her a bit, and was nice, but let her know what happened.  Gee it was nice she came over to apologize for something she didn't do, but when she handed us the bill, it was still FULL price.  She didn't even comp us a drink or a freaking side salad. I am not unsympathetic to the waitress having to handle such a huge table, but honestly they should have gotten someone else to handle the smaller tables.  I'm pretty sure we won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=460

At that time, according to them they did not take reservations for my group. I really enjoyed their food their last time before, and know that the place was big enough to hold a large group, so I chose it again. Thus, my group of around 12 people had to wait...in the seating area for about half an hour to get a table. Which sucks, because I guess now they do take reservations!?  Anyway, food was tasty, everyone had a great time. My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow. Although they did accommodate everyone appropriately, we were there for a few hours...(too long, in my opinion).  My most recent visit was not too long ago, with another large group gathering. This time, service was extremely slow again...two waiters had to cater our table, and getting our food felt forever. Yet, another couple hours at the restaurant. The great thing though, is the refillable root beer! We surely all tried to drink as many, and the servers were at least kind enough to always refill our drinks when asked. My tip, is to try avoiding busy hours (esp. dinner time, later in night) when waiting time can take long. Large groups are great here, but be prepared to be staying a least a minimum of a couple hours there. Service can sometimes be slow..(why I gave 4/5 stars) but its usually worth the wait.

I like to believe when the restaurant slows down on a busy night the service should speed up.  NOT this time! Were there for ALMOST two hours. We had four people at our table. First greeting was timely, drink order taking, timely as well, but then we wait at least an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen!  That's crazy! On top of that slowness (granted one item was a well done steak, so that takes a while) three of the four dishes were cold, the one that wasn't cold was the steak, likely because it took the longest to prepare so the other three sat under an inadequate heat lamp. Another issue, two of the four orders were incorrect, one of those a misunderstanding (mine) and another completely wrong.

MrMrs G.,"Milton, WA",0,19,3,2.0,8/2/2015,"We went here tonight for dinner.  We did call ahead seating about 30 minutes prior to arriving and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving, so that wasn't bad.  When we walked into the restaurant we noticed a lot of empty tables, even though they were telling people it was going to be a one-hour wait.  And we also noticed that almost every table we walked by was waiting for food, hardly anybody had food on their table, never a good sign I guess.  We waited a long time to place our order and then a very long time to get our food (not easy when you are dining with two young kids).  Finally our food arrived, but we soon realized that some of it was no good.  My daughter's corn dog bites were raw cornbread inside (how can you mess up deef-fried mini corn dogs?!).  My husband's quinoa and chicken dish was bland and boring.  My sister's hamburger was dry.  We complained to our waiter about the undercooked corn dog bites, and he clearly didn't care, but he did go get the manager.  The manager was a man of few words and just said sorry, do you want more?  We said no, that we couldn't wait any longer because our kids were already losing it from having to wait so long for the food in the first place.  He didn't offer anything else, so we told him we wanted the kid's meal removed from our bill.  He agreed and then disappeared and never came back.  We had to flag down our waiter to finally get our bill (which had had the kid's meal removed, thank goodness), and he asked us several times if we wanted dessert because he clearly wasn't listening the first time we said no (because all we really wanted was dinner that was cooked and tasted good).  We won't be going back to a BJ's again because we've had similar issues with the one in Tacoma as well.  It's too pricey of a restaurant to not have better service and more consistent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=480

A tad ridiculous. it took an hour for our entrees to come out. Let alone the server forgot to take an order for one of the members in our party, but yet his order managed to come out first. The server and manager apologized an hour after our food wasnt on the table besides a few appetizers (fortunately, we ordered those). they said that they were expediting our food order ahead of everyone else, but yet there was another party of 8 that still managed to get their entrees before us and they were seated substantially later. They said free desserts on the house but that took at least another 30 minutes and once again people who ordered after us received their dessert before us. A person ordered a ""classic baked potato and salad"" but they gave him a classic cheeseburger. We had to repeatly ask for condiments like Ketchup/sriracha. The bills were divided incorrectly and she had to double check on drink orders. It seemed that the whole restaurant was dysfunctional from the server, kitchen, and management.

Kiki M.,"Seattle, WA",145,449,6,3.0,7/15/2009,"Okay, so this is a chain restaurant and the name makes me giggle every time I utter it but the food is palatable and the signature beer they serve is quite tasty. BJ's is this enormous building attached to Southcenter mall. Despite its mass which could be filled with corny decorations, it is simple. There is a bar that has happy hour from 3:00 to 7:00 every day and a late night happy hour Sunday through Thursdays. Happy hour specials include $1 off all draft beer, $2 off appetizers, and half off mini pizzas.  I've been to BJ's a few times now and I attempt to try something new each visit. That isn't a hard goal to achieve because the menu is the size of the Bible. Food choices range from pizza (all deep dish), salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pasta. There is even a separate drink menu as thick as the one for food. Plenty of mixed drinks, BJ's speciality brewed beer and favorites like Bud Light and Stella.  The beers are excellent. I've had a sampler and was impressed with each selection. My favorite was their version of an Irish Red. It was smooth and bit you at the end with the hops and I must not fail to mention it had a higher than normal alcohol content.  Foodwise I have only been disappointed once. I ordered a calzone and while the crust was delicious the inside which consisted of vegetables was lacking. There was more dough than vegetables. Another time I had a pasta with tomatoes, garlic, and basil which was good considering the source. My most favorite dish I've had at BJ's is the avocado egg rolls. Avocados are wrapped in egg rolls paper and deep fried. Oh my god. I haven't met anything deep fried I didn't like and this is no exception. A sweet dipping sauce accompanies the egg rolls which heightens the flavor. Excuse me while I clean up the drool from my keyboard. Just thinking about those damn things makes my mouth water. All you food snobs need to check yourselves before you wreck yourselves and try BJ's. We all get cravings for huge obscene chain restaurants.

I hate how far away this location is. But whenever I am at South Center, or going mini golfing at Family Fun Center, we like to stop in here for lunch or dinner. I used to eat at BJ's in Fresno, CA and I always found it mediocre. I tried the pizza, and the baked potato, and burgers. They were all good, but nothing really impressed me enough to order it again.  When I came to this location for the first time though I ordered the french dip sandwich with the shoestring fries. It was love at first bite. The french dip was amazing. Obviously not the best I have ever had, but good enough that I like to order it whenever I come here. And the shoestring fries were AMAZING. They are some of my favorite fries anywhere.  The real reason to come here though. The Pizookie. Oh, you don't know what a Pizookie is? You better go to BJ's to find out.... NOW! Hurry up, go. I'll wait.  Did you have it? Wasn't it amazing? I love a fresh, warm, gooey cookie covered in ice cream. My favorite is the Ghiradelli. With chocolate cookie with chocolate chips, covered in chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and a Ghiradelli chocolate on top. Yum!  They have a good beer selection to, a mix of their own brews, and popular beers like Blue Moon or Manny's. They have a lot of rotating handles too, which is nice.  This place can get busy on weekend nights, obviously. Either don't go friday or saturday night, or be prepared to wait.  Also, don't go hoping to watch the Sounders game, because they are very anti-supporting local teams. They have 10 tvs, and like 3 of them were showing one NCAA football game, but that wasn't enough so they changed the 1 tv showing the Sounders game to more NCAA football. Lovely. I know this is a chain, but you still need to be supporting local teams, especially when you have so many tv's showing the same sports game already. Plus, management told us ""oh, we didn't think anyone was watching the game"" Even though we were never asked if we were, and it was obvious that we were because why else would we be sitting in our booth at an odd angle to watch a tv that is outside and open the blinds on the window? lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=480

They have their own micro beers that are $3 from like noon till 7pm with a seasonal and a rotating tap. They also have all sorts of other beers but I really like the Piranha that BJ's makes. It's an amber but it's a little hoppy like an IPA. Also during March Madness, or I guess anytime, they have 6 giant TV screens in the bar for all the sports watching you can handle. Anyways, they have a killer lunch menu. What I get 80% of the time is the half sandwich and soup/salad combo. Comes with soup/salad first then a pretty good size sandwich and with a bunch of fries for $8. Prettaaaa, Prettaaa, Pretty good deal.

Our table and chairs had water spilled all over them, so they had to wipe it down for us. Our waitress was not reall ""on the ball"" and seemed to forget a lot of stuff. We both ordered small pizzas. I had the Sweet Pig (Hawaiian) and it tasted like it was missing some essential spices. Just kinda blah. And the ham was like luncheon meat. And there wasn't a lot of cheese.

We settled on the mini size of the buffalo chicken pizza (no onions) with a side Caesar salad. I also had one of their homebrewed cream sodas. I love Caesar salads, and this is one of the best tasting dressings I've had from a restaurant in a long time -- it's not ""authentic,"" but it's damn tasty. The croutons are perfectly seasoned for my taste. The pizza itself reminded me of a ""personal pan pizza"" from Pizza Hut -- a favorite of mine -- the same greasy fluffy crusty delight, but topped with some of my favorite things ever: buffalo chicken with celery and ranch [I prefer blue cheese but my little cousin wanted ranch and the default is ranch, so I went with it.

Jordan S.,"Seattle, WA",19,123,27,1.0,5/8/2011,"I hate doing this, but I must. They've pissed me off and are 0 for 2 now. So, here we go... Basically; service sucks hard, food sucks hard, and prices suck the hardest of all. First time I was here I start off with a BJ's porter. When it got to me about fifteen minutes later, it tasted flat. Like it was getting down to the end of the keg or something I dunno, but it was gross. I replaced my beer another fifteen minutes later with one that seemed just fine. After ordering food, blackened salmon for me, I decided to order another drink just in case it was going to take forever again. It did. I got it just as I finished my first. So now the food comes and I'm given a piece of fish thats seriously no bigger than the coaster my beer was on. Very disappointed in the reflection of the price in the meal. Second time we go its to watch the Canucks play. Theres basketball on every TV except one and I ask if we can sit in that section since its almost empty. The girl says no. Who the hell says no to a customer??? I should have walked out then. So we sit down and I, after about ten minutes, get one of the million TVs playing BB changed to hockey. The plan was to chill and just snack on appetizers as we watch the game. But as I found out that was quickly out the window. The appetizers are all damn near the price of the entrees! So we decide to get meals instead. I got a small calzone, and I shoulda just brought a hot pocket for them to microwave for me. Generic, small, and with no sides. It was a glorified $10 hot pocket.  Two friends got a pizza and it came out with NO TOPPINGS! Then the server just says oops and brings out a plate full of pepperoni and crap. I'm thinking, ""Yeah cause thats how you make a pizza normally"". I woulda sent it back but they just dealt with it. Your time is much better spent at Joey's across the way.

Who's BJ anyway?  Decided to meet here with some friends for the playoff game a couple of weeks ago and was impressed with the upscale look of the interior and the huge screen above the bar. Huge! It is a new place after all, and it doesn't scrimp on electronics.  They make their own beer which is cheaper than any of their other tap beers and it's pretty good...at least the red that I had. Strong too...7% I think. They also have a very large selection of Belgian ales and other beers on tap that really surprised me! Had no idea this place offered such a beer selection.  As another reviewer mentioned, the menu IS like a bible. Long, with a lot of choices. I had a hamburger on sourdough. Not too impressed with the burger. Kind of bleh, but okay. We had some potato skins too, which weren't great and not very hot. We sat at the bar and service from the Bartender was pretty good. Especially since it was a playoff game day and he certainly didn't leave me lacking for beer!  I'm giving it 4 stars for the upscale sports bar interior, the extensive beer selection, and pretty good service. I AM a fan.  Not sure about the food yet.

I've tried a few other menu items, but everything else I tried was very mediocre, so everytime I come back I just get one of the pizzas because they are consistently good.  I want to try more of their menu, but I'm always tempted to order pizza because of my bad experience with the other food there. The service here is decent, it's not extraordinary but I don't really have any complaints either.  One thing that is absolutely amazing is their dessert though... the pizookie is a fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top and it seriously is the best dessert I've ever had... there are times I come here just because I crave the pizookie so much!  And if you watch a movie at AMC Southcenter on the same day, save your ticket stub and show it to your waiter and you can get a free pizookie with your meal!

John J.,"Bellevue, WA",43,47,,1.0,3/24/2013,"Went here for my son's birthday.  It's been his favorite place to go for his birthday for years.  Tonight: How disappointing. The place was fairly busy as we arrived, though that busyness tapered off after about an hour.  The booth where we sat was our customary booth - things were really looking good for us as we settled in, ordered our apps and drinks, and watched some March Madness coverage. Things began to fall apart when the appetizers arrived and we realized that no appetizer plates had been brought out.  We asked for them, and the young gent bounced off as if eager to get them for us.  We gnoshed on our teasers for about 5 minutes before we noticed he'd not returned.  Irony:  As my son finished the last potato skin, our server showed up with 5 plates... which she absent-mindedly set next to the three empty appetizer plates - unable to recognize that they were no longer needed. Order taken, we sat and watched our games a bit longer.  The server returned and placed my side salad directly in front of me.  Asked if I needed anything else, and sauntered off before I could point out that I had no silverware.  Raised index fingers and excuse mes didn't stop the next 5 servers who passed by.  One of them eventually stopped, looked at my table, then kept on going as if unable to recognize that a) I really needed help, and b) that something was missing.  Another stood in the server station watching me as I looked to my plate full or Caesar Salad and began picking at it with my bare fingers.  He, like the others, disappeared without fixing the problem.  Eventually, our flight attendant/server returned and asked if all was well... as if my still full plate of salad wasn't indication enough... and I asked politely for a roll of silverware.  She said, ""Sure thing!""  And poofed again.  10 minutes passed.  A short Hispanic woman walked by with a tray full of silverware and started loading up the empty tables with fresh settings.  I had to go and try, through her broken English, to explain that I needed 5 settings worth.  Just as I got the rolls I required and returned to my table, the server appeared with 5 more rolls of silverware and a comment, ""Oh?  Decided not to eat it with your fingers?  Glad you got that sorted out."" And took off again. As I predicted, the food arrived moments after my first hunger-driven bite of now wilted and soggy salad.  Drink refills were slow to follow.  We ended up staying nearly 2 hours to finish our meal and get out.  Note:  Our formerly absent server was anxious to bring our check, make sure we paid our bill quickly, and attentive to ensure we cleared out quickly so she could get the table ready for someone new. Side notes:   - The manager was standing in the station next to our table as we complained about the service.  He heard me, looked up, frowned, and then stalked off.  No apology.  No attempt to make it right.  And nothing taken off the check. - We mentioned my son's birthday to the server.  No mention was made of his special occasion the rest of the meal.  When presented with our check, we were offered the ""upsell"" on dessert, but not the complimentary birthday comp that usually is a no-brainer at BJ's.  My son was actually angry that she'd forgotten - asked me not to make a big deal about it though. - The bathrooms were filthy.  Clearly they had not been attended to in hours. - As I walked out, I took note of the light fixtures.  All of them had caked on dust bunnies on the tops... especially on the cables hanging them from the ceilings.  This had me questioning the cleanliness of the entire restaurant. We've decided we won't be returning to the Tukwila restaurant any time soon.  We may try one of their other locations, because we like the food and the hand-crafted root beer.  But for now, Tukwila is a no-go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=500

Five minutes later I received my sauce and as I was mixing it in and realized I had about two pieces of spinach--despite the menu stating it was on a ""bed of spinach"". My fiancé was completely done with his meal, I hadn't even started! I finally track downy waitress and ask for a manager. The manager finally came over, I told her my pasta plight, and without an apology asked of she wanted them to remake it. I laughed. I told her no, and she said ""we'd really like it if you stayed"". Sorry, no, we paid for our appetizer and pizza and went to Chipotle for dinner. The manager and waitress did not care about their service at all, and I definitely won't be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=500

Roger M.,"Spanaway, WA",1,14,,2.0,6/27/2015,Went today for dinner. Our waiter Jonathon took our drink order and brought them quickly.  He took our order right away.  Then it started to go down hill.  It took a long time for our order to come out.   After we got our food our waiter came over after several minutes and asked if everything tasted ok.  Then he disappeared   I did notice he enjoyed standing by the bar just talking to other employees.  He did walk by our table three times but did not stop.  I needed more tea and my son wanted another soda.  After we were done. We had to find him to get our check.  When he brought the credit card receipt back for signature. This pen did not work. So I said well the waiter doesn't work it is only fitting his pen doesn't either. So. He did not get a tip nor signature.  This was sad because we eat at the South Hill location 2 or 3 times a month and get great service.  This location gets two stars only because the food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=500

It has no specialty it has no distinct ambience, it's just a generic restaurant with generic food that everyone can enjoy. I went with a couple friends who eat there often.  If you're invited by friends or have a picky eater who only likes restaurants like these, it's a nice place to go, but if you're looking for somewhere fun and inventive I would try anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
Rey M.,"Seattle, WA",6,64,,4.0,2/7/2009,"A month back me and my wife came down to BJs. We had a great time. I couldn't stop talking about how good the pizza was.The following 3 weeks I've been pestering my wife to come back to BJs for a second go. I fell in love with there Chicago style deep crust pizza. Since my initial visit I started seeing all these shows on the tube in regards to Chicago dining and guess what, its always talking about there pizzas. Well we finally made it back this evening. This time with the kids.  BJs is a great establishment, plenty of seating and a huge bar. Did I mention that it has this huge TV showcasing 6 different sporting events in one screen. All the TV's in the restaurant can be seen from any booth or table through out. Its nice to be able to come here with your family and still able to catch glimpse of different sporting events. Not having it being limited to only the bar.  The menu had plenty to choose from. As far as appetizers go, there was nothing that I haven't seen before. Your typical artichoke dip, buffalo wings, some variety of an egg roll.... But what was different is that they had a bake potato section. Believe me, some of the sizes of these potatoes coming out of the kitchen were huge. You cant help but notice it when a waiter passes by your table ready to serve one. We finally ordered one on our second go. Delicious.  We have yet to try anything else from the menu besides the pizza and different appetizers but rest assure, the pizza alone warrants a visit. Around my area this is the only place that serves Chicago Style pizza that I can think of. I know of a few near downtown. Also they have a great selection of drinks here. They brew there own beer and have 7 to choose from. Lastly let me mention there Pizookie. Its short for Pizza Cookie. As they do it in Chicago, its a cookie baked in a small pan then served fresh out of the oven hot with a nice serving of ice cream to top it off. Oh its sooooo good! Make sure you save room for dessert.  Overall this is a nice place to either take a group of friends, family or your significant other and enjoy a wonderful meal. The price is not that bad. For a dinner with us and our 2 kids, we spent just a little above 50$. And that's with drinks. The menu has plenty to choose from. The wait is never long. The staff was great and service was very prompt. The drinks that they brew here directly is nice. Let me leave my review and just say: Order the Pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
Betty D.,"Dublin, CA",177,246,395,4.0,12/4/2008,"They have a whole variety of stuff for under $6 if you order off the lunch menu perfect for one person. My boss shut down our office...yes just for me...and took us here for my going away party. We had about 20 people and were in and out in about less than two hours. Service was up to par for a big party. It was pretty busy too since it was lunch time. Always had good service here. To start off: Chicken wings. Pretty tasty. Santa Fe Spring Rolls and their crispy thin pizza appetizer is pretty good. I like the fresh basil with Italian sausage. Prefect size for lunch!  Clam chowder was rich and creamy and delicious!  For an entree try the PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN served with mashed potatoes.  GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA with rotelle noodles with their rich cream sauce and steamed brocolli. I usually ask for a side of their sauce because they don't put a lot on the pasta and i like my pasta's creamy...even though my stomach will argue with me. And for dessert you have to try the TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PIZOOKIE® FEATURING GHIRARDELLI! It is to die for and melts in your mouth. I'm not a sweets person but this is totally delish. Gauranteed or your money back!!...well, from me. hahaha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
Meredith M.,"Minneapolis, MN",79,36,2,4.0,2/28/2010,"This is based on delivery, I ordered through South King County Restaurant Delivery Guide - 2GoServices. I was reading through the 2GoServices restaurants available for delivery to my hotel and then also comparing those restaurants to Yelp reviews (thanks Yelp!) I settled on BJ's, (teehee), because they had the most selection that I could trust having never been there before. Well, the delivery was great...the packaging kept my cold food cold and hot food hot. My house salad was crunchy and had a nice roll with it, too.  I also had the rotini pasta w/sauce and it was cheesy and zesty with nicely grilled chicken and crunchy, bright green steamed broccoli, very yummy! The delivery person was great, but I think he was from the 2GOServices, but came right up to my hotel room door.

Carollynn Z.,"Poulsbo, WA",17,8,6,1.0,4/13/2012,"I would give it a 0.5 if I could but the lowest available is 1. This is the second worst restaurant experience I have ever had; a close second to my worst restaurant experience where the waiter was on drugs and the chef was drunk. At least the food was good at BJ's when it finally got to use 1 1/2 hours later and the waiter was nice just totally overwhelmed. We were with a large group and had a reservation. The restaurant knew that our party would have 40 to 50 people. We had one waiter with a little bit of extra help. It took about 90 minutes to get our food, and another 90 minutes before we got our bills. Some people in our party were there for 3 1/2 hours total.  Although the waiter seemed totally inept, I think it was more to do with procedures, training and inefficiencies. The protocols for taking orders and getting our checks seemed very cumbersome and not user friendly to the wait staff. Here are some other things that seemed due to poor training and management issues: 1. There were a lot of waiters around but our large group only had the one waiter and a little help from some other waiters at times. Poor planning for a large group. 2. Waiters were scurrying back and forth from the kitchen/bar with only one or two dishes. They never seemed to carry more than one order at a time. 3. Combine number 2 with the fact that we were in a very long room with only one door at one end, the wait staff had to make a long trek from wherever they had to go to get food and drink to tables at the far end of the room. Those waiters spent 85% of their time walking and 15% of their time actually helping the diners. 4. Several of us at the table did not have utensils or napkins. One of us asked a passing waiter, not our own waiter, to get us all some forks, napkins, etc. The waiter came back with only one set for 7 people. We had to request service for the rest of us and it took another trip to make that happen.  5. We sat for at least 30 minutes before we even got water. And another 30 minutes before we got our drinks.  6. When the checks finally got to us, there were multiple mistakes and an automatic 17% gratuity added in.  The only good thing was that the food was hot and tasty when it got too us. Or maybe we were so hungry by that time we would have eaten anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
Johnnie L.,"Renton, WA",88,60,53,2.0,12/16/2009,Went here for the late night happy hour. The place was pretty nice overall with a large bar. Wasn't that busy but the service was great. The food on the other hand was just ok. Thier late night happy hour menu was very limited to just mini pizzas and $2 off appetizers. Might give it another try for drinks and watching games. They have a huge screens. So I went back another time just to give it another try. The food was not very good. We had tried over 6 different things and nothing stands out.

Philip L.,"Seattle, WA",3,13,2,3.0,8/30/2009,"So one of my buddies was heading off to med school, and a few us got together to have BJ's for the first time......sorry, couldn't resist! When I walked in, it reminded of many other brew houses that I have been to numerous times. Being a fan of hearty American cuisine with ice cold signature beers, I was excited for the meal. After we had all arrived and had a good long solid conversation, the waiter finally decided to ask us for our orders. The ensuing wait for the drinks and food was another long wait. I was rather surprised because this was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was pretty quiet. The waiter then followed up his already subpar performance by mixing up our beers and spilling some on the table. I'm usually a stickler on service so this might be a slight overreaction on my part, but I appreciate a basic level. The food and beer was actually pretty good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza (yes, I felt like splurging for a day) and it really tasted like a bacon cheeseburger on a Chicago-style deep dish pizza. The flavor was outstanding and the amount of food was definitely worth the price. Although my palate felt like an oil slicked road by the end of the meal, I couldn't have really expected otherwise. Overall, the experience wasn't great, but the food was pretty good. I'm not sure if I will go back simply because I appreciate outstanding service, but if you are getting tired of going to your normal brewhouse, it might be worth it to give BJ's a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520

She wasn't one of those ""bitchy"" servers that throw things on your table, or ask you if you need anything when in reality they don't really feel like serving you...or the ones that dont care to smile or make eye contact. This server was wonderful! She always made sure we were taken care of. 5 stars for you Maria!!! EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!!!! As for the food. Bleh. I like their jambalaya...and of course their pazookis you can never go wrong! They just melt in your mouth.

Trisha F.,"Kent, WA",5,12,5,4.0,1/27/2012,My husband and I love coming here. On this lovely night we decided to share a plate of the Texas chicken fried steak :( :( DON'T EVER order this EVER!! Unless you love salt. Maybe it was a bad night for Mr. Chef because he couldn't even pull off steamed veggies without it tasting like pure salt... This made me very sad. Now for the bright side..... Our waitress Madeline was absolutely AMAZING! The cutest little thing with a great personality and very attentive. They took our steak off of bill and gave me a much needed and refreshing salad on the house.

Brandon G.,"Seattle, WA",124,51,,5.0,3/14/2009,"This place gets a 5 star boost from me.  They have a great happy hour - 2 dollars off apps, dollar off drafts and 1/2 off their mini deep dish pizzas.  We went there with a group on a Friday for happy hour and the bar was full.  The manager accommodated us by giving us a table and extended to us the happy hour.  Server was attentive and friendly.  The pizza's were fantastic - deep dish, perfectly crispy on the outside (super greasy though) and quite airy and porous for a deep dish making it not too heavy on the crust side.  Wish they didn't put tomatoes on every pizza though.  Some other good ones include the avocado egg rolls and potstickers.  Avoid the wings.  They have a great selection of 42 beers on tap but I was more impressed by the Belgian bottled selection which is a real gem.

Our bartender Christian was the best and took great care of us the whole night. I had the avocado egg rolls and they were delicious! The second time I went I opted to get the egg rolls again for an appetizer and split a club sandwich with my husband. It was all really good. I also had to try the pear (hard)cider because I had never had it before. It was really good but REALLY sweet, nice for one glass but I prefer to drink something a little less sweet if I'm going to have more than one.  I will probably be back soon. I think next time I will choose to go later at night and just sit at the bar. When we were seated out in the restaurant it was really busy and took a while for our server to get back to us. It was clear that he was really busy and he always made a point to let us know he would be available shortly. So if you go on a weekend during the day expect a crowd. Good service Good fun!

Probably the best tasting root beer next to sarsasparilla that I've had! Appetizers are tasty. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with my dish: the California burger. It was more like a sandwich and gave me a headache. Also, a warning...their deep dish pizza is not authentic deep dish...it's a bumpy fat crust baked in a deep dish pan.

Rob B.,"Redmond, WA",339,125,,2.0,7/31/2008,"Alright, so I was there during their week of training. Take that with a grain of salt... First off, the appetizers need work. The Santa-Fe Spring Rolls? AWESOME! The rest? ... meh. MEH I SAY! Now, they brew a bunch of beer, which is awesome and worth a star. They are all pretty tasty, and I don't even like beer. Plus, they have a million beers on tap.  We got some entrees that needed some work. A table-mate of ours got the BBQ sandwich. The fries that they served with it were these weird shriveled things that needed some work. The sandwich itself was too sweet and had that flavor of bottled BBQ. Sad! Another tablemate got one of their famous pizzas. They are all 'deep dish', which just means thick crust to these people. The sauce had a canned flavor, the chicken wasn't bad, but the dough itself, while made in-house it seemed, was super young with virtually no flavor. All and all, the pizza disappointed the hell out of me. The red onions weren't even cooked... My entree was a cobb salad. The best part of the salad was the actual bacon they put on it. The lettuce was a super small cut, hard to eat. Too much dressing (also tasted bought from a bottle), the avocado was turning colors, and the turkey was deli style force-formed. No egg, no 'non-traditional' additions like mushrooms or tomatoes or greenbeans. This was the most boring cobb-salad I have ever had. I don't even think it had blue cheese on it. In short, a star for their surprisingly delicious beer. Everything else blew chunks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
Michael B.,"Seattle, WA",26,75,9,4.0,9/18/2008,"Yea, its corporate.  Yea, its typical american fare.  Yea, its new.  Mind you I haven't been there on a busy night, when everything is crankin and mistakes are sure to be made, but I have been there twice, and both experiences have been really good.  Belly up to the bar with Far(r)en, who in a nonchelant way, will hook you up with some good brews, and honest news about the food.  Decor is nice, kinda typical upscale sportsbar.  Clean (really new place), big TV's with sports channels at all times (maybe put on Animal Planet for the kids sometime???)  and large comfy looking tables.    The beer is good!  Not GREAT, but good.  Favorites so far have been the stout and the red.  Its imperial stout, so not real bitter, but a good blend of coffee, chocolate, malt and a little more malt, with a smooth, creamy finish.  The red is nice, with a good balance of hops, wheat and malt, slightly sweet and clean finish. The other reason I like those two....over 8% alky content.  YEAAA BOYEEE!!  Most of thier beers finish clean, and have a similar quality, in that they are not lingering.  Good with food, but I'm not sure if I would choose their beer to just drink on its own.  But, for $3 a pint, I'll quaff one with lunch any day.   So far, I have only had lunch, which is a KILLER deal on weekdays.  Half sandwich (many choices), salad or BOWL of soup (3 choices), AND fries!!  How much would you pay for this amazing combo??  $12.95??  $9.95??  How about $6.95 my friends?!?  And how about $5.95 for a mini deep dish pizza with one topping AND a salad?!?!  MAMMA MIA!!   There are lots of other lunch specials too, ranging from six bucks up.   I had the california club sandwich, seved on fluffly, garlic bread style sourdough, lightly grilled, and stuffed with a grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and some fancy sauce that eludes my memory.  I chose the skinny fries (warm, not hot) and a BOWL of the chili.  The sandwich was delish, the chili was very tasty with a nice level of spice (2*) and the fries were decent, but much better if they were piping hot.  But they probly were sitting in a bowl under a heat lamp for a while.  Sorry guys, I know the industry far to well.   The pizza was surprisingly good.  I'm a traditional, NY style pizza guy, and I really haven't found that crust that WOW's me in Seattle.  This deep dish crust was light and buttery, with a little cheese caramelized around the edges.  I had the BBQ chicken style for an extra charge, with red onions, roasted tomatoes, grilled chicken bits, BBQ sauce and fresh cilantro (LOVE IT).  I ate every bit with glee.  Even the wedge salad was good!  A big crisp wedge of iceberg, with blue chz dressing AND crumbles, diced tomatoes, red onion bits and crumbled bacon.  For 6 bucks (plus upcharge for BBQ chicken), cannot complain at all!!  I'd eat the pizza again, which says alot coming from this pizza snob's mouth.   The prices are ok for normal hours.  I'd suggest doing lunch or happy hours to check the place out, and decide for yourself if its worth it coming for dinner.  Me, I'll be there every monday, at the bar for lunch.  See ya there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=520
AJ M.,"Seattle, WA",17,138,125,1.0,10/25/2010,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! DISAPPOINTING. Greeted and seated immediately by friendly hostesses.  Environment:  Loud atmosphere. Difficult to have any kind of conversation.  CLEANLINESS: Fair.  Overall okay, preoccupied tables still stood cluttered and dirty.  QUALITY OF SERVICE and ACCURACY OF ORDER: Extremely slow and poor!  Are hand in hand on this one. You have a better chance of winning the mega-millions lottery then either of these. We were greeted by our waiter ""Shay."" After that the courteous, friendly help and accuracy were gone. We ordered our drinks (Root beer) and some flat bread. He acknowledged the order. Flat bread never showed up. (A later excuse was given he did not hear us order it.) Two children's meals were ordered (a cheese burger and a hamburger). Both medium. We ensured this was heard and acknowledged. Ketchup on the side. (no condiments were on the tables.) Also ordered were the Pot roast and a BBQ Chicken Salad. Both burgers arrived - WELL DONE. The cheese burger - NO Cheese. Shay was flagged down, where he took the burger away and returned sometime later with the same burger and a piece of broken, unmelted cheese on it. The buns were dry and overcooked. Sticky rice - overcooked exterior and beyond al dente dry center. Ketchup requested, yet again. (I think the tomatoes were just being harvested as we did not see it and borrowed it from another occupied table.)  The BBQ Chicken Salad - bring a magnifying glass as it will be quite a chore searching out the small and few chicken pieces.  The pot roast. Well, the bottom of the plate had dried on food particles both seen and felt. The meal consisted of a large center portion of mashed potatoes, surrounded by very few vegetables. (3 of the 7 were very small baby carrots.) The meat and gravy itself was extremely salty.  We actually received another round of root beers as he, Shay, rapidly passed by.  The Blue Cheese dressing tasted as if it was spoiled.  OVERALL SERVICE:  At any time a request was made with Shay, to include our first order, he would walk away while we were still ordering.  With our plates placed at the serving end of our table, making what I thought would be an obvious sign, was not. After he passed by twice I asked for our bill, THREE TIMES, in between would you like dessert, another drink and I don't know what the 3rd mumbled thing said was. I reminded him the ketchup never arrived either and he began stammering some type of excuse and mid-sentence shuffled off toward the kitchen. Another 5 minutes passed when ""Kim"" the On-Duty manager arrived stating Shay had told her something was wrong but he had no idea what it was. I told her we would pay the entire bill and explain everything. She was professional and listened intently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=540

Good that they have some solid guest taps since the sampler set I got of the house brews only had 1 that I would want to drink a pint. As for the food, we tried a few appetizers since it was happy hour and they all really screamed, ""I came off the FSA truck to the freezer to the fryer to you.  I hope you enjoy the mass-produced experience.""  The hot wings in particular were a crime.  My blackened chicken sandwich was exactly as I remembered and that was the highlight of the evening.  But it was more for nostalgia than it being a blow away entree.

Sean B.,"Tacoma, WA",14,62,,4.0,11/12/2008,"My feelings on BJ's are quite mixed. I was initially thrilled the first time I went here - the root beer was amazing! Of course, having just dropped $500 on some amazingly cute new clothes I guess there was no way the day could be perfect. Our super friendly server brings out my personal pizza that I had ordered. Thank god I decided to cut in with a knife and fork. My cheesy, bready goodness was filled with pepperoni. So, I flag down our server who semi-graciously takes it back. Meanwhile my friends take to eating. Maybe it was just the lunch rush but by the time my new pizza was out my friends already had their bills. Needless to say, I was a bit peeved at this point and told them I really didn't want to make my friends sit here and watch me eat, and I'd rather not have it. So a few minutes later the manger comes over, she's super friendly, profusely apologizes and gives me a $20 gift card along with my meal for free. BJ's would have a pretty nasty review from me if not for their amazing customer recovery and what I later discovered was an excellent pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=540
Kelsey F.,"Bothell, WA",95,228,,4.0,9/11/2008,"Dining partner wanted to hit BJ's for dinner in a bad sort of way, and being the good person I am I finally relented.  I mean, hey, that means another yelp review for me, right? BJ's is like Gordon Biersch - part restaurant, part brewpub, part chain.  Where I feel BJ's wins out over Gordon Biersch is the variety of brews - not only do they have seven regular beers (plus a seasonal beer, currently an Oktoberfest brew, as would be the norm for this time of year) but they also have hard cider and some sodas - rootbeer, cream soda, and a cherry soda if I remember correctly.  (I know the first two are right.)  On top of all of that is a massive list of ""outside"" beers they serve...and when I mean massive, I mean massive.  They're out to compete with Tap House, apparently. Our server was a noob, so he was being followed by a second server who was training him.  He seemed a little eager to please and probably came back a few too many times asking how things were going, but both dining partner and I were in sympathetic moods and remember all too clearly what it's like being the ""new person on the staff"", so we let it go. We were stoked to get a big, semi-circle booth - with just two people, you'd expect that to be saved for a larger party, but boy were we excited to be able to sit closer to each other.  You know, to talk.  Sheesh.  ;) Dining partner had the seven beer sampler, which had all but the seasonal brew in 5oz pours.  That's a lotta beer, folks, and we felt this to be more generous than other places, so bonus points to them.  I wanted to try the hard berry cider, so I got a 5oz pour of that plus a cream soda because finding places that make their own cream soda is impossible.  Plus they said that there was hints of butterscotch.  I dare you to turn THAT down. The beers weren't bad - the blonde was definitely awesome.  The cider was really good, nice and tart and refreshing.  (And surprisingly clear.)  The cream soda, though, won for both dining partner and I - holy crap that was some good cream soda.  No weird, artifical flavoring...just good, cool, crisp butterscotch flavored cream soda-ness.   Yum. Dining partner ordered the spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza (small), I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta.  The pizza looked good and dining partner seemed pleased - I would've sampled, but I haven't been able to eat much lately and I was faced with Mt. St. Pasta.  The scampi pasta was angel hair pasta with olive oil, garlic, tomatos, and parmesan cheese.  And surprisingly, a ton of shrimp scampis!  Usually you get, like, five shrimps but there was TONS! Pasta wasn't bad, though I'd like a little more salt, but I'm a salt fiend. Mine also came with two pieces of toasted garlic bread, which was SO good. We did not save room for dessert, but wound up splitting a small bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce on it, which was a good way to end the evening. We never felt rushed, we had a great view of the giant TVs in the bar (the better to watch sports on), and we left with leftovers and happy thoughts.  We WILL be returning to this place.  For more cream soda.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=540

Especially the ones that are somewhat close in, avoiding having to walk a mile or so to your destination.

There's a generous mix of different types of people ranging from the very young to the very old and all those in between. The prices are moderate. The food is actually rather good.

nate j.,"Renton, WA",53,257,66,3.0,1/25/2009,"OK for first time experience but not stellar. Seated in what seemed to be a reasonable wait time (10-15 mins) on a Saturday night.    The place is nicely decorated and low lighting have a nice vibe going on.   The menu is big.  The server even described it as being as big as the bible.  It took a while to read through and decide what we wanted.  I think they offer a wide variety of foods from pizza, to pasta, salads, sandwiches, and loads of appetizers.  Think TGI Fridays, Red Robin, RAM Brewery, etc.  and that'd pretty much be what JB's is sort of like, but no sports memorabilia or other crap plastered to the walls and ceilings. The service was generally OK but the first round of mixed drinks came out staggered one at a time.  One of our party didn't get his drink as they were out of a key ingredient, but it wasn't until our first round was done that they came by to explain why the drink wasn't ready yet.  The beer was absolutely a fine representation of each of the different styles (I had the seven 5oz. sampler) none was too memorable, except the hefeweizen. Appetizers (potato skins and pot stickers) were good but they weren't like the best I'd ever had.  They weren't the worst either.  Like Randy Jackson says ""it's aaahh-iiight, dawg."" The diners at our table had a chicken parm, fish-n-chips, ribs, and a pizza.  I believe all were pleased with their choices and no complaints there. Parking is free and even on a busy Saturday, we were able to find a spot fairly easily.  Best advice is to avoid the urge to hunt for a spot up close and instead wind your way to the upper floors of the parking garage. Bottom line: we might be back, but with so many other new offerings around the new and improved Southcenter, we may be more inclined to keep trying other new places before we return here. As for price, I selected moderate.  Dinner for two, two drinks each, and appetizer plus tax and tip was over $70.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=540

Koko M.,"Seattle, WA",8,2,2,1.0,5/12/2011,"This was the worst dining expeirence ever! Two times in a row. You would think after the first time we would not of come back. But we thought maybe it was just the super young waitress who delayed our order. It took 20 minutes just to get two waters and a Sprite.  The second time we went was when the boss was in town. He took out the whole office. There was 12 of us. Again it took 20 minutes just to get water. And about 30 minutes for the bar drinks. After the first 45 minutes we were able to place our order. The food took so long to get out of the kitchen that the manager brought us unsolicited free appetizers. They were mediocre to say the least. Usually free food at a restaurant is awesome. Right? Not really at BJ's. It was more like damage control on the managers part. Nice try, but no cigar. So the CEO of our company takes us all out to dinner, and he is the one that the waiter can't seem to get the order right on. One of our party members had to personally walk up to one of the staff members and explain that the most important person at the table needs to be taken care of correctly. They still messed up his order. Threes times in total  to try and amend  it. So the icing on the cake is 6 out of the party of 11 got sick from the food. Possibley more, they just haven't spoken up yet. So in summary, the service sucks, the food doesn't taste good and it made us sick. don't go here unless you are going to get drunk at the bar and watch the 10 foot big screen TV.

The bar waitress arrived and we asked about the HH specials to which she informed us that HH did not exist on Saturdays. ""Oh, OK, that's fine. We were told it did..."" we said nonchalantly. She immediately left to get the manager-we weren't even upset, but the next thing made us so. The manager comes out and speaks to us in a very condescending tone, ""Um, so, yeeeaah, there's no HH on Saturdays."" Giving us the old stink eye. IT was like they expected us to freak out and treated us like we had.

But after trying their pizza, I'm in looooooooooooooooove.  Pizzas are delicious. Even all the other foods are BOMB DIGGITY. I've had many of my friends which are pizza haters become pizza lovers at Bj's. Their 6 inch deep dish pizza with the perfect crust beats any other pizza place. i PROMISE! Their pizookie is also very yummy. I'm not a big fan of desert. However, the pizookie is something I have to get. Enough about the food, its time to talk about the service. Although parking is a pain in the butt sometimes, this place has absoultely fantasticly uberiffic service. From the beginning to end, they are trained to be respectful, friendly, and very comforting (especialy the hosts!!!!)

Melissa G.,"Renton, WA",17,31,3,5.0,1/20/2009,"I have got to say, Wow - I love this place.  BJs is the kind of place that has a relaxing but fun environment, delicious food, great beer, good happy hour, and polite-real-great servers. It really is the kind of place to go with friends or family, kick back some beers, and let the good times roll.  The music is usually playing some good tunes, this way its okay to talk a little loud with out the people next to you ease dropping in your conversation- like smaller places.  Some of my favorite dishes are the balsamic chicken (better then Moms home made chicken), the great white pizza (who would have thought Alfredo sauce on pizza would be so good), & any place with a great french dip sandwich is 5 stars in my book.  Most of the BJs beer is very good. I personally loved the Nutty Brewnette and I am not usually a dark beer kind of person. The pumpkin ale was also very yummy and the piranha pale ale.  The service was great as well. The staff seems to be genuine, real, fun, nice, and knowledgeable (of their place of work).

Please do NOT tell me this is deep dish pizza. Do I look stupid? I probably do. But don't assume I am. Although I might be. I think I'm dumb. Maybe just happy (Nirvana). It really isn't bad pizza, but it just had huge crust. And from what I've learned, deep dish is deep because of sauce. I read in another review that it is glorified pizza hut pizza. And that is spot on. But Pizza Hut pizza is good and so is this. But this is NOT CHICAGO STYLE. BJ's is a mediocre chain with some restaurants outperforming others, and also is a chain that has good pizza with big crust, pizza that shouldn't be called deep dish.

Robert L.,"Renton, WA",14,102,3,4.0,1/8/2010,"like the cheesecake factory, it has a bible for a menu, and like the ram it brews it's own awesome beers.  i'm usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but this place is noteworthy. the food is good and it's a casual environment to just kick back and pound some beers. what i LOVE about their encyclopedia sized menu (Volume J to be exact) is that they have beer pairings with their food, so if you're not the most knowledgeable of beers, they can break it down for you :)  my first adventure: my buddy and i split a pizza and wings, it was awesome, the pizzas are deep dish style, and they do it right! light and fluffy on the inside, cripsy on the outside, with minimal grease.  we went in october when their seasonal beer was a pumpkin ale (my fav), so essentially this particular dining experience was a perfect bromance date. adventure the second: a little over a year later the same dude and i go back, and again, we split a pizza (Mediterranean) and this time got nachos, and me being the piggy i am, ordered a bowl of chili too.  you don't even have to ask, of course i got their seasonal beer! Grand Cru (not nearly has mind blowing as pumpkin ale).  what separates this outing from the first is that everything we ordered tasted pretty bland, i mean, it was good, just not great. if i had a few more beers in my system it would have tasted great.  but skip the chili, it tasted as if it was from a can, wasn't even very hot either :( so this time around, it got a 3/5, and doing the proper math, this is how i summed up my overall 4/5 stars you see above (oh yea, i went to kollege)  overall: i will be going back in the future because i likes beer, and i like their ""gourmet"" bar food, i also wanna try some else there besides pizza",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=560

The manager apologized several times and the reason for the delay was , they were out of nachos and were frying a fresh batch. When it arrived finally, it was super delicious. Fish Tacos, with side of warm nachos and delish sauces. And I was happiest when the check was on the table. I was not billed for my entree! That was sure a great gesture.

Denise D.,"Seattle, WA",0,93,,3.0,4/7/2013,"The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because we actually had a really decent waitress. Now let's start at the beginning: gone is the time/era where young people employed and in a working environment actually convey a greeting and manners. This was surely in effect with the hostess located behind the front counter (this is the person who greets people) and this was also in effect for the other hostess (this is the person who takes you to your table) who led us to our table. Hostess number 1, neither observed nor spoke to us being in the restaurant for at least 5 minutes. She was heavily engrossed in her computer system. A quick, hi there how are you and I'll be with you in a few moments would have been really nice. Yeah...that didn't happen. Hostess #2 had zero personality and conveyed this. She led us to the outer area, which was empty but which had a huge ladder in place; it wasn't the most welcome of atmospheres/environment and we didn't care for the area. Actually all of the restaurant was empty since it was open only for a little whilte. We did not like this area and asked if we could be moved inside. She did not care for this request and simply said ok and walked back inside. Wow, if it was just me and not my husband and myself, I would have walked all of the way out. We also observed another couple come in with the same young lady and while you tried to seat them in the same area, they weren't having it either and she was just as friendly with them. First impressions are huge and these 2 young ladies are doing a huge disservice to this restaurant with their personalities or lack of. Enter our waitress, very nice, very helpful. My husband ordered the asian wrap and the house made rootbeer. I ordered the turkey club and a side of avocado with iced tea. The drinks came promptly. The rootbeer was heavy with vanilla and that's a shame because it took away from the flavor of rootbeer. The time for us to receive our meals, considering the emptiness of the restaurant was about 15 to 20 minutes. After almost finishing, our waitress asked if we would like dessert. My husband ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Ok the wait for this 20 minutes plus. This is the 2nd time for us coming into this place. The first time was a long time ago, it wasn't so great but we thought we'd give it a try, to see if maybe it had improved.Well.....ok not much. Food is ok, nothing to say at a later date...hey remember that really good meal we had at BJ's? Nope not happening. The people working here....management, you have some work to do. I say this with some knowledge as both my husband and I are managers and we realize how important it is to have effective, good people working for you.

Lucky for me, the manager handled the situation beautifully . He was attentive and understanding and never once made me feel like my ""issue"" was too little for his attention. Essentially, even in a big busy chain restaurant I felt as though I was treated with individual care, respect, and compassion!

Mike G.,"Kent, WA",1,24,20,2.0,7/3/2010,"We've been to BJ's twice. It's located on the south side of the Southcenter mall. I like the look of the place and the beer is good, but the food is just OK, which is a general consensus from the entire family. I order the pulled pork. Here is the description: ""BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Slow-roasted pork tossed in our smoky BBQ ranch sauce made with BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale and topped with crispy onion strings, all on a grilled bun. Served with our signature coleslaw."" I liked the addition of the crispy onion strings but wasn't impressed by the BBQ sauce. I only had two problems with the sandwich (aside from the BBQ sauce) 1. The pork was chopped (hunks of pork), not pulled (thin shreds of pork) 2. No mention of what appears to be thousand island sauce (AKA: special sauce), which I am in no way a fan of.  If you're going to include a major ingredient like sauce, mention it in the description. The wife the Mediterranean pizza, which again, was just OK. The kids had mini corn dogs and spaghetti with meat sauce. I guess the spaghetti was fine but the other daughter didn't really like the corn dogs. I tried them and I'd have to say that I've had better (since I tend to get the leftovers :-) ). The service was a little slow the first time we went, but that was when they first opened so we understood. The second time, we had fine service, although the waiter was a little soft spoken. I like their ""deck"". It has what I'd refer to as glass garage door which allows it to be rolled up on warm days but rolled down when the weather is a little chilly. This gives you the opportunity to have that outside experience w/o the worries of the fickle Washington weather. As for the beer, the wife had a Harvest Hefeweizen and had the P.P Porter (Guinness like) . The porter was fine but after I tasted it I remembered I liked their stout better. The wife also remembered she liked the their pale ale better. Oh well.  I don't think we'd go back for the food but I'd be up for a beer on the deck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=560

Amazing combinations of fresh veggies and hearty meat?  Check!  Delicious cocktails?  Check.  Just as good as I remember!  Over the weekend when we came in we did have the worst service in the history of.... well, the history of the world.  It got to the point where it was comical how bad it all was.  What to do about the terrible experience? Let the manager know, who greatly apologized and made sure we left happy (and we certainly did).  Really, it's okay to complain here if you're not happy.  The fact that the manager and host were so accomodating about our bad service (and the fact that the pizza was amazing) made me one happy customer!  Will I let that one bad experience stop me from coming back?  Absolutely not.    Rumor has it they might open a location a little bit closer to Seattle.... and I will be their first customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=560

We were seated in a booth by the window, and then completely forgotten. There were only 4 or 5 other tables seated in the restaurant, and a seemingly full wait staff... but no one noticed that we were sitting there. No water or drink offerings, no silverware, and we only had menus because the hostess brought them when she sat us.

I ordered the Garden Medley Salad without feta, which was described on the menu as ""Crisp romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, fire-roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and our balsamic vinaigrette dressing."" It was a pile of not-crisp romaine, with the rest of the vegetables  chopped beyond recognition and spread around the edge of the plate as an afterthought. The dressing was not good- it tasted like low end bottled vinaigrette. It was not a $10 entree salad by any stretch.  My BF ordered steamed vegetables, which came slathered in butter. When he asked for them to be made without butter, he was told there was no butter on them. When I explained he just wanted them steamed- no butter, or olive oil, or whatever it was, they denied there being any added oils, though it was obvious that there was grease on the plate.

The one I most often order is supposed to be toasted, and when they brought it out the bread was disgustingly stale, sopping wet with dressing, and not toasted. They are close to where I work, and if it were not for convenience, I would never go there again. Also, I hate calling a restaurant that offers to go and curbside service who never answer their phones. Today when I called, it took calling four times and 20 minutes to get them to answer.

Gretchen B.,"Seattle, WA",26,143,,3.0,11/18/2008,"Now let me start by saying...this is a mall, chain, restaurant.  This isn't a fine dining four stars, but a mall four stars.  I spend lots of time at shopping malls and I have to say that of all the mall food.  BJ's is my favorite.  I have been here several times, even once or twice alone while I was working, and that alone (no pun intended) says alot.  The food here is very good.  I love their lunch special pizza and a salad.  This is deep dish pizza with crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside crust with a large topping assortment to choose from.  It is very filling and very very good.  I also like their pasta dishes, which unlike most chains are floating in grease and oil.  The shrimp scampi is quite good, angel hair pasta, light amount of sauce and lots of medium sized shrimp.  Now I am not saying you should get in your car and head down to Southcenter for your next meal, but if you find yourself hungry at the mall, this is a very good place to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=600
Guy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",402,219,137,3.0,8/6/2008,"Being from california, I know what BJ's is and I am very familiar with their menu and such. Seeing as this was the first one to open in the state of washington, I wanted to take my friends out so that they could try it. The food was really great. I always get the Santa Fe salad. Its really good. It tasted just like it should. However since it was their first week being open, they were still working some kinks out. For example. one of my friends didn't get his food until all of us had almost finished. I am not one to complain but I thought that was a bit ridiculous. Then when we asked to talk to the manager, it took him quite some time to get over to us. He told us he apologizes and that the servers are just trying to take care of the bigger parties. Not a good excuse if you ask me. He ended up comping out meal which is what he should do. Hopefully their service will get better as time goes by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=600
Steve B.,"San Francisco, CA",5,95,2,5.0,7/3/2009,"So, this place isn't 5 star fancy, but for pub food this is as good as it gets.  I went in at about 3:30 in the afternoon, just in time for their happy hour.  All mini pizzas are half price.  I had a three topping pan pizza for like $4.75 - and it was great!  Mix that with a waiter who was constantly refilling my iced tea on this 90 degree day and I'm a happy camper.  I'll be returning for sure, braving the flying bullets in the Southcenter parking lot.  Oh well, good food is worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=600
Chris W.,"Renton, WA",2,19,,5.0,5/26/2009,"I'm a homebrewer and have tried many of Seattle's finest, but have to say that some of BJ's brews are the best in the area.  The deep dish pizzas are incredible and I think BJ's has been able to produce a quality product despite being a chain.  I love the out of the way places, but this place keeps me coming back for the great food/beer.  I love sushi but thought it was funny that someone wrote a bad review and then talked about going to Sushi, lol.   Only in Seattle....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=600
Miko N.,"Renton, WA",58,12,,1.0,6/26/2009,"The food was nasty! We were a group of six, four adults, a 12 year old and 7 year old. They placed us in the ""family"" section next to a large table full of very loud kids. So, we let the girls play with their DS since we kept saying ""what did you say? I can't hear you."" I ordered the prime rib dip, my husband the BBQ beef sandwich, our family BBQ chicken pizza and chicken fried steak. The girls ordered Kraft mac and cheese and chicken tenders. Anything with BBQ sauce was gross. My husband described it as tasting like it had rubbing alcohol in it. Same sauce for the BBQ chicken pizza, so that was disgusting. My prime rib dip had no flavor and the au jus sauce tasted watered down. The chicken fried steak was not too bad, but didn't come with much sauce. Fries were alright; and kind of warm. Chicken tenders were ok and came with weird things that I believe were made out of potato. It was the form of a smiley face and were cold. The mac and cheese was gross. The one thing we did like was the service. We had a great waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tukwila?start=600
