Alanna F.,"Pasadena, CA",44,129,2,5.0,3/6/2016,I survived my early days of living here with this place.  The waitstaff are people you can connect with quickly and they are so helpful. I have had every salad on the menu plus the mozzarella cheese sticks.  Can't go wrong.   And the desserts.  Oh my goodness!  Try them all :). I have tasted all the chocolate desserts.  I watched the Winter Olympics here on one of the screens.  That's way fun :p,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Shawn H.,"Altus, AR",39,6,6,1.0,10/3/2017,"Ridiculous. Menu count? 9 menus. All requiring a cross reference to another menu for info. And they were all gross, sticky and dirty. Food was mediocre at best. Do not order the spinach dip. It came with deep fried possibly refried chewy tough leathery chips. I do not recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Maria S.,"Hot Springs National Park, Hot Springs National Park, AR",0,6,,2.0,11/27/2017,"We went there this past weekend at noon, and the restaurant was extremely dark inside. It almost felt depressing, and unlike any other Applebee's restaurant I've been to. I ordered the lime chicken meal, and the portion was tiny for a plate that cost over $11: one small chicken breast and about 1/2 cup of rice that was dry and tasted like it was heated up days before. The chicken had an extremely rubbery texture and was not good at all. My husband ordered a burger and fries and the burger looked like something that should be on a kid's menu. They definitely skimp on portion sizes and quality - it was our first time giving them a go in hopes that it would be good food and it just wasn't. Service was excellent though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Michael R.,"Princeton, NJ",1551,167,613,3.0,7/6/2016,"Decided on Applebee's as it was the closest option to my hotel. I had the sirracha shrimp appetizer which was tasty, but the breading on the shrimp was a bit too thick for my taste. My main was the pork chop with grilled veggies and mashed sweet potatoes. The pork was pretty good...but I have had much more tender cuts. The sides were good...but the mashed sweet potatoes were a bit on the rich side. That said, the service was excellent. Alyssa was my server and she basically doted on me all night. That was much appreciated!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Renee T.,"Springdale, AR",148,1,,3.0,9/4/2016,Just overly not impressed. An employee came in to eat...he took his infant to the kitchen. Not cool and probably a violation of some sort....then he sits to eat...gets on FaceTime with his mother...being extremely vocal.  The staff congregated around his table being loud and obnoxious. It was not a pleasant experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Stephen M.,"Monroe, NC",0,22,19,5.0,3/2/2017,Dropped by for dinner and served by Adam. Great waiter and mgmt.. Food selection amazing. Had the Siracha Shrimp which was very tasty. The Grilled Chicken and Shrimp I highly recommend as well. No complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Amanda B.,"Siloam Springs, AR",28,74,69,4.0,8/5/2015,"I had the Fajita wraps.  Not a bad choice if you've never authentic Mexican food.  They are good just lack the Mexican touch.   The manager was great.  My friend was picking out the tomatoes and he just walked over, offered her some without the tomatoes and wrap two new wraps. It was quick, kind, and he checked multiple times to make sure the food was just right.   I would recommend this location for the service and the general yummyness of their usaian food. I would steer clear of the Mexican section though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Summer T.,"Rogers, AR",0,6,6,5.0,6/24/2015,"Great place to stop in for a quick lunch or a few drinks with friends! Knowledgable bartenders keep your glasses full, and the kitchen is fast with appetizers. All employees seemed happy to be at work, and the atmosphere was very welcoming!  Love this place!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Eric C.,"Dallas, TX",128,9,6,5.0,3/9/2016,"Stopped in for lunch.  I was seated promptly, by a friendly gentleman at the front.  Joshua S was my waiter and he did a fantastic job.  He had the right balance of friendliness and prompt service.  Food was good.  Had the Salmon and an extra side of fries.  This is of course a chain store but if you are looking for fast and friendly service, this is the place.  I am betting the bar is a fun social scene at night base on some of the characters I overheard in conversation there late in the afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Cory M.,"Siloam Springs, AR",27,102,36,2.0,10/12/2015,"We probably will never try this place again. We stopped in before 6:00 for the 1/2 off appetizers. The waitress took so long that the clock turned 6:00 when she put the order in the computer. She came back to us saying there were no other options and suggested that we made another order in which we did but were not happy about it. The lady seemed to often. Most of our food came out correctly. She mostly just took way too long and forgot what she was doing the ladies behind us were ready to leave when we got there but they didn't get their check till our food came out. However, after all this the manager came by to see how things were going and we explained the deal and he was happy to get us our 1/2 off prices changed. So we may visit again for the sake of a great manager!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Stephen G.,"Farmington, AR",35,46,,1.0,11/8/2015,This one doesn't have very good people or food. It is the worst one to me in NWA. The one in Fayetteville is some better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Summer S.,"Lowell, AR",0,17,,5.0,7/14/2015,"This place is bangin'. The Buffalo wings appetizers are juicy, and spicy. The molten lava cake and Apple sangria is my favorite, the 2 for 1 combos are delicious. The service is a hit or miss but the food is always great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Spencer P.,"Lenexa, KS",16,6,,4.0,1/14/2015,"Better food, and service than most other Applebees. Standard setup.  Lots of tv's but none were HD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Vic M.,"Rogers, AR",7,25,11,4.0,5/24/2010,Standard applebees menu.  Atmosphere: Not very busy. Service is very attentive.  Check the specials board at the door.  They feature drink/meal specials around sports games. Watch-outs: They don't mind sitting families in the bar section. 2 times now we had to request not to be seated in the bar when there was an entire empty sections on the perimeter.  The food: Appetizers are the best bet if you are not sure what you want or marginally hungry.  Try the fish and chips.  It's fried but oh so good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Jonathan F.,"Webb City, MO",4,91,2,4.0,4/1/2011,I've been here twice now when visiting the NWA area.  Both times were around 11:30-12:00 and not much of a crowd.  This was very nice.  The service was fantastic.  I received my food quickly and it was exactly what I ordered.  The bar area has plenty of televisions to watch the game.  The roast beef sliders were excellent as was the shrimp and spinach salad.  I had the tomato and basil soup both times.  Very good. Definitely will be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
Gorden G.,"Springdale, AR",0,1,,3.0,2/1/2012,So I was hungry for some cougar action and put on my best wolf tshirt and went to to the local applebees. After striking out a couple times I decided to get drunk and met a a guy named terry. We hit it off pretty well watching hockey or some such mess. He mostly talked about his mother Irene. It seemed there was some issues there. I havent ever talked to Irene though so who knows how bad it really was. I met a girl she thought my wolf shirt was a hoot.      She was super cool but I later I found out she was a working girl. I had already spent all my money on 1 dollar jello shots. Too bad. There was a waiter that had a little floppy hair due. Not my thing but I really respected him. Ya know. So I pretty normal Wednesday really. I went home and watched star trek the next generation. But it was a Worf episode... :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-springdale-3
