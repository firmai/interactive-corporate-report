Stephanie M.,"Washington, DC",89,362,3,3.0,6/12/2009,"I'm typically not a huge fan of chains, but my mother is and this is so close to her house that it's programmed in my phone for curbside pickup. My mother and I ventured over last night, for a quick bite and a drink. I like this particular Chili's because the bartenders make a mean drink. They don't hold back, I'm convinced they don't even measure out the booze. Last night was kid's night, who knew, and the stiff drink hit the spot. The food is what you expect from these places, I got the choose three appetizer. I'm not sure what the portion sizes were supposed to be, but I took more than half home for lunch today. It reheated well. Our server was super friendly, attentive, the best part about her was when I asked for to go containers, she was smart enough to bring those little ones for the sauces. The bathroom was clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield
Winston R.,"Springfield, VA",4,31,,2.0,1/28/2013,"Chili's has pretty tasty food, but I tend to feel like crap after eating here. I think the food is super greasy or something. I eat out a lot, but tend to try to order stuff that isn't too unhealthy.  Service is hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield
Troy M.,"Hephzibah, GA",22,180,67,1.0,7/2/2012,"I like Chilis and frequent this chain often but this visit sucked.  Me and two friends went in for an early dinner. I ordered a steak cooked rare, it came out medium and it was very tough. One of my friends ordered a burger and the bun was very nearly burnt, overdone. For some reason it took almost an hour to get our food (it wasn't that busy). I had to request a knife with my steak (thought that was a no brainer) and I had to ask for  spoon for my friend who ordered tacos that came with a side of beans. Also at the end of the meal we asked for our check and a to-go box and then the waitress repeated it back to us with an attitude like it was the most inconvenient thing we could possibly ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield
Yvonne A.,"Fairfax, VA",26,51,34,2.0,3/10/2013,"it is not a fajita if doesn't have beans, rice and guacamole....the chicken was too white and plain...it is not mexican food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield
Lucy L.,"Burke, VA",0,26,6,4.0,4/2/2009,"I absolutely love Chili's Molten Ice cake.  The dessert is big enough for four people to share.  The first layer is a rich molten cake with warm ""lava"" in the middle, topped with vanilla ice cream, with a hard shell.  If you love chocolate, you'll love this!  Oh, and by the way, Chili's boneless buffalo wings are the best around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield
