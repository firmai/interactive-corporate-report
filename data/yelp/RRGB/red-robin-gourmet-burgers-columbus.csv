Vee C.,"Houston, TX",34,39,92,1.0,11/21/2017,"As I write this review I am drinking my beverage trying to wash away the burnt char taste from my over cooked dry burger! Red Robin has always been a place I wanted to eat since I was a kid. What a huge let down. The sever sucks! He brought us dirty glasses. What kind of place is this?? I took a pic of my overly charred burger. By this being my first time I am not sure if this is how they prepare there their burgers, if so, no thanks! The onions looked so good until I bit into one. The onion was undercooked. Sigh...why can't I just get a great burger great onion rings. The orange cinnarita was decent, nothing special. The Orange Cinnarita comes with Repspoluta Tequila so I was expecting a slight buzz from drinking it! Don't order the boneless Honey Dijon wings. I am sure they are tasty when freshly made and brought to your table immediately. Our's tasted like stale honey Dijon. The server did not take them away after we said we did not like them and ordered the bone in version so ended up paying for both. He just gave us a ton of excuses about how the wings are not breaded in house, WHAT? The table was so cluttered after the app's we had to put our old plates on another table because the server brought our entrees before doing so. Meanwhile I peeled the melted cheese off my burnt burger and turned it face up for the server to see, he walks over and says can I get you guys anything else? So I finally got a manger over to the table by asking another server. My server cleared the table before the manger got there. So I told him about how burnt my burger was. Are they suppose to taste charred? He said they are suppose to have a smoky taste to them but not burnt. I said yeah it was deeply blackened in the creases of the meat. He said, have you paid yet. I said my sister paid for her food. He said don't worry I got it. That was not my goal to get the manager to pay for my food. My goal was to order great tasting food and have a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus
Food C.,"Charlotte, NC",2,33,24,1.0,12/12/2017,Worst burger I've ever had! I was expecting a normal sized burger but received a McDonalds sized dollar menu burger. Both burgers that we ordered we're I've cold. We sent them back and they returned with cold burgers again. I ordered a side cup of clam chowder. It was disgusting also. It looked like macaroni and cheese not soup. It was very dry and fishy tasting. We were looking forward to beer and burgers and we were very disappointed. I will not be returning to Red Robin. On a positive note the waitress was very nice. The chicken tortilla soup was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus
Denise R.,"Phenix City, AL",0,40,15,2.0,7/26/2017,"hate to lower the star rating but I have to start by saying the food still was amazing just the staff and server we had. She was very overwhelmed and forgot so much and then just the time just took forever. We were there over an hour and half and the restaurant was maybe half full. There was another server working her butt off clearing tables, taking orders and even helping us with boxes. Seems like the quality of people they've hired recently has gone way down.

On Father's day it's was extremely slow, and unfortunately the service was too. Our orders took over an hour to come out, and my husband was served a salad that was mostly the core of the lettuce.

Carla M.,"Midland, GA",34,140,114,4.0,5/12/2016,"Despite other people's comments and experiences, I've yet to have a bad experience that makes me not want to come back.  This is the second location I eat at and is just as good if not better than the last one.  First of, I love the decorations around the place, all the different signs and sayings, I just love it. Then there's the burgers... I always have a hard time choosing because they all sound so good and when I finally decide, the taste and juiciness doesn't disappoint at all. The bottomless fries are delicious and the different sauces are great options too. I'm a sucker for pineapple and I've added it to my burgers here and they just taste soooo good. The only reason why I didn't give five stars I because although we had a great experience, I felt like they forgot about my beer order (they did upgrade me free of charge and apologized and the manager even came) but they still forgot and also the female bathroom needed work; the doors wouldn't close, there was paper towels busting out of the trash cans and I want to think it was water running down the floor. I think there's definitely room for improvement, but not a bad experience. Our server was also very pleasant and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus

Esra M.,"Columbus, GA",52,118,138,1.0,2/12/2016,"Horrible Service!!! Second time we went here and the service is still bad. The first time, they welcomed us and then just looked at us. Uuuhm... can we have a table for two or are you not working here?! Then yesterday, we were offered a high table in the front area/ at the bar - no thanks. Can we please have a booth? Oh , you do have one available? Yes please and thank you! We ordered our drinks and food and it took 10min for the drinks to come. Our waitress did not once offer a refill or ask if we would like something else. It's rather like she tried to ignore us so we don't bother her with an order. Second, the food took more than 30min to arrive and it didn't even arrive at the same time! According to the waitress, someone else ""snatched his burger away"". Oh really? You want to tell me that somebody else ordered the vegan boca burger with guacamole and an extra sauce on the side? I don't think so! And why would I want to start with my food when it's going to take another 15min for my husband's food to arrive? So he can first watch me while I eat, and then I watch him while he eats? LOL! To that, my burger came out luke warm, and my side of broccoli was cold! I asked if they could please take it back and bring me another one the same time my husband's food comes out..............Ok so 5min later, both our food comes out. The manager on duty apologized and said that someone lost his order. His boca burger is warm and fresh - mine on the other hand is luke warm again and they microwaved my broccoli. Are you serious?! If I want microwaved broccoli, I can warm up my dinner from last night! They didn't take care of anything on the receipt, the waitress didn't check back on us the whole time and ignored us until I had to stop her and ask for a refill on my drink. I will not come back to this place. The food itself is ok but the organization in there and the service are the worst!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus

Cathy W.,"Montezuma, GA",20,5,,1.0,6/6/2016,"This review is for night shift, lunch crew and food are fabulous! The same cannot be said of night/evening shift.  We got there at 8:30 pm and ordered our drinks.  I ordered spinach dip and cheese sticks.  Our usual.  We ordered some fairly simple items as entrées.  I ordered a shroom burger.  My husband ordered a French dip sandwich.  My son ordered clucks and fries.  An hour after we got there our food  finally came out.  Mine was soggy.  My husband's was cold, seriously cold! My son said his was fine, but he prefers his food lukewarm at best.  He sure didn't have to wait for it to cool at all.  We noticed that our waiter, who shall be known as man-bun, seemed to be conversing heavily at other tables.  Man-bun couldn't even be bothered to get us straws, we had to ask another waiter, that we've had before on day shift for straws when he brought out our appetizers.  Man-bun still hadn't gotten our meal order, but he sure was conversing.  He stopped by long enough to get our order, but he still hadn't brought out my husband's coffee that he ordered.  After that man-bun went back to conversing.  I'm saying he was conversing because the restaurant was nearly empty, he had 3 tables max including us.  He goes in off the floor and tells us our food is almost ready.  I'm thinking how the h-e-double hockey sticks would you know. When he finally brought out our food in the above mentioned condition we flagged down the hostess, who is there almost every time we come in.  We found my hubby's cold mess first.  She took it back to be remade.  Then I cut my burger in half and tried to pick it up.  It was a cool, brown, soggy mess on the bottom. I sent mine back with our waiter, who happened by.  We talked to the manager and told her to just bring us the check after taking our meals off.  (I didn't feel like eat revenge food.) She tried telling me that the shroom burger can get pretty soggy.  I told her that I have had the same burger every time we have gone there in the last 2 years, never has it been soggy before and cool.  We were there the previous Friday afternoon without the drama or soggy/cold meals.  By the time we got out of there, it had been over an hour.  Our previous meals were out and done in 30 minutes or less.  Same meal each time. I will reiterate that day shift is fast.  The food is always awesome.  The wait staff seem to remember that they are waiting tables rather than gossiping.  We normally give great tips for great service. My advice is to go for lunch.  If it is past 6 you may have an experience similar to ours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus

Alan T.,"Tacoma, WA",48,20,21,2.0,2/26/2015,"I have to say that I frequent this place somewhat often. Maybe once every 2 weeks. This review is the result of 3 consecutive bad experiences. When it's consecutive, it's a sign of consistency.  1st experience: 4 people at the table and everyone of us didn't get what we ordered (no cheese, or no bun, or no dressing). Simple server error with little communication in the kitchen.  2nd experience: food quality. Chicken fingers for the kid was mostly breading and small amounts of chicken....not being nit-picky, it was obvious that the ratio was way off. Burger was sloppy (lettuce wrap was anything but wrapped. Just slapped a 1/4 head of lettuce on the top and bottom). 2/4 of us got tummy ache after eating.  3rd experience: more food quality. The jalapeño coins were noticeably different. Instead of the breading they used before to fry the coins, it looked and tastes like tempura batter. That is fine but if u remove a bit of the batter you can see that the flour breading (uncooked and dry) was jammed in there and it was Yuky (I took a pic of it and posted it here). We notified the server just as a heads up, not a complaint at all, and the server didn't even say anything to anyone. We saw and confirmed. Server didn't take the coins back, didn't show the cooks, didn't inform the manager, didn't take it off the bill. The burger patys were a bit sub-par and again, we got some tummy aches after.  Needless to say, I don't think we will be back. It's sad because I liked this place. I think there are new cooks in the back and some servers are just ""there"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=20

Jake W.,"Columbus, GA",0,58,,3.0,8/11/2012,Upon being seated the first thing I had to do was clear the food off my seat. The waiter was prompt and friendly. Our burgers were tasty with good but limp fries. Lots of noise but that is to be expected. Price is a bit high but not out of sight. Will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40

Steve W.,"Columbus, GA",0,6,,3.0,1/22/2009,"Red Robin is a pretty typical ""fancy"" burger place - lots of different style sandwiches, including a teriyaki and pineapple burger, blue cheese burger, (insert adjective here) burger!  Service is about par for the course, helpings are good, and most plates come with neverending steak fries. But honestly...that's all I can think of to write about them.  There is nothing else really worth mentioning, and when this place goes out of business (as it really will, $10 burger plates won't last in the current economy), I probably won't miss it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Kushondra S.,"Columbus, GA",6,46,22,5.0,12/18/2010,Oh my gosh. The best burger on the planet! The staff is super friendly. You feel welcome the moment you hit the door. I love the decor. Burger is a bit pricey but you get what you pay fro. Go to the web site to sign up for the birthday burger. You get a free one on your birthday. They even have a menu for the health conscious! Try it you will not regret it! Red Robin... yum!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Katie E.,"Atlanta, GA",0,12,,3.0,6/23/2013,I've been there & it's been pretty good but then went there & ordered chicken and it wasn't cooked all the way & I got grossed out & won't go back.  The manager slightly apologized and did not make me pay for my chicken but otherwise didn't seem concerned about it.  I do think the burgers are good but now I won't take my family back because of the chicken thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Lucas V.,"Vacaville, CA",11,42,5,4.0,11/14/2010,A great place for any burger lover. They have a huge selection and they are always coming up with new creations.  The onion ring appetizer is a great deal and plenty to share for 3+. prices are pretty average but you get a big helping!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Edward C.,"Columbus, GA",6,16,1,2.0,12/24/2012,Over priced hamburger and all you can eat french fries don't make up for the price. I've been to Red Robin(s) in Southern California and this one doesn't make the grade.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Sierra C.,"Columbus, GA",5,33,2,5.0,9/9/2012,"Frequented the Red Robins in Folsom, CA and Rancho Cordova, CA often as that is the area I grew up in. Have always loved their fries and their other menu items. Always been a great place to take the kids. No pressure to keep them silent throughout the entire meal and lots of fun stuff on the walls and around the restaurant for them to look at. This Red Robin was not different in that respect. What really stands out about this Red Robin though is the service! We've gone 3 times since we moved here 3 months ago and have been lucky enough to have Stevie as our server twice. She is out of this world! Just the sweetest most attentive server I have ever met! We never had empty drinks, we never had empty fries, we never had to stop her to ask for something because she was already there asking if we needed anything else (but not in a hovering overbearing way that servers can sometimes get!). Upon leaving (both times we had her) she brought us to-go cups of our drinks. WOW! We didn't even have to ask. That is SERVICE! The server we had our 3rd time was great too- not as good as Stevie, but still gets an A for service.  Great team you have, Red Robin, Columbus! Keep it up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Andy P.,"Knoxville, TN",22,333,,3.0,1/19/2009,"Burgers and fries were probably a four. Service was a five. Atmosphere was a one and a half! We were told it was a burger place similar to a Friday's that focused on burgers. It was more like a Chucky Cheese that served good burgers. Lots of screaming kids, balloons, teenybopper music, and an average age of about 17. I guess if you are looking for that - I'd give it a four. We were not looking for that. If you are looking for a ""gourmet"" burger in a nice restaurant - skip this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
Michael J.,"Columbus, GA",10,13,,5.0,3/21/2010,"Out of all the Burgers I've had in all the restaurants I've been in across this country Red Robin has been the best so far. I love the Whisky River Burger. And yes I've had Fudruckers (second favorite) and 5 Guys (Burger King is better). But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=40
