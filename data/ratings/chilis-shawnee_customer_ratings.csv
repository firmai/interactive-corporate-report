13,Claudia S.,"Overland Park, KS",85,814,172.0,2.0,2013-03-10,"Chili's is okay. There are things there I like, but it's not like the most exciting thing. We were there right when they opened on Saturday for an early lunch. Our waitress was friendly enough. The floor still had puddles of water from mopping/hosing down the restaurant.  The menus were disgustingly sticky. I asked the waitress if they had hand santizer. They don't. I said okay. When she took our order, she took the menus and threw them right back in the pile of menus (sorry to the next people who received those gross menus!) I went to the restroom to clean up and brought back a wet towel to wash down the table where the menus had been. She continued to be disinterested. Seriously, we had to PEEL the pages of the menu apart to read them. Anyway, we had a coupon for a free appetizer. I love their chips and salsa. We got Queso since it was free (comes with salsa too). Their queso dip kind of looks like it came out of a diaper. It's not that good, but we still ate some of it. Our fries were really good dipped in it. We shared an entree of chicken crispers. They were a little soggy with oil, but they are still really good. The honey mustard was yummy. I'm not usually a fan of corn on the cob due to the mess, but theirs is so yummy, I eat it anyway. We had a good meal, but the server (who was NOT BUSY AT ALL) was not attentive. I got a refill, but my dining partner didn't get one until I waved the glass over my head (yes, I did). They were all just standing around staring into space. One of the servers (not OUR server) came over to me and said ""Do you need something?"" I looked down at the empty glass and said ""HMMM...what do you think?"" One time our waitress was eager to help was when she offered to keep the change for her tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,

14,Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54.0,1.0,2014-08-25,"Our one and only trip here was on a Sunday evening.  The fries were cold on the first attempt, lukewarm on the second attempt (and delivered by the manager).  The service was pretty slow. Given the choice between this Chili's or skipping dinner, I'll choose skipping dinner, as it's free!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
19,Nida K.,"Shawnee, KS",0,3,,2.0,2014-09-28,"I would like to start by saying that I work in a fine dining restaurant. When I go out to eat I do have expectations of the kind of service I should get but I am realistic about them. When I came to Chili's I expected to get waters have a decently polite server get the food I ordered pay my bill and leave. My experience was less than satisfying.  The server we had seemed dismissive but maybe a bit shy. We ordered our food I got a beer and my guest had mango tea. My beer was not what I ordered however, the bartender took care of me and solved my issue, she wasn't the most pleasant person but she did well enough. This is why I rated 2 stars instead of 1.  The food while not awful or inedible was unpleasant. My guest got a salad that was drenched in some sort of syrup (I'm assuming from the mandarin oranges) The lettuce became so soggy she was unable to eat it. I would not recommend this location, I paid $30 for a meal we didn't eat only to come home and make dinner.  Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
17,Bill ..,"Shawnee, KS",0,25,,1.0,2014-10-20,"Terribly slow service. They freely admit they are understaffed and have been for ""about four months."" This screams of poor management. Had to ask the hostess if it was serve yourself night after not seeing a server for for first 15 minutes after arrival. The dining room was not even full. The ribs and veges were not bad when they arrived but they forgot to do the guacamole tableside as they have been advertising. I believe this is limited to this location, however.  Went to a work lunch at the Chili's at 119th and Metcalf and had a gery good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
15,Stephanie P.,"Kansas City, KS",40,144,54.0,5.0,2015-01-07,"When I eat, I usually stay away from chains, but Chili's it is when I go to one! This is one of my two favorite Chili's in the area. The staff and servers at this Chili's are friendly and efficient. My tea is always full and my order always correct. They have a much better food selection than rival Applbee's. Better value too.  One thing about this Chili's I really like is that there is ample parking. Lots of dine in and to go parking both.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
11,Laurel S.,"Shawnee, KS",61,405,3.0,3.0,2015-06-23,"Seriously, it's CHILI'S but my daughter really wanted to go here so we went.  The food is fine. Nothing to write home about.  The thing I like about Chili's - if you are at the airport they are too :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
18,Olathe R.,"Olathe, KS",0,18,,1.0,2015-07-03,"The cook forgot to put tomato sauce on the pizza. It was dry & not edible. They made up for it with wet, drippy chicken quesadillas. The manager agreed that the pizza was supposed to have sauce and that the quesadillas weren't usually soggy. She explained, ""We have a new cook. Sort of.""  The mgr said she would take care of our meal. But the waitress brought a check to the table anyway, giving less than half-credit for the uneaten meals. We paid the bill then went to another restaurant for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
16,Michael B.,"Bonner Springs, KS",10,24,74.0,4.0,2015-08-21,"I'll give it a 4 just because of the bartender Brandon.  He is so attentive and on point.  He's not over powering, but spot on with customer service and quality.  There's another girl didn't catch her name but she has tatoo's (so do i) she is so friendly and is like Brandon. Very fun and attentive. I'm just sorry I didn't ask for them and got some one else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
10,Dustin H.,"Blue Springs, MO",52,39,39.0,3.0,2015-09-29,"Mediocre place to eat. We came during happy hour, but no one told us it was happy hour. If we would have known our orders would have been different. But that happens. I had a margarita which was way to much mixer. Next we did the pick three appetizers fried pickles were bland, cheddar cheese balls where good, and the southwest egg rolls were great. Next being Tuesday I tried their special old timer Tuesday burger w cheese fries. Burger was great for 5.49 it really saved the meal. Other half order a club which was too dry so she swapped it for the soup. Loaded bake potato which was on spot. Waiter was busy flirting w a table of girls so not the best service. I'd try it again just not in a rush....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
12,Brandon D.,"Lenexa, KS",34,214,45.0,1.0,2016-01-04,"This is one of the very few places that I've officially blackballed.  I will not eat here again; which is sad, because just a few years ago, it was a decent to good place to eat.  My final 3 experiences were all horrible.  First of all, it's about a 15 minute jaunt from where I live, which is fine for take-out...unless you get home and your order is messed up.  Ordered quesadillas (plain/chicken with cheese) and a steak (medium rare) with a baked potato.  Got loaded quesadillas with everything (including onions which I'm allergic to), a steak (burned/well done/crispy) with fries.  Called to complain...manager said to bring it back.  At the risk of starving to death; I did so.  Checked the order when I got there and it was still wrong.  Finally after an hour and a half, the right order was had.  Cue next visit...came in and ate at the bar.  Took nearly 20 minutes to get a drink (granted, it was 4:30 and could be shift change...but people saw me...come on now), ordered food...came out wrong yet again...had to wait for the order to be corrected again.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  Last straw was the last visit back in May that ended up being a nearly identical experience to the first mentioned here.  When you get simple orders wrong, don't cook food properly, are forewarned of food allergens, and don't really do anything to make it right...you get blackballed.  Why would you go here with Barley's, Jose Peppers, and Paulo & Bill's a couple minutes to the South?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
9,Marilyn S.,"Shawnee, KS",2,60,2.0,4.0,2016-08-15,"We had a party of four.  One of our members is slightly handicapped and uses a Walker.  We were seated by a young woman named Heather I believe.  She immediately took charge and helped seat our friend, even pushed her chair up to the table.  Moved the Walker out of the way.  Our waiter was good.  A bit busy.  Good for restaurant hard for her.  We got our salads about one second before the main course.  We enjoyed our meals, two bbq ribs and two classic steaks.  Well prepared.  Our drinks were reasonably priced and we enjoyed our time spent there and will go back.  When we stood to go, again the young lady was there to help us leave.  Good for you Manager whoever you are.  Your staff reflects your restaurant and this was a positive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
6,Mitch L.,"Shawnee, KS",47,3,,1.0,2016-12-11,So my son and myself walked in the door and had a friendly greeting.... and then yeah it all went south from there.  1. My son was given an adult menu. He's 7.  2. Waited 15 minutes to have a server come to our table.  3. Took our drink orders and never brought them to us over the next 10-15 minutes.  4. Finally decided to walk out and told the hostess on the way out that we were leaving and he was slumped over the little hostess table like he was trying to catch some sleep.  WORST SERVICE EVER TODAY!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,

5,Craig A.,"Lenexa, KS",23,9,,2.0,2017-06-20,"We had been coming here weekly.. ever since it had opened. But we have noticed that over last 6ish months the service is not what it used to be.  It is very slow from taking your order, getting food to finalizing the bill.  Wait staff training has a lot be desired.  Management needs to better manage employees And restaurant from what I've seen.  And I eat out a lot!  Will not patronize this Location again  For a long time. Hopefully it gets turned around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
3,Jamie J.,"Shawnee, KS",3,89,14.0,3.0,2017-09-13,"We stopped by for a late Sunday afternoon lunch which resulted in a less busy restaurant.  We were in no means in any hurry nor did we give that vibe...it's Sunday, NO ONE should be in a hurry.  Anyway, our waiter wasted no time in asking us right after our food arrived if we wanted to split the check.  I mean, let me enjoy my first bite and then ask for my money!  We kindly responded with our payment preference and moved on with our food.  I really enjoyed my grilled chicken salad as it seems to work out better to have the dressing on the side.  Our afternoon experience was not disappointing so we'll probably be back at some point in the future, but it wasn't anything to write home about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
4,Kim M.,"Olathe, KS",0,5,,1.0,2017-11-06,"Food was decent.But do not go here unless you want to track down your waiter to get the correct change back. When it came time to pay our bill was $27 something. I have a $25 gift card so I put that down, along with a $20 dollar bill because I had nothing smaller. We get our money back and it is only 3 dollars....Um hello! The register should tell you the correct change to give me back. We had to go to the bar (we were sitting on this side). Call our waiters attention and explain the difference. He then gave us 11 back. Still not even the right amount. I had errands to run and didn't care to keep going around with this guy since math is just too hard for him. But fair warning if you go be sure to double check your bill, what you were charged, and the amount of cash you receive back. We will not be returning to this location or probably any Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
2,Jason C.,"Edwardsville, KS",22,22,42.0,5.0,2017-12-08,"We enjoy sitting in the bar section at this location. Service is always good and fast, and they always have good coupons for a free appetizer if you sign up for their email list. And I love their Skillet Queso! That is by far and away my favorite thing on their menu. Tuesdays are burger nights, and it offers a good value for a good basic cheeseburger. They have some really good desserts as well, not that I ever order them because I'm too full from the queso and the meal. Wish they had a larger draft beer selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
0,Mel D.,"Lenexa, KS",0,34,6.0,5.0,2017-12-09,"I don't usually give 5-Stars to just any Joe-Shmoe restaurant, but the service at this Chili's, puts this rating up there. The servers are the nicest, and most accommodating, that I've ever seen in one location - no joke.  It's also becoming my husband's new favorite burger place. He is also very impressed that they still serve the Country Fried Steak, which was always a favorite of his. At Chili's locations in other states, they stopped selling it, and put hot spices in all the other dishes, which made us stop going there. I can highly recommend the Buffalo Wings, and Fajitas also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
1,Pat L.,"Lenexa, KS",0,13,,1.0,2017-12-19,"We have gone to this Chili's regularly for years but.....will not ever go back.  Management has work to do.  Restaurant was 1/3 full if that and it took 20 minutes to get a table ready.  The guy shuffled around talking to people while we waited....could've been seated 15 minutes before.  Server was absent for so long between seating and ordering we had to ask someone to find her. Food when it finally came was ok...just ok..had to hunt her down for refills, bill, etc.  wish I'd read the other reviews before I wasted my money tonight.  Worst Chili's in the chain.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee,,,,,
