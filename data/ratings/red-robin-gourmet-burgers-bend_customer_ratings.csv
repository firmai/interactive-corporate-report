One friend ordered an appetizer, and it came out quickly. My friend and I ordered burgers, and our other friend ordered a chicken sandwich. I ordered the guac-bacon burger, add mushrooms, with cheddar cheese, and sweet potato fries. Our food orders came out together. My plate had french fries on it. I immediately mentioned this to the server, and he said he'd get me some sweet potato fries. I bit into my burger, and realized there was no cheese on it. I asked the server for some cheddar cheese. He offered to have my burger remade, and I declined. I just wanted the cheese. After he brought me the cheese, he checked my ticket in the computer and said he had put everything in correct, and the manager was speaking to the kitchen about the issues. A few minutes later, the manager came out and told me the server had put the order in wrong. I work in the food industry, and I KNOW that whatever comes up on the receipt is going to be what was put in. The receipt had what I ordered on it, not what came to the table. So, I ask the following questions: 1) Where are my sweet potato fries? 2) Where is my cheddar cheese? 3) WHY IS THE MANAGER TRYING TO LIE TO ME AND TRYING TO COVER UP A MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE BY THE KITCHEN?!?

You either get it with your meal or seriously now, after.

The burgers used to be sent through machine and slightly grilled. Now they grill them and burn them every time regardless of some pink no pink or well done.

76,Nancy W.,"Bend, OR",0,15,,1.0,2014-08-10,"Used to go to the Red Robin's in San Diego for years and loved them. My fiancé and I have come to this one twice, and this 2nd visit will be our last.  Came a little after 3pm on a Saturday. Not too busy, we were seated promptly, the waitress asked what she could get us a little fast, but we knew we wanted a good local IPA (which they don't have good choices of). She got us our beer, asked us what we wanted to order -we weren't ready, she came up not even a minute later (and I felt she was in a hurry at this point). Then we're ready to order, I put the menus at the edge of the table to show we were ready, FINALLY after at least 10 minutes a different waiter came up and said the other girl was busy, and took our order (2 new gourmet burgers).  We waited.... and waited... and waited........ and waited. My fiancé ordered a 2nd beer. We waited.... and then we noticed the couple sitting at the table across from us that got seated about 15-20 minutes after we placed our order got their food!!! We FINALLY got our food and -- low and behold --it was COLD -all of it!, the fries, everything.  I was starving, but this was unacceptable ----especially to pay $13.95/each for?? And they didn't look good, it was obvious it had been sitting for a while.   So we just simply, without making a big stink, said it was cold, we're not eating it, just cash us out and we left. It happened the last time we were there. They apologized (not profusely or anything), didn't offer anything -no discount on the outrageously expensive beer, or anything -just said sorry. I had gotten a 22oz (yes, they are pretty big), and my fiancé got 2 16oz beers. The bill came to over $18 bucks. Uuggh...quite disappointing. We will never go here again. You can go to 10Barrel (which we do, often) --even though it's always jam-packed but get EXCELLENT service and MUCH better burgers, awesome beer for a few dollars less.

80,Alan S.,"Loomis, CA",0,16,,2.0,2015-07-20,"We visit this restaurant once a year during our annual family trek to Sunriver.  I often visit other Red Robin's establishments (i.e., Roseville, CA) and so am very familiar with the Red Robin style of service and it's brand.  On this visit, we had several issues which resulted in an overall poor experience.  In talking with the manager, he stated that this restaurant is under a different type of ownership compared to other Red Robin establishments (some type of independent ownership)....so I wonder if this is contributing to the service issues that we experienced.   The food is likely to be the same from Red Robin to Red Robin, so what will make this restaurant a success (or lack of) is its service.  First challenge....the restaurant does not carry all of the items on the menu which dissappointed my guests (no salmon, no gardenburger).  Second challenge....the food took over 30 minutes to be delivered to our table.   Third challenge...everyone's food was lukewarm (e.g., fries, burgers, mac n cheese).   Fourth challenge....bathrooms were filthy (it was the end of the day but I'm not sure why I should have to experience less then clean).   Fifth issue...waitress spilled salad dressing over new shoes (I understand that mistakes happen, but this usually results in a automatic visit from the manager - but he was a no show).   Sixth issue...the waiter staff seemed more fixated on closing down the restaurant than taking care of us.  Seventh issue (the biggest problem of all in my opinion)....I asked to speak to the waiter twice and he never came (note - we waited over 20 minutes for him to show-up).  Eventually I had to go find the manager myself as the family was ready to go.  In explaining the challenges, the manager took 20% off the bill, and gave me to coupons for $14 toward a future visit (note - only good in Bend though).   Based on our experience tonight, the entire meal should have probably been 50% or more off.  What we did enjoy was sitting outside along the river....very peaceful and entertaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80,2.8,2.8,2.8,1.9920000000000002,2.8

Buns are cheap with painfully obvious frozen patties that are thinner and lower in quality compared to fresh hand crafted beef patties of the past. Serving portions of fries reduced to a minimum that make it disuading to keep  asking for more. Caesar salad is now a small head of romaine lettuce placed intact in a bowl with a little bit of dressing drizzled on top. Seriously, you can't even cut up the lettuce? Oh, and finally for dessert, a Oreo ""milk shake"". A SMALL amount of crappy vanilla ice cream cut with probably skim milk mixed with the equivalent of one oreo for $3.99. There is more value in an old school ice cream sandwich and I get to scrape the chocolate wafer residual off my index finger and thumb with my teeth when I'm done with the main treat.  I feel sorry for those working in this puppy mill of a restaurant chain.

We go here once a month for the fish and chips which are, to me, the best in the area.

We've been to many Red Robin's all over the western USA, and the location of this one in Bend Oregon is one of the nicest places in the entire west. It's just beautiful here. But after about 15 visits to this location we're getting reluctant to go back because the service is consistently so incredibly slow. The waitresses are very courteous and friendly, I'm not sure why it's so slow. Also they have like the endless fries, well, if they never come back to ask if you want more that's kinda pointless. One time my wife flagged down the young lady, and 20 minutes later she'd still never brought anymore. Another 20 minutes from when you've obviously ended your meal to getting your check has to be a record of any place I've ever been.

The fries are bottomless and tasty with the Red Robin seasoning salt. Food is pretty consistent here. You know what you are getting. Not fabulous but good enough. Besides burgers, the chicken strips are meaty and not too covered in breading. I always get the Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap. My son likes the BLTA served on a croissant. The daughter varies between a Simple Burger vs Gardenburger. Burgers can also be served on lettuce only. They also have turkey burgers. The atmosphere is loud and so very family friendly. No one will be bothered when your younger child fusses. Lots of birthdays here. Singing and ice cream provided. Really the best thing is appetizers on the deck, in my opinion. View of the river. Old mill atmosphere. Just really quite nice and not terribly expensive! Tried the deep fried broccoli last night and liked it!! Also there is a $3 wedge salad that is the best deal around!!

As for the food, their signature burger, the Reds Tavern double, came smashed down with under cooked fries.  They were very accommodating in replacing the meal, but after waiting for a clean table, it was irritating to wait again for my order to arrive correct.  The burger was good, not as good as it usually is at other Red Robin's and the fries were still not their normal deliciousness.   Hopefully this was just an off night.

Hadn't been there in a long time and decided to do a date afternoon with my wife. The hostess podium is dirty and in need of repair. The restaurant could use a lot of cleaning. The table top was old, worn out and sticky.  The menus also were sticky and felt like they were in need of sanitizing.  The servers used to be awesomely friendly and attentive. Used to be. Ours was slow and didn't really seem to care about customer service.  For example; when my wife asked for iced tea, he did not question whether she wanted regular or one of the various flavors they offer, she really wanted to try the raspberry. He brought her regular iced tea and a water for me. As he walked off I asked,  ""what about my beer?"" He turned around and said, ""oh, that will be right out."" When he finally delivered it, I took a few swigs then noticed a chunk of something brown on the bottom of the mug (I should have taken a picture), it looked like bird poop or something. I flagged him down and when he came over I pointed it out to him  and asked what he thought it was.  He said, ""oh it's brownie"" and went on to tell me that they serve dessert with brownie crumbles at the bar where he picks up the drinks. I told him it looked gross. He grabbed a napkin, wiped it off and said, ""there, problem solved."" I'm no expert, but I think most places would have brought me another one without the brown whatever on it.  The food used to be really good...........used to be. Both our burgers were luke warm when delivered to our table. The meat was 1/2 as thick as they used to be and although we both ordered them with ""a little pink"" they were both over cooked and dry. The Whiskey R8ver BBQ burger hardly had any BBQ sauce on it and although I ordered it without onions, yup, you guessed it, it had onions. When the server came by and asked how everything tasted, I said, ""ok, but I ordered this without onions."" His reply, ""oh, I didn't even think about the shoestrings."" We used to really enjoy our visits at Red Robin.............used to. Next time I am craving a good burger with a big juicy patty, served hot and the way I ordered it,  we'll go to Hardy's on 3rd street in Bend or Big Belly Burger and Brews in Sunriver.  Bye, bye Red Robin. I won't be wasting my hard earned $$$ there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
30,Denise B.,"Redmond, OR",0,25,3.0,1.0,2017-05-28,Let's start with the service. The service was good. That is the only reason for the 1-STAR. Other than that this was my first time at this Red Robin. I had the Marco Polo and immediately went into the bathroom that was 4 hours ago and I haven't been able to get away from the bathroom since. It had to be something that was on that burger I was totally fine before eating there. I've never had this happen before. Not recommending this Red Robin and I won't go back there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
23,Dawn D.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-05-29,"This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've ever been to. The hostess laid our kid's menu right on top of some food left in the table from the previous diner -- either oblivious to the fact that the table was poorly cleaned or ignoring it. We asked them to clean the table and specifically asked them to fold down the table edge and clean in the crack where the table folds down. EWWWW. It's obvious that cleaning is a low priority. Even looking around now, the floor is littered with paper, crayons and just... trash. The chrome bar running behind our table is riddled with grimy fingerprints. I don't even want to think about the menu. Why is our table sticky? I need to go wash my hands. Again.  And, BTW, what's up with the TV in the bathroom stall?! Is that a normal thing for you guys?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
7,Di R.,"Los Angeles, CA",584,358,116.0,5.0,2017-06-15,The food was great. They have an amazing menu with reasonable price. Sarah was so cute and so perky and patient. (And I mean reeeally patient!!) But made everyone feel comfortable and as if she was happy that we were asking her a dozen questions!

20,S B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,4.0,1.0,2017-06-21,"Great setting on the river, nice waitress that took our order. After delivering our food she vanished.  I craved a good salad and ordered the Cobb salad. The menu said mixed greens but all iceberg. Salads were very light on condiments, maybe a half a piece of bacon, and maybe a teaspoon of blue cheese, couple pieces of egg.. twelve fifty, really! They both had a mini chicken breast, really disappointed. We rarely get fries so when we do it's a treat. These were saturated in grease and soggy, unedible. When a server finally brought the bill he took off the fries. They do have very cold beer.  I suppose stick to burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
17,Cassie G.,"St. Helens, OR",3,28,9.0,2.0,2017-06-25,"Red Robin is what it is. Nothing to complain about the menu or options etc. But I've been to a few an this is by far the dirtiest. Service was so so. Our server looked to be about 15 and seemed a little scattered but she was trying very hard and was sweet. For a Saturday concert night I was shocked at how short staffed they were, maybe that is why it was so dirty? There a several stops along the river to eat, skip this one if you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
21,Linnea S.,"Sheridan, OR",101,6,,4.0,2017-06-27,Red Robin is what it is and I got what I expected. I would go back. Service was friendly and relatively prompt. I had a burger that was good. Ordered a berry lemonade which wasn't great or fresh so I got a chocolate milkshake instead which was really yummy. This restaurant is in a great location next to the Deschutes river.

Food was sitting in the window under the lamps for about 10-15 minutes and when we Finally got it many burgers and fries were cold, My family didn't say anything but I sent mine back and got something else.

I ordered the blue cheese angus burger which didn't even have a price by it so I assumed 12.00 at the most. My parents got the 6 dollars siracha deal they had going on , thats what I should have got they bring me this burger on a ""fancy yuppie plate"" I guess to give the illusion it was huge, it looked like a slider , tiny little burger!!! My parents burgers where 5 x bigger and better tasting and looking then the check comes , at this point my stomach was starting to gurgle and I knew I was about to blow blue cheese out my ol' bung hole in their bathroom but I pinched my cheeks to read the ticket.... 15.45 for that f'ing slider that had already went through me , needless to say thank god the shopping centers are close because I had to purchase a new pair of panties after getting f'ed.I will leave Red Robins shitty chain food alone for now on.

10,Eddie T.,"Oregon City, OR",0,14,,1.0,2017-10-16,"First off, the food was OK (as expected) but the order was incorrect (ordered sweet potato fries, served regular fries.)   The friendly staff quickly corrected the mistake, but then we had to ask for silverware.  Our server (Julien) was friendly and courteous, but maybe a bit over-tasked with his tables.  Second off, this place is DIRTY.  The table tops have achieved a state of ""PERMA-STICKY"" and the seats had food debris on them when we were seated.  Had to ask for napkins to clean our booth up... yuck.  Chipped paint on the walls, food or beverage splatters on the ceiling above the pass-through.  The carpets and cove-base are filthy... like sticky-filthy.  It's really sort of depressing.  No pay stations at the tables, no mention of customer loyalty program like at other Red Robins... this is like the Red Robin that time (and cleaning supplies) have forgot. We occasionally visit other Red Robins when traveling (Clackamas, Woodburn, etc.) and this place isn't even in the same universe.  Wondering if this is the difference between a franchised store and a corporate-ran store?  Either way, this place needs to be shut down for some deep cleaning and painting, and refresher courses for the wait staff on the small details of service they may be overlooking.   Won't likely be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
12,Jake U.,"Bend, OR",3,4,,1.0,2017-10-25,"It used to be good, back when John Churm was at the helm.  we went in for dinner last night after our oldest sons football game. Things have changed greatly and not in a good way. The server was good at first until she took our order. What she wrote down was not even close to what we ordered. After about 25 minutes the food arrives  we ordered 2 sides onion rings, they weren't delivered. I ordered a royal Red Robin nope it was missed, instead something else was brought out I'm not even sure what is was. I told the food runner I didn't order what she brought out she looked puzzled and promptly apologized for the mistake not her fault. I then told her about the onion rings, she reacted right away to fix the issue, after another 25 minutes of waiting my burger finally makes it appearance my family is pretty much done eating at this point. And I was just getting started. Mine was ok, my wife's was burnt to a crisp ours kids burgers looked like they had been smashed by the palm of someone's hand, onion dark brown and greasy due to old fryer oil. no napkins or silverware where brought to the table. It's Red Robin I don't expect world class service Or  food but get your shit together. Also the restaurant has become quite shabby over the last 4-5 years, tables are about to break, and are covered this disgusting sticky Grime. Bathrooms where extremely filthy. Urine all over the place. The restaurant just smells filthy as soon you walk in. We had asked to speak with a manager before we paid our bill we waited 15-20 minutes no manager arrived we just left after paying our bill.
