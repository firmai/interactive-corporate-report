10,Nichole S.,"Douglas, WY",0,30,2.0,4.0,2012-06-16,This past week when my son and I came for lunch we had a wonderful experience!  Very friendly hostess and knowledgable waiter.  The food was just what we wanted!  Good food & great price!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
8,Josh T.,"Casper, WY",2,6,,1.0,2013-07-04,"We have been here for 45 minutes at present. At about 30 minutes, our friendly server came to tell us that they were out of fish and chips which three of us ordered. We found something else and ordered, ensuring they would put our order in first and right away. 15 minutes later the food wasn't here. The manager paid for our meal and offered dessert explaining he had staff walk out and no one tell him and apologized profusely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
9,Dawn F.,"Riverton, WY",0,25,20.0,2.0,2013-07-31,"Mediocre at best. Server was sweet--but some staff was yelling out orders to servers from the kitchen--VERY RUDE and tacky. I ordered a two combo of the new specials--a 4 oz sirloin and the second was a chicken pasta. The steak was cooked right but very salty. There was a weird thick sundried tomatoe paste thrown on top of the potatoes. The pasta was basically rubber with a bunch if oil and pesto--not well mixed in. The chicken, tomatoe, mushroom and artichoke were good but put on in a way that made you miss them at first (except the chicken on top.) just a very disappointing meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
6,Bob M.,"Milton, WA",102,415,189.0,3.0,2014-04-21,"Happy hour at 10 pm cheap eats Coffee lots of coffee, and they give you a good meal for your dinning dollar, but I do like the fact they offer great break in happy our food, and its nice lite meal if you missed dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
7,Kathy N.,"Cedar, MN",0,2,,1.0,2015-03-06,"Very disappointing. Food was good, that's something I can usually count on at Applebee's. Things got bad when we placed and received our orders. There were only 4 of us. They were out of Angry Orchard beer. I ordered a whisky water. I received a shot and no water. Food came out in timely manner. The baked potatoe came loaded with everything. I only wanted butter. I asked for a replacement potato with butter only. I got one with sour cream! The bill came and we were charged for bacon bits, sour cream, cheese and onions, all things on the loaded potato that I didn't want. The waitress really didn't care. No apology just a comment of ""oh"".  While we waited, we watched service around us. 3 other tables had similar food mix ups. The waitresses (yes, mite than one of them) made numerous trips to the kitchen returning food.  This would cause me to believe that several other people may have had similar experiences.  This is on my list of places not to return to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
4,Joleen G.,"Casper, WY",0,23,,1.0,2015-04-10,"The most I think it could get for Applebee's is  3 stars when their recipes are done perfectly. They are NOT here. Our waitress was good, but the fact that it was all cooked from frozen in a microwave was all too obvious. I could heat up leftovers at home better. The one in cheyenne is what I expect a corporate neighborhood grill to be. The Casper locations management is clearly not doing it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
5,Carolynn W.,"Jackson, WY",0,36,,1.0,2016-10-22,"I was seated right away but sat for at least 20 minutes for a waitress to even come to my table. I ordered a marg and sat another 10 minutes before the waitress came back and said it was ""gonna BE awhile"" before my drink was done!?? She took my food order, left, and then I left still no drink after 1/2 hour! Never even brought WATER... Now I remember why I stopped going to Applebee's!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
3,Rob F.,"Torrington, WY",16,4,,1.0,2017-02-25,Piss on you for closing down your restaurant to one wrestling team!!!  I will never come back to your lousy establishment!!!  Thank you Sanford's for the fine dining and accommodating all the other teams that wrestled so hard this weekend!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
2,Wendy D.,"Evansville, WY",38,84,,4.0,2017-10-15,"The service at the Bar is always outstanding.  Thank you Peyton, Sarah, Callie and Lauren for your great svc.  If you have a problem they quickly correct it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
0,Michael G.,"Casper, WY",0,28,,3.0,2017-11-03,"For starters, they were very understaffed and after being seated we had to wait over 10 minutes to be served. I don't think the nice gentleman that finally waited on us was even on the clock when we were seated.  On the positive side when were finally waited on we ended up with a very friendly gentlemen. I wish I could remember his name, as he did a great job at making sure we were very happy.    Also, our meal was very good. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. My chicken breast was very juicy, tender, and flavorful. My mom's fish and chips (Sweet Potatoe Fries) were nicely cooked (not greasy at all).  In all our experience was good once we were actually waited on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
1,Karynda S.,"Franklin Park, IL",21,4,,1.0,2017-12-21,"This place is usually bad but thought we would try it. NOPE! Food came out under cooked! It was gross, and i sent mine back. Manager just said he would take care of it with no apology. Our server didn't come back. Thank goodness for Adam fur helping us when the manager and server were both incompetent! Then the manager fought with me!! This was the worst experience ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-6,,,,,
