Jon K.,"Bellevue, WA",6,110,77,5.0,9/19/2009,"The restaurant hasn't been good in a long time.  People knew since only the bar was busy.  Yesterday, it's officially out of business.  All locations in Washington have been closed. I guess that it's a good thing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Steve W.,"Kirkland, WA",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2017,"There website sucks as much as there service and food, my brothers dog wouldn't even eat the greasy  pile out of the ""doggy bag"" and he eats cat shit out of the litter box. Save your cash and digestive system and go to any other restaurant. The Kirkland location closed years ago and I was stupid enough to try this garbage dump while in SoCal last week. Food sucked service was worse and it cost as much as someplace that actually cooks food instead of reheating slop in a microwave. Shitty food shitty people stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Chris L.,"Redmond, WA",18,10,,1.0,1/30/2014,"I remember coming here years ago with a buddy to celebrate something, we were seated and promptly ignored for the rest of our time there.  We let the manager know our experience and she tried to make up for it with some free appetizer coupons.  Passed on the coupons, just asked for better service next time.  Unfortunately, our very experienced waiter of 13 years walked by and uttered an obscenity under his breath quite loudly. We weren't even given a chance to try their crappy food. Good riddance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,2.0,12/8/2008,"We tried Bellevue Square last night but it was a complete mob scene so on the recommendation of someone else, we headed for Purple in Kirkland. Which is closed on Sunday. So we ended up at Friday's. WTF is up with the stupid layout of the front doors? BAD SIGN! If you hold the door open for your friend, you have to shut the door to let yourself in because of incredibly stupid pillar placement. Not friendly from the get-go. We were seated immediately and our server was friendly, though he lost some points for calling us ""girls"" about five times... we're both over 30, thank you very much, and your pimples put you in your mid-20s. Show some respect. Sodas were brought quickly albeit in plastic 'glasses'.  There's too much to choose from on the menu. I've moved over to the Gordon Ramsay school of thought on this issue... a huge menu means that everything is brought in frozen and most of it will be crap. I'd rather have a short, all-fresh-made menu of things to choose from, or a menu with lots of choices that are variations on a theme (a la Red Robin, where the burgers are good even though there are many to choose from, because the basic ingredients are all fresh).  We ordered burgers which were made correctly to our order but were still just so-so. The sweet potato fries were better than the regular ones. The white potato fries seemed to get cold immediately; I didn't notice if they came to the table boiling hot, but my guess is that they did not. Come on! That is SO basic!! The music and the TVs were a little loud for the number of people in the place. The restrooms were ample and clean. That's a nice change, especially at a restaurant of this type and age.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Ryan Q.,"Yakima, WA",33,65,3,2.0,9/11/2008,"To be quite honest, i've never really been impressed with this place.  The chicken has almost always been dry, takes forever to get the food, and more often than not,  i'm left to just sit there, glass empty, and no one to help me I've had a few good times here, but the majority of the time, I sit there telling myself ""haha, I told you not to come here""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Bernadette E.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,330,36,3.0,3/13/2008,"Being from southern California TGI Fridays was anywhere and everywhere I went! So when my boyfriend, who's a HUGE fan of this place, asks me where the closest Friday's was I had to stop and think. So I thought... And thought... And thought some more... Come to find out the closest one to me is in Kirkland... what??? REALLY??? Not a big deal for me but a little heart breaking for the boy... So low and behold we make time to make a visit so that he can enjoy a long island iced tea, one his favorites. The layout is just like all the others and although the menu style and a few items have changed a bit everything else was still the same... thank goodness for the boy's sake!! If you live out here it's a great place to stop in for a quick drink or bite on the way home from work, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for any other reason... simply because there are so many other great places to eat in the general area. Enjoyed a few drinks, ate some food, watched some baseball (my fave sport) and enjoyed some quality time with my man... thank you Friday's for making Tommy's night!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Henry A.,"Bothell, WA",6,34,159,1.0,3/14/2009,Definitely not a place for vegetarians.  I mean you can have a salad but they have to take the meat off of every single one.  Not a single Vegetarian meal.  So were ordered a salmon dish - minus the salmon.  Decent meal but then we were charged full price.  WTF! On top of that I had a fruitfly landed in my beer. Not going back to this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
jeff m.,"Seattle, WA",3,15,,5.0,6/5/2007,"Nice decour. Vibrant and colorful wait staff. Diverse menu. Killer desserts. If you want a burger, but your fiance wants spagetti, and you're going out to eat with people who only eat stir fry or steak, this is the place to go. Unlimited choice! If you're in a hurry, you can even call ahead and get your food prepared to go.  I declare this restaurant to be the jewel of the American dining exprience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Charles C.,"Seattle, WA",60,171,6,1.0,3/9/2009,"I know what you're thinking, what the heck were you doing at this crappy chain in the first place. Well don't worry it won't happen again, I've learned my lesson. This place sucks from the moment you try to get through the ineptly designed entry way to the last dry stale overcooked item that you force down your gullet. D I S G U S T I N G ! ! !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Sarah S.,"Seattle, WA",84,218,1,1.0,11/9/2009,"Pay your taxes, TGI Fridays. We came here yesterday in search of a chain restaurant that wasn't Red Robin, only to find that they were closed and owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes. Seriously- there's a letter posted on the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Carly L.,"Redmond, WA",281,644,2,2.0,8/18/2008,"Sadly the glory days of TGIF in Kirkland are long gone. Probably long gone about 15+ years ago? I waited for my friend in the ""lobby"" and it actually kinda stunk, like what? I couldn't quite figure it out, but was glad when my friend arrived. Our service was OK, my sandwich seemed like a sad pile of chicken, veggies, and bread... put together with little excitement. The people working didn't seem to give a rats ass about the place, and I noticed one of the guys texting on his cell phone while walking in between two tables he was waiting on. Seems like TGIF's needs to be put out of their misery. *Side note: My roomie came here one night and sat at the bar, with her purse on the bar stool. Said purse was stolen. So be careful if you sit at bar. *Second side note: do yourself a favor and go downstairs in Park Place to Rikki Rikki. It's been there a long time, yet you don't feel like you are in a sad time warp once you arrive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Flavius G.,"Bothell, WA",1,33,,5.0,10/9/2009,"They had terrific food for the money!  I was shocked to find it shut down yesterday, with my free burger coupon in hand.  I'm sure all your negative reviews here didn't help.  I don't understand the vitriol. The food was as good as any other TGI Friday's, the service was just fine. Thanks a lot reviewers and bad economy for limiting my choices in affordable, nice places to eat.  I'm tired of Applebees, Olive Garden, Outback... I want the good chains available in other parts of the country to come here, like:  Pizzeria Uno, Chilis, Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse, and yes, TGI Fridays!  If you say, I shouldn't eat at chain restaurants, fine, then give me some equally affordable and delicious alternatives!  I haven't found very many except some Greek places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
A W.,"Seattle, WA",0,52,,1.0,7/11/2008,"Don't ever go here.  Service was very poor.  The food wasn't just bad... it was nasty.   I ordered one of their 'favorites' on the menu, some All-American burger.  The bread looked like it was retoasted, it was a little soggy.  The cheese wasn't fully melted.  My food wasn't even hot, it was warm...  It was so gross.   I'm never setting foot in a TGI Fridays again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
jane t.,"Austin, TX",24,61,,1.0,12/14/2007,"If you don't fancy a premature death surrounded by breadsticks and endless iceberg lettuce soaked in sugary dressing (Olive Garden, Kirkland), then TGIF is a good alternative location. When asked what soup was good, our server said ""Well people seem to finish the tomato basil one the most"". Sadly I didn't listen to his wise words and had the white bean and chicken chili - imagine cat vomit with some cheddar sprinkled on top - but microwaved on too high a setting, so the edges are solid. I think bits of it are still in my digestive tract somewhere and I ate it two weeks ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Glenn S.,"Bellevue, WA",353,283,247,5.0,5/27/2008,"Service is always great! The bar staff is the best, they will always go above and beyond to make sure you are happy and always leave safe! Also, the food is always well prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Britney B.,"Everett, WA",30,22,,1.0,3/19/2008,"we were tired..it was late..and we were on the eastside..ON a weeknight....what to do? you know it's a bad sign when you ask the waitress what she eats and her answer is ""uh, i actually don't eat here"" CHECK PLEASE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Brndn N.,"San Diego, CA",407,69,,3.0,2/8/2006,"This was one of my favorite places to go during highschool, but the appeal has worn off. Their signature style is playful and irreverent but there comes to a point in someone's life when fake signs, bicycle parts, and canoes all sticking out of the ceiling just seems a bit overplayed. The burgers are great, but the tastelessly done ""Americanisms"" (larger than life portions, the Atkin's menue, etc.) turn me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Anne T.,"Kirkland, WA",0,7,,1.0,4/26/2008,"This was the absolute worst food I've ever had.  I ordered the french onion soup, which came cold (not tepid, cold).  I then asked for a different soup, the clam chowder.  It was absolutely nasty, imagine Mrs. Lovett from Sweeney Todd making your chowder, I'm pretty sure there were no clams in there, some bad textured, mushy mystery meat.  It was sick.  I felt ill after leaving.  My man's hamburger was edible, he said, but about the same quality you'd get at McDonalds, where I'm sad to say, you'd be better off going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
Matt E.,"Kirkland, WA",1,29,,3.0,7/21/2008,If you want to eat here you NEED to sit at the bar and only go from Wed. - Saturday nights.  The bar staff those days is phenominal.  Happy Hour is one of the best I've been to.  Don't sit in the general area.  Poor service and for some reason a different quality of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kirkland
