79,Yvonne B.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,104,14.0,4.0,2012-01-23,"Between 2008-now I have probably eaten at this CPK approximately 30 times. This seems like a lot, but when I worked in International Plaza it was at Adrenalina - which was right across the hall. In that time, I've tried almost every pizza they have and most of their pastas...and there all really good. My two favorite items are their white pizza and their macaroni and cheese. While CPK might not be a place that is super adventurous, what they do they do well and their pizzas are unique and delicious. The service is what took them from three to four stars. I can't speak for any location other than this one at International Plaza, but they are all GREAT! They get to know you, joke with you, and are super friendly. Within the last couple of months they started their small plate items...YUM! Crispy Mac-n-Cheese and the focaccia sticks are heaven. Pair those with their dangerously drinkable Caribbean sangria and it makes the perfect lunch! All in all, I recommend giving CPK a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=60,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

They have an excellent selection of salads, one for every taste profile. My two favorite are the Thai Crunch (add avocado) and the Roasted Veggie (add chicken).  CPK has a nicer wine selection than one would think, and the prices are great. You can get a bottle of cakebread chardonnay for $49! I usually get a glass of Clos Dus Bois Chard, where the large pour only sets me back $7. Also, the white corn guacamole is amazing.

She saw me, but did not greet me or look at my eyes saying, "" I'll be right it's you."" Instead she totally ignored me for quite a while, walked away, some of that time spent talking to a co- worker over the bar. I felt invisible and unappreciated. I almost walked out. i think it's bad form to not make the customer feel important by giving them outstanding service as quickly as possible. At a minimum, acknowledge me and make it obvious you're trying your best to get to me as soon as possible. Finally she came over and in an insincere tone and matching expression asked could she help me. I ordered my salad , Cobb, and an order of spinach artichoke dip- super yummy!

The food was expensivooooo but pretty good. We go there in the late afternoon- by the time we left, place was PACKED with kids running around and smashing things. Not my scene at the moment, but I feel very welcomed here if I had kids of my own. Side note, the booth I sat in was ripped and the bathroom floor was falling apart.

78,Paul V.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",11,33,,3.0,2013-08-17,"California Pizza Kitchen is one of those restaurants that I don't really eat at unless there's some sort of work lunch going on there. In this case, it was a co-worker's birthday. We visited on a Friday afternoon, and the place was packed. As a result our server was on the brusque side: he had a tendency to kind of plop multiple orders on the table and let us figure out where they went. He did get us in and out of the restaurant on time, though. I ordered their ""classic"" garlic chicken pizza, which is apparently a signature item of theirs. The crust was nice, but a little underdone, topped with cheese, grilled chicken, grated scallions, and a generous amount of roasted garlic. No sauce, which struck me as a little strange, but I enjoyed it anyway. My server suggested that the pizza was intended for one person, but I don't recommend eating an entire one by yourself. Split it if possible. My co-workers ordered various salads, and everybody seemed pretty happy with what they got. They've got one of the fancy Coca-Cola machines with all of the various syrups and flavorings, which is nice if you're like me and you miss Coke with Lime. Somebody else compared California Pizza Kitchen to the Cheesecake Factory, and I think that's an apt comparison. Perfectly fine for a chain, and not a bad place to grab lunch, though a tad overpriced for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=60,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.436,3.2400000000000007

I took half home and and it didn't reheat well.  My son had an odd mix of pulled pork and pesto.  Not worth trying again. My husband's meat lover's pizza went over better with him but it ran right through him.  Not the healthiest thing he could have chosen.   If I ever get back to this restaurant, I'll probably choose a pasta plate or sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.3680000000000003,3.2000000000000006
33,Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020.0,4.0,2013-10-09,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was founded in Beverly Hills, CA in the mid 1980's to provide a casual-dining restaurant with a healthy California twist on hearth-baked pizzas, salads, pastas, entrees, soups, and salads. This CPK can be found inside International Plaza on the lower level near Nordstrom, just at the bottom of the escalators to the second floor, and it's the perfect place to stop if you're looking for a quick meal while still enjoying the air conditioning in the mall. We stopped in for dinner after a productive day of shopping, and started by sharing one of their new shaved mushroom and spinach flatbreads which was shavings of Cremini mushrooms, chopped sautéed spinach, and California olive oil sprinkled with Romano and Parmesan cheeses and served on toasted flatbread. With that I ordered a cup of the Sedona Tortilla soup which was vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos and corn with mild green chilies and Southwestern spices. Garnished with tortilla strips. Nice, and plenty spicy! I also had the Thai Crunch salad which had crisp veggies and cilantro with grilled and cubed chicken, avocado, and the crunch of peanuts, wontons and rice sticks. That was served with their Thai peanut dressing. I've had several of their different pizzas, pastas and sandwiches over the years, but seem to be drawn to the unique flavors of their many different dinner-sized salads. Many are geared for vegetarians, but you can add chicken, shrimp or salmon to your liking. It's a bit pricey, but nothing outrageous for this part of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.632,3.3200000000000003

The main bar area now faces windows overlooking the mall (for improved people watching). Hopefully this redesign will make its way to other CPKs since the kitchen-facing bars are usually dead.  The menu now includes halibut. Don't expect a sophisticated and perfectly-executed dish like the cedar plank salmon. The halibut sits on a bed of farro soaked in salty, fatty goo. It's a large portion of unremarkable food that gets less appetizing the more you slog through it. The best thing about it is the asparagus, which CPK generally gets right (almost unheard of in a restaurant of this class).

Mirac was probably the best server that we've had in a very long time.

49,Pranam P.,"Tampa, FL",239,106,74.0,4.0,2015-05-09,"Oh CPK, you never cease to make me and my tummy happy (we are two different people).  I have personally been to this location a couple times and have pretty much found out what is pretty good, and also what's not so hot. If you are worried about how busy it is, it's in a very busy mall with some hungry people...so expect to wait a little bit. They have a bar now, so that should keep you company until you get a seat! When you get your table, to start off you would probably want to order pizza since it is California PIZZA kitchen, I mean no spoilers here. They have options for EVERYONE (food allergies, veggie heads, carnivores, etc)! I have personally tried 4 of the original hand-tossed pizzas which include the five cheese + fresh tomato, mushroom pepperoni sausage, the original bbq chicken, and the works. They are fantastic! The only thing I would complain about are the prices for the portion size, but you really are just paying for the taste. Each of these pies has a unique seasoning blend that encompasses the sauce, crust, and ingredients, so you really do get immersed in the pizza. I take my pizza very seriously. After you get pizza, you should try the chicken tequila fettuccine! ITS THE BEST PASTA DISH I'VE EVER HAD! I swear by the pasta gods, that this is incredible. You get a big portion size, so you will be happy now, going home, and when you get home because you will be snacking all night long.  So I've named all of the good things, let's start with the not so good things. Didn't really enjoy the spicy chicken tinga quesadilla, they were tasty, but very dry so you had to drown it in the ranchito sauce... however, the ranchito sauce was a bit rancido tasting if you catch my drift. I have also tried 2 of the crispy thin crust options which were tasty on the top, but was pretty much burnt all the way through and was rock hard. I would say give it a go because I had both of them on the same day. Also some of the staff members are not very nice. One of the waiters's names is Marec? Marek? I am not sure how to spell it, but he is wonderful, so I would suggest asking if he is there! Overall, lots to try!

It seemed most people were dining across the mall at the other end but I was looking for something a little low key. Ventured the other way and found California Pizza Kitchen and the bar was wide open.  The minute I sat down the bartender cleaned around my area, but not my area so I had to ask him to clean the area I sat in. Then I asked if he had recommendation for a local beer, but he didn't. I ended up ordering a brew I had never tried. I could feel my experience already starting to go downhill. Next it was time to place my order. I decided on a wedge salad and Bianco flatbread suggested by bartender. Definitely recommend the flatbread. It was thin crust with just the right amount of cheese, sage and truffle. I also ordered a wedge salad, it was TERRIBLE! Drenched in blue cheese dressing and had no flavor. Disappointed that my salad and flatbread came out at the same time. I would have preferred to try to enjoy my over dresses salad first and then try to eat my flatbread.  CPK is a chain and I have had good experiences at many of them.

97,Mimi B.,"Reston, VA",0,38,,2.0,2016-01-27,"I ordered the 1/2 grilled veggie ciabatta and salad combo for lunch for a total $9.95 plus tax. I ordered the sesame ciabatta instead of the parmesan bread.  The sandwich included a huge piece of white bread in the form of a crusty dinner roll, not so much the traditional ciabatta. Inside was a sliver of grilled green pepper and mushrooms, but mainly lettuce with a tiny slice of tomato and a piece of sun-dried tomato. Comparing it to other grilled veggie sandwiches which I've ordered at other restaurants, it was skimpy and more like a salad sandwich than grilled veggies, but mainly white bread. If you like to eat a lot of starch and simple carbohydrate for lunch, then it would be great pick.  I ordered the companion Mediterranean salad without the feta cheese. For the price of the lunch, although the salad was fresh and delicious, it was very small, and in my opinion the meal was not worth the price. My lunch guests were of the same opinion that the meal was skimpy and left one wanting more. They both ordered the soup and salad combo. The soups were delicious, but the salad was tiny. We all went away feeling like we needed something more substantial for lunch. Had we filled up on the refined,white (Italian) bread full of carbohydrates that was served before our meal, then we would have gone away full and fatter.

My wife and I were ecstatic to find one here, and immediately decided on celebrating Valentine's Day here.  We lucked into a Valentine's special which was 2 for $32. We got an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip), two pizzas which I snapped pictures of (halfway through eating them, sorry), and a dessert of our choice. We chose the butter cake which was fantastic. The food was as good as I could've asked it to be. CPK at its best. Our waiter Michael was awesome! Cheery, attentive, and understanding.  The only reason I can't give this a 5 star review is due to the hostess. She asked us if we wanted a table or a booth, and added that the booth was in the back. We didn't oppose and chose the booth. What she failed to mention was that the booth was literally right next to the bathroom door. It smelled terrible as people opened and closed the bathroom doors repeatedly so we asked to move to an outside table. Once we sat down outside I quickly began to smell trash. Low and behold, the outside seating is relatively close to the dumpster. We just accepted it at that point and enjoyed our time.  I know there isn't much they can do about the seating arrangement, but this was a bit ridiculous to seat customers in front of the bathroom and then by a dumpster (with a small white wall roughly 5ft high being the only thing between the table and trash).

They additional toppings were chicken, arugula, fresh tomato, avo and lettuce. I could've done without the lettuce, it's a weird ingredient to have on a pizza and made it feel quite heavy. I do understand that they were going for a salad/pizza vibe but it just didn't cut it for me. The pizzas were also quite small compared to other pizza restaurants vs price. They offer a whole grain base option and thin crust pizza's which I've noticed is very rare in the US.  The restaurant was busy and the service was great! I would like to go again to try out a few other pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=20,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.628,3.88

The corn appetizer was only 2 tablespoonful- barely enough for one- and not as tasty as usual. Maybe a different recipe?  The chicken on my cobb salad was usually cut in chunks and gently grilled. This time the chicken was unappetizing as it was thinly sliced, and appeared to have condensation on it.  Ill definitely give this restaurant another try... and will order something different.  The staff are helpful and pleasant.

13,Mary J.,"Tampa, FL",223,347,720.0,4.0,2016-12-04,"Going anywhere near a shopping mall in December to dine on a Saturday night was not my first choice. But my dining companion is a fan of this place and I was ready to give it a try.  Fortunately heading there around 7 p.m. was a breeze with little in the way of traffic. Parking in the lot closest to this restaurant was plentiful so I was thinking, so far, so good. Then I saw the wait list. Now this is a fairly spacious restaurant and the turnover rate seemed to be moving folks in and out at a good clip. But seeing the names already listed gave me pause.  I added my name for what was estimated to be about a 10-minute wait and hoped for the best. By the time the second member of my part of two arrived, I was already seated. Off to a promising start. It was not long before a server swooped by and took drink orders. And almost as quickly he was back, first with bread and olive oil for dipping and then the drinks.  Our table for two was comfortably located alongside another dining duo on one side and a family of four on the other. But the sound level was pleasantly low enough to easily allow for conversation even though the place was packed. When the food arrived in a very timely manner (the kitchen is quick even when it is swamped), drinks were re-addressed by the server and the eating enjoyment began.  I had checked out the menu online before arriving and was impressed with the variety of dishes offered here. There are certainly pizzas but so much more and everything sounded appealing. Oddly there were no prices posted on the online menu or the menu on display at the entrance to the restaurant but, fortunately, food here is reasonably priced. There seemed to be a point person circulating the floor throughout the evening monitoring and checking in with guests. Probably a big part of the reason things seemed to move so smoothly. I had to pass on dessert even though my friend, who knows firsthand, really recommended the Butter Cake. Fortunately this seems to be the sort of in-demand restaurant that will remain here for a while. And that means more opportunities to go back and enjoy its quality service, tasty food and tempting Butter Cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.7920000000000003,3.84

When I ate here I realized how long it's been since I've eaten at a CPK. I used to absolutely love it! First of all, I sat at the bar on a Thursday evening and it was pretty empty. The bartender was attentive and very helpful. She was also very friendly. I wish I knew her name so I could shout her out, but I'm terrible with names. I ordered a Bianco Flatbread and I loved it. Mainly because you can't go wrong with truffles on anything ever. Also, it was a legit flatbread in that it was crisp without tasting like a cracker. I also ordered the Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. It was good, but I wish I asked them to put the dressing on the side as there was a lot on it. Normally that's a good thing but I was trying to keep things tight and didn't want to derail off creamy salad dressing.

The best part of this place has to be the pizza obviously. They have many choices for the pizza. My favorite choice is to do half-and-half that way you can try little bit of everything. The barbecue has to be the most delicious pizza I have ever had. The only thing that would make this place even better is if they had calzones.

We ordered the veggie spring rolls as an appetizer which was in lieu of the buffalo cauliflower as it wasn't available initially. Would recommend these. We then shared a mushroom pizza. The pizzas are a good size for 2 people to share as long as you're not overly hungry. Server then later told us that buffalo cauliflower was now available. Since my boyfriend and I are vegetarians and have loved buffalo cauliflower at other places, we were excited to try theirs which is made with a sriracha sauce. Very good quality and presentation but  only 4 pieces so that was unsatisfying and left the dinner on a bad note.

Their pizza is nothing to write home about either, especially not compared to a plethora of independent, local pizza restaurants you could support instead. I've been to this location a couple times, and service is a little slow, mostly the kitchen. My waiters have never been rude. Quite the opposite. But, to be fair to all restaurants, I judge them by how often my water glass is empty. And it's empty a lot here. That being said, I sat at the bar last time and enjoyed my experience. The bartender was friendly and didn't judge me when I told her I was just there to drink. I ordered the sangria flight, and it was decent. I wouldn't go back specifically for it, but it was a nice way to relax while I was waiting for a friend.

1,Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1336,992,1507.0,4.0,2017-11-27,"Solid, unassuming food that appeals to almost everyone. (Review of lunch) There is definitely a cult following for CPK. My friend arranged a lunch with three of her other friends, who I had never met before, and their children (at our table of four adults we had two toddlers, a five-year-old, and a ten-year-old.) Upon sitting everyone whipped out their phones to open their CPK app. There's a rewards program. One of them explained to me that if you don't eat here that often you really don't need the app, but they eat there almost every week.  I've gleaned a couple reasons why people love CPK so much. 1. It has mid range pricing. You can spend $10 on lunch or upwards of $20 depending on what you order.  2. The food appeals to almost everyone. Since I'm eating healthy there were tons of salad options for me. The kids were able to grab pizza, pasta, and chicken nuggets. Another friend opted for a pizza and another went with salmon. Literally something for almost everyone.  3. It's clean, open, and inviting. The space is one giant dining room and the clientele are mostly moms with their kids or people looking like they are going to a fitness studio (a class above your standard gym). If CPK was a student at your high school, it would be the squeaky clean popular kid that doesn't offend anyone.  I got the California Field Salad, which I think is seasonal. It comes with strawberries, pistachios, and watermelon. The half size is more than enough. It was a solid salad (I mean, I'm at CPK, just from the description above would you expect anything else?) I think CPK knows its target audience well and caters to them.
