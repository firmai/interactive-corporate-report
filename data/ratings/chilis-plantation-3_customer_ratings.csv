10,Andre W.,"Chicago, IL",419,1624,226.0,4.0,2013-04-14,Stopped in with my colleague as we were hungry after our client meeting.  We grabbed a seat in the bar area at a high top. We were given some chips & salsa which my colleague was surprised as he is a frequent Chilli's visitor and he never gets chips & salsa. Maybe it happened because I was there...lol. Service was great and I ordered some tilapia special they were having for $10.

Smoke was billowing up in a motherfucking cloud from the serving skillet and was filling the seating area. And, she really, truly said, ""It smells awful and burnt but it's not! I think we just added too much sauce!"" So you're saying your sauce is supposed to smell like burned onions? I'm not sure what you mean. Is that a trademark flavor of Chili's? Burned food? Anyway, the veg was halfway black from the bottom, the meat was overcooked and tasted of burnt veg and she says, ""Well, we can replace the vegetables and keep the meat since it's not burned!"" Yeah, fuck the customer. Because Chili's can't afford to toss half a chicken breast and 4 shrimp. Anyway, I asked whether the bar had Drambuie.

I've never met someone who truly seems like they love their job the way she does. And if she doesn't then this woman needs an Emmy. Every time I go there I'm greeted by this woman who treats her customers like they are family. It's amazing. You know, another thing I love? BOGO drinks. The adult kind. Any place that gives me a margarita for free after I order one AND it tastes great. Major points in my book. The service is always good; having polite and attentive waitstaff. I never find myself having an issue with anything. The food arrives quickly and always how I wanted it to be. The food itself is standard Chili's grub. If that's what you want, then you'll be pleased. The endless chips and salsa are my favorite as is the guacamole burger.

I would definitely reccommend them.  The overall look and feel of the restaurant is casual and on my visits, it has always been clean, which I appreciate.  They added a little tablet-like device which allows you to reorder drinks and pay your bill all at the table which is great. Not paying together? You can split the bill.

This was electric energy! We found a place to sit and commence our fun too. It is 2 for 1 Happy Hour all the time we are told and they have Kiosks on the tables like many other restaurants.  If you sit in the bar chips & salsa are Always Free if you just ask! We actually abstained! I know right!! Appetizers are 1/2 price. We wanted to try their enchiladas. No judging please! This is S FL and pretty much Mexican food is non- existence, so why Not! Well let me tell you we pleasantly Surprised! Bottomless Enchiladas choices to begin are chicken with cream sauce or green chile verde. Ground beef w a red sauce. We both chose chicken and cream sauce and the verde! White meat chicken breast seasoned deliciously rolled in corn tortillas with cheese and covered in the sauces with cilantro rice and choice of beans. Bean choices; pinto or black. We both got black and these were fantastic! Tender, seasoned and made with tlc! The rice was fluffy with the delicious cilantro all stirred through. They hit the mark with this for sure! Wowzers! I remembered I had a glass of wine lol, n sipped it. Sam Adams Lager for my love. Aahh! Chili's congrats on the new items on the menu!  Our server Ashley was attentive and checked back at just the right times with a smile. The employee atmosphere was warm and cheerful.

All the Chilis looks exactly the same, and we found ourselves grabbing two stools at the bar immediately.  First things first, get the 2 for 1 drinks going.  I ordered a draft beer and I noticed that the size of the beer mug they served me is a bit larger than the Chilis near our house.  Or maybe I am imagining things but it sure feels like it.  And my wife ordered her usual Long Island Ice Tea.  She felt it wasted a little bit different than she used to, but said the second drink was a bit strong. For lunch, we ordered a few different appetizer items.  Started off our favorite Southwest Egg Rolls.  The dish came warm and crispy.  We only got Big Mouth Bites instead of three we get at the other place, which seemed odd.  We also got some onion rings and an order of Classic Nachos.   In this visit, All the  food tasted fine.  Our bartender was pretty good and provided excellent service.  The only thing we were not thrill about is their table top tablet.  We paid our bills through it but then we noticed it automatically charged us $1.99 ""entertainment"" fee.  It took a lot of hassle to get that taken out of our tab.  So be careful and always check your bill, even if it's $1.99.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

When we arrived, the hostess asked if we'd like to sit in the bar area because they had free chips and salsa. We asked if we could have a booth and were told to sit wherever we wanted.  Except, there were no clean booths. In fact, the tables were all dirty. So was the floor. After a long wait, a waitress finally came asked if we wanted chips and salsa and took our drink order. After another long wait, chips and salsa along with our drinks arrived.  We had to ask for plates, something I would assume would be a no brainier. Our order was taken and the food came out without incident. Nothing special, but exactly what I would expect from a chain such as this. During our meal, there was an incident at the front door. Two young women were having an argument with an employee about which I have no idea.  One of the women was getting in the employee's face and talking trash. It was quite a scene.  And it was loud. Other employees starting coming out of the kitchen and from other areas of the restaurant to see what was going on. Finally a patron at the bar called the police.  They took some statements and left without any further excitement.  My wife and I waited again for quite some time before the waitress finally came over and asked me if I knew how to work the machine on the table.  This apparently is how you pay now.  I would give this experience 1/2 a star if I could based on the fact that the food was edible.

38,Tony B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",46,122,66.0,4.0,2017-04-25,"My girlfriend and I didn't feel like cooking tonight so we decided to stop in at Chili's. Cara was our server and she did a good job. She was attentive and helpful. The food was what you would expect from a Chili's. Most of the appetizers are fried foods however, I did enjoy the Southwestern egg rolls. I had the bacon avocado sandwich and found it to be good. If you've been to a Chili's you're likely familiar with the experience. Only real complaint is that they are utilizing a hand held device at the table for pretty everything your waitress typically does. Not a huge fan of that, but if you're into it then Chili's will suit you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
29,Kim C.,"Sunrise, FL",635,614,1824.0,4.0,2017-08-11,"I always have a good experience here with food, drinks, and service. I wasn't really a fan of Chili's in general but lately I've been seeing myself come here more often. It's your typical standard Chili's with a large parking lot. This is located in the busy plaza, The Fountains. I love their drink specials, they offer two for one prices on certain drinks (wine, beer, cocktails). I really like their Thursday deal, $5 Presidente margarita. The margarita was so delicious and the drink yields about three glasses (it comes in a shaker). I also really like their chile-lime chicken and rice entree; that is so flavorful with a nice kick to it, it's also on the healthier side. The bar area is usually packed so we always opt for a booth. Our server was always checking up on us and making sure our drinks were filled.  This is definitely my go-to Chili's because it's in a convenient location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
41,Dawn W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,2.0,2017-09-23,"Took my son here for his 10th birthday dinner.  Our waitress Maria took our orders without even looking at any of us or smiling.  She put the food on the table and left still without saying anything or making eye contact.   Still not one smile.   It was obvious my sons food had been microwaved to the point that it all stuck together and was hard.  I ordered a buffalo chicken salad and for  some reason it was too salty to eat.  I don't even know how you make a salad salty.  The waitress never came back to check on us.  Finally she saw my full plate at the end of the table and asked if I wanted it to go.  My son was still eating when she started to remove the plates from the table.  The manager came over and was incredibly nice, he removed my salad from the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
31,Afa I.,"Plantation, FL",449,90,1596.0,3.0,2017-10-10,"Not a bad place for lunch. The location never gets too crowded. We go here for lunch with my co-workers, so we know the servers and they know us. Be sure to ask for customization, to replace your stale chips, and ask for extra service if you are picky when it comes to service, they will work with you. The manager will gladly come out to address your concerns. I actually like Chilli's menu and choices. It gives you enough options, for any taste. Dont expect above and beyond from anyone at this location, this is perhaps due to their internal culture at the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
37,Splarticus B.,"South Corals, Oakland Park, FL",0,1,,5.0,2017-10-11,Sat at the bar this past weekend and had so much fun. Glenn was the bartender and was totally awesome. He recommended a Presidents Margarita with black cherries. It was to die for. There were lots of customers that seemed to know each other. I was told by one guy he comes here every week and gets something new made by Glen each time. I ate eggrolls and they were pretty good. Glen made  me try the spicy Santa Fe sauce. He called it Santa Clause sauce so that I would remember the name.... hilarious. The manager walked by and was asking people if everything was ok. I thought that was cool. I will definitely come back and sit at the bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

32,Paula R.,"Clearwater, FL",215,19,51.0,3.0,2017-12-08,"I was a little upset because Chili's recently changed their menu and got rid of my favorite dish...the margarita chicken bowl (I get it without chicken to make it plantbased) but they didn't have it. The waitress though was helpful and suggested the chipotle chicken bowl without the chicken and it was good but was too spicy for my taste (I don't really like spicy). The side salad was very good with the balsamic vinaigrette on top! Suggestion to Chili's: update the allergen menu that's on the kiosk, it's very helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
