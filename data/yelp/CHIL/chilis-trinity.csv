Richard C.,"New Port Richey, FL",1,26,12,3.0,10/28/2017,"We ordered fajitas...not as good as last time we5were in.  Steak had a different marinade, onions6could have cooked longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Hli H.,"Sarasota, FL",14,46,16,4.0,9/22/2017,This is a more modern/renovated location. The food here has been pretty good-fresh and hot. The wait staff is friendly enough and food promptness is fairly decent. The location is on the northwest corner of Mitchell Ranch plaza with decent amount of parking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Christopher S.,"Dunedin, FL",219,518,840,3.0,4/17/2017,"Firstly, the hostess and assistant appeared to be clueless! They called for a party of 7, went outside in the foyer to call for them, until we told them this party might be in the bar area. Guess what? Then they couldn't find a party of two. They called the names in the restaurant then shouted to the closed door leading to the foyer! WTH? As for the food, we split the Big Mouth Bites (chili version of slider, 4=1640) and Fried Pickles (670 cals) which were forgettable as the market screams them these days. Ordinary mini buns and less that quality ground beef will not reach the bar. I looked around the table and all I could think of was ""bar food gone bad!"" I could still have a skinny Margarita and a decent chicken breast with a side of veggies and walk away guilt free. When I looked at the new menu and it listed calories on most dishes. Most listed 4 figures! I take 1500 calories a day and can get totally satisfied! Guacamole with tostada chips & salsa cash in at 1150 cals! These is a Lighter Choices selection of 7 dishes under 610 cals Yeah, I need to stay focused in that area from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Shalei M.,"Holiday, FL",9,87,78,5.0,1/30/2017,"Place was clean.  Kinda loud music but it was OK.  Waitress was quick and attentive.  Food came out so quickly and the appetizer was a meal in itself.  We ordered the sample platter, boneless chicken bites, mini sliders, cheese curds and different dips.  My meal was unlimited salad and soup.  The chicken enchilada soup was so cheesy with tender chicken and sprinkles of tortilla chips.  It came with fresh tortilla chips and there fantastic salsa.  Our son had the macaroni and cheese with a side of fries.  Husband had the ribeye with corn on the cob and fries.  By the time we got our dinner we were so stuffed.  We tried bites but ended up taking 3 containers home.  Loved this location.  Bring your appetite and your bucks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Bill J.,"Holiday, FL",0,13,,5.0,11/29/2017,"This Chili's always has excellent service and food. Needed to get some Fajitas only to find out that Chili's is running a special on Combo Fajitas (my Favorite) for $10.99. What a bargain then on top of that 2 for 1 drafts. And Chili's isn't like the other restaurants, they don't charge double for a beer, just standard price. I will most definitely be back real soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Harlan M.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,40,,2.0,7/16/2017,"Second visit in a row where the food has been not good enough to return. FIrst visit I ordered a Ribeye which is my go to steak and quite honestly it was the worst one I have ever had. Seasoning consisted mainly of salt. Went last night and wife got black broccoli, tasteless mashed potatoes and while she liked her Sirloin, like my Ribeye it was overcooked.  Service was also an issue. The waitress was very nice but drink refills were slow and she screwed up my son's order. It was easily fixed but she did not check back with us until he was almost done with his meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Mon A.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,10,5,1.0,12/17/2017,"Ughh.... got there and ordered two drinks (LIIT $9 a piece) and both tasted like dish soap! Terrible! Server barely acknowledged us to even make him aware of the soapy drink. Manager delivered appetizers and had to quickly stop him from turning to walk away and let him know about our soapy drinks. Ended up with a lemonade in a to go cup to make sure no more soap was being consumed. Food arrived... french fries were old, chewy and cold... burger was presented in a way that you were force to eat it with a fork and knife and pretty bland and soggy. Giving it one star because my enchiladas were hot, but it ends there. When we got the check the waiter had no idea that he needed to remove the soapy LIIT and it took 4 attempts to pay the bill with they're tabletop kiosk and the waiter could not be bothered to give us a hand... no one acknowledged the situation.

Jeremy M.,"Fort Gratiot Township, MI",108,43,2,5.0,7/25/2017,Have been to several Chili's locations in the United States and this location is one of the best ones I have ever been to. The server that we had was quick on drink refills and was very attentive. Had the Chips and Salsa as an appetizer and it was very good. Had the Bacon Ranch Quesadillas as an entree and it was good really well. The cooks at this location are very experienced and knowledgeable. Had the Molten Chocolate Cake as a free dessert and it was delicious. I would recommend this Chili's location to anyone that is a resident or visitor. Would definitely come back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Stephanie W.,"New Port Richey, FL",51,7,4,1.0,1/22/2016,"Came here to get margaritas with a girlfriend. All was well, we ordered the Presidente margaritas which were great, as well as chips & salsa. My friend wanted another drink but the 2 female bartenders were avoiding us. We finally flagged down a waiter and got another round.  The experience has left a bad taste in our mouths. What does it take to get served here?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Rob T.,"New Port Richey, Tampa Bay, FL",0,44,4,1.0,3/23/2016,"First experience ever and it bombed, bad. 1hr 47minutes after we sat down, we got our check. Lovely waitress but doesn't compensate for SLOW service. Dinner for 2 special means Special long time. Even asked the hostess, who was constantly sitting at the next table through out our experience, for refill of water. Horrible experience for a first time. You wont get a second chance to ruin my date night with my wife, sorry. Wont recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Marianne C.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",143,45,119,4.0,8/1/2015,"I have been to several different Chili's locations over the years. I think this one in Trinity is the best. Somehow the atmosphere is light and roomier than others I've been to.   Also, the skinny margaritas are delicious here. We did order the tableside guacamole. But, it turned out the avocados were not ripe enough.  The other food we ordered was great as was the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Robert H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,5,,2.0,5/19/2017,My wife went there to pick up a quick meal for our child for dinner. It was one of those busy Friday's. She simply ordered the Queso and also the Triple Dipper. Amazingly there was hardly and Queso and the Triple Dipper looked like it was thrown in a box and stuck in a bag. It also tasted as though the food sat on the shelf and was all dried out. We dine here frequently because it is very close to home. It has become a hit or miss situation lately. Unfortunately I feel we need to find another place to go with a similar menu. Too bad. It was always so nice to go there. Maybe a change of Management. Highly Disappointed....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Tina S.,"Holiday, FL",33,7,7,4.0,9/28/2016,Last visit was on 8/28 and I have to say that this is a nice place for  a late lunch or a dinner date to kick the night off. Have always enjoyed the atmosphere and service at this location. Staff always have a smile ready for you as you enter. That same smile goes along great with the server who greets you and introduces themselves prior to  explaining the specials they currently have. Will continue to visit and enjoy not only the food that is visually appealing but also the staff that makes the time to make sure you are please before you leave. Thank you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Lilliana R.,"Trinity, Tampa Bay, FL",50,17,53,4.0,2/12/2016,"Great place for a little date night or get together. Again, the light side choices are versatile. My favorites are the Ancho Salmon (cal. 590) and 6oz Sirloin with Grilled Avocado (cal.410). Extra star to Chili on the Salmon, outside of a few seafood restaurants, I am not a big fan of eating seafood at certain places but they did it perfect. Not dry, falls off the fork and perfect color and taste. Bacon burger, my son recommends also reasonably priced. Salads are filling and tasteful  My constructive criticism: Service could be bit more patient and less of a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Kimberly N.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,144,118,3.0,1/16/2015,"Went here for dinner on a Friday night. Stood in front of the hostess' desk and she ignored us for at least five minutes, no eye contact at all and didn't say anything. Finally she acknowledged us and we got our buzzer. We were told a 40-60 min wait but we were seated less than 30 minutes later. Our server was great, we've had him before. We had the chips and queso and then we did the 2 for $20 meal. The queso was great, and my entree of honey chipotle chicken crispers was excellent. I would have given four stars if it wasn't for the hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity
Victor G.,"New Port Richey, FL",10,146,49,4.0,12/18/2015,"Decent meal. Between all of us we had ribs, a quesadilla, and burgers. All was prepared as we asked.

Dennis D.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,5,,2.0,12/22/2016,Place is going downhill. Went for lunch yesterday. Potato soup was cold. Hamburger bun was so full of grease I couldn't pick it  up.

We arrived on Sunday night at 6 pm , not busy at all. Had our drinks and placed our order. Waited 50 minutes for two burgers and a steak. Dads steak was almost raw looking , asked for medium.

Debbie S.,"New Port Richey, FL",9,3,2,1.0,3/1/2015,Chili's 1642 state Road 54 New Port Richey : Last night.  We here not been to chilis in maybe a year. Dk if it's this location or if chilis has just gone down hill.  Drinks margaritas  (2) happy hour. Mostly ice. No discernible alcohol. Husband got steak fajitas.  Smaller portion than last visit. No sizzle on the platter like previous visits. Maybe they have gone to microwave food? Waitress is now only a food runner. Orders taken from a tablet on table which charged us $1. On our bill plus a 20% tip for waitress.  Unlimited chips salsa is limited to the # of x u can find server. Chili's seems like more of a fast food place now. U order & pay from a tablet.

Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",848,2344,2390,3.0,8/9/2013,"Since i'm following a low carb diet, eating out is a challenge.  I wanted something that I didn't cook for a change! I was out at Target on 54 & Little road, and decided, I'm going to try Chili's, since they have a ""Lighter Side menu"". The husbeast, the bestie and I were seated without any preamble and waited only a few minutes for our waitress to come by and offer us our drinks, which we quickly placed.  For dinner, each of us chose something off the Lighter Side, I got the Grilled Chicken Salad, the bestie got the Talipa, but opted to have the rice subbed out for more broccoli, and all the sauces on the side, and the Husbeast got the shrimp tacos.   Everything came out just as we ordered. Sauces that were ordered on the side, came on the side. Substitutions that were asked for, were made. This impressed me because honestly, this usually gets screwed up.  And all the food off this special menu was very tasty.  The only reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was -s-l-o-w-.  We wanted to cash out, but there was one waitress who was just chatting with a couple at the end of her station for over 20 minutes, and the manager had to come and cut her off.  Our waitress delivered our check, and then disappeared for over 8 minutes.  We were on some what of a schedule so this set us back considerably when we already had the money set to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20
Reid M.,"Holiday, FL",0,42,,5.0,4/5/2016,Chili's had been going downhill and I hadn't been in quite a while. Decided to give them another try and was very pleased with the new menu.

Lana W.,"Norfolk, VA",33,1,,2.0,9/29/2016,"I came into Chillis today for my 21st birthday, just to have lunch with my husband and daughter. We came in and we were instantly seated. My husband, my daughter and I had already figured out what drinks, appetizer, and entrees we wanted. I noticed people being sat after us already had drinks and put in there food orders so I asked a server where our server was she claimed she had food to run and argued with my husband about it, the restaurant wasn't busy enough for it to take her 20 minutes to run food (I have worked for restaurants since I was 16), once she came to the table I realized I hadn't even seen her ""running food"". We had already told the pervious server our drink order, well apparently the message wasn't relayed (which wasn't a big deal) we decided that it may take forever for our food to come out so we didn't order an appetizer. When our food came out it was cold at this point we had been there almost 2 hours so I didn't care I just wanted to eat and get out of there. I will probably never be back..

Gina A.,"New Port Richey, FL",39,5,,1.0,7/14/2015,Out to lunch with my 12 year old. We shared the cheese fries which were as good as fries with melted cheese could be. My son ordered the kids pizza which was a different recipe which he didn't care for. The waitress recommended the 'explosion salad' which came with cheese quesadilla. The salad tasted like they sprinkled dishwater dressing on it. The quesadilla also had the same sort of dirty flavor. The unsweetened ice tea was super cloudy. This has not been consistent with previous visits. Seem like things are getting a little sloppy. Service was fine,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20
Shannan T.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",38,87,179,3.0,6/17/2014,"I had chipotle chicken & rice bowl. It came with a appealingly nice salad from the initial looks of it, however, it was mostly iceberg lettuce once I picked out a few greens that were on top. The citrus balsamic vinaigrette was good however. The taste and flavor of the chicken in my main meal was very flavorful and the salsa was tasty as well. My husband got a half sandwich and salad. It was turkey and cheese and it was quite good but a little on the greasy side. Most American families would just appreciate a night out without doing dishes and come to a place like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20
Anthony M.,"New Port Richey, FL",36,168,15,3.0,4/18/2014,"R A N C H !!!   Chili's ranch should earn five stars on it's own.  But I know I need to write a review for this place as a whole. First, I love the fact that they have call ahead seating....kind of like reservations, but 20 minutes in advance.  We called and when we walked in, we were seated immediately.  My sincere apologies to the people that came in before us and had to wait 30 minutes. We frequent this Chili's and service is usually good.  On this occasion it was very slow...drink refills and chips n salsa took forever.  Our server never stopped back during dinner. The dinner itself was good.  My big mouth bites were tasty and grilled perfectly.  My wife's buffalo chicken salad was delicious.  And, did I mention the ranch.

It was fairly busy and an older woman that was waaay too happy waited on us unfortunately. I had my go-to the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich. My dates had the chicken fingers and appetizer sampler. The sliders sucked, the chicken tenders definitely had a wang to them. Like they used fish fry instead of chicken batter. I am not a fan of Chili's anyway but I figured I would give it a try since calories don't count on vacay;) I wanna like the Chili's chain but everything seems so greasy and salty.

I don't know if it's just Chili's in general but the level of service has been horrible the last few times I have went and to different locations. We didnt go to the closer one just bc the last horrible visit. Ok let me stop venting lol. We ordered take out from this location last week because it was late and nothing else was open. My girlfriend ordered a California turkey club and I got  shrimp, steak and chicken fajitas. The bacon on the turkey club was almost rare and the shrimp on the fajitas were hard and disgusting plus they forgot the side of rice and beans so I called to let them know. They told us they would credit us both entrées the next time we come so we decided to order it tonight. Placed the order at 915 got there at 10 and they said they person who took the order gave it to the wrong customer and would take 20 min for a new one.

Kimberly K.,"Port Richey, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2016,"I love Chili's restaurant, but both experiences I've had at this location were awful. I went here a few months ago for lunch with a coworker and the food was awful. I ordered from the lunch menu, a double cheeseburger and it was dry and overcooked. The bun and fries were both cold, it was just terrible and I didn't eat 2/3 of it. Took the leftovers home and gave to my pit bull, he loved it however. So last night my husband and I gave it another shot. We knew we'd have a wait ahead of us, being Friday night and all. Hostess told us 30 minutes at least. No biggie, totally expected it. Once we were seated, our waiter came and took our drink order. It arrived in about 10 minutes. We were busy looking over the menu and didn't mind. Then we placed our appetizer order and waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes later the waiter came out, apologized for the wait, took our meal order and assured us our apps were coming ""right out"". Another 25 minutes and still no apps. Our meal came out, no app...we never got our apps. My husband's steak was dry and had strange sandy like texture inside. I took my chicken home and ate it the next morning so I can't really review that meal since it sat in the fridge overnight before I ate it. We paid the check, including the apps we never received  (my husband doesn't like to complain or make a scene at all) and got outta there. I'll never go back to this location, I'll stick with the Port Richey or Tarpon locations. It's an extra drive but way better service and taste. The only good thing about this location is the sweet little calico kitten that greets you as you're walking to the door.

After what seemed an eternity waiting to order food, I got up from the barside booth and I asked the bartender if I could order something. She said she wasn't my server, and called over a waiter after I had talked to her and the waiter told another server, the one who had taken my drink order, what I wanted.  Fine. No big. So, my server confirms the order, but she didn't hear me say, ""Triple Dipper,"" so when three full appetizers arrived to the table, I explained that was incorrect. I understood. Everything was fine up until she reacted. And oh my god! You'd think I had told her to screw off! My server took the food off of the table with such an attitude that nobody in my party (except the drunk kid) felt comfortable to eat it when half of it came back to the table on another plate.
