Joeily F.,"Saint Cloud, FL",22,1,1,4.0,12/21/2017,"I have been here plenty of times with the most recent time being last night. Diana is the sweetest server and very helpful if you have any questions. Many many options of drinks and meals. Below are  things  i've tried: Appetizers  1) Chicken spotters- (outside of dumpling shell) very good starter, kind of feels like you're eating an egg roll, with chicken inside it, comes with an accompanying sauce, didn't really like the sauce that much.  2) Chicken Wings- they have different flavors to choose from, they add just enough of each sauce and the chicken is not too hard or too bland.  3) Flatbread- have not had in a while, but I remember it being good. 4) Artichoke and spinach dip with nachos- my favorite appetizer- love the the creamy dip, warm with the nachos it makes for a great start!  Meals  1) Egg, tomato, lettuce, Avocado burger - this is the first burger I had there, if you like all the ingredients mentioned above, this is for you. (Also, do not think that's the actual burger name)  2) Pasta- oven baked ziti- warm, warm, lots of tomatoes sauce  Drinks 1) Blood orange sangria- has cinnamon, orange, pomegranate, pretty firm flavor and strong. 2) Patron Margarita-  taste like an orange soda. Has tequila in it.  3) Blue vodka and lime drink- a nice not-too-strong drink, that makes for a smooth sip, while still tasting the vodka. 4) Alabama sunset-  for some reason I don't like anything about this drink except how it looks  Dessert The cookie pan with ice cream is a sweet sweet delight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee

Erin G.,"Orlando, FL",89,91,440,5.0,10/24/2017,if we are down by the Loop near happy hour for BJ's (usually 10 pm or later plus games) we stop for their deal.  I belly up to the bar and Tina Y is frequently the bartender.  She provides great service and is delightful.  She remembers you and is attentive and you get your drinks and food quickly.  Half price mini pizzas and shareable appetizers.

Travis J.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",540,146,423,5.0,9/7/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants thanks to the variety of food they provide and the fact that they brew their own beer. I've been to a few around the area and never reviewed one. But I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience at any BJ's. The service is always good as is their food.  I had orederd their hangover burger which came with an over medium egg and bacon and was served open faced along with a side of fries. The burger was cooked to my liking and I couldn't finish. Thankfully I didn't because I later received a surprise dessert that I've never seen on the menu and apparently a secret item. Well the secrets out I guess! It was a beignet topped with ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries! This is a must have!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee
Ashley B.,"Orlando, FL",192,200,1143,5.0,7/18/2017,"We stopped here for a late night experience and we were impressed. The late night weekday happy hour starts at 10 pm and offers $1 off beer and half off appetizers along with other deals. My boyfriend can't have wheat and thankfully for him our server Katie was able to find a delicous beer he can have.  Our server Katie was amazing. She had a wonderful personality, very attentive and knew the beer on draft and on the menu inside/out. With her help he ordered two beers.   I got the ahi tuna app for half off making it only $5 and the 10 piece wings for $5 as well. You can't beat these late night happy hour deals and the food is awesome.

Aileen C.,"Orlando, FL",160,150,306,4.0,11/16/2017,"Ordered the appetizer sampler which came with boneless wings (which we had tossed in glazed root beer) - I was a really big fan of the flavor... avocado egg rolls - this was delicious!!!, mozzarella sticks - standard, and Spinach artichoke dip - standard. There was a lot of food, enough to share with 3-4 people. I got the BJs mini deep dish pizza. It was good but a little too doughy - but I guess that's expected since it's deep dish. My fiancé got the prime rib dinner weekend special. It came with soup, the clam chowder we really good, the prime rib with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes, and a pazooki dessert that we had to ask to take to go since we were so full. His entrée was for less than $30 for tons of food. Not bad!  I will like to come back again and try different things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee

Janet G.,"Middleburg, FL",7,8,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Yesterday, my adult son and I stopped in to BJ's.  I'm pretty sure it was at this location. Our server was Matt! He was such a wonderful young man. Courteous, professional, yet personal. I have never been to a BJ's restaurant before yesterday. The food even tops my favorite all time restaurant ( which I won't name). I ordered the Mac-n-cheese.   I thought, 'this is what Mac- n-Cheese must taste like in Heaven.' During our visit, a young man stopped by our table with a tray full of individual size ( in a shot glass) Rootbeer Floats. He gave my son and I one. YIKES!  Man that was GOOD!!!! We also got the small dessert name,Pazooki for free because we downloaded the restaurants app. I got The Macadamia Nut one and he got the Carmel one. We were delirious with delight. Our entire dining experience was DIVINE. Thank you so much...and a big hug and shout-out to Matt( our server). Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee
Bonnie B.,"Inverness, FL",62,26,12,5.0,12/11/2017,This place is amazing OMG second time here but two different places it's a chain. I want to try everything on the menu can't wait for our next trip here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee
Lisa S.,"Whitby, Canada",62,334,26,4.0,3/31/2017,"After two days of driving, our large group ended up meeting at BJ's for lunch before we were able to check into our rental property. I went inside to see what the wait was like and they took my phone number and told me they'd text me when our table was ready, about 15 minutes since there was 6 adults and a baby. Not too bad and the text thing was super handy. The menu here is super big, that's why I chose it - simply because with 6 adults and at least 3 of them being picky eaters, I knew there would be something for everyone and almost all of us were sick of burgers and fries by this point. One of my buddies wanted to try some of their beer but didn't know what kind, so they brought him three to sample before he chose! Cool! I ended up ordering the bacon brisket, which turns out is a burger (duh) with a caesar and a fancy drink. The drink was good but nothing to write home about and not a ton of booze in it either. We all got some artichoke and spinach drip, which was really good, and my friends got the fried artichokes, which were awesome!! Yum! The burger was good, not what I was expecting but nice and tasty just the same. The salad was good if a bit soggy, could have used less dressing in my opinion. I guess this is a Canadian thing, but a bunch of people ordered chicken tenders and when they asked the waitress for plum sauce, she had no idea what that was and didn't know what sweet and sour sauce was either!!  I would definitely come back to BJs, the menu size alone is a huge plus, anyone can find something, and the service was prompt and very very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee

Melinda B.,"Saint Cloud, FL",265,243,930,4.0,1/15/2017,Yelp 100 challenge 2017!  33/100  For a franchise restaurant this place is pretty good. They have a variety of craft beers. The best thing to do is get a flight to try a few different beers. They have a large menu. I prefer a burger with my beer. The burgers are pretty good. The dining area is really large and they have a full bar. I have had some events with large groups. They usually set aside one side of the restaurant and provide a buffet or a set menu to chose from. The wait time is average maybe 10/15 minutes unless it's a Sunday afternoon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee
Laura H.,"London, Canada",17,76,14,3.0,3/13/2017,"I dined here several times while staying at a vacation rental close to the Loop. This franchise was new to me and overall I had better lunchtime experiences, but overall I would say this was better than average fare for a restaurant that serves ""everything"". The restaurant space itself is massive and offers both booth and table options. There is a large bar area as well. Lunch: I loved their endless soup and salad combo ($9.5). I started with broccoli cheddar soup and the wedge salad. Salad was a touch skimpy on the blue cheese, but still very fresh lettuce and a decent amount of cherry tomatoes. The broccoli cheddar soup was comparable to ones I've had at Panera Bread. When I found myself still hungry, I ""refilled"" my soup with their chili. It was hearty, a bit of a kick that was tempered by the sour cream garnish. On another occasion I tried their tomato cheese salad. It was my least favourite of the options I tried, but still fine. Their grilled cheeses were great ($7.25). Huge portions. Root beer ribs were a bit sweet, but tender. Lunch prices are very reasonable.  Dinner: Less successful. No endless soup and salad available. I had one of their ""enlightened"" entrees: the Peruvian chicken quinoa bowl. ($13.5) It was my favourite entree here. The chicken was very moist and the tomato/onion/mushroom/spinach compote it sat on was nicely spiced. I tried their Portobello mushroom salad ($5.75) that didn't come with the asparagus as described. I alerted the staff who brought me a bowl of asparagus. I had mostly finished the salad at that point so not a great solution. And the worst entree I tried was the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs ($15.75). Yes, there was a lot of food. The garlic roll was the best part. The pasta was mushy, the sauce was bland and the meatballs tasted like sawdust. It said ""sausage blend"" but I would have guessed chicken meatballs from the texture. Beer: Solid. I liked the Brewhouse Blonde. There are lots of choices. It is a brewhouse so you're expecting good craft beer. I was not disappointed. Service: Hit and miss. Some servers were great. Others ok. One literally left our table and disappeared. Never came back. Someone else had to bring us our meals and bill. Odd. Overall I'd recommend for casual sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee

Best Happy Hour prices on food and drinks. Great Parmesan encrusted chicken and Jambalaya on the entrees. So many good appetizers like avocado egg rolls, ahi poke tuna and blonde asparagus.

Barbara Librie H.,"Celebration, FL",17,13,,5.0,11/10/2017,"BJ's is a lunch favorite for us. We always enjoy a Ahi Poke appetizer and they accommodate my request for no onions so we know it is always fresh. Today we shared the Prime Rib dip sandwich with fries and it was more than enough for us. Mom had the classic grilled cheese sandwich which she really enjoyed. Our server was very attentive and checked back often to make sure we were okay. And, best of all and in spite of the noisy atmosphere, our grandson slept through the entire meal! We had lunch again today for Veteran's Day. My husband's lunch was complimentary as a thank you for his service. The restaurant was quiet crowded with other Veterans and their families. We both had the BBQ Bison Burger medium rare. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. I ordered mine with no bun, pico or aioli. It came out served on a bed of lettuce with coleslaw and was exactly what I hoped for.

To my surprise they took the shoestring fries off their menu. I was just there 2 or 3 weeks ago when it was on the menu. The new fries aren't that good. From 1 to 10, I would say a 3. As far as their other food that's good. I had a chicken bacon sandwich and it was delicious. The calamari is always delicious.

Heather W.,"Orlando, FL",361,207,163,4.0,5/1/2017,"A friend and I stopped into BJs Friday after work with no idea what we would want but within minutes of being seated, and after seeing the seasonal insert, we had decided!  On Friday and Saturday after 4pm and Sunday all day BJs is doing Prime Rib meal for $28 that comes with a soup or salad, Prime Rib, two sides, and a pizzoki. After spending some time looking at my options I choose the Broccoli and Cheddar soup which was honestly my favorite I have ever had. It was a smooth, but hearty cheese soup with nice sized pieces (I find most places have time specks) of broccoli, and packed with flavor. I ordered my Prime Rib medium rare, and while it came out slightly more rare than medium rare, it was like a party in my mouth! The meat belted like butter and the seasoning that they use on the outside gave a nice kick. My sides were steamed broccoli (a bit on the raw side, but I like it that way) and a baked potato and both were just you normal sides. For my pizzoki I got the regular Chocolate Chunk rather than a fancy flavor and it was the perfect end of the meal. Also, I ended up saving him a bit of each course and I had plenty to take home and warm up for another meal which made it well worth the almost $35 it ended up being with tip. My only qualm was our server. She was nice, but sadly we had gotten water after working all day in the heat and we never got a refill and rarely saw her so we didn't have many opportunities to ask for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=20
Marcus H.,"Chesterfield, VA",55,75,26,5.0,4/20/2017,"My first time here, my girlfriends been here a few times, we came to watch the college game. I took my time to check out the menu and there were tons of options everything from salads to steak to pizza and tons inbetween. The service was awesome, fast and friendly. We never had to ask for anything, it was always offered to us. There were plenty televisions around to be able to see the game from start to finish and just enough sound, not the overbearing sounds of the television when your trying to have a conversation.

Jason P.,"Saint Cloud, FL",24,61,149,4.0,3/25/2017,"Decided to take my mother before she headed back to PA.  We got there at about 4:30pm and sat right away.  We all enjoyed our meals and dessert.  So, we started off with their potato skins and fried calamari.   We love their potato skins, reason being how crispy they are.   Calamari was a first and we were very happy with those.  One guess got their homemade rootbeer, he said it was really good and got a 2nd glass.  For dinner, one guess got a pepperoni pizza and loved it.  Second guess had the roastbeef dip, loved this as well.  Third guess got the Ahi tuna salad, liked the salad but was very disappointed with the size and of the Tuna size it self.  They were maybe the size of a thumb nail each.  Picture is very misleading.  (Would not order it agian).  I got the chicken  tacos, very good and would get them again.  We finished our meal with the three pizzookie dessert.  Had cookies n cream, monkey bread and PB bread.  We highly recommend these to finish your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=20

Beer deserves 5 Stars. Their craft IPA called Hopstorm was fantastic. I'm a huge IPA fan and this certainly is up there with the best so try it.  I ordered the calamari and it was pretty messed up. Most of the pieces were stuck together so after you detached them you were left with just squid and separate batter. What a mess.  If you're looking for good beer though come here.

Our female server who I will not name on here needs to find a new line of work because she doesn't know how to do her job. Not only was she lacking personality, after she took our order never once did she check on us to see if everything was alright. I was sucking down ice cubes because I was out of Pepsi. When I finally hunted her down I had to ask her for drink refills. When it came time we wanted our bill I had to ask another server to find our waitress and tell her we want our bill so we could leave. Five minutes later she showed up. On a good note our pizza was the best pizza we have had in a long time! I would get it again but next time I will get it to go. We will not be back to dine there again. For the price they charge there and to get the worst service it's not worth our time and money. I would recommend Bahama Breeze and Cheddars down the road!

Louise S.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",343,557,2626,3.0,2/23/2016,"35/100 of 2016 challenge This is usually a good place to go. The wait for a table was not very long and we were  approached by our waiter fairly soon after being seated. That is where the good service stops. Our order for drinks was taken within 5 minutes of us being seated. It took us another 15 to get our drinks and by the way, we were seating in a booth in the bar section. We were there just afternoon time on a Sunday. The food itself was cooked well and tasty. I had the portabello swiss burger, one friend had shrimp tacos and the other grilled chicken. It just took a long time to get. We placed our 2nd drink order once we had received our 1st one because we knew it would a while to get it. We also placed our food order at the same time. It took 45 minutes to get our food and 20 to get our 2nd drinks. The service was clearly slow. Our waitress Victoria only came back once to check on us to see if we needed anything and once to see if we were ready for the check or if we were having dessert, in that order. Yep the check and then asked about dessert. Our waitress was pleasant enough just not attentive enough. Maybe she had too many tables but I felt she should have checked on us more often. The restrooms were clean and maintained well.  The noise level here is loud and louder and its not because of the TV's I feel. I would go back again and give them another try.

This place is a bar which also serves food (which is a good thing!) They offer a large enticing menu, with plenty of choices. I had a brunette beer. They offer several combination beers that looked really good - a blend of 2 beers. I topped off my meal with broccoli cheddar soup, and had no room for the desert I had my mind on!

It took almost 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. We were seated after and opened up our silverware, it was dirty. Asked for a second pair, dirty. We told the busser and he didn't seem to care & just gave us our third, which was finally clean.  Our food came out on time, but it wasn't great. unfortunately everyone around of us was having a bad experience so after we ate, we paid for our meal & we left immediately.

Today it took 45 minutes to get the order placed at the bar and when we got it home, my roast beef dip had nothing to dip it in. Cool.

We went there again a couple days later for brunch and it didn't disappoint! I believe that was the best mimosa I've ever had!

Juan V.,"Broward, FL",17,7,11,5.0,12/19/2014,"I love this place. The food is delicious and service is great. One of my favorite plates is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The crust on the chicken is nice and crunchy, and goes very will with the sun dried tomatoes. Personally, I don't think the basil garnish on the chicken does anything for this plate besides just add some color contrast. The side of White cheddar mashed potatoes is very well balanced and has a tart but subtle cheese taste.  For desert, this time we tried the Smores Pizookie. Overall, I would give it an 7/10 if you have a pallet for traditional. Expecting a Smores desert, I would have liked a graham cracker to show up somewhere, but alas it was absent. The substitute, peanut butter , while creative made it very rich and almost impossible to finish after a meal.

My family and I came here on a Sunday and the wait was the standard 10-15 minutes. We sat due  and waited 10 minutes before someone greeted us. After the waitress greeted us, we were obviously able to order everything since we were sitting there for 10 minutes. The four waters came 5-7 minutes after the waitress greeted us.  Our appetizer came 20 minutes after that and entrees came 30 minutes after the appetizer. I'm no expert but I wouldn't think it takes 30 minutes to make a burger, a salad, a pasta dish , and a kids pizza.  The service and preparation time were unbelievable.

We ordered the ahi tuna app along with the stuffed mushrooms, both of which were awesome and very fresh tasting. The mushrooms were hot and very flavorful with the right amount of cheese and seasonings.  My wife and I split a buffalo chicken pizza which had a very smoky BBQ flavor to it. I didn't much care for that, I think I would have proffered more traditional buffalo sauce but my wife loved it.  We also ordered one of the draft cream sodas and a triple pazookie....

William A.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",90,20,1,1.0,2/20/2016,"Had my worst restaurant experience ever! Yesterday I was in the mood to eat dinner and picked a place here in Kissimmee. I was promptly sat down and given a menu. 5 minutes later another customer sits down at an adjacent table. In the time I was sitting at the table the adjacent table had not one or two employees stop at the table but three! It wasn't until the third person realized that we were sitting there and not being attended that she said did someone assist us yet. Ok, progress! So the person comes over and takes our drink order of: an iced tea and a blueberry Sea Dog. 5 min later they returned with the tea and told me Sea Dog is a seasonal beer. (It's not a seasonal beer. They have a brewery in the Disney Springs vicinity.) So I ordered a Sam Adams. The guy disappears and now it's 10 minutes later... This just turned into a wtf moment! The adjacent table had their drinks well before I even placed mine. Hmm... The other adjacent table that was there prior to me arriving was just departing from their meal and it was a party of 8. I looked over at that table. It wasn't being bussed but instead there were two employees standing there conversing. One has using the back of the chair to place their weight on to use it as a crutch to support their front weight.  Now here's the questions. 1) Server - where was this person? Why wasn't I greeted promptly? What happened to my drink? Why weren't a small party of two people served the drink at the same time? How long does it take to pour a draft beer?  2) Staff -  Why were you standing around in public? Can't you do that out of people view? How is it that the manager/assistant manager/hostess did not see all the lack of professionalism that was taking place at your establishment? If you know the place is packed or not why isn't there someone there to pickup on overflow? I didn't know that acquaintances get preferential treatment, such as being greeted by various members of staff yet bypass other customers which makes it appear like the other customers don't exist? 9pm isn't a busy hour on a Friday evening. Yet it felt like no one had the intention of serving me. It felt like whoever was in charge of my table had called it quits and made enough money for the night. Being a server is part of hospitality and extremely important to the success of the business. Anything less will not keep your franchise afloat.  To make matters worse I eat healthy and I saw some great items on the menu that I would have tried. Now I will never try them because of this fiasco. Eating on a consistent timing is of importance to me. So after 30 minutes of getting nowhere I plainly got up and walked out. I wasn't going to make a fuss. Instead I headed over to Bonefish Grill.  Bonefish proceeded to sit me down and have the server at my table 2 minutes after being seated. Not only was I greeted promptly I was also recommend drinks, appetizers, and a main course. The difference between establishments were the difference between a preschool diploma and a doctorate diploma.  @bjsrestaurants you need to retrain your staff. It was not only embarrassing but laughable. I would pick any other restaurant/brewery over your lackluster Kissimmee location.

In the restrooms, the floor is clearly dirty and sticky around the urinals, there are paper towels everywhere. The soap dispenser is empty and there is no paper in the stall I could look at.

We were told to go back to the hostess stand and a different girl told me that we would have to be put back on a wait list because I ""didn't request"" that.

My mom and I were there for a quick lunch and a movie--or so we thought!  We ordered a flatbread goat-cheese, veggie appetizer and California chicken club sandwich. Yummy!! The appetizer was very flavorful, and it had plenty of veggies on it! The downfall was that on this particular Sunday, it was pretty busy, and we were not served our meals promptly.  Our waiter was very sweet, and offered a cup of soup because it was taking so long; we just wanted our sandwiches so we could get to the movies (we declined the soup, it was over 90 degrees outside). We eventually received our food, and the sandwich was also very tasty...it was like a toasted BLT with avocado and chicken, and I would definitely order it again!! It did take about an hour to get our meal served, and the waiter was very apologetic. It wasn't his fault, and we told him so. However, the manager came over to check on us, and offered us free movie tickets because we missed our movie due to the slow service...very unexpected, and appreciated!  We ended up going to a later movie that day. We appreciated the concern from the staff and for them making things right. This is the kind place you definitely want to return to, time and time again.

The service was pretty great. Our waitress was prompt, and quite funny. She wasn't some bland food servant of any sorts. The other waiters and waitresses who were near us on our way to our table greeted us nicely and were welcoming as well.  The food was also quite impressive especially for a really, really busy chain restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Fetuccine Alfredo and, while not as good as Olive Gardens, it was well prepared and quite tasty. The rest of my family was also pleased with their dishes.

We ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was wonderful! The sauce had a nice tang to it, the chicken was crisp on the outside while remaining moist on the inside. And don't get me started on the mashed potatoes! They were probably my favorite part of the dish.  For dessert we got the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie.

We've been to this restaurant over 2 dozen times and we can't remember one good experience. We had joined the reward club and various deals had brought us back to ""give it another try"" but today was the last straw. Being ""loyalty members"" we are often given surveys after our meals and EVERY time we've been we mention how EXTREMELY SLOW the service is. This has not been fixed since we started visiting over 2 years ago.  Today, we entered and were quickly seated (not greeted but seated) as it was not busy at all. After sitting for several minutes the server made her way to the table. She did not ask how we were or exchange any pleasantries whatsoever, but went straight into asking for our drink and appetizer order. We placed our entire order and she disappeared for the duration of our very long wait for our food. When our food finally arrived over 30 MINUTES LATER, it was missing a sauce it comes with. We waited an additional 5 minutes for the sauce as all the tables around us (who had arrived after us finished their meals and left). We finished our meals, unvisited by our server for the duration as well as 10 minutes after. When she returned, she asked if we'd like dessert, to which we declined and asked for our check. She returned 10 minutes later. Honestly I would've loved to pay by phone (on the app) but the check hadn't been updated. Another 10 minutes goes by before she decides to peek her head out of the kitchen, myself now standing at our table actively looking for her to return my credit card.

Dishes that we haven't liked so much: New Orleans Jambalaya, avocado roll appetizers (way too much avocado), BBQ beef sandwich (it was ok, just not great like our other usuals). AND THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL...DESSERT: pizookie. A pizza cookie. They make the cookies in the dip dish tins that they make the pizza in. So you have a large cookie, topped with a big scoop of ice cream.  Yummmmm. We really like the chocolate chip, the Ghirardelli triple chocolate, the peanut butter, the Oreo...I always get the peanut butter with chocolate ice cream (usually comes with vanilla). We tried the red velvet one one time when it first came out, didn't really like it. Oh the white chocolate macadamia nut one is good too. Also the Apple Berry Crumble is really good.

The ahi was good, light in flavor, and would appeal to those who don't want to get stuffed. It's served with chopped up lettuce and wheat tortilla type chips. My only complaint would be there are too many chips for the amount of ahi you get.  Another new item on their menu is the Pork Chop Entree which comes with two Porkchops, marinated teriyaki apples,  green beans, mash potatoes, and a small amount of stone ground mustard on the side. Delicious. The apples with the pork really work well together. The mustard is wonderful but can be a bit over powering at times but over all wonderfully done. I'm also a fan of their fish tacos, the avocado and southwest rolls. They have some great sandwiches and for dessert you can't pass up the pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=160

Ironically, the managers were very apologetic and accommodating.  They really did try but were having a  bad staff day. I have been out enough to know it happens.  They credited several items on the check so we knew that they were sincere.   The burger was delicious but a little cold.   The chicken marsala was tasty but overcooked with soggy green beans, I like mine a little crispy or crunchy; these probably came from a can.  The dip was tasty but late.  The beer flight was fantastic.

The delivery of the mayo and ketchup after we had already given up eating was ridiculous.    At least the waiter's admission that he just plain forgot about the garlic bread was refreshing.  Never again for ANY of them - consider yourself warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=160

It took an extra 20 minutes to get our last dish and then another 10 minutes to get our food that was sent back for being wrong, and when it came back the chicken was very raw. We weren't offered anything as gratitude, and we were charged twice for one of the dishes we had once. We were expected to pay for the full dinner that was an absolute abortion. The manager didn't feel the need to say a single thing to us and that reflects on the professionalism of a restaurant. We were very disappointed and nobody cared at all.

Michelle C.,"Kissimmee, FL",5,13,4,4.0,6/6/2012,"For me, BJ's is about the pizzas and the beer. Although, their other menu items are also worth trying but these 2 items are definitely their highlights.  I love coming here for happy hour mostly to eat. I believe it's 4-7 on weekdays and then maybe 9 til closing. During Happy Hour their appetizers are all 50% off and so are their mini deep dish pizzas. Totally bang for the buck at this point. Their drinks aren't discounted as much as their food during this time but it's still cheaper than the regular prices.  I like their Bacon Cheeseburger Mini Deep Dish Pizza. It tastes exactly like a BACON CHEESEBURGER. The toppings include: sausage, bacon, red onions, pickles, and cheese. I believe the marinara sauce on the pizza acts as ketchup.  During Happy Hour it's only $5.00. If you don't want so much carb, you can also go for their flatbreads. Also, discounted during HH. I like their Chicken Club and Chicken Pesto. The Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good. A tiny bit spicy but really yummy and low cal. The Ahi Poke. When I first had this, the quality of the Tuna was good. It tasted fresh and the portion size was good for appetizer. It's also around $5.00 during Happy Hour. Comes with fried wonton chips on the side to scoop up the tuna. I don't know what happened, but recently, their fish quality went down. It's completely noticeable and I refuse to order it anymore. The Beers: I'm not an expert in beer but I was determined to try every specialty beer they carried at BJ's. So I just went down the list every time I went back to Bj's. I really like the Blonde Beer.

Decided on BJ's Rest and Brew House. From the outside the place looks very inviting, walking in, (A revolving glass door met us at the entrance, cool hugh?). We entered the restaurant, met by a greeter, (She was cute) and was brought in to a lightly lit, great looking restaurant. Sat at a booth that was not too tight ( I am a LARGER person, lol.) Our server met us with her trainee just seconds after we where sat, and apologized for making us wait, introduced herself and her trainee, (I decided to leave the names out). Again, our server was very cute, made a few suggestions for us , took our drink order, and gave us a moment to look over the menu and make a few decisions. Price wise the menu prices seem to fit the area and the décor/atmosphere. I decided to start with the suggested Clam Chowder for an Appetizer, and ordered the California Burger for my lunch entrée. Food was delivered in a short time after ordering and we where NOT interrupted more than twice during our meal ( A personal pet peeve). We where not able to leave room for dessert, but I am looking forward to trying the BJ's Pizookie. I am not able to say much about the price as was not privy to our total, (Thank You ""S"" for another great Lunch.) I am guessing the amount is/was close to $20ish/$30ish($25.00). I would defiantly suggest going here again and even though it is a chain, the food did not taste, look as though it was JUST a chain. Try them out and let me know what you think. Descriptions are from the official websites Menu:   CLAM CHOWDER New England-style chowder loaded with clams, potatoes, onions and spices. Large bowl or carved-out sourdough loaf. CALIFORNIA BURGER* Our half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise ranch dressing.

You'll  be sitting there eating and having a conversation and all of a sudden out of nowhere you hear ""WOOOOO!"" (loud!) from behind the bar. I mean it's startling!

Marcel M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,9,,1.0,2/10/2011,The layout of the restaurant is great:wide open. However the food was disappointing.We went there for happy hour when appetizers were half off. We ordered nachos with their home made chili.The nachos were terrible.The chili tasted like it was out of a can:it was blend and almost like a puree.To make it worse the chili was all the way in the bottom of the nachos.You literally have to push away the chips to get to the bottom of the plate and try to get it .And then you can not pick it up with the chips since it is not chunky. We also ordered calamari.This was blend also.I had to put loads of salt an pepper on it to no avail.The zesty marinara sauce and lemon garlic sauce simply didn't live up to their names. After being disappointed with these 2 items we decided to leave without trying anything else. What really made me go there was the attractive look of their building and to try their own beer.I was expecting for the beer the be reasonably  priced since they make it themselves but boy was  surprised:4.95 for a pint.

Marcy E.,"Portland, OR",5,16,,2.0,11/24/2013,"I've been to this BJ's twice and both times were terrible experiences.  The first time I went with a friend to try something new. We got in and were seated immediately, which actually didn't matter because a waiter didn't show up for 20 minutes, and the other waiters who passed by us didn't bother asking if we needed help. We ended up getting up from our seats and were about to walk out the door until the hostess suggest she bring out the manager and he would help us. He treated us to a free appetizer, the ahi poke, which was pretty good. The rest of the food still took a very long time to come out and wasn't anything amazing.  The second (and final) time was last Friday with my husband. He's a fan of breweries and we both wanted somewhere good to eat. I figured I'd give this place another shot but soon realized that was a big mistake.  We're first greeted by a very pushy host about the reward card. I had actually filled one out last time but - surprise! - wasn't in the system. And I definitely wasn't filling out another card before my meal.  Once again, it was packed and once again the food and service was really slow. I wonder if they're always packed because it takes them so long to bring out food (maybe half those people are from the lunch rush??). And this time the food was terrible. All of our food was lukewarm; we got the two appetizer bites dishes, a pasta dish, and shrimp tacos (everything that should have been coming out hot). The waiter was also slow getting to our table, which I'm not sure why since we only saw him go to our table and the two on either side of us - what else could he be doing?  All in all, this place gives the chain restaurant a bad name. Better stick to local breweries for now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=100

This place is a nice blend of modern edged sports pub and  brew house style burger joint.  Flat screens abound, multi-level seating is ample and good food and drink are plentiful. For such a big place, it's not that loud, even though it appeared to be roughly 70% full.  I had no problem hearing and keeping up a conversation with my dinner mates. Our server, Kendal, was a rather handsome fella with a super outgoing personality who immediately took our drink order and gave  us time to contemplate appetizers.  We ordered three - fried artichoke hearts, Cantina fries (smothered with sauces that made the whole appetizer taste like a big taco chili  - DELISH!) and calamari. ALL were delicious, served hot and well flavored. After noshing on appetizers, we ordered lunch - ME : BBQ pulled pork slider with a BBQ chicken breast and fries. MY THREE DINNER PALS: bacon cheeseburger, quesadillas and a personal pepperoni pizza with a Caesar salad - good American comfort food that certainly provided us with the much needed energy to take on the Christmas shopping adventures ahead of us.  Would I come back to BJ's?

We had a party of 12. And the foods got mixed-up. I had ordered the corn fritters (delicious). The appetizer sampler was good too. The main course for my husband and I were the ribs and chicken meal. All was dandy until I cut into the chicken. The chicken was not fully cooked. Smoked chicken is not fleshy pink when you cut towards the center of the chicken. The waitress looked and said ""she'll get her manager."" This probably happens a lot there. The manager came back with it looks like that because its smoked but I'll have them cook it for another 7 minutes. To me if the chicken is fully cooked why would you have to cook it for another 7 minutes. I end-up not eating that but just ate my sides and took the chicken home and didn't eat it. We spent $255 on 6 adults and 6 kids. Gave a $60 tip. Was not looking for hand-outs or freebies. Just felt like it was a typical line that was used to go back to cook the chicken longer so they were not at fault for serving raw chicken. The desserts were great.

Our server gave us attitude the whole time especially when we asked questions about the food. Then we saw her smiling and being nice to her other customers. Later, she came back to our table to grab the plates. And right after she left, not even 30 second after, she made her coworker give us the check because she supposedly went to the bathroom? Wth!!! And the register was located right behind us! That night wasn't even a busy night. My hubby and i even noticed that the server of the table behind us was really rude too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
Kaila J.,"Orlando, FL",61,96,79,3.0,2/14/2011,Great Tuna Poki and Avocado rolls were great! Fish tacos were okay. Slow service and staff in not knowledgeable about menu items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
Katie K.,"Groveland, FL",5,28,5,3.0,2/29/2012,"This is the third time I've dined here. The food is just okay and since I don't drink the beer is not a draw for me. On Feb 26, we took some out of town guests there and the service was awful. It took at least 30 minutes to get our food and barely saw our waitress during the visit. I would expect this if the restaurant was crowded, but it was actually a slow night. I gave it three stars because we've never had a problem with the service before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
Scott P.,"Brewster, NY",21,112,8,5.0,3/19/2011,"One of my favorite things about my annual trip to Florida is going to the chain-you-have-never-heard-of restaurant.  Why stick with popular chains like Chili's and Red Lobster when you can make your way to a BJ's or an Abuelo's?  You can pretend you're in a neat trendy bistro, even when you're stuck in Chainland, Florida. Anyway, BJ's was a really pleasant surprise.  There was a 45 minute wait, and we decided to stick it out.  They served us beers while waiting and gave us some really great deep dish pizza samples.  Very thoughtful.  Maybe it was just that I was hungry, but it was among the best deep dishes I have had. We snuck into a table at the bar once one opened up.  The bar is cool spot with a big wall of TV's - great for watching a game.  Our server was excellent and attentive.  Nice selection of their own beers.  I went with the Brown Lager and the Porter...both were really tasty. Went with the flat bread pizza appetizer - nice choice.  For dinner, the choice was tough.  Their menu was a extensive and a bit overreaching.  I went out on a limb and went with the pot roast.  Even better choice - the pot roast was tender and melts in your mouth. Even though I was stuffed to the gills, I had to try to pizookie.  Now, I don't OMG much, but OMG.  Warm white chocoloate macadamia cookie in a pie tin topped with ample amounts of ice cream.  Right up my alley. Highly recommended.  So...next time you're in Florida, why go with that tired chain restaurant you've been to a million times?  Chain it up in a new way with BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
John F.,"Orlando, FL",15,16,,5.0,10/8/2009,"There is one reason to go to BJ's Brewhouse. It's not the deepdish pizza, which is excellent, it's not the jambalaya, which will rock your taste buds, it's not the hamburgers, which will redefine for you what you think of as a hamburger. It's not even the microbrewed beers, for which BJ's is justifiably famous (Try the Red Ale or the Heffeweisen).  No, none of those excellent features are the reason to come to BJ's. It's just one word, Pizzookie. It's a cookie (your choice), baked in a pizza tin, served hot and topped with ice cream. Heaven! The location can get busy, so take advantage of the call ahead seating or enjoy the wait in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
Christopher G.,"Homestead, FL",10,5,,5.0,8/19/2012,"YET ANOTHER Great BJ's that Ive been to. Fantastic food and atmosphere right in the emerging ""The Loop"" area on Osceola. Food was fantastic as always. GREAT place to go for sports and great food and some great beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-kissimmee?start=180
