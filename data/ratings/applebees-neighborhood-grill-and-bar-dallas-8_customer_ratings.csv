66,Don H.,"Plano, TX",1,16,,3.0,2012-01-06,"For dinner Wednesday evening, I ordered the Fish&Chips. The menu specifically states the meal comes with fries and slaw. It did not come with slaw. NP. I finally got my waitress' attention. She informed they do not include slaw unless a person specifically asks for it. So I did. Boy was it bad. I think they instituted this policy because they saw nobody eats it. The policy they need to impement is teaching their cooks to make coleslaw. Then, people would eat it. Anyway, the wife ordered a cajun shrimp pasta which she hated. So we swapped dinners. She doesn't like slaw and the fish suited her fine. I thought the cajun pasta dish was very good. The restaurant is very nice, and there are PLENTY of TVs, so we caught all the sports we wanted. The service was a bit lacking, which I do not understand because it was not busy. Our waitress didn't appear to be focused on attending our needs. But she was not rude nor insulting, so I'm guessing she just had a bad night. We would most definitely come back. But we would not order the coleslaw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8?start=80,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001
60,Leslie C.,"Dallas, TX",102,32,10.0,1.0,2012-02-25,"I wish I could rate this 0 stars, but I can't! After this whole fiasco of a horrible lunch I get cussed out by their trailer trash bartender for voicing my opinion of this Applebees from hell! So go here if you want to be disrespected and cussed out after you spent your hard earned money! Go here if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes for a shrimp & spinach salad (that they forgot to put the shrimp on!!) and a cup of soup. This place is so unorganized that it took them 15 minutes to bring me out the shrimp for the salad that took 30 min, another 15 minutes for a second salad, plus another 5 minutes for the last and final of the endless salads which again they messed up by drenching it in dressing (they bring them out on this tiny kidney shaped saucer pan which I don't understand why they changed up the lunch when they would bring you a full plate?) Towards the end of our meal, I wanted to give the waiter a tip even though he had been somewhat unattentive the whole time..  So waited for him to pick up the bill so he could bring me change, but he never did! I waited for 5-7min more & then decided I would simply go up to the bar to get some change so I could go, but before I could the bartender said something I didn't catch, told me to hold on, then ran out the front door...?? I was left standing there like what is going on with this place, tried to wait once again to see if she was coming back but now its like 1 hour in---for some lunch!?! Thinking everyone who works here must be on something I just shook my head then left and said forget it~ But this is when it gets really good: Outside as I walk to my car I say out loud ""This place is so unorganized!"" & the bartender hears me so she takes offense, gets all Gun-ho in my face & says ""What you're calling me unorganized my customer ran off with my slip?!! If you think I'm unorganized why don't you go tell my manager, then"" I was beyond words at that point I saw red! Words were definitely exchanged! But my point is you don't argue with a customer, ever, and she didn't even know why I had said that!! It was my opinion and I have every right to it!! This place is shot to hell!

The appetitizer was large and greasy to fill you and the main dish was small to save themselves some money. When the dessert came out, it was a cookie with two lumps of ice cream. It was terribly made as if a 6 year old attempted and failed. My dollars were wasted here. Only reason I came was to accomadate distance for a friend and she knew there was an applebees here.

The service was horribly slow, our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and I had an empty drink for most of my visit. I normally would have ordered a desert but I didn't want to risk having to sleep in the booth and have it for breakfast considering how long everything seemed to be taking. The manager while actively engaging anyone foolish enough to make eye contact with her as she made her rounds offered little assistance.

I paid and tipped and returned home.   The steak was okay, but the shrimp had a spoiled smell.  So I avoided the shrimp and ate the steak.  Trust me after an evening in the restroom, I will never go back to a Applebee's again.  They can keep that Neighborhood Restaurant spirit to themselves.  I prefer to sleep in my bed and not in my bathroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8?start=80,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

But this time they switched the menu around & added some stuff & took away some. My boyfriend always gets the ribs & could add a full rack for so many more dollars. They had taken that option away. Our server however was going to let him order the whole ribs as long as he paid a $4 fee which would be like a side of chicken but just substituted for a half rack of ribs. 10-15 min. later we hear the manager say he needs to talk to our waiter in the back room (the manager was being very loud & swearing in front of the customers & you could tell he was not happy at all.) A few min later our waiter comes out & tells us he just got yelled at for doing that & we would have to order something else or pay for each thing separately. He askes if we would like to talk to the manager & we say no. After our waiter leaves to go get us another menu his manager comes rushing out of the back & PUSHES one of his employees out of his way. He said our waiter told him we wanted to talk to him, the waiter didn't even go back to talk to him, we watched him the whole time. & while he would walk away from our table he would just stare.  Needless to say this isn't the 1st time we have had a problem with him.& there was two other people who also had problems.

21,Whitney F.,"Carrollton, TX",53,2,,2.0,2015-06-27,"Having been a server for 10+ years, I'm pretty lenient when it comes to my wait staff. I'll notice little things most others won't while dining out, and take that into consideration when it comes to my server. Having said that, I absolutely hate the service at this location. I wish I would have read the reviews before coming in, because I would have saved myself the trouble. The food was good! That's the only saving grace about this establishment. My family and I came in around 4 and sat in the bar, and things went downhill from there. My parents split 3 different appetizers, while I got one sampler with 3 appetizers. My mother and I both reminded the waitress that my parents wanted the larger size, while I wanted the sampler. Food took a little while, no biggy, we were having fun! When the food did come out, we noticed my parents got the small sizes indicating a sampler, not what we ordered. We were given no appetizer plates, no extra napkins, and it took a while to flag down our waitress and ask if we were given the wrong sizes. She apologized, in which case my dad informed her since they were so small that he would like to order another appetizer since we were all kind of sharing it. We also asked for napkins and appetizer plates, which we never received. It was the last time we saw our waitress. I myself am 8 months pregnant, and had to nurse my water almost the whole meal. My mother eventually went up to the bar and asked for a refill of my drink. We had to sit and wait, again, to get our check to leave. During this time, I noticed serveral managers talking to each other, in front of customers, but not once did any of them check on the state of their restaurant or see how their customers were doing. The point of a manager being on the floor is to touch tables, engage with customers and make sure people leave happy. We did not! The 2 waitresses/bartenders that were taking care of us were doing their cut work so they could leave, almost completely ignoring their guests. They were so busy with trying to get out that their customer service was seriously lacking! A single gentleman in a booth beside us had his food dropped off and by the time we left not a single person had checked on him, though he was donel with his food and his beer and had been for some time. Not to mention my father was charged for the quesadillas he ordered. Again, being a server when our food came out wrong I would have gone up to a manager, told them the situation and had one of them check on the table. Since it was my fault, I would have seen if there was any that I could take something off the check or offer them a free desert.  I'm amazed that this location has received so many negative reviews and it appears the restaurant and corporate don't seem to care because nothing has been done to change it! They'd rather have their employees sitting down, managers standing around and everyone generally ignoring their customers than offering a pleasant dining experience. Message received Applebee's! I won't be coming back to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8?start=40,1.36,1.36,1.36,1.8960000000000001,1.36
65,Gina D.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,11,,1.0,2015-07-03,"My sister, my nephew, and I decided to go the the Frankford location (as we have a couple times a week since moving to TX a few weeks ago.) This particular time the waitress wasn't the best and messed our order up so I decided I no longer wanted my order as it was incorrect and just wanted to pay for my husband's to go order. She told me it would be better to get two orders of the bar size wings than one regular order so I listened to what she recommended. She must have forgotten she told me that and brought out 1 4 piece order. I told her that I wanted the 2 orders she suggested then asked if i could get them at once since it would be weird to eat 4 now and 4 in 15 minutes. She told me no she could not so i didnt want anything. The waitress decided to get the manager who came over and threw my order on the table with an attitude and walked away. I looked at the bill after he did this and asked our waitress get the manager to come back. He started to lie and say it was not possible to have 2 orders of wings as the waitress talked me into getting so she would have to bring them out separately. We were still calm and he just kept going with his disgusting attitude towards us. At this point I explained to him I haven't be rude to him and didn't appreciate the way he spoke to us. After he still said I could not take my meal off that had not been eaten/touched I told him that's all I was paying for when I got my cash out. We have never been treated so bad at a restaurant before And were beyond embarrassed  Our waitress Maddie and The manager Paul were horrible. I could understand his attitude of we were rude to him but to treat us like that and embarrass us by causing such a scene was more than uncalled for! Do not go here unless you like bad service (maybe its just at night as all other visits were during the day).

It seems the waitstaff was too busy dealing with regulars, larger parties than the two of us and birthdays. They sang the birthday song three times in the hour and a half that we were there. Finally our waiter stopped and asked if we had gotten our chips and salsa yet.  We replied with a no and he went and got them. Then about 5 minutes later our food was out. Is it wrong to enjoy an appetizer BEFORE your food arrives? The food looked alright. I ordered the smaller chicken fingers, fries and Honey Dijon. My partner ordered the Buffalo Wings and Blue Cheese dressing. Yet, none of the dipping sauces we ordered showed up. I noticed and i was turning around to get the girls attention who brought out the other (and this wasnt our waiter) and she turned away and left before I could. I guess she couldnt hear me over the birthday song being sung nearby. So again, we waited and waited. The food we had that was hot was now cold. We had to finally have another waiter get the manager for us. After waiting another amount of time, the manager finally comes over. We explain the situation to her.

Second my wife ordered a steak cooked medium and it came out like a hockey puck the first time so we sent it back. After 20 or so minutes later the waiter finally came over and told us they messed up the steak again and was making her another one. Finally the manager brought her a steak that was ok but not great.

32,Rhonda T.,"Carrollton, TX",29,4,,1.0,2016-10-29,"Went to Applebee's for my son's 16th birthday as it was his choice to go but was the most disappointing visit to a restaurant we have had as of late and a flop of a birthday dinner.  We will not be returning to this location or not too any Applebee's for that matter....they should take a place such as Cheddars as something to emulate as at Cheddars and places like it you get what you pay for in portion sizes and presentation. First off I ordered a Ginger Ale to drink and was told that there was no refills on that particular soda while there are refills on other sodas. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup and it was very subpar in what my idea of what Chicken Tortilla soup should be and corn seem to be the filler in this soup as there was way too much corn in relation to other parts of the soup. I asked for some crackers to have with the soup and they were extremely stale. As an appetizer ordered the chips and salsa and the size of that platter was even jaw dropping and the chips were way too greasy. My husband loves the Wonton Tacos BUT he ordered the two appetizer special and was disappointed to be told by the waiter that on the special you don't get the four wonton tacos but instead only three...so this is really no special deal at all, and the French Onion Soup was even smaller than the portion it should be....BEWARE!!! The specials are deceiving and are not really specials at all.  Being my son's birthday they said he could have a birthday dessert....it was the biggest joke I have ever seen as it was smaller than what a small kid's size portion would be....we are talking about a 230 lb 6'4 foot guy who ate it basically in one bite. My daughter ordered the brownie bite as well and the brownies in it were so hard I thought she may crack a tooth.....the portion size was so small that she even laughed. The presentation to these desserts are very unappealing in the way they come in the bowl as well. I am very disappointed in Applebee's and will not be returning as it was a real turn off and a huge disappointment. Spending $65.00 on a subpar meal was pretty disheartening as well. Corporate should be ashamed of themselves in the way they run their restaurant at the expense of their customers....only seeming to care more about turning tables than creating a wonderful food experience for the patron. I only wish that we had have made  a different choice as it was our son's 16th birthday and it was a very subpar experience to say the least........Oh and the bathroom could use some attention as my sandals stuck to the floor when trying to walk, toilet areas a mess and soap canisters broken, dirty sink and the list could go on....BAD BAD EXPERIENCE!!! APPLEBEE'S IS RAISING THEIR PRICES AND LOWERING THEIR PORTIONS. CORPORATE MAY THINK THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE IDIOTS BUT THEY ARE NOT AND CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT...YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE AS YOUR STAR RATING SAYS IT ALL.....SHAME ON YOU!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8?start=40,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.8280000000000003,1.92

Hubby got a 3 cheese pasta which was a good size bowl and was very yummy and we also got the spinach artichoke dip that came with some chips and a small cup of salsa. For dessert we got the triple chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream & whipped cream...yummm!!!All really enjoyable The drinks were okay not strong at all. I ordered the strawberry margarita and we also got a fireball whiskey which tasted good but again not strong. I would give it a 3 out of 10.

54,Larry C.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,2.0,2017-01-27,I have a lot of mixed feeling about this visit to Applebee's. The place was not busy so we were seated promptly however there was only one server taking care of 8 to 10 tables. we waited a few minutes before they took our drink order. Then a several more mi nutes before they took our food order.  The appetizer took so long that we were worried the would bring out our entries first. But the appetizer finally arrived and was hot and delishous. The entries arrived at the perfect time just as we finished. My wife loved her Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. I ordered the Butcher's Meats and Potato's but was rather disappointed. The potato's were flavorless. The large chunks of tomato overpowered everything and the grissle in the meat was inedible.

That being said there is a lot of take out. The places we do dine in at are very family friendly. Ie. Joe's Crab Shack in Lewisville with the playground, Sneaky Petes outdoor seating with the pool.   This was our 3rd time to get Applebee's takeout. Our order isn't correct. 1 meal was completely left out. I know mistakes happen. As usually, when I called to ask about it I was given an apathetic response.  No sincerity at all. Basically come back or we will give you something g next time. That's fair. But at least sound like you want to male it right. I've never spoken with anyone there that sounds happy to be there. No smiles through the phone. In December we decided to stop in for a cocktail before we met for a concert. It was 6 PM on a Thursday. The bar had maybe 8 people. No bartenders in sight. One of the ladies had a little dog IN HER LAP AT THE BAR. 15 minutes later a bartender walks in, takes our orders. Then the others orders...and serves us LAST. We immediately get the check, pay and their terminals are down. No credit cards. So we pay cash leave a tip and tell our group how shocking he visit was. October we got take put and they sent no condiments or silverware for a meal we provided for a school choir. But they did give us plenty across the street from the school at a different restaurant. So I feel comfortable with the 1.

So i ordered a strawberry and lime margarita & the frozen machine was down which i was really upset about because i only drink frozen margaritas. I tried one on the rocks and it tasted like juice so she made me another one but it tasted the same... maybe they ran out of liquor for the night lol (didn't ordered any food),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
5,Cedric J.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,5.0,2018-01-02,"Okay. We came here for cheap appetizers and $1 beers. We got everything we ordered and the waitress put up with our shit. If I didn't give 5 stars for that, then I should question my humanity. And also sweetheart, if you only drink frozen margaritas that cost $1, then a Yelp review is not necessary.

1,Kimberly M.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-09,"Ok, let me first start off by saying that I have NEVER written a bad review.. but with my last three experiences here being bad (with the first 2 only being mediocre) I feel the need to write a review to warn people. The first couple of times the food was great....that was a few years ago...but over the last 3 years the service and food at this location have been the WORST I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT ANY  RESTAURANT EVER!  My first bad experience started with dirty plates and super slow service...We had to find our own silverware, ketchup, etc., 2nd bad experience..again..dirty plates, dirty table, menu was gross and had food all over it from previous customers...ordered food and it came out super slow...when we cut into the boneless chicken wings they were completely raw...sent them back...they brought them out AFTER our entrees,  so we ended up taking them home! The entrees weren't even very good, my  grilled chicken breast tasted odd so I ended up only eating the side items. 3rd experience..I had gotten a gift card so I decided to try and give them ONE LAST CHANCE (since I was sick and didn't feel like driving or cooking)....we all ordered steak dinners. Went to pick them up at the curbside to go...Went inside..no one was around...finally heard a girl at the bar say ""I can help u over here."" I walked over and she immediately walked off and started talking to a man at the bar,  like I wasn't even there...I waited a few min, saw my order sitting beside me (without a ticket), searched through the bag, grabbed it and started to walk off.. I  said ""ok, thanks!"" ..heard her yell at me..""Umm, well, ok whatever!"".  I get our food home and it SUCKS!!! Our steaks are so tough we have to saw them with a knife (I can't say much since it is applebees and not a steak restaurant..but seriously this is REALLY BAD!) I will say that they cooked it accurately ...so there is that. However, the steak tasted like it had been fried  instead of grilled and it was beyond tough with a lot of gristle. The ""fresh"" garlic green beans were soggy like they were overcooked, fries were great, and the garlic mashed potatoes were great!  The spinach artichoke dip, that we had for an appetizer,...the dip was great , the chips were stale with over half of the largest chips being the size of a quarter!! Horrible service, horrible food quality....Don't waste your money or time going to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dallas-8,2.24,1.99,1.99,,2.0900000000000003
