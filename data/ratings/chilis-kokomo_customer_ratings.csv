4,Nathan D.,"Kokomo, IN",0,6,,4.0,2015-01-04,"I love Chilis! The service is pretty good 75% of the time. The food is affordable, but still great! I also love the ziosk on the tables. Makes paying my bill so much easier. You dont have to wait around on your server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kokomo,,,,,
3,Jeff P.,"Kokomo, IN",16,18,9.0,4.0,2015-07-27,"For the  restaurant category (Chain Restaurant), it's as good as it gets. Great food at this Kokomo location, only negative is the chips were a tad bit greasy and the guacamole could be a bit better. The steak was great with fresh and tasty broccoli, the mashed potatoes were good with cheese and onion chives. Talking about the food here has gotten me hungry...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kokomo,,,,,
0,Ruth C.,"Elizabeth, IN",10,88,5.0,5.0,2016-03-28,"Had a very good meal in the bar while we watched NCAA basketball.  Their Two for Twenty menu is quite extensive.  I had the chicken fajitas and hubby had the six ounce sirloin.  Appetizer of onion rings -- excellent!  My chicken was very good--tender and a good amount; however, the onions and peppers were not done enough for my liking.  I liked the guac and everything else.  Hubby said his steak was great, and he enjoyed his broccoli and mashed potatoes too. Service was good.  We enjoyed the game though not its outcome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kokomo,,,,,
1,Rod W.,"Oakley, MI",4,164,187.0,3.0,2016-10-14,We arrived just before they were getting busy on Saturday night. We were promptly seated and they had many severs so there was little wait. Time is money though and we felt a bit rushed. The food for the most part was delicious. The steak did lack seasoning and flavor and was more well done than medium well. The chicken quesadillas were perfect. The drink was EXPENSIVE and not worth the $9.  We would stop back but would avoid the wine and get the steak cooked medium instead of medium well,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kokomo,,,,,
2,John F.,"Kokomo, IN",0,27,15.0,3.0,2017-06-05,"Stopped in early evening for a light dinner ordered two signature salads. Was happy with the meal but being one of two couples in the place you would have thought it wouldn't have taken a half hour to get our salads. Otherwise, we enjoyed the time spent here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kokomo,,,,,
