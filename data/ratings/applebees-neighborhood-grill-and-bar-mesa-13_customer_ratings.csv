43,Ashlie H.,"Mesa, AZ",706,292,239.0,2.0,2013-02-13,"Not so happy, happy hour at this Applebee's.  Happy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it. Im sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door. *Currently looking for a happy, happy hour place*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

First off let me start out by saying we had a $10 buck gift card and that is really what prompted the visit.  I ordered the clubhouse grill with no bacon. It has turkey and ham with a BBQ sauce. I wasn't expecting it to be a melt but it hit the spot. Managed to take a picture.  That and fries with two sides of ranch and I was in heaven. My husband had the endless soup and salad lunch special. First up for him was French onion soup and a spinach and shrimp salad. Next the chilly and an Asian chicken salad. Both were great and although we had not planned on getting desert our awesome waitress who filled my water glass a million times without me noticing talked us into brownie bites for 99 cents. So cute these small triangle brownies and one scoop of ice cream. I wish I would have remembered my camera.

44,Greg M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,196,19.0,1.0,2013-08-28,"August 27, 2013  5:15pm. I ordered the 7 oz sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The veggies were fine, so was the service. The water in my glass was nasty metallic tasting. My steak was easily the worst meat I've ever been served in my life. It was an odd looking long banana-shaped thing that did not taste like beef at all. Maybe it was goat or horse but IT WAS NOT BEEF. It sort of tasted like the jerked goat burgers I had in Jamaica. I've been eating beef my entire life, this tasted nothing like, looked nothing like, and had the consistency nothing like any beef I've ever had, in my life. Don't think I'll be going back there. Ever. I did not want to complain at the store because there is no coming back from being served a piece of meat like this, it should have never been served to a human customer. Complaining only jeopardizes your safety in any restaurant. Never send food back to the kitchen for replacement is my philosophy. We simply cut short our visit and got the hell out without saying a word. I'll express my displeasure by never returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006
22,Elorie K.,"Mesa, AZ",172,4,,1.0,2013-12-10,"Let me first say that this is a review of this restaurant in particular, on this specific evening, not overall of Applebee's.  We come to this Applebee's several times a month, whether it be for late night happy hour or for Kid's Eat Free on Tuesdays. Mostly on Kids eat free Tuesdays. I'm a single mom and on a budget, so we go a couple of Tuesdays a month and I will get a half price appetizer and a drink and my son will eat for free a $3.99 kids meal. It's a great deal when both of us eat for $10 including tip. Not tonight, though. Although I've never had an issue before, my bill came back and I made the server aware that my son's meal was not taken off. He said he'd speak with his Manager. The manager, Jamie, came over and was confrontational from the start. She stated that this is a business and that I can't have my son's meal for free because that just doesn't make sense because his meal is the same price as mine. She said that it was free with an Entree and that the sign out side said so and that I could go check. I let her know that I wasn't aware that the policy had changed since the last time we'd been and that I had to order an entree (which I've never had to do in the past).  She continued to say that I'm lying that I've been before on Tuesdays because she does inventory and she's here every Tuesday. She continued on in front of other patrons stating that this is a business that needs to make money. I paid, left embarrassed and will probably never return to this Applebee's again, if any. Our server was a doll, the food was just ok as usual, but the nightmare of this manager was enough to say no thank you to ever returning.  As I was leaving, I checked the sign outside, and of course there is no mention of ""free with purchase of Entree"" anywhere on the building. Sooo I took a picture to post of that sign too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=40,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

47,Leonard P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,5,,3.0,2014-02-24,"I went here to have a quick sit down at the bar and a bite with a friend at the bar. I expected to have a relatively good time, but little did I know the bar was being hosted that night by the Ice Queen. Cold treatment from this host from the moment we first ordered our beers, complete with being chided over my perfectly valid ID, to having to ask for a menu after waiting quite some time (instead of being asked if we wanted food, like most bartenders would??) so we could even get the food we came for! When the food came, the wings looked like someone had quite literally emptied a sauce bottle over them - they were sitting in a puddle! Never had to dip a wing 4-5 times in ranch just to get some on it before! At least the Quesadilla was tasty, though I really didn't appreciate being disagreed with by the bartender about leaving off the Pico de Gallo. Tomatoes make me violently sick, I don't need your bloody opinion about them being on the dish! Thankfully, an otherwise infuriating experience was mostly rectified by the bubbly friendliness of the waiter who came to send the previous bartender on a break. The replacement and her friendly, happy demeanor is probably the main reason why I didn't simply walk out. While I still rushed my dinner (and my friends) so we could get the heck out of dodge, it was a relief to see that the first employee wasn't a wholly accurate example of the staff. Primarily for that reason I'm willing to give three stars, unlike the one or two I angrily wanted to. I hope my experience with the staff to be a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

We came here because it's cheap and they have basic menu items to accommodate some of the pickier members in our party of 6. The hostess' make it clear that they hate their jobs. No smile. No sense of humor. Just cold miserable stares.  For an appetizer we ordered 2 orders of Mozzarella Sticks that came too cold on the inside. It was like eating a string cheese fresh out of the fridge.  It took 46 minutes for our main course to arrive. 46 minutes to make 3 steaks, 1 sandwich, a bowl of French Onion soup, and a burger.

10,Gene T.,"Mesa, AZ",4507,484,228.0,4.0,2016-03-14,"I like Applebee's. It's my wife's favorite restaurant. I go for we go there. You get two entrees and an appetizer to split. Tonight we got the 2 for 20. Mine was the quesadilla burger, hers was the chicken tenders. The order came with French fries. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with nacho chips. As always the dip was good. Creamy and smooth, almost want to just eat it with a spoon good. I ordered the quesadilla burger which was my first time ordering this. This is a hamburger wrapped in a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications. It was sandwiched in a quesadilla composed of melted cheese, Pico de Gallo. and grilled flour tortilla. It was a good burger. The only thing that would have made it a 5 star burger would have been chipotle or taco seasoning on the burger. As it was it was a little bland. I got some Tabasco to spice it up a little. The fries were crispy not soggy. I hate soggy.  The service was excellent. It was a full house tonight and Samantha was right there servicing out table as if we were the only ones there. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. This one is a keeper in my book giving it a 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
4,Hillary T.,"Mesa, AZ",133,156,78.0,4.0,2016-03-14,"I have always liked Applebee's. From their food to the service it's definitely deserves a 4 star rating in my book. My husband and I stopped for supper tonight. Tonight was burger night, that meant you could get any burger and fries for $6.99. As enticing as that sounded we decided to order off the 2 for $20 menu. You get one appetizer and certain menu choices for 20 dollars. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips. This dip is so good. Warm and creamy. The entree I chose was the chicken tenders and fries. It comes with your choice of ranch, honey mustard or bbq sauce. I chose the honey mustard. The chicken strips are good, the breading is lightly seasoned. The fries are crispy, but over salted and seasoned for my taste. The honey mustard sauce is thick, creamy and not too sweet. It's perfect. The service is great. Tonight the place was busy, but our server never faltered on checking on us and making sure we were taken care of. I will be back as this is one of my favorite restaurants,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
5,Haeley R.,"Mesa, AZ",4,15,157.0,2.0,2016-03-16,"The restaurant itself was nice, and the service was pretty okay (they were fantastic at keeping drinks refilled!), but the food was a complete bust. The mozzarella sticks were bland and the sauce was a really weird flavor. The spinach and artichoke dip was ATROCIOUS, had no texture, and tasted like broccoli. I ordered the fiesta lime chicken, and it was a reheated nightmare. The sauce on the chicken was too salty, and the melted cheese had hardened on top of the chicken. The only thing that made it lime chicken was the tiny slice of lime on the side. I also could have done without the huge nest of soggy chips underneath the chicken, which was the majority of the dish.  The Spanish rice was also dry, looked old, and was pretty bland.  Overall, it was a disappointment, and it's a good thing we had a giftcard, otherwise I would not have wanted to pay for this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

19,Mandy A.,"Glendale, AZ",153,6,,1.0,2016-11-10,"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour around 10PM. As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was pretty dull and empty. There was maybe another 10 people in the entire restaurant. We waited to be seated for about a good 7 minutes and absolutely no one greeted us. Then after we sat ourselves, we sat at our table talking for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone approached us at our table (we have no been in the restaurant about 20ish minutes with no one attempting to welcome or assist us) - reminding you that it was not busy in the slightest. Eventually, it got to the point where we pushed the ""Call Server"" button on the little table kiosk and she still didn't come for another 5 minutes. I look over toward the rear of the restaurant and all the waitresses, other than the bartender, were sitting down in a booth talking and not responding to their tables. Finally, we are helped, but the service continues to be just as poor. The waitress brought us our drinks and our food slowly and after that she visited our table once, and it still was not busy so we should've been a piece of cake for her to handle. My boyfriend and I both work in jobs that require exceptional customer service and know how terrible it is to get a bad review on your store location and typically we wouldn't post one, but I never had worse service than I have with this experience. Every other Applebee's I've been to has always done really amazing! So I'm sad to say that this location wasn't up to par standards. Definitely won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
15,Craig H.,"Clarkdale, AZ",1,94,4.0,1.0,2016-12-02,"I want to start by saying I had emailed a very detailed review to the email on my Applebee's receipt over a week ago, still no response, so now it goes on YELP. This was the worst Thanksgiving Dinner/meal I've ever had.  We took my mother last year to this same location, it was $14.99, wonderful, tasty meal.  This year it was $11.99 (which I didn't find out until we walked in) this should have been a tipoff.  The turkey was chopped up, re-heated and dried out, the stuffing (at least I think that's what it was) was 2 small ice-cream scoops of glop, the mashed potatoes were okay, the green beans were okay (a bit garlicky), and instead of cranberry sauce (get this) there were about 7 chopped/dried cranberries sprinkled throughout the plate.  The gravy consisted of a few drips and drabs here and there.  I cannot believe the chef here would take the time to serve this crap for a Thanksgiving meal. A better meal would be served to the homeless...no kidding.  Well, I could go on how the servers looked like they were ready for a football game (wearing their jerseys) instead of last year how they were nicely dressed and FRIENDLY greeting at the front door.  If you're not going to serious about serving a special meal, don't bother at all. BTW, I would have paid even more than $14.99 for something quality, befitting what one would expect for Thanksgiving. If you dine at this location other than a Holiday meal, it is good. (see, something positive)  We occasionally eat here with my Mother who lives just down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

18,Ti L.,"Mesa, AZ",70,8,,3.0,2017-02-06,So excited to visit one of my favorite places and I have officially been let down again. Not by the food but by the service. While waiting 15 minutes to even order drinks at a time where it isn't that busy we were barley acknowledged. When we were approached by what  I believe to be the manager she was nice enough and we ordered everything at that point.  When our server finally approached us her attitude was OK until we told her we already  put our order in. From there she walks off and groups together with two other younger girls who then turn to look at my table. Just not very professional. Food comes and there are things wrong but we hate to complain so we just proceeded to eat. Food actually was really good they just forgot the bacon on the all-in burger. Not a big deal. I asked for more oriental dressing cause it's awesome and when she brought it back she tosses on table and says here you go girl. At that point I decided she will not receive a tip from me. She was short and rude even though I maintained being a lady I was offended. I am in the service industry dealing with hair which you get all types of clients and situations that challenge your character.

When I complain in a nice way my waiter took my meal back to the kitchen and the other two people in my party pretty much had their dinner done by the time my food finally came back.   and when it came back it was piping hot and very good.   I was thinking that the manager would come over because I had to send my food back or that the server would comp  my meal or give us a free dessert none of that happened    pretty disappointing.  We will not go back to Applebee's at all especially this one,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I am a busy professional and I eat out quite frequently. I placed my order. As always, my order was not on time. (When I placed my order online I was given a time it would be ready ) I waited a good 10minutes before I was acknowledged. I received my order in another 15minutes. I get home and I find out that they messed up my order. Mind you it's 115 degrees outside and I live about 15-20min away. I call the store to speak with a manager. She offered to remake my meal and I would travel to go pick it up or she could report it to Corporate and they would send me something. It was hot out and I was tired. I opted for Corporate to send me something. I received two $5 coupons. The audacity...the insult!! I am sure I spent close to $40 on my order. The $5 coupon is a slap in the face!
