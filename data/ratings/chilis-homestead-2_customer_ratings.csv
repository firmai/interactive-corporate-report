First of all, I called to place a to-go order. I was on hold almost 10 minutes before someone finally picked up to take my order. The guy who I spoke with was clueless about the menu and what was included in the items I ordered and I had to read word-for-word from the online menu (the online menu was not working to place orders which is why I had to call). When we went to pick up the order, there was a sign at the to-go station saying to pick up orders at the bar, which is fine, except that there was no one tending the bar area and the servers just kept walking past us without any offer to help. Finally the bartender came out but instead of going to get our order immediately, she first took time to flirt (almost making out) with one of the servers...just what I want while I'm waiting for my food. She brought it out and handed me the bill and took my credit card payment and walked away before taking back my signed copy. My husband tried to hand it to a server as I did not feel comfortable just leaving it unattended at the bar area and the server took it and left it right at the bar area where I did not want to leave it.

The food was average for a chilis no major complaints there, but the service was horrible.  We sat down in the bar area and waited almost 10 mins for our drink order to be placed, then it was probably another 10 mins or so for drinks (2 beers) to come out. Also I made a rookie mistake and didn't ask for him to wait to bring out the second beer and since they were 2 for 1, the second one sat there getting hot.  After drinks we ordered the new table side guacamole and it was lacking. The server put probably 7 ingredients in but when you tasted it you could only taste mashed up avocado.  Once we finally got our food it was room temp at best. The chicken tenders tasted like they had been fried much early and were kind of tough.  Will I be back ... Maybe.

Restaurant is clean and looks modern, server was very attentive and the best part and why I gave it 2 stars. I ordered the Classic Sirloin with grilled avocado which is part of their lighter choices menu at 410 calories. My son ordered a plain Craft burger with cheese and fries. Hubby ordered the fresh mex pairings with 3 sides.No appetizer and just 3 sodas. The food came out in a fair amounf of time but the food was just not very good. My son's burger was the best of the 3 meals and it's a burger. My food was just blah and after I finished I got a slight queez feeling and I think the combination of garlic and tomato was too much. Hubby said his food was flavorless and just not very good. I tasted the beans and rice and agreed. The rest tasted like bad tex mex and just no love in the food.  Unfortanely we won't be back anytime soon. We did have a gift card so that was a plus since the meal was essentially free but I would avoid this unless you want appetizers and drinks since it seemed they had a lot of buy 1 get 1 free.

Recently the past 5-6 visits have all gone as normal as can be expected with good service. Overall I think its pretty cool they are amping up there tex mex menu and adding some pretty cool authentic mexican plates in. We tried the table side hand made guac with bacon and chips and it was a pretty cool experience. Our waitress brought everything out and literally made the guac in front of us which is something we've seen at local mexican restaurants with the guac and salsa. So it was cool to see her do it.  I went with the bbq ribs and shrimp combo with their loaded mash (which I love) and the corn on the cob. Everything came out pretty quick and was hot. Pretty much once we where done with the guac and chips the food was ready for us. Are waitress was very nice and got all our stuff right away. I have had some pretty shitty luck with getting waiters and waitress on their first day so it was relieving to get someone with knowledge of the menu!  Only thing I hate about this chilis is its a dead spot for your AT&T cell phone. They also do not have wifi available so if someone is dying you wont know till after lunch or dinner lol.
