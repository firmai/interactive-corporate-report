25,Michelle A.,"Lafayette Hill, PA",2,11,,5.0,2012-03-15,"Have been to this location a few times since moving to the area. Marshall was our server this past visit-- the best. Awesome, awesome service and a nice guy to talk to. My drink never went empty and he was efficient as can be with the table needs.  I would ask to sit in his section again for great, quick service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal?start=20,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001
19,Foodie D.,"Linden, VA",4,43,3.0,2.0,2013-06-20,"This place blows but the drinks are cheap, so...... It's pretty redneck and white trash with a splash of wannabe thug life thrown in. Whether it's the 1st or the 16th of the month. Or when the welfare check clears, you'll usually find the best Front Royal in there :) You'll know when you see a bunch of cheap American cars in the parking lot with baby seats in them, but no kids inside. Or they go ahead and bring the kids inside the bar area, nice!   The bartenders are nice, but to be honest, they've been too long. It's kinda boring, the same bartenders every single damn visit. That place needs new blood behind the bar. And I notice every other week I go in, there's a batch of new teenage girl servers each time. Along with a random trailer park trash dude sitting at the end of the bar who gets the the occasional visit from the said teenage girl. Boy, her dad must be proud! I've been to plenty of TGI Fridays around VA and this place is Springer. It's just the town. Not fault to TGI Fridays. Just look at the pictures people posts. Enough said....... The one in Winchester is pretty cool! Live music, plenty of bar staff, and a dude walking around doing magic tricks! The clientele is more upscale also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
26,Wayne S.,"Edinburg, VA",1,257,,3.0,2013-09-07,Came in early on a Saturday evening but was seated quickly.  The server was quick and efficient.  I ordered the Buffalo Boneless Wings and they were actually pretty good.  I then got a Tennessee BBQ Sandwich which again was pretty good.  Not a bad dinner at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
18,Heather U.,"Herndon, VA",8,33,,2.0,2013-10-18,"Well, no. I've had a house in Front Royal for about 9 years, and I've only visited Friday's once and I have no intention of going back.  The truth is, I knew better before that one visit, but we had been painting and doing yard work all day and wanted a quick meal.  My husband and I visited with my father and my 18-month-old toddler. Note to every server in the world (and it is an absolute shame that a family-friendly restaurant does not know this): when parents order a children's meal, ask if that should be served ASAP.  And if parents tell you to bring out the kid's meal first, it is absolutely in your best interest to do so. I felt the need to make the above note because after we ordered our meal, it took just shy of an hour to actually get our food.  Ah...not entirely true.  I ordered an appetizer as a meal, asked for it to be served with the rest of the meal, and it was served about 10 minutes later.  :-\    My son's meal was served AFTER the rest of the the food was served.  I actually had to ask for it twice, and it was STILL not brought out.  When it DID finally arrive, they served the children's mean in a scalding HOT bowl.  Seriously?!!  gosh, next time I should bring my attorney!  (Kidding, there will never be a next time.)  Oh yeah, the table next to us who arrived 20 minutes after we did received our food before us.  Not a good sign.   My father's food was served cold.  I sent it back....and they microwaved it.  Literally, I look at his pasta and made note of the arrangement.  The server took it back, and two minutes later brought it back.  She claimed they ""retossed it"" but the truth is that they just nuked it.  She swore they did not, and man, do I hate when servers blatantly lie to you (and yes, I am 100% positive the pasta was nuked).   NEVER microwave food that was served cold (it is different if the customer lets it go cold but NOT if the kitchen does).  Remake it...it's freaking pasta, not a beef wellington!  It takes a minute. I had to take my son out while my father and husband finished their meal because he was too restless after all that time waiting.  He never even ate his food since it was too hot when it finally did arrive.  We asked to speak to the manager, who looked at me like I had two heads when I explained my discontent.  She gave us a discount, but we did pay for both my son's and my father's meal, which is completely unacceptable.  They never offered to remake the cold food. Why two stars and not one?  I really, really like the pretzel roll appetizer.  Also, normally when my toddler makes a mess (food on floor, beverage on table) we clean it up and then excessively guilt tip to make up for it.  This time I did not make up for the mess and noise with a tip...so the extra star is my ""guilt tip"".  Truth is....this place earned one star or less.  Yeah, I know, it's just a Friday's.  But every restaurant needs SOME standards, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
23,Phil H.,"Stephens City, VA",0,5,,2.0,2013-11-25,"Food was sub-par, service less than average and management was invisible.

8,Adrianna C.,"San Antonio, TX",89,318,482.0,4.0,2014-04-02,"Pleasantly surprised by how good the food was here. I am usually disappointed in most restaurant chains like this and it's been a long time since I went to a Friday's, but the food was really good, reasonably priced, very clean establishment and great service. I look forward to going back!  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken  ""a sauteed chicken breast basted with caesar vinaigrette dressing, then finished with a parmesan crust topping. served with three-cheese tortelloni tossed in spinach alfredo sauce and a side of our fresh tomato mozzarella salad.""  My only complaint was that the side of tortellini pasta was cold, but that's my only complaint! We did go at an odd time, at like 2 pm and we were one of the very few people there. I think there were only one or two other customers. So maybe avoid going at a busy time and you will have good experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
12,Jodie C.,"Warrenton, VA",29,436,1320.0,4.0,2014-09-24,"It's funny to see the locals giving this a one star. I can understand though. Like my local Applebee's...I'll go anywhere BUT there. Other people like it. I guess it's like that here. I don't have a TGIF near my house. I went to this one driving thru town one time with my kids. We stopped and ate. We loved it. Bacon cheeseburgers were so good. And my son liked his chicken fingers. yeah, i know anyone can make a burger and chicken fingers right? Anyway, our server was really nice and we enjoyed ourselves. Wish we had one in Warrenton.(wink wink)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
10,Randy A.,"Yuma, AZ",4,18,24.0,5.0,2014-10-13,"I was on business in Front Royal for a couple of months just recently staying at the Hampton Inn. Nearby I found TGIFridays. I was alone so say at the bar.  The bar tenders treated me like gold and made me feel welcome as if I was in my own house.  The food, wine selection and Draft beer they had was excellent. This place quickly became my home away from home.  Thank you Angel,  Erica and Yolonda and manager Heather.  Some day I'll be back to see ya'll if I ever get Bach East.  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
21,rob w.,"Linden, VA",0,24,,1.0,2014-11-25,"Not clean at all. My visit nov. 24 , 2014 at 7pm. Floors were very sticky , bathrooms unclean, used paper towels on floor. Menus, covered with stains, sticky, gross. Food took very long about 40 minutes to receive after orders placed. Temperature of food was not hot , it was warm on top like it had been sitting under a heat lamp ? Orders were correct ! Very little attention from waitress. Not much quality control processes for a chain restaurant !!!!... Needs work...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal?start=20,,,,,

15,John R.,"Chantilly, VA",5,10,,5.0,2015-02-21,Ended up getting stuck in front royal due to snow so we decided to grab a bite to eat. One guy at the bar was very rowdy . We where at first concerned with what kind of resturant we were at. Then to our surprised the bartender stepped in cut the guy off who wasn't very happy . I would like to say her name was Tracy but I'm not exactly positive . She held her ground very professionally.  The couple was eventually kicked out . I can say we had a great time afterwards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
24,Morgan G.,"Linden, VA",0,17,,2.0,2015-07-10,"First of all, the service we received was not an issue. Our waitress was sweet and efficient enough. The manager went around and checked on everyone and listened to me when I made my complaint (which I'll explain later) and agreed with me. Whether she actually agreed with me or not I don't care, clearly she understands customer service. Secondly, EXCELLENT drinks for a decent price. :)  But the food.... Oh dear lord, the food. Who in the world thinks this crap up and slaps a price tag on it then thinks its acceptable to mass produce? I decided on the nacho's (appetizer) for my meal. I MISREAD the menu, I admit. What was delivered to me literally looked like diarrhea on a plate. There were a bout a half dozen HALVED TACO SHELLS laid out with refried beans shmeared on them with one jalapeno pressed on top of each... a little shredded cheese melted on top, ramekins of guac, sour cream, and salsa in the middle. The taco shells were burnt black. I took one bite because the delicious Long Island made me do it.... I asked where the meat was and the manager said ""it's blended with the beans"". GAG!   My daughters meal was passable and my boyfriends tolerable. Clearly the kitchen staff didn't take a ton of pride in their work but they clearly don't have much to work with.  We rarely eat at chain restaurants but wanted to give it a whirl for fun. We knew better. They did not charge for my nasty tacos that I sent back and were very apologetic.  I won't go back for a meal but maybe some French fries and a drink...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal?start=20,,,,,

Let's see what happens.  It took forever to get the initial order!! My wife ordered the strawberry vinaigrette salad, later they came back to say they were out of strawberries!  (Offered 20% off) seems like they are always out of some ingredient of a food order! Place seems to be on a downhill slide  Follow up,  the very nice manager  came to our table, and took care of our bill, and sincerely apologized for all the problems.  Great customer relations. We will be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
17,John L.,"Front Royal, VA",0,15,,2.0,2015-08-07,"Overpriced for it is. Food was meh, service was good. Wait staff was pushing the Overpriced apps, at $10 per person you might as well get an entree.

11,Luara C.,"Warrenton, VA",9,60,8.0,1.0,2015-11-14,"The service at this location has dropped significantly.  Recently visited this location on sat 11/15 and it was horrible!  We came in with a party of 4 around 3 pm.  We received our appetizer with no plates or silverware, when we asked, it took approx 7 minutes to receive it.  The food finally came out and was wrong, fries were cold, etc.  zero stars if possible",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
14,Heather N N.,"Bealeton, VA",6,1,,5.0,2015-12-24,I have been to this particular Friday's twice and both times have been great. They have the best employees.

16,Amber L.,"Linden, VA",0,58,3.0,3.0,2016-04-21,I feel like service here is a hit or miss. I typically do not pick to eat here. Great prices on apps but I feel the meals are a bit pricey for what they are and taste. It seems to be packed everytime I go with loud music.

13,Penny S.,"Edinburg, VA",4,7,,1.0,2016-07-01,"NASTY. Tables are sticky. Menus were also sticky. Waitresses make you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order. If you are a group of slightly drunken men, the service is much better. The prices are ridiculous for the quality and quantity of food. Last time we were there, we ordered the pretzels and cheese sauce appetizer. Pretzels were decent but the sauce was cold and lumpy with chunks of unmelted cheese. We usually enjoy this chain but this location is the worst. Never going here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,,,,,
6,David G.,"Sunset Beach, NC",6,2,,2.0,2016-08-11,"Food was poor. Service was slow. Wi-Fi was fine.  I got th lunch Cobb salad. It was a tiny side salad for$8. Crap. Dressings tasted rancid.  My friend got jack sliders with a Caesar side. Fries were cool and tasteless. Caesar was drenched in dressing and inedible.

I keep coming back because it's delicious and their reward program saves you tons of money. The Front Royal location however, will always make you wish you drove to Winchester instead. The staff will always argue with you about a coupon you have so don't plan on using it.

1,Travis C.,"Haymarket, VA",43,7,1.0,1.0,2017-11-03,"This meal was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. This place hasn't been very impressive, probably why they sent out the coupons that we used for this visit. They were advertising there new ribs.. claiming to be better than before.  We both got the ribs.... I'm pretty sure I just ate charcoal, couldn't even eat them. The service was terrible... Never got a refill until we were waiting on the check, never stopped to ask us how the meal was. I did stop the manager to show her my dehydrated burnt pork ribs...she asked me if I wanted her to box them up for a snack later... why would I want to box them up when I'm clearly not eating them??

0,Joshua H.,"Winchester, VA",0,38,,3.0,2017-12-23,"Solid. That's the word. Nothing special. Burgers are okay. Everything is okay. That's kind of the bittersweet thing about this place: nothing sucks, but nothing is great.  The service varies. Of course, it depends on what server you get. Some are efficient, some are over-attentive, and some could care less.  The atmosphere is cool. They play a lot of trendy, alternative/indie music.  The prices are okay. You'll spend $11-$20 per person. This place is a better bar than restaurant. Eh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-front-royal,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
