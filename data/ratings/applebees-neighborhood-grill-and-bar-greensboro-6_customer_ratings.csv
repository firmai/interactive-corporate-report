13,Lane C.,"Brunswick, NC",4,33,5.0,5.0,2012-07-08,"I can't really think of anything bad to say about this applebees restaurant.  The food was perfect, wait staff was great, and there were tv's everywhere waiting for your eyes to view them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
12,Lauren V.,"Greensboro, NC",2,3,,5.0,2014-07-18,"Our server Dominic was fantastic! We shared the perfect margarita; perfect size for sharing with someone. I was able to order my steak (serloin) extra rare and it came out just how I like it! I've been here several times, since I live in the area, but tonight was exceptionally good. My mom had the fiesta lime chicken and said it was fantastic; it's what she always orders. The manager came by to make sure everything was great, and she was really nice. I like this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
14,Ethan H.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,2.0,2014-12-07,"our food tasted good but the portions were very small.  also, we ordered the salmon and it was raw inside.  even when we mentioned it to the wait staff nothing was done about it.  in fact all they did was refill our drinks once and then bring the check.  poor value and service, id rather have gone down the street to the local diner...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
8,T K.,"Greensboro, NC",1,94,20.0,1.0,2015-06-29,"For a Monday evening, service was attentive, but not great - had to reorder a beer twice before actually getting it, and had to ask twice for napkins and condiments.   Our Sam Adams Summer Ale, at $4.50 a pop, definitely did not taste like it should have, more like cheap Bud. Pot stickers were extremely hard and the cheese sticks were small, but okay.     Ribs were fair - easily pulled apart, but very dry (hence the second beer), charred on the ends and underneath.  Definitely not worth the $17.99 for a ""full"" rack (must have been a very small pig). Pepper Crusted Sirloin with Whole Grain had to be sent back.  Meat was undercooked and extremely tough - gray in color and looked like pieces of plastic. A tasteless dish, but the description sounded good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
6,Jessica J.,"Greensboro, NC",79,79,68.0,4.0,2015-07-14,"So we went around happy hour time and got quite happy. I ordered an entire meal and a slew of drinks... well, I left my full meal in a take out plate (in its entirety lol I had more of a liquid diet in mind). Two blocks away I realize and called back... they tell me they'll hold it for me. It takes me all of 2 mins to get back and THEY'VE THROWN IT AWAY! despite having turn around to retrieve it. ... NO worries. They gently explained that there were two server by the same name & and the wrong one was informed to hold the food. They made me an entire new meal on the house! *********************** However, they haven't quite grasped carside to go.  The site asks you for all this vehicle info and you still have to call them and remind them your outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
10,Whitney B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,2,,2.0,2015-10-17,"Food was mediocre at best. I could have made better at home. Service was AWFUL! Server Justin, must have been going for the slowest moving server award. Well he won. He only had 2 tables and the restaurant was dead. We had to remind him to bring us our drinks AFTER we got our appetizers, my food was cold, my mom received the wrong sides and when she asked for the correct one, she was charged for it, she asked for fries, that isnt an upcharge. Manager was very polite and tried to rectify the situation, but we won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
11,J N.,"Greensboro, NC",40,33,,1.0,2016-01-27,I decided to give them another go. They got my order wrong. They didn't apologize. They blamed a coworker. I had to wait 10 extra minutes. The portion size was decreased from my last visit. A sauce container was used for chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
7,Nick D.,"Greensboro, NC",50,50,20.0,1.0,2016-11-03,"I am writing this yelp a few days after my visit to this awful eatery in order to let my thoughts be sorted out. First of all I would like to highlight certain aspects of this restaurant that must be addressed. When we arrived at a peak dinner hour of 6:45, the restaurant was surprisingly empty. I immediately demanded we call off dinner however I was convinced to stay and boy was that a mistake. By the time we ordered our food the waitress had already made many stupid mistakes. For example it took me a solid 3 Minutes to explain my order to the waitress. Three minutes. I ordered chicken fingers without honey mustard. And during our meal the one I was dining with ordered a salad that had various toppings including corn and beans. However to my great surprise they screwed it up. It had neither beans nor corn. Now as a customer who demands good service, I kid you not I called to her twice as she walked by and she literally ignored me. I know this because I can read people and I noticed her turn her head slightly when I Called for her but she kept going. Finally when she checked up on us I explained the issue and this ""smart"" waitress decided to compensate by bringing a little cup full of beans and corn. Might I remind you this was at the end of our flippin meal. So I decided to maybe help this woman out by explaining how a bowl of corn and beans does not do jack sh*t after the rest of the salad has been eaten. But it's ok because she gave us %5 off the ticket for a $30.00 dinner. All in all the service sucked, my tenders tasted like a breaded piece of garbage, and I now hate this restaurant. I recommend everyone else do a public service and let this place close so we can get a new restaurant on battleground!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
9,Tim M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,16,,1.0,2016-12-21,We arrived at around 6:00PM on a Wednesday. We got seated right away and the hostess took our drink order. She said our server would be with us but after a few minutes she came back and took our order. While we were waiting they turned away dozens of customers telling them that they were short of servers. They had two hostesses. One was helping serve some. The other was doing absolutely nothing but walking around drinking a drink and hacking cough. The food was good once we got it. We had to ask for refills and extra napkins that we had requested when we ordered. When we tried to checkout with kiosk the bill was wrong. They double billed us for salad. It took 15 minutes to finally get it corrected and pay bill. We were in the restaurant over an hour and a half. This is the absolutely worst managed restaurant that I've ever been to. Short of help and bad help. One waiter was trying his best but others not so much. I was amazed at how many customers were turned away and how many left because they were frustrated. Hostesses were encouraging them to leave. They definitely need a manager.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
5,Michael K.,"Blacksburg, SC",292,10,,3.0,2017-05-15,When I dine in I sit at the bar and I would give that 5 stars due to the service. The bartenders are great and the food is delicious and drinks are amazing.  The reason for the 3 stars is because the Take-Out is worth 1 star.  I have now tried Take-Out twice and both times there was an issue.  First time I ordered the condiments was missing. I ordered a salad and they forgot dressing as well as silverware. Sorry but dry lettuce is not my favorite. I called the restaurant and the girl said she wasn't surprised because the guy working has made a few other mistakes that night. She said a manager would call me in the morning. I never got a call. That's okay though because I really didn't want anything for free but shows the level of concern with follow up. I was just notifying them of the error so that maybe that employee will slow down next time and review the order.  Tonight I tried again (it's been a couple months) and the same guy was working. This time the order I placed online I think was forgotten about or wasn't even noticed because I got there at the time the website told me the food would be completed and the food was another 15 min past the scheduled time.  Both issues are not major issues and mistakes happen but I'm 0 for 2 for take-out so I would recommend dining in.  That's what I'll be doing for now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
1,Robert Y.,"Greensboro, NC",497,377,267.0,2.0,2017-08-11,"Yesterday was my first time ever eating at Applebee's. Oh man, do I want to give this place a great rating based on the food alone. However I can't. So let me explain. As I said, the food here is fantastic, though I recently heard they overhauled their menu not too long ago so expect surprises if you knew this place years ago. We ordered the pretzel and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, I got the French Onion soup (because of course I had to get it. All of it was great. As entrees we ordered lemon chicken and caprese chicken. Both dishes were delicious. The chicken was perfect great tasting and a little bit juicy. Really fantastic food. The problem, unfortunately, is the service. Looking back, I should have known something was up from the moment we entered the restaurant since we arrived at 6:00 on a Thursday night and there was hardly anyone there. What followed was an exercise in patience. We were immediately greeted by our waiter who took our drinks with no issues at all. However after we ordered our food, things took a slow turn. Our appetizers took a long time to arrive and our entrees were served not too long after, which resulted in our having a very messy table that made it difficult to eat, a difficulty compounded by the fact that our waiter struggled to take the empty dishes off of our plate and fill our glasses with water. Additionally, my soup was not served with a spoon and although our waiter told me that he was getting it, it took a while and I had to go retrieve one myself. Finally, it took forever to get the check. Very frustrating. While it may seem I am complaining a lot about my waiter, I must note that I thought he was great. He seemed to be doing a lot of things. The problem is that he and one other person seemed to be the only ones serving the customers at the time, and while the place wasn't too busy, it would have been difficult for only 2 people to handle.  Ironically, I saw in the news the same night, that they were closing 100 US Applebees stores in the near future. I hope this place can turn its service around because I loved my visit otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
2,Savannah B.,"Greensboro, NC",55,12,25.0,5.0,2017-09-26,"I love this Applebee's. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. The food is amazing, not too pricey, and they don't take forever preparing it! They have nice music playing in the background, and the temperature isn't too cold or hot. It's a family friendly environment. I would definitely recommend going here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
4,Pennie W.,"Grove City, OH",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-03,Sat in the restaurant for 20 minutes and not one waitress ever approached us. Spoke to a manager and she said she would have someone right there. Waited a little while longer and just left. Poor service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
3,Carol W.,"Orlando, FL",35,1,1.0,1.0,2017-10-09,Terribly slow service. It took over 10 minutes to get seated then after ordering drinks - they did not come back for over 20 minutes.

0,David L.,"Greensboro, NC",33,158,38.0,4.0,2017-11-23,"Applebee's offers a free meal to veterans on Veteran's Day and has been doing it in Greensboro for 10 years.  The first year we had to wait to get seated because they were one of the few with this offer around here.   Now there are many places that do it but we come back to Applebee's because of their continuous support.  This year we were greeted in the lobby and given a special menu and a small US Flag, a nice touch.  The menu had a nice selection of items from across the menu.  The meals were served very quickly considering the crowd.  The server was very attentive without being intrusive, a very fine line to manage.  The food was very tasty and plentiful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-6,,,,,
