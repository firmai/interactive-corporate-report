47,Mike V.,"San Carlos, CA",0,9,,1.0,2012-07-26,"Generally applebee's is a nice family place to get good food and service. Well this place was NOT. It had the worst service a restaurant  would have.  It took someone 10 minutes to order our drinks.   About another 10 minutes later they finally took our order for food and brought us our drinks.  After we took our order we realized that there was no silverware at our table.  We asked for silverware and when they brought it to us it was dirty.  It was a disaster.  We had to ask for cleaner silverware. About  45 minutes later are food finally came, but we still had no silverware.  Finally are silverware came and it looked clean.   We ate are food which was okay.   I wish someone could come from the food critic business and see how there experience was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

46,A A.,"Issaquah, WA",3,16,,2.0,2013-01-15,"My husband and I recently moved from Seattle- we enjoyed a particular Applebee's restaurant up there and were excited to see one in Bend.  We were seated in a booth where we sat and sat and sat until finally someone took our order. We ordered the spinach and artichoke hot dip, but it was just spinach and not very good. Our dishes showed up and were only marginal. I could have done better by buying a frozen bag of chicken and veggies and it would have tasted better than the slop that arrived. My husband's pasta was less than appetizing and my asian chicken salad was only so-so. It was such a disappointment that a favorite place to go for dinner turned out to be worse than a frozen entree from the grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2?start=40,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003
51,Terri B.,"Troutdale, OR",0,13,,1.0,2013-01-29,"I had to put a star down, but if given the choice I would not have even done that.  It was probably the worst restaurant experience i have ever had.  14 of us went there for a birthday party,  and the crappy service started the minute we walked in.   It took 15 mins just to get our drinks ordered.  Drinks came out at all different times.  Two drinks took close to 20 minutes and two were completely forgotten.  When dinner finally arrived, out of 14 people 5 dinners were sent back.  I ordered a steak with spinach stuffed portabello mushrooms, what I got was a pile of potatoes and mushy veggies.  I asked the waitress about the stuffed mushrooms and she sent the mamanger over.  He explained that they were out of mushrooms (of course no one told me). After several people from the table complained about dinner and sent their meals back, I think he decided to take it all out on me.  When he was done and left the table, I was in shock...When the checks came, they did comp us 5 drinks, and 4 meals.  The manager came back and said he was sorry, then decided we needed to hear all his excuses of what went wrong, and of course he wasn't included.  While we were waiting for our food, I noticed a couple come in the door and were not helped, and they left.  A family of 4 came in and waited several minutes before someone walked by and said that they would help them in a minute.  Of course a minute took several and they decided to leave.   Never again.....The meal comps and ""I'm sorrys"" will never make me come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2?start=40,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
34,Keith A.,"Bend, OR",84,254,764.0,3.0,2013-02-09,"It's been over a year since we've been here.  Decided to give it a whirl the other night.  Not much has changed.  Read previous review.   However, two positives from this past night were:  The ""2 for 20"" specials was right up our alley.  Shared a mozzarella app and we each had the Oriental Chicken Salad----which was heavy on the cabbage & light on the lettuce (blah) but still tasted okay.  Not great.  Musta been the bottom of the bag?  Washed down with their signature Perfect Margarita, we left satisfied. Second positive was our service.  Sat at one of the elevated (tall) tables in the bar.  Our server was FANTASTIC!  Engaging, fun, attentive.  My wife thought she might have been the actual bartender.  I dunno.  She had the personality for it though.  Either way, she was a definite plus for the entire experience.  In the end, especially after reading other's reviews, I stand firm that our local Applebee's is totally hit or miss.  When it's on, it's on.

42,Cynthia P.,"Bend, OR",7,11,2.0,2.0,2013-09-13,"We waited 10-15 minutes after being seated, a server never even came to our table... I used the women's restroom and it was filthy with water (well I hope it was water) all over the floor, broken toilet paper holders, filthy counters, a broken leaking toilet. I returned to the table to find that no server had come yet.... Finally a manager came over and got our drink order, we waited 10 more minutes for our drinks to be brought to us by another person still not our server mind you we were sitting at a tall table right next to the bar and could see our drinks sitting there the whole time. We sat for another 20 minutes for someone to come up to our table and say ""looks like you guys are ready to order"" no introduction no specials named, no greeting, no nothing. Another server then came over and said our drinks would be compted since we had to wait so long to have our order taken, 15 minutes later the manager comes over and says that the server was incorrect and they cannot comp alcoholic drinks at all. Our appetizer arrived we got boneless buffalo wings that were luke warm, upon bitting into them it was very clear they were under a heat lamp not the greatest taste at all. When our food came, it was less than mediocre. I had the honey pepper chicken and shrimp on top of green beans and potatoes. Now I will say this the potatoes and the green beans were cooked perfectly however it was so smothered in honey it was the only taste that could be tasted so those perfectly cooked green beens and perfectly cooked potatoes could not even be tasted, this meal was also luke warm, my husband had the riblette basket and fries made into a platter. The riblettes he said tasted horrible, and were cold, the fries were gross he had one fry and said hardly any salt I took a bite of a different fry and it was so salty I gagged, fries were also cold. During all of this hardly anyone came over to our table. We never really knew who our actual server was. We saw 3 different servers come to our table and the manager. The last server that came to our table we started telling him we were not satisfied and before we could even finish speaking he was walking away and calling over the manager no words accept "" i will get her and yup she is on her way over here"" We left very unsatisfied with the food and the wait staff service!  Now with that being said I will say this the new manager Liz went out of her way to try to make things better for us. She comped our meals, she spoke with us she apologized, she offered us new meals (though we declined) and asked us to return! Liz is a great addition to this particular Applebee's and I personally see her making great changes. We will try Applebee's in bend one more time and it is only because the manager made such an effort to turn around a bad situation. So because of that manager and only because of that manager am I giving 2 stars in this review otherwise it would have been a 1 or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2?start=40,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

Everything tasted good except the pizza. Edible is as good as I can rate it. OK, now the service. First...they brought out our food....we didn't have any silverware, so we had to request it. Then the server forgot to bring the drinks for one of my kids. Refills, none were offered even when we had empty glasses/cups.

I had the Oriental salad which was mostly coleslaw with almonds. It was not good. The rest of the family enjoyed their meals. Chicken strips and a chicken wrap. The server was very nice but she was tending bar and taking orders. It took forever to get refills for our sodas. They should have had 4 or 5 other servers working.

I waited inside, no one greeted me, and there were no signs directing me to wait or seat myself, so I seated myself in the bar area. Still nobody talked to me -- no waiters, no waitresses. I sat for 10 minutes trying to make eye contact with anyone, then I gave up, left and won't ever be coming back. I could have hunted someone down but I was tired and didn't mind leaving for a better option I should have chosen anyhow for dinner.

I never order steak and never at a place not known for steaks, what was I thinking?? Husband had shrimp and linguini, his meal was hot and tasty. The salad wedge was the best part of the meal.

15,Adam R.,"Federal Way, WA",279,296,190.0,1.0,2014-12-21,"I think we had been here a number of years ago when we were in town but don't remember what it was like. Unfortunately, I remember what this trip was like and it's one that makes me not want to go back to this location. I generally like Applebee's and enjoy the fresh food and their healthy portion of the menu. While the food was ok on this trip, the service was terrible. I get it that some people have off days, and maybe that was the case, but dang. It started when it took a very long time for our waiter to stop by. When he did, we placed our order but because he wasn't paying attention (looking off at another table) we had to repeat the order to him because he didn't here it. After placing the order, it took almost 15 minutes for me to get my beer and the rest of the table to get their beverages. Because it was happy hour, we ordered two orders of the pretzel sticks and one order of the sweet potato fries. For the main course, I ordered the mac and cheese and my husband ordered the chicken. Our dining companions ordered the wonton tacos, wedge salad and french onion soup. I list the entire table order because what we got isn't what showed up. About 20 minutes later, we got the fries, an order of pretzels and an order of Spinach/Artichoke dip and chips. About another 15 minutes later we got the wedge salad, tacos and chicken. While eating their entree's a second order of the pretzels made it out. I figured I wasn't going to get my entree so I enjoyed the pretzels. Well, at some point it was noticed that they still owed the second entree, so I asked him to just bring it in a box. I had already eaten so much of the appetizers. By the end of the evening, we got the bill. One of the appetizers was not rung in as Happy Hour prices and we were charged for the soup we never got. SO, since a manger had never been by like they are supposed to, we had to go ask someone to get them. It took another 15 minutes for the manager to make his way by. All the while, our waiter hadn't even bothered to stop by. While the manager fixed the check issues, it didn't seem like he cared. Overall, a very bad experience and since we don't live here, I don't plan to be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

20,Lacy C.,"Rocklin, CA",11,26,2.0,5.0,2015-04-08,"As a business traveler, I've ended up in Bend, Oregon.  I was coming from Corvallis yesterday evening, and not being very familiar with the state, I nearly had a panic attack trying to get to Bend in a Toyota Corolla (but that's another story for another Yelp review).  The result was that when I finally arrived last night, I was too stressed out to eat anything, so today-- after 27 hours without eating-- I found myself at this Applebee's, ready to eat everything in the world. I took a seat in the bar area and found that service from Cari E. was friendly and attentive.  She also informed me of the daily drink specials, of which I took advantage of the special on house wine ($4 a glass!  Yayyy!!!) I've heard lots of hype about the pub bites menu but haven't had a chance to try it yet, so I asked Cari to bring me an order of the pub bites buffalo wings to start off as an app.  The wings were generously and evenly coated, yet still crispy!  They're a bit overpriced at $5.99 for 4 wings, but otherwise, I thought the pub bites portion was perfect for a single app. For lunch, I ordered from the pick-a-pair menu and got the chicken caesar salad and the Clubhouse grille.  Portions of chicken on the caesar were generous.  The flavor of the Clubhouse grille was a bit odd, but that might have just been the sweetness of the BBQ sauce on it.  I thought both portions-- the salad portion paired with the half sandwich-- was PERFECT for lunch.  Not too much, not too little. Finally, I couldn't resist adding on a brownie bite (which comes with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream) for $1.99.  There's no way I would have paid $5.99 for an entier giant brownie sundae, so the brownie bite portion was PERFECT and it was the perfect cap for my lunch! Overall, well done on service, portions, and food selection.  I'm not local to Bend, but based on this experience, I'll be sure to visit my local Applebee's much more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2?start=20,1.9720000000000002,1.9720000000000002,1.9720000000000002,1.9720000000000002,1.9720000000000004

With that said, I am assuming service should be much better than it was. It took almost an hour to get food and it was not a full restaurant. The food was Luke warm at best, nothing special and tasted really salty. I asked for extra sauce when they served our food, I had to press the button for the waitress call finally 15 minutes later our waitress showed up and I had to ask again for sauce. There was not many employees wondering around to flag down to refills or anything. Forget dessert, we went out for ice cream. I gave 2 stars because I did not have to cook or clean up the dishes.

19,Jayde marie L.,"Redmond, OR",6,10,,1.0,2016-03-07,"Very unimpressed. Applebee's was not our first choice, but I had received a gift card. So we went out to Applebee's and decided on the 2 for $20 menu, we chose the Mozzerella Sticks appetizer, the Three Cheese Cavatappi, and the Grilled Bourbon Skillet Chicken with Shrimp. We had been sitting for about 20 minutes before the waitress even headed to our table to take our drink order, but asked us to wait for a moment so she could deliver another table their food. We continued to wait, when finally we were able to place our order. We sat and waited for our drinks and appetizer which took about 20 minutes, which we had quickly devoured, only to wait an additional 30 minutes for our meal. Now to the main dish, the three cheese Cavatappi was in fact not a Cavatappi, but a Penne noodle, which I didn't mind, but was a little turned off when I noticed a mix of Penne and Cavatappi noodles, when I asked the waitress she told me that she had forgotten to let me know that they are getting new menu's and that the noodle had changed. I told her no problem and we continued to pick at our food. I then noticed that in my Three Cheese Cavata- Penne, an Italian pasta dish, was a large amount of Pico De Gallo, now I love and live for Pico De Gallo, but NOT in my Italian pasta dish. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Shrimp, and the Shrimp was good, just very over seasoned, the Chicken was very hard to cut through, the mushrooms and onions thrown on the skillet/plate were burnt, and the roasted potatoes were raw. After finally deciding we would not eat anymore, we looked at the bill on their electronic device, with the ""2for $20"" and my iced tea for $2.99, our total should have been 22.99 but instead, it was 25.49, and we were charged 22.50 for the ""2 for $20"". So we called the waitress over and asked her about the price and she said ""Oh I forgot to tell you, on our new menu, the chicken and shrimp is on the 2 for $25 meal deal"". We then told her that it was fine, but that we would like to be charged what we thought we were paying for. The waitress then went and made the change, brought the receipt over and told us to have a nice night.  I don't plan on going to an Applebee's again, because of this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bend-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

I want to read what I want on the menu, not taste it on the menu. The menu's were bent and warped. Items were crossed off menu with a black marker-tacky! The bathrooms were not kept up and were disgusting. We were told to sit and it would 10 minutes before a table is open. However, many tables were open and the help was very slow in cleaning them. The Hostess was far from the mostess. When the mozzarella sticks were delivered, it was gently thrown on our table and the gal was already walking away when she announced what they were. If we didn't have a gift card from our wedding, we would have left but it was still a gross experience.  I don't know why but Tuesday Margarita and Kids  Night seems like a bad combo to me.

10,Paul B.,"Bend, OR",0,16,,1.0,2016-06-03,"This place, despite its recent facelift, has just gotten gross, and in my opinion you can blame the staff and the management! I've been in several other Applebee's that are much better. A friend and I visited yesterday. We arrived at 11:00 AM, just as they were unlocking the doors, so we were literally the first two customers in the restaurant. My friend went to use the restroom, and while I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice that our tabletop felt sticky. Looking around, I noticed bits of food and other dirt and debris on the floors everywhere - under adjacent tables and chairs, and in the aisles. My friend came back, and his first comment was ""can you believe this place just opened? The bathroom's disgusting. I had to flush the toilet before I used it - there was still urine in it!"" I checked it out as well - trash cans were overflowing, there were water spots all over the mirrors, and there were bits of paper towel, toilet paper, and dust on the floors. I rarely see restaurants in such a filthy condition after a day of hard use, let alone when they first open their doors. When we left several hours later, the floors and bathroom were even worse than when we arrived. It obviously calls into question the condition of the kitchen, and the quality of the food we were getting. My friend and I have been regular customers of this Applebee's for many years, and have seen it steadily decline.
