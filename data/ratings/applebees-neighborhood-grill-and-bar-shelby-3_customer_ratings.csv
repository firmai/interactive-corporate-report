11,Chris M.,"Stevensville, MD",3,23,,3.0,2012-05-15,"Well, so far the manager looks like he just played racket ball in this work clothes. Just a sloppy mess. Sam Adams was hidden in the veggie fridge according to the bar tender. Food is looking good though. Went with the bourbon street steak which is always a sure bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
4,Michael N.,"Charlotte, NC",238,1258,2702.0,1.0,2014-09-08,"I really do not like to give one star reviews because I do realize that this place of business is someone's livelihood. This will be my last visit/check-in here as you will see. I can not even be lured back with craft beer on tap. We went about two weeks ago on a Friday night. Pulling up we saw who we learned later to be the general manager sitting on the stoop/sidewalk by the dumpster with other employees, smoking cigarettes. Very professional. We were seated with the intention of having a couple of beers that were on special. We noted a waitress cleaning the table next to us. She wiped the table and literally chunks of food were falling on the carpet in front of the table. Did anyone come and pick up the chunks/sweep? Of course not. A family was seated there and they were stepping all over the food on the floor. I am very suprised those people did not say anything; I would have. We were told what the price for our beers would be for a ""Brutus"" (their tall glass), and the actual price was $1.50 more per beer (apparently they weren't on special like the waiter said they were). We were also told that appetizers were half off after 10 PM, so we ordered Green Bean Fries and Won Ton Tacos. They were just okay; they left that super greasy feeling in your mouth (like how a ducks back repels water). So we get the bill and all of the prices are wrong. We talk with our waiter and he goes to check the prices; apparently our appetizers weren't half off. He turned over a placard on the table and showed which ones were half off. Jeez - just terrible. You could tell he was really embarrased and we decided not to call a manager over and get him in trouble. Is running a ""chain"" restaurant that follows a corporate formula really that difficult? Apparently it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
5,Christy M.,"Charleston, SC",125,276,847.0,2.0,2014-10-25,"Only eating here out of necessity. Put in a 15 person to go order for the team the night before. The people were nice, but we had to take a few orders back in because the orders were incorrect. I ordered the strawberry salad with chicken. The dressing was good, but it's a really small salad for $10 with a few slices of cold chicken. I found myself thinking how thankful I am to live in Charleston and have much better non-chain options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
9,Lynn E.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,39,17.0,1.0,2015-03-01,"Dinner at this Applebee's is less than appealing.  I ordered the Nacho's.  They were cold - the cheese was not melted - all it was - a bunch of chips sprinkled with lettuce - tomatoes - cheese and a small amount of the brisket.  When I tried to speak the manager - she ignored me and would not make eye contact.  The 2 bartenders walked by my empty wine glass at least 8 times before asking if I wanted a refill.  This Applebee's may be under new management, but they are as bad as the last ones.  Write this location off your list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
7,Adam T.,"Portland, OR",8,5,,1.0,2015-06-17,"Looking for a place slightly more disappointing than a truck stop Denny's? Welcome to Applebees in Shelby!  We get there on a Tuesday evening to a 1/4 full restaurant, there is no one to seat us. After five minutes someone from the bar yells someone will help us in a moment. All this while there are two bartenders at an empty bar, two waitresses/one waiter milling around said bar chit chatting and one person I can only assume was the manager walking around aimlessly. At this point a couple came in after us swore, and promptly left. The only reason we even stayed at this point is due to my mother in law.  I finally said screw it and led us to an empty booth. Once we sit down a few employees walk past us multiple times even though it's obvious we don't even have menus. Eventually by some random chance, the person I'm guessing was the manager drops some menus off and walks away.  Skip ahead. Three people ordered steak all medium done and I ordered their philly steak sub option. Two steaks arrive fine, one arrives brown and fucking purple/cold on the inside. When we brought this up the waitress said that's how it was ordered, after a short lesson on what medium means she agreed to have it taken back and refired, not replace but just cooked more. My philly arrived with no onions or jalapanenos, when I brought this up to the manager she said oh I'm sorry and offered to get me a refill on my drink.  On top of it all, a couple hours later I'm spewing copious amounts of liquids from both ends of my body. I've eaten egg salad sandwiches from gas stations and not gotten sick, one trip to Applebees and I'm down with food poisoning. A fucking joke.  In short, go like three blocks down to a drive through burger and shake joint that had cars lined up to order, next time I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
6,Dee B.,"Shelby, NC",0,12,2.0,1.0,2015-09-05,"One star is generous for this place. Restaurant was extremely cold. Waited 25 min for an appetizer and it wasn't crowded. Waitress was good but she had to keep checking on the appetizer. They also tried to bring the food out at the same time as the appetizer. Manager is worthless she witnessed everything and only gave an I'm sorry. Then she came back to the table and said she knew I was one of the ""regulars"" even thought that was my first time there . I was so disgusted and felt I wasted my time and money. Food was just ok. I would not recommend this place stay away!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
8,Casey D.,"Landrum, SC",149,61,45.0,1.0,2015-10-18,Nice decor.  Seems like it was recently updated.  Food was mehhh compared to the other Applebee's I've been to.  Service was mehh as well.  Wasn't the greatest experience. I've been to this location several times.  Just had a bad experience so this is my review.  Will update next time I stop in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
10,Scott W.,"Cherryville, NC",0,3,,1.0,2015-12-04,"Service on the floor stinks. No idea of customer service, no idea of staffing the restaurant properly, no menu knowledge and basically a fail on all fronts. Save yourself some frustration and go somewhere else. Waitstaff would rather be joking at the bar rather than making money. Poor performance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
2,Garrett S.,"Charleston, SC",36,4,18.0,3.0,2016-07-10,"We came here looking for a late dinner (10pm) after driving 8hrs from Indianapolis. It's Applebee's, which is the middle of the road, sit down, variety restaurant for when you can't decide what to eat.  Our server was polite and friendly (Nick) and was quick and attentive to our needs. The portions were smaller than in Indiana so I'm not sure why that was the case.  My only complaints are that the boneless wings were dry/hard that time and the area/crowd seemed shady at times. For example, loud bar crowd and a distinct herbal aroma in the parking lot.  All things considered, it was okay food (not fast food at least) and the waiter really saved our overall experience by being on top of it. 1\2 to  overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
3,Emily F.,"Kings Mountain, NC",32,5,,2.0,2016-11-26,"My boyfriend and I eat here all the time. We've had tiny problems here and there, but today was the worst we experienced. We ordered our 2 for $20 like we always do and our appetizer was fine. They bring the food out and our waitress put in the wrong order for my plate. I understand that's a simple mistake, no big deal. They corrected the mistake, but whenever I got my correct dish it was cold! The chicken and the pasta was cold and it was just not good at all. The waitress offered a free dessert (a very tiny brownie) for the wait of getting the correct dish which was okay. We will come back no doubt because we love applebees, but I don't think we will ever come back around lunch time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
1,Shandi H.,"Killeen, TX",47,55,288.0,3.0,2017-04-22,I wish there was more space. The waitress that I had (Brittany) was a sweetheart. And she was pregnant so we left her a good tip. The night we went was prom night so it was really packed and very busy. We still received our food in a timely mannor and it was still good. Some of the customers were horrible but you can't really blame the restaraunt for that. It was an ok experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
0,Alan R.,"Shelby, NC",7,121,,3.0,2018-01-07,"Sheesh. Looking at the reviews here I expected this place to be a wasteland fitting a Mad Max film or something. A friend gave us a gift card for Applebee's for Christmas so we decided to grab lunch here today. I will say that they had a handwritten sign on the door stating that they were out of riblets and baby back ribs. Maybe this had to do with the recent winter weather along the coast?     Anyways, that didn't affect our orders. My wife had some wonton tacos that she really seemed to enjoy, my daughter had a kids meal of mac and cheese, and I had the spiral homemade mac and cheese topped with chicken tenders in a honey pepper sauce. It was pretty good. Certainly not the greatest meal ever but  it tasted good, was served quick and hot, and no one tried to shank me while eating it. The waitress was super nice and very, very attentive. They even had a way for us to pay at the table through a little tablet like device that seemed to allow for splitting the bill and everything if you needed that. All in all, everything seemed fine today unless you wanted riblets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shelby-3,,,,,
