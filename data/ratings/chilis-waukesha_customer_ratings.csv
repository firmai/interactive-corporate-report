14,Mit L.,"Wales, WI",10,59,80.0,3.0,2012-10-22,As long as the chicken gets fully cooked it's a decent place to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
13,Adam L.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,25,,5.0,2013-07-07,"Friendly staff, fast service, good food.  I like how you can pay at the table using their electronic gizmo: that is, you don't have to wait for the server to bring the check.  Very large and diverse menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
12,Stephanie O.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,7,,1.0,2013-08-08,"Everything tasted like it was sitting ALL day then just microwaved. Not sure the chicken was really chicken, it was some processed stuff. Cafeteria food basically.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
9,Jeff B.,"Waukesha, WI",0,1,,3.0,2014-01-09,"Some things good, some bad. Fajitas I had for lunch had 1 fajita worth of cheese, lettuce and sour cream. Very light on the steak too. There was a huge amount of green peppers though. Not very fun to eat. Another day dinner had a short wait, but I counted 10 open tables. Maybe for reservations? We were the only ones waiting. The host didn't seem to be enjoying his job. Staff are very quiet and seem bored/annoyed. Usually attitude is contagious, down from management, just my opinion. Server that night came to take our order, and half way through my response, without saying anything to us, she turned away from us and started having a conversation with another waitress about a mixup between her and another table. Apparently the other table hadn't seen a waitress at all yet and they complained. Without communicating with us at all, she just wandered away, then went to the other table to take their order instead. Ok, not a problem, but saying at least something to us about it would have been a normal thing to do. When she came back, she acted like this was her first time taking our order, and didn't explain anything. Just weird behavior. Got our food on time, but had to ask for sour cream, twice. No drink refills happened. They are either under staffed/over worked or the server's and host's minds are elsewhere. Burger was good... My wife really really liked her tilapia and said it was done perfect and so was her broccoli. Usually the food brings us back, but the weird service pushes us away.  I think next time it's buffalo wild wings where the food isn't quite as good but the service is always awesome. They even remember us and we only go there about once every other month at the most! Never had a bad experience at the sunset bw3s.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
10,Julie C.,"Waukesha, WI",5,4,,5.0,2014-04-21,Always exceptional service here and great food! They did an amazing job hosting a large crowd of my family when we celebrated with a group of 14 and never complain when my husband and I share a meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
8,Andy F.,"Waukesha, WI",17,135,1.0,2.0,2015-03-03,Food was really really salty. I kid you not I'm at my third bottle of water as of today because of the food....yuck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
11,Thomas K.,"Waukesha, WI",1,11,,3.0,2015-08-15,Getting better.  Constant staff turnover majes me wonder about management.  2 years ago your table would be greeted by the manager asking about experience.  That does not happen now.  The food is ok but they never seem to have proper staffing...eitger 5 waiters in empty restaurant or 2 servers and packed restaurant.  Get it together please!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
7,Mike T.,"New Berlin, WI",0,11,,5.0,2015-08-29,I like this place but there is a huge turn over of waitresses   I get a nice waitress and next week their gone.  Chips and salsa can become a full meal but I wish the 2 for $20.00 would have more items added,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
4,Lucas D.,"Waukesha, WI",1,3,,3.0,2016-08-06,Very great Staff members And Delicious food items. Most of the time I come the order is usually messed up somehow. I would recommend this restaurant to Burger loving people. And people who are calm when staff mess up your order. Overall rating I would say 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
0,Megan C.,"Milwaukee, WI",182,292,940.0,4.0,2016-08-14,"Our waiter Kathy gets a million stars . She was the nicest lady I've ever meet , and a good waitress . She refilled our drinks before we were even done !  I would give the atmosphere one star because the booth  smelled like bad body order wiped down . They need a different cleaner I think , it was gross .  The food was excellent . They have their 2 for $20 and they also have a 3 for $10 thing .  The menu has been updated since the last time I was here . They offer tons of new appetizers . They also have smoked wings now , which I would definitely try .  They have tons of American and Mexican food options .  Great for families . There's a kiosk thing on the table you can pay your bill on .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
6,Shannon M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,19,,2.0,2016-08-29,"I went out with my mom and niece for a birthday. I ordered a vegetarian meal. The waiter didn't bring it out with the rest of the food since it had chicken in it, which I do appreciate, but I waited at least 10 minutes for my food while everyone ate their meals. Additionally, they brought me the wrong food. The waiter/manager did nothing to rectify the situation and charged me full price for the meal. The food wasn't good, and the service was completely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
5,Clara C.,"Gurnee, IL",72,33,2.0,2.0,2017-01-27,"I came in with five other people for a Friday lunch. We were seated immediately and our server greeted us pretty quickly. He was friendly and kept up with the witty banter that a couple people in the group provided. It took him about seven or eight minutes to make bring our waters and then he took our order. We waited for about half an hour for a couple of burgers and salads. The managers brought the food and made an excuse, saying ""Sorry guys. Had a problem with the quesadillas."" We finally got to eat and once we finished we asked for a box and the checks. We waited for another fifteen minutes and our server was nowhere to be found. Finally one person from our group went to the bar to ask for our tickets. The server came around the corner as if he was angry that we asked. He talked over my friend telling him, ""I'm getting it sir. I just split the tickets. I did it."" My friend said, ""Well we still need the box."" The server said, ""I'm getting sir."" I could have overlooked the fact that he acted like this was his second week as a server if he hadn't raised his voice to my friend. It is absolutely unacceptable for a visit to a relatively empty restaurant to take an hour and fifteen minutes on a weekday for lunch. People have an hour for lunch usually and we didn't even get our food until we had been there over 45 minutes. I understand the struggle of being a new server but it is absolutely unacceptable to have that New of a server in a lounge by himself when time is of the essence. The managers didn't really seem to care either. The food was good once we finally got to eat but the rest of the visit was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
3,Steve B.,"Waukesha, WI",2,72,2.0,5.0,2017-02-05,First time here. Wanted something different. I was happy to see a low calorie selection. The Spicy Chile Chicken. The chicken was done perfect and the black bean salsa really added to it. The quinoa and wheatberry was a tasty alternative to blah rice. The steamed broccoli was tender.  I will return and order this again. The waiter was very pleasant. The check-out kiosk is a wonderful convenience. Lots of great looking items on the menus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
2,David B.,"Brookfield, WI",5,16,2.0,4.0,2017-02-28,"Another great lunch at Chili's.  This restaurant is one of the most reliable always clean and comfortable,  with great food. We usually have the soup and sandwich lunch but all is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
1,Seth S.,"Mukwonago, WI",8,12,,3.0,2017-07-23,Very much just okay good. The Texas cheese fries were slightly over cooked and didn't seem to have enough jalapeño peppers on them. The burger was a good choice from the menu and the fajitas smelled great.  In the end its a chain restaurant so expect that same level as other big chains.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waukesha,,,,,
