Ava P.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,37,2,5.0,3/29/2013,"UH-OHHH I HAVE A BAD BAD FEELING THIS ONE IS CLOSED TOO!! We always come here, often once a week and the food and service is excellent. We always come around 11am to 3pm and it seems those Yelpers who've had a bad experience go later into the evening. I was looking on the TGI Fridays official website for the address to the Happy Valley location and noticed  this one on Tatum is no longer listed. Very bad sign. I called their number and get the phone company creepy dee-dee-deeeee tone with the automated message that the phone number is no  longer in service. But I was just there, how could this be??!! Actually I'm not surprised. I always went to the Friday's on Bell Rd and was shocked when I was there one week and the next week it was suddenly closed totally out of the blue. It was always packed, even during the day, so it made no sense. I mentioned this to the server at Tatum and she said it wasn't because the Bell Rd location wasn't successful, it was because the owner couldn't pay the rent any longer at that location nor at 2 other locations. And he'd done the employees dirty as well. The employees had no clue. One day the owner had them all moving their restaurant equipment to other locations, including the Tatum one. She said the employees were all chattering happily because they were sure it meant they were getting all new stuff. Then after everything was moved the owner tells them the bad news. She said the owner owns this Tatum location and the Happy Valley one as well, but they had no worries, the same couldn't happen to them, because the property was owned not rented at both locations. I remember thinking, ""Great, if he is that lowdown a jerk to pull what he did at the other locations, what would stop him from just selling this location at no notice to the employees."" I have a sad feeling that's exactly what happened. So, it looks like only the Happy Valley and downtown Phoenix locations remain. She said the guy owns the Happy Valley place so I doubt that will be around much longer. Don't know if he operates the downtown one as well...hope not. R.I.P. Fridays...your cheese-sticks are the best, the grocery store version is gross, but the ones at  your restaurants are mm-mmm-MMMM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Scott D.,"Glendale, AZ",800,557,266,3.0,11/30/2012,"The table across from us dined and dashed. The restaurant is making the server pay. That's no bueno! I'm not sure if that wasn't a ploy by the server to get sympathy dollars added to her tip. I normally don't dine at TGI unless I'm dragged kicking and screaming. But the wife was jonsing for the Pretzel and cheese on the 1/2 off appetizer menu. So being a nice guy I said ""okay lets go to TGI Friday's tonight"".The pretzel was awesome by the way. And I would highly recommend it. I like their ribs. It's about the only thing on the menu that I do like. They are meaty and delicious. They have special deals during Sunday football.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Sharon G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",204,276,106,4.0,7/6/2011,"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect. I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Dave F.,"Phoenix, AZ",33,29,,1.0,8/12/2012,"Got here at 8:30p, ordered at 9pm, still waiting for my food. Staff is messing around, watching TV, chatting with friends, etc.  Stay clear of this place. I have never seen a TGI Friday's run so horribly!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Gordon T.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,29,1,1.0,9/12/2014,This restaurant really should not exist. The waiter has made a ton of mistakes and the food takes forever to come out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Cadence C.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,247,7,1.0,3/18/2012,"After a 10 min wait outside, Friday 6:55 PM entered the restaurant. Ordered 7:05 PM. Orders came out way past 7:40 PM. The manager was going around apologizing for delays. We couldn't leave till 8:30 PM.  Our server ""Chad"" was not paying attention and making mistakes that could be avoided. He brought out a french onion soup instead of clam chowder after the 35+ min wait. We ate: The portions were small but the quality was above average. We gave a coupon to Chad. Chad: ""Seperate checks or all together?"" us: 3 seperate checks please. Chad: Together, got it. us: We'd like to split the check between 3 parties please. He processed our bill and came back. The coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again. Chad: ""How was everything guys? Food come out in a timely manner? (dead silence)  Well you're one of the lucky ones"" he said. No, No, and No. Just because we weren't more vocal like the other customers doesn't mean we were one of the ""lucky"" ones. Then he came back. The coupon was applied but he had forgotten 2 of our credit cards. He looked through his apron smock thingy and pulled out the other two credit cards. ""Wow, that looks bad doesn't it?"" he said. No comment, dead silence. He came back with the receipts and one pen... which didn't work at all. At this point, we decided to procure another pen on our own and just sign and tip and get out of there. I had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing. Would not go back for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Roland W.,"Phoenix, AZ",323,379,15,3.0,9/18/2011,"You know those bundles of ads you get in the mail every week on Tuesday and Wednesday? That's the place to look before you head out to TGI Friday's. The last few times I've looked through these ads Friday's has had a BOGO FREE coupon in that bundle of ads. That's the only way I would go to Friday's.  The food isn't bad, it's just okay for the price and if I'm going to spend $50-$60 bucks for a meal it isn't going to be at Friday's. Yesterday we wanted a quick lunch and this location is just down the street in horrible maze referred to as Desert Ridge. Typical Saturday with lots of SUVs headed to Target for diapers and paper towels. Unfortunately no matter how many times you visit Desert Ridge Marketplace you'll never figure out how to get in or out without becoming a prisoner of the parking lot. Oh sorry, this is about Friday's. So we make it to the restaurant unscathed and are promptly seated. Our friendly server came by right away and took our drink order. After taking a few minutes to peruse the menu my partner decided on Tuscan Shrimp Pasta and I ordered the Dragonfire Salmon. The salmon normally comes with a Kung Pao sauce and unless you like an overly sweet sauce covering up perfectly good salmon ask for it on the side like I did. It's much better that way.  The pasta was good as was the salmon. Everything came out quickly and the our drinks were never empty. For $28 plus tip it wasn't a bad deal since we had the coupon. Call me old, but I would have been disappointed if I paid full price. All in all, not a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Sylvia F.,"ASTORIA, NY",240,21,3,2.0,3/10/2013,"Came here because of all the 2 for $10 ads with the delectable, mouthwatering cheeseburgers and queso dip.  I was disappointed to find out that this TGI Fridays didn't have the 2 for $10 on their menu (as if it was a hidden menu) and they didn't offer all of the deals that were on the 2 for $10 ad on the TGI Friday's website.  There was a very limited selection which was disappointing.  Looking through the menu, the average price of meals ranged $18-$24.  When TGI Fridays become a fine dining restaurant? Luckily we were able to order off the 2 for $20 menu and I didn't feel ripped off, but I can't imagine choosing to pay full price and have dinner at TGI Fridays when there are so many BETTER, Fresher, NICER choices of restaurants in that price range.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Larry G.,"Capitol Heights, MD",363,626,10,4.0,1/18/2011,"You know when you go on vacations...you try to check out the local places and restaurants...right? Well, don't ask me why the other parties on my vacation trip wanted to go safe and dine here. And worse, on New Year's Eve!!!!  And on New Year's Eve, this place was pretty much quiet with few tables occupied.  So, waitservice was friendly and attentive. Despite my disappointment with hanging here on New Year's Eve, food was surprisingly good.  Hey, anything with Jack Daniel's in the food is bound to make it delicious! If only TGIF wasn't so dark inside, everything would have been just right.  Turn up the lights a bit.  Not all of us are hideous looking, ya know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Michael N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",88,172,70,2.0,6/6/2011,"Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Mari S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",57,59,49,3.0,8/18/2012,"Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Pity D.,"Seattle, WA",31,240,10,3.0,2/23/2009,"When I die I want to be buried in a coffin made of Jack Daniels chicken strips.  That way I know I'll be in heaven even if Peter cock-blocks me . . . Wait, I just out-smarted God! I swear, you can put Jack Daniels glaze on a petrified rat turd and even Top Chef snob Tom Colicchio would eat it.  It's that good. Unfortunately everything else isn't. The service--at this location--flat out sucks half the time. And the consistency of this kitchen staff sucks about 35% of the time.  If you can, try the Happy Valley TGIF instead. My only other minor gripe is that all the newer Friday's (such as this one) just don't seem to have the same charm as the older Fridays. But I'm willing to let all that 2-star worthy crap slide for some more 5-star worthy Jack Daniels chicken and burgers. TGIFJD 4 life, foo.  And the afterlife too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Tiffany W.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,14,1,3.0,9/12/2010,"Mm. TGIF. You're hit or miss, especially this location. My family and I only ever come here when we're dead tired from work and nobody wants to cook dinner. The last time I was here was pretty darn lack luster and the waiter pretty much ignored us the entire time we were eating, only stopping to ask if everything was okay. He went about doing whatever he was doing. Walking back and forth in an almost empty restaurant. Getting ready to close up 2 hours early maybe? You know what would have made it really awesome? If I had my glass of water refilled. The food is average, and salty. My parents kept complaining about how salty everything was, and our cups were still... Not refilled.  That's my only gripe about this place, when it's 10 p.m and not busy, my whole family feels ignored, and they've pretty much decided to avoid coming here for awhile. Sorry TGIF. Maybe next time?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Joan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,73,,1.0,1/19/2012,"Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Kimberly L.,"Hull, MA",42,68,5,3.0,5/22/2009,"Ok this is sad, but this has honestly become one of my usual N. Scottsdale spots due to the awesome late night and happy hour specials. The happy hour is awesome - both food and drinks - and their jack daniels strips are great.  I would also recommend the brucetta chicken pasta and the sizzling chicken plate something or other.  Just - uh - dont go there for the ""ambiance""  its TGI Fridays for gods sake - hence the 3 stars Surprisingly, they make a not so bad mojito (ask for Jessica - best bartender they've got by far).  Happy hunting",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Chukki S.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,1020,291,2.0,7/23/2011,"Awful service.  The waiter had the personality of a dead moth.  I think he said 4 words to us the whole time we were there.  He actually brought us the wrong appetizer because I couldn't hear what he said and after asking him to repeat himself again, I finally just said, ""Ummm, ok sure"" and then he brought the wrong thing.  Never seen so much white trash at Desert Ridge.  Tab was cheap though.  $20 for two appetizers and 2 alcoholic drinks.  Next time I think I'll just pay the extra money and go to Rock Bottom or Yardhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Leslie R.,"Phoenix, AZ",102,97,14,2.0,4/28/2011,"Friday's food has always been consistent, but my first time at this location wasn't great. The food was fine, but our table was dark, we had to ask for utensils, they put onions on my salad when I asked for it without, and it smelled. It's that grease trap smell and we kept getting whiffs of it throughout dinner. Blech! Also, as with many places, they don't list their beer-on-tap prices. Fine, but the waiter should at least know what they are when we ask.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Robert P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,16,2,1.0,2/3/2012,"Stopped in for a light dinner and was HUGELY disappointed. We waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table, 10 minutes to get our drinks and have our food order taken, and then when we got the ""gourmet"" Mac & Cheese. It looked like vomit on a dirty plate and had dry chicken on top. Tried to talk to a manager but they couldn't be bothered so we walked out. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix
Heather W.,"Phoenix, AZ",96,82,10,4.0,10/30/2008,"Me and a friend of mine frequent this place a few times a month. We always sit out back on the little patio and enjoy the weather. We usually go on Friday nights and this place is always dead. I would not recommend going here if you are looking to socialize or party it up at the bar. I like that about it though. We can sit on the patio, chit chat and enjoy our food and not be bothered.  We usually get half priced appetizers for happy hour and a few drinks. It ends up being pretty cheap. I love the nachos! They are really good here and they put lots of crap on top and don't skimp!  Couple of negatives...service tends to be really slooooow on occasion. We went here last Friday and our server only came out twice and we had to hunt him down to get our check and then another 15 mins later when he never came out to grab the card to run. (he was pretty cute though and apologized, so all was forgiven!) Other bad thing is on the rare occasion when there are other people on the patio, it gets kind of awkward because the placement of the tables are so close.  Other than those few little issues, I really like going here to grab a bite and hang out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix

Lauren J.,"Gilbert, AZ",155,315,10,1.0,8/12/2012,"I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a ""free"" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix?start=20
Jessica D.,"Syracuse, NY",0,5,3,1.0,12/25/2012,"Came here for Christmas dinner with my mother. Big mistake. 7 o'clock and they were packed! I couldn't believe it. We waited 20 mins for a table (which we didn't mind, we were in no rush). After getting our drinks, we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer. We waited and waited, finally, like 20 minutes later watery guacamole (it looked like pea soup) and the WORST tortilla chips came out. The chips were so stale we couldn't finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease. We spit it out and told our waitress. She brought us new chips that were not much better, but edible. We kept the soupy guac, as we hated to complain...they were so busy we just blew that off. I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken. I don't do dairy, so asked for no cheese. Waitress said no problem. Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries. The food came after 35 minutes. My pasta with extra cheese. Ugh...and 4 of the rawest shrimp sitting on top. Sent it back because I can't eat cheese. Waitress brought a new one without cheese. I like my shrimp well done, or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp. She brought the new pasta, it was ice cold. Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta! So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp. Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot again...resulting in it being dryer than dry. Ekkk. Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease. Literally. She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up. Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter. And the shrimp was missing from her plate! After asking several times they finally brought it. Nothing special. Just shrimp. We used a coupon buy one get on free. They charged us 6$ for my four raw shrimp. It was ridiculous. Yes, it was Christmas, but really? This experience should have been better. Even for Christmas night. I don't think we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix?start=20

Ted J.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,37,27,4.0,8/10/2010,We stop in Friday's every few weeks for Happy Hour. They have great beer and food specials during happy hour.

Georgia R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",220,708,405,4.0,1/29/2007,"If you want to go out, without really going out out (this sentence made sense in my head), then this is the place for you.  You'll always find quite a few people just hanging out in the bar area and the restaurant area is usually really busy. Drinks are decently priced and the food is well...bar food. Fried. Breaded.
