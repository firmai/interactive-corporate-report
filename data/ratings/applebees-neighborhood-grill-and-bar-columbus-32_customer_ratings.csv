8,Mike G.,"Columbus, OH",221,475,1606.0,2.0,2013-01-30,"I went to Applebee's with some friends the other day.  Typical Applebee's decor, food and service.  If you've been to one, you've been to any of them.  Our waiter was OK, nothing special.  He made sure that we had everything we needed and he did keep checking on us at regular corporate defined intervals. The food was edible.  I ordered the appetizer platter with boneless buffalo wings, teriyaki chicken tacos and spinach dip with tortilla chips.  It was alright, but it was just like the frozen foods you can get at the grocery.  I'm thinking the GFS truck stops here twice a week. Everyone else was very happy with their meal but then, they love Applebees, Ponderosa, Hometown Buffet, etc, so there you go. Everyone working there looked like they were college students putting in their time at a job they really didn't want, but were able to paste on a smile whenever they were required to. 2 Stars and not one more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
13,Nicholas W.,"New York, NY",32,67,,2.0,2014-03-04,Meh.. Its Applebee's. You should know what to expect. I just wish they would more vegetarian meals.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
14,Jeffrey E.,"Galloway, OH",14,24,,1.0,2014-04-28,"Dirty table, dirty booth, blaa food, bad service...(ordered an appetizer, didnt get it! On the upside they didn't bill me for it either)  Like Red Slobster I think I'm done giving Applebee's slack....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
9,Heather C.,"Hilliard, OH",14,52,122.0,2.0,2014-09-14,"What can I say that you don't already know about Applebee's??  Service was ok- he did a couple things that were more than expected and did a coupe things that were less than expected.  So overall, ok.   Food was ok-I can't believe the all you can eat ribs doesn't come in a regular BBQ flavor.  You can only pick from honey BBQ, chipotle, or sweet Asian chile.  They put the sauce on the other ribs/riblets, why can't it be available on the crosscut ribs?  The food was ok as usual, nothing to get excited about.   Restaurant was fairly clean, service was pretty slow, and the noise level wasn't bad at all.  Otherwise, it's like any other Applebee's I've ever been to.  I believe the waiter told us that on Tuesday nights kids meals are $0.99.   I guess it depends on the location because the one we used to go to did free kids meals on Tuesday.  This particular location was ok, but definitely not one of top five choices for an an everyday dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
7,Troy S.,"Hilliard, OH",87,730,522.0,2.0,2014-12-19,"Quick Lunch?   The service here is a bit slow as our lunch break when longer than expected.  we had a big group of 10-12 people but it sure took a while to get us soup, salad, sandwiches along with our bill.  I guess we should have mentioned that we needed our bills back quicker.  We did mention that we were on lunch break.   Food was good as my soup was tasty.  The club sandwich was ok.  It was a typical Applebees and the food was good not great.  I probably wont choose this place for a quick lunch again.  Actually it wasn't my choice but my desire for ethnic cuisines doesn't work with my co-workers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
12,Penne M.,"Pickerington, OH",2,57,,4.0,2015-07-31,"I've been to this Applebee's a couple of times.   The bar tender remembers us and what we like,  always makes you feel like you ate walking into a neighborhood pave rather than a chain.   French onion soup,  and those amazing wonton tacos make a great lunch.  Add the friendly service and you get a place well keep going to regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
10,Paul M.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,16,1.0,1.0,2015-10-23,Slow service and Wait staff who probably wonders why they don't get tipped well.  Don't waste your time at this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
11,Daniel M.,"Columbus, OH",242,36,36.0,5.0,2016-01-16,After a long day of work at   me and my wife enjoyed a great experience at Applebee's the waitress was wonderful and the manager even came out to make sure everything was going great definitely a five-star restaurant thanks for the great evening,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
4,Abigail B.,"Columbus, OH",87,69,5.0,3.0,2016-02-14,"I like this applebees. I always have good servers and people are nice here. However, in general, I feel like applebees is taking a turn for the worst. Their food is just not as good as it use to be. However, I usually get their French onion soup as a starter and its delicious! Everything else is just mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
5,Donnie B.,"Columbus, OH",108,4,1.0,5.0,2016-08-18,Went here for a lunch to catch up with a friend. Super friendly atmosphere and staff. I'm vegetarian and the server helped me with options I can choose from and shown me options that they can take the meat out with no problem. Will definitely be back. Thank you guys,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
3,Cameron A B.,"Columbus, OH",120,15,5.0,1.0,2016-09-21,"Manager didn't honor half price wings because the time of order (6:10pm) was later than my arrival time of 5:10pm. Manager was defensive and U accommodating. I'll never visit this location again. I do not recommend this location for veterans, nor bikers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
6,Cyndi E.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,4.0,2017-02-09,"We are here for dinner tonight. Our waitress was very attentive, outgoing making sure we had everything we needed. The managers walked around to make sure everyone was okay, they were helping bring out the food. Kevin ordered a brunch burger no ketchup came out with no egg and had ketchup, the manager right away had another made correctly for Kevin. I ordered a bacon onion burger which came out a to done and dry. I did not complain about it, when the manager came around and asked how was everything else I then told him. They have us a free dessert, and took off my complete ordered which I told him he did not have to do that. They apologize several times and offered to give me a new sandwich.  Very nice to know that they were going out of their way to make sure we was happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
2,Joseph S.,"Galloway, OH",8,115,56.0,1.0,2017-03-23,"Alright. It's been a while since I've reviewed anything, but this is what made me install Yelp on my new phone. I will add a photo for proof. My wife ordered the Classic Combo. Well, when she got to the chicken, it was raw. As I said, I will add the photo. The management and waitress was very apologetic and said the meal was in the house and offered to make another one. It's kind of hard to eat anything else after eating on raw chicken. She ate one and though it tasted funny and cut into the next one, but all of them were like that after cutting them open. Please check your chicken before you eat from this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
1,Rob M.,"Circleville, OH",182,271,1124.0,3.0,2017-07-12,We like the 2 for $20 menu choices and always substitute 2 Caesar salads for our appetizer choice. Always good service in the bar area and we always seem to get better service in the bar !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
0,Janelle S.,"Cincinnati, OH",45,11,,5.0,2017-09-01,Never disappoints me! Drinks and appetizers are always great. They forgot my pretzels and they gave them to us for free! Casual place that I go all the time. There's never a long wait for a table. The watermelon sangrias are good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbus-32,,,,,
