74,Patrick N.,"Killeen, TX",7,34,1.0,5.0,2015-10-29,"Food was great. I had the turkey burger as that is my usual preference. Burger came fully dressed as requested with cheddar cheese and had a wonderful char-broiled taste and texture. The complimentary onion ring tower was really good, however I prefer ketchup to the two sauces provided. Fries came with the burger and those were way above average with a semi-crispy exterior and a puffy ""baked potato"" texture inside. My wife had a patty melt which she anointed as the ""Best Ever."" Our server, Jessica was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu which was great since this RR location had just opened the day before our visit. Yummmm! - FYI: Our visit was a pre-opening training run. I was pleased to see that the public was allowed to partake rather than just the usual ""dignitaries.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=60,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124
98,J. W.,"Killeen, TX",6,21,7.0,5.0,2015-10-30,"Beyond impressed..!!! If you're in the area looking for a new place to spend your cash, this is it..!! Extremely accommodating service from the front desk staff, personable waiters, courteous management and the food... Oh my goodness out of this world excellent. To start, the milkshake was delicious, the onion rings were perfectly crunchy and the dipping sauce is something spectacular, the whisky burger was quoted as ""the best burger I've ever had in my life"" and the southern burger with brown sugar and candid bacon was finger licking delicious. I am just so pleased that Red Robin chose our little city. Driving by these past months all I could think of was ""not another burger joint"" however, after visiting their soft opening today, I can say that this is NOT your ordinary burger spot. It's a great place to take your family or a date. I even witnessed the staff escorting people to their cars due to the massive storm. I do hope they continue to keep up the fine service I experienced today. One more thing.... The restaurant was a comfortable temperature. Most of our area restaurants have the AC set on -32 degrees and I normally have to bring a throw or eat with my jacket on, nothing is more annoying than eating uncomfortably. Overall, I give this place a 5/5.

Charbroiled, delicious patty and fresh veggies...GRILLED bun...oh, my...burger heaven. The onion rings were superb, thick, crisp, yummy. My husband had a super gourmet burger with barbecue sauce and his audible sighs of pleasure were an indication of how much he enjoyed it. The ""bottomless"" fries were hot and fresh. My mother loved her fish and chips  (she shared--so good). If you like malts, these are the best. Root beer floats are just delish, too. Drinks were replenished promptly. And, as always, the service is superior--friendly, super competent, helpful. Big screen TV's in every corner. Very cool decor (artfully arranged bottles hanging from the ceiling). Families are welcomed, but great for date night, too. I have to say I have yet to visit a Red Robin and be disappointed. The management at this Killeen location seems to really be on top of everything...very friendly, approachable, and together. This was a training session, but we were treated and served the same way we always are in these restaurants--like royalty. So thrilled they are finally in our town!

70,Caleb M.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,6,,1.0,2015-11-02,"Poor service. Insanely long wait to be seated. Was told 25 minutes and it ended up being well over an hour. Just before being seated, I heard them telling people 40 minutes even though the crowd was twice as large as when I arrived. Manager did nothing about them underestimating the time despite multiple complaints. Manager even said they had this problem during their sneak peek and they have done nothing to rectify the situation  (such as opening the patio or the back room). It is a family oriented restaurant that more than half the space is taken by the bar area, and they are not allowed to seat families in the bar area.

I had a party of 13 at 6:30pm on opening night, and all factors considered, Red Robin rocked it. We were seated in an hour and fifteen minutes,  which is what they said it would take. The only things that made it not a perfect dinning experience was that our food didn't arrive at the same time, the bar didn't have Stella beer, and was really slow to get my drink out, and the table was not fully equipped with the normal condiments like sweeteners. But again, it was opening night! I give them slack for that, especially because the staff was really friendly and tried hard accommodate everyone and All of the food came out tasting great!

Our waiter SHAYLA was NOT engaging at all I guess she assumed that since my husband and myself were African American that were not going to tip her so she just took our food order, she never asked if we wanted water even though we had alcoholic beverages, never checked on us to see if we needed anything and didn't explain the self order/checkout zoosk worked, she didn't even ask us if we wanted desert. The food on the other hand for being my first time trying Red Robins was excellent and cooked very well.

We sat here for 20 minutes before my wife decided to ask for someone. The waitress said that the person responsible for providing us the service we came for was to busy doing other things. Food might be good but to wait for substandard service is unacceptable. Go to billy bobs burgers if you would like a good burger and amazing service. I had enough time to create a Yelp account to tell you the public about this. I still have not received my food. I sat down at 9:00 and it's now 9:50. Everyone is sitting around me with their faces resting in their palms. This place needs to get itself together. Read the review from ""Caleb m."". He speaks the truth. Just got my food. After closing at 10:18. 10:30 update: I am giving this place another two stars purely on the managers sincerity. I asked to speak with him and to explained to me the situation at hand. He took over as my server and gave us our food for free. The food was decent.

We almost got up and left before we received our food but we decided to speak to the manager. The manager Billy was very nice and apologized about our wait and took care of our bill.

If you substitute your steak fries with sweet potatoes fries, they'll charge you extra. They won't tell you about these extra charges. I did not see it on the tablet or on the menu but it did end up on my bill.  About the food. The food is mediocre. It was nothing great.

99,C C.,"Killeen, TX",1,71,,3.0,2015-11-22,"This restaurant just opened at the beginning of November. I have been here 5 times this month. I sat both at a table and the bar during this month.  First a review of my food and drink selections. My favorite dish is the Ensenada Chicken Platter. The chicken was perfectly cooked and spiced (I love spice). The chicken was accompanied by a salad that was both fresh and flavorful. I also loved the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich as well as the salad of the same name. The Prime Rib Dip was edible, but nothing great. There was some gristle, and the meat was slightly tough. As for accompaniments, I usually substitute cole slaw for the fries. The cole slaw was good except for the time I got an order that was just shredded cabbage. I also got a Name That Burger. The burger was cooked as per my request. It was moist. Other than that, I didn't care for the burger because it was too bland for me. There was way too much sauce on the burger. For a drink, I had the unsweetened raspberry tea. It is made with Monin syrup which is one of my favorite brands. It was good. I also had the Fresh Lime Skinny Margarita which I chose to have on the rocks. You can also get it frozen. I love that drink. It was fresh, flavorful, and not too sweet. Be sure to ask for salt on the rim. Now for the service. Be prepared to wait...for everything. If you are in a hurry, go to another restaurant. There is a long wait for food. I asked for customizations on all of my orders. It was right 50% of the time. The best service I had was at the bar during dinner. There is a bartender who is truly amazing--Alyssa. She got my food and drink orders right, and she works as quickly and efficiently as she can. She also had to ring me out because there weren't enough pads for all the customers at the bar. Unfortunately, there was still a lot of waiting because they needed another person behind the bar to wait on customers--at least on Friday night. The worst service I had was at the bar during lunch which was much less crowded than dinner. I wasn't given a pad so I had to rely on the bartender to ring me out. First, she couldn't figure out how to do a gift card, and then she couldn't figure out how to get the membership number on the bill so I got credit for the visit. I called customer service when I got home to resolve that issue. Hopefully, service will improve with training and experience.

Waited 20 minutes for a table which was typical for Killeen. When we got seated we waited another 10 minutes for our waitress. The restaurant cleared out quite a bit by the time our waitress showed up. She asked if we had been there before and and we told her that my wife had, but I and my son had not. She went over the reward program, which we informed her we already were members and that we should have our names in the system. She explained the free birthday burger and I told her it was my birthday, and asked if I would be receiving my free burger to which she rudely told me that since it was my birthday, that the staff was ""going to embarrass the hell out me"". I told her not to. Which she complied. We ordered drinks and waited 10 minutes to receive, and had to wait more time so the waitress could sing happy birthday to another table. We waited another 25 minutes for our food. Then waited another 10 minutes for fry sauce, 10 minutes after ordering a refill, received no refills on our bottomless fries, then took another 20 minutes to get our check.

33,Robin A.,"Waco, TX",0,54,78.0,3.0,2016-12-06,I love this place the food is amazing but I was a little thrown off with the cleanliness of the restaurant last night. When we got to the booth the seats were really wet from the cleaning towel they used and the table was wet as well so my first thought was ew they whipped the table with the same towel they wiped the seat with. It felt gross touching the table with our arms cause the table was still wet but it dried. The waitress was great she brought us silverware and we got them and there was food all over the knife.... and the forks looked really blotchy with dried water stains. We asked for new ones and she apologized nicely. Then we got our food and the plates looked really messy as well. Again with the blotchy dried water stains... the food was good but I kept thinking about how they probably just spray the plates and silverware with water and not even use soap and stuff to clean the dishes.... I dunno I just thought I'd post about this just so the person in the back will try harder.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.508,2.72
35,Geoff C.,"Fort Hood, TX",3,9,,5.0,2016-12-14,"I'm here at Red Robin right now enjoying my lunch, Killeen, Texas.  I decided to give a review immediately so your excellent server, Erika, might get recognition for a good review  before her shift is over.  I stopped coming to this Red Robin because service has been poor since this location first opened.  I only came in today because of a 1/2 off coupon I received by email. The food is delicious as it usually is, but a server who checks up on me, refills my water without having to find the server and who doesn't seem put out when I request something is representative of a great server; a server who should be the model of all armed Robin servers.  That server is Erika, and I will return so long as I get her for a server or someone with her impeccable serving traits. If this experience is just a fluke and I come back to the typical servers here who usually have their ""entitlement"" personality then I will only come back when you offer 1/2 off coupons as bad service at full price is not a value to me and my family.

8,Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,221,325.0,4.0,2017-06-06,"I first discovered this place back when I was living in North Carolina. So when I saw that Harker Heights had one of these, I just knew I had to get my hands on a mushroom Swiss burger to-go. I don't remember if they had it before. But now online ordering is a thing. And it's easier to use than that of Yahgi's pizza. But...I digress. Customization was easy and you can even order extra fries, in case you aren't able to enjoy their ""bottomless fries"" feature; which is only available dining in. Oh, and if you haven't been to this place before, you have GOT to try the sweet n' spicy ketchup with the fries. It's literally the only time I ever dip my fries in any kind of ketchup so...that should say something. The burger was as tasty as I remember it. One minor complaint is have is how quickly the bun can get soggy, especially if you ordered to-go with no lettuce. So I guess the tip here is: if you're gonna order a burger to-go, be sure to get one with lettuce on the bottom to protect the bun. Other than that, I'd safely say Red Robin is as good as they were in NC. I'd give them 4 steak fries dipped in sweet n' spicy ketchup out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

7,Mark R.,"Killeen, TX",1,17,49.0,1.0,2017-07-23,"My wife and I by fluke tried this location given that we are somewhat fond of good all American food and ""gourmet"" burgers like Guy Fieri onboard Carnivals ships but given our current location we were a bit limited in options and decided to give it a try. Boy it was a rude awakening, we were highly mistaken. Our experience took place on July 23, 2017 between 5pm to 6:48pm. The waiter was Elisa, the quality and service was worst than drive thru to include other competitive chains with substandard food quality.  I ordered a Smokey BBQ tavern double burger  that astonishingly required to be done three times because they either didn't know the difference between cheddar and pepperjack cheeses; randomly changed the type of buns and finally took out ingredients as if they were treating how many variables they can produce with food products and condiments.  Not trying to nick pick but they cycled through different burger buns as if it was randomly. I initially ordered onion grilled buns but somehow they changed the bread in round 2 when corrected and removed their BBQ sauce from the Smokey ""BBQ"" burger....in round 3. They slapped a burger that was not what I ordered and it only took about over an hour and 20 minutes to receive.  I had to request their sauce after the third try and created their Smokey BBQ double burger in my table given that either there is no communication in the back or their employees are completely illiterate.  I purposely did not mention how rude individuals were when they brought out my order. It appeared as a manager or supervisor brought out my burger in ciabatta bread and I politely inform her that that couldn't be my burger given that it was ordered in grilled onion buns and the only incorrect thing previously was the cheese. She then said your waiter requested this because you ordered it like this then walked away angry.  The waiter Elisa then mentioned, ""oh, I did request ciabatta bread,uh..."" Then walked away.  How is the customer at fault for the waiter not doing the basic elementary duties of writing down an order and then reciting or inputting it in their system correctly. I'm not going to waste time going into depth of how there was no service i.e. our drinks ran empty three times while we waited for our food and twice while we ate.  In regards to the dessert, they were modifying or check and we were not even able to order dessert through the table kiosk machine.  Elisa didn't return/service our table after the second incorrect order and we had to flag her when she was attending other tables to get any drinks and to order dessert. We ordered the dessert to go. Don't waste your time, the only pleasant encounter was with a nice lady that brought us the Smokey BBQ sauce that wad supposed to be in the burger. She deserves the star, the service and food quality doesn't deserve a single one.  Funny this is that after leaving both muy wife and I got sick. Nausea, etc. Don't waste your time or money in this establishment.

I was so excited! Not many spots out here have that, so I immediately knew I HAD to try it. Let. Me. Tell. You!

It gets me a free burger on my birthday and they have some really good fries. But this location is on the brink of being closed down. You can tell by the limited staff to keep costs down. The lack of knowledgeable staff possibly due to retention turnover from tenured staff. The lack of care for patrons. Here's an example: before I signed in to write this review a special was available at this location but I was not offered it while purveying the Killeen location. Our bartender was amiable but that's where the buck stops, unfortunately. She wasn't rude in any way shape or form, she was just a bartender. She tended bar. She wasn't there to serve or take care of her guests by any means. My iced tea was done before my appetizer and was only offered one upon asking for our closing tab. Our bottomless fries took two requests to arrive. I wanted a beer but didn't have any face time to actually ask what beers they had to see if they could accommodate my black and tan request. They weren't slammed but they weren't exactly slow either but the time spent in the kitchen by the staff instead of the floor felt more like a UFC Fight Night or major NFL event taking place. No such luck with any type of good service, which is a shame because my best friend used to work here and make quite a living. Seems like the genuine service left with him.  I will take my business to the Cedar Park or Round Rock location because I have very little if any complaints or qualms with them. Even if a bit of a drive away.

I had to wait for the waiter to come back and when I told him he said he told them in the back as well as writing it. My boyfriends food was right but mine had to be taken back and it came back out pretty quickly so in my head I did question it but was just going to take a bite but something stopped me. I lifted my bun and moved the lettuce to the side some and seen the tomato seeds in it then when I pushed the lettuce completely off I could see the ring in my cheese where the cook had just pulled the tomato off and sent it back out. I am severely allergic to tomatoes I carry an epipen with me, but that does not help much as I have had to be rushed to hospital and my stomach pumped as well as getting a breathing tube in past experiences.
