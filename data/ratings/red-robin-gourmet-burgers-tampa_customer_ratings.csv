Where to start ..... the bottomless fries never happened on any of my visits. Is that not your big slogan? and you dont come through ... not a good move. The burgers are meh but not worth $10. The wait staff slow, unattending and forgetful. We had to keep asking for drinks ohhh and the bottomless fries which we got after we finished our burgers. Just bad service, mediocre food and long waits for drinks and orders.

78,Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5409.0,4.0,2012-01-23,"I've grubbed down here twice over the past year, and I'm a fan.  First time around, I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and nachos.  Oddly enough, I was more impressed by the nachos than the burger.  I think because I was expecting the nachos to suck :) The burger was good, juicy and plenty big.  Plus, they got the whole bottomless fried thing going on, so I didn't leave hungry by any stretch of the imagination.  And to top it all off, they serve Blue Moon.   I went back this weekend and ordered the guacamole bacon Swiss burger, and it was fantastic.  The combination of those 3 condiments sounds horrific as hell, but I've got to say I was pleasantly surprised by how well they complimented each other.  Next time I go, this will be the burger of choice. Best burger in the Bay?  No.  Better than your standard fast food burger?  Mos def!

If you want to step up from Burger King and McDonalds, give Red Robin a try.  They have a really nice selection of burgers with a ""pink or no pink option"".  I got a Monster Burger (two patties) with pink.  It was very good.  The onion tower was impressive.  They also have sweet potato fries if regular steak fries are not your thing. If they are your thing, you're in luck.  They are bottomless, all you can eat.  The shakes and the sundae were not very impressive.  I'd pass on those.

99,Ben O.,"Monroe, LA",293,577,539.0,1.0,2012-09-24,"There were more tables empty than in use this afternoon, but the service was unconscionably slow. The cheese dip congealed while we waited for more fries, and I had to stack empty drink glasses a cubit high before the manager noticed anything was wrong.  We should have left at the beginning, when the greeter tried to prevent my wife from sitting opposite me and had the nerve to ask ME if my wife would be willing to have her wheelchair shoved between tables. The woman's got a master's degree in philosophy and this greeter asks ME? Oh hell no. You want to know whether a customer is willing to do something uncomfortable, you ask her directly. Don't compound your error by acting as if people who use wheelchairs can't answer your questions for themselves. The food's good, but Wesley Chapel and Brandon have Red Robins WITH good service.

95,Jeff E.,"Tampa, FL",15,73,11.0,4.0,2012-11-17,"Red Robin is a guilty pleasure of mine. Everything is for the most part fried, and never ending fries will make you stuff your self.  The food is excellent. They have fairly cheap appetizers, and most of them are better then average. The onion rings are extremely good and usually are nice and crispy when they come out. The burgers are great, and they do a lot of takes on burgers that you won't find at any other restaurant. This isn't going to be just your normal blue cheese burger, bbq burger, and bacon burger. I've never come here and had anything that tasted bad. The service at times can be questionable and its the only thing that stops this from being a five star review. If you go in there when it is busy, expect to wait slightly longer for anyone to come by to check on you, take plates, or refill drinks. Its never been so bad that I wouldn't come back, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can be inconvenient. I do give warning for people looking for a more intimate dining setting. This is a very family friendly restaurant and there will be lots of commotion going on, especially if there are any large groups with children. As long as you are willing to be a little laid back though, it actually enhances the experience. Overall, I really recommend Red Robin for anyone who is looking for a great burger, and not at your typical bar setting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=80,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003
52,Nichole C.,"Tampa, FL",117,125,124.0,3.0,2012-11-30,"Sadly RR gets a three from this kid. What I like: their salads, wings and guac are delish! I know they are known for burgers but the few times I have ordered a burger, I've found them just okay. Not terrible but not ah-mazing, and something I must have when I go on. That being said, tonight the hubs and I went and the service was pretty terrible, HOWEVER, my burger was for once truly ah-mazing (prime chophouse, YUM). We did come in after 9pm and so perhaps that was why, but there was no hostess and another server was sweet and sat us but kept saying, ""I don't know where the hostess is, she should be up here"", I will say while I have never served, I have been in customer service for a verrrry long time and CS 101 is just to take responsibility, I appreciated her seating us but didn't need anyone to point fingers at anyone else.  I went to the restroom once seated and after I returned, our server still had not come to take our drink order.Once we did order, it took a ridiculous amount of time for our food to come out and at one point our server was flirting with the girl at another table and talking about how he hated closing and someone didn't tip him and how if people can't afford to go out, they should visit McDonald's $ menu. I hate when I can hear things like that; I get the female patron was a server as well somewhere but I didn't need to here their convo while my food was taking forever to arrive. It was so unprofessional. The con: we don't think our server ever rang our order in. The pro: we never complained once, but the manager saw our long wait for dinner and comped our entire meal! Honestly, the food is decent, the service is so-so and while I would go back it seems like ever since this RR has opened, it has gone a bit downhill. I wouldn't seek them out any time soon, but I would return if in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=60,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

Because it was quite the disappointment.    ---   ---   --- I drove all the way to Citrus Park to eat at Red Robin a few days earlier... and embarrassingly ate at Johnny Rockets instead (on accident.) I have to say that Johnny Rockets was significantly a better burger. Red Robin had a more intriguing menu of burger options, but Johnny Rockets had a much juicier taste, with better service.  I went with the Prime burger that included horse radish sauce and mushrooms - totally up my alley. Unfortunately, I got a very small patty, too many mushrooms, and very little flavor, This burger was the opposite of ""juicy."" The service was friendly, but slow. There was about a 10 minute period where I never saw her. I didn't have napkins until I had already started eating. She corrected this, but overall, it just wasn't a good day for Red Robin.

Her excuse was that the bus boys only had one bucket to pick up the plates from the previous table. On top of all this she didn't even greet us or made us feel welcomed.  When we finally sat down at the table, the check from the previous table was still sitting there and the waiter took ten minutes to come to take our drink order.

53,Noelle L.,"Tampa, FL",270,258,199.0,2.0,2013-01-16,"So I'd like to preface by saying that the last time I had been to a Red Robin was in Ohio in my college days (2005ish). From what I remembered, the burgers were good and the endless fries were crispy and delicious.  So when I kept raving at their array of burger choices to my boyfriend, we finally made the hike up to Citrus Park Mall to grab a bite to eat and catch a flick at the adjacent theater.  We were seated right away. However, this is a family joint. I'm fairly confident that this is a ""bring your kids"" kinda place, because there were a few screaming/loud children in the establishment. This cannot be faulted by Red Robin by any means.  We got a server that was green... may have been his first day. Service was terrible, although he was new, so I again, do not blame Red Robin. I asked for my burger with no sauce, however, it came with sauce. We never got a refill of our unlimited fries either, and our drink glasses were empty and not refilled.  Aside from the service, the food did not live up to my expectations. There was not a lot of seasoning or flavor in the burgers. The cook did cook my burger perfectly though (med-rare), which I give props for.  I'd rather go to Square 1, Johnny Rockets, or even Champps for a burger before I'd come back here for one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=60,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

I ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad without cheese and dressing on the side, and my husband ordered a burger and fries. Our server checked on us frequently, and I didn't get charged for my side of fries, I guess because the server counted it as part of my husband's bottomless fries.

50,Nicole Leigh S.,"Tampa, FL",376,221,262.0,3.0,2013-03-23,"A long, long time ago, back when I was living in Michigan and in college (for the first time), I worked for Red Robin (don't click if you don't want to see meat stuffs). Surprisingly it was a great job. I liked the people I worked with, I enjoyed the food and the overall atmosphere. Then I went vegetarian,which might seem like a hard thing to do at a diner style burger joint, but it was okay because they served a Gardenburger (which does have milk products and egg, please beware!). Theeeennn I went vegan. Yet still! Nothing to fear. They offer a BOCA patty for all the little vegan girls and boys. Their FAQ says the following: ""Do you currently have vegan and/or vegetarian offerings on your menu?"" Yes. Most Red Robin restaurants in the U.S. offer both the BOCA Original Vegan Burger and a Gardenburger patty as meatless options for any burger or sandwich at no additional charge. In addition, we carry a wide range of salads and other entrees, which our Team Members will gladly customize to meet the dietary needs or preferences of our Guests. I still get caught up on the line, ""...which our Team Members will gladly customize to meet the dietary needs or preferences of our Guests."" - and they mean it! To be honest, eight years since I left my job at Red Robin, that's what I remember. A corporate company that somehow seems to still remember that the guests are the focal point, that not everyone is the same and some people make choices to be different, but everyone should have options and be accommodated. Not only that, but at the same cost. I often go to restaurants that carry a meat replacement for sandwiches and am charged $1.50-3.00 extra to substitute it, but not here. So yes, they serve meat, but yes they also serve vegan (and gluten free) options. Because I am as important as the next person as the next person is as important as I. There's a lesson to be learned here, so kudos RR. You've made me a repeat customer for life. :) Note: I 3 starred _this location_ not the company as a whole, which I 5 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=60,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

The bread was not fresh and the meat tasted like it was frozen. It just didn't really have any flavor. You can really taste the difference between fresh meat and frozen, like 5 guys... or even Wendys. The onion rings were very good and the dipping sauces were tasty.

Red Robin has the BEST STEAK FRIES EVERRRRRR.  If I was able to just eat a meal of strictly fries, I would be perfectly happy at RR.  The burgers are alright....but I prefer to have a burger at a steakhouse with a better quality of meat. RR's are also so loud all the time.  I don't mind noisy, but the level of loud in this place is so above the norm.  There just always seems to be the worst children in Tampa Bay come here for dinner, along with their worst parents who do absolutely nothing to get their kids under control.  I have had kids run past my chairs, knocking over my purse, bumping over drinks...even had one kid drop his food in my lap.  Yes, running by with a mouthful and handful of onion rings, he ran right into me and blarrrrgggghhhhh...all the food came out of his mouth and hands, into my lap. I naturally talked to the parents who just kind of shrugged it off and had junior sit back down.  No apology, nothing. By the second time the kid ran around our table and knocked my purse down again, I asked the manager to please, talk to the parents and ask them to get their herd under control.  He sure did, by LOUDLY announcing that ""THAT LADY OVER THERE SAID YOUR KID KEEPS RUNNING AROUND..."" etc etc.  Really, Dude?  Now, I am subjected to dirty looks and snarky remarks for the rest of my dinner.  Dinner, mind you, with my wonderfully behaved grandkids who sat in their seats the entire time.   Red Robin has its place in the universe, I'm sure.  It's an okay place to drop into after a day of shopping at the mall for a meal.  Not exactly a cheap meal...but a meal nevertheless.  I would give RR one star, if it wasn't for the damn fries.  Those frickin' fries.  They call to me in my sleep sometimes...but fortunately, I live far enough away that I have to just lie down til the feeling goes away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.6320000000000006,2.76

I ordered the Royal, a heaping burger with bacon in each bite, and a fried egg on top. Due to grease and salt factor is was too much with the bacon which was evicted immediately. You can't mess up a burger with an egg on it, but the fries looked great. I didn't need them, but they looked like long planks of steak fries just begging to be dipped ever so carefully in a soft patch of ketchup, but my eyes deceived me as the fries didn't taste as good as they looked. Maybe over cooked and hardened? I tried a soggy one...still not much to report. The slaw had huge cabbage chunks but they were dripping in sweet white mystery sauce. Way too much sauce, so gave up on em, and ordered a chicken tortilla soup which was probably the belle of the ball.

101,Ben M.,"New Port Richey, FL",5,70,,2.0,2013-12-08,"This place can be summed up in one word: Grease. Also two more words: Not fresh.  I ordered the special A1 peppercorn burger on an ""onion ciabatta bun"" with a special sauce and fried onion strips. Now since most of what they do is burgers, and they sure charge enough for them (over ten bucks), one would hope they could get it right, or at least sort of. At about four times the price of a Sonic burger it should be at least twice the quality, but sadly, no.  The ""onion ciabbatta"" was stale and tasteless with a few dark flecks of something on it that may have been onion. Or maybe just dirt. Anyway the bun was about as tasty as a folded up paper towel. The special pepper sauce had plenty of stale pepper but no other flavor. The bacon strips on it were okay, but the cheese was skimpy and along with a bit of tomato and lettuce added nothing. The deep fried onion strings were mushy and greased, too salty and had unchewable outer peels in it that should have been tossed out before cooking. The hamburger meat was greasy, but dry and had no juice in it, which means it was either cooked from frozen, and/or the cook stupidly squeezed the juices out of it on the grill. It was overcooked for what I had ordered and did not have a good taste. All of this was squished together into a greasy mess. I enjoy hamburgers, but halfway through it this thing was making me gag and I just couldn't finish it. As a side, I chose the sweet potato fries. They were tasteless, obviously from frozen, mushy and greasy. It seems there are things on the menu like salads that may not be as greased, so the place might be okay to have a drink or two and a side snack of salad or soup.

I don't eat a lot of carbohydrates, so when I order something, I will ask for special requests... which is what I did when I stopped into this location with my friend Dani. We arrived, we sat immediately and noticed that they'd done some recent remodeling. When we asked how long ago they'd done it, we were told a year ago.  We knew it'd been more recent than that, but I guess that was the time frame they were telling people. *shrug* We both ordered something with a customization to it. My friend ordered the cobb salad, no tomatoes, dressing on the side. Me, I ordered the soup/salad combo, the southwestern salad, no jalapeno coins (Allergy) and dressing on the side.  Our food came.. for some reason, the salads were taking a -very- long time.  Anway, when they came, the soup was fantastic, but my salad was very.. very .. wet.  like soupy wet. A puddle at the bottom of the bowl also showed that there was dressing on it, as it wasn't clear fluid. I was sorely disappointed.  I called my waitress over and she apologized profusely, she took it back to the kitchen and immediately had the manager come over. He had them re-make the salad for me, and he also took it off the bill (something he didn't have to do at all, but I'm thankful he did.)

The seating arrangements were odd, and given the reservations and the size of our party you would think they wouldn't be cramming 8 people into a booth with no way to get out.

And seriously, careful with those unlimited steak fries. Those things are addictive. Some of their drinks are ""bottomless"" too, including the strawberry lemonade I ordered.

68,Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020.0,3.0,2014-07-02,"The concept behind the Red Robin restaurant chain is good, however the execution varies widely by location and by staff on duty. I've had some great experiences, and some forgettable experiences, so I'll round it out to three stars. The Red Robin story started way back in the 1940's when Sam's Tavern opened near the University of Washington. Sam, the owner, was known to sing ""When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)"" with his barbershop quartet. He loved the song so much that he changed the name of his restaurant to Sam's Red Robin. And that my friends is how this burger joint ended up with the 'Red Robin' name -- odd, but true. Fast forward to today, and the chain is approaching 500 locations nationwide. Fresh and unique burgers are their mainstay, but the menu also offers soups, salads, wraps, and a sampling of entrées including fried seafood, fried chicken, French dip sandwiches, and some Mexican-themed dinners. Most people are here for the burgers, and Red Robin offers plenty of options with fire-grilled beef patties and a big diversity of toppings. You always have the option of ordering one of their standard burger selections off the menu, or you can customize the heck out of your meal to adjust for tastes, allergens, and nutritional values. On this trip I ordered the Black and Bleu Burger which was a burger with sautéed, blackened Portobello mushrooms, grilled onions, house-made Bleu cheese sauce and Bleu cheese crumbles on a toasted ciabatta bun with Dijon sauce. As the menu said, this is truly a knife-and-fork burger as it was impossible to hold the burger in your hands without the sauce dribbling down. Messy, but tasty. I generally ask for my burgers to be cooked medium in the hopes of having a pink center to the meat. More often than not the burgers are cooked closer to well done, and I often have to send it back to be re-made. Surely the grill masters should know the difference between medium and well done, and should make the effort to prepare the burgers according to the customer's request.  Add to that the fact that this location inside of the Westfield Citrus Park Mall can be hit or miss on restaurant cleanliness and attentiveness of the staff. You shouldn't have to see French fries squished on the floor next to your table, nor should you have to flag down another server to get your check because your original server has gone M.I.A. Seems to me that all of these concerns are training and management issues which could and should be addressed. I like the menu at Red Robin, and I am hoping that this location steps up their game. They could could easily be a lot better than three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.572,3.2400000000000007
49,Cari P.,"Tampa, FL",27,119,93.0,2.0,2014-07-02,"First, I have to say that burgers are by far my favorite food. I would eat a burger for every meal every day if I could. I'm not talking gourmet fancy burgers either, I can get down with a greasy burger in any hole in the wall place anytime.  So I was pretty excited to check out Red Robin, having never lived near one before I never tried before moving to Tampa. This was one of my most disappointing burger experiences ever. They really hype you up with their ""yum"" commercials and their full burger menu, but once you get the food it's pretty much McDonald's status. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy McDonald's in a pinch, at McDonald's prices(can't argue with the dollar menu). But the quality of the meat is just not there, and without that you can stack as much pineapple or jalapeno or eggs or whatever other ""unique"" toppings you want on a burger but it just isn't going to work. I don't want to pay restaurant burger prices for what I feel is a $1 burger. The only good thing I had was the onion rings, if I'm ever in the mall and need to grab something to eat I'd probably consider going just for the onion ring tower. But for burgers I'd rather spend half as much money and get fast food. The service was good and it's worth a try if you're at the mall and don't want to eat anything else there, but I'm really not a picky eater and the food just didn't do it for me at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.504,3.1600000000000006

For example, the bottomless French Fries are one of the best things about this chain, but at this location the Fries are almost ALWAYS under-cooked. Soggy steak fries are not good and even if you ask them to ""over-cook"" your fries they don't...they just bring you the same soggy, overly potatoey fries.

Now the burger.  I was a little skeptical about this one but surprisingly it was fabulous.  The sweetness of the brown sugar cooked into the burger and the candied bacon were fantastic.  The ciabatta bun was fresh and the flavor a just melted together.  I ordered it medium and it came out perfect.  This burger is a winner. Our waitress was extremely accommodating and was always checking on us.  We did have a table right near the bar so it was rather crowded with people coming in for to go orders.  Will choose a different set next time. Overall it was a great experience.  I will defiantly be going there again.  Plus the price was very reasonable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,3.152,2.84

We have been here before for appetizers and wasn't really impressed but say some great pic on yelp of their burgers lol. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away and  beers came out fast. Our server wasn't bad but wasn't the greatest. Didn't really have much of a personality and had dry jokes that had my girlfriend and I laughing at him instead of the jokes :)  Back to the food...they had a lot of new specialty burgers priced $12.99 and up but I ordered the Royal Red Robin which was a burger, bacon, fried egg, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. I subbed the bacon with the candied bacon from the Southern Charmed Burger for a $1 up charge and it was worth it. The fried egg burger was definitely not the best I've had nor was it in the top 5 but the bacon helped. I could honestly say the best part of my meal was the sweet potato fries. My girlfriend ordered the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) croissant. I didn't get a chance to taste it but she enjoyed it. Would I go back?

I've always liked Red Robin but haven't been here in a while until I came her for lunch.

I like their new digital Ziosk, which is a miniature computer that shows you all the food + drinks. You can call your server over, order food, and pay. Now this is what I thought 2015 would look like!  The restaurant decor has been re-designed with a more modern and upscale  feeling.

You know, the usual, they fill up your drink without you asking and the bottomless fries keep on coming. However, if I could rate my experience yesterday with negative stars, I would.  Yesterday we went to Red Robin at Citrus Park mall to grab a quick bite before my mom had to head back home. We were there for over an hour and a half due to the service. Our server, Justin, might possibly be the worst server I've ever encountered. From the initial introduction where we were trying to decide what drugs he was on to his ""not-so-witty"" comments throughout the meal. We asked for silverware because he didn't bring us any even though our appetizers came out. (We also had to ask him to bring our appetizer after we sat there for 20 minutes.) He returned with two steak knifes, however, there were three of us dining. We asked if we could also have forks and he was like ""Aw man... You're not going to believe this... But we're all out. They're being washed now, so at least you'll know they'll be clean."" I asked if we could have another knife in the meantime to which he replied ""oh man, you caught me"". Whatever that's supposed to mean. We had to ask for water/soda every time and it would take him 10-15 minutes to bring it (if he did). We also waited close to 20 minutes for a refill of fries. Finally, towards the end of the meal the manager came over to see how everything was going. When we told him about the terrible service he thought we were joking. Once we got him to believe us, he took great care of us.

She offered the upsell to the larger draft Stella - only a dollar more...and then after pouring one apologized for not having a clean second glass. She took the time to wash it and fill it with ice water to chill it before filling it, rather than just offering a substitution or perhaps even two smalls?

Today 10 places dirty, one of which could have sat all of us. 2 tables could have been cleaned and placed right next to each other for us. Last time I don't remember how many were dirty but there were several. And we had a party of 7. We were told a wait of 25 minutes for a table and waited while staff chatted with each other. The hostess repeatedly flipped her hair and did nothing else. No one was busing any of the tables for 10 minutes. Then when I made a comment the hostess tried to clean a table or two while we waited. The side door was a hit for everyone working there but the tables were not.  It took them 15 minutes to get us seated and 10 minutes to attempt to clean it when on a slow day/time.

I try to attend as many burger restaurants as I can because burgers are the true source of joy in life (sorry people with kids). I tend to prefer small businesses over chain restaurants but Red Robin always hit the spot. Reason number one: you get unlimited fries. The second I sit down I ask the waiter/waitress to bring me fries, I don't even let them ask me how my day is going (may or may not be a joke). Second: they serve 24 oz beers and have a great selection. Third: the food is good. The burgers are consistent in every location you go and it always tastes good. And lastly, even if you don't really like your food, go back to my second reason. Two of those 24 oz beers before your meal and you won't even care how the burgers taste like anyways.

While waiting for our food I watched him stop by a table of two very pretty ladies and chat them up quite a bit making sure their experience was good. Once our food arrived the manager made a point to check on the couple and their children in the booth  behind us, He then looked at our table looked away quickly, and walked and checked on the booth of 3 in front of us.  He never bothered to talk to us. We are two young adults (28), white, heterosexual couple. So I don't think it's prejudice based on that. Maybe it was based on the fact we were both wearing black shirts and jeans? Punk Esq? Who knows. Maybe we didn't order enough for him to give a Fuck? Who knows, but I can tell you he didn't care. He blatantly knew he was skipping us, he looked straight at us.  I'm disappointed to say the least. Not sure his name but this occured on July 8th at 3:30 pm.

I asked to speak to a manager to let him know that waiting 10 minutes for a server is ridiculous, especially since I also am a server. I also let the manager know that if he gets mystery shoppers it wouldn't look good to which he told me it's none of my business and that he wants to focus on my experince.

They also have nice salads, entrees and other sandwiches. They have a pretty good appetizer menu and very tasty milkshakes as well. I had dinner there tonight and as usual the food was pretty good. I had the prime rib French dip. Although, the first one I got wasn't quite perfect. However the manager got me a new one right away and it was great. In addition they gave us some fries while we waited for a food to come. And the manager was very apologetic about the fact that my food wasn't quite right when I first got it.

36,Josie I.,"Tampa, FL",12,32,41.0,1.0,2017-03-20,"First I want to say we come to red Robin often and we always have great service. Tonight we had a waitress that we have not seen before,  we don't know her name because she never introduced herself , so we will just call her she. She came to the table with an attitude which I just blew off as she's having a bad night even though every time she walked away from our table we could see her visibly making nasty faces and rolling her eyes. Even then we were still gracious and kind to her. In fact the ruder she was the nicer we were to her! My sons burger was put in wrong by her ( no biggie it happens) she obviously went and told the manager a different story about it but we just rolled with it and said thank you and how much we appreciated it being fixed. The manager came by our table and was lovely. We were lovely back to him . My daughter asked for a to go cup , waitress told my daughter in a way  I cannot even convey with words how rude she was about it , she didn't think they had any left and went to go check , again rolling her eyes visibly as she walked away. After she bought the cup for my daughter she left so quickly I didn't even have time to ask her for the check . We ended up waiting another 15 minutes before I was finally able to stop her and ask for it. I've never had a waitress  to speak so rude to me and in the tone she did. All I did was ask her for the check & nicely I might add. She literally said just leave it on the table and I told her  I'm paying cash I need the check . She replied just leave it on the table I told you just to leave it on the table and she literally walked away. We waited a few more minutes as I looked through my purse . I knew I didn't have the exact change so unfortunately she was left just a dollar over what the bill was I think. I did stop her and talk to her on the way out just to let her know that she was the reason she didn't get a tip and I would have loved to have given her one but she didn't give me the opportunity. Sleep I've always left a review even one service isn't that great at a restaurant. She would've gotten a tip to ...even know she was so incredibly rude to us throughout the whole dinner. I get having a bad day but this goes way beyond that. I am just stunned and I know that my review doesn't really convey how she treated us. It's bad enough to know that when you're eating out your server is making faces talking about you and doesn't treat you kindly but this just is unbelievable!!  This was at 9ish on March 20th....Sure I've had experiences with waitresses that leave a bad taste in your mouth but this goes above and beyond that !! I have no understanding of why someone would come to you throughout your whole entire dinner and talk to you in that manner!! It makes literally no sense,  especially when we're being especially kind to you. Would love to have left you the standard 15% tip, don't even give me the opportunity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa?start=20,3.56,3.11,3.11,,3.29

I ordered some fried pickles to start with along with the smoky jack burger.  Red Robin has done a really good job of creating a value menu. They have appetizers that aren't overly expensive and smaller burgers that are priced under double digits. Sometimes you don't want an enormous burger and they make that possible.  The fried pickles were very good and not overly breaded or greasy. The burger was a great size for a ""smaller"" portion. It was cooked to my liking and was seasoned very well. The steak fries served with it were good and they are bottomless so you can get as many as you want.  I like chain restaurants because the quality control and food is mostly consistence and you know what you are getting.

Red Robin has a nice air conditioned indoor patio with a view of mall patrons  passing by, a large bar with a sparkling unique maroon style granite, and plenty of TV's for watching sports. I sat at the bar where I was promptly greeted by the bartender who gave me a menu. It was tough finding the right burger as there was a whopping 3 pages of burgers but my bartender steered me in the right direction. I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger which came with pepper jack cheese, pepper seasoned bacon, crispy onions, lettuce, and tomato. I added sautéed onions, mushrooms, and jalapeños to the burger to give it a little sizzle and quite a kick! For the fries, I got a side of Chipotle and honey mustard in addition to the ketchup which paired quite nicely. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out perfect with a touch of pink, was quite tender, and the condiments were all great. The burger was so big I could barely eat it, but I managed! My bartender even came by to ask if I wanted more fries which has never ever happened to me before and I thought that was a nice touch. Wrapping up the bill was a quick process as well. There are plenty of parking spaces on site available in the citrus mall parking lot by the food court area that is not on the side of the movie theaters.

Not to mention you just can't go wrong with the bottomless fries!! My visits to Red Robin often take place at the Wesley Chapel location. This particular visit I ended up at the Citrus park location because I was meeting up with a friend. Well, my visit to this location was lacking. My Boca burger was fine but the bun was dreadful! I could tell the bread was reaching its expiration date. I asked for guacamole on my burger and I was provided with a tiny amount. I couldn't even taste it. My Friend and I had to keep trying to hunt down our waitress to get service. To end things when it came time to pay we had to use the tablet type machine at the table. These machines are frustrating! I am very tech savvy but I found the machines to be a total inconvenience. I understand the machines are a relief for the servers and takes some of the stress of their jobs, but there has to be a better more customer friendly way to check out.

19,Sam V.,"Tampa, FL",67,76,58.0,2.0,2017-07-22,"In my opinion, Red Robin is one of those things that people ""brand crave"" rather than ""food crave."" However, when Red Robin comes to mind, I do think of decent burgers, good french fries, and friendly service. However, it's been two strikes - so far - at this particular Red Robin location.  My most recent dining experience was a big disappointment. I ordered the ""bottomless"" parmesan fries. I can see that the reason why they offer ""bottomless"" fries is because they serve you about 6 or 7 french fries up front, and by the time the server comes around to asking if you want a refill, you've already finished the rest of your meal, so it's a moot point. I was here around the post-dinner rush, so around 7:30-8p - hardly crowded. My server apologized for taking longer than expected to take our drink order. She didn't seem too busy, except for the fact that she was behind the counter with her coworkers socializing. She had one other table to attend to, and while it was a party of around 6 or 7 people, it didn't seem particularly difficult to attend to one more table. And when I asked one of her coworkers to refill my drink and my ""bottomless"" fries, it almost seemed like I was disturbing her social hour, as well. (I got a little bit of the self-entitlement attitude I've come to expect from the New Millennial generation. Don't worry, you're still pretty.) The fries were incredibly greasy. The parmesan cheese hardly tasted cheesy. The chicken sandwich I had was not bad.  I hesitate giving this Red Robin another shot. Management seems aloof to the ongoing problems with this particular location. I know - it's a burger chain restaurant, what could one possibly expect? Then again, Red Robin has always had a ""cheery"" marketing edge, and it's acutally one of the top 5 places I think of when I think of ""good burger chain."" However, the brand itself needs to remove some of its rotten apples - such as this particular location. If you're looking for a good Red Robin experience - i.e., fresh french fries, friendly service, and good burgers - then travel a bit farther for a better Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa,3.44,3.16,3.16,,3.2720000000000007

Last night really was the last straw.  The waiter was the same ""Michael"" we had gotten on our last occasion, July 19.  We weren't impressed with his abilities then and we are certain we would not have him wait on us again.  Imagine, being served ""iced tea"" -- without any ice.  When he saw I pushed it to the edge of the table without drinking it, Michael came over and revealed that the restaurant had run out of ice.  (That's odd.  We kept seeing other wait staff go by with iced drinks.)  He apologized and asked if I wanted something else.  ""Sure, if the beer is free.""  It came, complimentary.  It was the only thing I could be sure of that would be served cold.  (Incidentally, it was Miller Light, and it had a markedly ""skunky"" taste.  Yuk.) My partner ordered the regular Tavern Double burger.  And just like the last time, she immediately requested the ""spicy ketchup.""  Once again, Michael forgot to deliver it.  And again, he laughed it off -- like it was some sort of joke and of no consequence.  In all, her burger was acceptable and the fries were good.  However, she was often interrupted by Michael as she used the boothside kiosk to enter information for our membership in the Red Royalty (loyalty) program, and to pay with a credit card.  Michael, apparently, didn't think she was capable of pushing the buttons. In my case, after numerous past disappointments with -- of all things -- their HAMBURGERS, I settled for grilled salmon.  What was served was a slightly overcooked, minuscule filet (maybe 4 oz.), a ridiculous ""dab"" of cole slaw, and some supposedly ""endless"" steamed broccoli.  I had noticed that the first glass of the peach iced tea was slightly warm in the glass -- because it wasted no time in melting what little ice was provided. Regretfully, I was never offered more broccoli, even after I had consumed all that had been given me.  Note:  Red Robin is one of the  few restaurants that is capable of actually serving hot, perfectly steamed broccoli.  Too bad I couldn't have received more. On one prior occasion, we talked to the friendly manager who was making his rounds -- asking patrons how they enjoyed their meal.  Back then, we raved to him that ""Red Robin knows how to do it right.""  This time, it was clear there wasn't even a manager in sight, as multiple tables were left with dirty dishes for the entire length of our stay. Loyalty Club?  Hrumph.  I think it may be a long time before we return to Red Robin, when so many other choices exist for a decent burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa,3.44,3.17,3.17,,3.278

Parking lot is pretty full so we had a walk in the cold to get to the door. Walked in three greeters at the front desk- one walked us to our table and with in a minute- our server Mannon  arrived.  Since it was not cold inside the guys ordered a cream soda float with free refills. The float showed up on the table in a flash. I had a veggie burger with , deep fried mushroom, pepper jams, avocado, lettuce and Swiss. The Royal burger and the Mad Dog were next to arrive along with a few orders of fries. Food was served fast with a smile. Great burgers cooked well. Clean restrooms. Bill can be paid on the kiosk on the table - which is very customer friendly. Join the rewards program get a fee burger after u buy 10 , which is easy when u have a family. Using our discount voucher never presented a problem and we we done in under an hour and off the walk outside in the moonlight. Big improvements at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tampa,3.28,3.22,3.22,,3.2440000000000007
