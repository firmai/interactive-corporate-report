I order the Bonsai burger every time.  It's got a grilled pineapple on it, and that makes it healthy--almost like a fruit cup.   I've always had pleasant service here and this is probably one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to if you need to eat out and you've got a picky kid with you. In fact the last time I was here with my then 6 year old cousin, he ordered the chicken strips and then hugged the waitress and told her they were the best thing he had ever had to eat, ever.   While I haven't found Red Robin to be HUG THE WAITRESS good, these burgers are terribly good, and then they are made even better with the basket of endless fries.  The last time I was here I opted for the steamed broccoli as my side instead of the burger. The burgers came out and I took one look at the broccoli, said, 'what was i thinking?"" and then immediately started to steal my friends fries.  Don't be me.  If you're eating at Red Robin your diet for that day is dashed.  Commit to sin, and enjoy yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

Fish is the only meat that I eat and there are now no healthy options when I don't want a burger, like most restaurants all of their salads have meat on them and the only fish they offer is fried. That being said, Red Robin's birthday burger is one of the best birthday deals that I have found. I do love that I can replace any burger with a Gardenburger.

47,Kayla H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,8,11.0,5.0,2013-10-04,"I absolutely love this place. I've gone here after going horseback riding at Rolling Hills Ranch with a group of my friends. We always go here after riding because we go riding with empty bellies and KNOW we'll be full by the time we leave here. We get seated quickly and waiting wouldn't be a problem with the multiple televisions they have, including the one on the floor! The ambiance and decoration in this restaurant makes you feel like your at home and can see the history and originality of the place. I've tried three burgers, the Whiskey BBQ Burger, the Bacon Burger, and the Cheeseburger. I have ALWAYS had a little pink inside and they had an absolutely incredible taste! The bottomless fries are great, especially with their special seasoning mix right there on the table. I think their new metal container for them is very clever. The waitresses or waiters that we've gotten are usually very nice and friendly, and give us a great attitude and are patient when we are ordering. Though it does take some time for the food to come out, we always get drinks within a short period of time which gives us awhile for some light conversation around the table. I don't mind the food wait, I actually enjoy it. It gives you and your company more time to converse and find creative things to do while waiting. Lovely place to be, absolutely incredible food and great service. Will gladly come back, any day, any time, no matter how busy.

I usually get a veggie burger, knowing their more than likely Morningstar Farms brand and that's my gripe. Red Robin prides themselves on their burgers, toppings, cheeses, and buns. Why not take some of those gourmet burger chefs at corporate and come up with a flavorful meatless burger? I really mind spending 10 bucks on a Morningstar Farms burger that they nuke and toss on a bun.  Three stars for the Speckled Lemonade.

My recent trip was on Sunday July 12 at 2100 My wife and I walked in and were seated right away, at a booth in the bar area. Our waitress, Jessica, was prompt with our drink orders and her overall service was fantastic. My go to meal is the Tavern Double with a chocolate milkshake. The burger was warm and juicy and the fries were fresh from the fryer and salted to perfection. I decided to try the Thai Chili sauce with my fries. To me the taste resembles the Thai 'R' Cracker from Quaker Steak, if you like Thai 'R' Cracker give the Thai Chili sauce at Red Robin a try. To finish the meal we ordered the Chocolate Fruffles. These are like eating a fudgy chocolate brownie in stick form. The sea salt dusted on the outside enhances the chocolate taste. I preferred the strawberry jam dipping sauce but my wife preferred the chocolate and we each had the whipped cream as our second favorite, but they are all good.

When it came time to pay, the waitress seemed bothered that we didn't know how to use the 'table monster' and even more annoyed when 2 of us wanted to pay with cash.  This is how they get tipped, correct?  On SERVICE, correct?  I've had better service at York Chinese Buffet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

Now, I would estimate there were about 20 or so people crammed at the entrance. We went to the bar area and it was half empty . And no kids (sorry for those with kids, but if you want quick service as a group of adults, head to the bar area). The service was pretty good. The bartender got us our beers quickly (not a large selection, but as my husband says you don't go to Red Robin to get wasted... And if you do jump off a cliff). My food was like any other food at the chain. Old reliable. I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger with no mayo and spicy ketchup. It was delicious.  I'm not sure what my husband ordered but his burger came overlooked but he ate it anyway because we didn't want to wait. His plate was all kinds of chopped up.

The worst thing she did besides not checking on us regularly (with the refills) was when she brought our 3 baskets of bottomless fries, she had them stacked on top of each other and sat them on the edge of the table still stacked, and walked away. Most servers would have at least distributed them. She didn't want to be bothered I guess. The burgers were a for sure 4 stars but the service was a 0.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
5,Dan K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,4.0,2016-12-19,"Who would think I'd get fantastic Fish & Chips at a burger joint??!!! But, I did! I took a chance since I wasn't in the mood for a burger like the rest of my party--and I'm glad I did! Delicious, crisp, perfectly fried coating and thick, white fish pieces--no ""fishy taste"" whatsoever! Very fresh tasting! I'm impressed! This will be my choice from now on! Everyone was satisfied with their burgers and grilled chicken salad as well! The fries were lukewarm and limp--but that fish made them tolerable! Our waitress was very courteous and efficient--very nice girl! Now, the reason I didn't give five stars? The ""hostess WITHOUT the mostess ""! Terrible personality, not friendly and welcoming as a hostess SHOULD be! We almost turned around and walked out. I tried being friendly and she just glared at us. You know her, the miserable one with the strawberry blond hair. Yeah, you need to lose her or lose customers. Other that her, great experience and great food. Apps are very overpriced, but we'll be back for the fish and burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
24,Amanda S.,"Carnegie, PA",16,31,24.0,1.0,2017-01-13,"After leaving my last review and being contacted by Red Robin's customer service (and when I did respond it took them almost two weeks to get back to me), they asked if I still had my receipt. I don't keep burger receipts for two weeks. Then they sent another email thanking me for my input and nothing else. Not even a 10% off coupon for my next dinner or anything to entice me to come back. Massive customer service fail all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
27,Chris B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",27,2,,1.0,2017-01-28,Went to Red Robin i Robinson on a Saturday after a movie. 5 waiters!waitresses walked by our table but no one waited on us or even said that they would be with us. A table of 6 sat down across from us and was waited on immediately. We left and went the the Central Diner. We were acknowledged immediately and given water. We had our food in under 10 minutes.  We had excellent fast service and excellent food.  See my money is good at other places Red Robin.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Steph S.,"Pottstown, PA",0,2,,2.0,2017-02-25,"If you're into exceedingly slow service, eating your salad that was made with lettuce from last year without utensils, and communicating in a special code where apparently the word ""sprite"" means ""water"", then this is the place for you. But in all honesty, this is just an understaffed chain restaurant. To the people sitting in the booth behind us who were acting like Red Robin might lose one of their Michelin stars because of your screaming complaints: relax. They're doing their best with what they have. You're coming to a Red Robin near the city at 10 o'clock on a Friday night. You get what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

30,Lydia K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,22,19.0,2.0,2017-08-16,I have to say this food chain has really gone down hill.  Burgers are tiny but they charge a premium.  Mine tasted like a McDonalds burger.  Honestly you could get a better bigger burger at the local bar establishment for half the price.  My food was served cold.  Sweet potato fries were terrible compared to other places I've had them.  I really have nothing good to say.  If you are over 18 you should pick a different place to go to dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
22,Katelyn G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,13,,5.0,2017-09-29,"Service was so amazing. We came for my Pap's birthday and the servers happily pushed tables together just so he was comfortable and had room (he has trouble walking). Meals were excellent and came at a timely manor. Our server was amazing, refills, sides, sauces she had immediately. I wish I got her name to mention here! Absolutely awesome evening with family!

21,Katie R.,"McKees Rocks, PA",44,37,60.0,1.0,2017-11-03,"Very disappointed. If you plan on coming here expect for something to be incorrect and slow service. Save your time and money and go somewhere else. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It arrived after waiting for 30 minutes and it was black and hard as a rock. Completely burnt and inedible. They remade the burger. I waited another 15-20 minutes and it arrived not burnt this time but without bacon. My husband asked for water twice before we got it. We asked for more sweet potato fries and received regular fries. Lastly, no adjustment was made to my check or even a visit from the manager. I used to be a restaurant manager and in this case I would have visited the table and removed the price of the burger from the check.

20,Connie L.,"Germantown, MD",132,237,668.0,3.0,2017-11-29,"I stopped by for dinner with a colleague on a Wednesday night while working in the area. We arrived before 6 pm and the place wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately at a small booth. Both the hostess and our server, Ashlee, were really friendly. Ashlee was also efficient, getting our orders down and our food out quickly.  I'd been to other Red Robin locations before so there weren't many surprises; the food was tasty but nothing too remarkable. There is a wide variety of burgers, and a small number of options if you want to reduce your caloric intake or want a non-burger entrée. I was able to get pineapple slices on my cheeseburger for just $0.49 extra, which was nice. My coworker got the BLTA croissant with aioli dip for $0.75 extra. If you have a big appetite, the bottomless fries are a bonus. Our total bill came out to be just over $28 after tax and 20% tip (no desserts or drinks). We were able to pay using the pin pad at the table. I had the receipt emailed and it took several minutes to come through, but I did get it eventually. The restaurant was pretty clean and there was a family restroom in addition to men's and ladies' rooms. There was plenty of seating. Overall, a decent place to get a tasty, if average, meal. There was abundant parking in the shopping center in which the restaurant is located.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
