14,Chris H.,"Hamilton, OH",41,212,134.0,1.0,2013-03-03,"We gave up on Applebees a long time ago when it comes to grabbing dinner or lunch. Their food has always been mediocre at best.  Their only saving grace has been their happy hour 1/2 price appetizers from 9 to close. On occasion when we didn't feel like cooking and our typical go to spots are nearing closing time, we've stopped into Applebees to take advantage of said 1/2 price happy hour apps.  Last night was one of those nights. Last minute we decide to drop in ~9:15 and the place is nearly empty - strange as Applebees has always been fairly busy late night. We are promptly seated and our server comes around. She seems rather indifferent to actually providing service, but I can't say I would be too thrilled on a slow Saturday night either, we accept this as the trade off for the happy hour specials.  We order hot wings, spinach and artichoke dip and the classic clubhouse grill. Our server asks if we would like the apps out first and we say yes, please. So some time goes by and we finally get our appetizers. Of course we don't have plates, or silverware so we have to ask for those. Wings are dry, a bit overcooked - pretty much how they are most of the time. Spinach and artichoke dip is good chips are quite salty - as they always are. Again, when we go here we know the tradeoff is quality for price. BUT the sandwich we wanted to come out after the apps came just a minute or so after we got the apps. So much for spreading things out. Insult to injury (how do you screw up a club sandwich) is that the bread/toast is black (overtoasted) and the fries are dry and really just horrible. Waitress came around to ask us how things were and didn't even acknowledge that it all arrived at once. As mentioned, she was just really indifferent - kinda in an annoying way.  Final punch - and this is why we will never be back to any Applebees is that we got the bill and low and behold the apps were full price. Took a look at the happy hour menu and sure enough Happy hour is only M-F now - maybe it's been that way for a while and we had just never been here on any other day that Friday night, but that's the nail in the coffin. So there it is mediocre food, mediocre service and relatively high prices for what you actually get.   Me thinks not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
11,Beth F.,"Cincinnati, OH",288,474,157.0,5.0,2014-03-02,"I know this is a chain, and different locations can provide different experiences. I honestly have nothing bad to say. Most of the time when I've gone to this location it's been when it's super busy and the wait has never been too long. Our servers have always been pretty good and the food is just what you'd expect from an Applebee's. I actually love going during lunch when they have their unlimited soup and salad, and because of that special I realized that I really like their Oriental Salad. Typically when I go for dinner I wouldn't order a salad, so being able to sample the different soups and salads has given me a staple that I always want to order. It's not a place I'd drive over to the other side of town to go to, but when I'm already over there I'm game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
12,Wendy C.,"Liberty Twp, OH",0,10,3.0,1.0,2014-05-17,"Horrible service.   I live right around the corner and have gone there several times. Constant slow service, slow food, undercooked food and never with apology or comp meals. Forget about carry-out (45mins plus) If a different restaurant, similar in price would open in this area, they'd be out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
10,Kyle H.,"Cincinnati, OH",156,86,293.0,4.0,2014-07-19,"I love their food, I always dine late night for discount appetizers, and wing deals. Their service is very good even late night which is odd for most places. Their food seems to be quality, is always freshly made when ordered. Can't really complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
13,Susan M.,"Oxford, OH",5,9,13.0,2.0,2014-12-27,Had the pepper crusted sirloin with whole grains. Was very disappointed as couldn't even taste the pepper on the steak. Was not well grilled. Veggies were over cooked. Spinach was too sparse in the dish and the grains over cooked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
9,Megan S.,"Hamilton, OH",126,53,47.0,1.0,2015-04-07,"Truth be told, this place is pretty gross and definitely overpriced.  I've been three times in my life - which says something, as I am less than 5 minutes away. No matter how many times they try to revamp it, the food just isn't good.  It's low quality eats and tastes like they just threw it into the microwave and then dumped it onto a platter and served it to you.  If you're on the west side of Hamilton and are looking for a place to grab a bite, I'd go with skyline chili or Texas Roadhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
15,William A.,"Pisgah, OH",0,3,,2.0,2015-05-25,"Worst Applebee's ever been to, got the 2 for 20 deal, wing was dry, salad was not fresh, fries came with my burger was dry and cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
7,J C.,,0,12,,1.0,2015-08-18,"Service was sloooow.  When we walked in we saw several people sitting around and not eating.  It took a while to get served. When food was delivered it was done sporadically. Some of us had food and some of us did not.   They were going to bring out a free dessert. After about 20 minutes we finally gave up on waiting for it and asked for our check. Please?  Can we please have the check?  Because that took time as well.  Finally, the computer system had a problem and they could not run our credit card through. So we sat and waited for another 30 minutes.  Server was friendly but that did not make up for the delay.  What could make up for the delay? Food was so so.  Sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
8,Ed B.,"Pisgah, OH",81,25,1.0,1.0,2016-03-19,For a quick meal generally Applebee's is a reasonable choice. Not this store. It is apparent they have NO management. We got here about 5:45 on a Saturday night. There were eleven table that did not have anyone seated at them. There were for groups of two and two or three other groups of varying size. The hostess said that she was NOT allowed to seat people.  At first we the thought maybe they were short on wait staff. Looking around that was not the case. I counted either nine or ten waiters.  Four tables to a waiter is not excess when a third is the tables are two tops There appeared to be a manager but he was never seen doing or managing anything. This place is vey poorly run and needs help. This place show be killing the area as it is the best option for a couple of miles.   I would not recommend this Applebee's and will not be back.  As we were leaving the lobby is still full of people waiting for a table and there are is no one running this restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
6,Hannah W.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,1.0,2016-08-24,"Very miserable experience.  We felt very unwelcomed as soon as we walked through the door. We went to get a drink at the bar and the only bartender working looked at us and ran back to the kitchen. After waiting for five to ten minutes the bartender finally came back and never acknowledged us. The bartender, Courtney, then gave me a drink I never ordered and went outside. The only other group of patrons across from us ordered coffee and noticed something floating in it. The bartender never apologized to them. She threw the coffee in the trash, spilling it all over the can and floor. Upon bringing a new cup, she spilled coffee yet again. The bartender cursed repeatedly and turned off TVs near the bar area that everyone was watching. She never asked how our drinks were, nor did she offer refills. She even said, ""Do you want another beer? Oh, nevermind,"" and then turned away to leave. We were very confused and uncomfortable by what was happening and the way we were treated. If you ever think it's a good idea to go to Applebee's save your money and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
3,Nate B.,"Mason, OH",11,105,187.0,1.0,2017-04-08,"I wouldn't go here. They were out of certain foods and it took them 20 minutes to Dallas. The manager came out and said he sent someone to the other store to get some or waiter game we asked about it she didn't know anything about it. It took over 30 minutes to get The food out and it wasn't bad but I would definitely not go here and wouldn't have here except I was invited. I would go to Chili's if I had to go to somewhere in that area. This is the worst run Applebee's ive ever seen and corporate should step in. In the past I have actually gotten sick eating here so I would question the processes at this store. Please, just stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
5,Lynnea W.,"Hamilton, OH",1,7,,1.0,2017-05-12,"Went for lunch, actually after lunch, about 1:30 pm. Hostess was nice. Waitress was nice but not overly. She just did her job.  The meal was awful. I got a fajita wrap, small salad & fries. The salad was the only thing that was good. The wrap was in no shape or form a fajita. The chicken looked like the kind from a frozen burrito. Brown and in tiny little chunks. All I really tasted was melted cheese. The fries were dry, overdone and over salty. My husband got a chicken & shrimp dinner with potatoes. He didn't eat barely any of it and said, ""I feel like I just paid $30.00 for a dirty mouth."" They had thrown some blob of garlic (?) butter on top of his meal, so they didn't bother to mix it into the meal. Chicken was dry.  Service was so slow.   Find another chain restaurant, this one is disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
4,Josh S.,"Mason, OH",1,6,2.0,1.0,2017-09-15,"Their slogan should be ""applebees for when you don't want to microwave your own food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
1,Luis S.,"Liberty Township, OH",275,83,126.0,4.0,2017-11-30,"I've been coming in for a while now, I normally sit at the bar. The bar tender Michael is really cool, and makes the experience fun. Always does a little flip show, which makes it interesting. If you sit at the bar ask Michael to do the cherry trick. The place always looks pretty clean, and the staff is friendly. Their happy hour menu is good, and they also have $1 PBRs. The wife and I usually come here on Tuesday or Thursday for their all day wing deal. Normally we walk out with a bill of under $20 (not including tip). Haven't sat at a booth in a while, mostly because we like chilling at the bar and watching tv. Not a bad place to stop by for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
0,Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",236,436,1207.0,3.0,2017-12-11,"This Applesbee's location rates right around the middle of all the locations in the area. Nothing too bad to report but nothing exceptional either.  I used to frequent this location a lot when I lived in this area. The staff is always pretty friendly and the food comes out fast and hot for the most part. I've seen this place get really crowded in the past, but for this last visit on an early Saturday afternoon..it was busy but not crazy and we were able to get seated right away. I ordered the triple bacon burger and a side of fries. I usually order the beer cheese and pretzels as an appetizer but I wasn't really overly hungry this last time so I just stuck with the burger. The burger was good overall. With a name like ""triple bacon burger"" you'd expect a ton of bacon, but there never really is. Now, this version of the burger had more bacon than other lesser locations I've ordered it from in the past (cough-cough-Union Center-cough)..but it still wasn't that much bacon. Oh well. The bacon, bbq sauce, and whatever the other sauce they put on it (some type of white sauce) make for an overall pretty tasty burger. I love the fries at Applebee's too..they're sooo overly salted but I love it. Our waitress kind of disappeared after we got our food. We seriously didn't see her again. Luckily they had one of those self check-out tablets at our table so we weren't forced to wait or ask around..it still was kinda strange.  Oh well..not a terrible location but not one of my favorites either. I'd go back if I was in the area and craving some Applebee's food tho for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-4,,,,,
2,Bambi R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,6,,5.0,2017-12-23,I got the appetizers and they were so good! the atmosphere was a lot nicer than other Applebee's i have been to.
