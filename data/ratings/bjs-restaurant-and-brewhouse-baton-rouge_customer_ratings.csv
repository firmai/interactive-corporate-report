149,Eli W.,"Covington, LA",12,37,,2.0,2012-01-21,"I stopped in here for lunch yesterday. I never knew the place existed. Now I know why. The service was horrible from the start. Trying to give my order, the waiter kept looking around at other tables and people coming in. He was more concerned with what was going on around us than us! The menu is quite overwhelming. It had pages of food to choose from, nothing which sounded good to me. Everything either has their ""special sauce"" or avocados. I'm always skeptical of ""special sauce."" I went with a burger thinking that it can't be hard to screw it up. The menu states that all burgers are prepared medium well. Mine was flat out burnt. The bun was even burnt. The other person in my party ordered fish tacos. They sounded very good, but when they arrived the fish was fried! Who's ever heard of a fried fish taco? I wasn't at all impressed with this place and never plan on returning. On the bright side, it wasn't very expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=140,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

We had four people in our group and only 3 dishes were brought out. We didn't see our waiter until 15 minutes later to ask for the dish. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for them to bring it out. They knew they were giving horrible service so they offered to take the late dish off the ticket. That's the only nice gesture made all night. I will say that once the food came out ,I did enjoy it...but the service made the meal miserable.

118,David P.,"Ponchatoula, LA",11,41,1.0,3.0,2012-02-26,"The beer was pretty good but the food wasn't anything special.  The appetizer was pretty bland and both entrees my wife and I had weren't all that great either. In fact, I felt the menu to be overwhelming for a chain.  There's no signature dish, nothing that stood out in the menu. My only complaint about the beer is that the glasses you're served with for their craft brews are said to be pints but I'd say they're closer to 14 oz.  The beers are quite expensive, going about 5-6 bucks a ""pint"".  I don't care if its craft brew, those are strip club prices. Basically BJ's is a brewpub with a restaraunt and mediocre food at best. Service was decent.  Probably a good place to hang out with friends for a few drinks but its not a place I'd make my way to go out to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=100,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

101,Evan B.,"Seattle, WA",19,20,1.0,1.0,2012-06-13,"Ah, BJs. We meet again. After visiting this restaurant twice in 2009 and finding the place to be lackluster, I decided to give it another try yesterday with my girlfriend.  I beat my girlfriend to the restaurant, so I take a seat at the bar while I waited for her. I ask what the happy hour specials are- they weren't especially impressive. I decided not to order a ridiculously priced $6.00 pint of beer and had water instead.  My girlfriend arrives, we are seated. Our server, Veronica, meekly greets us. She was timid and made us both a bit uncomfortable. After she fetched our water my girlfriend asked what a gin and tonic would cost. ""Umm, I'm not really sure, let me go check"" she replied.. A few minutes later she came back with an estimate. We order the cocktail and begin looking over the menus. What colossal menus BJs has! There are pages and pages of different appetizers, entrees, sandwiches, steaks, seafood, etc. Veronica checks to see if we've made a decision on what to eat. I ask a question about the pizza special for the day and, again, she must go off and find out from someone else. She comes back with a pseudo-answer that doesn't much help me, and not wanting to risk pressing her on the question and making her walk across the place again for clarification, I drop it.  I order the 8 ounce house sirloin, my girlfriend gets the lettuce wrap appetizer with cheese and broccoli soup. The broccoli in her soup was mushy and the soup was disappointing. My salad was good enough.  Our entrees come. My steak is cooked as I asked and is about as good as one can expect a sirloin to be. The baked potato is large and came with everything you'd expect. It was good. The lettuce wraps were also quite good.  I remembered from my previous BJs experiences that the ""pizookie"" was the saving grace of the restaurant. It is a hot chocolate chip cookie served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that really is just fantastic. I was really looking forward to ordering this. As I'm finishing up my meal Veronica asks if we'd like dessert. I wasn't done with my potato, so I said for now I'd just like more butter and sour cream. She obliges. Once I've finished my potato she brings the checks without asking if we want dessert. Realizing its taken an act of congress for us to get Veronica to do anything efficiently, I decide to not ask for dessert. Veronica picks up our bills a few minutes after dropping them off to us, but we hadn't paid yet. She nervously brought them back to us and apologized. We paid and were on our way, disappointed with the experience as a whole.  BJ's is an overpriced restaurant with too large of a menu. No wonder poor Veronica had no idea what was going on- that menu would take a great deal of time and effort to fully understand. For the product and service we received, I would much rather have gone somewhere else. The food was...pretty good. The service was poor. The prices are high- for what they charge the food (and service) should be excellent. But hey, if you have the money to blow and don't mind sub-standard restaurants, stop on by! If you appreciate value and good service, go somewhere- anywhere- else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=100,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
110,Nick X.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,11,5.0,4.0,2012-06-13,"Nice selection of food and great selection of beer. My first trip to BJ's was on a gift card from a relative, I had never heard of the place.  I went not knowing what to expect.  I decided to try the pizza, since it was in their name.  I ordered their signature pizza, which is a deep dish ""supreme"" type pizza. I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but I've had worse.  The toppings are corse cut, which I found odd.  Large chunks of tomato, onions, etc.  I had vowed to not return because I wasn't impressed. My second trip occurred the following year when I again received another gift card.  I figured I could go this time and try the microbrews at least.  I went in and ordered the Roast Beef sandwich w/ gravy (french dip anywhere else) - this sandwich was AMAZING.  I think there was some grilled onions in there, I don't know, but it was simply the best french dip I had ever had, my previous favorite was Brew Bachers.  My companion had the chili cheeseburger.  The name is a little misleading, you won't be eating this ""burger"" with your hands.  It is served open face and drenched in chili sauce (I believe this was disclosed in the menu).  The burger is massive.  My companion ate roughly half at took home the rest.  I did not personally try it but I was told it was very good. Both times I went was for lunch on a weekend.  The atmosphere was relatively quiet with people of all walks of life coming and going, generally cheerful and relaxed in an environment similar to J. Alexander's, trendy and modern yet a step above typical casual. I tried several of the beer available.  There is an ample selection to choose from for anyone looking for a different taste from the typical domestic pilsner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=100,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

126,Jack X.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,103,,2.0,2012-06-28,"I don't get the appeal of BJ's.  My guess is that it is located outside the Mall of Louisiana and the Rave theater and one of the closest places from I-10, and the interior has a ""classy motif.""  Overall, though, the food is very mediocre and also overpriced. I visited BJ's a few times.  On my last visit, I had a waiter who opted to socialize with a table of female customers instead of dealing with the table I was at with mostly male customers.  He also made numerous mistakes with our order and was very slow to deliver. Sadly, there are many who castigate Baton Rouge for having bad culinary choices, and BJ's seems to perpetuate that stereotype.  There are far better places in the Mall of Louisiana vicinity--you just have to drive a bit on Bluebonnet to find them, although the restaurants on the Bluebonnet side of the mall are pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=120,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

So I changed my order to the chicken fried steak which I did not really want but couldn't think of anything else that suited my tastebuds.  That's why I had chosen the Pulled Pork Sandwich, it would've hit the spot.  When we got our meal home to eat, I noticed my chicken fried steak was overcooked and almost burnt.  It tasted as such as well.  The only good thing was the mashed potatoes.  The food was barely lukewarm, and it wasn't really a cold night and we don't live that far away.  It's sad BJ's is wasting away slowly but I predict this restaurant will close eventually.  Just not enough good employees to keep it running and not enough good chefs to execute the wonderful menu items, and not good enough management to make sure everyone is doing their jobs AND management who makes sure the kitchen is well stocked with food for orders.  Very poor, I predict a close.  People will keep eating here due to the good menu, but will leave disappointed because patrons are constantly being told the kitchen is out of something or other and the wait staff is SLOW as Christmas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=140,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.18,2.2

One of my favorite appetizers is the thai lettuce wraps.  They are very light and can be a meal for a single person.  They are worth trying.

And the review isn't going to help them change or make the restaurant better.  Anyway- down to business.... I visited this BJ's multiple times- lunch, dinner, late night drinks. Each time was different. I've previously had a terrible experience at a BJ's in another state, so my expectations were pretty low to begin.  First time, was awesome! The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, clear with the specials, and even recommended a few dishes. My fiance even asked to speak with the manager to tell him how great the server did!! (it takes alot to impress the fiance with the food industry!) So we returned... This time for dinner and late night drinks.. This time was mediocre. The waitress wasnt ANYTHING like the first waiter we had. She was pushy- wanted us to get food, but we wanted to sit and drink a little. She had her friends come in at the bar, and it was a large party. She wanted to take care of them which is understandable, but remember.. there are still other tables!! She completely forgot about us when her friends walked in. The table to loud, obnoxious, crowded! So we had to track her down once we were ready to order food.  After we had eaten, my fiance got SICK later that night!! He ordered some chicken dish with mashed potatoes and ate some of my pasta also!!!!  Third time, a friend invited us out and with the last experiences we thought maybe we'll get another good one. Well the waitstaff was again struggling to keep up with his tables. He didnt check up on us often and we normally had to yell at him from across the room so we can ask him questions. The fiance's burger was BURNT TO A CRISP!!! WORST Burger ever!!!!!!! It was like a crispy patty that sat too long under the heat lamps. I think I got a chicken dish and I wasnt all that impressed with it.   With this BJ's its hit or miss.... My expectations are still low.

We didn't complain about the taste of the food.  We told him the issues and didn't know why he was brought out.  Now here's the kicker, her meal was comped at 9.50 i think and then a second Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo was added at 12.50 and comped, but my entree was still there.  The kitchen manager did offer to remake but at that point, we couldn't.  There was another table next to us whose waiter my girlfriend knew, he seemed great.  Couple of guys sat on the other side of the wall from us, sat after us, got their food and finished before us.  And the bad thing is our waitress wasn't that busy.  She only has 2-3 tables including us.   Oh, even better, when the girlfriend arrived she asked to be seated in the bar area.  She was ignored.  A different girl brought her to the booth, and she asked again to sit in the bar, the girl made eye contact with her and sat her in that booth....

We ordered the original crust which is pretty much like thin crust, it didn't seem cooked long enough and the crust was soft instead of crunchy like it was last time(which i liked). We also got the chocolate chip pizzookie which was amazing and boneless wings which were equally good. The only down fall is the hideous lamps right next to your table that has an inch of dust on it.

I have been an avid fan of their deep dish pizza for over TEN YEARS. My pizza today looked like all the cheese had oozed out from the center of the crust and slid down the sides. It tasted awful.

Usually to catch a game, or for a late night outing. Service has REMAINED STELLAR and dare I say it, food has also improved. In fact, they have a salad that I have absolutely fallen in love with.

Once she gets our stuff, she throws things down and walks away in stride, same thing for picking up dishes. She's not personable at all and runs away once you get done talking.

Surprisingly the sides were better than the entrees! Fries were crisp and delicious. Clam chowder was flavorful and hot.

I ordered a Signature Deep Dish Pizza and what I got was a cheap imitation of a deep dish pizza that had no sauce. Well let me rephrase, I think they substitute grease for pizza sauce.  On top of that, the pizza was not true deep dish...It was only about be an inch thick and the crust was way to airy to be true deep dish...Please do not be fooled by the delicious looking pictures of real deep dish pizza on their website. You will not receive that if you order. I don't mind paying for good food, but please heed my warnings, before you order this, take your 25 dollars, crumple it up and throw it in the toilet. Then take another 25 dollars find you're other favorite pizza joint and order.  You will get the same experience (i.e. throwing away good money) without the inconvenience of going to the s*$t hole.

He introduced himself quickly after noticing us and suggested popular drinks and entrees. We informed him that we were on a time limit because we were going to the movies after and that didn't really seem to matter I guess. I am a server and I understand but this was all just unforgivable. We ordered two items and 2 different servers brought out the wrong items, two different times. It took 35 minutes to get everything right. Our server was extremely apologetic and comped off my friend's beer as well as offered us free dessert, but we passed. Will not return most likely. We tipped him 20% because it didn't seem to be his fault, and he tried hard and was super nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=100,3.24,2.95,2.95,2.5960000000000005,3.0660000000000007

96,Sarah B.,"Covington, LA",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-01,"My friends and I have always loved going to BJ's. It has a super laid back atmosphere with a huge menu so everyone can find something they like. However, last night (Saturday, April 30th) was a much different experience than normal. When our group of six arrived at 7:30pm we were greeted with who was perhaps the rudest hostess I have ever encountered. Not only was she very snappy, but she ignored all of our attempts to get her attention after we waited fifteen minutes over our estimated wait time and all other parties who arrived AFTER us had been seated. When she finally did seat us, she all but threw our menus and silverware settings onto the small, square table better suited for four people and stormed off. There were two large, uncleaned booths right next to our table so my friend walked over to the hostess stand to ask her if one of the booths could be cleaned and we could move. The hostess told us we could move to whichever table was cleaned first. Over the next five or so minutes we watched her (seemingly deliberately) clean every other table in our vicinity except for the two that would actually fit our party. When our waitress came by, we mentioned to her that the hostess told us we could move to either of the two tables and she informed us that one of the two tables was bigger than the other. When she attempted to find someone to clean that particular table, the hostess stormed over and actually raised her voice, nearly shouting, at our group and our waitress claiming that we were LYING and she never told us we could move to the larger table. Luckily, while this was happening the other table was being cleaned so we decided rather than cause a scene and possibly get our waitress in trouble, we would move to that table even though it wasn't quite suited for the size of our group. Once we were at the new table we made sure to apologize profusely to our waitress because it was absolutely not her fault. I've never written a Yelp review before, but this hostess' seemingly unwarranted behavior towards customers and a coworker in the middle of a busy restaurant was completely unacceptable and quite jarring in my opinion. I wish I had gotten her name, but that was the last thing on my mind during the commotion. I want to be clear, the one star is not for our waitress or the food (we still love BJ's), but I do not believe the hostess' behavior should be ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=60,3.08,2.76,2.76,2.6280000000000006,2.8880000000000003

A few minutes later he sat 2 young ladies.  I expected the server to stop by soon so I decided what i wanted to drink and eat.  I searched for hotels in Shreveport LA and booked a room; and then I noticed the two ladies had drinks and no menus.  I asked if they ordered and they said yes. I checked... 15 -17 minutes had flown by and not one of the three servers who walked by offered me a glass of water, let alone acknowledge I was there.  So I asked for the manager. Gary, a nice enough guy but, I was so angry I didn't need him to appease me.  I left fully engulfed in anger and frustration.  Then I heard some one call, I took a deep breath, and I turned.   Thank you Roger (executive chef) for taking the extra minute to calm me down and remind me that I just needed to eat- and have a beer.

The service started with a confused waitress not knowing if we were greeted already or not so that was a bit embarrassing. After 3 minutes our waitress arrives to get our drink orders but she was not aware of the beer sampler details which made me opt out of it. I ended up getting a pint of Stella and Alabama sunset. The new Alabama sunset was a great cocktail with a nice pineapple orange juice flavor and a slight hint of alcohol present.  The calamari- very delicious! Lightly breaded with jalapeños fried bits which was very complimentary.  Jalapeño burger- delicious tasting burger with a bit of spice. Could have used a tad bit more salt and some kind of a sauce to the burger but still delicious on that amazing bun. The skinny fried complimented it amazingly.  The ahi tuna salad- amazing salad with a nice blend of flavored with the daikon, salad, fish, and sauce. A great choice for a nice and healthy entree.  However during our dining we were interrupted several times with confused servers bringing another tables food to our table. They might need to step up their memorization on their table charts a bit better.  Our server Elizabeth tonight did a great job tonight.

Tonight was our third visit to this location.  Our first two visits (a slow summer afternoon and a recent Friday night) we're fine; good service and decent food at a price we expected. Tonight was different.  Tonight was a miss. We arrived at 6:30 ton full restaurant.  The hostess took our phone number and told us the wait was 10-15 minutes.  We had hoped to grab a few happy hour drinks anyway, so we checked the bar area for a bar table/space.  There were 4 ""open"" tables that were piled with dirty dishes.  We decided to wait for one of those and took our seat when the first one was cleaned 20 MINUTES LATER (6:50 - still happy hour).  Someone came to take our drink 15 later and our drinks came 15 minutes after that.  If you're following along at home, you'll notice that we had been at the brewhouse for 50 minutes before w received our first drink.   The server took our food order when our drinks arrived.  We did not see him again until the food came out.  The food (a pizza and a dinner salad) was fine.  We ordered a second round of drinks upon the arrival of the food and those did not come until we had almost finished eating.   And then the wait for the check...    zzz...   zzz...   zzz... Check arrived.  Happy Hour discount for one of the first drinks ($1.50 off a beer - thank you) but did not do it for the other drink (1/2 off wine - WTF?).  We left feeling ripped off.

My favorites are the peach berry tea, calamari, parmesean crusted chicken and the California club Flatbread. This specific location was ok. The hostess were extremely welcoming but the service was slow and just ok. Waited 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server and than food took another entire hour before it came to our table. That's disappointing. Other than that food was delicious as always",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge,3.24,2.93,2.93,2.7960000000000003,3.0540000000000003
40,Katie S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,12,1.0,4.0,2017-01-14,"BJs is a nice place to go for a place to meet with friends to sit back, share some appetizers, and watch a sporting event. At least to me, not too many crazy sports fan screaming, a relaxed way to enjoy. The menu is large, and anyone can find anything on it. I used to love to get the fried artichokes in lemon aioli. It was a small bites dish, so wish there was more. I sometimes shared their chili nachos with others, decent version. I'd prefer typical nacho ingredients to go on it, not just chili like we had. Going there many times though I've had many different types of service. Some amazing and some lack luster. I understand that comes with going to any restaurant though. I gave BJs a 4 out of 5 though because everything I had was good, but not necessarily something I feel the need to get again and again.

My personal favorites are the BJ's favorite pizza and the slider appetizers. Also, the shrimp lettuce wraps are also very good. They have a good variety of beers so you will surely find something you enjoy Cons: service is slow during happy hour. The wait staff is nice, but it does take a while to get your food. So if you are getting close to end of happy hour, may be best to just put in a bunch of orders and prepare to wait So if you want something good to eat and don't mind a wait at times, great option",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge,3.36,2.98,2.98,,3.132

Our frustrated waiter apologized and went back to get them. We ordered a cocktail from the bar..... it took about 30 minutes to get it. The waiter kept going back asking for it and the bartender kept shoeing him away, and telling him we would have to wait ( we witnessed this from our table). The manager was called to the table, he was very apologetic and offered to comp the meal, but we declined and only accepted a comp for the drink. Our food was ok, nothing to be wowed by.

My little ones had the personal pan pizza and it was delicious as well. It's similar to Pizza Hut but better. On this visit our waitress, Natasha was super nice!! We had three little girls with us and she made them feel very special. I don't know if it was a Black Friday special or not but she brought out a complimentary appetizer to the kids. It was a garlic buttered croissant and a small cup of grapes and blackberries.
