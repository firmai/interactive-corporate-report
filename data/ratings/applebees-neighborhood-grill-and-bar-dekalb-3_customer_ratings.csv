4,Matthew K.,"DeKalb, IL",2,50,,2.0,2012-04-02,"Applebee's pretty much wrote the book on mediocre food, and the DeKalb location is a model for this mediocrity. You come to Applebee's because you want to get waited on, but you don't want to spend the money to go to a real restaurant.  When you discover the quality of the food in proportion to how much you spent, you realize you've been ripped off. In addition, the DeKalb location has serious service issues.  The last five times I've been there, there have been major issues with the service: orders forgetting to be placed, drink orders not delivered but still charged for, neglecting the table, chatting and joking with friends; the list goes on. The only possible reason to go to Applebee's is to watch sports at the bar, have a few drinks, and eat some pub grub.  It has a nicer atmosphere for this than, say, Buffalo Wild Wings where it is simply to loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dekalb-3?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
7,Jeanna G.,"Neenah, WI",21,21,1.0,2.0,2012-06-25,"My husband and I have been here a few times since the beginning of 2012.  The food has been alright, and actually the fajitas are better than ever... but my complaint is directed more towards the service and the attitude of the staff. Our server (Mike, I think?) was okay, but he spoke way, WAY too fast for me to even understand him. I had to ask him to repeat himself several times. It was very hard to understand anything he was saying. We came to this location in the early dinner hours last Saturday night, and our order took well over 30-45 minutes to get to our table. It wasn't busy. I really didn't see the reason for the delay. While we waited, I noticed a couple sitting behind my husband complaining about their food.  One person ordered the fajitas and even took it back, because ""it was too spicy"".  So when I saw others having problems with their order (same server), that was a red flag. Also, I should add that I saw this same couple on our way home, and at a stop light, the lady actually got out of the car, and gave the driver behind them their food they didn't eat, from here! But anyway, I digress. Our food was okay. We both got burgers.  While we were eating, I noticed one of the hosts complaining, quite loudly. He complained about how bored and tired he was, and just wanted to go home.  He looked like he could care less about seating people.  (I believe attitude is everything, and if you're the first person a customer sees, show that you actually care, or at least fake it until you make it... don't complain within earshot. ) So, with  the extremely long wait and the weird vibe I got from our server (and his inability to speak slowly/clearly for customers to understand), I don't think we'll be coming back to this Applebee's. My husband even got sick after eating the bacon cheeseburger. If we want to go out to eat at a sit-down place we'll make the drive to Geneva or Lombard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dekalb-3?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

36,Norah C.,"West Chicago, IL",1,3,,1.0,2014-06-02,"I would give this zero stars if I could. The waitress didn't give us the time of day and when we did catch her, she was not friendly at all. She never cleared our dirty plates from our table even when it was to the point that we were stacking our empty plates and shoving them toward the edge so she would take them. Looking at nearby tables, the same thing was happening in our whole section. I ordered a margarita and I'm positive they didn't put any alcohol in it. It tasted like I was drinking kool aid with extra sugar. I did not get carded twice by people with bad attitudes just so I could not get a shot of tequila in my margarita. The worst part was the food. My boyfriend and I got the 2 for $20 deal. The spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer was watery and may or may not have actually contained artichokes. That would have been no big deal but the next part really threw the whole meal off. I ordered the steak. It came out grey. I cut into it and it was strangely undercooked on the inside while too chewy on the outside. The meat itself didn't look at all like steak. Imagine a meat the texture of tuna, the color of a street, which tastes like a block of salt. This is what I was served. I was concerned that the piece of meat had perhaps gone bad and finally complained to the waitress about it. She took my plate and said they would fix it. (Later we theorized that it had actually been ground beef- or maybe a mixture of ground meats- that got formed into a steak-like shape and thrown onto a George Foreman grill.) I don't send back food often but the few times I have in the past, the restaurant has completely replaced it. Not last night. They took my same ""steak"" and reheated it. I honestly think they put the whole plate in the microwave because it was super hot and the mashed potatoes that had almost cooled to an edible temperature were now back up to molten lava. The manager brought my plate back without saying anything except to ask me to cut into it. He didn't apologize for the mishap. He didn't offer to comp anything. He didn't even smile, ask if we needed refills of water (we did), or really do anything a person concerned with customer service would do.  In the midst of this, my friend used the restroom. When she returned, she said the floor was so sticky it started pulling off her shoes from her feet. When we got the bill, it somehow ended up more expensive than it should have been. We paid the bill as quickly as we could and got out of there. I felt queasy all night and as I am writing this I have a stomach ache, no doubt from the mystery meat I ate (not even half of) last night. Honestly, they need a new staff, some testing done on their meat, and a visit from the health inspector.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dekalb-3,,,,,

29,Marcus G.,"Dallas, TX",127,7,,1.0,2017-02-11,"DO NOT go here if you are Black. I went here with my girlfriend, and we experienced discrimination on two separate occasions. However, I'm going to reflect on the more prominent experience. I went to this Applebee's in DeKalb, IL on a Friday night around 7pm, and they were fairly busy. There was a 15 minute wait to be seated. My girlfriend and I were eventually seated about 3 minutes before the two parties consisting of all White people were seated after us, one was a party of two white people who were seated adjacent to us and the other was a group of three White people who were seated directly behind them. Both of these other parties were greeted by their waiter/waitress almost immediately as we just sat there looking puzzled. The party across from us had the same waiter as us, and the group of three had another. However, they both were acknowledged and received service at least 6 minutes before we did. I got more and more upset as we sat there and waited  to place our order. We watched our waiter, Dalton, pace up and down the aisle at least four times without acknowledging us. It gets worse, I didn't realize that the couple next to us didn't actaully place their order when Dalton initially greeted them. Dalton finally made it over to us about 6 minutes after speaking with them even though we were seated first. We placed our order immediately. Dalton then went over to the couple next to us 2 minutes after taking our order to take theirs. I expected my girlfriend and me  to get our food before both of the other groups not because we were seated first but becasue we had a simple order and the group next to us placed their order after us and the group behind them ordered three dishes. In conclusion, we got our food 12 minutes after both groups. Hence, why he received no tip. I pride myself on being extremely nice to everyone in the restaurants I go to and leaving great tips for great service. So I know it could not have been something I did to warrant such poor service. And to top it all off, the food wasn't even good, and we've had the same dishes before when they were busy and the dishes were good then.

I ordered the French onion soup and honey chicken tenders with fries. I would have been better off going to Hy-Vee and buying them on my own. The soup has so much bread and cheese that it seemed like there was virtually no soup in it - I tried to eat it and it was so congealed and chewy that I ended up having to peel it off with my knife. It had obviously been premade and reheated, which is just...gross, because I believe that if the halved the bread and cheese and made it fresh, it would have been good. The chicken tenders were fatty, covered in this sickly sweet sauce that was difficult to stomach. But one decent thing: their fry game is okay.
