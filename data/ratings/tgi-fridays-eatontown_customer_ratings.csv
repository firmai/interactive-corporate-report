There wasn't anyone at the door when we arrived and had to wait a few minutes before anyone showed up. The waitress was nice and pleasant. However, service was a bit slow. The food was really good though. In the summer, TGI fridays has a Jack Daniels menu. Good choice! It has a bit of a kick to it. The drinks were good and the waitress even brought over an extra drink that was made accidentally at the bar, free of charge.

18,larry c.,"PRINCE, NY",3,9,,1.0,2014-03-26,"I wish that I could give negative stars. Had an enjoyable dinner at TGIF's in the Monmouth Mall. The night went downhill fast upon leaving Friday's. My friend and I are handicapped. My friend uses a scooter and we parked by the blue lines in the handicap parking spot. ( So she has room to get into the van. Since her scooter won't fit otherwise) Now here comes the major problem. Someone decided to park in the blue lines in the handicap section of the parking lot. I looked and the person didn't have a handicap placard in their car. My friend couldn't get into the car. because her scooter couldn't  fit. I went back into the restaurant.  I explained the situation. Then asked if they could find out who was parked in the blue lines. ( Which isn't a parking spot ) The person said they couldn't do that, because they didn't want to disturb their customers. The Manager told me - drive around and look for the mall police. They drive around all the time. ( How am I supposed to drive around. When we are blocked into getting into the van? We both need the lift to get into the van ) I then called mall security. They said they would be over in 5 minutes. They showed up 25 minutes later. Which was horrible, since it was windy and 25 degrees out. A few minutes after mall security showed up, a young man came out. He was the one that parked in the spot. Mall security took. his license plate and name down and we took a bunch of pictures to show his park job.  It's kind of sad that a company like TGIF's treats not just their customers this way. They treat their handicapped customers this way. They didn't want to disturb their patrons who were eating by making an announcement.

I travel for business an I have visited just about every tgi fridays in every single state even over seas, and never have I been to one with as crapy service and lousy cold food like this location. The service was the worst by far, it took about 17 minutes to be greeted, the server was rude and licked his finger as he was taking my order. My pasta had spit in it and was completely cold. I never received my appetizer and my dinner came out before my water. Where do they serve dinner before drinks? After speaking with a manager it seemed as tho that quality of service is tolerated. The manager was not thorough and some what of a rookie that had no idea how to fix the situation.

3,Alyssia R.,"Asbury Park, NJ",22,5,,1.0,2015-03-28,"Went here the other night with one of my friends after an extremely long week of work. All we wanted was to unwind and have some drinks and appetizers and when we got there there was a relatively loud group sitting at the bar.  We sat down and tried to ignore them but they were cursing and being down right obnoxious. It was hard to enjoy the food and have a conversation with my friend.  A few minutes later an even more obnoxious crew walked in. Unfortunately they sat down right next to us and one of them demanded the bar top be wiped down for her very rudely. It was honestly hard to not eavesdrop on them because the things coming out of there mouth was so ridiculously trashy and loud, I was embarrassed for them. Then to top off the uncomfortable events, what seemed to be the manager of the restaurant approached these 3 people telling them to leave immediately and that one of the girls was never allowed back. She got very loud and very disrespectful and told the manager to ""call the cops, I ain't got no fucking warrants"". My jaw just dropped and I was ready to walk out but I was so hungry I just wanted my food. Then she loudly left cursing and screaming on her way out.  After a few moment of them going back and forth she chugged her LIT and left. Then the other people remaining at the bar started to converse about why the girl was kicked out prior to this night. She fought some girl and threw a bar stool at her. I was 100000% done at that point and me and my friend got the check and left.  Needless to say I will not be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown?start=20,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

10,A J.,"Red Bank, NJ",0,30,1.0,1.0,2015-11-07,"Terrible. The worst. Visited twice recently. Will not return. Visit 1:  10/24/15 afternoon.   Ordered a beer for myself and glass of wine for my girlfriend. The beer tasted bad. It was either not the beer I ordered, or the tap needed to be cleaned, or both. Sent it back and got rum punch which was ok. Food was ok. Got the jack Daniels chicken sandwich, which was ok, but the quality of the chicken itself isn't as good as competitors. Good thing I checked the bill. The waiter or bartender did not remove the beer I sent back, and also charged for a more expensive glass of wine than we ordered. Service was adequate but not stellar. Too bad, we tip very well when service is good (as much as 40%). Visit 2:  11/5/15 7:15 p.m.  After this visit we will not return. Was greeted by an unfriendly hostess who frowned upon us for stating we wanted a table ""not near any screaming babies"". She seemed offended that we made this request. News flash: everyone does not have/ want kids or want someone else's kids screaming and running around while trying to enjoy drinks and overpriced (for the quality) food. I figured 7:30 on a school night we might be safe. Nope. A few minutes after being seated, the servers and hostess started prepping an 18-top RIGHT NEXT TO US with about 10 kids. The hostess smirked at us, did not inform us or ask if we wanted to be moved. We had to ask the manager. So we moved. Then we were ignored by our server, who never came over to check on us. We had to hunt him down to get our check and grab our own to-go boxes. We usually tip very well and he would've easily gotten $15 on a $45 check (33%) if he was halfway decent, but instead we left him $4 and he's lucky he even got that. I can't understand people providing such poor service when they are working for tips!!! Chili's is a much better choice when in the Monmouth Mall vicinity. Much better service and the food/drinks are always good. The Olive Garden next door isn't a bad choice either. Never again TGIF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown?start=20,,,,,

I should if known things were going to be bad the moment we walked it and the hostess had such an attitude like we were bothing her. The waitress was nice....when she decided to show up. She took forever for anything. I had ordered a smoothie that didnt come until my food was half done. Speaking of we had to wait a minute to eat cause the waitress didnt bring our forks but when we asked she went into the back and dissapeared.

22,Derek Y.,"New York, NY",90,212,481.0,2.0,2017-03-29,"I feel like chains like TGI Fridays oftentimes get bad raps because they're located in suburban towns where only a handful of people may review, and only when they have exceptionally poor service. Well, while I AM reviewing and giving just two stars, it's not only because I had a horrible time -- I just review everything! I went with three others early on a Sunday afternoon and was seated upstairs. The visit didn't start well: our waitress took a few minutes to come and take our drink orders, and then she disappeared for some time. After what seemed like 15 minutes, she finally returned and took our food orders. She apologized for the delay and noted that there were more customers than anticipated for a Sunday, but that didn't alleviate much because I had to catch a train to NYC afterwards and every minute that ticked by added more stress. By the time our food arrived we had been there for literally 1 hour and 20 minutes. Well, our food finally arrived and I was extraordinarily disappointed. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer ($9.49) and found that it was extremely oily and unappetizing; there wasn't much chicken inside and it tasted like I was simply eating cheese and bread. I actually stopped eating it halfway through, and that's saying something. The others got the buffalo wing burger ($12.99), half rack of ribs ($12.99), and a ribeye steak with a half rack of ribs ($26.98) and said that they enjoyed their meals, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing... Bottom line is that I won't be returning to this location.

First off, the bar was dirty with crumbs from prior meals.  We sat in front of this mess for 15 minutes until eventually the bartender who looked like he cared less came over and said something so low (almost purposely so we cant hear him).   We first asked him to clean the counter, for which he gave a shitty smirk to.  Then it took him another 10 minutes to take our order. I got the Chicken Fransesca full for $15.49.   The portion was tiny and the pasta tasted dried up as if it was sitting for hours in a vat. The bartender the entire night was talking with his friends that were hanging out at the bar, being loud, cursing, etc....     This Fridays brings a terrible crowd, unlike Chillis and Applebees right down the road.   It's almost like a hangout where all the employees friends come and take over the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

31,Melissa S.,"Flemington, NJ",149,71,361.0,2.0,2017-07-31,"I dined at T.G.I. Friday's in Eatontown after the races at Monmouth Park yesterday.  I had never been to this location before, but it was close to have dinner w/ friends after the races, so that was my primary reason for choosing this restaurant.  My friends and I sat the bar.  The bartender was extremely unfriendly and was clearly in a bad mood.  He seemed like he was under a lot of pressure, so I tried to cut him a break.  It took about 10 minutes for him to get my drink order.  My friends and I ordered the endless apps. It took FOREVER for the order refills.  My friend's refill order on the endless apps was something different than what he actually ordered.  Since it was endless apps, he kept it, but never received what he actually ordered. At one point, the bartender was attending to other guests, and he kept telling me ""I can hear you, what do you want to order.""  I told him I wasn't going to yell out my order across the bar.   I was there for about an hour and 15 minutes, and I only had 1 drink.  He walked past my empty glass at least 4 times, and even then I said to him, my drink needs a refill, he still didn't come over and address it.  Finally, my friends and I were so annoyed, that we decided to leave.  We weren't ready to leave, but the service was terrible, and I couldn't deal w/ the attitude from the bartender.  According to my receipt, his name was Jarrette.  Right as we were about to leave, the bartender and another server got into an argument and they both were YELLING at each other in front of customers, as we were about to leave.  My friend actually told them it was unprofessional to yell in front of their customers.  I didn't even bother to have him add my points.  I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. I have no intention of ever going back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
21,David C.,"Eatontown, NJ",8,49,51.0,2.0,2017-08-01,"I give an extra star for this place only because I've never actually had a bad meal here. Any negative feelings I have for this place are due to the incredibly bad service! It all started quite a few years back I admit, but anytime after that, including a recent visit and it has just been plain bad. It has all been at the bar area as well and the only time I've had table service was on Valentine's Day with a date in 89', which actually was very good. The bad started when I had the same meal, served by the same server and I paid with the same denomination, which was a 50 dollar bill.(had approx 25.00 coming back) She gave me my change the first time and I tipped appropriately as I always do. The week later she took my 50.00, walked away with a load of dishes to the kitchen and never returned. Sitting there wondering what was going on, the man who took over asked me if I was waiting for something and I told him what happened. He checked the receipt and register and gave me the correct change and walked away. I was very unhappy about this and most definitely complained. Next visit I had a Jack Daniel's burger and I have to admit I have a tendency to eat pretty fast. I'm not messy, nor do I have bad table manners, just a very quick ""eat and run"" type of guy. The bartender came to take my plate and gave me a very sarcastic remark about how the food must not have been very good and walked off. Final visit was with a friend who lived in my community and really wanted to just get out for a few. we ordered drinks and I asked for a menu. There were only us and one other customer in the afternoon and when I put the menu down the young lady was just interested in talking with my friend and never asked me for a refill on my beer, or if I wanted anything from the menu. Told my friend I would see him back at the house and that was the last and final time I will ever come here. It's a shame because when I first moved into my new place, Fridays is practically in my back yard and only a few minutes walk. Please spend a few extra dollars and go to Houlihan's! They rip this place to pieces and the service makes this place look like a fast food drive through operation. Can't even provide a pic, because all you would see is an empty mug in an empty bar!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

24,Nai A.,"Neptune City, NJ",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-31,"Friday's was once a spot that I loved going to almost every weekend with my family as a child. However over the years the quality of food and service has more than significantly decreased. Over the past year all of my experiences at friday's have been full with subpar food and mediocre service. I came into friday's last night with my boyfriend looking to enjoy a night of 13$ endless appetizers, only to find out the price has been increased (for a second time) to 15$ per person with only 4 not so appetizing appetizers available to choose from. I instead opted for the appetizer sampler which offered a wider range of items for a better price. The food was good, service was just okay. I am very disappointed that my  childhood favorite restaurant has turned into what it is today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
