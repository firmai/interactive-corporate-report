Yolanda M.,"Salinas, CA",22,8,,4.0,4/23/2017,Service was great..waitress was very attentive. .she made sure are cups were filled and napkins replenished.  Food was very good..appetizers came out quick and were nice and hot.  Main courses were good..steak was tender..cooked perfectly medium rare.  Ribs were not as tasty..they tasted steamed then a brush of bbq sauce.  Veggies great... mashed potatoes were decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20

Winona B.,"Orange, CA",36,21,14,3.0,11/22/2016,"My friends and I came in at lunch to see that the place was busy, but we were seated right away. Our server was very patient and kind about my friends and I finding ourselves a little undecided on the menu, which I appreciated. Overall the experience here felt a bit average, though. The highlight was that our server tended to us really well without being overbearing, but the food wasn't terribly special or bad at all. There were also a lot of staff just waiting around and making small chat with each other which was a little unusual to see.  If you're looking for just anywhere to eat with a typical restaurant chain setting and food quality, this place fits the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20

Amy L.,"Monterey, CA",35,42,7,2.0,12/20/2016,"I'm a busy working mom. There aren't many places my kids like and Chilis makes that coveted list. Every single time I try to place an order online, the app says I can't place my order online and to call. Every single time I've called, they've either completely butchered my order or ""couldn't hear"" when I had perfect signal and I heard almost no background noise. So my suggestion might be to buy a phone that works or fix your website. Because I got that MILF money and sometimes mama doesn't wanna cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20

Its always a miss.  9pm - close weekday happy hour for drinks and appetizers. Texas cheese fries and buffalo wings were OK, probably the only thing that isn't ever messed up. My pasta was very dry. Chiken was blah.  My friends steak came out while she had to wait a few minutes for her side?!? What the heck Slowest service I have probably ever received.  We ate our food and once finished we still chatted for about 40 minutes waiting ... While our server was MIA. Went to grab a quick bite with a friend and ended up being the last people here.

Nicole K.,"Oakton, VA",263,115,51,4.0,4/29/2015,"Chain restaurants tend to be the same - lack luster food with average service.  This Chili's (and their new menu) took that expectation and threw it out the window.   I was in Monterey for the Big Sur marathon and this restaurant was conveniently next to my hotel (Embassy Suites) - and while I typically look for a more 'local' place, this was so convenient and I was tired from a long flight.  The wait at Chili's was less than a couple minutes and my friend and I were sat in a booth.   The restaurant was full with runners and the bar was packed.  We ordered two skinny margaritas from the bar and only had to wait a few minutes before we got our drinks.  Let me just say, the skinny margaritas are delicious and do not taste 'lite' at all!  We even asked if they were accidentally made w/ regular mix!    For our dinner we both opted for the fajitas.  I got the steak and shrimp, and my friend got the chicken and shrimp.  The fajitas came w/ 3 tortillas and a slew of toppings on the side (spicy sour cream, jalapeños, salsa, guacamole, cheese) and a huge helping of shrimp, steak, and veggies (onions / peppers).   The shrimp was good and perfectly cooked.  The steak was a tad tough, but had decent flavor.   The price for 2 dinners and 4 drinks was under $70!   Good value and good food for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20
Cathy P.,"Portland, OR",464,382,5,4.0,2/21/2015,"We had some shopping to do in Seaside yesterday and wanted a quick, semi-healthy lunch (like salads) and happened upon Chili's. I've had a few bad experiences with a Chili's at another location and was a little leery of trying it again. Apparently, like Applebee's, they have really revamped their menu and that's a good thing! We opted to sit in the bar since it looked relatively quiet - no kids - and mostly empty. There were lots of TV's turned to various sports venues and our waitress greeted us very quickly, took our drink orders (iced tea) and left us to peruse the extensive menu. There were the usual suspects: appetizers, salads, chili (of course), burgers, wraps, sandwiches, ribs...you get the picture.  Being sometimes fans of Chipotle's rice bowls, the Chili's version caught our attention. I decided on the Margarita Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice, topped with house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a perfect drizzle of margarita sauce. I added chicken to mine and didn't get any tortilla strips but they weren't missed. Not bad at all! My husband ordered the hotter Chipotle Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice & chipotle pesto. His was topped with cheddar cheese, house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a drizzle of cumin-lime sour cream. He also added chicken to his. Both were a little under $10 and just the right amount of food. Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and gave us just the right amount of attention. Also like Applebee's, there is that gadget contraption on the table you can ""play"" with but I mainly ignored it ---- until it was time to pay the bill. Our waitress encouraged us to use the thing, so not wanting to be labeled an old curmudgeon, I swiped my debit card, added the tip (got tricked into taking a survey) and printed out my receipt. It was painless really, but is the future for all restaurants? I hope not. Anyway, Chili's has renewed my respect for the brand. Not that I'll be a regular customer but at least I won't have the negative view of them any longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,239,350,2.0,2/23/2016,"High levels of chlorine in the tap water. You can taste it in the iced tea too. Monterey Peninsula is known for high levels of chlorine in there water and seaside establishments are the worst in my opinion. If you order a soda, alcohol or something not made with water, you will be good.  The food is decent for a chain restaurant; Chilis. I usually have to send it back most of the time because it's cold or not well made.  Just kind of thrown together. The steak has been cold before :|  The Chips and salsa- the chips should always be hot. Always hot. This is not the case most of the time. Like the heater is off in the chip dispenser or something. Friendly staff but just not quite ""on it"" most of the time. We come in and usually wait in the waiting area for about 3 minutes before a hostess arrives despite the bar tenders and other servers looking at us. We are not a priority and they are not very attentive usually.  To avoid disappointment, I order the Buffalo Chicken salad without pico and I add the corn salsa which is a nice addition. It's a very tasty salad and I'm not ever disappointed with it. That's a good safe play.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20
Danielle M.,"Salinas, CA",1,51,21,1.0,7/24/2016,Food is horrible every time.  Service is a hit or miss.  I think the only reason we come back is the Lemonade and the spinach queso and endless chips.  It's nice you can get points to get free things.  Especially since their food isn't good.  I feel the chili's in Salinas does a little better on food quality but really they are the same.  No taste in food and everything has a southern mexican tex mex taste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=20

Naomi J.,"Seaside, CA",63,44,16,5.0,10/26/2017,"I may be biased because I grew up on this restaurant, but Chili's can do no wrong in my book. I love their promotions, from their frequent email discounts to their 2 for $20 back in the day.  Appetizers: I have tried almost every appetizer on the menu and they are all spectacular, except for I wish there were some bread/fried-free options. Their guacamole is almost as good as Chipotle's, and the southwestern egg rolls and Texas cheese fries are unhealthy and outstanding.  Food: Their honey chicken crispers are full of flavor and crunch, their house side salad is superior to most side salads that I have tried, their molten chocolate lava cake is worth melting for, their mango chicken manages to be tender and juicy (and a little too small), and the chicken tortilla soup I just can't get enough of (also incredibly salty, so can't get enough water either). The only thing I have ever tried there that I don't absolutely love is their ribs - could be juicier and more tender. Drinks: Chili's drinks are affordably priced and far more delicious than most places I have been to. If you don't like your drinks to be that strong, I think their margaritas and coolers are refreshing and fun. This restaurant consistently reminds me that I want everything on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside
Kyle C.,"Monterey, CA",108,25,4,1.0,12/11/2017,"It has been a long time since I've felt this kind of disappointment from any restaurant. My girlfriend and I were out on a date night and decide to try Chili's out instead of our usual spot. What a mistake we made. The wait time for a slow night was 10 minutes and as soon as we got seated we decided to order, thinking that we might be here for a while. Our server promptly apologized for the wait and said he would take care of us. After receiving our  appetizer we waited 20 minutes for 2 identical orders of ribeye steak. During the wait another server who was acquaintances with my lady, sat down in our booth and overstayed her welcome. The steaks were served and she kept sitting st our table! How unprofessional can you be? Both steaks were ordered the same but we're cooked completely different. We waited for our server to come back to inquire about it and he was no where to be found for 15 minutes. We decided to try eating them to see if we were just tripping, and we weren't. I decided to eat as much as I could because I was about to pay $20 for it and at this point, felt like nothing we would say is gonna make a difference to this establishment. I haven't felt that uncomfortable in a long time. Don't waste your time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside
Bonsai T.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2017,"Man what a disappointment! I just started working in an office close-by. Phone option for pick up orders #2 kept dropping my call.  Girl at bar was pleasant on phone and took my order. SALAD!...was not ready when I got there.  Sat for what seemed like forever. Notified staff that my lunch break was coming to and end. $22.67 for a coke, Southwestern Chicken Salad and Cauliflower Appetizer plus 12% tip. Got to my car, started eating appetizer....soggy. Got to the stoplight, coke was flat! Opened to peek at the salad, chicken was cold. Got to work, salad was mostly a shallow bed of brown wilted iceberg.  Never seen so much rotten lettuce in a served salad! Absolutely NO avocado as advertised in the picture. Reluctantly ate a chicken strip, cold and rubbery. Got into my second chicken strip, stared down and spotted a fly! If I get ill shortly I will be calling to complain officially. According to the other comments on Yelp, management doesn't much care. It's too bad. I had such high hopes when they first came.  It was good when it first opened!

When I read the menu and decided what I wanted, the waiter told me my government issued ID was not a valid form of identification.

M S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,67,14,1.0,10/28/2014,"Ate here while traveling through Monterey. It was around 9:30 p.m. and just wanted to walk some place. This was one of a few options. Bear in mind, all over the restaurant they now have signs that say ""Fresh"" and the like.  Got the onion rings, a burger with bacon and such, and the healthy choice 6 oz. beef tenderloin.  I only expect food offered by Chili's to be grade D or whatever is the edible rating now as labeled by the FDA. However, their onion rings have to be fully frozen because each onion ring had an onion ""skin"" inside but no real onion. You know, like when you peel an onion and there's that sort of skin that has a bit of a membrane. That's how thick the onion was in every single onion ring and the whole onion ring is actually huge.  The beef in the burger did not taste like a burger. However, the bacon and whatever else was on the burger did taste good.  The broccoli with the tenderloin was good and seemed to just be steamed without butter or oil. I liked that a lot. A big plus while traveling and eating a lot of road food. The small tenderloin was really salty -- must use the salt as the tenderizer because it was extremely tender. I love salt, but I couldn't finish it because it was just too salty so the husband got a few bites too. Is was more or less cooked to the doneness ordered - medium rare.

Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,62,20,3.0,7/25/2013,"First off, let's be honest. It's a Chilis.. It's never going to be a gourmet restaurant or have foie gras so we all know it's got what American's love. Burgers, Nachos, Salads, and the like. That being said, this place isn't all that bad. It has relatively quick seating, and the staff I have found to be rather friendly.  As for the To Go options, I had my first experience ordering online, and paying before hand online as well. Unfortunately, when I arrived they were out of the sweet potato fries I had ordered and asked if I wanted regular fries. I was fine with that, but I assumed they would change my bill and refund me the extra money that it cost me for sweet potato fries. Unfortunately I was wrong. I wasn't asked about it and when I did, wasn't offered the money back. I wasn't overly upset because it was a a buck or two more, but still, money is money.

Kayla M.,"Monterey, CA",30,40,4,3.0,8/5/2012,"I mean, I guess I like Chili's, but I have been eating at Chili's since the time I ordered from the kid's menu. As the food is now good, not exceptionally great, it really is not the same as it used to be. It is decent for the convenience and price though. The food used to be really, really great. Not five star, but not one step above fast food, (which is what it has become now) either. I have been visiting this restaurant for well over a decade, and I have seen about five major menu changes/overhauls.. each time the prices rise, the menu items change, or are adjusted, and the quality of the food is affected poorly. There is no avoiding it. I used to visit for the hamburgers. They came with an amazingly fresh tasting, juicy patty which came packed with all sorts of flavor. Then topped with juicy, meaty bacon, real cheddar, quality bread, fresh, crisp produce etc. All coming together for that certain ""great burger"" flavors giving us that taste our mouth's water for. Their burger nearly had it all, and they have slowly let it slip away.... Now they remind me of a $6.00 burger from Carl's Jr. Well, if you join their email club you get a free queso dip for doing so and receive coupons and notifications for the kids eat free days and what not. I enjoy redeeming the free appetizer or dessert coupons.  The egg rolls are amazing. The QUESO dip is grrrreeat! The chicken enchilada tortilla soups is super good too. Sliders are pretty good. Burgers ok a little dry, inconsistent, some days better than others The Philly cheesesteak is actually not bad if you order no cheese sauce and get regular cheese. It is too greasy the way they serve - even thought thats the classic preparation. Decent fries. Pretty good buffalo chicken ranch sandwich.  Decent bar.

albert r.,"Quantico, VA",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2013,"My worst Chili's experience, ever. Bad service from the hostess and server. Cold and bland tasting food. Over and under cooked steak. Save your time and money, stay away from this place. I recommend going to LaLa Grill.  The story.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews, but I feel especially compelled to write this one. Came for dinner with my family on Friday, Aug.16, at approximately 9:30pm. Had not been to this Chili's restaurant in Seaside in over 2yrs. I have had great dining experiences at other Chili's locations I've been to so far; usually ordering the classic sirloin steak. We walk in and are met by the hostess. We inquire about their Happy Hour, asking, ""what time does your happy hour end?"" The hostess did not know this basic information and tells us so. So we ask her, ""is there maybe someone you could ask?"" She asks a nearby coworker who also does not know. The hostess turns back to us with a blank look on her face and again tells us that she does not know. She then stares at us for several seconds rather than find the answer to our simple question. I say in my head, ""well, go find the answer!"" My sister takes initiative and walks over to a table, picks up a menu and locates the information in less than 15sec.  We were seated with no wait time. I looked around, and noticed the place seemed unusually slow for a restraunt on a Friday night.  I ordered the classic sirloin steak, cooked to medium (pink in the middle), w/ mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and Texas toast. My wife ordered the same meal as I, except she ordered her steak cooked medium-rare w/ no Texas toast. We waited 17min. for our food. It did not arrive hot and my food was pretty bland. My steak was cooked practically to well done as there was was very-very little pink left. It looked like shoe leather. My wife's steak was cooked to medium and there was toast on her plate.  I showed my steak to the waitress and she returned it to the kitchen. While I waited, I went onto Yelp to check the reviews for this place and it only had 2.5 stars out of 69 reviews, highlighting horrible service and cold food. 7min later she brings my plate back. My steak was cooked to med-rare this time.  Not wanting to send my food back a third time in fear of them tampering with it, I cut my losses and started to eat. Everything on my plate was Luke warm. The steak was undercooked and unflavorful. The mashed potatoes were decent but cold. The broccoli  and Texas toast was also bland and cold. I will not patron or recommend this restaurant (Chili's in Seaside, Ca) to anyone in the future.  Recommendations for this restaurant to improve their customers experience: Train all employees on general knowledge of the menu.

As a work-in-progress society, it seems the ""cool"" thing to do is revolt against big business, regardless of the industry and spread anti-corporation sentiment as far as the eye can see.  Get over it, there's a reason these businesses are lauded, they know what they're doing. With that said, being that it's a ""chain"", you already know what to expect when you walk into the place.   The walls are saturated with Tex-Mex decor, the lighting is dim and overall the environment is pretty relaxed.   As others have correctly stated, the food is just alright, well...aside from the White Molten Cake, which is probably one of the best dessert items ever created! Chili's gets a three because the food quality and the service are inconsistent.  At times, the food is very good.  Other times, not so much.  At times, the service is on point.  Other times, not so much.  Chili's is hit or miss and if you don't mind occasional lackluster service, then give it a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=100

I ordered the parmesan encrusted tilapia  which came with a side of broccoli and their rice (which was not Mexican, I thought that was odd) and the chicken was placed on top of the rice, ultimately causing the rice to be drenched in oil and fat that probably came from the deep fryer the chicken was cooked in. THE BROCCOLI WAS PERFECT. I am very picky with how my broccoli is cooked and the green vegetable was just perfect. The tilapia for one smelled fishy and I after I got through half of the large fillet I literally choke on all of the spices, which for the first half of the fillet seemed non existant, and our lovely waiter comes over and asks if I was okay and I would like my dish traded out because she could smell the overload of spice from three feet away.

Sorry had to, that is the first thought that came into my mind when a friend suggested that we come here for a late night dinner.  They were open until 11pm tonight which was nice since most every other dining option in Monterey would have included a bunch of drunks and people spilling booze all over you.  Saying that, I'm usually on the other side, and I rarely go out to eat dinner past 10pm, I just go to get semi-faded. So my last visit to Chili's was in Denver off 15th Street or was it 16th Street (the main drag) where Chili's is a happening spot in D-town... lunch, forgetaboutit packed... the time before I hadn't hit puberty yet.    True story. This awkwardly located Chili's (behind the enormous also awkward pink Embassy Suites) is also huge inside and reminded me of a better looking Chevy's.  We had a solid time and the staff was uber friendly and we enjoyed our dinner on one of the booths near the bar.  Bartender looked like a nice guy (I was being very good not ordering a Marg or two) and our main server was super friendly as were the other guys that stopped by to check on us. Food was fine.  I was stoked to try the Texas Cheese Fries (reminds me of Irish Nachos) and not bad with their Ranch dressing, I dug the pickled jalapeños but surprisingly the bacon bits... not so much.  I like my fries soggy just putting it out there.  We got the 2 for $20 combo which is a stupid deal (good that is) and I got the Ribs and my friend the Bacon Burger.  We were going to split them but I ended up eating all the ribs (only half rack or 4 ribs) and there wasn't much meat on them and they weren't falling of the bone but they were tasty and I enjoyed the BBQ Sauce (Shiner Bock BBQ Sauce).  I took a bite of the real bacon from the burger and it was lovely.  The burger looked perfect, medium rare (executed perfectly), fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes and the bacon nice and crispy.  The bun was even soft and fresh.  Amazing. Oh we upgraded our side on the entree for salad which was a buck more and although it was a standard salad it did have some cheese (yeah it was shredded but what do you expect), diced cucumbers (never have been served diced cucumbers before), cheesy croutons (not talking with cheese) and a whole bunch of sliced red onions which I love but there were just way too many.  But overall not bad. I've always thought of Applebee's and Chili's the same (level of everything) but I'm started to think Chili's is a nice step up from Applebee's whose atmosphere is always dark and dreary.  I've only been to Applebee's twice, both times I had to be dragged in and I've only enjoyed the steak there and I was recently told by someone who has a friend that had worked in an Applebee's kitchen that the reason why their steaks are good is because they sprinkle some of that MSG right on there.... but it's just sugar right??? Anyways, the ambiance was warm and inviting tonight at Chili's even though the majority of the front portion of the restaurant (right side when you walk in) was closed and roped off by an imaginary something.  I'd love to go back here and grab a drink at their nice looking bar.  Hope the margaritas are good because I can't stand a place that can't make a good one... come on people it's not that hard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=140

Pretty textbook Chili's I'm guessing.  The menu looks like every other large chain restaurant I have been in - lots of colorful pictures that are perfect airbrushed versions of the food they bring to the table.  Eli had Kraft Mac and Cheese and Annie ate the baby food we brought in.  Kate had a Margarita (she had plans for dinner later) and I had the combo fajitas.  They got the order wrong for mine.  I wanted the mix of chicken beef and shrimp and I got the chicken and beef (oh well) it was still yummy.  The tortillas were nice and warm and the plate of veg/guac/sour cream was fresh and delicious.  I had a couple of house margaritas which were good and salty.   I am guessing if I went back in 3 years the entire staff would have changed over and the experience would be identical to the one I had - very formulaic.  Totally acceptable and completely benign, but formulaic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=140
John K.,"Newton, MA",11,15,,1.0,5/9/2009,"This particular location of Chili's started a now lifelong aversion to the chain for me.  This was back in about 2005.  I never liked them previously- all salt and fat with no flavor - but I'd eat at them occasionally on a work trip.  Then I went to this one and got some kind of southwestern/mexican dish, fajita maybe, and it was the usual tastelessness, but really exceptionally missing some depth of flavor.  This thing was screaming out for some seasoning, so I asked the waitress for some cumin.  ""What'd you say?""   I try this about 3 times with her until it is clear she hasn't ever heard of cumin.  She does humor me by going in back and asking for some, and comes back with a shaker of their seasoning salt mix.  I know and you know that one can't expect too much from a chain restaurant, but come on here.  Chili's presents itself as a southwestern/tex-mex kind of place that seems like they ought to have some idea of what to do with a reasonable variety of spices.  Their tagline is ""Life's too short for bland meals."" after all.  Now I'm packing cumin on business trips and generally avoiding Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=140

You guys aren't that busy to where you should run out of high chairs! We had to sit the baby on the table to feed her until a highchair became available, luckily one became available before our dinner was served. Prior to our dinner being served I notice a piece of paper folded in half sitting in the middle of our table, I grabbed it to take a look and someone had wadded up a piece of their ""ABC"" gum in the middle of the paper, I guess the bus person missed that when they cleaned our table!

Rachel C.,"Salinas, CA",7,15,4,2.0,8/27/2014,"The minute we sat down our waitress informed us that the kitchen was going to be closing down soon and that we needed to make a selection if we wanted something specific. Wow, why even seat us then? We googled to see when they closed and it said 1030 online, but she informed us that that was incorrect and it was actually 10p. Ok, not too bad since we arrived at about 9:30p. So, right then and there we had to make our order. I didn't even peak at the menu and just went with the thing I loved to eat at the Salinas location, Monterey Chicken. The chicken was cooked pretty well, but the sauce tasted weird and sour. I guess different locations make their own interpretations of a dish? The gravy that we had tasted off too. It just wasn't a good experience at all. Oh, and not to mention the silverware!! It is totally distgusting. First set I had had some leftover green sliver of food and the forks are grimy with bits and pieces of food. GROSS!  I had to wipe down my own silverware. I know this is a chain restaurant and I can't expect 5 star quality, but that is just not sanitary. I will say that throughout the meal the waitress made up for her rudeness, but it was just not enough. I do not plan to eat here ever again. Drive or walk a bit further and enjoy some Black Bear or shoot, Denny's has better food and service then here. We tipped a decent amount because being a server is hard work, but it would have been more if our meal didn't start out with us feeling unwanted and rushed.

The bloomin onion looked pretty nice when it came out.  It was amazingly salty, saltier than other chilis chains.  We had it with ranch and BBQ.  The ranch wasnt very zesty and the BBQ sauce was too zesty.  The BBQ sauce tasted more like ketchup gone wrong. I had a quarter of the old fashioned hamburger and well, it was a hamburger.  The triple meat tortilla thing was alright.  I made a taco first, found out it was terrible, then just ate some of the meat by itself. Our bill was $40 total.  I could have easily spent the same amount of money with just me and patty (2 entrees and an appetizer), but im glad i didnt.  I didnt fill myself up with all the terrible food so im writing this review a little hungry.  I do have a stomach ache if that counts towards anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=160

Ashley D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,16,1,1.0,6/20/2013,"Our experience here was horrific. We came in for an early lunch at 11 to beat the crowds, we were greeted and seated in a timely manner. Our waitress brought us our drinks and took our order...and from there it went straight to hell. While waiting for our food a huge group of 30+ people came in, they chose to sit this group all around us in different booths. I soon couldn't even hear myself talk because of the yelling this party of people was doing back and forth to each other. They were hanging over the booths, running from table to table, kicking the back of the booth seats...you would have thought these people were wild animals. They sat all 8 of the children which had to be 12 and under together in the table directly behind us with no parent. Come on, really? Where are these peoples manners? We waited for our waitress to come back to our table for a good 20min, hoping she would move us and by now I'm sure everyone can tell we are very annoyed. Another 10min go by...no waitress. My husband finally gets up to go look for her. Keep in mind we have been waiting for our food for close to an hour now. He finally finds her and she sends her manager over. We explain our unhappiness and ask for our food to go. She apologizes and says she will give us one meal free. We don't even wait at the table for our food. We get up and wait by the entrance and before they can even clean off our table the group of ""animals"" rushes in and starts eating off our Chips and Salsa plate. I'm shocked, and disgusted. They finally bring our food out to us and we go to the local 20th street park to eat , only to realize they haven't given us utensils with our ""to-go"" order or even napkins for that matter. By the time my husband drives back and returns with our utensils our food is not even warm anymore. My husband had ordered the fajitas and when he opens his box, they had forgot the tortillas. So he returns for a 3rd time. The manager apologizes over and over. By now we just want our money back. But the manager decides it fair to give us $30 in ""Chili's Cash"" instead, when our party of 5 clearly payed over $70 with lunch and drinks...really? Like I'm ever coming back here again!
