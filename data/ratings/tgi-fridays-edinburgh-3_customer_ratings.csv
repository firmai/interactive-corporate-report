2,Diana T.,United Kingdom,0,7,,1.0,2015-09-24,"To begin on the positive note, the stuff is amazing, really friendly, even though i could go without being called darling every time the waitress comes.  To skip the rest and go to why i didn't enjoy the restaurant - the starters first: i hated the curly fries. It's like biting into a piece of wood. I had the cheese dipping sauce, it had an awful taste.  For the main course we all ordered burgers and i was the only one to get a burned one. At first all i could taste was blend and bitter meat, when i looked inside the burger was completely black.  Inside were once again the dreaded wooden curly fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-edinburgh-3,,,,,

I've been regularly to this restaurant at fort kinnaird as they do mon to fri deals with two courses. As I have a weakness for wings, that's pretty much the only starter I've ever had and it's great! Always hot, tasty, great portion size and the blue cheese dip is to die for  I then had the half rack of ribs and they were tender, falling off the bone. I asked for a side salad instead of chips and was present with a huge salad, really delicious! And don't even get me started on the sharing dessert, we shared a brownie with ice cream and it was heaven! The service here is always fantastic, staff are friendly and attentive and go that extra mile. I know TGI's work hard to train them that way and it shows. High five!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-edinburgh-3,,,,,
