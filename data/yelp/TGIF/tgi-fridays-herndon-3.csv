Another server accidentally dropped ranch all over the floor and under our table, which wasn't a huge deal until our waitress came over and sighed while looking at us implying we made the mess. I kindly stated that we did not make the mess, and that another server had dropped it. Our drinks were not once replenished. We had to ask another waiter for our second round of ""endless apps""...which we didn't receive. It was a complete mess and a waste of $50+.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=40

Food is, well, the stuff on Friday's menu: burgers, ribs, steaks,  a few salads, and the bar-food appetizers. (A few trendy small plates thrown in too.) Strong drinks.  This location is moderately clean and has spotty service: some servers are attentive and knowledgeable...others really aren't. I come back mostly when my wife suggests it.

Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65,1.0,7/8/2014,"I don't hate TGI Fridays, nor do I love it. I'm generally impartial as far as chain restaurants go as I know what to expect. I've been to this location a few times over the past few years and had decent service, but they've since changed their menu and have removed a lot of the lighter options (wraps). It's never been great, but it's definitely gotten worse. All of our food was drenched in grease and oils, to the point the hamburger buns were so thoroughly soaked they were dissolving. When you're eating and notice giant globular pools of grease forming in your food it's rather off-putting and turns you off from eating. Our waitress was a bit of a mix. One of my companions ordered their ""unlimited"" appetizers, but was told right off the board that if he shares one (or we take one) she has to stop serving him completely. Are potato skins THAT important that they need to come with a disclaimer you're going to stop serving us if somebody liberates an appetizer? If I'm paying for his unlimited appetizer and I take one why are we punished? She later came back and told us that her manager was encouraging them to be the food police, but that felt rather awkward. Order a meal, get a warning! At least the warning was complimentary. My wife wanted to try their chicken salad, but it came with cranberries (she's not a fan of 'em). We asked if it was possible to have the cranberries removed and were told it's pre-made, and then our waitress added she's not going to personally remove the cranberries from our order. Uh, okay? We didn't ask you to do that, but that's good to know. In short: bad service, overly greasy, oily food. I figure my pictures can speak for themselves. Disappointment level: chartreuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=40

It's so quiet in there you almost feel as though you have to whisper. I've been going to Friday's ALL OVER since I was a teenager, and I've never experienced one so boring. I frequent this location a lot because it's the closest to my house & the happy hour deals of course. But, it needs some serious flair & QUICK!  On one of our experiences there was a large group of us at the BAR, and the older male waiter that works there literally yelled at us for being too loud. Have you ever heard of a quiet bar?  Lately we've been trying to sit outdoors so we don't feel so uncomfortable. If the Bar Louie across the street had a longer happy hour we'd surely go there instead.

Chris T.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,4,2.0,5/10/2016,"For the most part this is a pretty typical Fridays location, with the exception of the service which is significantly below par and really hampers the entire experience. The restaurant itself is clean with totally acceptable decor. The food consists mostly of American bar food and it's mostly solid if uninspired. I will mention that the burgers tend to be pretty low quality given their cost, I would be hesitant to get any burgers or steaks here. The biggest issue is that the service at this location is just incredibly slow. Everything from taking our orders to getting our food out to bringing us our checks takes longer than it should, especially considering there were fewer than a dozen customers in the entire restaurant. It makes for a really frustrating experience when you're just trying to get a quick bite to eat during your lunch hour and it takes 10+ minutes after you sit down to even see your waitress. If you have a lot of time to kill and are craving some fried bar food, then maybe give Fridays a shot.

Since Charlie Changs  closed, not much there that appeals to my guy. He'd seen the ads for ribs at TGIF, tho, and wanted to give that a try. (Those ribs look darn good.) We got there about 5:30pm on Sat. Not too crowded & we asked if we would get served at the bar since we wanted to watch college football. The host showed us to a bar table & said, ""Your server will be right with you."" Fifteen minutes later I went down to the host desk & told him no one had been by. He was very apologetic - could not have been nicer - & assured us someone would be right with us. About 5 minutes later we saw him talking to a man in another area. Tables in that area were being served. The host actually pointed to us, saying something we couldn't hear - presumably, ""They want to place their order..."" - the man nodded, turned & went into the kitchen & we never saw him again, Another 5 minutes & husband said, ""Let's go. Houlihan's is just across the street & we know we'll get served there."" I couldn't argue. Clearly we weren't going to get served. So we walked by the host stand. He was talking to someone & didn't see us.  Guess we'll have to find a Ruby Tuesday's for ribs.

Lisa D.,"Ashburn, VA",148,93,59,2.0,3/10/2017,"Our visit to this TGI Fridays began going downhill when, minutes after being seated, we spotted a mouse running across the floor towards the kitchen. We spoke to a manager, who apologized, told us that they use a weekly preventative for mice, and said that he would cover our check if we chose to stay. We decided to risk it. The food was good, but the service was lacking. My coworker's appetizers (he ordered the endless apps) came out after meals were served and, despite placing an immediate order for an appetizer refill, that refill didn't come out. After a long time, he wound up ordering a third appetizer, which came out before the second one...it was all very confusing. My other coworker had to ask multiple times for a simple box to package up her food. Everything was just really slow; it took us 90 minutes to have a very simple lunch. Then, the kicker, when we got our check, they didn't comp it after all. They took 50% off, but that wasn't what we'd been told would happen. It probably seems ridiculous to complain about 50% off, and I honestly wouldn't have complained if that's what we'd been told was going to happen. It just seems like really poor customer service to state one thing to get us to stay and then do something different. And, we didn't order gratuitously - we all had water, and, in total, the table's order was just 1 endless apps & 1 normal entree.

Kris R.,"Oakton, VA",12,16,1,3.0,5/12/2017,"I enjoy TGI Fridays for their massive selection of appetizers and long list of sides.  I only give three stars for this particular location because of problems with the facility.  The store is smaller than it looks so when it's full you're going to be knocking into people at the tables.  The rear section and the bar are several steps higher than the front end and you're rather uncomfortably close to the ceiling.  The ambient lighting is bad because the LED lamps in the restaurant and in the outside seating are randomly pulsing brighter and darker, making the dining experience somewhat psychedelic.  An electrician should pay them a courtesy visit and advise some corrective changes. In the front end of the store the fully upholstered chairs are a tight fit for adult males. For that reason I recommend sitting in the regular padded chairs, booths, and stools.  I have observed the service bar window staff have trouble with the POS equipment on more than one visit, but on a recent visit I see that the POS system has been upgraded to a fancy tablet which is running much more smoothly. I love their food.  It's not heavy and not salty which is a good combination.  The salads are a nice, low-fat, low-calorie alternative after you enjoy the appetizers.  The Million Dollar Cobb salad is only $11 and comes with grilled chicken, making it an excellent and healthy choice, with a very delicious take on the new Green Goddess dressing concept.  It's a true Cobb salad. I should note that I formerly recommended instead visiting the Fairfax location but after my recent visit in Herndon I can say this location has improved, but I still recommend avoiding the tiny upholstered chairs in the front (there are fewer now, replaced with regular wooden, padded chairs).  The Jack Daniels Sampler appetizer is spectacular and I also recommend the half-rack of ribs with Jack Daniels sauce and a spinach side.  The Sampler has a 1/3 rack from what we can tell.  If your party has a ribs lover get them a half rack and get the rest of your party the Sampler.  You will all be happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3

Waited 45 mins before appetizers and kids food arrived.  Waiter said our food order got bumped because of two large parties that had come in.  our steaks hadn't been done yet, and we had to leave for movie, so we asked waiter to stop order and put back in for after movie.  He said fine, we paid bill, but then the manager came to table and said steaks were done.  when i explained that we had to leave for movie, had been waiting for over 45 mins at that point, and had already arranged with waiter, she was unhappy.  she said 'well, your food is ready now.  just take it to go.""  I told her I didn't want to do that since we were already late and then our food would be sitting in our car for two hours and she rolled her eyes and walked away.  My kids asked me why the lady was mad at mommy.  the other 2 adults besides myself were shocked at her attitude as well.  my waiter apologized and assured me he would take care of us.  so we left.  after movie, we returned and he brought the food to me to go in less than 5 mins.  he assured that he had doubled checked the food and sides himself and again apologized.  he made excuse for manager, saying she was frustrated with kitchen, but she didn't come out herself.  our food was barely warm, so it probably did just sit there under lamps for two hours anyway.   Bottom line, we were disgusted with the manager and she ruined our experience with TGIFridays (normally a place we like to go).  We've never gone to the Herndon location before and don't know that we'll ever try one again.  The manager's name was Natalie and she royally sucked.  She should not be in a position of authority, let alone in customer service. Caleb, our waiter, should have her job.  He handled himself well, accepted my complaint and tried to make it right.  I am very disappointed in TGIF Herndon (save our waiter, Caleb).  Oh, and my ""10oz steak with lobster topping"" was about 4oz with the tiniest little lobster bits I've ever seen.  Bonus!! -Adrienne",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=60

Youre going to need to wait till the lettuce seedling starts to grow! Seriously, this restaurants kitchen is slow. Its beyond slow. There isnt an adjective to describe how slow.

Jane O.,"Sterling, VA",118,37,27,3.0,11/6/2012,"Where to start? I LOVE Fridays.. I always hear negative things about Fridays but its really one of my favorite places!!  It was love at first taste about 8 years ago when I got a job as a hostess at the Sterling location.  Although my job only last a year, my love for Fridays has lived on!! Since the Sterling location closed Herndon is the next best location. Food: They have a variety of appetizers such as pot stickers, wings, spinach artichoke dip, tostado nachos, spicy queso,  hummus etc..Their main courses such as cajun shrimp pasta, flat iron steak, caribbean chicken sandwich, sizzling chicken and cheese, and any of the Jack Daniels options(chicken, steak and burger) are DELICIOUS!! Happy Hour: M-F 4-9pm Offers $2 domestic drafts, $3 imported and $4 margaritas, mojitos and long islands. From 4-Close they offer select half price appetizers and after 9pm they have select $5burgers Fridays Rewards: its free to sign up and is awesome to have if you are a repeat customer like me. One point for every dollar you spend which you can later redeem for free food.  Also make your to ask for the free rewards chips..theyre unlimited and yummy! The service there is hit or miss.  One server who does stick out for great customer service and friendliness is a guy named Matt! Make sure to request him! Last but not least...Stop being stingy with the fries when you order burger or sandwiches especially the sweet potato fries(if you notice in my pic, i got about a handful)..

Roger B.,"Herndon, VA",9,141,7,2.0,5/11/2016,"TGIF might want to simplify their coupons and deals since it seems to confuse staff at this restaurant. Went here because we had printed out one of their many email coupons. Our waitress told us about the refillable appetizers and some other menu deal. We showed her the coupon we had and asked if the coupon would be valid if we ordered any of the things she mentioned. I know that some of the time Fridays does not combine coupons and menu deals which is why I asked. The waitress took the coupon and went to ask someone and when she came back she told us it was ok. We ordered our food and everything was good. Finished up and asked for the check and it seemed to take a long while. Then a blond haired manager comes over and starts giving us a hard time about how the coupon couldn't be combined with what were ordered, blah blah blah. And I told her that we had asked the waitress if it was ok before we ever ordered anything but go ahead and add whatever to the bill and I'll pay it. She said she went ahead and put the coupon on the check which made me wonder why she was even over there talking to us. If we are getting what we expected to on the bill then their is no problem for us and no reason for a manager to approach us and gave us a hard time. It was nice of her to give us the coupon even though the waitress had told us it was fine. But, we had just finished a nice meal and really didn't need to hear the stuff she was saying. If the waitress or the person the waitress talked to made a mistake, tell them. Not me. I don't work for you and really don't need to hear it. If the coupons are that complicated then come up with a better system. Was def a bad ending to a dinner And now we never go anymore.

For the past 3 years I haven't even given this restaurant chain a second glance. Poor food and worse service at so many various locations taught me a lesson:Avoid Fridays-Be Happy! However the Herndon location definitely made me satisfied and actually looking forward to another visit. First off, their happy hour -food and beverages are shockingly inexpensive! I can remember my last Friday's meal being overpriced and unappealing. So I ordered a fresh strawberry daiquiri and it lived up to its name! It was light, very fresh and a thirst quencher.Good deal! We also ordered potstickers as a shared appetizer . They come 6 to an order and while they weren't amazing -they were pretty good. An easy appetizer before the grand finale! So I skimmed the menu but I generally order the same entrees from my past visits. This time was no different -I ordered the chicken tenders (yes I'm an adult of 25 years old-please don't judge me ) and subbed the fries for loaded mashed potatoes. Wow! They were better than I remember - the chicken was incredibly hot and fresh-the potatoes were warm with melted cheddar , real bacon, and chives-yum! And you can't visit a Fridays without a side of Jack Daniels sauce. I cleared my plate! My best friend ordered her usual-Jack Daniels Fried Shrimp entree and loaded mashed potatoes as well.

To start off our family was seated in the seat NO one wants to sit in, the one right next to the bathroom. We had a server that couldn't have cared less about our table. It was some of the worst service we have had at any restaurant. We ordered 2 appetizers since we had small children with us and would have enjoyed eating something early. After about 20 minutes, our server brought out our ENTREES and no appetizers.  We asked about the appetizers and he just shrugged and asked what we ordered. The food was less than desirable. Two people at the table ordered the Jack Chicken and Shrimp meal for $17 each. The chicken was barely 4oz and the 6 sad looking shrimp appeared to have been microwaved. The Parmesan fries were soggy and the sauce was not pleasant. Additionally, the broccoli that was provided was a just one large piece, barely cooked, and not cut up. Just a chunk of broccoli.  I had the Bourbon chicken meal with 2 sides for $11.  Again a HUGE disappointment with the dry 4oz chicken and undercooked broccoli. The mac and cheese is the only good thing that we had and that was for my toddler.  The server only returned 1 time during the entire meal to get us drinks and continued to forget items that we had requested.  The only timely thing he provided was the check.

In reality, this $12 burger was less appealing than those served at your corner fast food restaurant. Here is the breakdown: The burger was supposed to come with 2 patties, bacon, onions, roasted peppers, sauce and cheese.  The 2 patties ended up being two paper thin slices of beef (both stacked together would barely equal a McDonald's burger that you can get for $1.00).  The peppers were almost non-existent and the cheese looked microwaved.  The bacon was not fresh, and I could tell it was cooked long before I received it.  There was no sauce on the buns and the lettuce and tomato didn't appear fresh. The fries were even subpar.  To make matters worse, they even screwed up my caesar salad ($3.60 extra).  I complained and showed the waiter how horrible the burger looked inside.  Instead of comping the whole meal and apologizing, he tried to defend the restaurant and charged me for the salad.  I highly recommend that you skip Fridays and go across the road to Houlighans instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100

The waiters/waitresses aren't overly friendly but they get the job done. Food is pretty good, enough for us to come back every few weeks. This place is never really crowded, which works for us as we have a toddler, we want a place that is family friendly, and allows us to get in and out before a tantrum occurs. Right now they ask you to complete a survey after each visit, if you do you'll get a free appetizer your next visit. I love free food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100
Angie L.,"Austin, TX",690,363,1205,2.0,5/15/2011,"The only time I come to this location is before i go watch a movie at Worldgate theatres. The service from the waitstaff is average. I normally prefer servers that get me what i need (refills, napkins, etc) without bugging me all the time, on that note, I had to ask for my refills everytime. The food is average as well. One of the appetizer that i tried was the buffalo wings tossed in BBQ sauce. It was dry and only half my wings had sauce on it. The big party table that was next to us was way too close for comfort. I know its not their fault, but the tables put together was very close to the booths where we were sitted, otherwise the kids that were at the table shouting wouldnt have been as annoying as it was. Other than that, one of my favorite dessert is here, the vanilla bean cheesecake. That is something that I always get when i go to a TGIF's.

Mike H.,"Sterling, VA",5,170,,4.0,3/21/2011,"Alright so I have started coming here recently after a few years of not going to Fridays, and their new meal options are great. Being a picky eater I dont normally go for what real people would call food, that being said, Fridays now seems to offer adult oriented food that even appeals to me. The location isnt too bad although you will most likely have to park in the garage. It can get a bit loud at times although i have only been there on friday evenings (just works out that way). Not really sure about the temperature, it tends to be on the chillier side so you might want to bring a light jacket if you tend to be cold. The staff seem to be helpful. Pricing is rather reasonable for the food and they have some good options available. As with most restaurants like this you can expect to pay ~$6 on up for anything alcoholic.  They do seem to haev coupons everywhere at the moment though so you can get some really good discounts, most likely wont last though since they are busy trying to advertise the ""new"" Fridays. Overall i recommend hitting this place up if you are looking for something decent without spending too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100

William T.,"Manassas, VA",0,15,,1.0,2/19/2015,"I went to T.G.I Friday's on Friday evening with my wife, and as soon as I went to the door, There was a guy standing by the door giving us dirty looks, That guy is actually the door man or the body guard that harasses people as soon as they walk to the door, I felt intimidated and was disgusted specially he was starring at my wife. I felt I was at a club not a restaurant. Why do you need a guy standing by the door to harasses people and give them the stair down. I waited 10 minutes by the door and they were not that busy before getting seated, my wife wanted to go, she did not feel comfortable, specially the bodyguard that was standing up with a T.G.I Friday's names badge was standing up giving us the stair down they he sat dawn and he was trying to look up my wife skirt, he figured he can get a better look sitting down than standing up. He was a black gentleman, I think he was wearing glasses. My wife noticed that quick and she said let's go honey, it is not worse it. Finally the hostess, she was in the back flirting with one of the guys in the back. I convinced my wife to sit down, my wife said that this is the last time that she will go there because of the guy standing by the door like a bodyguard or pretending to be security with a T.G.I Friday's name tag. Finally we sat down and the table was dirty, we had to wait ten to fifteen minutes before anyone noticed us, we did not even get silver wear. Finally after waiting 10 to 15 minutes, we told him that we need the table cleaned because it was dirty, he said let me go and to the back and get a rag to clean the table, so we ordered our drink's and waited about 10 minutes before he showed up with the drink and clean the table. The service does not get any slower than that. Finally I ordered the Jack Daniel's Sirloin and I wanted to get it well done, and my wife ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, we waited about 40 minutes for our food. When I got the streak it was not well done and told the waiter and when I told him he seemed mad and he said that is the best I seen them to, but I will go ahead and try, also my wife's sizzling chicken was over cooked and little dried up, we did not complain knowing the service was bad and waiter might get mad and do something to our food. Finally I got the steak, and they have burned it and it tasted  awful, at this point I just ate the mashed potatoes and vegetable and I just wanted to leave. we asked for the check and the bill was about 49 dollars and some change. I put one hundred dollar bill and the waiter finally come back and first time he smiles because he knows that this is the time that he makes tips and had the guts to ask me if I wanted a change back, assuming I was going to give him a fifty dollars time, I said yes I do need change and his face turned red when he found out that the fifty dollar tip is not for him. finally I got the change back and I gave 5 dollars tip for this lousy, and when he saw that it was 5 dollars, he was very mad and he did not even said thank you form coming or stop back. I will never ever go to this place anymore, this is the worst service I have gotten in my life. If I can I wanted to give them a zero as a score. This guy standing or sitting by the door is very bad, I will never go there because of him. Do not bring your wife or girl friend they going to be harassed by the door man. We were not impressed by this place, the service and the quality of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100
Jesse C.,"Leesburg, VA",179,314,250,4.0,5/20/2010,"If you are looking for a cheap lunch than you really can't beat Fridays.  They offer a lunch menu with burgers and salads.  If you do it right you can get out for $10 or so.   The service here is fast and the people are friendly.  If you are coming for lunch you want to get there a little earlier, the parking at World Gate can be a bear sometimes. I figure I should write a review now.  I've now been here 3 times in two months so I guess its due.  The first time I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger from the lunch menu.  They cooked it more than the medium that I requested but that was o.k.  The burger itself actually had some decent flavor as did the fries.  The next two times I ordered the all you can east salad and soup combo.  Not too shabby for $7 bucks.  For $7 bucks you also get a soda.  The clam chowder is good as is the broccoli cheese soup.  Those were the only two soups they had available those days.  As for the salad, you really can't mess that up.  The Cesar salad is good and not over dressed with the dressing.  And the best part ALL YOU CAN EAT =).   I have had other things here but those are just your typical chain type of foods.  Wings, steaks, ribs, and so on. The food here really isn't that bad, but things can get pricy if you come for dinner.  So if you want a cheap and fast lunch then this is one of your best bets.  So why the 4 stars for this chain restaurant?  Why not, the food I had was good, the service was good, and the price was just right =)  Oh yeah, this is only for the lunch rush.  I have not had dinner at this location yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=100

For entrees, I got the half rack of baby back ribs which came with ginger slaw and ""seasoned fries"".  The ribs were properly cooked and the meat was falling off the bone.  The sauce had some kick to it which gave the ribs a nice flavor.  The slaw had too much dressing but was still edible---nothing to write home about but no complaints either.  The seasoned fries were at their best when eaten when they were still hot. My husband and my dad both got the petite sirloin, with my dad topping his with lobster sauce.  When they say ""petite"", they mean it---it's a small, thin piece of meat.  Both got their sirloins cooked properly.  My husband said that it was a tough little steak.  I reminded him that this wasn't a steakhouse plus it wasn't expensive so you get what you pay for.  Still, both of them finished their meals. To sum it up --- Friday's is the type of place where you can expect to get your money's worth and find decent, if not remarkable food.  Yet it's not the type of place where you dream about going back to very soon.  That said, no doubt we will return at some point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=80

My colleague saw a mouse scurry across the dining room floor and the manager did not act like he cared at all. Our waiter seemed concerned but had to go back and request the manager's presence TWICE.  Once he did come out, he was not worried or remorseful. He told us (in a hushed voice) that the mouse comes in from the outside, he was aware and is taking care of it. I would have been grossed out without this reaction, but I understand that it can happen because restaurants are mice magnets. His reaction was inexcusable, however. It did not make me feel confident that he would do anything about it ever. If I were a manager, I would act apologetic and offer a discount or comped a dessert (I have been offered that for less). I would assure my customer that it is a priority to remove the mouse.  I am not a complainer (this is my first Yelp review) and I only bring something to the manager's attention if I feel I cannot keep it quiet (I received the aforementioned dessert because we found a label in our nachos).

My wife and I went to this restaurant before and we weren't satisfied but that was a long time ago and long before I even heard of Yelp. I honestly feel like this Friday's menu needs to be consolidated or reorganized. They had a lot of stuff on the menu which only confused me. At least the menu should of had a specialty section, that showed me the items they were experts at making, but it didn't.  I also feel like they should denote on their menu which food items are spicy. I say that because my wife isn't a fan of spicy foods so the item she ordered she couldn't enjoy it because it was spicy. She explained to me that it didn't taste bad but she just couldn't enjoy it. It was the same for me, for the item I ordered  however, I'm not bothered by spicy foods so it wasn't as bad for me.  Our server was a little slow at times which was weird because we were here on a Sunday during lunch hours so the restaurant wasn't packed at all.  I don't know what it is about Friday's but no matter what, it seems that our experience is never really that pleasant.  I don't know maybe this place is better for happy hour. The food isn't bad it's just we would like better service and at least someone explain to us that we are ordering an entrée that is spicy since it isn't denoted in the huge menu.

Now, the food is alright, nothing fancy, nothing spectacular, but quite edible.  Out of all offerings, I think my favorite is the Jack Daniels chicken strips.  DO NOT TRY THEIR MAHI-MAHI -- They have no idea how to cook fish.  But what really shines is the cheap drinks; happy hour on-tap starts at 2 bucks (1 @ $2, 1 @ $3 rotates every day of the week), although the $2 variety are usually ""Lite"" beers - hey, better than ice-tea, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Phyllis C.,"Manassas, VA",7,45,,2.0,7/10/2011,"The food at this Friday's location is good . . . whenver you can get it.  I have to say, I've visited this location several times since it's close to work.  Each time just hoping something would be different.  That's been insanity because each time, I believe the service gets even slower.  I've tried going early (around 11:30am), I've tried going later in the lunch rush hour (12:30 - 12:45pm).  No difference, service is still slow.  If you have time to kill, then this TGI Fridays is the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Grace P.,"Arlington, VA",2,34,1,2.0,9/29/2010,"Went there for happy hour on a weeknight.  Sat at the bar, waited several minutes for a single bartender to greet us - there were 3 females tenders and each passed us at least 3 times.  Not the friendliest staff.  Didn't see smiles or enthusiastic characters.  Didn't checked on us once to see if we needed anything else.     Happy Hour runs until 9pm.  $2 ML, BL, CL; $3 BM, and all Sams and $4 Margaritas and Mojitos.  1/2 certain apps. Atmosphere was bland.  Very dark and heavy feeling in the restaurant.  Bar area is tiny and this place looks like a commuter bar.  People step in for a beer and then leave immediately after.  Not a place to mingle amongst the patrons nor the staff! Try at your own risk.  Not a fan of the food and probably won't be revisiting this establishment any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Menage a T.,"Herndon, VA",2,20,4,2.0,11/18/2011,"I usually LOVE TGI Fridays, but this one was mediocure.  I went for lunch and although the service was good, the food wasn't the greatest.  Most the people at the table (there were 8 of us), said they had had better at other Friday restaurants.  I will be taking this place off my list for food, but add it for Happy Hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Suzanne H.,"Reston, VA",0,75,,3.0,7/9/2012,"I rarely go to Friday's, service is hit and miss, so is the food.  This time, service was good.  Food was confusing.  We ordered the $10 special, my BF got the pulled pork bbq (which he says is ok), I got the korean tacos (more on that in a minute), he got the ""beef"" queso appetizer and I got the peanut butter pie (we split those two items).  I also got the strawberry lemonade slushy.  What I got was a lot of strawberry something, no lemonade that I could tell, poored over some crushed ice, it wasn't even cold.  Just weird.  The queso was pretty good but the ""beef"" was a small spoonful of what tasted like Hormel no bean chili.  It was good but not exactly what we were expecting.  Which brings me to the Korean tacos.  First, they say they are korean bbq beef.  There were 3 very small pieces of beef in each taco (you get more meat at Taco Bell, no lie).  The asian lime/cilantro/ginger slaw?  It was very soggy and cooked lettuce, with way too much of some flavorless dressing, which poured out of the tortillas, there was so much, you couldn't even pick up the tortilla to eat it, it had a couple of shreds of carrot and a chunk of cucumber.  If there was ginger, lime or cilantro in there, it was definitely hiding.  And this was in no way slaw.  It was salad.  And not even a good one.  I do not like cooked lettuce so I picked it off and just ate the 3 pieces of meat per taco.  Couldn't even eat the tortillas as they turned to mush.  Thankfully, I filled up on the queso and since it was about a gazillion degrees, I wasn't that hungry anyway.  I really would have liked a cold slushie, though.   Anyway, keep expectations low and you'll do ok.  And don't go during a busy time, the service will be non-existent.  If you go during a slow period, it's pretty good.   We'll probably go back, we go there about every six months or so, just for something different.  But I ask myself Why every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Enver A.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,2,3,2.0,6/24/2012,"Although we mentioned we didnt eat pork, we got pork dumplimgs. The steak felt like we were eating a piece of wood. Burger was quite OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Jane P.,"Washington, DC",27,281,38,3.0,6/15/2009,"Today at lunch I was getting fired up, I mean FIRED UP, to write a scathing review about the consistenly bad service at this location. Then something happened.  My coworkers let another waitress know that we had been waiting for-EVER for our drinks, and all of a sudden our formerly suckin' waitress was much more on the money.   Of course, our appetizer plates that we requested arrived long after we had finally given up and devoured the appetizers straight from the serving dishes.  But that was before the service picked up. I have to give the waitress points for remembering my order of the salad, considering my detox diet requires that I ask for all the fun stuff to be removed from food.   The menu ain't half bad for a chain joint.  They've got some decently priced healthy lunch entrees near the back of the menu that tase a-ok. It's still a godawful chain, in my opinion, but one that my meat-loving coworkers enjoy.  And their company makes it worthwhile. Vegans beware: almost nothing on the menu, save for the fries, will fit your bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Katie C.,"Ashburn, VA",1,14,,3.0,4/29/2012,"I'm not sure if I actually got the 3 for whatever special.  I wasn't paying so i didn't see the bill and I didn't have full confidence that it was right.  The place was really busy but the service kept up with it decently.  Bathrooms were clean and the atmosphere high, and food the quality you'd expect from TGIFridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Mo C.,"Denver, CO",530,804,72,4.0,2/25/2009,"TGI Friday's is the same just about everywhere you go. In Virginia, it's a bit smokier than most, but the people that work there are pleasant and the food is average, but you always know what to expect. If you like your steak rare, this is probably not the place for you. It took multiple attempts on the part of the cook to come up with something that my co-worker would even eat. But, I have to say, the Championship NY Strip with the cheddar mashed potatoes is worth strolling in for. The Gourmet Mac n Cheese, not so much. But, this place always has great drink specials and a nice long happy hour until 9pm, so I'm sure I will find myself here again when in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
Blonde M.,"Herndon, VA",0,11,,2.0,1/9/2010,"It's okay- they don't have very many nice servers- actually, we've never had a nice one at this location.  The bartenders and pretty nice on Sundays during the football games, but the servers get mad if you don't order enough food and give you an attitude, which I think is unacceptable when they place is empty.  The food is okay, but the service is lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-herndon-3?start=120
