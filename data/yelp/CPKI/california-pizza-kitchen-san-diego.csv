Tom R.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/11/2018,"Went here for dinner after a movie. Seated immediately. Waited 15 minutes and no service. Several waiters walked by our table without acknowledgement. Spoke to host who said he would have someone right over. Saw waitress arguing with host, manager joined in. They split up with waitress pissed off.   Waited 3 more minutes with no one acknowledging us and decided to leave. We won't go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20
Ashley D.,"San Diego, CA",6,22,7,2.0,12/3/2017,"Two stars is being generous. The only good thing about our experience is that we were able to call ahead so we didn't have to wait long for a table. Once seated it took a very long time for our server to visit. She immediately said, ""Sorry for the wait i just got here."" Seemed unprofessional and perhaps poor planning on the hostesses part. She wasn't familiar with a margarita we requested, confirmed It with the bartender, then the wrong drink was still delivered. It took awhile to get her back to place our food order and the food was not worth the wait. Don't bother with the artichoke dip, it's disgusting. A few minutes before our food arrived she offered us bread with oil which was fine until I realized the table next to us had balsamic and oil with their bread. It was just one disappointment after another. We won't be visiting a CPK again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20

Diode D.,"San Diego, CA",357,205,253,3.0,1/27/2017,"We had an okay experience, mostly because of the service which was forgetful and ill-attentive.  Food: Had a mango, guava, lime cooler which was carbonated and yummy! It was super sweet and refreshing. We got two whole thin crust pies of spinach and artichoke and tostada pizzas. The thin crust was wonderful and the toppings were great. Love the tostada pizza and we even added avocado. Would go back for both pizzas they were yummy for a work lunch.  Service: We opted to sit outside because it was a sunny beautiful day. Our waiter pretty much forgot about us and was in a rush every contact with us, he was basically walking away whenever we asked for anything because he was rushing to go back inside. So... that happened. Parking: park by the amc parking structure, easier to get to the place. Overall, had a yummy work lunch and break, but the service was meh. The food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20
Louis P.,"San Diego, CA",713,355,546,3.0,11/20/2016,"Average food, average service, ehh. Came here for dinner before seeing a movie and left indifferent. Did I like it? No. Did I hate it? No.  It was pretty packed when I showed up, so there was a 10 min wait... understandable because it was a busy night. The service was on par with any other mass chain restaurant. I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza and after a short wait it came out. It was ok. Not the best, not the worst. I thought the price tag was a little ridiculous for the pizza I got, definitely overpriced pizza. I suppose you're paying for the sit down location of it. Overall, average ok experience. Would I come back? Well, I won't be running back, but if I'm at the mall... maybe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20
Saul A.,"San Diego, CA",88,31,20,3.0,1/1/2018,"For being called California pizza kitchen the pizza are not that good. I actually think Chuck E. Cheese has better pizza we ordered a pepperoni pizza and the California club which they should change the name to arugula club because the arugula was basically the main ingredient . We also ordered two pastas the garlic cream fettuccine which was not creamy it was dry. The other pasta that we order was the kung Pao spaghetti which was the only thing I really enjoyed, but I felt like I got ripped off with the amount of chicken that I paid extra for. I also did not like the over priced Caesar salad that we ordered I would understand if there was a twist or something special, but there wasn't definetely not worth my 12 bucks. The bread that they started us out with could had been good if it came with butter, but it came with oil instead which made the bread too greasy. And to top this review off we finish with 2 chocolate souffle with ice cream and I know souffles and those where the saddest souffle I have ever seen in my whole life, but fantastic service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20

Syl T.,"San Diego, CA",8,63,74,3.0,7/1/2017,"We stopped in for lunch after seeing the sign outside for the Seasonal Menu featuring strawberries. We had a minimal wait and the Host was friendly and welcoming. Once seated, it was only moments before the server arrived to take our drink order.  We let him know we were ready to order and he said that we'd made some good choices. The service was excellent, our server continually check on us throughout the meal without being overbearing or intrusive. The food was delicious, fresh ingredients and I highly recommend the Strawberry Salad with chicken and avocado; other protein choices included salmon and shrimp. Also, the Cucumber Non-Alcoholic Spritzer is a must try! It's amazing and a recommendation made by our server.

Jeb H.,"San Diego, CA",362,360,553,4.0,4/22/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen is better than I remember. I dined there with my girlfriend, and I have no complaints! Everything from the food to the service to the mellow ambiance. I appreciate how they bring fresh, warm bread and butter to the table because that seems like a rarity these days. It was a great beginning to the meal and ensured that I wasn't hungry while waiting for my meal. I ordered the pizza and salad lunch special, which is a better deal than ordering items by themselves. My Caesar salad was delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised by the shaved Parmesan. It added a lot of flavor. I would have preferred if it had been tossed before service, but that's a minor complaint. My personal pizza was their BBQ chicken specialty. They claim to be the inventors of the BBQ pizza, and while I don't know if this is accurate, the pizza was delicious! The crust was in between New York thin and regular thickness, and it had a good crunch. Each bite of the pizza with the combination of BBQ sauce, chicken, red onions, and cheese was a delight. Coincidentally, my girlfriend got the BBQ chicken salad. It was tossed in a light ranch dressing with BBQ chicken on top. I liked it better than I expected. It was a half-salad, but it was still more than she could eat in one sitting. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by California Pizza Kitchen, and I'll probably return soon to try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",266,814,3204,2.0,9/6/2016,More like 2.5 stars. Let's start with the service. After walking I had to seat myself. After five minutes the server comes and takes are drink order. So I decided to stared with a salad the BBQ chicken salad. After I got my salad it notice it was stale and dry. So I asked the server for another dressing as I noticed not enough dressing.  I ate less the half the salad and ordered a Thai chicken pizza. The pizza took almost 30 minutes. The chicken on the pizza was cold. As I was hungry I ate couple slices only. Not one time did the manager come over and ask can I get you something else. The server was the best part about the hole dinning experience.  Would I come back here again. The answer is no. If you can avoid the location I would. As we all know customer service is a hit or miss. No questions this CPK customer was a miss. You garage parking. Also a nice patio.

Erik R.,"San Diego, CA",224,9,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Went in last night after a movie. No hostess at the hostess stand, so we waited...and waited...and waited...we then went into the bar area and asked if we could sit at the high top in that section and were rudely informed by the waitress that ""the hostess will need to seat you"" to which I replied ""Well, the hostess is non existent. we've been standing there for ten minutes and no one has helped us.""(and fyi there were only a few tables occupied, so it wasn't like they were busy) She just looked at us and said ""you'll have to wait."" So we turned and walked out and ate at Stacked and had a fine meal there. I ate at the old location in Fashion Valley all the time and was always happy with the food and service. If the relocation to the downstairs section of the mall is any indication of what to expect, I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20
Jovin A.,"San Diego, CA",3,25,342,3.0,4/21/2017,"I stopped by for an order to go.  They had a separate area near the back of the restaurant to take your order and ring you up.  The cashier was friendly and helpful with my order.  I was told the food would take about 15 minutes, so we decided to sit outside and in the patio area.   As we walked to the patio area, I asked the host if he can have them bring our order outside when it was ready.  He said, ""We don't do that here.""  Wow!  Thanks for the effort... Another employee (I think he may have been a waiter) overheard and said he would try to keep an ear out for our order and bring it to us.  Thank you for that offer, sir.   As we waited outside, there were no other patrons in the area, but we noticed all the tables were dirty.  It wasn't until they saw or heard our reaction when they started to clean it up.  When 20 minutes passed, the food wasn't brought to us and we had to walk to he back to get our order. I still appreciated he offer though.

I ordered an iced tea and for my main course, shrimp scampi with slices of cucumbers in it. There was some noodles in it and a chicken soup base. It had a good amount of shrimp in it. I like how they didn't skimp out on the shrimp but I do wish there was more noodles. Overall very good! The service was excellent by our server. She checked up on our drinks. Food came out quickly. I was tempted to get dessert but maybe next time. Lots of tables inside. There was even a bar area but it was a small bar with some chairs. I'd definitely come back here again.

Tara R.,"San Diego, CA",11,95,43,4.0,8/30/2017,"I really like this location. When my dog was little, my mom and I came here all the time and ate outside in the patio area. All the servers are nice. You really can't go wrong ordering one of their delicious salads. I used to like the pizza but it seems so greasy to me now. I love love love the Fire Grilled Ribeye. So much flavor with the butter and blue cheese dressing on the top of the steak. The only thing about ordering this is that it's either a hit or a miss with whoever cooks it. Do not order medium well because your steak will come out so hard. Even when I order medium sometimes it's still over cooked. Like it said hit or miss but when it hits it's amazing. I really hope they don't end up moving this location to downstairs because parking is so convenient where it is now.

Fiona M.,"San Diego, CA",103,171,117,1.0,1/17/2017,"OMG! NEVER AGAIN! KEEP WALKING! Lots of better places to eat in this mall.  I thought CPK was a brand I could trust. NOT HERE! We started lunch around 3pm. It's a popular location, in a big shopping mall so we had a brief wait for a table. No problem.  We were seated in a nice booth and ordered drinks.  I got up to use the woman's restroom; it was VILE. I walked out, notified the hostess and asked for an alternative bathroom.  The hostess used her pen and pointed it over the bridge of my nose to direct me out a patio door to a mall restroom nearby. I had to step back. I don't know why she thought that was appropriate... People have different bubble spaces so...idk what that was about? Whatever. Anyway, I walked out the door she pointed to with her pen, and found an outdoor patio with no exit. Great.  So, I walked back into the restaurant, climbed over some children and people who were crammed in the entrance waiting to check in for a table, squeezed out the door and waiting in line for almost 10 min to use the mall restroom.  When I returned, our drinks had still not been served.  I asked to speak to the manager who arrived promptly. I explained the restroom situation. He returned later and stated the hostesses had taken care of the problem and he apologized for the inconvenience.  After all of that, we finally placed an order. My order was from the gluten free menu.  Almost 30 minutes later, a food runner appears with two pizzas that look relatively the same. I asked, ""Is that gluten free?""  Food Runner; ""Um, it doesn't' look like it. I am not sure. I don't really know. Do you want me to check?""  Me; ""Yes, yes I definitely want you to check."" Waitress came back owned the mistake and apologized. Gluten free pizza being rushed.  I really appreciate when people own their mistakes.  Gluten free pizza FINALLY arrived. We had a couple of other misunderstandings with the staff; we asked for water refills and only one empty glass was filled. Had to ask as second and third time. Relatively minor snafus. The waitress was super nice and owned every mistake.  Finally finished, I put down my credit card to pay.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands. REALLY? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME CPK! The revolting restroom had not changed since my first visit. UNBELIEVABLE! I again notified the manager.  CPK, if you have a restaurant that can seat 148 people, and a restroom with only two stalls...don't you think you could stay on top of keeping it clean? If you can't keep your restroom clean after a customer has informed you, what is going on with the food???  An hour and a half later, $53.18 down plus tip, several bizarre but forgivable incidents behind us, both my daughter and I banned this place for life. Daughter, ""Mom, I told you we should have gone to the Café at Nordstrom.""  Me; ""Sigh...yes, we should have.""  Sayonara CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20

It's my first time to hit this place and I'm interested in going again in the future.  I love the crunchiness of the avocado roll. It was a generous portion and I appreciate the two dipping sauce to choose from. The flavour was amazing.  The flatbread was pretty good. It had a little bit of heat, just enough that it's not boring to eat. I might try the mushroom next time I go.  The service was ok.

Dustin B.,"National City, CA",16,372,122,1.0,9/22/2016,"Wow, having been a regular here at this location for the last several years i am appalled by latest experience here.    Hence why they went from five stars to one and will never get my business again. To start it was the night before my wife's birthday and we wanted to spoil ourselves and be a little lazy. We placed an order through grubhub at 745, received a 'driver is on their way' notification about 15 minutes later. An hour and a half later we still hadn't got our food so my wife started calling, the conclusion was that the grubhub order would be cancelled and we would put an identical order in directly and i would pick it up.  No problem with cpk yet, at this point they seemed to be wanting to help. I went to the take out window at cpk and the lady asked me if i was the one who had the grubhub issue.  I said yes, and she stated that the order would be ready in five minutes because pizzas were still in the oven.   No problem yet.  I asked to pay, she accepted, i paid and sat down at the bar and waited. Then some lady came over and dropped the salads and apps on the bar and said the pizzas would be up soon.   I thought this was odd because the food was not in a bag and every other time i had gotten take out from there the food came in Bags. I asked the lady if she was going to bag the food.  She went grabbed two bags and dropped them on the food and stated the bigger bag was for the pizzas. I then asked, do you expect me to bag my food?   And she replied that she doesn't have to bag food for grubhub customers and she then dropped my pizzas in the bag was holding open. She dropped the pizzas in sideways!    At this point i became irate, tossed all the food on the bar and demanded a refund.   The manager came over and stated that it was a misunderstanding. Wrong dude, even if i was a grubhub only customer, you don't treat customers like that.  Besides this, i just paid them directly for the food. After All i just dropped $130 on some pizzas and salads.  This place is run by clowns, the service is horrible.  Do not eat here.  I used to love the food and after they ruined this night i wont ever be able to eat here again.

Tanya A.,"San Diego, CA",52,155,290,4.0,3/1/2016,"Wonderful Spot at the mall for lunch/dinner + drinks! CPK @ Fashion Valley is located right by AMC and is a short walk from the top floor parking lot. They have 4 pick up parking spots reserved as well in the parking lot for guests picking up pizza! I've always had a great experience at this location. I have been here several times for lunch and several times on Friday after work for dinner. The wait is never more than 10 minutes and the servers are always responsive and take care of you very well. I usually have to ask for their complimentary bread, which is fine as i Imagine some people don't want to start their meal with bread and would rather wait for what they ordered. But the bread is delicious and super fresh, so I would recommend to ask for it :) I love their spicy chipotle chicken hand tossed pizza and i always add avacado to it. I also love the Tostada pizza which is a thin crust pizza - mexican style. It does not have traditional red sauce, but rather has a black bean base topped with lettuce, cheese, and chips. You can add chicken or another meat for an additional cost to this, but I usually stick to veggie.  The drinks are pretty great as well, good for the price and delicious.  A great tip for veggies/allergies: The CPK Website has an extremely detailed Allergen Menu which basically mentions EVERY single ingredient used in their dishes. So if you are strict vegetarian, or have any kind of allergies, you can easily lookup the dish you are interested in ordering - and it will tell you what it has. I know they have gluten free crust which attracts a lot of my co-workers, but I have never personally tried that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=40

I decided to have the avocado club egg rolls and my hubby had the chicken fettuccine. Within 10 minutes our meal arrived and this was a fully packed restaurant with patrons still waiting outside to be seated. My egg rolls were delicious. There were chunks of chicken, avocado, tomatoes, monterey jack and apple wood smoked bacon. Everything is better with bacon. This was so good my hubby kept taking bites out of my egg rolls.

My most recent visit was a weekday lunch stop however.  I typically visit at night or on a weekend so I hadn't had the opportunity to try their lunch duos before. It is a good deal!  You get to choose a soup and salad, or a soup or salad and a sandwich or pizza. I eat a LOT so I'm constant wondering if something like this will be enough food. It is perfect. I went with a pizza and soup combo. The BBQ chicken pizza is one of my favorites anyway and it was great as a personal size as well. The tortilla soup was creamy but delicious.

I order the same avocado rolls, barbecue chicken chopped salad and a margarita. My husband likes to change it up and get different pizzas. The fav is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza. He got a jalapeño margarita and ended up getting it again. When you find something on the menu that you like at CPK, there's no need to look at the menu anymore. Just wish the service was faster.

When we replied back by saying hey what's up his attitude changed. Man do I hate how people judge others by just looking at them. Well we were seated and our waitress brought us our menus no problem. Took our order no problem. Food took awhile I ordered the Thai chicken salad took 3 bites and that was all I could eat. The sauce or whatever was on my salad was very spicy for my taste. Waitress saw that I left my salad never bothered to ask me if their was something wrong with my food. My daughter  ordered a pepperoni pizza it tasted like card board. I finished my drink was never asked if I wanted a refilled. Worst customer service. I will never eat here again. Food taste like crap and their customer service was awful.

We were seated immediately in a comfy booth. Our server definitely had upselling on his mind, but it was a bit over the top and pushy in my opinion. Instead of asking if we wanted a cocktail, we were asked if we wanted this option or the other? It made me feel a bit awkward to say no. Other than that, our service was prompt and we were well taken care of.  The bread that came out was hot, fresh and served with a flavorful herbed olive oil. We had the original BBQ chopped salad and the club pizza. As I was looking over the menu, I noticed how similar so many of the items are on the menu. Avocado, bacon, chicken, and strawberries seem to be the overall theme here. My salad was tasty, but tasted very similar to my husbands pizza which was disappointing since we were sharing. The hot pizza with a pile of arugula and lettuce was an odd concept that we didn't love. Granted, we knew that when we ordered it..it just sounded better than it was.

Akava K.,"El Cajon, CA",82,46,303,4.0,11/18/2016,This is your high end Pizza place. I went there with my friend that is also a vet  on Veterans Day for the free food that they had. No lie love free food and they have good food and even gluten free. Now our hostess was grate even though we were there for the free food she was there just the same as if we were paying. Now the wait was a bit however for free food there will always be a wait. However they were fast at cleaning tables and getting people seated. Now if you want a good hostess look at pic and get her she is grate love her. Let's get to the food. We got gluten free pizza now most are ok even BJs is not that good but I like to stay gluten free as much As I can. To my surprise when I took a bit of it it was really good. I guess that is what you expect form a high end place. They even had BJs beat by a miles on that one to my surprise. Agin the hostess came back to see how every thing was going serval times filled my water up because I don't drink soda bad for you at meal time by the way. Now this one of those places you think cost a bit of a pizza so you don't really look at it that hard because you spend good money and not that good it just like all the others you get mad at your self. Now when they offer free food you go and check it out. By the why they take care of us  vets love them for that. Now that is a place I did not go last year on Veterans Day I should kick my self because I though it was just like the rest and went to BJs well now I know better. I have to say they have a nice gluten free menu and there real real good in services better the BJs and nicer for the most part there real about being nice not like BJs were it's just s fake smile. Now our hostess had a grate smile and to was real for her  heart. That is what makes a good hostess and I know she was tired form the long day but that smile was still there and it was real. That is a place you go to enjoy your self and be around real people that care for there jobs even that manger was grate. You see I use my credit cards and don't carry cash however I wanted to leave her a tip come to find out she just stated there not to long ago so the manger help her out so I could giver her a tip because remember free food so they did not charge me but he did a good one showed her how to get a tip from my card that was nice. By the way she was one I tipped 25% my average tip is 10% she was that good to us and always had that smile. she earned it every dime.

This location in general needs a remodel.  It's in the nicest most upscale mall in SD where they now offer seasons 52, true foods, pf changs and many other great places around the same price with a much nicer look and feel to them.  The bathrooms were really dark, the tables are older and it's just not a fashion valley mall type of feeling.  I understand it's better than eating in the good court and it's next to the movie theater but all the other restaurants are no further of a walking distance.  The only positive I can say for yesterday's lunch was that they have improved their bread and it's truly delicious.  They're old bread was just plain and the butter was hard as it had just come out of the fridge but the new bread is warm, soft and it comes with a really good olive oil and seasoning dip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=80

Although the patio tables were open, the inside dining room was bustling and the bar seats were all taken. TVs were playing sports highlights. Service was pleasant and cordial.

The California Veggie pizza is a veritable cornucopia of garden fresh ingredients: baby broccoli, Cremini mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, eggplant, and red onions. I added goat cheese and it was great. The Mediterranean salad is delicious as well: crisp greens, diced tomatoes, sliced olives, red onion, chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans), and feta crumble.

Their cheese is great, and really ruined my dinner since I was craving THAT. Second time I ordered, they remembered this delicious cheese. But they forgot my cheese & red pepper packets (I asked for these packets, twice, to clarify they were different from the fresh cheese). They also didn't give me their ""homemade"" whipped cream on the two key lime pies I ordered. Another craving they didn't satisfy. I had to stop by a grocery store on the way home to get some whipped cream. Not the same. Couldn't even finish the pie as it's in my fridge now, two days later. I clarified with the take out order taker, twice, that I just signed up for their rewards program online and would like to use their $10 off $40 order. When I called at curbside, I confirmed my total. They did not apply my coupon. But the girl added it on quickly. The girl that brought out the food was very nice so that made me not FURIOUS about all this. Missing condiments and all. Sad.

When I told the busser, he yanked the plates from my hand and had our server bring less disgusting, yet still-dirty plates. I wiped mine down before use. No one acknowledged the issue, they all played it down. The pizza was mediocre. I left feeling hungry after having four slices. The crust was unremarkable, better than stale crackers, I guess. The mozzarella had nice flavor, but the texture was too chewy. Total lack of sauce, prepare for cottonmouth if you choose to dine here. The toppings were scarce and an afterthought.

Our waiter Alex did not give his full 100% customer service to my family and I. As I kept seeing him going to all his other tables and being really attentive with them. Most of his table were white folks. At that point I felt discriminated only because I am Mexican, I don't deserve good customer service? I wasn't eating for free I paid just how every other person does for their meal. I understand it was Mother's Day but still not an excuse to give poor customer service.

We went together several years ago and ordered a pizza for the both of us and customized it to half pepperoni and half pineapple. The taste was great but we both came down with food poisoning shortly thereafter. Without getting into too much detail, we both were waking up hourly in the night having to go to the bathroom while our bodies ""rejected"" the pizza we ate. I've had food poisoning before but never this bad. Unfortunately, we will NEVER return to this location due to the horrible experience we had after the meal. The only reason I don't give it one star is because we actually remember the pizza tasting pretty decent and the setting and service wasn't anything to criticize.

This place is located on the second level of the Fashion Valley Mall next to the foodcourt and across from the AMC Theater. They have an outdoor patio for dining and a bar inside. I've been here a few times. Each visit is a different experience. This past visit was about an hour or so before closing on New Year's Eve with my friend. After doing some well deserved shopping for ourselves after Christmas, we decided to dine here. There was no wait, so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly. She also gave me a compliment on liking my Star Wars hat. Since we were famished, we already knew what we wanted to order. She took our drink orders first. I tried their Mango flavored iced tea. It was very sweet. As I was getting ready to separate our bread plate to give to my friend, I noticed that our plates had crumbs on it. I didn't know where our server went, so we got the attention of one of the male server's. He was working in the front host area. We asked for new plates. As he took our plates away, he said he will be back with new plates. He didn't return. When our server delivered our bread, I told her about the plates. She came back with freshly washed plates that were nice and warm. We ordered their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings as an  appetizer and the Wild Mushroom Pizza with Wheat  Whole Grain Crust. The dumplings were steamed to perfection with popping flavors of ginger. It was really yummy! The Wild Mushroom Pizza was also very tasty! We shared the appetizer and the pizza.

Lisa H.,"San Diego, CA",72,103,17,5.0,6/1/2013,"I am addicted to the chicken piccata. I really don't know what else to say. That tangy lemon, those flavorful little capers, the tenderness of the chicken, the pastaness of the pasta. Seriously, best chicken piccata. ever.  And the tequila lime chicken pasta is also pretty good, but nothing compares to my chicken piccata. It's like it just makes your dopamine shoot through the roof and turns unsuspecting people such as myself into full blown piccata addicts. And if you want to make it a full meal: Tiramisu - also amazing. House side salad - again, also amazing.  If you order ahead by phone, they remember you, because I guess your past orders come up on their computer. They always ask me if I will be ordering the chicken piccata because they know I am a chicken piccata addict. And they don't tell me that I have a problem or judge me or anything for it. They just ask if I would like to pick that up at their curbside service, and whether I would like their insanely good bread and utensils. And then I say, ""yes & yes.""

I don't smoke but I was scared that if a cigarette was lit, we're all gonna go up in flames lol. Afterall I decided to stay because I was tired of searching for places to eat at this mall and I was very hungry. As soon as I was seated, I got hit in the face with a strong smell of gym feet!! I mean it smelled like I walked into a cloud of farts. I'm guessing because they sat us next to the bathrooms. On the other hand... I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta. It was delicious! Spicy tomato sauce, luguini noodles, and Cajun chicken with a Coors Light on the side. The manager on duty suggested I try some new Orange County brewed beer called Devils Stone or something weird and that was the worst alcoholic beverage I've ever tasted. Overall, the food was great.

Jenny V.,"San Diego, CA",8,187,4,3.0,5/15/2013,"FOOD Good. 4 stars. Tasty SERVICE AT PICK UP/TO GO Terrible. Slow and incompetent staff. Negative stars. Unprofessional. I think I saw my cashier eat someone Else's order. If not someone Else's order, he was eating while not helping me. He ducked down into the fridge below the cash register, opened up a container and shoved something in his mouth. Then he just stood there chewing his food. He was actually supposed to get more information about a food item. He was literally in the middle of taking my order. I was literally face to face with him, waiting for him to finish his food. I didn't say anything, because in my head he was diabetic and going to go into shock if he did not eat at that moment. But realistically, I think he was disrespectfully and disgustingly eating someone Else's food, in the middle of taking my order and disrespecting me. I am not huge into needing to be respected, but this was beyond just being ""unprofessional"". What other things could this staff person be doing, that he shouldn't be doing at this restaurant. MANAGEMENT  Good. 4 stars. Professional. Comped my food without me asking. But, may need to consider incompetent staff's interactions with guests, and how this can impact customer's views of the company, in particular CPK Fashion Valley.

Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",83,49,9,2.0,2/19/2013,"Went to CPK for a birthday celebration. I was pretty satisfied with the food and drink, but the environment and service were lacking a lot of luster. PROS: Will do separate checks for a large group, Food was good (4 out of 5), the roasted veggie salad was a nice alternative to boring, plain, or fatty salads you usually find at restaurants these days.  CONS: Service was inconsistent, we got our food after the rest of our party was basically done eating theirs. Also, it's in a mall (which I try to avoid).  And it was crowded and we were sat late, even with reservations.  --------------------------------- DRINK:  I was in the mood for a beer, but there weren't any great selections - I think they had three beers on tap; Red Trolley was one, but none of them made me even a little excited.  The birthday guest's drink of choice is always a Long Island Iced Tea, so I had one of those as well.  Always a good choice if you think a corporate place isn't going to pour the drinks well, because it's pretty much all alcohol.  It was a decent drink, though the bartender didn't add enough ice so she topped it off with coke (it's supposed to be the smallest of splashes).  But, at $8, it was a good choice (I was honestly expecting $10 or $12). GROUPS: Even though we had reservations at 7:00 for 8, we weren't seated until 7:30. The upside of going to this place as a group is that they'll do separate checks, so you don't have to split the bill at the end.  The downside is that they still charged us the group rate for gratuity (18%).  I typically tip 18-20% for good and great service, but I didn't want to give them an 18% tip after that visit. FOOD: The food was good, Shawn got the Carnitas & Habanero pizza, and I had the roasted veggie half salad.  A half salad is just right for the standard person (girl) - get a full salad if you plan on sharing with someone.  The roasted veggies were done well - eggplant, peppers, artichoke hearts - and also avocado and a few other things.  Pretty tasty!  Shawn said the pizza was good too.  He and his brother love spicy food, and the pizza came with a habanero salsa/dipping sauce, which they said was pretty good (and actually on the spicy side.) SERVICE: The biggest negative of the night was that all the food came out for everyone else in our group, and Shawn Michael and I did not receive our food.  The server came back around and apologized to us, said there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that it was all her fault, and that our food would be out soon.  My salad was delivered at about the point when everyone else was halfway through their food, and Shawn's pizza came after everyone else had finished their meals (and I was nearly done with my salad).  We're pretty patient people, and recognize that mistakes are made, and for the most part are pretty forgiving.  The food was still good; he enjoyed his pizza and I my salad, but when a server admits that it was totally their fault, that they messed the order up, I expect the best approach is to take a portion of the price off the bill, or comp a drink or bring a free appetizer or something.  Shawn and I were both surprised when our check came and it was still full priced (and had the mandatory 18% gratuity included).   We weren't expecting it for free, because we still benefited from eating and enjoying the meal, but the server should account for the inconvenience and the inaccuracy of their service.  For Shawn's sake I wanted to say something, or at least tip a little bit less, but he didn't want to make it into a big deal so we ended up just paying the bill and leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280
Scott R.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,5,2.0,2/27/2015,"Stopped in to have a quick lunch.  While waiting for them to open, I browsed the menu outside on the wall. I picked the Italian deli sandwich for my lunch. Was seated by the very courteous staff and browsed the menu I was handed. That sandwich was not on their menu.  I walked out with my server ""Calvin"" to show him the menu error and he pointed it out to the manager.  They did offer to attempt to make the sandwich for me, but I didn't want to be a problem.  So I went with my second choice, the Italian chopped salad which they charge ~ $15 for.  When I got it I was shocked at the lack of meat.  They probably had about three slices of salami cut into strips and about a half of a cup of cubed turkey meat.  I polished the ""full"" sized salad in not time and could of had another.  I will admit that it did taste very good, but not worth the price.  I'd peg this as 2x too expensive and will not get again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280
Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,557,,2.0,5/6/2010,"This review is my second review of a CPK location, however, very little has changed since my original review of a LA location. This location is at the Mission Valley mall area.  The first and most important thing to remember about ordering pizza from this chain is that you have to specifically request thin crust. If you don't, then without exception, I have had bad pizza here with thick, undercooked crust. When you request thin crust, they simply take the original crust and press it a second time, giving you a larger diameter pizza, probably with more toppings.  This chain has some interesting sounding pizzas but for the most part, they have taken conventional dinner entrees and just put them on a pizza.  The conventional cheese pizza that I had here recently was worse than the last time I tried it, with a more generic and bland mozzarella and a more generic and bland tomato sauce. All I can think regarding this terrible pizza was that they must have geared this pizza to children and kept it horribly bland to avoid offending any picky youngsters.  Again, the best pizza that they served was their salad based pizza (both with and without the salad on top). This pizza is a white or sauce less pizza with more interesting cheeses and some more flavorful spices. The crust is the same on all of the pizzas and, when thin enough, is mildly flavorful, raised with some elasticity.  The salad with Parmesan shavings and chopped tomatoes that comes on the salad pizza is surprisingly good both on its own and with the pizza. It consistently has a fresh lettuce and flavorful dressing as well as surprisingly abundant freshly shaved Parmesan cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280

If someone in my group would suggest it I would agree to go. The time I've been here the service was good & so was the food, but there is nothing memorable of this place. So basically, even when I liked the Thai salad & the chipotle chicken pizza, the only time I would go back is if I'm hungry & I have the place standing right in front of me. Is just doesn't stand out for me, for the price there are better places for pizza.

She was friendly and when we told her we were in a hurry to make a movie she made sure our food was to our table as fast as possible.  Another positive- my tortilla spring rolls tasted excellent.  The negatives: The hostess was a tool. I gave her my name, she said it would be a 10-15 minute wait. I told her I would be at the bar. 20 minutes of me looking around, waiting to be called go by and I finish a glass of wine. I walk back to the hostess stand and she says she called my name a long time ago.  me: I told you i would be at the bar  hostess: i went over there and called your name a few times  me: really? i was sitting there watching the entire time  hostess: maybe i didn't call it loud enough  ya think? i think you didn't even walk over there at all, and you are a LIAR! I would have seen you. you would have seen me. in fact, I was LOOKING for you the entire time to come get me so I wouldn't have to listen to the annoying dbag talking SUPER loud to his friend about how he got kicked out of a club in Vegas, for losing a fight to a girl.

Name Withheld K.,"San Diego, CA",4,187,155,2.0,10/18/2015,"I have been to this location twice now, and have decided that this particular CPK doesn't have as good of food or service as the other CPKs that I've been to. Also, on both of my visits to this location there was an issue with my food AND the service was weird. On the first visit, the restaurant was pretty dead, and somehow, there was an avocado pit in my shrimp caesar salad - odd considering that there's no avocado in caesar salad. On this visit, our server was nice, but kind of over the top and I don't feel that he was as professional as he should have been. Although, I did appreciate that he at least paid attention to me and my husband so that was no big deal. Overall, that experience was about on par/slightly less than what I have come to expect at California Pizza Kitchen, but I was just stoked to be at the mall and not have to eat fast food. On the second visit, the restaurant was super busy, but my husband and I had a gift card from his parents that we wanted to use so we waited 25 minutes and were seated in the smallest, most in the way table that they had. Again, no big deal, they were busy & I was hungry, so whatever. (My husband and I are noticing a trend where we get the worst tables available no matter what.......wtf!!)  On this visit, our food had some issues but I didn't have it in me to complain right off the bat....To sum it up, the grilled shrimp in my caesar salad was cold (it's supposed to be grilled, and warm), and there were itty bitty bits of cold grilled chicken in my salad. I didn't complain about the salad, but looking back, I totally should have. However, what I did complain about was the fried mac & cheese bites. I took a bite of one and it was extremely cold in the middle. It was so cold and so nasty that I had to spit it out, and I can't really remember the last time that I did that. On this visit, our server was kind of a douche and I felt like he purposely ignored me and my husband. He was constantly checking on the table across from ours, but kept his back to us the whole time. He would literally be standing with his ass in my husbands face and we would try to get his attention but he was in such a hurry/not listening/not looking in our direction that we spent way, WAY, too long trying to get his attention. We finally gave up on getting his attention and flagged down whoever, whenever because we were sick of waiting for him. Now that I am taking the time to write all this down, the second visit was definitely worse than the first, and I didn't really enjoy my meal, or the experience there..... After thinking about it a bit, I feel genuinely ripped off. I thought the whole point of going to a chain restaurant was consistency? What's up CPK @ Fashion Valley? Things aren't looking so hot for you guys right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100
Trang N.,"San Diego, CA",700,233,375,5.0,11/1/2014,"To be honest I thought this was a pizza place but they actually have a variety of foods from bomb salads, to pastas, and so much more all at an affordable price!  Located at fashion valley mall , by the food court!  Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess who sat us right away. Our server mike is awesome, attentive and super friendly! He refilled our waters twice without us having to ask, and he provided us with such great service and always kept checking up on us as well as asking how the food is and how everything's going every now and then .  Great personality. When you have delicious dishes as well as a really good service - your whole dining experience is 100x better. We ordered pasta for our son which came with apple juice. The kids pasta I must admit  is large enough for an adult!  We also ordered the jambalaya fettuccine pasta and O M G if you've never tried it I highly recommend it! It consists of chicken, shrimp, and crawfish with sausage & ham with spicy Cajun sauce (it's not spicy where you can't eat it). This is large enough to share between two people, but of course if you both are hungry I would definitely order another dish to share as well.  We also ordered the California Cobb salad which was really delicious for a salad! This salad has smoked bacon(yum!) , eggs, basil, herb with a choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Another dish that we ordered which was really bomb is Hawaiian pizza on crispy thin crust - gluten free. Crispy and fresh , California pizza kitchen pizzas really don't disappoint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100

We told him what it stood for and he responded... ""I don't know what the f*** that is"" I have never had a waiter use that language. Very unprofessional.

Cindy D.,"San Diego, CA",42,317,1,5.0,12/10/2014,"Alright, alright, I know what you're thinking..... ""5 stars for a chain restaurant?"". Hear me out on this one: The reason I found myself at CPK on a Thursday night was because my aunt was hosting a fundraiser. CPK agreed to donate 20% of our bill to the Cheetah Conservation Fund. Twenty percent is a nice chunk- I appreciated they were so generous with their percentage.  Onto the food:  My date (a.k.a. my Mom) and I agreed to split a half salad. She picked the Italian Chopped salad. Would not have been my first choice because I'm not a huge fan of salami, but man, I'm glad I let her pick. The salad was great! The salami wasn't overpowering. The salad-to-dressing ratio was on point. I guess Mom always does know best. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine great! I usually give restaurants a ""4"" if I liked the food, and a ""5"" if I consider it ""unforgettable."" The dish had a lot of different flavors put together. I'd definitely get this again. On top of it all- our server was super friendly and not too ""sale-sy."" When he picked up on the fact that we weren't super hungry, he told us to just let him know if we wanted to look at dessert menus. He didn't bring them and try and guilt us into ordering more, which I really appreciated. Overall, CPK exceeded my expectations.

It was a Friday at about 3pm, so of course it was packed, but we were seated, orders taken, and served in a good amount of time. Servers were really great, and definetly earned the tip.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza. it's so great! The pizzas on their menu are medium-sized, perfect for sharing -- or not :) A couple of pizzas, and a beer and another drink, and a soup, total was a bit over $40. I'd say that's a pretty resonable price, considering how much food we got. I love this place and cannot wait to go back.  And I 100000% reccomend their deserts.

Mikhail R.,"San Diego, CA",234,25,41,4.0,11/24/2015,"I have never been to a California Pizza Kitchen, so I was very excited to make a first visit. There are two, near where I live, so I decided to go to the Fashion Valley location because I was just leaving campus, and it was the closer option. I was given a $50 gift card to CPK, so I came in one day after a long day at school. Upon my arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar by the host. He was friendly, and gave me the option to sit at a table, but since I was all by myself, I chose the latter. I looked at the menu before I was approached by a waiter, named Renee. She took my drink order first, and I got the Caribbean Sangria, and a glass of water. I came in around noon, and the lunch special was still on so I took advantage of that.  She came back with my drinks and apologized for not having pineapple in my drinks, and I laughed and told her it was perfectly fine. She came back a couple minutes later with a plate of chopped pineapples. It was a simple gesture, but all the more appreciated. The sangria was really really delicious. I've had my fair share of sangrias, but that drink alone could keep me coming back. So with that, my first impression was already off to a great start. She took my food order, and I got the lunch special with a caesar salad and their specialty, bbq chicken pizza. After that, Renee gave me some bread while I waited, and sipped on my sangria. My food came out and the salad was okay. Can't really blame them because all caesar salads that I've had taste the same, HAHAHA! Anywho, their pizza was really good. Loved the savory and smoky flavors.  Their food was very satisfactory, but the service I received from Renee was really really great. She kept conversation with me, kept checking back, did little things here and there that I didn't ask her to do, but she did anyways. Being self-efficient is definitely key to being a great employee, and Renee was outstanding. Kudos to her, and I'll definitely be making more trips back if service there is as good as hers :) Great first impression, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100

In shocked we looked at each other and continued to also asked to sit in the patio but they didn't want to seat us outside either. The hostess then saw the manager walk by and asked her and the manager even said the same thing. One difference is that she did tell them to seat is outside but had us seated at different tables. They didn't even set the tables for us to be seated together. We have never been to a CPK and had this problem before.  ONE STAR  for the hostess and the manager.

I told her we had called in ahead of time and she seemed to be in disbelief. At first, she said there was no record of my calling in. But then I noticed my name on the wait list. When I pointed this out to her, she seemed skeptical, stating, ""This doesn't look like a call in."" Truly bizarre reaction and accusation. Do you not want us to patronize your mediocre restaurant? We waited quite a while after that point. Nearly 50 minutes after my call, the portly hostess calls us. She notices we have a small child and then berates us in front many other guests with words to the effect of the following: ""You should have told me you had a child. Now you will have to wait longer. A child counts as a person."" Gee whiz, what a complete failure of customer service and professionalism. At last, the portly waitress seats us but only after 25 minutes beyond the wait we were promised. On the bright side, the food was decent and the server was much more friendly and on top of things.

The peppers gave a hint of spice and sweetness. They also give you a lime which you can squeeze into the pasta giving it a sour taste. Doesn't that sound delicious?

Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",616,649,571,5.0,4/4/2015,"Easily my favorite restaurant chain! Growing up, my mom and I used to go to CPK every Saturday night. Needless to say, a part of my childhood revolves around CPK (as strange as that sounds). I've grown up with the menu and watched it evolve with changes in soups, the addition of the small plates menu and the increase in gluten free items. Pretty much anything you eat here is delicious, but here are a few of my absolute favorites. The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad- This one is a classic. The blend of BBQ sauce and ranch over a mix of lettuce, tomatoes, corn, black beans and TORTILLA CHIPS is delicious! I'm not a huge meat eater so I like to substitute avocado for chicken. The California Club Sandwich-It has bacon in it. Enough said. It also comes with a soup or salad, so I always choose the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley to add on. Thai Chicken Pizza- There was a time when they took this off the menu, but it's back and it's got such a unique flavor. It's a must try! Tostada Pizza- It's like a Mexican style salad on your pizza. The only thing is that it doesn't keep very well, so you need to finish the whole thing at the restaurant. Great for sharing! Chocolate Souflle Cake-Yes, the red velvet is to die for and the butter cake melts in your mouth, but the chocolate souflle cake will forever be the greatest dessert to every grace the pages of the CPK dessert menu. It's so chocolatey and gooey. If you don't get it with ice cream, you're doing it wrong. Clearly, I'm a CPK nut but I love this place.

I really appreciate when a server can just scan your table or your body language and know immediately what you need without words. I was brought a second set of drinks without having to ask and it's those small little gestures that bring satisfaction during a dine in. The waitress showed proper etiquette the whole time and made sure we were comfortable throughout our whole session and I can say with confidence that the food was spectacular. Now while the menu may seem slightly pricey, it is well worth the extra cash due to having a more premium taste.

Many of their other dishes are pretty damn good too...especially since they are a chain.  Not a fan of ranch dressing, but theirs....I seem to like it since they also drizzle BBQ sauce on top of the salad and the two together is very tasty.  Was bummed when I came back in a couple of years ago and the wonderful french bread they served was gone. In it's place was a non crusty bread I hated. I think that soured me on coming back.  Well, I guess I forgot about the bread and was just craving that salad and came back in last week. Lo and behold, they got an even better crusty bread than they originally had! Yay! And served with olive oil for dipping, Mediterranean style.  And that BBQ Chicken salad is just as good as it ever was. Small one is plenty if by yourself and not sharing.

Our waitress was very nice, asked if we were ready to order twice, but were not ready...then she disappeared. After some time, she came back and apologized for the wait. She said she was getting reviewed by the big managers that were in town. Really? Giving employee reviews during the dinner rush while you already started to wait on customers? That was strange. Sure enough, noticed 3 other servers, either at tables inside the restaurant or on the patio getting reviews. Little tacky I thought. Don't you have a back office or something? Pizzas were good, just not as amazing or ""wow"" as I had remembered. Lettuce wrap appetizer was good. Getting Rick Rolled inside the restaurant...classic. They did have a (what I thought was new) was a try a new pizza guarantee. Try something new and if you don't like it, they will make your ""old stand by favorite"" for free. Thought that was nice, although I'd like to think most places would do that, they just don't advertise it. I am torn on rushing back for another go at dinner.

Other then the ones Ive gone to many times, the others all just blend in together because of how consistent they are.  This one stands out as being awful Please spend the extra few bucks and wait if you have to and just go to Cheesecake Factory downstairs (which is pretty on par with any others youve been to) Service at this CPK was pretty bad, my glass was stained, they filled up my soft drink half way, it looked empty, the salad that I usually get looked unfresh, and it smelled like a homeless person where I was sitting.  I love CPK but would never go back to this one.  I pray that I just went on a horrible day, but nothing about how the staff acted made it seem out of the ordinary.

Miki L.,"Long Beach, CA",274,155,774,2.0,9/28/2010,"Normally, I am a huge fan of CPK, but this location is pretty poor quality!  After having a huge event at the Hard Rock the night before, my friend decided to celebrate the day of her actual birthday with a more mellow dinner at CPK. Four of the six members of our party arrived at 7:30 and we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress took about hmmm... 8 minutes or so to come over, introduce herself and get our drink orders... pretty simple... just water. It was another 8 minutes or so before the water came. We told her we would wait for a few minutes to see if the other members of our party would arrive before we ordered anything. In the meantime I stepped outside, made a quick call to my beau and realized we shouldn't wait to order our food. After I returned it was another 10 minutes or so before the waitress returned to our table, despite having visited the table next to ours about 5 times (no joke)... our menus were closed and we were staring at her, which typically is a sign that someone is ready to order. When she finally arrived we ordered the Mediterranean small plate as an appetizer for 3 people & requested the bread be brought out as well. I wish she would have mentioned that its definitely too small to share for 3 people, because when the food arrived no less than 15 minutes later it was like a bite of pita, salad & hummus for each of us. While we were munching away, our waitress came over to us and let us know that she would no longer be taking care of our table for the evening and that a second waitress would be helping us. This was great since we were already annoyed that she had been soooo ridiculously slow. The second waitress took the order from 3 members of our party, and I waited till my beau and his friend arrived about 10 minutes later.  When the guys arrived, the food was still not out (the salad & soup appetizers), so we put in our orders with the waitress and asked for a refill on the bread. She told us, Im sorry I believe we are out, she took a quick peek at the kitchen area and to her surprise stated, ""oh, i guess we got some more."" First off, are you serious? CPK ran out of bread?? When it arrived, it was cold.. I mean not room temperature like it normally is, but cold to the touch.. like frozen. We told our waitress and she exclaimed ""It always comes cold, if you want it toasted then you needed to ask prior."" After asking her to touch the bread she realized the kitchen must have taken it from the freezer or the fridge before cutting it and sending it out. She brought the bread back to the kitchen to be toasted and it arrived about 10 minutes later. The food was nothing to be discussed as it tasted exactly the same as I have had a dozen times before. At the end of our meal the waitress asked if anyone was interested in dessert. I felt sort of pressured as she asked like 10 times... luckily, she did bring my friend, the birthday girl, an ice cream sundae, but she didn't even bother to join in as we sung happy birthday to her.  Oddly, I ate at the Temecula CPK the night prior to this incident, and I can say that this was the poorest and slowest service, by multiple waitresses, that I have ever received at a CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=320

Chris S.,"San Diego, CA",19,56,,5.0,6/18/2015,"Had dinner here last night with friends before catching a movie next-door and we were seated immediately and greeted by a pleasant and very professional young man named Walter. We explained that we had a little bit of a time problem and were going to see a movie next-door and he indicated that they sold tickets in the restaurant to the movie theater for only eight dollars which is an incredible bargain that I did not know about! Of course we said yes and all of our food came out in a very timely and professional fashion. All was great until the main course came, and my friend bit into the pizza and found an alien piece of what initially appeared to be glass but was just a hard piece of clear plastic. Our server, Walter, handled it very professionally and immediately a lovely female manager was tableside and took care of the issue in the most professional manner I can imagine! She offered to replace the pizza which we declined, and offered us free dessert which we accepted, and when the bill came, the manager had deducted much more than was necessary or expected which elevates the service level of this restaurant to pretty much amazing! I have been in the restaurant business for 35 years and I was exceptionally impressed by the way that this whole and generally rather minor problem was handled with utmost efficiency and grace! The food over all is quite satisfactory to exceptional, and the prices are far more fair than the adjacent and overrated and always packed cheesecake factory. I recommend this place to anyone for a fair price and very good meal with great service and plenty of selection! Service is great and management is off the charts amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=200
Evonne L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",137,499,,1.0,5/31/2010,"Dear CPK,  What was with the BIG ASS BUG that was in my pizza? Not cool!!! I'm tryng to be reasonable here in recognizing that sometimes there are flies or gnats inside any restaurant, but we all know that was no fly. Whatever it was had an inch long span, complete with long antennae, 6 stringy legs, a bloated thorax, and impressive triangular wings.  And what's with that thing being at the BOTTOM of the pear and gorgonzola pizza? I was pushing that shit around like it was a piece of curled up lettuce the whole time! It wasn't  until I was feebly trying to  ""unroll"" the ""piece of lettuce"" to put on a piece of pizza crust, and suddenly realized it was not a lettuce leaf...it was a large insect lightly covered in dressing and slightly curled up from the heat of the pizza. Good to know I ate nearly all the pizza and shared a buncha pieces of it with 3 of my friends before this wonderful discovery. I hope that little guy didn't have a friend that I am already digesting. That's gotta be a violation of some health and safety code.  Anyway, it was cool that the manager did the best that she could after seeing the sickening sight. She gave a long apology (speculating that the large bug came from outside due to a produce order, but not from inside of the CPK restaurant and emphasizing that "" this never happens"").  It's just a shame that it did happen and even if the bug came from Iraq, the bottom line is it doesn't belong on a pizza. Still, the manager offered to comp 1/2 of the meal. She also offered us dessert to make up for our little friend, but unfortuantely no one was really in the mood to eat anymore food after seeing (and tasting) such a sight. When asked what else CPK could do for us, we suggested comping us a drink but apparently, it's against CPK policy to comp alcoholic beverages. Ironic because at that point, you'd probably need a drink to forget you were chowing down on bug-pizza.  Additionally, the wait for this CPK is notoriously long and service is usually less than amazing because it's so busy. We waited a long time to get a response from the staff for the bug and then an even longer time to get our checks (triple slap in the face). I know no one maliciously intended the bug to be in the pizza, and the manager and waitress seemed like nice people. However, that experience was just nasty, and I don't think I'd ever come back.  PS- I am further embarassed that I was the one who suggested you to my friends and saddened that you will be my first 1 star review on Yelp!

The quality of CPK is decent though you can get better bang for your buck elsewhere on pizza.  If you're looking to splurge, have at it!  This go around my friend and I split a bbq chicken pizza (yum!) and their fried mac and cheese appetizer (you get 4 pieces).  They were kinda dry and there wasn't a lot of cheese sauce so it was more like pasta coated in bread crumbs and fried.  Wouldn't get them again without asking for a little more cheese (it's in the name, right? So shouldn't there be more of the good stuff?).  I'm cheap when it comes to eating out (who isn't on a budget these days) and my friend and I were able to split a pizza (6 small slices) and app and be fine while walking out the door paying about $12/per person - not the cheapest but not breaking the bank either. I was UBER excited to see my newest favorite vodka on the menu (Veev, which is an acai vodka - to die for!).  So of course I had to have their Strawberry basil martini ($8) and for a buck more I decided to add the extra shot of vodka and it was well worth the price.  I will absolutely get this drink again and will be making it at home as well!!  Thanks for the great drink idea CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=200

The location is sunny and airy and they have a nice patio area (with a view of the parking structure, I might add, but at least it's quiet on that end of the mall). Plus, all the staff members I've encountered have been friendly and genuine!  Despite being a chain restaurant, CPK has a lot of tasty (and healthy!) options to choose from. Although their delicious pizzas can be tempting, their salads are equally good and filling. I really like coming here for lunches and light dinners! I recommend eating here instead of the alarmingly overpriced Cheesecake factory that's also present in the mall. The food comes out pretty quickly, their prices are totally within reason, and they have a super-wide selection of different meals to choose from.

I'm sorry, but it just does. Ive been eating here forever. When I lived in Nyc, I lamely ate there every saturday night before I went to work. And this location, was just as good, food wise.  The pizza, so amazing. they brought back my favorite, the garlic chicken pizza (YES!) and I love the pear Gorgonzola also. oh and the thai.....my bf likes the works, thin crust.  what surprises me , is the other foods on the menu are very very good. my picks are, The chicken ceaser salad, quinoa and asparagus salad add chicken , fish tacos (they are good trust me) , the pork tacos (a little spicy) and the chips and salsa. the salsa is good! the hummus app is good,, on the healthy menu the salmon and the chicken chimichurri   are delicious and light., and lastly pretty much every salad.  what I didn't like, the avocado rolls (they taste like bacon, and it should mention they have that in there, vegetarians beware of this-my brother wasn't happy with that surprise) , the mac and cheese bites (fried greasy mess of cheese) and the pasta isn't anything spectacular , actually get anything but the pastas.... So the food- LOVE. I'd give 5 stars if I liked the location better. it's in a mall so parking sucks, and it's by a movie theatre so its going to be crowded and it's a family place so often times your seated by a family of 6 with kids yelling and parents who look like they just stopped caring and need a xanax so they just let them cry and throw crayons . those things can be avoided if you don't come on  weekend nights and try to stay away from prime dinner times (7-8 p.m) during the week.  also the place needed to be swept, we had to switch tables b/c they sat us at an obviously dirty table. and it was really cold in there.  Basically come for the food- because it IS good, try to sit at a table tucked away from booths, or at the bar. oh , 1 more thing ( i have come here so much I knew the bartender he told me this....) the drinks aren't that strong. it's a lot of juice. i wouldn't spend the 10 bucks on a drink with 1.5 ounces of cheap alcohol and 90% sugar and juice. there wine selection is pretty solid too. not your usual cheap stuff, but actual decent wines (they carry dreaming tree) or try a wine flight. 3 little glasses of white or red. a neat way to try different things. nothing super fancy- like what you'd see at a wine bar, but seems like a step above what your usual chain restaurants carry. kendall jackson anyone?

Moira H.,"La Jolla, CA",77,137,,4.0,7/7/2014,"CPK is one of the best chain restaurants around. I think that their pizzas rival some upscale pizza eateries.

Mind as well order Dominos right? I tried the frozen CPK pizzas from Vons, but that does not do justice for the REAL and FRESH thing they serve. WOW, so many pizza options, I got the white mushroom pizza on a thin crust. So delicious. I had one and tried to tame myself afterwards. So rich and flavorful. If I ever go to italy, I will measure up how their pizza compares. That is how good it was. Next time, I think I won't get thin crust, because with the amount of cheese, I think it made the crust a little chewy and soggy. I like it crunchy, it wasn't able to hold my toppings.

Linh N.,"San Diego, CA",133,223,131,3.0,3/21/2010,"Surprisingly, today was my first time at CPK, even though I am a San Diego Native. I don't know... I just never had the urge to go there. Anyhow, finally at there for lunch today. At first glance at the menu, nothing really caught my eye and looked too appealing. I didn't want anything heavy and really wasn't in the mood for pizza. I opted for an appetizer and went with the avocado egg rolls.  The avocado egg rolls were pretty good. There wasn't a whole lot of avocado in it, so I'm surprised at the name on this dish. The outside was crispy which was yummy. My husband ordered some chicken pizza.... it looked alright... he said it was good, but I personally didn't try it. He did mention that Sammy's woodfired is better though.  My friend ordered some tequila pasta thing... now THAT was pretty darn good.  I thought the prices were on the high-average side. The restaurant was busy  and bustling. I didn't find anything too unique about the food itself.... so not sure that I would come back on my own suggestion.

S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,4.0,2/22/2011,"When I lived in San Diego and craved CPK, I ate at the restaurant off Nobel (off the 5 freeway). However, perusing through sales racks at the mall can make a guy hungry. Being that this is one of my favorite chains, I was introduced to this CPK at Fashion Valley Mall. It was kind of tucked away in a corner on the second story of this complex and thus I was hesitant to go in, primarily because I thought the quality of the food would be lower given the relatively poor location. WRONG!!! It's a chain. Chain's operate like assembly lines and thus the product, no matter the location, is generally the same (or at least very similar). For example, In-n-out burgers. I've ordered 3 at a time and they all tasted the same. I've eaten at 3 different In-n-out's and they've all tasted the same. Sorry for the tangent but I'm just trying to make a point. The food was the same: AWESOME!!! I've been here with a couple of friends and have actually tried something outside of my favorites (will be listed below). Sit back and enjoy the ride. Environment: Like I said before, this restaurant is on the smaller side and I anticipated not only a smaller dining area but a more claustrophobic experience. NOPE. The layout was different than other restaurants I've been to but the space between tables that allows for intimacy was still there. Not as many windows as it's sister restaurant closer to La Jolla but there was ample lighting. Probably not as much traffic in this restaurant given that there were fewer tables and thus fewer employees. Waiters/Waitresses: I remember coming here with a buddy of mine, a CPK virgin. I had talked up this restaurant because of the variety and my favorites. As soon as we sat down, he shouted ""I freaking love this place!"" I looked up from my menu and was just about to ask him which entree he was looking at only to find that his menu was still on the table, closed. He was admiring the people around us. More specifically, staring at the ladies at the neighboring tables. I HAD to take a look myself. Let me just say that he has good taste. My buddy probably didn't pick up the menu for another 10 minutes. Just people watching....including the waitresses. Need I say more? Food: I've copied an excerpt from a past posting and pasted it on the bottom of this review. On this particular day, I had the BBQ chicken pizza. Apparently, ""Our most popular pizza, introduced in our first restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1985. Barbecue sauce, smoked Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses, BBQ Chicken, sliced red onions and cilantro."" Sounds great right? It is. I don't quite understand it but BBQ sauce gets more spicy when you cook it. I LOVE SPICY FOOD! The chicken pieces are cooked well; not too dry, not raw. There's a perfect combination and ratio of onions and chicken which doesn't overpower the BBQ sauce. Instead, they work synergistically to create this wonderful flavor explosion in your mouth. I'm sorry for my painfully nerdy way of describing food but that's my forte. Recommendation: EAT! Where do I start? The bread is pretty good. Only problem is that the butter comes right out of the fridge and does not spread easily. Appetizers are terrific. Had several of them before but the favorite, by far, had to be the spinach artichoke dip. Perfect blend of cheese, spinach, and artichoke hearts. Creamy and tasty. With every bite of the dip, you feel some spinach get stuck between your teeth. But, because it's so perfectly prepared and cooked, one swipe of your tongue or finger and the situation resolves itself. Dang. Now I'm hungry, just thinking about it. Sometimes the chips are a little salty. If that's the case, ask for more bread and use the dip as a spread. Creative. I know. I've sampled different manifestations of this dish at multiple restaurants and not one can come as close to perfection as CPK has managed to do. For entrees, the favorites are california pizza (sweet and thin [but not sicilian-pizza-thin] crust, melted cheese, creamy mayonnaise-like sauce, fresh lettuce, crispy bits of  chopped bacon, and thick slices of avocado), thai chicken pizza, and chicken tequila fettucini (rich tequila flavor with hint of lime and cream. For all you alcoholics, you CANNOT have the tequila on the side!). Have tried others but we almost always order these. Only problem with the California pizza is that you can't really save it. Avocado does not do well overnight. Go ahead, prove me wrong. For dessert, I've tried the cranberry cheesecake. Basically, it's normal cheesecake with cranberry swirls and an Oreo crust. Wasn't bad. Remember, I don't normally do desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=300

I had ordered the strawberry lemonade and they have the best out there. It's perfectly balanced and just I heart it =) Along with that was my chicken lettuce wraps. I've never had a problem with them and it's very light, not too heavy like pastas which I wasn't feeling at the time.  The service was good but our waiter disappeared for some time. Other than that, I was pleased with the time we got in and out, but unfortunately, had to return to work to finish off the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=300

lori C.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,1,2.0,9/9/2011,"Everything was going great. We put in our order (two pizzas). It took a little longer than I expected but no worries at this point. Towards the middle of our meal we asked the waitress (Betty) for the check as we needed to get back to work. We waited, and waited, and waited...no check. Finally my husband had to leave and I stayed behind to settle the check. Finally after another 10mins our waitress shows up with the check stating she forgot about us. I open the bill and there is another persons visa check card and bill in the bill folder. As I was getting up to alert our waitress she realized what she had done and was at our table to correct her mistake. I had never seen her move so fast. Still no bill for me at this point. Finally my bill comes and I ask for a dessert to take home and a take home box for my unfinished pizza. Easy enough right? I had also requested to take home the salsa that came on the side. I even offered to pay for extra. No problem says Betty. She came back and had boxed up my pizza but said my piece cake was not ready yet. I examined the pizza,  no extra salsa..just what had been left on my plate. No bill again at this point because she had to now recalculate for the dessert. Needless to say after waiting another 5mins or so I had to get up and go to the front of the restaurant to get my bill. As I was doing so the cake in a box showed up. Unfortunately whoever decided to box the cake also put the sauce (which comes with the cake) on the cake instead of in a different container. Now my cake will be soggy unless I plan on eating it in the next 10mins which was not the case. Now I am once again waiting...this time for a new piece of cake. I am sorry to say this Betty but your waitressing skills need work and so does your sensitivity, or, lack there of, towards your customers. I usually tip at least 20%..not this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=340
Teej T.,"Urbana, IL",668,663,20,3.0,10/6/2007,"I have many mixed feelings about you, CPK. First off, if you were not a chain, I'd be more intrigued, because in a vaguely hip, annoyingly upscale way you do try to reinvent two cliches, California cuisine, and Chic Pizza Spots.  Unfortunately, you're a chain, so in the same way that Starbuck's originally had an interesting take on the coffee shop, your corporate touch has finessed all the originality out of the experience.  So boo on you. Now, secondly, your food is stylish, and the pizzas will be tasty, and the spinach artichoke dip will be wonderfully awesome, but it is all expensive, and far more than necessary.  While I feel racially awkward ordering the white pizza (Will Dad think I'm excluding him?  Will Mom think I'm trying to hard to blend with half the family?), it is delicious--and with added bacon, mushrooms, and alfredo sauce, I know I'm shortening my lifespan accordingly so I don't have to feel too uncomfortable.  However, should it really be around $15?  Nah. Your Oktoberfest beer was wonderful, and your peach/raspberry/whatever Torani syrup you have available-infused iced tea is lovely, but still pricey.  So you give again with flavour, and you take away with cost.  Oh CPK, when will you stop taunting me with your uneven array of tasty and costly? And finally, what makes you lose favour in my eyes, oh CPK, is the fact that you are located within that most bourgeois of malls south of UTC, Fashion Valley.  This also means that you are the Mecca for any near by high school.  This shouldn't be a problem, but if you are a high school teacher, it means a HIGH degree of pleasant but slightly awkward student/teacher conversations outside of school. Student: HEEEEEY!!!!! Teacher: Hi there! (pause) Student: So, it's um weird to see you outside of school. Teacher: Um...yeah, totally weird. Student: I don't know, I just thought all my teachers lived at school or whatever. Teacher: Er...well, um, ....I don't? Student: Yeah... Teacher: I have to ...um...be over here now. So, CPK is relatively tasty and edgy, but the edginess is dulled by corporate America, the tasty is blunted by the priceyness, and the location makes me feel occasionally uncomfortable. AND.......your lobby looks out over D'Lush. :::Shudder:::  I hate you, D'Lush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=340
Nadine N.,"Vancouver, Canada",186,724,295,2.0,5/6/2007,"I like CPK. I especially like the roasted eggplant pizza and the roasted vegetable salad...at other CPKs, not the one at Fashion Valley. Their roasted veggie salad sucked. The vegetables were burnt and/or flavorless. Don't they have some sort of corporate standard? Isn't that the whole point of chains? You go to any one and the food tastes the same regardless of where you are?  Service could use plenty of improvement too. The hostesses seemed indifferent to people who wanted to be put on the wait list.  If you have to eat at Fashion Valley, I would recommend that you check out the Nordstrom Cafe for better food and better service.

Vin F.,"San Diego, CA",125,138,2,3.0,12/7/2007,"I went there with K. after a movie at Fashion Valley, primarily because it was late, it was open, and K. said she was starving.  If I'm a snob about any food, it's probably pizza (I do realize that's somewhat oxymoronic).  But at 11pm in San Diego, it was that or Seven-Eleven. This chain just reeks of that corporate feel - it's just one step above a food court.  The pizza was actually not bad - we had the vegetarian, and the vegetables were very fresh, including the Japanese eggplant, which was an interesting addition.  It would have been a lot more interesting if it had been larger than an hors d'oeuvre, or at least as cheap as one.   We also ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, which had nicely flavored chicken lying, unfortunately, on something that resembled a compost pile.  I'm not quite sure when tossing a couple of mandarin orange slices into a pile of head lettuce suddenly qualified a salad as ""Chinese"" but somehow I doubt that this is what they're eating in Bejing. The problem with CPK isn't that it's bad, but that it's not.  It's another one of those overpriced, underachieving corporate entities that's just good enough to keep you from avoiding it, but you always leave with that vague sense of having been taken for a ride.  An expensive and unsatisfying one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=340

No one served us  or even offered us drinks. We were even waving other waiters and waitresses to get water but everyone walked right passed us as if we were not even there. We literally stared at our menus for a good 7-8 minutes watching everyone around us get serviced. Even people seated way after us were attended to and offered water.

The restaurants are clean and efficient but they're too bright and loud. I'll stick with the lower key places like Bronx. I think the Bronx employees would snicker at CPK too.

The hostess opens the door for you and BAM, your nostrils, trachea, bronchi, and alveoli are assaulted from the stench that emanates from the carpet!! It smells like a Chuck-e-Cheese.

I figure for $30.00 you could buy two large pizzas and two rotisserie chickens at Costco down the street and feast for a few days. But the WORST part was looking over the take out counter and noticing how dirty the phone, fax machine and credit card reader were! It grossed me out to think that the very nice young man who was preparing my order had been touching that grime prior to bagging up my food. It wouldn't take much to get a cleaning rag and small brush from the kitchen and clean the machines and phone once in awhile! Maybe most customers don't notice such details, but I always do.

Brandon L.,"Arcadia, CA",359,164,412,4.0,11/29/2017,"This review is more of a 3.5 stars, rather than a 3 star. This CPK is located at the fashion valley mall on the first floor. My girlfriend and I decided to eat here after some Christmas shopping, so it was a great place to sit down and enjoy some pizza. Food: I ordered the California Club pizza, and my girlfriend ordered the original bbq chicken pizza. The california club pizza has bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, topped with avocado, basil and arugula tossed in a really light lemon-pepper mayo. I thought at first that the lemon-pepper mayo would be overbearing, but it actually was really light and did not overpower the taste of the pizza. If this pizza had tomatoes, it would be THAT much better. The original bbq chicken pizza is tasty; there is a reason why it's the first pizza on the pizza menu. It's really basic, yet surprises me every time. The crust here is amazing as well. The dough is soft, and carries the pizza nicely. Oh yeah, forgot to mention the complementary bread and olive oil. That's really good too. :x Ambiance: CPK is clean, and comfortable inside and outside on their patio. We sat outside because it was a nice day. There are plenty of tables outside, and the noise level from the mall wasn't bad at all. I'd recommend it for any type of event such as birthday parties, since they do have tables that'll accompany large parties.   Service: The customer service was great at all aspects of the restaurant. We were seated right away, and our waiter quickly came and was polite and respectful in all of our interactions. Nothing to fret about here.  I have always enjoyed CPK, and this location is probably the best one I've been to.

They used to have a yummy alfredo ravioli. I've been to the CPK at Fashion Valley twice already but this past Friday was my first time going to their new location in the mall. CPK used to be located upstairs next to the food court but they are now located downstairs underneath AMC Movie Theater. I never even noticed before, I wonder when they moved?  When we came in the hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait so my friend and I went shopping, only 7 minutes after putting our name down we got a text that our table was ready! Wow! nice and fast! I ordered the Crispy Mac & Cheese, BBQ Chicken Pizza and a coke. The waiter was nice and I told him I couldn't finish the whole pizza by myself and he gave me a personal size pizza which was only $5.95. The crispy mac & cheese balls are pretty small and not as good as the Fried mac & cheese at the Cheesecake Factory but I still order it since I'm a mac & cheese lover.

This new location in the mall has moved to the lower level and it's around back near Boudin. It's really nice and modern looking with a cute outdoor patio too. Parking in the structures on that side is most convenient for accessing the restaurant. Not only was the event amazing because they served us a bunch of food, but we also got ""goodie bags"" that came in pizza boxes which included a cookbook, CPK sunglasses, a t-shirt, and a $25 gift card! So, of course a few of us who attended the event went back to use our gift cards a couple days ago. Since we went in the afternoon, they had a lunch portion of their menu. I decided to do the half sandwich + half salad combo for $10.95. You have the option to upgrade to a full sandwich for a few dollars extra and I considered it, but I was really happy I didn't. The half sandwich is huge! I got the roasted turkey and brie sandwich with a caesar salad. They were both super delicious. I also tried the crispy mac & cheese plate and those were really tasty too.

We saw the inside of the restaurant briefly but it looked so much more updated than the original! Great job on the renovations!  Saturday wasn't too busy at all, Bryan and I opted to sit outside because it was such a wonderful day, again I am thoroughly impressed by the seating on the patio.

Umut K.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,4,,2.0,1/13/2018,What's wrong with this place? I ordered fettuccine with chicken and the plate was ridiculous. It was impossible to find the chickens at the plate and pasta was dry for days. The chef who prepares this meal really thinks that people would eat that plate with no odjection? I rejected the plate and ordered spaghetti and another ridiculous plate came in.Plate was huge but the meal inside is very small. It is impossible to consider it as dinner and get full. What's really wrong with this place? Don't they see the other restaurants' plate? The waitress was nice she was trying to make up the things but there was really not so many things that she could fix.  This place doesn't even deserve any stat at all.If all California Pizza Kitchens are like this place then something is wrong with this brand,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego
Atsila W.,"Coronado, CA",20,55,144,4.0,11/20/2017,I love going here when I'm at the mall. I usually go for lunch and have a really good experience. The new location is really nice. Ive been a couple of times and have sat outside each time. It's shaded and in a quiet part of the mall which means I can actually here my friends outside.  So I love the pizza here its so good and much the the chagrin of my friends I usually always get the same thing. Well today I decided to get something new. They have a new braised short rib Chipotle mac'n'cheese which was so good. The beef short ribs were so tender and flavorful it was the best part of the dish. The Chipotle mac and cheese part was good too but they had green onions and cilantro in it which really threw off the flavor for me I could have done without those. My family got the lunch Duo which I think is fabulous. Miniature personal Pizzas and either a soup or salad the pepperoni as usual was fabulous and my mom decided to try their pepperoni sausage and mushroom which she said was out of the box for her but she really enjoyed it. They both like the new location as well they've been to the old one. I know I'll be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego

They must of been short staffed, because there were PLENTY of tables for everyone to pick and choose if they wanted to. We opted to just grab bar seats which worked out perfect.  The bartender was very friendly and informative. She was chatty but not always in your convo. Nice lady! The bar of people kept her busy but she never missed a beat. We told her we wanted the sangria and she gave her input. So we opted to do TWO and try them ourselves & was pleasantly surprised.

They have interesting menu item descriptions, but when you get your food, you become forever scarred of the boring flavor that fills your mouth. The flavors in their pizzas and pastas matches only that of oven-made meals from your home. Their food just doesn't taste as fresh as they claim.  Thus, the food is just okay. They don't give me that ""mmm... soo good"" feeling, and I would much rather dine at the Cheesecake Factory. The service at this CPK is average and not really up to par with other chain restaurants.

MRenee B.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,2,3.0,6/29/2013,"I have been coming here regularly for years, and I've always had great service until recently. I came in alone, on a Friday night to grab a bite before my movie started. I TOTALLY get that it's packed/crazy and you can expect a wait, but I also know it's open seating at the bar. In the past, 'in the bar' included the tall bistro tables back in the bar area. There were a few open, so I went and sat at one, only to be told that wasn't bar seating and I needed to move(all the times in the past, I told it was bar seating...confusing...). Ok...so the only place left was a seat at the end of the bar right in the 'to go' order pickup area. It's a small, short counter with 2 chairs, and you have a view directly of the kitchen/GARBAGE CAN, etc....def. the WORST seat in the house (I'm actually surprised/ashamed they will even allow people to dine there, literally at eye level w/ the garbage can, mops, cash register/break room, etc. RIGHT in front of you). BUT--I did, b/c again it was my choice to come on a Friday evening rush and not wait the 30 min for a table in the main dining hall. I wasn't excited about my 'view,' but, I love the food/service so was prepared to deal with it. Right when I sat down, a lady also sat down next to me. NEITHER of us were approached by anyone. Finally after about 10 min I asked some random guy walking by if we can even order here? He looked annoyed, and was like, 'uhhh, sure.....hold on.' The lady and I looked at each other like...'seriously?!' So he comes back maybe 5 mintues later and quickly just takes our drink order, not asking if we're eating, etc....and rushes away before we can say we actually want to eat. Also, neither of us was EVER given WATER or even offered water! It was litearlly 20 min later when I finally grabbed him to put in a food order. Then another woman ended up coming to actually give the check (served in a water glass?)....it was painfully obvious I, and my seat mate were just a total pain in the butt for them. We both ordered and paid as much as a normal 'diner,' but were treated more horribly than second class citizens. It was sooooo disappointing, this is always my go-to spot before a movie, but I will NEVER sit at that spot again. I felt like me ordering and giving them my money/service was a pain, my seat mate agreed it was close to the worst service we've ever had.  Sorry you were annoyed to have our money and business...next time we may just take it elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360
Madeline S.,"La Mesa, CA",64,39,,3.0,5/20/2009,So delicious. I really recommend this place. The thai chicken pizza is one of my favorites and the bbq salad they have. Oh man.. So good. You can also take it to go and walk across to AMC theater and watch a movie. They let you bring it in. Never been to any other location but this one so I cant vouch for the others. Make sure they dont burn your crust. They tend to do this sometimes. Make sure your pizza is right before you leave if you get take out. They put pepperoni on my vegetarian boyfriend's pizza and he didnt get lunch that day because he didnt have enough time to wait for another.

Teo K.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/25/2007,"I like to stop in to CPK now and then for a BBQ Chicken salad and Tequilla pasta. These are like comfort foods for me. I will never again go to this loction again though. I went on a busy night and the place was not staffed well. I took this into consideration as I waited for our server. After I ordered a bottled beer I waited ten minutes for the server to return only to not have her take our food order. I grabed her attention before she left and let her know that we ready and gave her our order. 30 min. later we got our food. The regular sized salad was served on the large oval plate as normal, but it was barely  an inch high in the middle as it sloaped down to the sides of the plate. Now, I've been coming to CPK for over 10 years now and was sure that this was far less than the normal portion. My server was once again nowhere to be found (even though the place was now less than half full) I asked to see a manager. He told me that the portion size was correct and made no apologies for the wait. He in no way wanted to take the dish back or make amends. He walked away and I walked out food untouched and bill unpaid. 5 min. later I had a lovely overpriced meal at Cheesecake Factory. I have since gone to the La jolla loction and was happy with both the service and meal.

After letting the manager know what she had said, he too said that was an unacceptable response! After bringing us the bill minus the price of the ""hairy"" pizza we found ANOTHER hair in a different pizza! When we pointed that out to her as we were paying and she was clearing the plates, she RUDELY said ""Well that's why I'm taking these away!"" Megan needs a good lesson on customer service and how to apologize for mistakes  and not be SNOOTY about it!

When I moved to Mission Valley in San Diego I was psyched to see a CPK right in the Fashion Valley Mall.  We went in and had a fantastic meal.  Every time I have dined here the service has always been consistent and fast.  The food never disappoints, and the portions are great. They just added a new crab cake to their menu a couple of months ago, called the Baja Crab cake and it's hands down the best crab cake I've had in San Diego, and trust me I eat a lot of crab cakes. Their pizzas are really delicious.  If it doesn't have pork on it (damn allergies) I'll try it.   My favorite pizzas are as follows: Margarita on thin crust Thai Chicken Greek Pizza Four Cheese with sundried tomatoes aaaand the one with the pears.  The name escapes me now and I know you're think ""umm, pears, really?""  Trust me it's delicious. CPK can pretty much stick anything onto a crust and make it good.

I have to give this place 3 stars only because of our waiter.  The food was pretty terrible, but our waiter was fun.  I wish I could remember his name.  He was super friendly and took my sarcasm (and even gave me some back!) without feeling insulted.  He seemed to enjoy our table, and he was quite a trooper.  So for him, I give this place 3-stars.  Also, it's pretty clean.  Clean is good.  But the food here is awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=220

Andee S.,"Bermuda Dunes, CA",124,105,70,2.0,7/8/2014,"I was so disappointed with our experience at this CPK.  One of the great things about CPK is their consistency.  However this particular location leaves much to be desired. First, let me say, our server Colby was awesome.  He was fast, courteous and responsive. Shortly after we ordered our food, we noticed that there was a stream of ants crawling across the windowsill which was really really dirty.  This windowsill looked as if it had not been cleaned in weeks.  There were literally dead insects on the windowsill covered in dust in addition to the ants.  As soon as we noticed the ants, we asked if we could move, and Colby was super in accommodating us and helping us get moved to our new table. After we moved, someone came and reset the two person booth that we had just left.  They then proceeded to seat another couple at the booth.  We were confused because we noticed that the windowsill had not actually been cleaned.  After a few minutes, those people also requested to be moved.  Even after both parties mentioned the ants, no one came and cleaned the booth windowsill.  We had to sit at the table nearby the whole time, knowing that the ants were still running wild. While Colby did an excellent job accommodating us and serving us, at no time did a manager come to speak with us or apologize.  Nor did anyone do the same for the other party who had to be moved.  Additionally, as we left, we mentioned the problem to the manager standing at the host stand and still received no apology.  In fact after we mentioned in, we walked around the corner where we could still see inside and the manager never left the host station to even investigate. As always, the food was delicious.  We had the Mushroom, Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza and split the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  Both were really good, and up to par with our regular CPK experiences. And I highly recommend the Agave Mojito, it was superb.   I don't think I will ever patronize this CPK again, as it was clear that cleanliness is just not important to the staff in general.  I would probably have given this review only 1 star if it weren't for the great service from Colby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=140

The watermelon and strawberries were juicy, the pistachios gave it a good crunch and the feta cheese was a good addition.  All on top of baby greens, arugala and mint - I will get the dressing on the side next time; it was a light housemade Champagne vinaigrette but way over-dressed.  The mac & cheese was a great surprise; little bites fried in bread crumbs with a cheese sauce on the plate. Comes with 4 pieces and was a perfect side to the salad. Overall a good experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=140
Rocco S.,"Newport News, VA",15,38,1,2.0,12/28/2014,"Ok I get it that it was a holiday weekend.  However if you are open for business make it happen. The service was lousy. The waiter was hopelessly lost, barely spoke to us , left our plates all over the table, never checked back, no drink refills. Should I keep going Yup Food is going down fast. Make sure you can skimp on the food as much as you can. $15.OO for a tasteless salad. The Cobb was garbage,  green hard tomatoes, a pinch of chicken,  dry.I had to ask for more dressing, didn't help, watered down. flat bread pizza , ridiculous crap. The ice tea was good, would of liked more. Never got it. In fashion valley of all places, and right across from the movies.  Maybe their lease is up.

Who knew that CPK had the best Chile Relleno in town??? One in our group raved about it. I ordered the Works pizza with extra cheese but somehow it came out without any cheese at all.

Brandon L.,"Arcadia, United States",359,164,412,4.0,29/11/2017,"This review is more of a 3.5 stars, rather than a 3 star. This CPK is located at the fashion valley mall on the first floor. My girlfriend and I decided to eat here after some Christmas shopping, so it was a great place to sit down and enjoy some pizza. Food: I ordered the California Club pizza, and my girlfriend ordered the original bbq chicken pizza. The california club pizza has bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, topped with avocado, basil and arugula tossed in a really light lemon-pepper mayo. I thought at first that the lemon-pepper mayo would be overbearing, but it actually was really light and did not overpower the taste of the pizza. If this pizza had tomatoes, it would be THAT much better. The original bbq chicken pizza is tasty; there is a reason why it's the first pizza on the pizza menu. It's really basic, yet surprises me every time. The crust here is amazing as well. The dough is soft, and carries the pizza nicely. Oh yeah, forgot to mention the complementary bread and olive oil. That's really good too. :x Ambiance: CPK is clean, and comfortable inside and outside on their patio. We sat outside because it was a nice day. There are plenty of tables outside, and the noise level from the mall wasn't bad at all. I'd recommend it for any type of event such as birthday parties, since they do have tables that'll accompany large parties.   Service: The customer service was great at all aspects of the restaurant. We were seated right away, and our waiter quickly came and was polite and respectful in all of our interactions. Nothing to fret about here.  I have always enjoyed CPK, and this location is probably the best one I've been to. Order the pizzas, you won't be disappointed; it is what they're known for, right??",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego

What type of company wouldn't have a decent level of customer service to fix what they did wrong? Apparently CPK.

I ended up sitting at a booth, which is usually great for me, but for some reason this particular booth was a hightop booth, so I had dangling feet most of the time. WTF, CPK? Our server was great. The food was decidedly decent--from the warm complimentary bread and olive oil dip to personal pizzas and salads. They offered up some nice local beers and made a decent margarita.

Picked up the order; yep, sure enough, she was working by herself, line in front of her and the phone ringing constantly.  THIS IS TAKEOUT on a holiday where most people are off and eating out.  Very poor management...clearly....they shouldn't be open if they cannot properly staff their place and handle the multitude of people ordering.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego

I remember where I grew up in Norcal they had a CPK Express at the local mall and it was nice to get CPK food for cheap! It was pretty much their fast-food version! They used to have a yummy alfredo ravioli. I've been to the CPK at Fashion Valley twice already but this past Friday was my first time going to their new location in the mall. CPK used to be located upstairs next to the food court but they are now located downstairs underneath AMC Movie Theater. I never even noticed before, I wonder when they moved?  When we came in the hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait so my friend and I went shopping, only 7 minutes after putting our name down we got a text that our table was ready! Wow! nice and fast! I ordered the Crispy Mac & Cheese, BBQ Chicken Pizza and a coke. The waiter was nice and I told him I couldn't finish the whole pizza by myself and he gave me a personal size pizza which was only $5.95. The crispy mac & cheese balls are pretty small and not as good as the Fried mac & cheese at the Cheesecake Factory but I still order it since I'm a mac & cheese lover.  Service was excellent, our server was on point. Thanks for a great experience CPK! I'll be back!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego
Kathy S.,"San Diego, United States",79,228,572,5.0,2/11/2017,"I came here a few weeks ago for a private event they were hosting to debut some of their new menu items. This new location in the mall has moved to the lower level and it's around back near Boudin. It's really nice and modern looking with a cute outdoor patio too. Parking in the structures on that side is most convenient for accessing the restaurant. Not only was the event amazing because they served us a bunch of food, but we also got ""goodie bags"" that came in pizza boxes which included a cookbook, CPK sunglasses, a t-shirt, and a $25 gift card! So, of course a few of us who attended the event went back to use our gift cards a couple days ago. Since we went in the afternoon, they had a lunch portion of their menu. I decided to do the half sandwich + half salad combo for $10.95. You have the option to upgrade to a full sandwich for a few dollars extra and I considered it, but I was really happy I didn't. The half sandwich is huge! I got the roasted turkey and brie sandwich with a caesar salad. They were both super delicious. I also tried the crispy mac & cheese plate and those were really tasty too. Both times I've gone in the past few weeks the staff have been amazingly friendly and welcoming.

The original location was really close to the food court, but now that they've moved to the first level, the improvements have been amazing. Prior to their move, the seats on their ""patio,"" were pretty basic and compact, the new patio is a lot more open with updated tables and seating. We saw the inside of the restaurant briefly but it looked so much more updated than the original! Great job on the renovations!  Saturday wasn't too busy at all, Bryan and I opted to sit outside because it was such a wonderful day, again I am thoroughly impressed by the seating on the patio. We started off with the corn salsa and chips, which we love and their complimentary bread and olive oil. Tasty, for sure I always love their corn salsa! They have a CPK rewards system, totally free to register and I think you still receive a coupon for a free starter.  Bryan orders a pizza and I order a the jambalaya pasta, this is my favorite thing to order here! I love the andouille sausage they add to the pasta along with the crawdads, if you want something spicy and filling this pasta is perfect for you.

The new location is like a breath of fresh air, its spacious, its modern, the colors are vibrant, the staff is very friendly. The restaurant is a representation of San Diego with awesome photography on the walls. The hostess ""Lauren"" was very nice, she showed us to our seat (which was a nice boosted chair booth) Lauren told us that they just grand opened the new restaurant 2 weeks ago and that they've added new items to CPK menu and working on adding more items soon.  Our table waiter ""Alex"" was a cool guy, he brought us some yummy on the house French bread   and a olive oil dip that tasted bomb . Com.

Ive been a couple of times and have sat outside each time. It's shaded and in a quiet part of the mall which means I can actually here my friends outside.  So I love the pizza here its so good and much the the chagrin of my friends I usually always get the same thing. Well today I decided to get something new. They have a new braised short rib Chipotle mac'n'cheese which was so good. The beef short ribs were so tender and flavorful it was the best part of the dish. The Chipotle mac and cheese part was good too but they had green onions and cilantro in it which really threw off the flavor for me I could have done without those. My family got the lunch Duo which I think is fabulous. Miniature personal Pizzas and either a soup or salad the pepperoni as usual was fabulous and my mom decided to try their pepperoni sausage and mushroom which she said was out of the box for her but she really enjoyed it.

To start it was the night before my wife's birthday and we wanted to spoil ourselves and be a little lazy. We placed an order through grubhub at 745, received a 'driver is on their way' notification about 15 minutes later. An hour and a half later we still hadn't got our food so my wife started calling, the conclusion was that the grubhub order would be cancelled and we would put an identical order in directly and i would pick it up.  No problem with cpk yet, at this point they seemed to be wanting to help. I went to the take out window at cpk and the lady asked me if i was the one who had the grubhub issue.  I said yes, and she stated that the order would be ready in five minutes because pizzas were still in the oven.   No problem yet.  I asked to pay, she accepted, i paid and sat down at the bar and waited. Then some lady came over and dropped the salads and apps on the bar and said the pizzas would be up soon.   I thought this was odd because the food was not in a bag and every other time i had gotten take out from there the food came in Bags. I asked the lady if she was going to bag the food.  She went grabbed two bags and dropped them on the food and stated the bigger bag was for the pizzas. I then asked, do you expect me to bag my food?   And she replied that she doesn't have to bag food for grubhub customers and she then dropped my pizzas in the bag was holding open. She dropped the pizzas in sideways!    At this point i became irate, tossed all the food on the bar and demanded a refund.   The manager came over and stated that it was a misunderstanding. Wrong dude, even if i was a grubhub only customer, you don't treat customers like that.  Besides this, i just paid them directly for the food. After All i just dropped $130 on some pizzas and salads.  This place is run by clowns, the service is horrible.  Do not eat here.  I used to love the food and after they ruined this night i wont ever be able to eat here again.

The wait is never more than 10 minutes and the servers are always responsive and take care of you very well. I usually have to ask for their complimentary bread, which is fine as i Imagine some people don't want to start their meal with bread and would rather wait for what they ordered. But the bread is delicious and super fresh, so I would recommend to ask for it :) I love their spicy chipotle chicken hand tossed pizza and i always add avacado to it. I also love the Tostada pizza which is a thin crust pizza - mexican style. It does not have traditional red sauce, but rather has a black bean base topped with lettuce, cheese, and chips. You can add chicken or another meat for an additional cost to this, but I usually stick to veggie.  The drinks are pretty great as well, good for the price and delicious.  A great tip for veggies/allergies: The CPK Website has an extremely detailed Allergen Menu which basically mentions EVERY single ingredient used in their dishes. So if you are strict vegetarian, or have any kind of allergies, you can easily lookup the dish you are interested in ordering - and it will tell you what it has. I know they have gluten free crust which attracts a lot of my co-workers, but I have never personally tried that one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=40

Eric brought out my pizza and as he was putting it down in front of me, he said he wasn't totally happy with it because the crust was slightly burnt and said he was making a new one! I didn't have to say anything (even though I wasn't even disappointed by the first pizza). Amazing customer service, I'm very impressed! They also didn't charge me for the pizza at all...wow!

Although the wait was 40 minutes it was well worth it. Immediately upon being seated our waiter came over to ask if we cared for a drink as well as if we wanted bread. The bread and beverages came instantly. I decided to have the avocado club egg rolls and my hubby had the chicken fettuccine. Within 10 minutes our meal arrived and this was a fully packed restaurant with patrons still waiting outside to be seated. My egg rolls were delicious. There were chunks of chicken, avocado, tomatoes, monterey jack and apple wood smoked bacon. Everything is better with bacon. This was so good my hubby kept taking bites out of my egg rolls. His fettuccine was rich, creamy and perfectly blended. Definitely not from a jar. The pasta was perfectly cooked with large chucks of chicken throughout the dish.

My most recent visit was a weekday lunch stop however.  I typically visit at night or on a weekend so I hadn't had the opportunity to try their lunch duos before. It is a good deal!  You get to choose a soup and salad, or a soup or salad and a sandwich or pizza. I eat a LOT so I'm constant wondering if something like this will be enough food. It is perfect. I went with a pizza and soup combo. The BBQ chicken pizza is one of my favorites anyway and it was great as a personal size as well. The tortilla soup was creamy but delicious.

I order the same avocado rolls, barbecue chicken chopped salad and a margarita. My husband likes to change it up and get different pizzas. The fav is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza. He got a jalapeño margarita and ended up getting it again. When you find something on the menu that you like at CPK, there's no need to look at the menu anymore. Just wish the service was faster.

When we replied back by saying hey what's up his attitude changed. Man do I hate how people judge others by just looking at them. Well we were seated and our waitress brought us our menus no problem. Took our order no problem. Food took awhile I ordered the Thai chicken salad took 3 bites and that was all I could eat. The sauce or whatever was on my salad was very spicy for my taste. Waitress saw that I left my salad never bothered to ask me if their was something wrong with my food. My daughter  ordered a pepperoni pizza it tasted like card board. I finished my drink was never asked if I wanted a refilled. Worst customer service. I will never eat here again. Food taste like crap and their customer service was awful.

We were seated immediately in a comfy booth. Our server definitely had upselling on his mind, but it was a bit over the top and pushy in my opinion. Instead of asking if we wanted a cocktail, we were asked if we wanted this option or the other? It made me feel a bit awkward to say no. Other than that, our service was prompt and we were well taken care of.  The bread that came out was hot, fresh and served with a flavorful herbed olive oil. We had the original BBQ chopped salad and the club pizza. As I was looking over the menu, I noticed how similar so many of the items are on the menu. Avocado, bacon, chicken, and strawberries seem to be the overall theme here. My salad was tasty, but tasted very similar to my husbands pizza which was disappointing since we were sharing. The hot pizza with a pile of arugula and lettuce was an odd concept that we didn't love. Granted, we knew that when we ordered it..it just sounded better than it was.

She immediately said, ""Sorry for the wait i just got here."" Seemed unprofessional and perhaps poor planning on the hostesses part. She wasn't familiar with a margarita we requested, confirmed It with the bartender, then the wrong drink was still delivered. It took awhile to get her back to place our food order and the food was not worth the wait. Don't bother with the artichoke dip, it's disgusting. A few minutes before our food arrived she offered us bread with oil which was fine until I realized the table next to us had balsamic and oil with their bread.

The thin crust was wonderful and the toppings were great. Love the tostada pizza and we even added avocado. Would go back for both pizzas they were yummy for a work lunch.  Service: We opted to sit outside because it was a sunny beautiful day. Our waiter pretty much forgot about us and was in a rush every contact with us, he was basically walking away whenever we asked for anything because he was rushing to go back inside.

I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza and after a short wait it came out. It was ok. Not the best, not the worst. I thought the price tag was a little ridiculous for the pizza I got, definitely overpriced pizza. I suppose you're paying for the sit down location of it. Overall, average ok experience.

We also ordered two pastas the garlic cream fettuccine which was not creamy it was dry. The other pasta that we order was the kung Pao spaghetti which was the only thing I really enjoyed, but I felt like I got ripped off with the amount of chicken that I paid extra for. I also did not like the over priced Caesar salad that we ordered I would understand if there was a twist or something special, but there wasn't definetely not worth my 12 bucks. The bread that they started us out with could had been good if it came with butter, but it came with oil instead which made the bread too greasy.

Everything from the food to the service to the mellow ambiance. I appreciate how they bring fresh, warm bread and butter to the table because that seems like a rarity these days. It was a great beginning to the meal and ensured that I wasn't hungry while waiting for my meal. I ordered the pizza and salad lunch special, which is a better deal than ordering items by themselves. My Caesar salad was delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised by the shaved Parmesan. It added a lot of flavor. I would have preferred if it had been tossed before service, but that's a minor complaint. My personal pizza was their BBQ chicken specialty. They claim to be the inventors of the BBQ pizza, and while I don't know if this is accurate, the pizza was delicious! The crust was in between New York thin and regular thickness, and it had a good crunch. Each bite of the pizza with the combination of BBQ sauce, chicken, red onions, and cheese was a delight. Coincidentally, my girlfriend got the BBQ chicken salad. It was tossed in a light ranch dressing with BBQ chicken on top. I liked it better than I expected. It was a half-salad, but it was still more than she could eat in one sitting.

So I asked the server for another dressing as I noticed not enough dressing.  I ate less the half the salad and ordered a Thai chicken pizza. The pizza took almost 30 minutes. The chicken on the pizza was cold. As I was hungry I ate couple slices only. Not one time did the manager come over and ask can I get you something else. The server was the best part about the hole dinning experience.  Would I come back here again. The answer is no. If you can avoid the location I would.

So much flavor with the butter and blue cheese dressing on the top of the steak. The only thing about ordering this is that it's either a hit or a miss with whoever cooks it. Do not order medium well because your steak will come out so hard. Even when I order medium sometimes it's still over cooked. Like it said hit or miss but when it hits it's amazing.

Fiona M.,"San Diego, United States",103,171,117,1.0,17/1/2017,"OMG! NEVER AGAIN! KEEP WALKING! Lots of better places to eat in this mall.  I thought CPK was a brand I could trust. NOT HERE! We started lunch around 3pm. It's a popular location, in a big shopping mall so we had a brief wait for a table. No problem.  We were seated in a nice booth and ordered drinks.  I got up to use the woman's restroom; it was VILE. I walked out, notified the hostess and asked for an alternative bathroom.  The hostess used her pen and pointed it over the bridge of my nose to direct me out a patio door to a mall restroom nearby. I had to step back. I don't know why she thought that was appropriate... People have different bubble spaces so...idk what that was about? Whatever. Anyway, I walked out the door she pointed to with her pen, and found an outdoor patio with no exit. Great.  So, I walked back into the restaurant, climbed over some children and people who were crammed in the entrance waiting to check in for a table, squeezed out the door and waiting in line for almost 10 min to use the mall restroom.  When I returned, our drinks had still not been served.  I asked to speak to the manager who arrived promptly. I explained the restroom situation. He returned later and stated the hostesses had taken care of the problem and he apologized for the inconvenience.  After all of that, we finally placed an order. My order was from the gluten free menu.  Almost 30 minutes later, a food runner appears with two pizzas that look relatively the same. I asked, ""Is that gluten free?""  Food Runner; ""Um, it doesn't' look like it. I am not sure. I don't really know. Do you want me to check?""  Me; ""Yes, yes I definitely want you to check."" Waitress came back owned the mistake and apologized. Gluten free pizza being rushed.  I really appreciate when people own their mistakes.  Gluten free pizza FINALLY arrived. We had a couple of other misunderstandings with the staff; we asked for water refills and only one empty glass was filled. Had to ask as second and third time. Relatively minor snafus. The waitress was super nice and owned every mistake.  Finally finished, I put down my credit card to pay.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands. REALLY? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME CPK! The revolting restroom had not changed since my first visit. UNBELIEVABLE! I again notified the manager.  CPK, if you have a restaurant that can seat 148 people, and a restroom with only two stalls...don't you think you could stay on top of keeping it clean? If you can't keep your restroom clean after a customer has informed you, what is going on with the food???  An hour and a half later, $53.18 down plus tip, several bizarre but forgivable incidents behind us, both my daughter and I banned this place for life.

I've been to this location inside the Fashion Valley mall a couple of times and like their service and the cozy outdoor seating area. Great for people watching and sipping on your Strawberry Mojito! Food quality was good, the SUMMER STRAWBERRY SALAD being my favorite. Nothing beats a fresh salad topped with delicious strawberries! The MARGARITA PIZZA is simple but thin-crusted and tasty. Finally, the CAJUN PASTA was the heaviest dish on the table and was certainly filling - with a little bit too much Cajun if you ask me.

So I'm thrilled that they now offer gluten-free crust. The crust was good (as good as gluten-free crust can be). We had the artichoke heart and spinach pizza which was enough for the two of us. The lemonade was a little too sweet and the cranberry cooler was lacking in flavor, so we mixed them together which made both better.

I was working in the area while my favorite gals caught a silver screen presentation at the theater. I believe that the CPK lunch menu runs until 4pm. It wasn't crowded on a weekday afternoon and getting a table was easy well after typical lunch rush hours. Although the patio tables were open, the inside dining room was bustling and the bar seats were all taken. TVs were playing sports highlights. Service was pleasant and cordial. Our waiter came by a few times to check on us and refill drinks. The California Veggie pizza is a veritable cornucopia of garden fresh ingredients: baby broccoli, Cremini mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, eggplant, and red onions. I added goat cheese and it was great. The Mediterranean salad is delicious as well: crisp greens, diced tomatoes, sliced olives, red onion, chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans), and feta crumble. Great lunch-sized portions that can fill the tummy without the debilitating food coma afterwards. I'll be hungry again soon.

And the chips that came with it were not from a bag, they looked fried in-store, which is a plus. I also tried the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla, which was very filling for my mood at the time.

Akava K.,"El Cajon, United States",82,46,303,4.0,18/11/2016,This is your high end Pizza place. I went there with my friend that is also a vet  on Veterans Day for the free food that they had. No lie love free food and they have good food and even gluten free. Now our hostess was grate even though we were there for the free food she was there just the same as if we were paying. Now the wait was a bit however for free food there will always be a wait. However they were fast at cleaning tables and getting people seated. Now if you want a good hostess look at pic and get her she is grate love her. Let's get to the food. We got gluten free pizza now most are ok even BJs is not that good but I like to stay gluten free as much As I can. To my surprise when I took a bit of it it was really good. I guess that is what you expect form a high end place. They even had BJs beat by a miles on that one to my surprise. Agin the hostess came back to see how every thing was going serval times filled my water up because I don't drink soda bad for you at meal time by the way. Now this one of those places you think cost a bit of a pizza so you don't really look at it that hard because you spend good money and not that good it just like all the others you get mad at your self. Now when they offer free food you go and check it out. By the why they take care of us  vets love them for that. Now that is a place I did not go last year on Veterans Day I should kick my self because I though it was just like the rest and went to BJs well now I know better. I have to say they have a nice gluten free menu and there real real good in services better the BJs and nicer for the most part there real about being nice not like BJs were it's just s fake smile. Now our hostess had a grate smile and to was real for her  heart. That is what makes a good hostess and I know she was tired form the long day but that smile was still there and it was real. That is a place you go to enjoy your self and be around real people that care for there jobs even that manger was grate. You see I use my credit cards and don't carry cash however I wanted to leave her a tip come to find out she just stated there not to long ago so the manger help her out so I could giver her a tip because remember free food so they did not charge me but he did a good one showed her how to get a tip from my card that was nice. By the way she was one I tipped 25% my average tip is 10% she was that good to us and always had that smile. she earned it every dime.

This location in general needs a remodel.  It's in the nicest most upscale mall in SD where they now offer seasons 52, true foods, pf changs and many other great places around the same price with a much nicer look and feel to them.  The bathrooms were really dark, the tables are older and it's just not a fashion valley mall type of feeling.  I understand it's better than eating in the good court and it's next to the movie theater but all the other restaurants are no further of a walking distance.  The only positive I can say for yesterday's lunch was that they have improved their bread and it's truly delicious.  They're old bread was just plain and the butter was hard as it had just come out of the fridge but the new bread is warm, soft and it comes with a really good olive oil and seasoning dip!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=80

Name Withheld K.,"San Diego, United States",4,187,155,2.0,18/10/2015,"I have been to this location twice now, and have decided that this particular CPK doesn't have as good of food or service as the other CPKs that I've been to. Also, on both of my visits to this location there was an issue with my food AND the service was weird. On the first visit, the restaurant was pretty dead, and somehow, there was an avocado pit in my shrimp caesar salad - odd considering that there's no avocado in caesar salad. On this visit, our server was nice, but kind of over the top and I don't feel that he was as professional as he should have been. Although, I did appreciate that he at least paid attention to me and my husband so that was no big deal. Overall, that experience was about on par/slightly less than what I have come to expect at California Pizza Kitchen, but I was just stoked to be at the mall and not have to eat fast food. On the second visit, the restaurant was super busy, but my husband and I had a gift card from his parents that we wanted to use so we waited 25 minutes and were seated in the smallest, most in the way table that they had. Again, no big deal, they were busy & I was hungry, so whatever. (My husband and I are noticing a trend where we get the worst tables available no matter what.......wtf!!)  On this visit, our food had some issues but I didn't have it in me to complain right off the bat....To sum it up, the grilled shrimp in my caesar salad was cold (it's supposed to be grilled, and warm), and there were itty bitty bits of cold grilled chicken in my salad. I didn't complain about the salad, but looking back, I totally should have. However, what I did complain about was the fried mac & cheese bites. I took a bite of one and it was extremely cold in the middle. It was so cold and so nasty that I had to spit it out, and I can't really remember the last time that I did that. On this visit, our server was kind of a douche and I felt like he purposely ignored me and my husband. He was constantly checking on the table across from ours, but kept his back to us the whole time. He would literally be standing with his ass in my husbands face and we would try to get his attention but he was in such a hurry/not listening/not looking in our direction that we spent way, WAY, too long trying to get his attention. We finally gave up on getting his attention and flagged down whoever, whenever because we were sick of waiting for him. Now that I am taking the time to write all this down, the second visit was definitely worse than the first, and I didn't really enjoy my meal, or the experience there..... After thinking about it a bit, I feel genuinely ripped off. I thought the whole point of going to a chain restaurant was consistency? What's up CPK @ Fashion Valley? Things aren't looking so hot for you guys right now.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100
Trang N.,"San Diego, United States",700,233,375,5.0,1/11/2014,"To be honest I thought this was a pizza place but they actually have a variety of foods from bomb salads, to pastas, and so much more all at an affordable price!  Located at fashion valley mall , by the food court!  Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess who sat us right away. Our server mike is awesome, attentive and super friendly! He refilled our waters twice without us having to ask, and he provided us with such great service and always kept checking up on us as well as asking how the food is and how everything's going every now and then .  Great personality. When you have delicious dishes as well as a really good service - your whole dining experience is 100x better. We ordered pasta for our son which came with apple juice. The kids pasta I must admit  is large enough for an adult!  We also ordered the jambalaya fettuccine pasta and O M G if you've never tried it I highly recommend it! It consists of chicken, shrimp, and crawfish with sausage & ham with spicy Cajun sauce (it's not spicy where you can't eat it). This is large enough to share between two people, but of course if you both are hungry I would definitely order another dish to share as well.

We told him what it stood for and he responded... ""I don't know what the f*** that is"" I have never had a waiter use that language. Very unprofessional.  I will say the food was good, CPK is one of our favs and the food was just as good as ever.

Cindy D.,"San Diego, United States",42,317,1,5.0,10/12/2014,"Alright, alright, I know what you're thinking..... ""5 stars for a chain restaurant?"". Hear me out on this one: The reason I found myself at CPK on a Thursday night was because my aunt was hosting a fundraiser. CPK agreed to donate 20% of our bill to the Cheetah Conservation Fund. Twenty percent is a nice chunk- I appreciated they were so generous with their percentage.  Onto the food:  My date (a.k.a. my Mom) and I agreed to split a half salad. She picked the Italian Chopped salad. Would not have been my first choice because I'm not a huge fan of salami, but man, I'm glad I let her pick. The salad was great! The salami wasn't overpowering. The salad-to-dressing ratio was on point. I guess Mom always does know best. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine great! I usually give restaurants a ""4"" if I liked the food, and a ""5"" if I consider it ""unforgettable."" The dish had a lot of different flavors put together. I'd definitely get this again. On top of it all- our server was super friendly and not too ""sale-sy."" When he picked up on the fact that we weren't super hungry, he told us to just let him know if we wanted to look at dessert menus. He didn't bring them and try and guilt us into ordering more, which I really appreciated. Overall, CPK exceeded my expectations. Will go back, even when I'm not trying to save the cheetahs.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100
Shane S.,"Lakeside, United States",10,80,2,5.0,8/5/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen is one of my all-time favorite restaraunts. It was a Friday at about 3pm, so of course it was packed, but we were seated, orders taken, and served in a good amount of time. Servers were really great, and definetly earned the tip.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza. it's so great! The pizzas on their menu are medium-sized, perfect for sharing -- or not :) A couple of pizzas, and a beer and another drink, and a soup, total was a bit over $40. I'd say that's a pretty resonable price, considering how much food we got. I love this place and cannot wait to go back.  And I 100000% reccomend their deserts.

Mikhail R.,"San Diego, United States",234,25,41,4.0,24/11/2015,"I have never been to a California Pizza Kitchen, so I was very excited to make a first visit. There are two, near where I live, so I decided to go to the Fashion Valley location because I was just leaving campus, and it was the closer option. I was given a $50 gift card to CPK, so I came in one day after a long day at school. Upon my arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar by the host. He was friendly, and gave me the option to sit at a table, but since I was all by myself, I chose the latter. I looked at the menu before I was approached by a waiter, named Renee. She took my drink order first, and I got the Caribbean Sangria, and a glass of water. I came in around noon, and the lunch special was still on so I took advantage of that.  She came back with my drinks and apologized for not having pineapple in my drinks, and I laughed and told her it was perfectly fine. She came back a couple minutes later with a plate of chopped pineapples. It was a simple gesture, but all the more appreciated. The sangria was really really delicious. I've had my fair share of sangrias, but that drink alone could keep me coming back. So with that, my first impression was already off to a great start. She took my food order, and I got the lunch special with a caesar salad and their specialty, bbq chicken pizza. After that, Renee gave me some bread while I waited, and sipped on my sangria. My food came out and the salad was okay. Can't really blame them because all caesar salads that I've had taste the same, HAHAHA! Anywho, their pizza was really good. Loved the savory and smoky flavors.  Their food was very satisfactory, but the service I received from Renee was really really great. She kept conversation with me, kept checking back, did little things here and there that I didn't ask her to do, but she did anyways. Being self-efficient is definitely key to being a great employee, and Renee was outstanding. Kudos to her, and I'll definitely be making more trips back if service there is as good as hers :) Great first impression, CPK!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=100

In shocked we looked at each other and continued to also asked to sit in the patio but they didn't want to seat us outside either. The hostess then saw the manager walk by and asked her and the manager even said the same thing. One difference is that she did tell them to seat is outside but had us seated at different tables. They didn't even set the tables for us to be seated together. We have never been to a CPK and had this problem before.  ONE STAR  for the hostess and the manager.

Female who answered sounded very unwelcoming and disinterested. She quoted us 25 minutes. We got to the location a little early and checked in or at least attempted to. The portly, plain Jane hostess gave us an attitude. I told her we had called in ahead of time and she seemed to be in disbelief. At first, she said there was no record of my calling in. But then I noticed my name on the wait list. When I pointed this out to her, she seemed skeptical, stating, ""This doesn't look like a call in."" Truly bizarre reaction and accusation. Do you not want us to patronize your mediocre restaurant? We waited quite a while after that point. Nearly 50 minutes after my call, the portly hostess calls us. She notices we have a small child and then berates us in front many other guests with words to the effect of the following: ""You should have told me you had a child. Now you will have to wait longer. A child counts as a person."" Gee whiz, what a complete failure of customer service and professionalism. At last, the portly waitress seats us but only after 25 minutes beyond the wait we were promised. On the bright side, the food was decent and the server was much more friendly and on top of things. We still waited well over 30 minutes for food, however.

The peppers gave a hint of spice and sweetness. They also give you a lime which you can squeeze into the pasta giving it a sour taste. Doesn't that sound delicious?

Courtney O.,"San Diego, United States",616,649,571,5.0,4/4/2015,"Easily my favorite restaurant chain! Growing up, my mom and I used to go to CPK every Saturday night. Needless to say, a part of my childhood revolves around CPK (as strange as that sounds). I've grown up with the menu and watched it evolve with changes in soups, the addition of the small plates menu and the increase in gluten free items. Pretty much anything you eat here is delicious, but here are a few of my absolute favorites. The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad- This one is a classic. The blend of BBQ sauce and ranch over a mix of lettuce, tomatoes, corn, black beans and TORTILLA CHIPS is delicious! I'm not a huge meat eater so I like to substitute avocado for chicken. The California Club Sandwich-It has bacon in it. Enough said. It also comes with a soup or salad, so I always choose the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley to add on. Thai Chicken Pizza- There was a time when they took this off the menu, but it's back and it's got such a unique flavor. It's a must try! Tostada Pizza- It's like a Mexican style salad on your pizza. The only thing is that it doesn't keep very well, so you need to finish the whole thing at the restaurant. Great for sharing! Chocolate Souflle Cake-Yes, the red velvet is to die for and the butter cake melts in your mouth, but the chocolate souflle cake will forever be the greatest dessert to every grace the pages of the CPK dessert menu. It's so chocolatey and gooey. If you don't get it with ice cream, you're doing it wrong. Clearly, I'm a CPK nut but I love this place.

Not a fan of ranch dressing, but theirs....I seem to like it since they also drizzle BBQ sauce on top of the salad and the two together is very tasty.  Was bummed when I came back in a couple of years ago and the wonderful french bread they served was gone. In it's place was a non crusty bread I hated. I think that soured me on coming back.  Well, I guess I forgot about the bread and was just craving that salad and came back in last week. Lo and behold, they got an even better crusty bread than they originally had! Yay! And served with olive oil for dipping, Mediterranean style.  And that BBQ Chicken salad is just as good as it ever was. Small one is plenty if by yourself and not sharing.

I clarified with the take out order taker, twice, that I just signed up for their rewards program online and would like to use their $10 off $40 order. When I called at curbside, I confirmed my total. They did not apply my coupon. But the girl added it on quickly. The girl that brought out the food was very nice so that made me not FURIOUS about all this. Missing condiments and all. Sad.

The plates at my table were disgusting. When I told the busser, he yanked the plates from my hand and had our server bring less disgusting, yet still-dirty plates. I wiped mine down before use. No one acknowledged the issue, they all played it down. The pizza was mediocre. I left feeling hungry after having four slices. The crust was unremarkable, better than stale crackers, I guess. The mozzarella had nice flavor, but the texture was too chewy. Total lack of sauce, prepare for cottonmouth if you choose to dine here. The toppings were scarce and an afterthought.

Our waiter Alex did not give his full 100% customer service to my family and I. As I kept seeing him going to all his other tables and being really attentive with them. Most of his table were white folks. At that point I felt discriminated only because I am Mexican, I don't deserve good customer service?

We went together several years ago and ordered a pizza for the both of us and customized it to half pepperoni and half pineapple. The taste was great but we both came down with food poisoning shortly thereafter. Without getting into too much detail, we both were waking up hourly in the night having to go to the bathroom while our bodies ""rejected"" the pizza we ate. I've had food poisoning before but never this bad. Unfortunately, we will NEVER return to this location due to the horrible experience we had after the meal. The only reason I don't give it one star is because we actually remember the pizza tasting pretty decent and the setting and service wasn't anything to criticize.

This place is located on the second level of the Fashion Valley Mall next to the foodcourt and across from the AMC Theater. They have an outdoor patio for dining and a bar inside. I've been here a few times. Each visit is a different experience. This past visit was about an hour or so before closing on New Year's Eve with my friend. After doing some well deserved shopping for ourselves after Christmas, we decided to dine here. There was no wait, so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly. She also gave me a compliment on liking my Star Wars hat. Since we were famished, we already knew what we wanted to order. She took our drink orders first. I tried their Mango flavored iced tea. It was very sweet. As I was getting ready to separate our bread plate to give to my friend, I noticed that our plates had crumbs on it. I didn't know where our server went, so we got the attention of one of the male server's. He was working in the front host area. We asked for new plates. As he took our plates away, he said he will be back with new plates. He didn't return. When our server delivered our bread, I told her about the plates. She came back with freshly washed plates that were nice and warm. We ordered their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings as an  appetizer and the Wild Mushroom Pizza with Wheat  Whole Grain Crust. The dumplings were steamed to perfection with popping flavors of ginger. It was really yummy! The Wild Mushroom Pizza was also very tasty! We shared the appetizer and the pizza.

And if you want to make it a full meal: Tiramisu - also amazing. House side salad - again, also amazing.  If you order ahead by phone, they remember you, because I guess your past orders come up on their computer. They always ask me if I will be ordering the chicken piccata because they know I am a chicken piccata addict. And they don't tell me that I have a problem or judge me or anything for it. They just ask if I would like to pick that up at their curbside service, and whether I would like their insanely good bread and utensils. And then I say, ""yes & yes.""

Andee S.,"Bermuda Dunes, United States",124,105,70,2.0,8/7/2014,"I was so disappointed with our experience at this CPK.  One of the great things about CPK is their consistency.  However this particular location leaves much to be desired. First, let me say, our server Colby was awesome.  He was fast, courteous and responsive. Shortly after we ordered our food, we noticed that there was a stream of ants crawling across the windowsill which was really really dirty.  This windowsill looked as if it had not been cleaned in weeks.  There were literally dead insects on the windowsill covered in dust in addition to the ants.  As soon as we noticed the ants, we asked if we could move, and Colby was super in accommodating us and helping us get moved to our new table. After we moved, someone came and reset the two person booth that we had just left.  They then proceeded to seat another couple at the booth.  We were confused because we noticed that the windowsill had not actually been cleaned.  After a few minutes, those people also requested to be moved.  Even after both parties mentioned the ants, no one came and cleaned the booth windowsill.  We had to sit at the table nearby the whole time, knowing that the ants were still running wild. While Colby did an excellent job accommodating us and serving us, at no time did a manager come to speak with us or apologize.  Nor did anyone do the same for the other party who had to be moved.  Additionally, as we left, we mentioned the problem to the manager standing at the host stand and still received no apology.  In fact after we mentioned in, we walked around the corner where we could still see inside and the manager never left the host station to even investigate. As always, the food was delicious.  We had the Mushroom, Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza and split the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  Both were really good, and up to par with our regular CPK experiences. And I highly recommend the Agave Mojito, it was superb.   I don't think I will ever patronize this CPK again, as it was clear that cleanliness is just not important to the staff in general.  I would probably have given this review only 1 star if it weren't for the great service from Colby.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=140

I'd highly recommend the avocado club roll appetizer, unless you're health-conscious, in which case I think you're in the wrong place anyway! Definitely a place to come when you've got a bit of time, since it gets busy and parking can be tricky depending on time of day.

Our server, Michael, greeted us in a timely manner and was friendly. He made some great suggestions, and seemed very knowledgeable. We ordered a couple soft drinks and a couple half salads. The half salads, priced around $9, are plenty big for an average person like myself. I had the Chicken with the peanut sauce dressing. It was fantastic. We also ordered a salad to go for my sister back home. She loved it as well. They also brought out warm bread with olive oil, which was great and a nice touch you don't see at many chain restaurants.

Spicy tomato sauce, luguini noodles, and Cajun chicken with a Coors Light on the side. The manager on duty suggested I try some new Orange County brewed beer called Devils Stone or something weird and that was the worst alcoholic beverage I've ever tasted. Overall, the food was great.

Chris S.,"San Diego, United States",19,56,,5.0,18/6/2015,"Had dinner here last night with friends before catching a movie next-door and we were seated immediately and greeted by a pleasant and very professional young man named Walter. We explained that we had a little bit of a time problem and were going to see a movie next-door and he indicated that they sold tickets in the restaurant to the movie theater for only eight dollars which is an incredible bargain that I did not know about! Of course we said yes and all of our food came out in a very timely and professional fashion. All was great until the main course came, and my friend bit into the pizza and found an alien piece of what initially appeared to be glass but was just a hard piece of clear plastic. Our server, Walter, handled it very professionally and immediately a lovely female manager was tableside and took care of the issue in the most professional manner I can imagine! She offered to replace the pizza which we declined, and offered us free dessert which we accepted, and when the bill came, the manager had deducted much more than was necessary or expected which elevates the service level of this restaurant to pretty much amazing! I have been in the restaurant business for 35 years and I was exceptionally impressed by the way that this whole and generally rather minor problem was handled with utmost efficiency and grace! The food over all is quite satisfactory to exceptional, and the prices are far more fair than the adjacent and overrated and always packed cheesecake factory. I recommend this place to anyone for a fair price and very good meal with great service and plenty of selection!

Evonne L.,"Sunnyvale, United States",137,499,,1.0,31/5/2010,"Dear CPK,  What was with the BIG ASS BUG that was in my pizza? Not cool!!! I'm tryng to be reasonable here in recognizing that sometimes there are flies or gnats inside any restaurant, but we all know that was no fly. Whatever it was had an inch long span, complete with long antennae, 6 stringy legs, a bloated thorax, and impressive triangular wings.  And what's with that thing being at the BOTTOM of the pear and gorgonzola pizza? I was pushing that shit around like it was a piece of curled up lettuce the whole time! It wasn't  until I was feebly trying to  ""unroll"" the ""piece of lettuce"" to put on a piece of pizza crust, and suddenly realized it was not a lettuce leaf...it was a large insect lightly covered in dressing and slightly curled up from the heat of the pizza. Good to know I ate nearly all the pizza and shared a buncha pieces of it with 3 of my friends before this wonderful discovery. I hope that little guy didn't have a friend that I am already digesting. That's gotta be a violation of some health and safety code.  Anyway, it was cool that the manager did the best that she could after seeing the sickening sight. She gave a long apology (speculating that the large bug came from outside due to a produce order, but not from inside of the CPK restaurant and emphasizing that "" this never happens"").  It's just a shame that it did happen and even if the bug came from Iraq, the bottom line is it doesn't belong on a pizza. Still, the manager offered to comp 1/2 of the meal. She also offered us dessert to make up for our little friend, but unfortuantely no one was really in the mood to eat anymore food after seeing (and tasting) such a sight. When asked what else CPK could do for us, we suggested comping us a drink but apparently, it's against CPK policy to comp alcoholic beverages. Ironic because at that point, you'd probably need a drink to forget you were chowing down on bug-pizza.  Additionally, the wait for this CPK is notoriously long and service is usually less than amazing because it's so busy. We waited a long time to get a response from the staff for the bug and then an even longer time to get our checks (triple slap in the face). I know no one maliciously intended the bug to be in the pizza, and the manager and waitress seemed like nice people. However, that experience was just nasty, and I don't think I'd ever come back.  PS- I am further embarassed that I was the one who suggested you to my friends and saddened that you will be my first 1 star review on Yelp!

So shouldn't there be more of the good stuff?).  I'm cheap when it comes to eating out (who isn't on a budget these days) and my friend and I were able to split a pizza (6 small slices) and app and be fine while walking out the door paying about $12/per person - not the cheapest but not breaking the bank either. I was UBER excited to see my newest favorite vodka on the menu (Veev, which is an acai vodka - to die for!).  So of course I had to have their Strawberry basil martini ($8) and for a buck more I decided to add the extra shot of vodka and it was well worth the price.  I will absolutely get this drink again and will be making it at home as well!!  Thanks for the great drink idea CPK.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=200

Although their delicious pizzas can be tempting, their salads are equally good and filling. I really like coming here for lunches and light dinners! I recommend eating here instead of the alarmingly overpriced Cheesecake factory that's also present in the mall.

I'd give 5 stars if I liked the location better. it's in a mall so parking sucks, and it's by a movie theatre so its going to be crowded and it's a family place so often times your seated by a family of 6 with kids yelling and parents who look like they just stopped caring and need a xanax so they just let them cry and throw crayons . those things can be avoided if you don't come on  weekend nights and try to stay away from prime dinner times (7-8 p.m) during the week.  also the place needed to be swept, we had to switch tables b/c they sat us at an obviously dirty table. and it was really cold in there.  Basically come for the food- because it IS good, try to sit at a table tucked away from booths, or at the bar. oh , 1 more thing ( i have come here so much I knew the bartender he told me this....) the drinks aren't that strong. it's a lot of juice. i wouldn't spend the 10 bucks on a drink with 1.5 ounces of cheap alcohol and 90% sugar and juice. there wine selection is pretty solid too. not your usual cheap stuff, but actual decent wines (they carry dreaming tree) or try a wine flight. 3 little glasses of white or red. a neat way to try different things. nothing super fancy- like what you'd see at a wine bar, but seems like a step above what your usual chain restaurants carry. kendall jackson anyone? I havent had the dessert yet ,but it looks really good! i'll be back here, its my go to restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=200

When we brought it to Megan's attention she tried to tell us that ""I'm sure that there was only ONE hair in the pizza! Usually there is only ONE.""  We all could not believe she said that to us! After letting the manager know what she had said, he too said that was an unacceptable response! After bringing us the bill minus the price of the ""hairy"" pizza we found ANOTHER hair in a different pizza! When we pointed that out to her as we were paying and she was clearing the plates, she RUDELY said ""Well that's why I'm taking these away!"" Megan needs a good lesson on customer service and how to apologize for mistakes  and not be SNOOTY about it! If we were trying to get a free meal, I would have insisted on a totally comped meal instead of paying the $88 with the $15 pizza off! Definitely  no tip for that BIOTCH!!

When I moved to Mission Valley in San Diego I was psyched to see a CPK right in the Fashion Valley Mall.  We went in and had a fantastic meal.  Every time I have dined here the service has always been consistent and fast.  The food never disappoints, and the portions are great. They just added a new crab cake to their menu a couple of months ago, called the Baja Crab cake and it's hands down the best crab cake I've had in San Diego, and trust me I eat a lot of crab cakes. Their pizzas are really delicious.  If it doesn't have pork on it (damn allergies) I'll try it.   My favorite pizzas are as follows: Margarita on thin crust Thai Chicken Greek Pizza Four Cheese with sundried tomatoes aaaand the one with the pears.  The name escapes me now and I know you're think ""umm, pears, really?""  Trust me it's delicious. CPK can pretty much stick anything onto a crust and make it good.

I have to give this place 3 stars only because of our waiter.  The food was pretty terrible, but our waiter was fun.  I wish I could remember his name.  He was super friendly and took my sarcasm (and even gave me some back!) without feeling insulted.  He seemed to enjoy our table, and he was quite a trooper.  So for him, I give this place 3-stars.  Also, it's pretty clean.  Clean is good.  But the food here is awful.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=220

He ducked down into the fridge below the cash register, opened up a container and shoved something in his mouth. Then he just stood there chewing his food. He was actually supposed to get more information about a food item. He was literally in the middle of taking my order. I was literally face to face with him, waiting for him to finish his food. I didn't say anything, because in my head he was diabetic and going to go into shock if he did not eat at that moment. But realistically, I think he was disrespectfully and disgustingly eating someone Else's food, in the middle of taking my order and disrespecting me. I am not huge into needing to be respected, but this was beyond just being ""unprofessional"". What other things could this staff person be doing, that he shouldn't be doing at this restaurant. MANAGEMENT  Good. 4 stars. Professional. Comped my food without me asking.

I've been to this and other locations before and as with most chains, the food is pretty consistent from location to location. New to me, they have this satisfaction guarantee posted on the menu.  The actually encourage people to try new things by letting them know they can send them back and go back to their old standby if they don't like it.   In spite of this, my wife and I split a Thai Chicken Pizza and a small  chopped salad-old standbys.  They were as good as the first time I ever ordered them. The kids all ordered off the kids menu and seemed uniformly happy.  My father joined us.  He had the Cobb salad and fish tacos.  He liked the salad but not the tacos.  He prefers Rubios so that gives everyone an idea of his yardstick. Other than the crowds, I like the place.  They have some really unique pizza combinations and have expanded the menu beyond pizza and salad to include fish and meat.  Give it a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=260

They have interesting menu item descriptions, but when you get your food, you become forever scarred of the boring flavor that fills your mouth. The flavors in their pizzas and pastas matches only that of oven-made meals from your home. Their food just doesn't taste as fresh as they claim.  Thus, the food is just okay. They don't give me that ""mmm... soo good"" feeling, and I would much rather dine at the Cheesecake Factory. The service at this CPK is average and not really up to par with other chain restaurants.

I have to give her credit, she kept her cool under the pressure, and she was doing a great job hustling to try to keep up with everything. The 2/5 rating is for the management letting this happen.  As it turns out, people were on breaks/lunches, and they came back about 30 minutes after we got there.  Why would the manager allow everyone to leave at the same time for their break/lunch?  Why wouldn't you stagger them so there is always sufficient staff on the floor?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=240

Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, United States",83,49,9,2.0,19/2/2013,"Went to CPK for a birthday celebration. I was pretty satisfied with the food and drink, but the environment and service were lacking a lot of luster. PROS: Will do separate checks for a large group, Food was good (4 out of 5), the roasted veggie salad was a nice alternative to boring, plain, or fatty salads you usually find at restaurants these days.  CONS: Service was inconsistent, we got our food after the rest of our party was basically done eating theirs. Also, it's in a mall (which I try to avoid).  And it was crowded and we were sat late, even with reservations.  --------------------------------- DRINK:  I was in the mood for a beer, but there weren't any great selections - I think they had three beers on tap; Red Trolley was one, but none of them made me even a little excited.  The birthday guest's drink of choice is always a Long Island Iced Tea, so I had one of those as well.  Always a good choice if you think a corporate place isn't going to pour the drinks well, because it's pretty much all alcohol.  It was a decent drink, though the bartender didn't add enough ice so she topped it off with coke (it's supposed to be the smallest of splashes).  But, at $8, it was a good choice (I was honestly expecting $10 or $12). GROUPS: Even though we had reservations at 7:00 for 8, we weren't seated until 7:30. The upside of going to this place as a group is that they'll do separate checks, so you don't have to split the bill at the end.  The downside is that they still charged us the group rate for gratuity (18%).  I typically tip 18-20% for good and great service, but I didn't want to give them an 18% tip after that visit. FOOD: The food was good, Shawn got the Carnitas & Habanero pizza, and I had the roasted veggie half salad.  A half salad is just right for the standard person (girl) - get a full salad if you plan on sharing with someone.  The roasted veggies were done well - eggplant, peppers, artichoke hearts - and also avocado and a few other things.  Pretty tasty!  Shawn said the pizza was good too.  He and his brother love spicy food, and the pizza came with a habanero salsa/dipping sauce, which they said was pretty good (and actually on the spicy side.) SERVICE: The biggest negative of the night was that all the food came out for everyone else in our group, and Shawn Michael and I did not receive our food.  The server came back around and apologized to us, said there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that it was all her fault, and that our food would be out soon.  My salad was delivered at about the point when everyone else was halfway through their food, and Shawn's pizza came after everyone else had finished their meals (and I was nearly done with my salad).  We're pretty patient people, and recognize that mistakes are made, and for the most part are pretty forgiving.  The food was still good; he enjoyed his pizza and I my salad, but when a server admits that it was totally their fault, that they messed the order up, I expect the best approach is to take a portion of the price off the bill, or comp a drink or bring a free appetizer or something.  Shawn and I were both surprised when our check came and it was still full priced (and had the mandatory 18% gratuity included).   We weren't expecting it for free, because we still benefited from eating and enjoying the meal, but the server should account for the inconvenience and the inaccuracy of their service.  For Shawn's sake I wanted to say something, or at least tip a little bit less, but he didn't want to make it into a big deal so we ended up just paying the bill and leaving.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280
Scott R.,"Escondido, United States",0,3,5,2.0,27/2/2015,"Stopped in to have a quick lunch.  While waiting for them to open, I browsed the menu outside on the wall. I picked the Italian deli sandwich for my lunch. Was seated by the very courteous staff and browsed the menu I was handed. That sandwich was not on their menu.  I walked out with my server ""Calvin"" to show him the menu error and he pointed it out to the manager.  They did offer to attempt to make the sandwich for me, but I didn't want to be a problem.  So I went with my second choice, the Italian chopped salad which they charge ~ $15 for.  When I got it I was shocked at the lack of meat.  They probably had about three slices of salami cut into strips and about a half of a cup of cubed turkey meat.  I polished the ""full"" sized salad in not time and could of had another.  I will admit that it did taste very good, but not worth the price.  I'd peg this as 2x too expensive and will not get again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280
Robert S.,"Los Angeles, United States",34,557,,2.0,6/5/2010,"This review is my second review of a CPK location, however, very little has changed since my original review of a LA location. This location is at the Mission Valley mall area.  The first and most important thing to remember about ordering pizza from this chain is that you have to specifically request thin crust. If you don't, then without exception, I have had bad pizza here with thick, undercooked crust. When you request thin crust, they simply take the original crust and press it a second time, giving you a larger diameter pizza, probably with more toppings.  This chain has some interesting sounding pizzas but for the most part, they have taken conventional dinner entrees and just put them on a pizza.  The conventional cheese pizza that I had here recently was worse than the last time I tried it, with a more generic and bland mozzarella and a more generic and bland tomato sauce. All I can think regarding this terrible pizza was that they must have geared this pizza to children and kept it horribly bland to avoid offending any picky youngsters.  Again, the best pizza that they served was their salad based pizza (both with and without the salad on top). This pizza is a white or sauce less pizza with more interesting cheeses and some more flavorful spices. The crust is the same on all of the pizzas and, when thin enough, is mildly flavorful, raised with some elasticity.  The salad with Parmesan shavings and chopped tomatoes that comes on the salad pizza is surprisingly good both on its own and with the pizza. It consistently has a fresh lettuce and flavorful dressing as well as surprisingly abundant freshly shaved Parmesan cheese.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280

Angela S.,"San Diego, United States",13,44,3,5.0,31/3/2010,"My first time at CPK. What took me so long? I never went because I assumed that all they served were pizza (duh), I assumed that it would be really pricey and that the pizza would be generic and wouldn't live up to my expectations. Mind as well order Dominos right? I tried the frozen CPK pizzas from Vons, but that does not do justice for the REAL and FRESH thing they serve. WOW, so many pizza options, I got the white mushroom pizza on a thin crust. So delicious. I had one and tried to tame myself afterwards. So rich and flavorful. If I ever go to italy, I will measure up how their pizza compares. That is how good it was. Next time, I think I won't get thin crust, because with the amount of cheese, I think it made the crust a little chewy and soggy. I like it crunchy, it wasn't able to hold my toppings. I also got the half- grilled vegetable salad. soooo amazing! ate the whole thing. yummy eggplant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=300

Linh N.,"San Diego, United States",133,223,131,3.0,21/3/2010,"Surprisingly, today was my first time at CPK, even though I am a San Diego Native. I don't know... I just never had the urge to go there. Anyhow, finally at there for lunch today. At first glance at the menu, nothing really caught my eye and looked too appealing. I didn't want anything heavy and really wasn't in the mood for pizza. I opted for an appetizer and went with the avocado egg rolls.  The avocado egg rolls were pretty good. There wasn't a whole lot of avocado in it, so I'm surprised at the name on this dish. The outside was crispy which was yummy. My husband ordered some chicken pizza.... it looked alright... he said it was good, but I personally didn't try it. He did mention that Sammy's woodfired is better though.  My friend ordered some tequila pasta thing... now THAT was pretty darn good.  I thought the prices were on the high-average side. The restaurant was busy  and bustling. I didn't find anything too unique about the food itself.... so not sure that I would come back on my own suggestion. They definitely have the location as an advantage here, because being located right at the mall and across from the theater - they are bound to get the foot traffic. I think there are plenty of other places with better food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=300
S L.,"Los Angeles, United States",28,173,,4.0,22/2/2011,"When I lived in San Diego and craved CPK, I ate at the restaurant off Nobel (off the 5 freeway). However, perusing through sales racks at the mall can make a guy hungry. Being that this is one of my favorite chains, I was introduced to this CPK at Fashion Valley Mall. It was kind of tucked away in a corner on the second story of this complex and thus I was hesitant to go in, primarily because I thought the quality of the food would be lower given the relatively poor location. WRONG!!! It's a chain. Chain's operate like assembly lines and thus the product, no matter the location, is generally the same (or at least very similar). For example, In-n-out burgers. I've ordered 3 at a time and they all tasted the same. I've eaten at 3 different In-n-out's and they've all tasted the same. Sorry for the tangent but I'm just trying to make a point. The food was the same: AWESOME!!! I've been here with a couple of friends and have actually tried something outside of my favorites (will be listed below). Sit back and enjoy the ride. Environment: Like I said before, this restaurant is on the smaller side and I anticipated not only a smaller dining area but a more claustrophobic experience. NOPE. The layout was different than other restaurants I've been to but the space between tables that allows for intimacy was still there. Not as many windows as it's sister restaurant closer to La Jolla but there was ample lighting. Probably not as much traffic in this restaurant given that there were fewer tables and thus fewer employees. Waiters/Waitresses: I remember coming here with a buddy of mine, a CPK virgin. I had talked up this restaurant because of the variety and my favorites. As soon as we sat down, he shouted ""I freaking love this place!"" I looked up from my menu and was just about to ask him which entree he was looking at only to find that his menu was still on the table, closed. He was admiring the people around us. More specifically, staring at the ladies at the neighboring tables. I HAD to take a look myself. Let me just say that he has good taste. My buddy probably didn't pick up the menu for another 10 minutes. Just people watching....including the waitresses. Need I say more? Food: I've copied an excerpt from a past posting and pasted it on the bottom of this review. On this particular day, I had the BBQ chicken pizza. Apparently, ""Our most popular pizza, introduced in our first restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1985. Barbecue sauce, smoked Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses, BBQ Chicken, sliced red onions and cilantro."" Sounds great right? It is. I don't quite understand it but BBQ sauce gets more spicy when you cook it. I LOVE SPICY FOOD! The chicken pieces are cooked well; not too dry, not raw. There's a perfect combination and ratio of onions and chicken which doesn't overpower the BBQ sauce. Instead, they work synergistically to create this wonderful flavor explosion in your mouth. I'm sorry for my painfully nerdy way of describing food but that's my forte. Recommendation: EAT! Where do I start? The bread is pretty good. Only problem is that the butter comes right out of the fridge and does not spread easily. Appetizers are terrific. Had several of them before but the favorite, by far, had to be the spinach artichoke dip. Perfect blend of cheese, spinach, and artichoke hearts. Creamy and tasty. With every bite of the dip, you feel some spinach get stuck between your teeth. But, because it's so perfectly prepared and cooked, one swipe of your tongue or finger and the situation resolves itself. Dang. Now I'm hungry, just thinking about it. Sometimes the chips are a little salty. If that's the case, ask for more bread and use the dip as a spread. Creative. I know. I've sampled different manifestations of this dish at multiple restaurants and not one can come as close to perfection as CPK has managed to do. For entrees, the favorites are california pizza (sweet and thin [but not sicilian-pizza-thin] crust, melted cheese, creamy mayonnaise-like sauce, fresh lettuce, crispy bits of  chopped bacon, and thick slices of avocado), thai chicken pizza, and chicken tequila fettucini (rich tequila flavor with hint of lime and cream. For all you alcoholics, you CANNOT have the tequila on the side!). Have tried others but we almost always order these. Only problem with the California pizza is that you can't really save it. Avocado does not do well overnight. Go ahead, prove me wrong. For dessert, I've tried the cranberry cheesecake. Basically, it's normal cheesecake with cranberry swirls and an Oreo crust. Wasn't bad. Remember, I don't normally do desserts.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=300

She said she was getting reviewed by the big managers that were in town. Really? Giving employee reviews during the dinner rush while you already started to wait on customers? That was strange. Sure enough, noticed 3 other servers, either at tables inside the restaurant or on the patio getting reviews. Little tacky I thought. Don't you have a back office or something? Pizzas were good, just not as amazing or ""wow"" as I had remembered. Lettuce wrap appetizer was good. Getting Rick Rolled inside the restaurant...classic. They did have a (what I thought was new) was a try a new pizza guarantee. Try something new and if you don't like it, they will make your ""old stand by favorite"" for free. Thought that was nice, although I'd like to think most places would do that, they just don't advertise it. I am torn on rushing back for another go at dinner. We got these blind coupons that that expire at the end of June. Come back in, manager opens the coupon and you find out what you win. Trips, hotel stays, cash, discounts.... might be worth going back in just for that, even for a drink and appetizer.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=320
l k.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,9,,1.0,3/5/2008,"I grew up in Los Angeles, went to undergrad in Orange County, and now I am here in beautiful San Diego for grad school.  One of my biggest pet peeves about San Diego is that the chains here are generally of much worse quality then in LA or Orange County.  I have probably been to 10 different CPK's in my life and eaten there a thousand times. Other then the ones Ive gone to many times, the others all just blend in together because of how consistent they are.  This one stands out as being awful Please spend the extra few bucks and wait if you have to and just go to Cheesecake Factory downstairs (which is pretty on par with any others youve been to) Service at this CPK was pretty bad, my glass was stained, they filled up my soft drink half way, it looked empty, the salad that I usually get looked unfresh, and it smelled like a homeless person where I was sitting.  I love CPK but would never go back to this one.  I pray that I just went on a horrible day, but nothing about how the staff acted made it seem out of the ordinary.  If you have never been to CPK I highly recommend it , just not this one.

Miki L.,"Long Beach, United States",274,155,774,2.0,28/9/2010,"Normally, I am a huge fan of CPK, but this location is pretty poor quality!  After having a huge event at the Hard Rock the night before, my friend decided to celebrate the day of her actual birthday with a more mellow dinner at CPK. Four of the six members of our party arrived at 7:30 and we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress took about hmmm... 8 minutes or so to come over, introduce herself and get our drink orders... pretty simple... just water. It was another 8 minutes or so before the water came. We told her we would wait for a few minutes to see if the other members of our party would arrive before we ordered anything. In the meantime I stepped outside, made a quick call to my beau and realized we shouldn't wait to order our food. After I returned it was another 10 minutes or so before the waitress returned to our table, despite having visited the table next to ours about 5 times (no joke)... our menus were closed and we were staring at her, which typically is a sign that someone is ready to order. When she finally arrived we ordered the Mediterranean small plate as an appetizer for 3 people & requested the bread be brought out as well. I wish she would have mentioned that its definitely too small to share for 3 people, because when the food arrived no less than 15 minutes later it was like a bite of pita, salad & hummus for each of us. While we were munching away, our waitress came over to us and let us know that she would no longer be taking care of our table for the evening and that a second waitress would be helping us. This was great since we were already annoyed that she had been soooo ridiculously slow. The second waitress took the order from 3 members of our party, and I waited till my beau and his friend arrived about 10 minutes later.  When the guys arrived, the food was still not out (the salad & soup appetizers), so we put in our orders with the waitress and asked for a refill on the bread. She told us, Im sorry I believe we are out, she took a quick peek at the kitchen area and to her surprise stated, ""oh, i guess we got some more."" First off, are you serious? CPK ran out of bread?? When it arrived, it was cold.. I mean not room temperature like it normally is, but cold to the touch.. like frozen. We told our waitress and she exclaimed ""It always comes cold, if you want it toasted then you needed to ask prior."" After asking her to touch the bread she realized the kitchen must have taken it from the freezer or the fridge before cutting it and sending it out. She brought the bread back to the kitchen to be toasted and it arrived about 10 minutes later. The food was nothing to be discussed as it tasted exactly the same as I have had a dozen times before. At the end of our meal the waitress asked if anyone was interested in dessert. I felt sort of pressured as she asked like 10 times... luckily, she did bring my friend, the birthday girl, an ice cream sundae, but she didn't even bother to join in as we sung happy birthday to her.  Oddly, I ate at the Temecula CPK the night prior to this incident, and I can say that this was the poorest and slowest service, by multiple waitresses, that I have ever received at a CPK.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=320

lori C.,"San Diego, United States",0,23,1,2.0,9/9/2011,"Everything was going great. We put in our order (two pizzas). It took a little longer than I expected but no worries at this point. Towards the middle of our meal we asked the waitress (Betty) for the check as we needed to get back to work. We waited, and waited, and waited...no check. Finally my husband had to leave and I stayed behind to settle the check. Finally after another 10mins our waitress shows up with the check stating she forgot about us. I open the bill and there is another persons visa check card and bill in the bill folder. As I was getting up to alert our waitress she realized what she had done and was at our table to correct her mistake. I had never seen her move so fast. Still no bill for me at this point. Finally my bill comes and I ask for a dessert to take home and a take home box for my unfinished pizza. Easy enough right? I had also requested to take home the salsa that came on the side. I even offered to pay for extra. No problem says Betty. She came back and had boxed up my pizza but said my piece cake was not ready yet. I examined the pizza,  no extra salsa..just what had been left on my plate. No bill again at this point because she had to now recalculate for the dessert. Needless to say after waiting another 5mins or so I had to get up and go to the front of the restaurant to get my bill. As I was doing so the cake in a box showed up. Unfortunately whoever decided to box the cake also put the sauce (which comes with the cake) on the cake instead of in a different container. Now my cake will be soggy unless I plan on eating it in the next 10mins which was not the case. Now I am once again waiting...this time for a new piece of cake. I am sorry to say this Betty but your waitressing skills need work and so does your sensitivity, or, lack there of, towards your customers. I usually tip at least 20%..not this time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=340
Teej T.,"Urbana, United States",668,663,20,3.0,6/10/2007,"I have many mixed feelings about you, CPK. First off, if you were not a chain, I'd be more intrigued, because in a vaguely hip, annoyingly upscale way you do try to reinvent two cliches, California cuisine, and Chic Pizza Spots.  Unfortunately, you're a chain, so in the same way that Starbuck's originally had an interesting take on the coffee shop, your corporate touch has finessed all the originality out of the experience.  So boo on you. Now, secondly, your food is stylish, and the pizzas will be tasty, and the spinach artichoke dip will be wonderfully awesome, but it is all expensive, and far more than necessary.  While I feel racially awkward ordering the white pizza (Will Dad think I'm excluding him?  Will Mom think I'm trying to hard to blend with half the family?), it is delicious--and with added bacon, mushrooms, and alfredo sauce, I know I'm shortening my lifespan accordingly so I don't have to feel too uncomfortable.  However, should it really be around $15?  Nah. Your Oktoberfest beer was wonderful, and your peach/raspberry/whatever Torani syrup you have available-infused iced tea is lovely, but still pricey.  So you give again with flavour, and you take away with cost.  Oh CPK, when will you stop taunting me with your uneven array of tasty and costly? And finally, what makes you lose favour in my eyes, oh CPK, is the fact that you are located within that most bourgeois of malls south of UTC, Fashion Valley.  This also means that you are the Mecca for any near by high school.  This shouldn't be a problem, but if you are a high school teacher, it means a HIGH degree of pleasant but slightly awkward student/teacher conversations outside of school. Student: HEEEEEY!!!!! Teacher: Hi there! (pause) Student: So, it's um weird to see you outside of school. Teacher: Um...yeah, totally weird. Student: I don't know, I just thought all my teachers lived at school or whatever. Teacher: Er...well, um, ....I don't? Student: Yeah... Teacher: I have to ...um...be over here now. So, CPK is relatively tasty and edgy, but the edginess is dulled by corporate America, the tasty is blunted by the priceyness, and the location makes me feel occasionally uncomfortable.

Nadine N.,"Vancouver, Canada",186,724,295,2.0,6/5/2007,"I like CPK. I especially like the roasted eggplant pizza and the roasted vegetable salad...at other CPKs, not the one at Fashion Valley. Their roasted veggie salad sucked. The vegetables were burnt and/or flavorless. Don't they have some sort of corporate standard? Isn't that the whole point of chains? You go to any one and the food tastes the same regardless of where you are?  Service could use plenty of improvement too.

Vin F.,"San Diego, United States",125,138,2,3.0,7/12/2007,"I went there with K. after a movie at Fashion Valley, primarily because it was late, it was open, and K. said she was starving.  If I'm a snob about any food, it's probably pizza (I do realize that's somewhat oxymoronic).  But at 11pm in San Diego, it was that or Seven-Eleven. This chain just reeks of that corporate feel - it's just one step above a food court.  The pizza was actually not bad - we had the vegetarian, and the vegetables were very fresh, including the Japanese eggplant, which was an interesting addition.  It would have been a lot more interesting if it had been larger than an hors d'oeuvre, or at least as cheap as one.   We also ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, which had nicely flavored chicken lying, unfortunately, on something that resembled a compost pile.  I'm not quite sure when tossing a couple of mandarin orange slices into a pile of head lettuce suddenly qualified a salad as ""Chinese"" but somehow I doubt that this is what they're eating in Bejing. The problem with CPK isn't that it's bad, but that it's not.  It's another one of those overpriced, underachieving corporate entities that's just good enough to keep you from avoiding it, but you always leave with that vague sense of having been taken for a ride.  An expensive and unsatisfying one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=340

Mike W.,"San Diego, United States",10,13,,4.0,31/3/2010,"I love this place, but I believe it is really over priced, especially for something like pizza. but the staff, food, and restaurant are great. so If you don't mind dropping a few extra dollars, then this is the place. if you are on a budget, go anywhere else, its just pizza.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360
Chelsea E.,"San Diego, United States",2,21,1,4.0,11/10/2009,"I'm seriously surprised how under rated this place is. I haven't never been let down by a meal here. I worked in fashion valley for four years, never got sick of this place and still seek it out. My go to dish is the chicken Cesar sandwich with tortilla soup. I've had pizza and pasta here as well as salads. Everything was pretty good. If you're in fashion valley go here it's cheaper than cheese cake factory, quieter, and has a shorter wait. Unfortunately you will most likely wait almost a half hour around dinner time, I generally go to the location in La Jolla because of this.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360

Amber G.,"San Diego, United States",27,45,11,4.0,29/5/2009,"I've been here twice, once in the fall semester after my first final, and once in the spring semester after my first final.  You could say it's a tradition.  Both times, the food has been delicious and the service has been great.  CPK might not have the ambiance of a smaller, individually run restaurant, but you can always bet the food is going to be good.  The first time we came to this one, my friends and I had a ""no drinking until finals are over"" rule, but the second time we were like, ""we need a drink.""  Since I hadn't had a drink in months, I was hoping my dirty martini would be perfect.  Unfortunately, it was a bit strong.  I'm sure some people would appreciate that (more bang for your buck) but I just wanted a lovely martini to nurse through lunch; not one that made me wince after swallowing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360

MRenee B.,"San Diego, United States",0,16,2,3.0,29/6/2013,"I have been coming here regularly for years, and I've always had great service until recently. I came in alone, on a Friday night to grab a bite before my movie started. I TOTALLY get that it's packed/crazy and you can expect a wait, but I also know it's open seating at the bar. In the past, 'in the bar' included the tall bistro tables back in the bar area. There were a few open, so I went and sat at one, only to be told that wasn't bar seating and I needed to move(all the times in the past, I told it was bar seating...confusing...). Ok...so the only place left was a seat at the end of the bar right in the 'to go' order pickup area. It's a small, short counter with 2 chairs, and you have a view directly of the kitchen/GARBAGE CAN, etc....def. the WORST seat in the house (I'm actually surprised/ashamed they will even allow people to dine there, literally at eye level w/ the garbage can, mops, cash register/break room, etc. RIGHT in front of you). BUT--I did, b/c again it was my choice to come on a Friday evening rush and not wait the 30 min for a table in the main dining hall. I wasn't excited about my 'view,' but, I love the food/service so was prepared to deal with it. Right when I sat down, a lady also sat down next to me. NEITHER of us were approached by anyone. Finally after about 10 min I asked some random guy walking by if we can even order here? He looked annoyed, and was like, 'uhhh, sure.....hold on.' The lady and I looked at each other like...'seriously?!' So he comes back maybe 5 mintues later and quickly just takes our drink order, not asking if we're eating, etc....and rushes away before we can say we actually want to eat. Also, neither of us was EVER given WATER or even offered water! It was litearlly 20 min later when I finally grabbed him to put in a food order. Then another woman ended up coming to actually give the check (served in a water glass?)....it was painfully obvious I, and my seat mate were just a total pain in the butt for them. We both ordered and paid as much as a normal 'diner,' but were treated more horribly than second class citizens. It was sooooo disappointing, this is always my go-to spot before a movie, but I will NEVER sit at that spot again. I felt like me ordering and giving them my money/service was a pain, my seat mate agreed it was close to the worst service we've ever had.  Sorry you were annoyed to have our money and business...next time we may just take it elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360
Madeline S.,"La Mesa, United States",64,39,,3.0,20/5/2009,So delicious. I really recommend this place. The thai chicken pizza is one of my favorites and the bbq salad they have. Oh man.. So good. You can also take it to go and walk across to AMC theater and watch a movie. They let you bring it in. Never been to any other location but this one so I cant vouch for the others. Make sure they dont burn your crust. They tend to do this sometimes. Make sure your pizza is right before you leave if you get take out. They put pepperoni on my vegetarian boyfriend's pizza and he didnt get lunch that day because he didnt have enough time to wait for another. But when they do their job right it is DELICIOUS!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360
Teo K.,"San Diego, United States",0,2,,1.0,25/9/2007,"I like to stop in to CPK now and then for a BBQ Chicken salad and Tequilla pasta. These are like comfort foods for me. I will never again go to this loction again though. I went on a busy night and the place was not staffed well. I took this into consideration as I waited for our server. After I ordered a bottled beer I waited ten minutes for the server to return only to not have her take our food order. I grabed her attention before she left and let her know that we ready and gave her our order. 30 min. later we got our food. The regular sized salad was served on the large oval plate as normal, but it was barely  an inch high in the middle as it sloaped down to the sides of the plate. Now, I've been coming to CPK for over 10 years now and was sure that this was far less than the normal portion. My server was once again nowhere to be found (even though the place was now less than half full) I asked to see a manager. He told me that the portion size was correct and made no apologies for the wait. He in no way wanted to take the dish back or make amends. He walked away and I walked out food untouched and bill unpaid. 5 min. later I had a lovely overpriced meal at Cheesecake Factory. I have since gone to the La jolla loction and was happy with both the service and meal. The Fashion Valley loction is no longer an option.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=360
Kari S.,"San Diego, United States",78,385,43,4.0,6/2/2008,I have always loved CPK pizza! My DH isn't a huge fan so I don't get to go very often. My mom and I were shopping at Fashion Valley and decided to go here for dinner (since my DH wasn't with us) as she had never been. We had a really great dinner! We shared the Field Greens Salad and the BBQ chicken pizza on their whole wheat bread. Everything was really tasty and just enough for us to share. We also shared the brownie sundae for dessert!

Between the sticker shock and impending carb coma I ordered coffee. There was nothing on the menu remotely appealing or even interesting - let alone worth the money.

Jane A.,"Temecula, United States",0,1,,1.0,14/8/2011,"Sadly disappointed by a once-cherished family restaurant.  Never will my husband and I bring our children to this specific California Pizza Kitchen because of the horrible management.  All of the employees were absolutely impeccable, but the moment an issue comes up with our food the old, racist, snobby manager Gil Gallager does not resolve our issue without a petty argument.  We ordered a Habanero pizza, in which we were informed by our server that if we didn't like it we could get another pizza.  My husband and I each tried a pizza and decided that we both didn't like it, in which Gil acted as if we had already eaten the entire pizza and were just trying to get a free pizza.  We especially did not like the way he talked to employees when cutting pizzas, either.  USING SLANG AND CUSS WORDS  IN SPANISH DOES NOT MEAN THAT NOBODY ELSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.  It took a total of 29 minutes for our replacement pizza to come out (the Tostada w/chicken, in which I would DEFINITELY recommend this dish).  My husband and I were left eating our pizza quickly in order to finish our dish by the same time the kids ate their dessert.  As delicious as the Tostada pizza was, it definitely was not worth the 29 minute wait or the complaints from the kids.  We understand that ordering another pizza mid-meal may take a little longer for us to recieve the food, the amount of time we waited was absolutely absurd and the only apology we ever received was from our server who obviously felt bad for their incompetent manager.  Never will I come here again because of Gil.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=380

David J.,"San Diego, United States",7,72,,3.0,19/8/2006,"CPK has been around for a while. It still works for me. If you're shopping or trolling around Fashion Valley or hitting a movie, this place is an alternative to the standard food court offerings nearby.  Today I deviated from the staple BBQ chicken salad and went for the new Thai Crunch Salad. They seem to change their menu and add new pizzas and other items periodically. A while back I tried the more authentic italian style pizza with the crunchy flatbread. Some pizza purists would ask what the heck is such and such doing on a pizza, but I dig the various creations.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=380
