Meg W.,"Savannah, GA",344,180,323,4.0,9/19/2017,"I am actually a fan of Chili's!  Ok, hear me out- I'm not usually a huge fan of chain restaurants, but you can get a good meal here for such a good deal!  My boyfriend and I come here occasionally and get the 2 for $22 meal.  Seriously, you can't beat that price for a large meal out!  It may not be the fanciest of places, but we embrace the atmosphere and typically enjoy our meals. The 2 for $22 special is seriously the bomb.  You get one appetizer to share and TWO entrees for $22.  Amazing.  We love their endless chips and salsa.  I don't know- something about those thinly fried chips is really good.  This past weekend, we both ordered the 6oz steak for our entrees, which comes with 2 sides.  I got the loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli, as that's what it is usually paired with (although you can substitute any side for no additional cost).  So.  Much.  Food. !!!  The steak was cooked just as I preferred, and the loaded mashed potatoes were so indulgently good.  The broccoli was the only letdown- it lacked any kind of flavor, but the rest of the meal made up for it.  Overall, it was a really yummy meal! We've also done the 2 for $35, which comes with 2 margaritas and a dessert to share.  I don't come here often, but I've never had a bad experience here.  Although it is a chain restaurant, the deals offered make it worth it every now and then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah

Kirk S.,"Atlanta, GA",93,2,,2.0,11/4/2017,"The service was very slow - the server disappeared for long stretches of time and seemed unable to manage more than one task at a time. The fried cheese balls were over-cooked and over-salted. The chips for the nachos were stale. The ""side"" of guacamole was an extra $1, but was laughably small.

If you can't  ""manage"" to keep your bathroom clean then I have no faith you can fix my dinner. But I ordered anyway. The waitress was very nice. So my food came to the table after a very long wait. It was not good, too spicey. The waitress offered to send it back and have the sauce on the side. After another long wait, the manager brings it out and it's cold. Unacceptable!

The place was clean and the greeter was super sweet. I would recommend this Chili's. The food came out correct and quickly. The chipotle chicken flatbread was to die for and the Caribbean salad was so refreshing! The pineapple could have been a little more fresh though.

Erik P.,"Savannah, GA",49,7,,4.0,4/11/2017,"I made a quick stop by this Chili's with a group for a bite to eat and must admit I was impressed.  We were promptly greeted and seated, which I have found not to be the case with other Chili's locations I have visited.  The waiter was attentive and attempted to anticipate our needs by offering extra napkins, plates with the appetizers, and to go cups of drinks.  I really did not want to go based off past experiences with this brand, but I was really impressed with this location and will visit this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah
Josh E.,"Antioch, IL",57,1,,1.0,10/27/2016,"Literally the worst service and staff I've ever seen in my life. Definitely a top down effect, from the managers on staff down to the waitresses. No sense of time or coordination. The food is what you'd expect from any location, but good luck getting out of there under 1.5 hour. I travel for work and eat out almost every night, and I've had bad service, but this takes the cake. Dine in or still at the bar at your own risk",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah

It won't ever be a memorable meal but the cleanliness of the restaurant left me feeling like I was in an episode of the twilight zone... or candid camera. Service was prompt but it made me even more confused. They were so prompt that I was left wondering why they did so little to clean the place. there was food smeared onto the walls, dead flies in the windowsills, trash and dirt all over the floor or in a weird sticky substance across the tables, and that was just in the dining room! About halfway through my mail I got up to go to the bathroom, i've been in rural truck stops that smelled better, the restroom smells like a latrine at a Boy Scout camp, there was trash in urine all over the floor none of the toilets have been flushed and I honestly think I'd have better luck getting clean washing under our backyard hose that in those sinks. I was astonished at the level of dirt in the place. The menu holders were literally caked in rust, the salt and pepper was moist and unusable, after looking around a while I decided it was time to go, we didn't finish our food, paid and got the heck out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah

Roger A.,"Brooklet, GA",2,174,1,4.0,12/19/2015,"First of all, I must say our table was clean and our waiter was quick to take our order, quick to refill our drinks, and overall exceeding good in his service given. Second, it is all you enchiladas, so instead if $9.49 for 3 it ended up being $9.99 for 11...so it was lots of good food for little money.. The beef enchiladas and their filling are excellent, and the included chili cilantro rice was very enjoyable. Every additional refill order included just two more sizzling hot enchiladas which was fine by me...I had him order more every time the next refill plate arrived...and they were timed perfectly!!? My lady had the Buffalo chicken salad with the wing sauce on the side instead if on the salad so she was able to DiP the chicken pieces into the wing sauce instead if having it on everything. We were both very pleased with everything...

I grabbed dinner here with a med student friend who is on a strict student budget, so I came here and tried hard to not cry during my meal. I didn't cry, so that's a win I suppose. I surmise the beer helped the otherwise lackluster experience. I approve of the happy hour drink specials, prices, and if you really need to munch on something, the fried pickles were the best thing on the menu.

Ava A.,"Savannah, GA",318,230,677,1.0,1/11/2013,"I have had better service and cleaner food in third world countries. In a nut shell, my trip had dirty dishes, dirty booths, bad shrimp and pathetic service. I always come back here due the 2 for one beer special all day everyday but over the last year this place has changed. I had a love affair with the Chicken Chili Lime Soup, it was low-fat and full of flavor.   I would crave it and drive down to enjoy the tasty stuff.  It is off the menu now.   So we came in on a Saturday night after a meeting.  We ordered some shrimp tacos and the shrimp was bad.  Real bad.  Had to spit it out bad.  The waiter never came back on the Saturday night I was there to check so I just left money on the stupid table.  Stunned by the awful food and service as I go to this establishment frequently and it is usually pretty good. A week later I return for a Saturday lunch. The place wasn't that busy.  We were shown to our booth.  It was dirty.  Food stuck to it dirty.  The seat also needed to be wiped off, when I turned around to alert the wait staff she had already disappeared.  I waited standing up and still had to flag someone down to get the goo off the seat.  Once I explained why I was standing I was passed a wet cloth so I could wipe it off myself.  WOW!  No apology for the dirty booth seat or table.    I ordered soup, and a water to start off our meal.   Water glass had a floater in it.  Soup was running everywhere and the spoon was caked with food.   Bowl had a chip broken out of it.  I also ordered a salad, which consisted of bagged white iceberg lettuce, and white crusty carrots.  Wait staff never checked back after we got our food.  My date wanted mustard and ketchup but never got a chance to ask for them by any server.  We flagged another server down and she looked at us and walked away.   Our waitress just slammed the check down on the tabletop while talking to her friend, some 20 minutes later.  No water refills offered, to go boxes were not offered, questions were not asked as to why we had not eaten our food.  There was complete apathy for the patrons experience at this establishment.   I don't know if I can trust this Chili's for dining in the future. Although, 2 for 1 on beers is a hard deal to beat.  Please fix the service.  Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=20

One of the ladies I was with said politely excuse me Miss excuse me Keri.  She cuts her eyes at the table begins to roll her eyes and said I'm with a table I will be right there in a ugly manner.  Now mind you the receipts were in her hand.  The correct thing to do was give us the receipts and than take the order. Comeback after the order was taken to get payment.  But, nope this chick wants to be ugly and disrespectful.  Walks away from the table talking junk and says we were rude.  Now that wasn't my battle to fight because that was directed towards me..... Now this is when the problem came in with.  She goes and charges our credit cards for the meal.  Because she's mad at the co-workers she slams my credit card down by the door with pens to sign. Mind you anybody could have gotten my credit card and ran out the door.  So I said you aren't going to give me my card the way I gave it to you.  Yet again she's running off at the mouth and being unprofessional.  So yes I got on her level and said well there goes your tip you stupid bitch.  I apologized to the manager.  It takes alot to get me mad. But Keri still comes back to argue and plead her case.  Like I told the manager I'm too grown to argue and I'm not arguing with her period.  I left and walked out.  The other co-workers kept talking to the manager.  He was great he gave me the Corporate Office number and I have called to file a complaint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=20

As soon as we sat down we were promptly approached by the waitress and advised on what was the best that day. I ordered potato soup with guacamole burger and my wife got quesadilla salad. The food was good though I would prefer to have it little warmer. Also my burger felt somewhat unbalanced, each different bite felt differently than the previous one. Not for much but you could feel that. We also ordered cheesecake and chocolate molten cake they were really delicious and well made. The place was clean and modern-looking and although it was pretty full it was loud at all. The waitress was very nice and made us felt welcome there. Overall I think this place doesn't disappoint.

Now I work in the service industry so I understand not being in a great mood at work but you need to try and fake it at least. Anyway, the only reason I was really upset that she took so long to find out if we wanted to order did was because I knew that my grieved had worked through lunch in the heat so I was really more worried about him. I've been to this location before and whether it's the dining room or the bar I've had similar service issues.

Keith B.,"Savannah, GA",2,4,,2.0,7/2/2012,"Busy for a Sunday night for some reason... still... unacceptably slow service, TERRIBLE tasting water, and long wait for our food (appetizer, soup, and salad)  only redeeming factor is 2 for 1 beer (10oz tho), wine, well drinks and small margaritas",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40
Jonancy F.,"Savannah, GA",1,6,1,5.0,3/24/2011,"Two other couples as well as my husband and I meet twice a month at Chili's to unwind. The service is great, the price is good, and the wait isn't too bad either......Having Happy Hour all day is also a plus! Thank you Chilis!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40
Jess M.,"Philadelphia, PA",118,193,19,3.0,1/18/2010,"Headed here late night to meet up with some people and had a great time. Our New Yorker waitress was friendly and hilarious. The margaritas were 2 for 1 and our food came out practically before we ordered it. The waitress graciously split up the bill amongst the 7 of us, making no complaint about how annoying it can be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40

Erin G.,"Pooler, GA",10,53,,1.0,2/13/2009,"You know, I like Chili's a lot as far as these types of restaurants go.  But *this* Chili's ... we've gone here a few times on lunch hour, and it is very hit or miss.  And when they miss, they really miss.  The service goes from passable to downright disgusting, and the food goes from decent to ""do I really want to put this into my body??""  The last visit resulted in a co-worker's illness, and unless I hear they've replaced the whole staff or something equally drastic, I don't imagine we'll be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40
Berry J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",4,11,1,3.0,4/8/2010,"Was dissapointed in the white chocolate molten cake, the cake wasn't heated enough so the inside wasn't gooey and molten!  Also, coke zero was on the menu but they do not offer it.  Service was fast and friendly though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40

Jon S.,"Savannah, GA",0,7,4,3.0,11/24/2010,"I've always liked the idea of eating at Chili's, but when I eat here I always feel there was something missing.  The food is properly prepared and matches the description, but just doesn't impress me (yet I keep coming back, hoping for something different - definition of insanity?).   Anyway, the family went to Chili's this past weekend for dinner.  The server was good, offering suggestions and saying, ""That's what I order"" and ""That's really good"" which is encouraging.  I ordered the ribs with honey-chipotle sauce, the wife got the bacon ranch chicken quesadilla, and the kids got Burger (with cinnamon apples), Corn Dog (with fries) and Quesadilla (with corn).  Oh-yeah, we got the Crispy Onion and Jalapeno stack for an appetizer.  In summary, it was so-so.  The ribs were fine, but it would have been nice to have a little sauce on the side.  Plus, when I read ""chipotle"" I usually think of spicy.  Not in this sauce.  It could use a little kick.  The wife's quesadilla was very bland.  I should have added more salsa or asked what alternative sauces they had, but the waiter seemed to disappear for 10 - 15 minutes at a time.  On the plus side, the kids gobbled their food right up.  My daughter loved the cinnamon apples and my son (who eats basically nothing) devoured the wife's quesadilla (don't tell him what was in it).  Overall, a nice dinner, but nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40
Violet B.,"Beaufort, SC",3,33,5,1.0,8/2/2009,"I normally enjoy Chili's, but this one is horrible. I received some of the worst customer service I have ever gotten at a restaurant. After sitting at the table for 45 minutes the server informs us that he forgot to put in our order. After another 45 minutes we finally receive our food which has obviously been forgotten again under the heat lamp. The server did not want to inform his manager of the situation and offered to buy us a dessert himself. I was not interested in dessert and I did not complain to management because I figured I would not be satisfied and left knowing I will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=40
