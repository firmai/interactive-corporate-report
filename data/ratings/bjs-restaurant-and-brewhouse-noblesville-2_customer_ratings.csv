74,Jonathan A.,"Westfield, IN",121,40,23.0,5.0,2017-02-11,I gotta say this is probably one of my new favorite places to go. The food was fresh hot and came out fairly quickly.

53,Alexandria T.,"Fortville, IN",0,3,,3.0,2017-02-18,"I was so excited to go to bjs since I haven't been to one in 6 months when I was in Texas. My first experience (on Tuesday) was amazing. Our server was awesome. I wish I knew her name. She was fast, knew what she was doing, and very helpful. But our second visit ( tonight) was another story. First off I added my name to the wait list, went in to check in, they told me it would be 40 minutes at the latest. Okay sounds great. So we hung out for 50 minutes, then asked how much longer, they said about 10 minutes there was one other 2 top in front of us. Okay thank you. Well as we were standing there waiting I noticed that there was a table that was dirty. So I just kinda watched it for a little. A server came to take off the check book, then it sat there for 8 minutes. There were 4 managers standing around talking not 2 feet away. About 2 minutes later a manager come and puts all the glasses together but just left it there. I waited about 5 more minutes the went to say something. As I was saying something to the manager someone clean off the table. I was explaining to a manager what I have noticed and he just said there are two people waiting can you wait 5 minutes then we will take care of you. NO SORRY OR EXPLANATION. He just looked at me like I was stupid and just walked away. I wasn't even done talking to him. This continued to bother me through the night because I felt like I was not important. We finally got seated and the servers took very good care of us. My only concern was that when the servers are putting in our order they kinda Hover over and it's hard to talk without feeling rude. Besides that the rest of dinner was nice. I just felt very disrespected by that one manager with a pink button up.  Food was AWESOME!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=80,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

30,Lauren W.,"Fishers, IN",137,97,1093.0,4.0,2017-02-22,"BJ's is just what the Noblesville/Fishers area needed! The restaurant has a fun and lively atmosphere.  They serve a variety of craft beers, both their own BJ's brewed beer and a small selection of local microbrews. BJs is known for their handcrafted draft sodas that are made fresh daily. If neither of those beverages strike your fancy, they have a huge selection of cocktails and wine. They have about anything you could ever want on the menu...variety of appetizers, pasta, soup, pizza (both deep dish and flatbreads), ribs, chicken entrees, steak, sandwiches, salads and of course dessert...the Pizookie (I'll get to that later)!  We ordered chicken pot stickers, sriracha queso, a golden beat and arugula salad, and BJ's Brewhouse Classic tavern-cut pizza. All of the food was great! My favorite part of the meal was the Pizookie...a cookie in the form of a pizza what's not to love! It was Tuesday night, so the Pizookies were only $3 each. We ordered the chocolate chunk, which had two scoops of delicious vanilla ice cream on top of a warm chocolate chip cookie! They have 9 different flavors of Pizookies. I can't wait to go back and try another!  My only compliant is that the service was slow and the staff was not very attentive. The restaurant was packed when I went and they recently just opened, so perhaps that is why. BJ's has something for everyone and the food is delicious. Be sure to order a Pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

90,Markel W.,"Noblesville, IN",21,55,74.0,4.0,2017-02-28,"This is a new spot right outside the HTC facility and it was a pleasant surprise. While it was a long line to have a seat at the table, there was plenty of room at the bar. They brew an array of their own beers, so there's a huge variety. The facility itself is very attractive. We order dinner and appetizers. The appetizer portion was very sufficient and ended up filling me up prior to dinner. I ate my dinner the next day for lunch, salmon, and it was still delicious the next day. But for all of this, the bill was unexpectedly high. I'd give it $$$. The calamari was pretty good an the sriracha wings were on point.

36,Tony M.,"Indianapolis, IN",43,51,47.0,5.0,2017-03-05,"The great -  1) Mommy was blown away by the complimentary kids starter that included a little garlic knot and.a mini fresh fruit cup. This place gets that a happy child makes happy parents.  2) Rachel was phenomenal. She offered suggestions and was incredibly attentive to our every need.   3) Mommy was very pleased with the small beer tasters that allowed her to audition a couple of the many craft beers that are available on tap. The Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider was very nice if you want to stay away from hoppy, bold beers.  The good -  1) The Barbacoa Cauliflower tacos were very flavorful but the pita offered just a bit too much breading for my taste. Would have loved them on a simple corn tortilla. I was served with side of red quinoa and brown rice super salad. My wife liked it very much.  2) The Turkey Burger was very good but the spicy mustard was a bit too bold for my wife. Without it it would have warranted an excellent rating.  The Could Have Been Better - 1) The Calamari was tough and chewy and was not a favorite.  Overall the experience exceeded our expectations for a new restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676

11,Rachel C.,"Fishers, IN",119,172,306.0,5.0,2017-03-10,Stellar service and food!! Our server was great about walking us through the history and background info of the restaurant as it is a new chain here in Indiana. He even let us know that if we downloaded the BJ's app on our phone we could receive a free mini pizookie (pizza cookie) ((it's so worth!)). I love that they have a health conscious section in their menu and how expansive their menu is in general. My husband and I shared an order of the turkey burger and a seared ahi salad. Food came out quickly and man it was DELICIOUS. I think I'm going to start getting into turkey burgers because of this burger. It was so juicy and flavorful; and the added dried cranberries with a kick of Dijon mustard on the burger just sent it to another level. The ahi salad was great as well. I loved how they added nori (seaweed) all over the dish and it really made me feel like I was eating a sushi dish without the carbs! And of course to finish off our lunch we were rewarded with a mini white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie A LA FREAKING MODE. ON THE HOUSE. Definitely looking forward to coming back for dinner!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676

We were sat rather quickly,(Sunday Night mind you) and our Server John was on top of things from the get go. We did however wait abnormally long for our beverages to hit the table, (Diet Pepsi). We ordered the queso, salsa, and the Brussel Sprouts. The chips were really greasy and stayed that way, almost like the oil wasn't hot enough and just saturated them. The Brussel Sprouts were great except for the random burnt french fries that were mixed in. Our main courses by the way were great! The Alfredo is always good and the salad my wife had was fresh and crisp.  Like I said John was all over it and made the night great for some of the little mishaps from the kitchen.

After that it was an additional 20 min.  Mind you 5 big tables were empty when I walked to the bathroom during our wait...and don't think this is an unusual thing- this was happening to everyone around us in the waiting area.  To tell you your table is ready, the hostess screams your name. This restaurant is LOUD.   Wait staff is slow- very slow.  Took 20 min for 2 guys to figure out which one had our table.  Took 20 min after that to get drinks (I ordered water).  Took 30 min for them to bring my son's lemonade. The bathroom ran out of toilet paper.  The waiters do NOT take away empty glasses or dirty plates- they just keep piling them on the table.  The first time we ate at this restaurant our waiter was also ridiculously slow- and I even told a waitress walking by our table that someone spilled water on the floor and she stopped and looked at me and then kept walking.   I retold another waiter that water had spilled and he grabbed a towel that looked like they would wipe tables off with it and he wiped it up.   The food was so good I wanted to bring back the whole family including my elderly mother to give it another chance.  Both times I thought that the new flooring was slippery and you need to be careful walking so you don't slip.   Really Good food.  Desserts are fun and yummy.   Took forever to get a bill.  Lots of TV's.  Stressful dinner because of the wait time and staff and if being such a loud place.  3.5 hours later we were done with dinner- which isn't what we had planned.   I would warn anyone from attempting this place on a weekend night.   I've tried this place twice now- they've got a LOT of issues to work through.  **I think corporate needs to come and retrain this staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.308,3.1200000000000006

My deep dish reminded me of Pizza Hut's, but no where near as greasy as PH's.  Flavor was fine, but somewhat pricey for the quality. Pasta had good flavor. Salad at our table looked fine, but the ahi looks a ton smaller that the menu photo. Desserts were good, and our kids liked them a lot. The beers were decent as well.  Had multiple IPAs (which we enjoyed) and a bourbon barrel aged stout, which was just okay for the style.  It got better as it warmed, because it's served at a temperature colder than recommended for stouts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.636,3.0800000000000005

My service the first visit was excellent on every level. I recommend this place highly to all of our hotel guest looking for a place to eat,drink,and meet with business people for conversation. That being said,in hesitatant at this point to do so. I brought a friend to lunch after church,was greeted promptly and curtious. Was seated quickly,and was quite pleased. We was greeted by our server asked for drink order then is when things turned. We wanted an appetizer as we were deciding what to order and just have a very casual relaxing lunch and conversation. As she took our app order she said so what do you want to order for lunch? I volunteered we'd like to just enjoy our appetizer for a bit. Not to her liking she asked again as soon as she saw the runner deliver the app.again I declined to order. Third time we did go ahead and order. Our server wasn't very informed to preparation of the mushroom burger.and didn't care to find an answer to my friends question only wanted our order. I ordered the mahi mahi and   was good not great... We had barely started eating when our server approached our table with my fork headed to my mouth her question wasn't how's your food tasting,is everything okay can I get you anything,none of the normal,just do y'all need a box??? Dumbfounded I gestured to my unbeaten meal,and stated no mam were eating but thank you. Well I can take this if you want to the app.,no thank you,we are still working on that also. No refills was offered for our drinks. I asked for a dessert menu later as none was offered. My friend had a after dinner drink the server don't understand the order so she was charged a full kaluha a full bailys for a cup of coffee which was a 15.50 cup of coffee.

He was very nice, a little stressed because he had several tables sat around the same time. However, he was quick with the drinks and placing our order.  My husband's salad and my son's kids appetizer plate were delivered very quickly after our order was placed, so all was good.   However, timed started to tick by.  Ten ... fifteen ... twenty ... thirty ... forty-five ... almost an HOUR later, part of my son's dinner was brought out.  Approximately 10 minutes after that, part of my dinner was brought out. I notified the server of the missing items and my husband's meal and he assured us that everything would be out quickly, and he would return with the missing sides.  The server brings the sides and another 10 minutes go by and my husband finally gets his meal.  His ribeye steak was the worst steak he or I have ever had.  He ordered it medium; however, it was more than well done.  The steak was seasoned so poorly that he couldn't even eat it.   It was clear throughout the meal that something was wrong in the kitchen as we noticed that no one in our section had food and no food was being brought out of the kitchen.  Eventually, the managers started walking around with the tickets for each table; however, neither one ever made it to all of the tables.  It seemed that only certain tables were selected.  We asked our waiter and other waiters to send the manager to our table; however after 15 minutes of waiting, the manager never spoke with us.  We heard rumors from other tables about the debacles in the kitchen (technology issues, staff walking out, managers trying to cook the food, etc); however, I find it quite inconsiderate that the managers didn't have the decency to speak with each individual table.  What makes me even more frustrated with this situation is we still received a bill.  Really!?!  After an hour of waiting and poor food, we still received a bill and the managers expected the servers to handle the frustrated customers.  It seems to me that the managers don't always have the procedures / logistics down to run a restaurant effectively, and that is sad.  I am disappointed in this experience and the food.  BJ's is no longer a restaurant that we will return to as they don't seem to respect all of their customers and don't place value in the customer service & logistics needed to run an effective restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.5640000000000005,3.3200000000000003

Great mix w mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, artichoke dip, and wings. We all ordered different menu items for our dinners. Everyone was very happy with their selections. The burgers are huge and juicy, steak was made perfectly to order and the mashed potatoes are delicious. The thin crust pizza is light and lets you enjoy the flavors of the generous toppings.

24,Kerisa S.,"Fishers, IN",111,64,59.0,5.0,2017-08-17,"It's been a long while since my last review. Why? Summer chaos! So many wedding activities, travel, family functions, work stress, dog responsibilities, the list goes on and on and on! I just really haven't had the time. However, since I visited BJ's 3 times in 1 week I think I will take a quick minute and write about them!  I know BJ's has been open in noblesville for a while now and the parking lot is always packed. I never felt a need to go as I have gone to the one in Greenwood and one in Oklahoma City. Those restaurants were good, okay, nothing to write home about so didn't really care when BJ's opened here. However, my husband and I have gotten into this kick of attending the same 1-3 restaurants over and over and over again this summer with our busy lifestyles (another reason I was on review hiatus). I wanted to stay close to home one Friday but nothing elaborate  instead of the normal 3 we had been frequenting. I suggested BJ's.  Parking lot was packed when we arrived and the wait was 40 min but we don't like tables anyway and lucked out finding two seats at the bar. Our bar tender Carolyn was super friendly and helpful. I literally asked to see every Belgian beer bottle before I made my selection- and she was fine with it! She rocks. By the way, the one I picked (Delirium) was AMAZING and I recommend!  I was excited to see a menu with so many options. Seemed bigger than what I remembered from the other locations. AND they have gluten free pizza!  of course I asked Carolyn a million questions again and picked it because she said it would be a crispy crust and I hate doughy pizza. My husband ordered the Hawaiian deep dish pizza. I just got sausage pepperoni and mushroom on mine.  When they came out my pizza sadly was not crispy but doughy/maybe undercooked in the dough. I asked her what happened!? She was mortified and immediately took care of it for me. A guy from the kitchen - maybe a manager- came out and said he was sorry she even told them extra crispy and they were going to fix it right away. They did, and it was AMAZING! Best gluten free pizza I have yet honestly.  Overall great night and great experience.  Sunday -2 days later- rolls around and we go to lunch with my husbands friend to the place we always go to, one of the 3 and sitting there I was blah. I don't like their alcohol beer wine selection and food is eh. I quickly asked if they could finish their drinks and we go to BJ's to eat instead. We did! Sat at the bar again. Had Carolyn again. Everyone super fun and friendly again. Great experience.  Tried the tuna sashimi salad and it was okay, it just wasn't my pizza. Also got the couscous Mac and cheese which is a small plate but very cheesy. Husband and I loved but you need to be a big cheese lover. Drank my beer again!  Wednesday then rolls around and my husband went back to eat there since we didn't want to cook before leaving on Thursday for a short vacation. Carolyn was our bartender again, this time we were on first name basis and she knows my drink. I already felt like a regular and quite at home. Decided to try a burger but I already forgot which one, but it WAS good. Still tho- gluten free is still my fave. I've honestly been craving it all day today I think I'll make a trip there this weekend after being out of town the past  two weekends. Also need my delirium fix!  Definitely worth a try. Menu is huge. If you don't fall in love right away, try again, there are so many options! They also have a rewards program I discovered on the Wednesday visit and signed up for. Who doesn't like rewards!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

I also got BJ's pumpkin ale, which was better and tasted as expected. We also ordered food. We all got a broccoli cheddar soup and mom got an order of ribs.
