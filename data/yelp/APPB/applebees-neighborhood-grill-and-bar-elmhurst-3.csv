Jennifer R.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",8,13,,2.0,8/20/2016,"This Applebee's needs to be cleaner and needs to hire nicer staff/waiters without nasty attitudes. The food is mediocre, and other Applebee's are better.

Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,327,1234,2.0,1/17/2013,"The waiter was pleasantly professional and nice. Rare when it comes to these chain restaurants.  We ordered off the 2fer deal. 2 ""full size"" entrees and 1 shared appetizer. (As per their menu) Um my entree was more like a kids meal portion. Heck even my niece got more fries than I did potatoes. I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp with roasted potatoes, the chicken and shrimp had good flavor but the potatoes were bland and very greasy. And again - a VERY small portion. Anyway, glad I tried it.. now I know. I go to this mall all the time, so I won't be back unless it's for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=20
Raphael R.,"New York, NY",60,27,19,1.0,1/20/2016,"I've been a regular of this place and I loved going here until my last recent visit during a hangout with my friends. First of all, we been sitting there for 30 minutes with no acknowledgement at all. Then when we ordered, the food took awhile as well. Looking around for our server to get our drinks refilled took so long because she's nowhere to be found and by the time it came, it came with the dessert. I don't really complain how long the food takes when hanging out with friends  but the moment that I had to pay on their tablet and this woman went ahead to decide how much I'll put as her tip (in that case 20%) which she does not deserve and left right away while I'm stuck on signing the tablet with my signature. I wouldn't mind tipping her that much if she deserved it, but no. Then she had the nerve to put that much tip herself?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=20

The waiter was so nice and she was constantly checking up on us to see if things are okay. I forgot her name but she was super nice and pleasant. The price was really good. We go the three appetizers for 18 bucks and got the 2 entree for $27 with one size appetizer. We though it the three appetizer was a sampler, so a little bit of everything.

Teresa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,107,7,1.0,6/17/2016,Waited who knows how long for someone to come acknowledge us. Could see it was pretty packed. Eventually someone came by. I could tell it be a long day. My daughters were annoyed. Practically falling asleep. After working since the morning this shouldn't have taken so long. Ordered from the 2 for 27 menu. I ordered a quesadilla. About 20 mins later the appetizer cane with my food. Then the girls food came. Really sad. We ate just wanted to go. The waitress asked how we were I was more in an annoyed state of mind. What do you expect. This was the longest meal ever.

Aura B.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",211,503,3693,3.0,3/27/2014,"The menu looks promising,  like multiple visits are needed to try all the meal choices. I had the Taco soup and it was very good and tasty. Then, I was very satisfied with the Chicken Quesadilla Grande. It was REALLY good and tasty, more like excellent. You know when you are trying to find a new meal with a new flavor, this was IT. It was so good that I ordered 2 of the same thing. I Absolutely  have to come back and try everything in the menu. I tried the dish with the Steak and shrimps, it was good. I did not liked that the size of the steak was too small and the shrimps were extremely salty. I down graded to 3 stars. My 4th visit, I took a special friend here on her lunch hour. They were very late in serving the food, they were not that busy. The waiter had to be called a few times because he was chatting with his co-workers and not paying attention to the tables.

The restaurant had at least 8 free tables but there was still a 20 minute wait. Waitress was rude, forgot we ordered ice tea and never brought it. Forgot we ordered appraisers so it got to our table after we got our main course.   Ordered the 2 for $20 deal, I had the chicken tender,  the chicken tenders were the size of my finger length and width wise.

April F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",277,149,291,1.0,9/19/2014,"Horrible service. Hostess was unfriendly and had a puss face. Then the waitress screwed up our drink orders. Then she screwed up my boyfriends dinner order and neglected to adjust the bill accordingly.  After wasting 2 hours of my life in that ghetto hell hole our bill was in excess of $80. And for what? 2 gross cocktails that tasted like water, a salad and a sandwich, That is absolutely freaking ridiculous and obscene. We could have gone to a real restaurant and spent the same and went home with at least a buzz and satisfied tummies. NEVER AGAIN!!!!

I used the restroom before my meal came, and it took away my appetite. DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!  I assumed it hadn't been cleaned overnight because I couldn't for the life of me believe that it could get so gross before 1pm!!!  Don't eat here unless you are really desperate.

All other servers seem lazy and unprofessional; rather be socializing amongst each other than waiting on guests as they should be. The food is typical Applebee's food, no complaints there.

K. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,1.0,8/21/2014,"Fire the staff in the back, if haven't already!!!!!! This is a late review but I still can't get it off my mind. I went there in June with my family for a little celebration. Normally, I would go for a bacon cheeseburger but that night I decided to change it up a little and ordered a ""well done"" steak. Upon arrival it looked good but once cut opened it was red and bleeding in the middle. -_-  I DIDN'T eat it.  Now,  I am not one to really complain or send back food & have my night ruined over an uncooked steak. So, I just pushed the steak to the side and ate the potatoes. Still, wishing that I would've stuck with getting my ""norm"",  I decided to ask my waitress (Who's the only reason why this place would even be given stars) for a bacon cheeseburger to go. Before walking out my TO-GO bag was given to me  and silly me didn't even bother in checking it until the next morning.  In my defense, I always order a bacon cheeseburger at other locations and it never changes.....BOY was I WRONG! When I opened my bag the next day to reheat the burger I was shocked to find UNCOOKED French Fries and GROUND BEEF (literally) slapped in between the bun. Never have I ever experienced this at any other AppleBee's location. I am always given a patty & cooked fries! Not straight up ground beef that looked like they just pulled out of  its package and grilled for two minutes on both sides!   -What was in that bag was disgusting and a violation. Frozen fries? Uncooked Ground Beef? Who's working in the kitchen? The Health Department needs to close this location down!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=20
Shane G.,"South Ozone Park, NY",13,4,1,2.0,5/9/2014,"I have never had a great experience in Applebee's. The food portions are so small and the service is consistently mediocre. For dinner the place definitely cannot compete with any respectable restaurant. The upside of Applebee's though is the pricing. Most of the dishes are very cheap. They have combo deals and many other deals tucked away in the menu. If you work near an Applebee's it is a great place to go for break or after work for drinks. You'll end up saving more money doing that as opposed to going to any other restaurant. I'd describe Applebee's as a low quality, but low price restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=20

Chris L.,"REGO PARK, NY",7,65,142,4.0,2/16/2017,"I went here for lunch based on the $9.99 All in lunch special.  For $9.99, you get a choice of one of their signature burgers, a side and a drink.  What can I say?  I'm a sucker for nationally advertised food campaigns.  You probably save $5 with the lunch special versus normal prices.  I ordered they the tablet on the table.  I preferred this method over a waitress because you can more readily see what you can add or take away on your sandwich or choose as a side.   I got the brunch burger which had a fried egg, hash browns and bacon with a side of fries.  The burger was good.  It was actually done medium as I requested.  The fries were over salted but otherwise okay.  When I was done with my meal I used the tablet to pay.  It was very convenient and got me out of there quicker than waiting for my check.  I was able to be in and out within 30 minutes without feeling rushed.

Zahra S.,"Kew Gardens, NY",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2017,"My fiancé and I came here last night 12/15 at around 8:30-9pm after a long afternoon/evening of shopping. We were HUNGRY. We usually love Applebee's and their service but this time it was a miss due to a bad apple. We stepped inside and waited by the entrance behind 2 girls who were also waiting to be seated, about 5 minutes go by and the girls are escorted by a short hostess to their seats. We continue waiting another couple of minutes and a family enters and stands  behind us on line, the hostess returns and called over the family who just entered over to their table completely bypassing us as we were standing in FRONT of that family there is no way she could've missed us. And if she was unsure about who was next why not ask? We stood there dumbfounded waiting a few more minutes for her return and then my fiancé says to her - you know you skipped us. And, her response was ""well i don't know sir they said they were next"", which was a complete lie, we saw her call them over without asking any questions. She doesn't apologize but, we let it go while she's walking us over to a table, points to it and turns around and walks away and before we get to it or get a chance to sit she's gone. We look at the seats and it's dirty, open salt or sugar packets, straw wrappers and a tissue were on the seats. Fiancé refused to sit and he said we're leaving and I was disappointed and right behind him. Short hostess saw us walking out and didn't ask us any questions.  All of that waiting for nothing.

It didn't bother my cousin and I because she wanted to shop till she drops (literally) anyways. We came back and we got our seats right away. They kept their words!  Our waitress was so nice. She kept coming back every 3-5 minutes to check up on us. I don't remember her name but she made us felt welcomed and we had a great stay. I got bbq ribs and it was amazing! I would definitely recommend their ribs mmmm. I forgot what my cousin got but I remember it was fish. She didn't like it so she mainly ate the appetizers.  I really love the interior design of this apple bee's. Their wallpaper was the history of Newtown High School. Even though Newtown High School don't have a pleasant reputation, they made the school LOOKED like a great school back in the days.  I'm hoping I'll have time to come back here.

If you have a child, be careful because it's very easy for them to get to the games which tacks on $2 to your bill. But what's great about it is that you can pay directly on it.

I've eaten at this one a few times since it happens to be in the Queens Center Mall and let me tell you the service here is horrible.  Every time I come here I get the feeling that I'm in some kind of popularity contest and if they like you, you might get good service. I know that might sound like a little bit of a stretch of the imagination but every time I've come here there has been some customer lodging a complaint about their service. Is that a coincidence? I think not! While were there this time we witnessed the table next to us being seated right around the time we received our appetizers and they still didn't receive anything but their plates when we had finished our entire meal and my son and I are slow eaters. That's pretty bad! I'm talking about a good half an hour of waiting just to place their order. That's ridiculous! I felt bad for them. At one point I was tempted to say something but I didn't for fear of being punished by our own server who was already giving me looks of destain for having asked for a glass of water. Seriously, the people in this place need to take a class in social etiquette.

Applebee's is one of the best chain restaurants, way better than places like Chilis or Red Lobster. Applebees is a tight chain so even though I'm reviewing this location they're all the same and the workers here are the practically the same as anywhere else. Even though this location is located in the Queens Center Mall it's got its own entrance on the side of the mall and stays open even after the mall is closed.  Applebee's has some decent food like their french onion soup, boneless honey bbq wings, and most of the other items are done pretty well (amazingly well for a chain). Don't forget their 23oz Brewtus beers either. Applebee's is a good choice if you don't want to try and find a new place to go and want better food than a dive without spending too much.

I was a party of 3 and we ordered the Cajun steak and shrimp, spinach dip app, and the sizzling chicken. The App took forever to arrive and there were only a couple of chips. The entrees were cold our steak was raw and chewy and the potatoes were raw. Plus they charge you twice for flavored lemonade, once for the drink the other for the flavoring. All in all our bill came out to $80! $80 dollars and the food was soo poor.

Inside S.,"Elmhurst, NY",25,103,,3.0,3/1/2009,"I'm been coming to this Applebees since it opened back in 2004. Personally, I never had any problems with this place before.  This applebee's has a full bar and it's a pretty decent social area. There are nice decorations all around and it's overallness is pretty decent. Nice sporty atmosphere.  Their food is above average for frozen food and their burgers are quite decent; it sure beats the crap MCD across the street from the mall and within the mall. To really test this restaurant's style, dont order something with cheese, cheddar, or any sauce. Sauce and Cheese tend to overwhelm the food's actual flavor. I tried the grilled chicken steak and i was satisfied. The chicken was moist and tender while it was chewy and delicate. They offered me garnish and sauce but i denied it because it would be a waste of my money putting it on flavor enhancers.   I would recommend this applebees to anyone.

Tony C.,"Jackson Heights, NY",436,363,68,3.0,3/22/2008,"I had to go to Applebee's to try their 10oz Brewtus Steak Burger. A great name, and too enticing a description (10 ounces of chopped sirloin topped with cheese and bacon) to let this burger pass me by. The actual experience, however, was less than spectacular. In fact, I barely want to write (home) about it. Perhaps they really do use chopped sirloin, however it must be really lean sirloin, as the full 10oz patty has no juice to it what so ever. Part of the dryness could be due to the fact that they don't (as per company policy) cook medium-rare / rare burgers, so I ordered mine to medium doneness. What's the use of having a 10oz burger if it's dry? Applebee's Fries: The crunchiest fries evar! They keep their crunch even an hour after they're fried, amazing. Leaves me scratching my head, wondering what they do to achieve that extra crunch factor; maybe they use the double fry method? Anyhow, besides the crunch factor, there's also some flavor to these fries, and they are decent sized as well. I went in expecting some run-of-the-mill fries, and I left impressed by their offering. Revised from 2 stars to 3 stars on 5/7/08 on account of their kickass Honey BBQ wings. Read on... Honey BBQ Wings These wings are gooood. Get them. Savor them. It's not often I find myself chomping, sucking, and licking through my meal in such an uncouth demeanor. What can I say? It's the wings; they bring it out in me. The meat is that familiar juicy dark meat that we all love. The sauce is smoky sweet, and more importantly, just right. It's done so right that I find myself slathering more sauce (from the plate) onto the wings, gleefully licking my fingers dry. Dry! The wings are a good size as well. Not too small, not too big. ps: these wings are better than ""The Colonel's"" honey bbq wings. Citrus Terriyaki Wings Too salty for me. There's asian twang, tropical citrus flare, and, unfortunately, too much salt (i.e. soy sauce).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=60

The dip was pretty good, a good amount of spinach, creamy, hot, with melted parmesan on top. Lots of homemade, thin crispy tortilla chips, and salsa. The dip came out right away, about 5-10 minutes after we ordered.

Karen Y.,"College Point, Queens, NY",77,249,65,2.0,5/24/2009,"This AppleBees is situated right inside the Queens Center Mall and can be entered from the outside or from inside the mall. In the adjacent parking lot, they have signs for Applebees parking, but I'm not sure about pricing or whether or not it's validated. The first time I came here, service was okay for a weekday dinner. There was a while wait for dinner and servers are always running around because of the workload. It's not the typical Applebees restaurant that I'm used to with less attention from the servers and the rush from table to table, but they get the job done and I don't have a major problem with that--until now. Parking was plentiful at night near the mall so to avoid unjustified parking lot fees, my husband and I walked a block past the high school field to Applebees. There's this unwritten rule or a personal feeling I had when I went into this Applebees last week at the last hour at around 10PM (they close at 11pm.) I never try to go into restaurants near closing time because of the lack of service and who knows if the food is still fresh as everybody rushes to close. Unfortunately, I saw the Applebees commercial on TV featuring their realburgers and I couldn't stop the craving for one. As I went in with my husband, the hostess seated us right away and gave us the standard comment that our server will be right with us. Yeah, right. As I looked around, I saw a male server personally chatting up with some customers, taking his time, but his customers at least, had a drink on their table. Our female server, whom we presume is our server, since she was walking up and down our aisle, went to check how other customers are doing, but failed to pay us any attention. She could have at least said, ""I'll be right with you"" or ""would you like something to drink for now?"" but she ended up passing us, going to the table next to us and do some extra chatting. My husband said out loud that he was ready to order a few times. It seemed like ten minutes have past, but nobody paid us any attention. We were starving because we didn't eat much that day. My husband flagged down the hostess again and told her he was ready to order, but again, just like a robot, she told us that our server would be right with us. I know it's not her job, but at least she could flag down someone who can help us. I had questions about the menu too because they only applied a neon yellow realburger sticker on the menu with no prices or any information. I would have thought with all this TV promotion, Applebees could have promoted it better on a menu. On top of this, the chair next to me was a little ripped, contributing to my ripped seat phobia. This situation with nobody serving us made my husband angry and a minute later, we stood up, walked past our assumed server, walked past our hostess, and out the door. The hostess opened her mouth as if to say something, but didn't. I guess losing us as a customer isn't that big of a deal especially when it was almost time to close. I spent maybe less than twenty minutes there. I considered other Applebees locations, but it was already very late. I ended up going to Georgia Diner and having a good burger time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=80

Affu J.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,11,8,1.0,9/29/2011,the appelbees is one place where i love to go and just have good food especially in the mall! the best part is that u shop and then you eat! i have been to applebees plenty of times before... the one in the mall is not bad.. i went couple of times but recently i went with my friend and i must say this is the worst experience ever! the staff was very rude! especially the women who helps you get to a table was very rude! did not look at us for atleast 5 minutes cause she was busy talking to her co worker! it took half an hour for appetizer to arrive and an even longer time for the entree to arrive! the waiter was mean! he did not apologize for the delay and just did not pay attention! he was also busy talking to some chick.. maybe his girlfriend!  they even forgot to get some dip for my appetizer! will not go again unless they change their very unfriendly staff! i rather walk and go the the one on 63rd drive! where the service is much much better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elmhurst-3?start=80
