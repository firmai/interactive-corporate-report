Kenneth C.,"San Antonio, TX",217,26,50,5.0,10/8/2017,"Veggie Burger!!! OM NOM NOM!!!! All jokes aside, I really enjoyed my experience. The waitresses are super cool and knew the menu very well. Not to mention, they stay on top of their guest. They check consistently but no so much that you very like they're waiting on you to leave to drop them their tip. The bottomless fries came out hot every time which is a rarity based on previous experiences at other locations. Speaking of locations, it's in a plaza area between two reference cities: San Antonio and Cibolo, TX. However, it's far enough away from both that you'll need to prepare for at least a 20 minute drive to include traffic if you're going during rush hour or at the end of your day. They also have balloons for young kids which was great because my son wasn't in the most ""happy"" of moods when we visited. If you're coming to have an interview or a meeting, this is NOT the place. It gets loud when packed. If you're military, there are military discounts so make sure to pull out the ID card with your smiling face on it. Lastly, the parking lot is the biggest in the world so be Plan accordingly if you have elderly or injured people with you. Overall, I would go there again. In fact, I'll be there tomorrow. Take care, #YelpNation. -Cole",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma
Rachel K.,"San Antonio, TX",4,14,,1.0,10/20/2017,"I knew I shouldn't have come here, I've been to Red Robin one other time in 2006 and it wasn't that great. But I was willing to give it a try because on a Friday night I didn't want to drive very far with my two small children and Chillis is getting old. Next time we'll just go to Chillis.  I like to give places the benefit of the doubt, so we went in with a good attitude. The kids ordered chicken, I got an Avo-Cobb-O salad, which I assumed would come with some avocado (Spoiler alter, it had zero avocado in it), my husband ordered the bacon guac burger (which he assumed would have guac in it). Anyway, our server made that right but it took a while. That's fine, they were busy.  The real kicker was my tea. I ordered unsweet tea, which I have been informed was stupid because in the South everyone apparently wants diabetes so they put sugar in every damn thing so it's my own fault for expecting to get what I ordered, and I did get what I ordered. But then someone came by and unbeknownst to me filled my glass with syrup and I had to spit that disgusting concoction into the napkins they gave us.  We went, we ate (less than what we paid for), the service was okay, and we tipped our waitress but we will not be returning.  This crap that passes as food is way over priced.  And my daughter threw up everything she ate from there. Seriously never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma
Sandra V.,"San Antonio, TX",43,89,117,4.0,11/29/2017,"This location at the Forum is clean, friendly and fast in service. There are lots of burger choices and since we were on a low carb diet, we tried the burger with a lettuce wrap. It was a great, delicious choice and I opted for a salad instead of fries. Although, from previous trips- those fries are hard to pass up! I love how they have the seasoning salt on the table, so you can add as much as you want. They also have a wide variety of sauces- my favorite is the campfire sauce- a smoky, creamy bbq sauce. Red Robin has a fun ambiance with lots to look at and something on the menu for just about any appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma
LaToya S.,"San Antonio, TX",15,283,188,3.0,6/17/2017,"Despite getting my freckled lemonade poured on top of my head, arm, Apple Watch and leg, the experience was ok. I was taking a picture of our boys and our toddler wasn't looking at the camera so when the waitress, Amanda walked up, she took it upon herself to try and help out by holding the drink over my head to get him to look which ended in disaster. I was very upset with her but I kept my composure. On to the food... it was ok. The fries were warm like they'd been sitting under a lamp. The burger was ok, nothing to brag about. Our oldest son had the burger with the sunny side up egg on it and he enjoyed half of it as the other half was burnt. Our 8 year old had the kid's cheese pizza and he enjoyed it! Especially the bottomless apples. Our toddler got the mini meatballs and fruit cup. He ate a few of them and then started throwing them everywhere. 3 stars for the food. We may come back here but I'll ask for a different waitress if we get Amanda as our waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma

Bacon cheeseburger: son devoured it completely.   Alamo Burger: salsa, pepper jack cheese and guac was enjoyed by husband Red Robin Cheeseburger: my go to, supposed to come with special relish but server said not anymore (still enjoyable and cooked medium) Daughter hand a BLT crossiant that was huge.

Meg C.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",38,13,,1.0,10/30/2017,Well my family and I love Red Robin in California. So we stopped for a bite to eat here and it was not a good experience. The floor manager was nice but she could have removed the kids meal off the bill considering the pizza was cold. So my son refused to eat it. They tried to reheat it which never tastes the same. And usually when you order toppings on a pizza they should be cooked and not just tossed on top like a salad. What 2 yr old will eat raw mushrooms? I'll have to think long and hard before heading back there...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma

Jeffeory H.,"Miramar, FL",44,537,475,3.0,10/31/2016,This is my first visit to this location and I think it is a little better than the others I've been to. I like the burgers and endless fries. They have a good child's menu and my son loved the cod crunchies. Had the usual chill cheese burger with a grilled jalapeño. The only complaint I have is the noise level as with most it is super hard to carry on a conversation while eating. The service was exceptional even with 9 people in our group. Would be higher stars but they need to figure out how to dampen the noise level.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma
Will H.,"San Antonio, TX",1,78,,3.0,6/25/2017,"This is an average burger joint. Nothing special about the burger patties themselves.

I don't think I could enjoy my meal quite as much without it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the place always smells like dirty mop water when I walk in the doors. I don't know if it's just me but the smell permeates the air and makes me thankful for take out. Also, sometimes when I call in my to-go order it will take a while for someone to pick up the phone and then take the order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma

Sent it back and there is more food present - ordered my sons food came out wrong - she brought the appetizer after about 30 min then proceeded to drop the whole platter on table we were sitting at ( now we have to move) - forgot my sons drink for the 3rd time - had to get the rest of the food Togo because we didn't have time to eat  - I never tip on my card so I went to get cash from my car ten steps away.

P. Luly W.,"Las Vegas, NV",450,295,3951,4.0,11/11/2013,"I've been a fan of Red Robin burgers for years.  They are reliably good no matter where you go.  I am also a fan of their rewards program.  Doesn't cost anything to sign up.  You are given a card and your rewards are automatically loaded onto your card.   You receive an email whenever you have a reward - which can be freebies or discounts.  I usually go get my free birthday burger every year - The Royal Red Robin with the fried egg YUM! In San Antonio, I like this location.  It is usually not overly crowded.  However, when they are, the servers do an excellent job of keeping the peace and calm.   The kitchen staff must also have a good system in place because the food comes out quickly and everything is hot. There was quite a crowd today for the free Veterans Day meal.  The entire staff was friendly and attentive...thanking all the veterans.  The service was quick.  The food was up to standard.  Good job, Agora Red Robin staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=20

The burger came was tasty then my son was drinking orange juice and I noticed that there was something in it my husband took it out it was something like dirt or mold something that should not be in a cup i was upset cuz it was in my sons cup.

We were seated with not much wait time.  (Only half of our party was there). The gentleman took our drink order.  The first time I had the bottomless freckled lemonade.  It was very good!!! I lost count after 3.  I ordered the Avoo Cobb Bo salad (Cobb salad). It was great.  I had the chance to eat some garlic fries. Wow!!  I never knew they were bottomless.  My husband had a guacamole burger and enjoyed ever last bite of it.  My daughter had a tavern burger which she almost ate all of it.  We had some good laughs,  great food,  awesome service  and a birthday song.  I didn't give 5 starts because I didn't visit the restrooms.  I don't know the condition of the bathroom.  Sorry people.  I Don't forget they have a groupon available.

Susan N.,"Selma, TX",1,17,1,2.0,9/28/2015,"I went here today with my husband, and we wound up underwhelmed. When we were seated, we noticed that several tables all throughout the restaurant needed to be bussed. There were at least three tables in our section that had half eaten food and drinks sitting on it. We ordered and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I got my spiced pumpkin pie shake first, and it was delicious! It tasted like a real pumpkin pie. Next came the food, and I laughed at the amount of turkey in my BLTA Croissant. There were three slices of turkey...just three thin, sad slices. What a rip off. I chose bottomless fruit salad instead of fries, trying to eat a little healthier, and it came drenched in a syrupy sauce. Darn. My husband's Smokin Pepper burger was great and cooked properly, so that's a plus. He was also disappointed in the sugary sweetened fruit salad. By the time we got up to leave, about 40 minutes later, every single table that needed to be bussed when we walked in was STILL dirty. It was pretty unappetizing to look at all the dirty tables while trying to enjoy our meal. Apparently no one was bussing tables; we never saw anyone do it. Overall, we didn't really think it was worth the trip or going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=20
Samantha C.,"New Braunfels, TX",1,29,5,2.0,2/7/2017,"Typically, I love Red Robin's. However, I will not be returning to this location. Our waiter was MIA, never refilled our drinks, and took 30 minutes to return our credit card. The restaurant was nearly empty, so that's no excuse. My burger was mediocre, and that's not something I've ever been able to say about Red Robin before. They charged 5.99 for maybe 10 fried pickle slices. They didn't have my fried green tomatoes.

Mad A.,"Austin, TX",333,116,136,5.0,12/23/2014,"This review needs to go into my category of ""Chain Restaurants That Rock"". I have eaten at Red Robin Burger places from time to time throughout the South and Texas and have never eaten bad food at one. But I saved my review for this location because in my experience it has been the best overall in terms of service and quality of food. It's a tad pricey for a burger but so are a lot of other places.  It could be that my timing is just good because the times I have eaten here has been after the lunchtime crowd or early when they just get started before the big rush hits. Once before the lunch rush and two times afterwards. Never a problem. I always get the same thing at Red Robin. Beer, side salad, and the BURNIN' LOVE BURGER, Babeee! Hell yes! And I always get the DOUBLE! And the meat is delicious.  Here we go so stand witness!: Burnin' Love Burger: crisply fried jalapeno coins, tangy salsa and spicy pepper-jack cheese layered on top of a cayenne-seasoned burger. Lettuce and fresh tomatoes to served on a jalapeno-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo. WHOO! Great flavors and that blend together.... like.. you know.. love. And their fries are damn tasty too. Fresh and hot ! QUICK FRENCH FRY TIP: Get them to bring you a side cup of their Chipotle Mayo to dip those fries instead of ketchup.  And while a love relationship may let you down from time to time.. the Burnin' Love Burger has never disappointed me. In fact, the Burnin' Love Burger has never tried to break into my email account, psychotically spied on my phone text messages, ripped up photos of former girlfriends from YEARS ago when they were tucked out of site in a shoebox with other photos, tried to talk shit about me to my friends, called my momma to complain about me, slashed my car tires, broken into my home, nor tried to cock block a new relationship. Just sayin'. This burger is of the Burnin' Love variety that is selfless and soul nurturing and I  actually feel calm after a late afternoon quickie lunch date. And satisfied too.  Red Robin also keeps a decent line of whiskeys and such. They are not all snobby top end types of liquor ..oh you righteous snobs of such indulgences. But remember that you did come to a burger place. Right? You did remember that? So SHADDAPP!! Please save your faux ""I'm Gordon Ramsey and just watched a cooking show"" review writer bullshit for a more appropriate review. Mmmkaay?  Red Robin gets a five star review for being good at what it does. Ya know..just being a chain burger place and doing it well. Beer, Burger, Fries. And a whiskey afterwards if you want one. Your Yelp buddy Madman will not steer you wrong !  One more thing: Please tell that thar In-N-Out Burger place to get the hell off my lawn!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=20

The Avo-Cobb-O salad was underwhelming and came with two cups of ranch. I'm glad I asked for it on the side. My boyfriend's bacon burger was so loaded with mayo that it was hard to eat and quickly became unappetizing.  My glass of water tasted metallic. The booth we were at was falling apart.

Tami S.,"San Antonio, TX",34,103,79,4.0,8/14/2015,"4 stars for consistency! great food and service!  I'll start by saying that Red robin's burgers are a little toward the pricier side, and the almost $3 drinks add up for a family of 4, but that said, the burgers are always top notch. Great flavor combos, well prepared.  I also like the healthier bun, bun free, side swap options - great if you are trying to shave off some calories. Tonight I decided to try the about-Cobb-o salad instead of a burger. My expectations weren't high - salads seem like a ""throw-away"" item at some restaurants. I end up digging out old, brown pieces of lettuce, or the salad tastes like old, bagged lettuce. it its just plain iceberg - you get the point. BUT what I GOT was a REALLY fresh, and REALLY good salad! The grilled chicken was very flavorful and not the least bit dry or rubbery. and there was a nice variety of lettuce along with generous portions of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced avocado, bacon and blue cheese crumbles. The accompanying garlic toast was also yummy. NICE surprise at a ""burger"" restaurant.

Poor poor poor service and then while waiting for the order I was knocked out of my chair by a busser rolling a cart of ice. I try to look on the bright side, but this was not even average service.

Well it took the waitress over 5 minutes to get to our table to take our drink order. 3 out of 5 in our party where in the RR. She didn't even ask if we know what they might like to drink. When it came time to order she made me think it was cheaper to do order my son an adult meal because I wanted to add an additional chicken finger to the kids meal ($1.50) extra. Then when my mother order she was telling her what she wanted on her burger and she said create your own. Also the fried where over cooked and stale. I had to request a refill instead of it being just done. To have icing on the top I found a HAIR in my ranch for my French fries. I told the manger and he goes ""you want another ranch?"" UM No!!!

If I was them I would have assumed we were homeless and not paid us any mind.  So, in order to escape the bankruptcy inducing food prices at Six Flags, we did not eat at Six Flags. I was STARVING. My sister wanted to half a salad. Boo, you straight trippin. We have a diet thingy going on so she was just looking out, I get it. We settled on bottomless steak fries and half a salad. This appeased my conscience and stomach; I try not to eat too much beef as it is.  Cue waitress, Sarah. On top of EVERYTHING. I've done my share of waitressing back in the day, and I was blown away. Have you ever had a waitress that you had to ask to STOP giving refills of sodas, chips, bottomless fries, etc., because you were done? My glass was never empty, I was never wanting for more fries. My Nazi of a sister commanded her to take away the fries after the 3rd round, saying we'd had enough, while staring directly at me. Geez, I get it. I must add that the Twisted Caesar salad was amaaaaazing, you wouldn't understand how perfectly cooked chicken and macaroni noodles added to a Caesar salad can blow your mind until you've had this. So, we're asked if we need to-go cups as we wrap it up. No thank you, I had more than my usual share of refills of water and fries. My sister picked up the bill, but I was half tempted to throw my card in for a tip. I know my babysis took good care of her, but service like that deserves no less than 40% MINIMUM. I'm still blown away by the attentiveness of this girl. If my usual waitress Tara is absent (who is also magnificent by the way), Sarah, you are my new backup.

Azri G.,"Shinjuku, Japan",34,13,131,4.0,8/18/2014,"I have always received great service at Red Robin, but one instance especially stands out to me. I am a student, so I don't have much money, and my family is rather poor. It is thus very rare for us to have the opportunity to go out to eat at a restaurant together, or for me to be able to go to one with my boyfriend who is also a student. So I was a bit disappointed that one night when we picked up Red Robin for dinner I opened my box at home to discover the burger looking a bit out of order. It was squished, greasy, over cooked, had some things on it I had asked to have taken off, and was overall less than desired. I called Red Robin, not expecting much since we had ordered late and by the time we got home was after 9pm. I was able to speak with a manager who apologized profusely for the food's condition and requested an opportunity to make it up to us. He got my information and had vouchers sent to me in the mail for two free entrees so we would be able to have our dinner together. He had handwritten a note inside to me, and the evidence he had taken the time to take care of me was deeply appreciated. Having as little as we do, it meant so much that he cared enough to make sure we got that dinner. Unfortunately I misplaced the vouchers so I never got to go back, and it is pretty expensive so I would love the opportunity, but this is a great place. I am counting down a star because the original food was displeasing and the price is high (i.e. $5 for a shake).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=60

Dawn E.,"San Antonio, TX",67,8,,3.0,12/27/2011,"We eat here about once every couple of months or so. The food is generally good, and there is a lot of variety, but it is very pricey for what you get. All-you-can-eat fries are not enough to justify the cost of $40+ with tip for two people who get only entrees/burgers and non-alcoholic beverages.  I love that they have so many choices for buns, toppings, and burger/sandwich types. There really is something for everyone from the vegetarian to the total carnivore. Service is usually decent unless they are busy. Then things become chaotic very quickly.  At our most recent visit, the menus were never taken off the table, we had to ask for utensils after our food came, and the ketchup bottle and sweetener tray were empty. I will say, however, that they were very good about keeping our drinks coming and watching to see if we were even close to empty.  Everyone we encountered was friendly as well, which seems to be typical at every Red Robin. I think they were just overwhelmed on this particular visit. The only other complaint I have is that sometimes seating arrangements leave much to be desired.  It's a family restaurant, so I don't expect a romantic atmosphere or total quiet, but I would say that generally it's not a good idea to seat a couple right next to a large party with small children who are of the age where squealing and throwing food are considered ""cute.""  I understand about stations and such, but I do think it's a good idea to take what type of party you are seating into consideration. The restaurant has several areas designed for seating two people or smaller parties. They should use them strategically so big groups get the space they  need and small groups have a little less noise and mess to deal with. Overall I'd recommend it as someplace to eat once in awhile, but I think it's not a good enough value to be a regular place to get a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=60

I never had to ask for a refill and most times I had a new, full glass before I realized I needed it.  Towards the end of the meal my oldest kept asking when the Red Robin would walk around (guy in a suit).

A few minutes later she hand walked the robin over to our table so our son could take a picture with him.  As we prepared to leave she brought me a drink in a to go cup that I hadnt even asked for.  And before you think the service was all that was good about this place, I can tell you that everything that we all had was amazing.

William M.,"Austin, TX",22,72,9,3.0,4/24/2008,I had never heard of Red Robin until they put one in at the Forum. The first time I went I was with my mom and brother and while the food was okay the price was not so thrilling. I think it was like $35+ for the three of us for burgers and drinks. This hasn't kept me from going back but most of the time its because someone else wants to go there.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. It always seems lively and the baseball decorations are pretty neat. This place is usually rather loud because there are lots of families with kids and usually a lot of people there too.  One time my friends and I were sitting near the bar and we got some unintentional entertainment. One of the bartenders thought that one of the taps was out so he stuck a pitcher under it and left it on to clear the lines (I'm assuming). Turns out the tap wasn't empty and because he wasnt' paying attention the pitcher slowly started to fill more and more. Over at our table we were getting more and more excited and then finally it spilled over onto the counter. The bartender turned around and just put his hands on his head with this bewildered expression on his face.  It's a decent burger joint but I would much rather prefer Biff Buzby's which is just down 35 a bit or Chester's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=80
Theresa D.,"Austin, TX",51,38,,4.0,7/25/2011,"We went on a Friday night and even though the place was packed the service was quick and amazingly attentive! Our server got our food and drinks out really quick (except for the ones from the bar, which was not her fault) and even made sure that before we got halfway through our drinks that we had another one waiting. An amazing feat, considering the sheer numbers that were packed in when we were there.  I consider the quality of Red Robin's food in general to be about on par with other mid-level casual restaurants. I enjoy it but it's not THE BEST EVER. But we will always go back. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=80
A. J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,30,,1.0,1/31/2010,"$24.00 for two hamburgers, fries, ice tea and a soda. The burgers were small, the toppings were way overloaded. Good thing they bring more fries.. My sandwich came with a sum total of 9 fries. The sauce was overwhelming, the fries are easily forgetable and the atmosphere unbelievably noisy. Go to Wendy's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=80
Kelly A.,"San Antonio, TX",31,168,,3.0,9/18/2010,"I've read some pretty ugly reviews of Red Robin--and of this particular location--here on Yelp.  I have to say, based on what folks were saying, I was pleasantly surprised.  We had shopped at the nearby Costco and had an old Red Robin giftcard to burn so we decided to try it for dinner. The service was great--my family was greeted with a smile tonight and was instantly whisked off to a booth in the middle of the restaurant.  Our waitress was very friendly and quick--my 6-year-old took a shine to her and gave her her menu art to keep.  ""I'll put it on my refrigerator,"" she said with a smile.  My husband really enjoyed his Royal Red Robin Burger along with a tall frosty mug of Sam Adams.  The fries were fine--not anything to write home about, but tasty with ketchup.  My A1 Peppercorn Burger was okay--the onion hamburger bun tasted kind of weird (medicinal?) and its flavor was overpowering for what would have been a pretty darn good burger.  One of our girls really liked the mac-n-cheese, the other one didn't like it at all.  As far as chains go, this was a good choice for our family.  We will probably return to spend the remaining $25 on our giftcard after our next trip to Costco.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=80
