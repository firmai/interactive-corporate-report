Charles C.,"Wichita, KS",0,9,,5.0,11/27/2017,"My favorite restaurant is Friday's. My favorite item on the menu is the big burgers, because they are big and juicy. I like their wait staff because they are nice and always refill your drinks and it is free. I visited Friday's two weeks ago for my birthday and I got a big juicy burger, fries, and pink lemonade. You should go  there because they are cheap and there food is great and just right. I give it Friday's five stars. -AL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Mariah C.,"Saint Paul, MN",39,5,,5.0,10/5/2017,"This is the best Friday's ever. Especially circa 2013-2015 when all the staff was super cool and sassy. They had sassy black pants on and I love them. Sassy... sassy... sassy!  Everyone should go there now and get all the appetizers. They're endless! Make sure you go to the one on Maize Road in New Market! It's the best! There might be a wait, but its well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Clarisa A.,"Wichita, KS",19,8,2,5.0,8/10/2017,"Honestly we came at 3pm on a weekday so there wasn't many people there when we arrived. However, the service was fantastic, some of the best we've had in Wichita so far!  Our server Jarret (spelling? Sorry!) was very friendly and was eager to make sure our unlimited apps kept coming and were always hot. Our drinks never emptied, and there was always food in front of us. Plus, he stuck around for polite conversation when he definitely didn't have to.  In addition to this, the hostess working that night was also awesome, and made great friends with my daughter. I'll have to see if I can mention this place in one of my upcoming OnlyInKansas articles!  I worship those mozz sticks and potstickers, guys. They're THAT good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Carla A.,"Wichita, KS",296,99,330,4.0,12/8/2016,"Came here for dinner last night, had a ""buy one meal get one free"" coupon. I ordered the grilled chicken with shrimp and cheesy mashed potatoes. Chicken and mashed potatoes were delicious, wasn't a fan of the sauce they put on the shrimp. The entree came with what seemed like 2 servings of mashed potatoes so that was awesome. Wednesday's are $3 Martini nights, so I ordered an extra dirty martini (add olive juice) and it wasn't dirty enough.  I let our server know who was also the bartender, and he brought me an extra shot of olive juice- that was nice! We enjoy coming here but it can be a little on the pricey side. I suggest going when they have drink specials throughout the week and bring a coupon! The coupons are usually in the Wichita Yes newspapers (ones with pink plastic bag).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
John C.,"Wichita, KS",84,48,15,1.0,8/14/2017,"Went here tonight for my wife and I's birthday dinners, needless to say it was a huge let down.  Sad, because it is my wife's favorite restaurant, and the staff just failed epically.  Our food was lukewarm, our meals took 30-45 minutes just to get to our table, and the food was bland.  The waitress managed to barely check on us, which was funny because it was a slow night to begin with.  One of the first nights eating here that no management in sight to check with customers.  Definitely not worth the price we paid for our dinner, we would have been better off eating at McDonalds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Bill S.,"Wichita, KS",390,154,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"I have NO IDEA how this place stays open.  The food quality is HORRIBLE.  The service is HORRIBLE.   The staff looks like they just got out of a puff paint fight at a prison.  There doesn't seem to be any dress code or professionalism whatsoever. When I asked to speak to the manager because my steak came out WELL DONE twice after ordering RARE -- I was told ""she's busy right now."" Take my advice -- go somewhere else",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Megan P.,"Wichita, KS",77,3,,1.0,7/21/2017,Service is crazy slow especially if you're ordering endless apps. Food has gone down hill recently too.   Makes it not even worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Megan K.,"Austin, TX",87,2,,1.0,8/14/2017,This establishment has gone down hill. Went in for lunch on a Monday and the place smelled awful. Sour smelling. Floors were covered with trash and old food. Staff let dirty tables sit without touching them or turning them over the whole time we had lunch. Will never return. Waited 10 minutes before being greeted and hostess even has us if we had seen our waitress.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Ashley A.,"Wichita, KS",87,3,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Went in to eat tonight, it was not busy me and my husband were seated and waited over 20 Mins without even having our server take a drink order before leaving.

Aaron L.,"Wichita, KS",12,91,232,1.0,11/18/2016,TGI Fridays is normally pretty good. Hard to know about this one. Waiter was good. Issue is the bar is slow as molasses and the food never came. We ordered simple appetizers and a sandwich. After 20 minutes without food or even my wife's family we paid for our drinks and left. Ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Heather L.,"Riverside, Wichita, KS",6,4,,2.0,5/7/2017,I had dinner here a couple weeks ago and I wasn't very pleased the waitress that served my family was rude and the prices in my opinion were a bit expensive for the small amount of food I received I was drawn in by the $10 endless appetizers and was unaware that it was ten dollars per person and you couldn't share but it's possible I missed that part in an advertisement but still I think that's ridiculous I will say though the food was good so if you don't mind paying a little extra give it a try but I think I'll pass on ever coming back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Sammy R.,"Temple, TX",4,3,,1.0,1/8/2017,Very slow service. Waiter talked more about working in the bar last night than providing good. French fries were cold. Will not come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita

Richard L.,"Wichita, KS",26,2,,1.0,2/15/2017,So me and my wife went there for lunch a couple of days ago the place was not busy.  Food was cold and when I asked for a refill on my drink I got the check before I got my drink.  The manager appliged and asked me if I wanted a to go cup.  I told her no and me and my wife left.  Never will I go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita

Courtney S.,"Wichita, KS",38,4,,1.0,4/18/2017,"First off let me say that in the past this restaurant was good but whomever they have in charge now needs to go. The wait staff was good but everything from the menu to the food quality was awful. Let's start with the 10.00 all you care to eat Apps...ok the fine print says..10.00 per person at the table. What?? I could see that, if you are going for a game and drinks but to pay that and also eat a meal is ridiculous. My sister ordered Salmon...which she does at tons of restaurants and it was the smallest piece of salmon in existence and it was burned black on the bottom. She sent it back and the second piece was cooked correctly but still half the size of any other restaurant in the city. Another problem was both the broccoli and spinach was flavorless. Also it took forever for them to re-cook it. So, she finally got her meal once we finished. My mother ordered Jack Daniel chicken and shrimp and the shrimp was good but the chicken was tough, stringy and small. They also gave her the wrong sides and had to fix that. I will just say this place has gone so far down hill there isn't anyway to convince me to ever return. One other thing...when an item is sent back, a manager usually comes out...apologizes and makes sure your satisfied..but we never even saw a manager. Crazy!! So, if you are looking for a great evening out, run as far away from this place as you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
J S.,"Denver, CO",0,59,34,2.0,12/17/2015,"Empty, cold and not particularly good service.  Not rude but not attentive.  The food is bland.  My husband got the grilled mahi-mahi, it was completely underwhelming.  I got a burger and it tasted no better than spangles.  My fries were good.  That's it.  The fries were good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Majeedah B.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,4,1.0,6/27/2016,This place has really went downhill in the past few years. Totally empty on a Friday which was surprising for a summer evening at TGI Fridays. Service was slow. Server did her best though she seemed overworked. Food was overpriced and basic. We could've went to Applebee's because the food quality was probably even lower than theirs. My grandpa paid nearly $20 for the salmon that my 6 year old nephew could easily devour. My dad's chicken looked like it came from a TV dinner. Mashed potatoes tasted instant and super dry. Sweet potato fries and strawberry lemonade were the only joy. And to think this was for my little brother's birthday and his first time there. He wasn't impressed. Won't waste our time or gas again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
Theresa M.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,,1.0,6/5/2017,"So all I can say is DO NOT give this place a minute more of your time. Unbelievable! I came in with my family at 6 pm on Sunday Evening. We were one of about 5 tables. More customers followed. It took us 20 minutes to get someone to get our Water and Tea. You would think we would have left but we were tired and hungry. They finally took our order and then the staff disappeared! At the 45 minute mark we asked someone passing by us if they could check on our food. He then disappeared. Our waitress came out of the kitchen to tell us that our food was coming right out. No Food... another employee wandered by and volunteered to get the manager. No Manager. At One hour and 5 minutes we put cash on the table to pay for our Iced Tea and left. Our waitress came running out of the back to see what was happening. We told her that we would not be waiting any longer. She then YELLED at us to say we had ONLY been there 20 minutes and there were people before us. (Which, by the way, were not being served either)  It was NOT 20 minutes it had been over an hour. Very bad form to try and put off on a customer your EPIC Fail. We have had poor service here before but against our better judgment, we gave it one more try.  There are too many good restaurants in Wichita to waste your time on this place. NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita
James P.,"San Antonio, TX",5,7,,4.0,4/6/2015,"Thank you for the great service from Kyli W, fries were not good but then the manger came by and we said the food was great but the FRIES were not to HOT.

Leave the pretzels alone unless you like fried doe.  Never again, felt violated with a scam.  Our group goes out every Friday night and we enjoy west side bars.  Over time we will patronize businesses with considerable long term business.  Nice try Friday's , you had your shot..

Victor G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,3,1.0,12/25/2015,"Won't be dining there again. Service was just ok and not very attentive but when they messed up one of our orders they got right on it and fixed it. The best thing about the food was the appetizers. My steak was like rubber, ribs barely had any meat on them, chicken pasta was more like spaghetti and 5 out of the 7 people in our party just stopped eating. Expensive lesson tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20
Steve S.,"Wichita, KS",0,9,,2.0,2/12/2016,"Was at Friday's 2/06/16. Had coupon for buy Entree and 2 drinks, get 2nd Entree free. Even with this coupon spent 35 bucks. Fridays is pricing their selves out of the market. Food was just  average, service about the same. The grilled Mahi Mahi is considerably smaller serving than picture on menu. Taste was just average. As usual order arrived different than I ordered. Don't mind spending extra if there is value for my dollars. Lots of places to spend my dining dollars, unfortunately Fridays has fallen from the list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20

Eddie M.,"Casper, WY",4,10,3,1.0,3/20/2015,"I've never been told to wait 15-20 minutes when I can visibly see open tables in the restaurant and bar area. When I asked to sit in the bar I was told I'd still have to wait. Then after the mandatory 15 minute wait, I was sat at one of the very bar tables I had been observing as open the whole time. Hope the food doesn't disappoint as bad as the hostess did! Sorry to say but this restaurant seems poorly managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20
Ava M.,"Andover, KS",1,9,,2.0,10/27/2015,Not worth the money.  The average entree price for TGI Fridays is $20.00.  We got the Jack Daniels entrees.  I had the rib eye which came out cold and the sauce was poured over the steak which in turn the sides that i had ordered came in soaked in the sauce.  My husband ordered the steak and shrimp for $27 and the entree didn't come with any shrimp.  The extra charge for a side salad with entree and the kids meals are more expensive than any other chain restaurant in Wichita.  I will not be back again and I would not recommend this restaurant to any body.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20
Luke T.,"Wichita, KS",3,1,,5.0,1/20/2015,Went in late night on a Sunday not long before close. was still treated fantastic and the waiter was fun. Food and drinks were great all the way around. atmosphere was good and clean will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20
Kylie H.,"Haysville, KS",25,2,,1.0,9/21/2014,"I haven't been here for awhile (lived out of the country) and so I was excited when the hubby suggested we come here for dinner! I was horribly disappointed. The menu has changed so much that it's like going to European bistro with steak and burgers. It took all 4 of us about 30 to find anything Ty easy that even sounded halfway appealing. I ended up with the pick 3 a nd share appetizers. It was awful! The pork thai tacos were pure mush abd ask I tasted was hot. No flavor. The mac abd cheese bites were very bland, but the sauce covering then was nice. The meatballs were good. I will not be coming back until their menu changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20

Tyler R.,"Wichita, KS",22,22,,4.0,5/14/2013,"Service was a little slow for being mid afternoon on a workday. Not bad, just slow. Forgot one of my sides and brought us the wrong drinks.

Angel K.,"Mulvane, KS",0,9,,2.0,9/13/2013,"The margaritas all come with an ""orange garnish"" which is disgusting in a strawberry drink. Our potato skins had literally no toppings.

Chance S.,"Orlando, FL",10,96,2,4.0,3/22/2012,"First, I will say that most people I know do not like this place. But I am usually not disappointed when I go there. One reason could be is that I always go to the bar, so I never have to wait for service. The other people I know complain about the service they get at tables. For appetizers I like the pot stickers and spinach dip. For the main meal I like the cajun chicken pasta and the Captain Morgan Caribbean Chicken sandwich. Seriousy, that chicken sandwich is so darn good! The value here is very reasonable. Right now you get to choose one appetizer and one main meal for $10-$15. I think they also have one of the best mojitos in town, but it is a little expensive. I guess my advice to you is, if you require a lot of attention at a restaurant then maybe this is not the place to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wichita?start=20

Jon N.,"Overland Park, KS",0,5,,1.0,4/5/2015,"I've been going to TGI Fridays all over the US for over 15 years. My wife and I were visiting from out of town this weekend and wanted to come here, because we haven't been for awhile. We walked in and were greeted lead to a high table, requested a booth and got one. We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted and waited, and waited. Neither a waiter or waitress came by and said anything to us, like welcome to TGI Fridays, my name is so and so or anything. They didn't even walk by and say be with you in a minute. We were completely ignored by both a waiter and waitress (who kept walking by and scowling at us). After 15 minutes of nothing, we got up and walked out. Someone who I believe was the asst manager thanked us for coming and asked how are food was. I told him that we sat for 15 minutes and no one came by. He wanted to give us a free appetizer card, talk about a slap in the face. I've been in this particular Fridays before, without any problems. I don't what has changed, I may or may not be back.

I have met so many GM's and told them how bad it is only to see they get replaced. They only seem to last 6 mos. or less.  My last meal 2 wks. ago, we tried a couple of Potatoe Skins to start out the dinner--ugh! They were so dry and SALTY we couldn't eat them. The GM named Tom said they have been having kitchen ""issues"". Well, leave the salt OFF the skins! We asked ourselves, how can you screw up skins? Leave it to TGI Friday's!
