Smrithi S.,"Woodinville, WA",12,169,500,4.0,12/4/2017,"We love the California pizza kitchen in Bellevue, and recently were in Northgate mall and when it was time for lunch we didn't even consider any other choice.  We came in for a late lunch, were seated quickly. We ordered Sesame ginger chicken dumplings and a Spicy chipotle chicken pizza on a thin crust. We had not tried the dumplings before and enjoyed it a lot. The pizza is a favoriite and it never disappoints. The friendly quick service and good food made for a great lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Tia M.,"Mukilteo, WA",562,287,216,5.0,10/28/2017,"I've always loved CPK  I'm not a huge fan of Franchise restaurants but this one is definitely an exception!  We stopped for lunch with our son who wanted pizza! We were in the neighborhood for an allergy appointment so why not haven't been in a few years!  My husband ordered the buffalo cauliflower, the boys had pizza and I had the split pea soup and pot stickers. My hubby loved the cauliflower. And for him that's a big deal since he's not a huge vegetable eater! He ate the whole thing!  My lunch was so good. The split pea has always been delicious and is consistent. The pot stickers were so good! The sauce on top was delicious and just the right amount! Our server and her twin sister were awesome! Very attentive and friendly! Glad we revisited CPK after all this time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Cindy F.,"Seattle, WA",118,273,930,5.0,9/30/2017,"TLDR: serves more than pizza. Very filling.  Dining area has a lot of booths and feels almost like a buffet. Average noise level. I'm pretty impressed with the variety in their menu. There are a lot of Asian style foods along with the typical pizzas. There are apps, small plates, and entrees--not just pizza! I honestly had a hard time not ordering everything I saw.  Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, check brought to table, your table will be bused. Complimentary bread and oil dip: bread is crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. Just how I like it. Oil dip is not very salty but is lightly herby. Smashed Chicken Meatball Piadina: Chicken is very tender and I'm a fan of that crushed tomato--tastes very fresh! Salty and tangy flavors blend nicely. Since it comes with soup I recommend you get the half size at lunch hour--a full size is way too filling especially with the soup! Baked Potato Soup: delightfully chunky and melt in your mouth consistency. Has a slight tang to it and is not too salty. Be warned--it's super filling! Sparkling Cranberry Cooler: a bit on sour side but refreshing nonetheless. Not as ""sparkling"" as I though it would be--low carbonation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Roxanna Z.,"Seattle, WA",100,24,263,3.0,1/2/2018,"We got a giftcard to this place so why not come for a mostly free meal? We ordered a pizza and a salad.  Both were very mediocre. Pizza crust was not crispy or chewy. It was just very limp and lifeless. The salad didn't look the freshest and was a little overdressed for my personal liking. Perhaps others enjoy CPK, but I wasn't really impressed having tried some other better pizza places in Seattle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Jaymie S.,"Junction City, OR",113,2,3,5.0,11/18/2017,We brought over 30 people in very last minute and the restaurant cleared a whole section for us so we could sit together and worked hard to get our food to us quickly.

Lauren A.,"Lynnwood, WA",71,59,37,5.0,8/1/2017,"This was our first time here. Food was beyond amazing and everything tasted fresh.  The kids had pizza and said it was ""very good"" I had the pea and barley soup, half Cesar with avocado added and then the fried Mac n' Cheese which was surprisingly yummy.  Service was a bit slow but not the servers (I can't recall her name) fault. From what we could see, there was a bartender and two servers on the floor. Our server did as good a job as possible with the amount of tables she had.  Not sure staffing short was intended though as it was mid afternoon and we came right at the beginning of a ""rush"" our server was polite and best of all, did not hold us hostage with the check.  We felt bad for her even though she never once complained about how busy she was. She handled it like a pro and seemed to enjoy her job.  The other thing I think is worth mentioning: This restaurant does not add the tip like some in this area which shows me some social justice.  We left a 20% tip because of everything listed above.  I'm grateful to have given this place a shot. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Dom F.,"Seattle, WA",66,42,21,2.0,8/24/2017,"We had a small pizza to share,  a Caesar salad to share and we each had a soda with our lunch.  Came out nearly 50 dollars lighter.  Expensive for the quality of the food.  The pizza was light on the toppings (half of it was naked dough) and the Caesar salad was nearly free of croutons.  Next time I'll save money and get more to eat at the food court inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle

Moe C.,"Kirkland, WA",0,9,3,2.0,11/12/2017,"Went back here yesterday for the first time in years, because I was nearby and I remember the BBQ chicken pizza being tasty.  It was OK, but verrry light on the cheese. My friend ordered the spaghetti bolognese, and thought it was pretty ""blah"".  I tasted it and agreed... at $15 for a small plate of pasta plus a ladle or two of sauce, it should have been amazing.  Very little flavor at all, and for a meat sauce, little discernable meat... more like crumbles with some kind filler or extender in them.  The total cost of the ingredients (the noodles are dirt cheap) had to have been under $2, maybe even under $1. There just wasn't any flavor, and so overpriced. Overall, expensive for what it is, and disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle

Everything is crazy expensive compared to what I expected. I've had better pizza for cheaper.

Beth S.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,4,5.0,11/6/2017,"This review is about the Manager of this location, named Louis. My companion has specific dietary needs, and originally wanted the Lemon chicken. When she found out the sauce would be too spicy for her, Louis discussed options for different sauces with her. He clearly wanted to please his customer. When that didn't work out, he suggested another meal that would be more to her liking. She tried something different, but the sauce provided still was too spicy, When she suggested he bring her a plain Caesar dressing, he did so with a smile on his face, I want to compliment him on his patience, goodness of heart, sense of humor, pleasant demeanor, and dedication to his customers. Thank you, Louis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Todd E.,"Camano Island, WA",0,6,,1.0,2/2/2017,"This was the third time we tried this CPK, trying to give it a chance.  The food was so-so, but the ""background"" music was so LOUD that I could not hear my wife sitting across from me!!  It was terrible.  The music in the restrooms was 3 times that LOUD!!  Why? On one visit they said they could not turn it down for some lame reason.  The background music is supposed to be in the background to enhance your dining experience, not ruin it.  The manager here must be near deaf, or just cares about his own desires instead of the comfort of his customers.  Good grief!  The choice of music was also terrible, just junk, people just screaming the words that you couldn't understand.  Everybody has different musical taste but why turn it all the way up so that customers cannot even hear each other?!  We won't be back a fourth time or ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
B N.,"Seattle, WA",0,34,2,1.0,6/13/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen has no business charging premium prices for their food. This is a Cheesecake Factory style Highschool Prom night date restaurant. That being said, I digress... After the friendly hostess seated us. I noticed the restaurant was maybe one third full of customers and they had 3-4 servers so I figured we'd get decent service. I was wrong. For some reason, the server we had seemed relatively attentive and friendly when she first came to take our drink order but then everything went downhill from there. For some reason my drink (and water) took a bit of time to arrive, but that wasn't really a big deal and the server even apologized for the wait. The first problem was when I asked for red paper flakes with my pizza and I never got it. By the time the server arrived to check on us(something she did maybe 1-2 times during our meal and was mostly ignoring us) I was almost done with my pizza and since we were trying to catch a movie I just put down my credit card and didn't mention the missing red pepper flakes. We did ask for a box for my wife's very undercooked and overpriced gluten free pizza; figuring we'd cook it more later at home. We thought about sending her pizza back, but we didn't want to miss our movie.  Well, we never got the box and on top of that the server had charged me for someone else's pizza and I had to flag down the friendly and helpful hostess to get our box and get our bill fixed. After our bill was mostly fixed we received a very halfhearted apology from our server and $50 later; we left.  Yeah that's right. 2 very small gluten free pizzas, no appetizers, a coke ($3.50) and a moscow mule(10 bucks) All of this was more than 50 dollars... Seattle isn't known for their pizza, but there are plenty of places that offer cheaper and higher quality gluten free pizza and have better service. On top of all that my stomach felt not so great afterward.  Save your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Jenny L.,"Murrieta, CA",148,44,73,5.0,12/22/2016,I love the sangrias at CPK! They are all awesome but the blood orange is my favorite. All of the pizzas are awesome as well.

Ayla R.,"Seattle, WA",172,289,129,2.0,6/19/2017,"As a long-time lover of CPK, I can't explain my extreme disappointment with this location. My friend, Rach and I wanted salads and wine before a little shopping and I insisted on my favorite salad spot, CPK. We walked in and no one was at the host stand, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, we decided to sit at the bar top. We were greeted by the enthusiastic and hospitable, Richard. He greeted us with menus and a smile then hurried over to run food. Clearly understaffed, we watched 2 servers (and 2 trainees..) Sprint around the restaurant, trying to give sufficient service.  We ordered drinks and salads and Richard was friendly and attentive, but clearly brief due to being stretched to thin. Our drinks came out perfect and we enjoyed them thoroughly. The girl with the two trainees was near, so we asked her for water and she said she would deliver them soon. She then within earshot said 'sometimes guests who aren't yours will bug you for things and you have deal with it'. Not exactly a comment appreciated by the ones who asked it. The AGM with a branded coat hardly noticed any of the customer service faux paus occurring around him.   Our food came out and it was consistently good on the way CPK is, which was great and appreciated. Overall, we were underwhelmed by the service of everyone except our bartender. I definitely won't be rushing back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
V V.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,1,1.0,4/29/2017,We got one veggie and one bbq chicken pizza. They both tasted burnt. Feel like they were in the oven way too long. Even then the pizza just tasted nasty.

This CPK was 2 thumbs down, the service was by far, the worst. The restaurant was empty n it took 10 minutes to get seated. I never got my bread, it took forever to refill my drink.

Channing C.,"Federal Way, WA",155,236,663,2.0,2/6/2017,"Two stars. Why oh why? Well, mostly due to the poor service. Came here with a friend a couple of weekends ago and thought that I would have the usual CPK experience, but unfortunately, I was agitated for most of the time. What's crazy is that the place wasn't even packed and busy so I don't understand the breakdown. We our drinks came out quickly of course, then we ordered our food. As I was finishing my drink the waiter asked us after a long period of time, if we wanted some bread and dipping oil. We accepted, but didn't see the bread until, I kid you not, seconds before our food came out. So it was kinda like, what was the point of that? When the waiter put the bread on the table, he also put two WET plates in front of us then walked away. We couldn't believe it. I had to call him back and ask him to give us dry plates for our stale and hard bread. Once the food came out, I was already ready to leave. I had the jambalaya fettuccine. It was ok but I felt that they overdid the blackened aspect of the meat and the noodle to meat ratio was off. CPK is a chain so I won't vow to never return but hopefully this location can have better service next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle
Ally-Marie B.,"Kirkland, WA",801,275,238,3.0,1/25/2015,"The service and food I recieved was phenomenal; worth four stars, but when I was sitting at the bar on a busy Friday afternoon, I had a chance to observe how they run the kitchen and their staff.....not five stars.  There were probably 30 or so guests sitting in the dining area and only two servers and a manager-looking type woman....who didn't do much of anything even though she was frantically running around.  My Food: Starter- the guacamole  ($3.99) The portion was small for the hoard of chips that accompanied it. But it was very tasty. Up the portion and I would eat it for lunch everyday. Entree: half of the Asian Chicken Salad ($9.99) very good, I loved the crunch it had and the peanut sauce. Maybe a bit on the salty side, but I ate it all; I was hungry.  Monica was my server, but she was in a rush to assist her dining room guests so I was mostly assisted by the manager on duty.  Every time Monica asked the manager for help with an easy task, the manager would either attempt it and fail, or ignore her request all together. Even the hostess was able to dart to the kitchen and run some food!!!!!  At one point, the manager was ringing a to go order with the guest standing right there, and had some issue with the cash register! Wouldn't you know it, even though she was slammed, Monica stepped in and finished the transaction.  I also noticed that the hot pizzas were sitting out, waiting to be delivered for too long. No one was to blame as the two servers were trying to tackle the near impossible.  It's employees like Monica that really keep a restaurant in businesss. If her pace had slowed in the least, it would have resulted in angry customers and cold food. Even though she didn't order or deliver my food (the manager did), she was still very kind and checked in with me enough for me to tip her handsomely and give her an honest compliment on her work ethic.  Contrastingly, it's people like this manager that can drag a business down. More servers should be hired on the weekend so the employees don't experience burnout and the guests are happily fulfilled. Also, the manager should know how to do almost every task to better support the employees....just in case it gets busy (like today). Running food, taking orders, making drinks and correctly ringing to-go orders.  They really have great food, but the management side of things needs to shape up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle

Reina Q.,"Oakland, CA",1,96,105,1.0,2/10/2017,"Very disappointed with my experience at this location and I haven't been here long enough to get my food? I came in to place a to-go order (the greeter is exceedingly pleasant and helpful- young, brunette- I should ask for her name), the woman who takes the orders (Michaella?) is apparently too busy being idle to acknowledge or assist me in any way. She took so long that I asked the TWO other employees at the bar for help (crickets) because no one speaks except the greeter? So, to my rescue, the exceedingly polite young greeter placed my order. I hesitate to give one star, but the nice receptionist prevented me from leaving all together. If ordering here wasn't a necessity, I would leave. I will NEVER return. I won't make assumptions as to why I'm being ignored, however, no one else here seems to be suffering from a lack of polite/quick service.

Andrew F.,"Seattle, WA",11,21,,1.0,5/31/2016,"Wow!  What a strange and horrible experience! I've been a long-time CPK fan -- particularly when traveling for business, when you want to go somewhere that is going to have quickly served at least pretty good food that isn't going to get you a call from the accountant after you submit your expense report.  CPK has been that place for me (kudos to the Oak Brook, Illinois location, where I've spent many a dinner after a day at a local client site). So, I know what to expect, as do my wife and kids.  But, noooooo.  Not this time.  While the food was most definitely sub-par (the mac and cheese, which is usually good, was flavorless and the salmon salad was pretty much inedible), we going to talk about something else today.  What might that be?  Why, our waiter, of course. In short, I'm really not even sure how to explain what went wrong.  I actually found myself mentally trying to put the story together prior to asking for the manager to come by, and I found that nothing I could say would really do justice to the situation. He took our drink order.  No drinks appeared.  After quite a while, we nicely asked for our drinks.  He asked what we ordered.  Told him again.  No drinks.  But he spent an inordinate amount of time at the terminal, flipping through his pad and punching things into the computer. He brings bread to the table, which is immediately consumed by hungry family. Still no drinks. Finally came by to take our food order.  That took a while. Goes directly to another table to take their order, rather than punching our order into the computer.  He's there for a loooong time. One drink appears! We ask for the rest of the drinks.  He asks what we ordered. We ask for more bread. YAY!  The kids' meals appear!  Nope.  They're kids meals, but not for our kids.  He takes them away and sort of starts offering them to the occupants of his various tables.  They appeared to eventually find a home in front of some children a few tables away. Still no food.  And one drink.  We ask for drinks again.  Waiter asks what kind of tea my wife had ordered, which we took as a good sign that he at least remembered she ordered tea. Drinks appear! We see waiter sort of aimless walking around with a plate of bread.  Eventually he diverts to our table.  Yes!  Bread!  Three pieces for four people. Waited a while longer, and the food appears.  See above note about quality of the food). I think we must have had ""a look"" on our faces, because one of the other waitstaff was walking by and stopped.  She wanted to know if everything was OK.  No, she wasn't the manager.  I could only incoherently mumble something about ""bad"" due to no clear manner of explaining the dystopian dining situation in which we'd found ourselves. We ate what we could that was sort of edible.  Shared our plates to ensure that nobody left too hungry -- you know, like a pack of leopards around a fallen gazelle.  Somebody else was clearing our table, when our waiter appears. . . with a caesar salad.  No, we didn't order it.  He looks confused.  Or crestfallen.  Or crestfused.  Whatever.  We had't ordered it. He finally asks if we want refills on our drinks. The manager comped the entire meal.  We didn't even have to ask her to do so or ask her to come to the table.  At some point she just figured out what was going on.  Sort of like when you pass an accident and see everybody standing by their cars on the side of the highway.  I think that's pretty much what she saw going on at our table. We're probably not going to be back for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=20
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898,3.0,12/12/2015,"How I heard of this place: I fail to recall how, or when I first heard of CPK, but this was my first time at the Northgate establishment, thanks to Veteran's Day deals offered for a good friend and an invitation extended to us. Type of cuisine: ""hand-tossed artisan pizzas, classic, unique pastas and salads, fresh, seasonally inspired ingredients, hand shaken cocktails, premium wines and craft beers."" Ambiance: Sparse, dimly lit and clean, the streamlined space is perfect for a casual date, a spontaneous family dinner, and a casual go-to for an impromptu dinner out while shopping. What I ordered: The ending to our Veteran's Day of eating out, I opted for a simple Asparagus and Arugula Salad ($5.95) tossed in housemate lemon vinaigrette with sun-dried tomatoes, toasted almonds and shaved parmesan. Garlic Cream Fettuccine and Chicken (free for Veteran's), ""the ultimate roasted garlic Parmesan cream sauce"" for my husband, and The Original BBQ Chicken (free for Veteran's), ""legendary BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, red onions and cilantro"" for our friend. What I loved: The lemony tartness paired with the salty goodness of the Parmesan in the Asparagus +Arugula Salad.

I finally received the pizzas and returned to work where we noticed it didn't look as if there was any cheese on them. I called to ask about it and whoever I spoke to, I believe it was the manager, basically told me he had seen the pizzas go out and they did in fact have cheese.

Victoria G.,"Seattle, WA",1,37,8,1.0,4/23/2016,"My bf and I came here for lunch today. I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine while he had the Chicken Club with baked potato soup. We shared a sangria flight special they had.  There were a few things wrong with our visit. Where to start... We wanted to sit outside and asked if they would turn on the outdoor heater. It was a little brisk out but still a beautiful day. One waiter said sure but they only turn them on in the evenings so she'd have to get someone to turn it on. Once we were seated, another waiter said they aren't working so great right now, so they won't turn it on. Okay... I waited 15 minutes for the bread basket, and when I realized after 3 times the waitress stopped by that it wasn't coming, I asked if they still offer it. She said yes and brought it out a few minutes later. My pasta dish was ok, not great but not bad. I'd give that 3 stars.  The sangria flight was interesting to try, although nothing I would order again. His soup was ok, a little salty and bland though. The sandwich was good, but about 3 bites in he felt a sharp piece of plastic in it. We let the waiter know and she had the sandwich remade, but not to our specifications to accommodate food allergies.  When we asked for the check, she happily told us she didn't charge us for the second sandwich/soup combo - the one we had to send back because they made it wrong. But she still charged us for the first one - the one that we sent back because it had bits of plastic in it. Why would we pay for either of them?? We asked her to please remove the charge for the sandwich, not the soup which he ate, and explained why. She did that, but we're baffled as to why we had to ask.

They make a salad my wife likes (BBQ chicken) and I find their fish tacos and chicken chimichuri tolerable. They have a rewards program that tosses us a discount now and again. There are worse things.  This particular location has an issue with one or more of their floor drains. When they go without being cleaned and sanitized for a while, they give off a particular odor, something between rotting garbage and somebody else's feet. Please just get it done guys. A couple buckets of hot sanitizer and a brush will have it done in ten minutes. Service is usually ok, sometimes better than ok. I usually get better service at the bar, which has the additional benefit of getting you out of range of the Chuckie Cheese refugees screaming and messing the booths in other parts of the restaurant.

Kimberly B.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,,1.0,6/29/2017,"I will never come here again. Jerby was the WORST server I have ever had. There were hardly any other people there and she came to our table twice. She took our order and checked on us once.  My husband and I waited and waited for water. When we finally received our pizzas, I was so sad to see that my pizza was cold and under cooked. I was so hungry by the time I received my food that I tried to just eat it. When Jerby came to FINALLY  check on us we asked her for some pepper flakes, a box and our check. she NEVER came back. Instead she was texting on her phone and laughing and ignoring us. She was literally standing by the computer screen texting for 20mins. Unbelievable. I mean, if you're going to text and ignore customers, at least go in the kitchen to do it. We had to ask the hostess to help us since Jerby never came back. The hostess was friendly and prompt and asked Jerby for our check, when we got our check she had charged us for an extra pizza. We asked to have it corrected and even then she took off the cheaper pizza, (which was mine) and left the more expensive pizza, (not ours) on our bill.

Alexander H.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,3.0,1/14/2017,"This restaurant serves very hearty and rich foods. Every bite is dripping with some butter or cheese. Basically, not a place to go if one is being mindful of some sort of body transforming New Year's resolution. However, with that being said, this review is for a ""Rich and Hearty Pizza"" restaurant. I had ordered the Rib Eye steak and the jambalaya. This place is not a great place to get a good steak, but they'll charge steak house rates. (Price of the steak was $27.99) The meat was tough and lacked flavor. I ordered the steak done medium well and there was ""rare"" blood pooling on the curls of the steak. I suppose the brick of cheese set on top of the steak was intended to mask the low quality of the cut, but it really didn't help. I was basically eating cheesy rib eye steak. Now onto the Jambalaya, the dish wasn't too bad. Every bite was an explosion of flavor down down to the last bit. Some may enjoy this sort of flavoring, but I just felt it was over powering the good ingredients. The Jambalaya had shrimp, crawfish, sausage, and a tasty pasta. I couldn't finish the dish, but the first few bites were very delicious. I don't want to knock this restaurant due to it not appealing to my palette, but just know that this place serves very rich and hearty foods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=20

It took a while for our waiter to make his way over to us, but he made up for the initial delay with friendly service and attention throughout our meal. So, what can I say... if you've been to CPK, then you know their food is solid. The kids enjoyed their fusilli with cream sauce, barbeque chicken pizza and pepperoni pizza (picky eater child, of course).

The pizza itself wasn't spicy, BUT I can eat really spicy food, so it may be spicy to some of you who are reading this. The sauce had this kick, not right when you eat it, but after a short while.

Put the bread in the toaster and the turkey in the microwave for a couple of minutes. Major improvement!  Nice moist sandwich that had good flavor.

The server explained the menu because it was the first day they launched new food on the menu. She introduced us a shrimp apertizer and assisted us with the decision of our pizza order. She was very friendly and resourceful. Food 4 Stars My sister had their lemonade. According to her, it was ok! We had Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizer. According to the server, it's one of the most dishes. However, we were not impressed. We felt that we've had better shrimp dishes. We also had hummus. I felt that the hummus was a little too watery for me. Both my sister and I enjoyed the pesto pasta and BBQ chicken pizza. I thought the BBQ chicken pizza with smoky bacon was a good touch.

Good: The mushroom pizza was very good when adding the truffle oil. If I ordered it again, I would add arugula.  The managers buzzing around were very friendly and on top of things. Surprisingly good beer selection, but you have to ask about what's on tap.  Most of the staff I encountered was very friendly.  Free wifi is always a bonus.  Meh:  The uniforms are so dated. The headsets that all servers and managers wear are really cheesy, bordering on annoying. No, not bordering on - they are really annoying. No real reason why, jmho.  Bad: My server said I had poor taste because I like mushrooms and truffles. I get it was joking around, but inappropriate.  The interior of the restaurant is incredibly dated, to the point of being uncomfortable. It felt like a Denny's with all the low booths and bad design. I'm not an interior decorator, so I can't put my finger on it, other than do say it could use refreshing.  The truffle oil is very expensive and tasted like a 'fake' truffle oil. It was so strong that I assume it was enhanced with synthetic scent/flavor.  With 5 tables or so in the entire place, I fell victim to mediocre distracted service. Two basic requests were forgotten (water and condiments).  Only the manager knew what was in a basic bar drink that was ordered. The first thing a bartender should learn are things like a Collins, a press, a sour, a spritzer... No happy hour.  I'm not one that frequents chains like this, but didn't know the area and needed something reliable and easy to navigate.  I remember visiting early CPKs years and years ago when they first opened in SoCal, and I was happy to see that the pizza quality was still as good as remembered, again, understanding what it is.

I never gave it a second thought but now when I read the menu, I imagine a blonde surfer dude advertising the healthy and fresh California-style of food you came to this restaurant for! My favorites at this restaurant remain the thai crunch salad, which I resorted to after they took away the miso seafood salad. I still mourn the loss of that salad. I'm adventurous with pizzas, but I like the pear and gorgonzola or the thai chicken. I'm pretty sure there used to be a peking duck that was great but not on the menu anymore. That's another thing I'm disappointed about of CPK. I've been going here since my childhood because it's one of the few non-asian restaurants my chinese food eating mom liked. I've seen their menu change a lot in recent years and much of what I grew to love is gone. It's sad. I have a feeling their consolidating their menu to get rid of ingredients that were only used in certain entrees and thus weren't price effective to keep in the kitchen. Having crab just for one salad or duck just for one pizza probably isn't smart.  CPK isn't a very expensive restaurant, and their pizzas seem to have gotten bigger even though the price hasn't changed much.

The peppers, bacon and cheese complimented the pizza well and I got over it. My girlfriend ordered their ever famous BBQ pizza and I was a fan of it, the sauce was sweet and cheese/onions were very good with this.

I have been before quite a lot, though i just don't like supporting chain restaurants as much which is why i may sound turned off to it but here is what you should know.. The macaroni and cheese, which is on the kids menu but adults can still order it, is amazing. At my old job i worked right across the street from this place and ate it all the time.  Second off- the pizza sauce is something that needs to be mentioned. There is something special about this sauce, it has a sweet taste to it that is just really enjoyable.. I love the pizza because of this. Third- Lastly i had the Sun dried pesto penne which was so so delightful. The noodles were soft and creamy, the tomatoes were flavorful and it was nice and light. The portions are friendly so i had some to take home. The service has also been pretty good too. When i was there with the kids our waiter was very attentive to our needs and lightly joked around with us which i liked.

Alli D.,"Seattle, WA",90,487,20,3.0,3/10/2009,"After three of us sat down to eat lunch here, we realized we were already having pizza for dinner that same night. Durrrr....so we had to improvise. A bevvy of appetizers it would be! We shared the Spinach Artichoke Dip, the BBQ Chicken salad, and got a cup of soup each.  The dip was served with tortilla chips. In my humble opinion, spinach dip goes better with pita bread or crackers, but it was cheesy and hot and yummy. The salad was a little low on lettuce but pretty good, especially because it had little tortilla strips on top for crunch. (Apparently they like using chips in their dishes!) I had the split pea soup, which was nothing like my Mama's but definitely edible.  Grand total was $40 before tip, which seems a bit much for how little we got. Pizza is a far better way to spend your money here; too bad we didn't think of that before we walked in the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=120
Rosie R.,"Seattle, WA",204,123,14,3.0,5/14/2009,"What happened to my thank you card? I'll dispense with the criticism first. There is some sort of promotion going on right now at CPKs that involve a thank you card that can only be opened on your next visit (to reveal some variable prize, I presume). We were pleasant. We did not complain, and in fact embarrassingly raved about the salad. But for some reason, Josh, our waiter, thought us unfit for a thank you card, when the booths on either side of us received them. Tsk, tsk, Josh. You should never let a guest feel unequal to other guests.  Now that THAT is out of my system. YUM: any assortment of pizzas (Jamaican Jerk, Thai chicken, Wild Mushroom, many others) BOMB: their salads! I would eat salads ALWAYS if I could make them like this at home (with minimal effort, of course). Highly recommended: Miso Seafood (you can get it down-charged to chicken instead) and Thai Crunch. Why revel in a chain restaurant when there are many wonderful small or local pizza joints, you ask? Well, when I want something filling, and not food coma-inducing, this is the sort of thing I go for (either this or a bun salad at a Vietnamese joint, depending on my mood): consistently non-greasy dough, and a variety of filling and tasty salads.  Plus, they regularly do carry-out, which is great when I am lazy, don't want to indulge in fast food, and forget that I might be in a personal recession.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=120

We are taken to our table and not even seated yet when our servers pops over and asks if we'd like anything to drink, I'm caught a little off guard, I'd like to take my coat off first and sit down before I'm asked such a tough question as what would you like to drink.  We send her off to find water for us and finally sit down. The menu pretty much looks the same as it did 9 years ago with a few changes.  Since my morning was stressful I decided a cocktail was in order, I went with a raspberry mojito.  It took forever to arrive and I kind of wish it didn't it was more like a raspberry sugar water with mint in it no bueno. Now on to the food.  We started with the Tuscan hummus which was actually rather tasty.  They make theirs with white beans and it had a nice hint of garlic and lemon nothing was too over powering and the warm pizza pita bread they served with it was yummy, however I could have done with out the fresh tomatoes served on top they were a bit to watery for me. I decided on a half Chinese chicken salad and it was drenched in dressing and not in a good way either.  The lettuce, carrots and cilantro that weren't drenched did seem to be pretty fresh and tasty.  If I ever order it again I'd over dressing on the side, I did enjoy the dressing but sometimes too much of a good thing is bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140

Fast, efficient and friendly wait staff 3. A wide variety of outstanding gourmet pizzas. If you're a real carnivore, you should definitely try The Sicilian with its marinara sauce, sweet Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, salami, fontina, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Topped with oregano and basil. That was one of my favorites before I gave up pork and beef.

Geoff N.,"Seattle, WA",77,106,17,3.0,10/26/2006,"Today I went to CPK for lunch for the first time in years. The restaurant used to be a standard dining location for me when I was living in L.A., especially since several of my friends worked there at the time. Being that it had been a while, I decided to order my old standard. My friends and I shared the spinach dip as an appetizer and I had the chicken Caesar focaccia sandwich with tortilla soup. The food was more or less as I remember it. The spinach dip is gooey, rather than chunky, which makes it easier for dipping. Since going to CPK last, I have become accustomed to a homemade spinach artichoke dip that has much more substance to it. Still, the CPK variety is tasty, though we ran out of dip before we ran out of chips, which is kind of annoying. The sandwich didn't seem to be as Caesar-y as it used to be. In fact, it seemed more like a standard chicken sandwich with romaine lettuce. If I order something called a chicken Caesar sandwich, I would hope for a little more dressing, anchovies or a knife in the back or something. The tortilla soup also seems to have evolved. In my opinion, it now contains entirely too much corn. A little bit is okay, but this was like corn chowder. I dislike corn when it's not on the cob. It especially bothers me in soup for the same reason the tapioca balls in bubble tea bug me. Simply put, it makes me feel like I am eating boogers or an equally revolting, chewy substance of approximately nostril size. The soup was tasty apart from the corn and being at CPK brought back memories of college.

That's not me, I always share! Also, since when can I eat an entire pizza in one sitting (regardless of its size)? Wow. So I give it four stars. I would give it five if it were a slight bit cheaper, because for a medium-ish smaller size pizza, $13 is a bit much. Guess it is all about quality not quantity, and they do have plenty of quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=160

Their drinks are nice, I saw the girl who was making them. She was a bit heavy handed at pouring (nice touch)! LOL! You can also get sugar free flavored teas! I have no idea why, but I never have ordered their pizza in house. It has been either take out, or the frozen ones at the store! Hahahah! Ok so today the fiance wanted to treat me out to lunch. We both ordered the BBQ chopped chicken salad. Our favorite. Since I have been cutting out certain things from my diet, I ordered it without the tortilla strips, and no avocado, with balsamic dressing on the side. The waitress was very accommodating, not flinching once.  We also got an order of the Singapore Rolls, (again due to my cutting back). The salad was terrific. We both found that it didn't need the dressing and was good the way it was. Mine came with a lime wedge so I happily squeezed away. Mine came with avocado, but oh well, I love it and thought it was a nice treat. The lunch portion was just about the right size, I ate a bit more than half and boxed the rest. The Singapore Shrimp Rolls were just a glorified Goi Cuon (Vietnamese salad rolls), though the noodles were tossed in a dressing, and it had different veggies. The slaw that came with it was pretty tasty. We liked it ok. Not as good as mine, but it is good to see people's interpretation of things. LOL! My fiance also thoroughly enjoyed his Coconut Mojito. I had a few sips, and like I said it was a nice strong drink. The staff were all friendly and nice. I'd rather go here than Azteca's, Stanford's, and Macaroni Grill.

I was pleasantly surprised at the menu -- pizza (duh), pastas of all kinds, fresh salads, and a variety of appetizers including egg rolls, tuscan hummus, and crab cakes.  Although several of the cheesy pastas being inhaled around me were calling my name, I went with my gut and chose the Waldorf Salad, which is my favorite kind of salad -- sweet dressing, with nuts, apples, grapes, crumbled cheese, and chicken.   This salad was exactly what I needed, because as the weather gets colder, I seem to eat take-out much more than I should!  :)  Our wonderful, lovely server in the bar recommended the ""Regular"" portion ($2 less) because the large was evidently HUUUGE, and my ""regular"" size was more than enough to fill me up! Kim got the hummus (too garlic-y and tangy for my taste) with warm, soft delicious pita triangles, of which I ate many.   All in all, it ended one of my favorite kind of days -- a great meal and productive shopping trip!  And the ONLY thing I bought for myself was a wallet and this salad, huzzah!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=80

We order 2 full pizzas and a salad. They never did correct the drink order. - No bread brought to the table (forgot about this until their national Web page asked if the free bread was brought as it should be). - 10:05p waitress #1 brings salad and pizzas together, announcing that restaurant is closing.  I get it:  everyone wants to go home.  you don't really want us here... despite the fact you seated us. But salads are traditionally appetizers and brought before the meal. thanks for trying to speed us along by bringing it all at once, but... never mind.

I have sampled numerous items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The salads are delish and large in portions...event the half salads are decent sizes and filling. The Chinese chicken salad is so good! They also have a new entree featuring the cedar plank salmon with corn succotash and I thought it was to die for. Personally it had the right amount of spice, it was cooked perfectly, and the fish was just delicious. I couldn't stop talking about it after I left. $18 for that dish and I thought it was worth it.  I also like the fact that they have a separate booklet that helps you compare nutrition facts and calories for those who are dieting. Because I don't get the pizza, I can say I haven't had any issues with greasiness or oily foods. Everything seems so fresh and tastes good.

He removed the salad from our bill and gave us a second salad of the one we ordered at no charge but it didn't come out until it was time to leave (we told the waiter we only had one hour and we where there for lunch) he boxed it for us. We asked the waiter for water for some of late arrivers but it never came. We also asked for more silver wear and it never came (she ended up eating her salad with a salad spoon). We realized 10 min into the meal we needed another pizza but we couldn't get it order because the waiter didn't come by in time to put the order in.

But I worked at the mall for about a year and a half, and if I wanted to get food after work at someplace a bit nicer than the food court or Chipotle, this was one of the better options. I would not recommend it for PIZZA pizza (tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni, GREASE) but they do have a lot of interesting specialty pizzas. The menu is quite large and diverse. It does kind of have that overall blandness that I've come to associate with chain restaurants -- while everything I've tried is good, nothing was particularly exciting or unexpected. Actually, that's not true -- they have pizzas with salad ON THEM. That's pretty unusual, unless it's a California thing; I wouldn't know. I haven't tried one because they just sound weird. The personal pizza is usually a bit too big for me to eat in one sitting, but leftovers are nice. It's worth getting a box for your leftovers instead of stuffing yourself here, because they have good desserts. Key Lime Piiiieeeee.... The drinks are also good. I love love love their dessert coffee drink Almond Joy, which includes amaretto, coconut rum and chocolate syrup. Yummmm. Here's the thing that always bothers me about this place, though. They have a very strange service policy, that apparently is enforced by corporate, that I don't like. Servers all introduce themselves in their flat, scripted way (""Hi! I'm John and I'll be serving you tonight! Can I tell you about our specials?"") and every time I've eaten there, the manager on duty has come around at least once during the meal and asked us how we are doing. This might seem like a nice touch, but it feels very corporate-enforced. I've had two separate managers do this, a man and a woman, and both of them seemed almost suspicious of their servers. ""Is everything okay? Reeeally?"" It was a weird attitude to have, because we were doing just fine, and it made me feel like there was something weird going on except that this seems to happen every time (I've asked some co-workers if they had that happen too, and they all did.) So, Corporate, if you're reading this, STOP MAKING THEM DO IT! It's really annoying and weird. The food and drinks are quite good, but the most this place will get is four stars (really 3.5) because of the weird service issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=80
Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30,4.0,4/14/2011,"I have been to this particular location a few times, but I have been to CPK's all over, and always have a similar experience. The service is good, and the food is good. Yes, they are somewhat overpriced. Which is probably part of the reason I don't go here that often.  BUT, they have good pizza. And in the end, that is all that really matters. I LOVE their honey wheat crust. It is especially good with the chicken club pizza, which has bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and lettuce and mayo. It sounds weird, but is actually delicious! I am also a huge fan of their thin crust Sicilian pizza. Oddly enough, their signature bbq chicken pizza isn't that great.  I think the only bad experience I ever had here is that I ordered an iced tea, and I took a drink and it tasted awful. So I told my waitress that it tasted funny, she instead brought me a diet coke, and in a few minutes came back to let me know that it turns out someone had accidentally made iced coffee instead of iced tea. The fact that she looked into it, and fixed the problem was really awesome.  The wait can be kind of long on the weekends, but it has a pretty odd location at North Gate, so sadly it doesn't get as much business as it should.

Chad K.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",0,4,,4.0,11/11/2015,"It's hard for me to decide how many stars to give. My most recent visit went from hugely disappointing to remarkable in the span of 10 minutes. Let me explain. I get the Thai chicken pizza nearly every time, and nearly every time it's great. Except once. After placing my order and waxing effusive to my friend about how incredible the Thai chicken pizzas are, the waiter dropped off a dry, sad looking, flat, flimsy pie absent of adequate sauce or toppings. My reaction was mildly visceral. I took one bite. To be fair, it tasted marginally better than it looked. But it was not nearly as good as I remembered. A 3 out of 10 at best. Now I hardly ever send food back. Let's just say I'm paranoid about disgruntled kitchen crews adding foreign ""toppings"" to my order. But today, a CPK District Manager happened to be making the rounds, asking how everyone's food was. When she approached our table, I told her my dish was ""OK, but it used to be really good in the past."" She apologized and said: ""Let me take care of that for you,"" and whisked the sorry thing away. About 10 minutes later she returned, apologizing again for the wait. And what she placed in front of me was nothing short of legendary. The crust was perfect. The sauce was perfect. The toppings were piled comically high. It looked almost too good to eat. But I ate it. And it was the one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Now she didn't say so, but I think the DM made my pizza that day. But whoever made it got it right.

The size is exactly the same as the frozen version and taste pretty much the same.  I love cajun food and perhaps CPK isn't the place to order that but I thought I'd give the jambalaya fettuccine a try.

Amy L.,"Kenmore, WA",20,249,38,3.0,7/10/2011,"Sometimes you just need the salty cheesy carb-bomb that is the thai pizza at California Pizza Kitchen, or as my family inexplicably calls it ""California Pizza Chicken."" While their frozen sicilian pizza is in my opinion the only frozen pizza worth buying, the frozen version of their thai pizza is just gross in comparison to the one you get in the restaurant. I've never had a problem with the service at the Northgate location but then again it's a CPK it's not like I'm expecting the world. :) The waiter was friendly and personable, though I did have on nit to pick. My fiancee ordered the wedge salad, I ordered the half roasted vegetable salad and we ordered the Thai pizza. For some reason only his salad came before the pizza despite the fact that I was the one who actually put in the pizza order. Fortunately the pizza was screaming hot so I wasn't forced to deciding between hot pizza and my salad. One thing I love about CPK is their salads. They definitely aren't really for those people watching their diets, a full size salad with chicken will usually clock in at about 1000 calories but they are super delicious. I think their salads, and more specifically the avocado, would be the reason that their prices are high for what they offer. In Washington I've only been to the Bellevue, Tukwila, and Northgate locations but they without fail always have perfectly ripe, bright green avocado and it doesn't taste like it was soaked in preservatives or lime. They must throw out 2 avocados for every 1 that they use or else they have some kind of food science sorcery that lets them preserve the avocado without making it taste like they did. If you work near a CPK and don't mind the prices they offer great to-go service. You have the choice to order online or by phone and either walk-in or at some locations they have car-side service where they just bring it out to your car. When I went to pick up my food from the Tukwila location they always offered me a drink while I waited if I showed up before the specified time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=100

I presented a free small cravings coupon that I obtained through the bite of Seattle. I ordered the hummus plate, and it was real good. The first time I tried the hummus, was at the bite of Seattle. So good job on the marketing there! Then going on to the main event, I always order and swear by this dish: Portobello mushroom ravioli with cream sauce. The serving may not look so big, but I can never finish it. The ravioli is big enough to half it and take bites from there. Service wise, seems like they know their stuff and good customer service. As we were leaving we were handed these special coupons that we had to go back and dine to redeem. Once again good idea!

I'm pretty impressed with the variety in their menu. There are a lot of Asian style foods along with the typical pizzas. There are apps, small plates, and entrees--not just pizza! I honestly had a hard time not ordering everything I saw.  Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, check brought to table, your table will be bused. Complimentary bread and oil dip: bread is crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. Just how I like it. Oil dip is not very salty but is lightly herby. Smashed Chicken Meatball Piadina: Chicken is very tender and I'm a fan of that crushed tomato--tastes very fresh! Salty and tangy flavors blend nicely. Since it comes with soup I recommend you get the half size at lunch hour--a full size is way too filling especially with the soup! Baked Potato Soup: delightfully chunky and melt in your mouth consistency. Has a slight tang to it and is not too salty. Be warned--it's super filling! Sparkling Cranberry Cooler: a bit on sour side but refreshing nonetheless. Not as ""sparkling"" as I though it would be--low carbonation.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle

Service was a bit slow but not the servers (I can't recall her name) fault. From what we could see, there was a bartender and two servers on the floor. Our server did as good a job as possible with the amount of tables she had.  Not sure staffing short was intended though as it was mid afternoon and we came right at the beginning of a ""rush"" our server was polite and best of all, did not hold us hostage with the check.  We felt bad for her even though she never once complained about how busy she was. She handled it like a pro and seemed to enjoy her job.

B N.,"Seattle, United States",0,34,2,1.0,13/6/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen has no business charging premium prices for their food. This is a Cheesecake Factory style Highschool Prom night date restaurant. That being said, I digress... After the friendly hostess seated us. I noticed the restaurant was maybe one third full of customers and they had 3-4 servers so I figured we'd get decent service. I was wrong. For some reason, the server we had seemed relatively attentive and friendly when she first came to take our drink order but then everything went downhill from there. For some reason my drink (and water) took a bit of time to arrive, but that wasn't really a big deal and the server even apologized for the wait. The first problem was when I asked for red paper flakes with my pizza and I never got it. By the time the server arrived to check on us(something she did maybe 1-2 times during our meal and was mostly ignoring us) I was almost done with my pizza and since we were trying to catch a movie I just put down my credit card and didn't mention the missing red pepper flakes. We did ask for a box for my wife's very undercooked and overpriced gluten free pizza; figuring we'd cook it more later at home. We thought about sending her pizza back, but we didn't want to miss our movie.  Well, we never got the box and on top of that the server had charged me for someone else's pizza and I had to flag down the friendly and helpful hostess to get our box and get our bill fixed. After our bill was mostly fixed we received a very halfhearted apology from our server and $50 later; we left.  Yeah that's right. 2 very small gluten free pizzas, no appetizers, a coke ($3.50) and a moscow mule(10 bucks) All of this was more than 50 dollars... Seattle isn't known for their pizza, but there are plenty of places that offer cheaper and higher quality gluten free pizza and have better service.

Clearly understaffed, we watched 2 servers (and 2 trainees..) Sprint around the restaurant, trying to give sufficient service.  We ordered drinks and salads and Richard was friendly and attentive, but clearly brief due to being stretched to thin. Our drinks came out perfect and we enjoyed them thoroughly. The girl with the two trainees was near, so we asked her for water and she said she would deliver them soon. She then within earshot said 'sometimes guests who aren't yours will bug you for things and you have deal with it'. Not exactly a comment appreciated by the ones who asked it. The AGM with a branded coat hardly noticed any of the customer service faux paus occurring around him.   Our food came out and it was consistently good on the way CPK is, which was great and appreciated.

Came here with a friend a couple of weekends ago and thought that I would have the usual CPK experience, but unfortunately, I was agitated for most of the time. What's crazy is that the place wasn't even packed and busy so I don't understand the breakdown. We our drinks came out quickly of course, then we ordered our food. As I was finishing my drink the waiter asked us after a long period of time, if we wanted some bread and dipping oil. We accepted, but didn't see the bread until, I kid you not, seconds before our food came out. So it was kinda like, what was the point of that? When the waiter put the bread on the table, he also put two WET plates in front of us then walked away. We couldn't believe it. I had to call him back and ask him to give us dry plates for our stale and hard bread. Once the food came out, I was already ready to leave. I had the jambalaya fettuccine. It was ok but I felt that they overdid the blackened aspect of the meat and the noodle to meat ratio was off.

Ally-Marie B.,"Kirkland, United States",801,275,238,3.0,25/1/2015,"The service and food I recieved was phenomenal; worth four stars, but when I was sitting at the bar on a busy Friday afternoon, I had a chance to observe how they run the kitchen and their staff.....not five stars.  There were probably 30 or so guests sitting in the dining area and only two servers and a manager-looking type woman....who didn't do much of anything even though she was frantically running around.  My Food: Starter- the guacamole  ($3.99) The portion was small for the hoard of chips that accompanied it. But it was very tasty. Up the portion and I would eat it for lunch everyday. Entree: half of the Asian Chicken Salad ($9.99) very good, I loved the crunch it had and the peanut sauce. Maybe a bit on the salty side, but I ate it all; I was hungry.  Monica was my server, but she was in a rush to assist her dining room guests so I was mostly assisted by the manager on duty.  Every time Monica asked the manager for help with an easy task, the manager would either attempt it and fail, or ignore her request all together. Even the hostess was able to dart to the kitchen and run some food!!!!!  At one point, the manager was ringing a to go order with the guest standing right there, and had some issue with the cash register! Wouldn't you know it, even though she was slammed, Monica stepped in and finished the transaction.  I also noticed that the hot pizzas were sitting out, waiting to be delivered for too long. No one was to blame as the two servers were trying to tackle the near impossible.  It's employees like Monica that really keep a restaurant in businesss. If her pace had slowed in the least, it would have resulted in angry customers and cold food. Even though she didn't order or deliver my food (the manager did), she was still very kind and checked in with me enough for me to tip her handsomely and give her an honest compliment on her work ethic.  Contrastingly, it's people like this manager that can drag a business down. More servers should be hired on the weekend so the employees don't experience burnout and the guests are happily fulfilled. Also, the manager should know how to do almost every task to better support the employees....just in case it gets busy (like today). Running food, taking orders, making drinks and correctly ringing to-go orders.

Chad K.,"Mountlake Terrace, United States",0,4,,4.0,11/11/2015,"It's hard for me to decide how many stars to give. My most recent visit went from hugely disappointing to remarkable in the span of 10 minutes. Let me explain. I get the Thai chicken pizza nearly every time, and nearly every time it's great. Except once. After placing my order and waxing effusive to my friend about how incredible the Thai chicken pizzas are, the waiter dropped off a dry, sad looking, flat, flimsy pie absent of adequate sauce or toppings. My reaction was mildly visceral. I took one bite. To be fair, it tasted marginally better than it looked. But it was not nearly as good as I remembered. A 3 out of 10 at best. Now I hardly ever send food back. Let's just say I'm paranoid about disgruntled kitchen crews adding foreign ""toppings"" to my order. But today, a CPK District Manager happened to be making the rounds, asking how everyone's food was. When she approached our table, I told her my dish was ""OK, but it used to be really good in the past."" She apologized and said: ""Let me take care of that for you,"" and whisked the sorry thing away. About 10 minutes later she returned, apologizing again for the wait. And what she placed in front of me was nothing short of legendary. The crust was perfect. The sauce was perfect. The toppings were piled comically high. It looked almost too good to eat. But I ate it. And it was the one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Now she didn't say so, but I think the DM made my pizza that day. But whoever made it got it right.

India R.,"Fort Worth, United States",20,12,1,1.0,17/2/2016,I am from Texas and I love California Pizza Kitchen. I have been traveling for 9 months and a lot up the state's I was in didn't have one.  I'm also very financially challenged so I can't afford it right now. But I heard about their reward program and that you get a free small plate. I drove 20 miles of course in the rain to get my sausage flat bread which is usually sooo delicious.  But not today.  Today I waited20 to 25 minutes for a ice cold flat bread with maybe3 sausage on it.  I know what the normal flat bread tastes like so when I'm back in Texas and making money again I will be back. But I would not be back to this one if I lived here.  Grant it was free but as someone who 20 years ago waited tables ALL the food should come out of the kitchen the same free or $500 a plate.   I'm feeling bummed for not get a sausage flat bread fix,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=40

ALL YOU TASTED was chili peppers & Garlic. No flavor n hardly any sauce whatsoever!! The tequila chicken pasta was okay. NOT ANYWHERE as tasty as it normally is but it was not awful.

Moffitt has gone great lengths to raise standards in regards to service, store presentation, and general guest satisfaction. Always taking good care of regulars, he gives first time guests the same hospitable treatment. If you're near a CPK, give it a shot.

I was pleasantly surprised at the menu -- pizza (duh), pastas of all kinds, fresh salads, and a variety of appetizers including egg rolls, tuscan hummus, and crab cakes.  Although several of the cheesy pastas being inhaled around me were calling my name, I went with my gut and chose the Waldorf Salad, which is my favorite kind of salad -- sweet dressing, with nuts, apples, grapes, crumbled cheese, and chicken.   This salad was exactly what I needed, because as the weather gets colder, I seem to eat take-out much more than I should!  :)  Our wonderful, lovely server in the bar recommended the ""Regular"" portion ($2 less) because the large was evidently HUUUGE, and my ""regular"" size was more than enough to fill me up! Kim got the hummus (too garlic-y and tangy for my taste) with warm, soft delicious pita triangles, of which I ate many.   All in all, it ended one of my favorite kind of days -- a great meal and productive shopping trip!  And the ONLY thing I bought for myself was a wallet and this salad, huzzah!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=80

Party of 2. - 9:51p Waitress #1 immediately appears announcing the kitchen was closing and we needed to order, I order drinks but ask for at least a minute to decide - 9:53p Waiter #2 delivers wrong drink order, but takes entre order, promising to get correct drunk order. We order 2 full pizzas and a salad. They never did correct the drink order. - No bread brought to the table (forgot about this until their national Web page asked if the free bread was brought as it should be). - 10:05p waitress #1 brings salad and pizzas together, announcing that restaurant is closing.  I get it:  everyone wants to go home.  you don't really want us here... despite the fact you seated us. But salads are traditionally appetizers and brought before the meal. thanks for trying to speed us along by bringing it all at once, but... never mind. Sent back the salad since it wasn't brought first. - 10:10p busboy begins bussing table next to us, bringing his fully loaded tray of used dishes while the couple next to us WERE STILL EATING. I get ready to yell at busboy if he should do the same to me. Busboy appears to notice the look on my face and goes back inside. - 10:12p Waitress #1, to her credit does ask if the *food* is okay. - No further checks on us; waitress #1 and Waiter #2 ignore us, despite cashing out couple sitting next to us. I have to call waitress #1 as she walks past us to ask her for refills on our empty glasses. - Waitress #1 lets me know they have ""dumped all the lemonade because they're closed"" (!?) so no refills are available. I asked for the general manager... who appeared offended that I bothered him and was complaining.  His only response was that they close at 10 and, the restaurant was now closed. Oh... but he took the $2 lemonade off the bill. We packed up the food and left by 10:20p.  Sorry I kept them late. Not going back.

Mine however has always been up to par. I've never had any service issues or food issues. I've been many many times and found the wait staff to be pleasant and accommodating. There are occasions when things get busy and it might take them a bit longer to get back to you but they are normally on point and they aren't bothersome.  I've had the entire variety of spring rolls which are my faves as far as appetizers go, my husband normally get's the Chipotle pizza whereas I'm more diverse. I have sampled numerous items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The salads are delish and large in portions...event the half salads are decent sizes and filling. The Chinese chicken salad is so good! They also have a new entree featuring the cedar plank salmon with corn succotash and I thought it was to die for. Personally it had the right amount of spice, it was cooked perfectly, and the fish was just delicious. I couldn't stop talking about it after I left. $18 for that dish and I thought it was worth it.  I also like the fact that they have a separate booklet that helps you compare nutrition facts and calories for those who are dieting. Because I don't get the pizza, I can say I haven't had any issues with greasiness or oily foods. Everything seems so fresh and tastes good. For such a large menu I commend that cooking brigade for getting all those dishes out. Keep up the good work and keep it clean!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=80

Their pizzas are good, I've had mushroom and enjoyed it. I like that they do half-size wine pours. The server we had last time went out of his way to greet us and make us feel welcome, and I had a very friendly server the last time. Note: You can get $5 off if you sign up for their e-club.

We where with a large group then (about 8 ppl) and we left happy, so my coworkers decided to come to the one here in Northgate for my birthday and another girls   Bday and there was about 9 or so of us. In Bellevue CPK my friend got a free bday dessert, but not here at Northgate. The waiter was super busy and it was hard to get a min with him, 2 girls tried to tell him about the bdays in the group but no luck, he walked off to quickly. We ordered the Moroccan chicken salad (one of my favs) as well as another salad and two pizzas. The food was good but being that was familiar with Moroccan salad I noticed it was missing two main ingredients: squash and beets. When we brought it to the waiters attention he said he would check on it, turns out the restaurant was out of both items. He removed the salad from our bill and gave us a second salad of the one we ordered at no charge but it didn't come out until it was time to leave (we told the waiter we only had one hour and we where there for lunch) he boxed it for us. We asked the waiter for water for some of late arrivers but it never came. We also asked for more silver wear and it never came (she ended up eating her salad with a salad spoon). We realized 10 min into the meal we needed another pizza but we couldn't get it order because the waiter didn't come by in time to put the order in. The ice teas never where refilled and I left hungry. We let the manger know and he apologized but honestly it shouldn't get to that point when you go out to eat.

Maria Y.,"Seattle, United States",64,262,72,4.0,24/6/2012,"Yes, this place is a chain. But I worked at the mall for about a year and a half, and if I wanted to get food after work at someplace a bit nicer than the food court or Chipotle, this was one of the better options. I would not recommend it for PIZZA pizza (tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni, GREASE) but they do have a lot of interesting specialty pizzas. The menu is quite large and diverse. It does kind of have that overall blandness that I've come to associate with chain restaurants -- while everything I've tried is good, nothing was particularly exciting or unexpected. Actually, that's not true -- they have pizzas with salad ON THEM. That's pretty unusual, unless it's a California thing; I wouldn't know. I haven't tried one because they just sound weird. The personal pizza is usually a bit too big for me to eat in one sitting, but leftovers are nice. It's worth getting a box for your leftovers instead of stuffing yourself here, because they have good desserts. Key Lime Piiiieeeee.... The drinks are also good. I love love love their dessert coffee drink Almond Joy, which includes amaretto, coconut rum and chocolate syrup. Yummmm. Here's the thing that always bothers me about this place, though. They have a very strange service policy, that apparently is enforced by corporate, that I don't like. Servers all introduce themselves in their flat, scripted way (""Hi! I'm John and I'll be serving you tonight! Can I tell you about our specials?"") and every time I've eaten there, the manager on duty has come around at least once during the meal and asked us how we are doing. This might seem like a nice touch, but it feels very corporate-enforced. I've had two separate managers do this, a man and a woman, and both of them seemed almost suspicious of their servers. ""Is everything okay? Reeeally?"" It was a weird attitude to have, because we were doing just fine, and it made me feel like there was something weird going on except that this seems to happen every time (I've asked some co-workers if they had that happen too, and they all did.) So, Corporate, if you're reading this, STOP MAKING THEM DO IT! It's really annoying and weird.

The service is good, and the food is good. Yes, they are somewhat overpriced. Which is probably part of the reason I don't go here that often.  BUT, they have good pizza. And in the end, that is all that really matters. I LOVE their honey wheat crust. It is especially good with the chicken club pizza, which has bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and lettuce and mayo. It sounds weird, but is actually delicious! I am also a huge fan of their thin crust Sicilian pizza. Oddly enough, their signature bbq chicken pizza isn't that great.  I think the only bad experience I ever had here is that I ordered an iced tea, and I took a drink and it tasted awful. So I told my waitress that it tasted funny, she instead brought me a diet coke, and in a few minutes came back to let me know that it turns out someone had accidentally made iced coffee instead of iced tea. The fact that she looked into it, and fixed the problem was really awesome.

On to the service... Just as we opened our menus (less than 1 min after sitting down) our waitress came by and asked what we wanted.  I assumed she hadn't seen us just sit down and was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She came back about 2 min later to ask again when we were clearly having a conversation about what to eat.   Throughout the remainder of the meal, she was less intrusive, but it seems the company had mandated a 10 minute minimum between table visits.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=60

Their BBQ chicken pizza is definitely the best they have to offer, which is just plain mediocre. Steer clear from their pastas - they are not cooked or seasoned well, and other dishes. (I haven't had their salads or soups though) However, what is really appalling is their service. The staff are as unorganized as you can get. I didn't even know who my server was (since 5 different people had to interface with me to get a pizza.. uh?). Expect awkward delays in getting refills, getting your check, etc. The staff are constantly chatting each other up rather than doing business.

Dauphine S.,"Vancouver, United States",1,29,,2.0,6/6/2014,"I haven't been to a CPK in years, but I had time to kill to avoid traffic. I was not feeling great, so I just wanted something reliable.  Good: The mushroom pizza was very good when adding the truffle oil. If I ordered it again, I would add arugula.  The managers buzzing around were very friendly and on top of things. Surprisingly good beer selection, but you have to ask about what's on tap.  Most of the staff I encountered was very friendly.  Free wifi is always a bonus.  Meh:  The uniforms are so dated. The headsets that all servers and managers wear are really cheesy, bordering on annoying. No, not bordering on - they are really annoying. No real reason why, jmho.  Bad: My server said I had poor taste because I like mushrooms and truffles. I get it was joking around, but inappropriate.  The interior of the restaurant is incredibly dated, to the point of being uncomfortable. It felt like a Denny's with all the low booths and bad design. I'm not an interior decorator, so I can't put my finger on it, other than do say it could use refreshing.  The truffle oil is very expensive and tasted like a 'fake' truffle oil. It was so strong that I assume it was enhanced with synthetic scent/flavor.  With 5 tables or so in the entire place, I fell victim to mediocre distracted service. Two basic requests were forgotten (water and condiments).  Only the manager knew what was in a basic bar drink that was ordered. The first thing a bartender should learn are things like a Collins, a press, a sour, a spritzer... No happy hour.  I'm not one that frequents chains like this, but didn't know the area and needed something reliable and easy to navigate.  I remember visiting early CPKs years and years ago when they first opened in SoCal, and I was happy to see that the pizza quality was still as good as remembered, again, understanding what it is. But, because of the interior and flip server, I do not plan on returning the next time I have time to kill in that area.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=60

They recently changed their pizza dough, that no longer has high fructose corn syrup (Thank you!!) and it tastes much better than it did before. The crust is more 'fluffy' and has more flavor. I used to not eat crusts, but this crust is delicious even without any toppings. The Garlic Chicken Pizza was amazing. I'm hoping that this will become a regular menu item. The service was fantastic as well. Our waitress was really friendly, quick with the refills, and was overall was happy to be there.

And they really did their homework. They are certified GF and take every precaution. It's wonderful. They have also perfected their pizza crust recipe so that they have a thin, crispy crust that you can't even tell is Gluten Free! They cook the pizza in a separate place with a separate person and a manager delivers it to your table. No cross contamination. And it tastes great! My favorite is the BBQ Chicken.  They don't have any other GF entrees, but some of the salads and things are safe. I'm so glad I have a reason to come back to CPK!

Cathy M.,"Mill Creek, United States",80,145,2,3.0,19/4/2013,"I find it a little awkward when I go to California Pizza Kitchen when I'm not in California anymore. I never gave it a second thought but now when I read the menu, I imagine a blonde surfer dude advertising the healthy and fresh California-style of food you came to this restaurant for! My favorites at this restaurant remain the thai crunch salad, which I resorted to after they took away the miso seafood salad. I still mourn the loss of that salad. I'm adventurous with pizzas, but I like the pear and gorgonzola or the thai chicken. I'm pretty sure there used to be a peking duck that was great but not on the menu anymore. That's another thing I'm disappointed about of CPK. I've been going here since my childhood because it's one of the few non-asian restaurants my chinese food eating mom liked. I've seen their menu change a lot in recent years and much of what I grew to love is gone. It's sad. I have a feeling their consolidating their menu to get rid of ingredients that were only used in certain entrees and thus weren't price effective to keep in the kitchen. Having crab just for one salad or duck just for one pizza probably isn't smart.  CPK isn't a very expensive restaurant, and their pizzas seem to have gotten bigger even though the price hasn't changed much.

Our waitress was gone for, pretty much the entire time. We needed refills on drinks, more napkins for the kids, and there was no one to ask because we were stuck in this little corner the entire time.

The interior is minimalistic, but the booths are comfortable and a few TVs at the bar offer the promise of distraction. As an appetizer, we chose the chips and guacamole dip. They have an interesting concoction by using corn in their dip. Surprisingly, this works fairly well with the chips and was a pleasant discovery.  For the main course, I went with the Buffalo chicken. This was well done with just enough spice to be entertaining compounded by celery and ranch dressing.

While their frozen sicilian pizza is in my opinion the only frozen pizza worth buying, the frozen version of their thai pizza is just gross in comparison to the one you get in the restaurant. I've never had a problem with the service at the Northgate location but then again it's a CPK it's not like I'm expecting the world. :) The waiter was friendly and personable, though I did have on nit to pick. My fiancee ordered the wedge salad, I ordered the half roasted vegetable salad and we ordered the Thai pizza. For some reason only his salad came before the pizza despite the fact that I was the one who actually put in the pizza order. Fortunately the pizza was screaming hot so I wasn't forced to deciding between hot pizza and my salad. One thing I love about CPK is their salads. They definitely aren't really for those people watching their diets, a full size salad with chicken will usually clock in at about 1000 calories but they are super delicious. I think their salads, and more specifically the avocado, would be the reason that their prices are high for what they offer. In Washington I've only been to the Bellevue, Tukwila, and Northgate locations but they without fail always have perfectly ripe, bright green avocado and it doesn't taste like it was soaked in preservatives or lime. They must throw out 2 avocados for every 1 that they use or else they have some kind of food science sorcery that lets them preserve the avocado without making it taste like they did. If you work near a CPK and don't mind the prices they offer great to-go service. You have the choice to order online or by phone and either walk-in or at some locations they have car-side service where they just bring it out to your car. When I went to pick up my food from the Tukwila location they always offered me a drink while I waited if I showed up before the specified time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=100

I have no idea why, but I never have ordered their pizza in house. It has been either take out, or the frozen ones at the store! Hahahah! Ok so today the fiance wanted to treat me out to lunch. We both ordered the BBQ chopped chicken salad. Our favorite. Since I have been cutting out certain things from my diet, I ordered it without the tortilla strips, and no avocado, with balsamic dressing on the side. The waitress was very accommodating, not flinching once.  We also got an order of the Singapore Rolls, (again due to my cutting back). The salad was terrific. We both found that it didn't need the dressing and was good the way it was. Mine came with a lime wedge so I happily squeezed away. Mine came with avocado, but oh well, I love it and thought it was a nice treat. The lunch portion was just about the right size, I ate a bit more than half and boxed the rest. The Singapore Shrimp Rolls were just a glorified Goi Cuon (Vietnamese salad rolls), though the noodles were tossed in a dressing, and it had different veggies. The slaw that came with it was pretty tasty. We liked it ok. Not as good as mine, but it is good to see people's interpretation of things. LOL! My fiance also thoroughly enjoyed his Coconut Mojito. I had a few sips, and like I said it was a nice strong drink. The staff were all friendly and nice. I'd rather go here than Azteca's, Stanford's, and Macaroni Grill.

Durrrr....so we had to improvise. A bevvy of appetizers it would be! We shared the Spinach Artichoke Dip, the BBQ Chicken salad, and got a cup of soup each.  The dip was served with tortilla chips. In my humble opinion, spinach dip goes better with pita bread or crackers, but it was cheesy and hot and yummy. The salad was a little low on lettuce but pretty good, especially because it had little tortilla strips on top for crunch. (Apparently they like using chips in their dishes!) I had the split pea soup, which was nothing like my Mama's but definitely edible.  Grand total was $40 before tip, which seems a bit much for how little we got.

There is some sort of promotion going on right now at CPKs that involve a thank you card that can only be opened on your next visit (to reveal some variable prize, I presume). We were pleasant. We did not complain, and in fact embarrassingly raved about the salad. But for some reason, Josh, our waiter, thought us unfit for a thank you card, when the booths on either side of us received them. Tsk, tsk, Josh. You should never let a guest feel unequal to other guests.  Now that THAT is out of my system. YUM: any assortment of pizzas (Jamaican Jerk, Thai chicken, Wild Mushroom, many others) BOMB: their salads! I would eat salads ALWAYS if I could make them like this at home (with minimal effort, of course). Highly recommended: Miso Seafood (you can get it down-charged to chicken instead) and Thai Crunch. Why revel in a chain restaurant when there are many wonderful small or local pizza joints, you ask? Well, when I want something filling, and not food coma-inducing, this is the sort of thing I go for (either this or a bun salad at a Vietnamese joint, depending on my mood): consistently non-greasy dough, and a variety of filling and tasty salads.

It wasn't really that busy or over crowded and the noise level was definitely low.  Good service.  The pizzas were kind of pricey for $15+ per personal pizza but definitely a treat!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=160

Andrew F.,"Seattle, United States",11,21,,1.0,31/5/2016,"Wow!  What a strange and horrible experience! I've been a long-time CPK fan -- particularly when traveling for business, when you want to go somewhere that is going to have quickly served at least pretty good food that isn't going to get you a call from the accountant after you submit your expense report.  CPK has been that place for me (kudos to the Oak Brook, Illinois location, where I've spent many a dinner after a day at a local client site). So, I know what to expect, as do my wife and kids.  But, noooooo.  Not this time.  While the food was most definitely sub-par (the mac and cheese, which is usually good, was flavorless and the salmon salad was pretty much inedible), we going to talk about something else today.  What might that be?  Why, our waiter, of course. In short, I'm really not even sure how to explain what went wrong.  I actually found myself mentally trying to put the story together prior to asking for the manager to come by, and I found that nothing I could say would really do justice to the situation. He took our drink order.  No drinks appeared.  After quite a while, we nicely asked for our drinks.  He asked what we ordered.  Told him again.  No drinks.  But he spent an inordinate amount of time at the terminal, flipping through his pad and punching things into the computer. He brings bread to the table, which is immediately consumed by hungry family. Still no drinks. Finally came by to take our food order.  That took a while. Goes directly to another table to take their order, rather than punching our order into the computer.  He's there for a loooong time. One drink appears! We ask for the rest of the drinks.  He asks what we ordered. We ask for more bread. YAY!  The kids' meals appear!  Nope.  They're kids meals, but not for our kids.  He takes them away and sort of starts offering them to the occupants of his various tables.  They appeared to eventually find a home in front of some children a few tables away. Still no food.  And one drink.  We ask for drinks again.  Waiter asks what kind of tea my wife had ordered, which we took as a good sign that he at least remembered she ordered tea. Drinks appear! We see waiter sort of aimless walking around with a plate of bread.  Eventually he diverts to our table.  Yes!  Bread!  Three pieces for four people. Waited a while longer, and the food appears.  See above note about quality of the food). I think we must have had ""a look"" on our faces, because one of the other waitstaff was walking by and stopped.  She wanted to know if everything was OK.  No, she wasn't the manager.  I could only incoherently mumble something about ""bad"" due to no clear manner of explaining the dystopian dining situation in which we'd found ourselves. We ate what we could that was sort of edible.  Shared our plates to ensure that nobody left too hungry -- you know, like a pack of leopards around a fallen gazelle.  Somebody else was clearing our table, when our waiter appears. . . with a caesar salad.  No, we didn't order it.  He looks confused.  Or crestfallen.  Or crestfused.  Whatever.  We had't ordered it. He finally asks if we want refills on our drinks. The manager comped the entire meal.  We didn't even have to ask her to do so or ask her to come to the table.  At some point she just figured out what was going on.  Sort of like when you pass an accident and see everybody standing by their cars on the side of the highway.  I think that's pretty much what she saw going on at our table.

Ambiance: Sparse, dimly lit and clean, the streamlined space is perfect for a casual date, a spontaneous family dinner, and a casual go-to for an impromptu dinner out while shopping. What I ordered: The ending to our Veteran's Day of eating out, I opted for a simple Asparagus and Arugula Salad ($5.95) tossed in housemate lemon vinaigrette with sun-dried tomatoes, toasted almonds and shaved parmesan.

We shared a sangria flight special they had.  There were a few things wrong with our visit. Where to start... We wanted to sit outside and asked if they would turn on the outdoor heater. It was a little brisk out but still a beautiful day. One waiter said sure but they only turn them on in the evenings so she'd have to get someone to turn it on. Once we were seated, another waiter said they aren't working so great right now, so they won't turn it on. Okay... I waited 15 minutes for the bread basket, and when I realized after 3 times the waitress stopped by that it wasn't coming, I asked if they still offer it. She said yes and brought it out a few minutes later. My pasta dish was ok, not great but not bad. I'd give that 3 stars.  The sangria flight was interesting to try, although nothing I would order again. His soup was ok, a little salty and bland though. The sandwich was good, but about 3 bites in he felt a sharp piece of plastic in it. We let the waiter know and she had the sandwich remade, but not to our specifications to accommodate food allergies.  When we asked for the check, she happily told us she didn't charge us for the second sandwich/soup combo - the one we had to send back because they made it wrong. But she still charged us for the first one - the one that we sent back because it had bits of plastic in it. Why would we pay for either of them?? We asked her to please remove the charge for the sandwich, not the soup which he ate, and explained why. She did that, but we're baffled as to why we had to ask.

Alexander H.,"Seattle, United States",0,13,,3.0,14/1/2017,"This restaurant serves very hearty and rich foods. Every bite is dripping with some butter or cheese. Basically, not a place to go if one is being mindful of some sort of body transforming New Year's resolution. However, with that being said, this review is for a ""Rich and Hearty Pizza"" restaurant. I had ordered the Rib Eye steak and the jambalaya. This place is not a great place to get a good steak, but they'll charge steak house rates. (Price of the steak was $27.99) The meat was tough and lacked flavor. I ordered the steak done medium well and there was ""rare"" blood pooling on the curls of the steak. I suppose the brick of cheese set on top of the steak was intended to mask the low quality of the cut, but it really didn't help. I was basically eating cheesy rib eye steak. Now onto the Jambalaya, the dish wasn't too bad. Every bite was an explosion of flavor down down to the last bit. Some may enjoy this sort of flavoring, but I just felt it was over powering the good ingredients. The Jambalaya had shrimp, crawfish, sausage, and a tasty pasta. I couldn't finish the dish, but the first few bites were very delicious.

We are taken to our table and not even seated yet when our servers pops over and asks if we'd like anything to drink, I'm caught a little off guard, I'd like to take my coat off first and sit down before I'm asked such a tough question as what would you like to drink.  We send her off to find water for us and finally sit down. The menu pretty much looks the same as it did 9 years ago with a few changes.  Since my morning was stressful I decided a cocktail was in order, I went with a raspberry mojito.  It took forever to arrive and I kind of wish it didn't it was more like a raspberry sugar water with mint in it no bueno. Now on to the food.  We started with the Tuscan hummus which was actually rather tasty.  They make theirs with white beans and it had a nice hint of garlic and lemon nothing was too over powering and the warm pizza pita bread they served with it was yummy, however I could have done with out the fresh tomatoes served on top they were a bit to watery for me. I decided on a half Chinese chicken salad and it was drenched in dressing and not in a good way either.  The lettuce, carrots and cilantro that weren't drenched did seem to be pretty fresh and tasty.  If I ever order it again I'd over dressing on the side, I did enjoy the dressing but sometimes too much of a good thing is bad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140

Topped with oregano and basil. That was one of my favorites before I gave up pork and beef. I still love and eat the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza with its caramelized pears, Gorgonzola, Fontina, and Mozzarella cheeses, caramelized onions, chopped hazelnuts and served with field greens tossed in herb ranch dressing. Have Mercy, CPK! 4. CPK also serves soda pop as well as beer and pretty decent drinks.   We've been there at least ten times (day or night) so far and our experience  has always been great across the board. I will continue  going to CPK.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
MrsKimch I.,"Seattle, United States",21,180,18,3.0,24/5/2006,"Look, here's the thing-the pizza is good, if a little bit odd and/or bizarre at times (ie the duck pizza, weird but good).  This is such a California thing to do, (believe me, I lived in the bay area) but honestly, you really can put just about anything on a pizza and call it ""good"".  Now the unfortunate part...the service.  Our server had a 3 table section and still couldn't manage to even come over once to check on us, and our pizza took like, 3 milleniums to come out. I almost ate the table while I waited and I had to ask for every refill and the complimentary bread.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Geoff N.,"Seattle, United States",77,106,17,3.0,26/10/2006,"Today I went to CPK for lunch for the first time in years. The restaurant used to be a standard dining location for me when I was living in L.A., especially since several of my friends worked there at the time. Being that it had been a while, I decided to order my old standard. My friends and I shared the spinach dip as an appetizer and I had the chicken Caesar focaccia sandwich with tortilla soup. The food was more or less as I remember it. The spinach dip is gooey, rather than chunky, which makes it easier for dipping. Since going to CPK last, I have become accustomed to a homemade spinach artichoke dip that has much more substance to it. Still, the CPK variety is tasty, though we ran out of dip before we ran out of chips, which is kind of annoying. The sandwich didn't seem to be as Caesar-y as it used to be. In fact, it seemed more like a standard chicken sandwich with romaine lettuce. If I order something called a chicken Caesar sandwich, I would hope for a little more dressing, anchovies or a knife in the back or something. The tortilla soup also seems to have evolved. In my opinion, it now contains entirely too much corn. A little bit is okay, but this was like corn chowder. I dislike corn when it's not on the cob. It especially bothers me in soup for the same reason the tapioca balls in bubble tea bug me. Simply put, it makes me feel like I am eating boogers or an equally revolting, chewy substance of approximately nostril size. The soup was tasty apart from the corn and being at CPK brought back memories of college. The price may have gone up a couple bucks since my last visit, but not really enough for me to notice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Jill S.,"Seattle, United States",15,187,,3.0,14/5/2011,"My real rating is 3.5 stars. CPK is consistent and I've never had a bad meal. Unfortunately, their service is consistent too--consistently average. I'm not sure if it's a bad work environment, but I've been there many times (10 or more) and both the servers and the hosts always seem preoccupied and just a little grumpy about being at work. The food is good, so if you're looking to just eat and not necessarily have a pleasant experience, then CPK will fit the bill. I agree with some of the other reviews that it's a little pricey for what you get--but the wide variety of pizza choices is nice, as well as pasta dishes and salads.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Sabra S.,"Seattle, United States",22,3,,5.0,15/4/2011,This place is waaaaay more than 3 stars. I used to work in the area and definitely took this place for granted when I did. Love this place!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Jason L.,"Seattle, United States",9,113,1,4.0,17/6/2012,i can always count on their pizza and salad.  the service is good and food comes out pretty fast.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Andrew H.,"Seattle, United States",30,57,2,3.0,3/2/2011,"A little pricier than it was worth, but the waiter was nice despite appearing completely terrified of making a mistake.  Also seemed a bit rushed to turn over tables.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Tiffany S.,"Seattle, United States",185,487,13,3.0,13/7/2007,"A very solid 3. Had dinner here tonight after a mall shopping spree (Macy's is having a big sale on cute clothes). Neither of us was super hungry, but we were celebrating Friday and Chris' purchase of an IPhone (2 weeks of waiting wore him down).  Like Mitzie, I ordered the Raspberry Mojito (I swear I hadn't read her review yet), and I thought it was not-so sucky. The first one kinda kicked me on my ass but then again I hadn't eaten since lunch.  I ordered the half cobb with Fat-free Vinaigrette on the side. Chris had the Thai Fettucine. My salad was good, though I thought the beets were a little overwhelming (and I like beets). We both thought Chris' pasta was good, slightly spicy, and the fettucine was cooked perfectly. Chris had a Cabernet and our total bill was $45 something (oh yeah, I had another raspberry mojito - HELLO, it's Friday!). I wish we went there more often because the food is solid. Next time we'll probably grab a pizza. I LOVE their honey wheat crust!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Michael L.,"King, United States",9,58,,2.0,13/5/2010,Very generic pizza and appetizers. The service was great though. The waiter was on top of her game....so generic there isn't a whole lot I can say to be specific.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
Kathryn H.,"Kirkland, United States",1,53,,5.0,8/3/2012,"I'm very impressed.  It's been quite awhile since I've been to a restaurant where the entire staff actually cares about being there and as importantly, cares that the customer is there.  Gavin was our waiter and he was excellent.  His appearance was professional, had a genuine smile, and knew his menu.  He was without a doubt a 10.  My friend arrived first and she was greeted promptly and then I arrived and was also greeted within a couple of minutes.  He wasn't pushy and checked on us at perfect times throughout our meal.  The manager, don't know her name, blond and very personable, was on the floor and really cared about the customers needs.   The staff seemed to be very cohesive.  As for the food, we split a bbq chicken salad and Gavin split it without us even having to ask.  It was decicious and was served on well-chilled plates..so delicious.  We also shared a pizza, which was very tasty, it was a new one, can't remember the name, but could have used more cheese for my taste.  I liked their wine by the glass selection.  Not the ususal boring Kendall Jackson and Chateau Ste Michelle.  Ordered key lime pie for dessert, which was very good and a fresh cup of coffee.  This place is in a Mall and so I wasn't expecting much.  They have their act together. Final note:  We arrived in the late afternoon and stayed for a few hours, talking business.  We were not once rushed.  We will be back! THANK YOU!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140
