James R.,"Auburn, MA",217,121,70,3.0,3/21/2010,"Hit Chili's in Reading, MA before checking out 'Alice in Wonderland' at the Reading IMAX.  Ya know...I don't think Johnny Depp is typecast into these ""unique"" roles:   Sweeney Todd, Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, The Mad Hatter I think he must be like that in real life, so it comes easy.   Directors are probably like: ""Ok Johnny...you know the drill...act like you're a metrosexual on crack...again."" Oh right...Chili's. Chili's is one of those places that I could always take or leave.  I've been there my share of times...and never really walk outta there amazed. But Chili's has survived the test of several years...and they never seem to be hurtin' for patrons.  I am sure that the full bar helps... I had the Chicken Crispers...which amount to boneless chicken wings...but these are a bit unique and have always been a go-to meal when I come here. Our waiter pointed out the new menu...which did include some new dishes...but kept most of their meals from what I could see.  I tried something new, however, Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers... These were actually really good, sweet with just a hint of spicy...and comes with enough of its own sauce that you don't need the ranch sauce that comes with it.  This meal also includes skin-on fries and corn on the cob.  Not fresh corn on the cob like you would get in season...it's the jank cob, like you would get at KFC's.  Well...this might be a click or two better than the KFC excuse for corn of the cob I spose.  Normally...skin-on fries I am a big fan of.  Five Guys does them well...Chili's does not.  All three members in my dining party didn't eat these.  Ketchup and salt don't even save them. This could have been a two star...as definitely...meh, I've had better.  But since I do like the chicken crispers...and somehow find myself eating/drinking at this place on an irregular basis, I will round up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",165,1240,162,4.0,9/17/2006,"The hostess looked extremely unhappy to be there but Christine, our waitress, was very nice/upbeat. We were seated quickly even though we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. The lack of vegetarian options means I always end up ordering a black bean burger. Although, it is great that there are so many black bean options.  The waitress was very attentive and made sure we were happy. I felt slightly sick after eating so many french fries but that was my own fault. I love how reasonable the prices are and recommend stopping by Jordan's for the water show after your meal. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Amy D.,"Brighton, MA",58,37,25,4.0,5/29/2012,"I have a weakness for Chili's to begin with, so I expect to always have a strong opinion about my visits to these places either way. This Chili's in Reading has a busy bar scene, but that may be because the only 2 times I've been there have been close to Xmas so there are more people out anyway.  The female bartender who is there I think mon-thu is excellent. She handles the regulars like a seasoned bartender, and some of them need it. They all love her though. Her service is great and friendly. The first time i went in we joked about being the only women in the bar. I ordered a beer, and she suggested a different beer that was on special, which I appreciated (although I didn't take her up on the suggestion). Actually, the second time I went in, the bar was packed and she remembered me right away, and I was actually glad to see her!   The food comes out quickly and as ordered ( I am unfortunately the kind of a-hole customer who never just orders anything as it is on the menu).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Julia F.,"Somerville, MA",297,840,193,2.0,7/18/2010,"Chili's.... I'm really not a huge fan. This location seems to be the local watering hole, which is cool - but doesn't at all endear it to me. I hate that there is never parking (literally everybody who goes to the bar MUST drive individual cars there...) and the food is really only so-so. There isn't much to say. We have the same waitress, sometimes, they are sometimes funny, sometimes easy going, don't really seem to remember individuals (unless you grew up with them) but remember loud obnoxious groups of people who drank $2 drafts all night long. But, hey, man, we tip well.  In my opinion the food is not worth the price they ask, and the service isn't good enough to gain this location a place on the list of ""places to wet your whistle when up 93"" and so... I will go there when my friends are there, and will avoid it at all costs otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Christine T.,"Boston, MA",13,223,363,2.0,4/25/2011,"bleh.  went here with Mom on a Saturday afternoon so we expected a crowd and for service to be slower than normal, but it was at a snails pace. We ordered nachos for our app, with most toppings on the side and what we got was laughable (see pic) - you call that a plate of nachos? just pathetic. The meals were okay, but not enough for us to go back.  overall completely underwhelmed by this chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Jphubs J.,"Wakefield, MA",5,21,96,2.0,4/30/2011,Two stars might be pushing it.  I'd personally rate the food as just okay to not worth your $$. You feel nasty after eating there. Greasy city. Maybe it's the all-you-can-eat chips and salsa they fill you up on? They have bad margaritas which always taste like 100% sour mix. Dissapointing. But I do like their burger sliders and the beers on tap. This place is just meh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
john p.,"Reading, MA",5,76,,2.0,3/28/2014,"Ate at Chili's. The corn on the cob was not bad, it was horrible. Over all experience was not so good due to loud offensive music.

Bonnie G.,"Wakefield, MA",0,13,,2.0,1/19/2015,"Normally I love Chili's but last night myself and two friend met at Chili's in Reading. Our server was very forceful and mildly-rude. My friend, who just a baby, ordered the guacamole burger and when it came the guacamole was full of jalapenos, which made it way too spicy to eat and far too spicy to pass on to a baby. After much debate, in not wanting the complain we found the first server we saw and asked if we could send back the burger, the server was more than willing to do this. I'm glad for this. However, then our server came out and said, ""too spicy, what do you mean too spicy?"" Which again, was fairly intense. We explained and she left. Then at the end of the meal, with half a burger and nearly all my fires on my plate she started to take my food away. Until I looked at her, then she asked if I needed a to go box. What happen to asking if I was done or if I wanted dessert, we clearly still chatting. Then she came back again reached across my face and my plate to my friends plate and took it EVEN though my I was mid-bite of a fry. While were at our table longer than the normal meal time the place was empty. There were people at the bar but the restaurant side was empty. It was mid-day Sunday between 3 and 4. What was the rush?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Patrick C.,"Lynn, MA",5,34,5,5.0,9/3/2013,No wait to sit.  Waiter was on top of his game.  Decent food for such a small price.  Loved the queso dip and tostados.  Burger was cooked to liking and meat fell of the ribs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Liz A.,"Saugus, MA",16,71,21,4.0,7/17/2011,Ran in for a quick lunch while I was waiting for my car next door. Staff was friendly and the lunch special was cheep and good. I had soup and Sandwich.

Journey M.,"Boston, MA",1,28,,3.0,5/28/2009,"So it's Chili's, which is fine.  It is consistent in atmosphere and menu choice which is good.  Right down the road from Jordan's, which is helpful when you are planning to eat at Fudrucker's and they are closed (nice going, we weren't the only ones looking for a burger).  My only complaint was the service. While the waitress and hostess were very nice and cheerful the service was SLOW! We waited almost a half hour for them to notice us and take our order...not good when you are traveling with little people.  The food was fine standard, certainly edible and well portioned.  So if nothing else it is a safe, predictable place to go...but don't be in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40

Ellen W.,"Wakefield, MA",13,92,,2.0,7/1/2008,"I went here for my friend's birthday this past Saturday for the first time. First we were seated in the front corner window at a table big enough for only two (there were four of us total). It smelt like a dirty diaper, no joke. We all noticed this and were pretty much disgusted so we then requested to be sat at another table near us that looked more capable. From the look on her face, the waitress pretty much thought we were being ridiculous until we explained that three of us were ordering burritos and that alone would take up much of the table. My food was great, and so was everyone else's. However, the waitress bent over to pick something up off the table and poured water from her pitcher onto my purse, jacket, and lap. I was soaked. She apologized but I wasn't feeling it. Had it been some other liquid, or if my phone had been in my purse...the shit would have hit the fan. Bathroom was nasty. Hostesses need some finishing school.

Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",108,494,38,2.0,8/9/2007,"After a late night trip to Home Depot which shares the parking lot with Chili's, my hubby and I stopped in for a quick dinner. It was a random Wednesday night at 9pm, so there was mostly an adult crowd with a couple tables of teeny boppers too young to appreciate authentic Chili mixers. We walked in and the front teenage hostesses were confused and arguing about table numbers and where to put my party of 2. Really, these little girls are just wasting customers' time and their haggling should have been done outside. I had the bottomless blackberry ice tea (yum) and the regular nachos. The nachos were 10 separate chips with separate toppings, not the pile up mess of toppings and chips you would find at everyday-faux-texmex. It was ordinary as expected. They ran out of the awesome blossom. Stupid. The only saving grace was the several refills of ice tea I garnered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Ken M.,"Allston, MA",111,426,2,4.0,4/26/2008,"The minus 1 star is for slow service.  The food is fine, the atmosphere of this new location is pretty good, and it's cheap.  Three stars of this review are devoted solely to the Southwest Eggrolls of which I am addicted.

Christine S.,"Reading, MA",4,105,,2.0,8/26/2009,"Ok go here for a drink. Just one or two though or you'll pay more than you should. This place is really hit or miss. Way too much salt in just about everything. You get charged for chips so don't think Mexican, its called 'grill and bar' as it was explained to me.  Good items, the chicken sandwich is pretty tasty and maybe the jalapeno poppers. Not impressed with much else and a family of 4 with two children wont get out of there for under 80.00 unless you stick to kids menu, no dessert and avoid ordering margaritas. On a good note, most of the staff is great. The manager is very friendly and thinks of the community. One or two of the younger bartenders should take some service lessons (yes that means stop flirting and get new customers orders, it means more money honey) though the manager seemed to step in and pick up the slack.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Dale N.,"Wilmington, MA",85,236,93,3.0,1/4/2008,"Chili's has a place in my heart for having great margaritas and the most addictive chips you'll ever have.  That's all I come here for, in fact.  It's a nice place to get happy. The rest of the food is kind of blah.  They won't let you order your burger anything but well done, which is a pet peeve of mine.  Almost all other restaurants print that little disclaimer and let me slowly kill myself with undercooked meet, but not Chili's.  The fried food always tastes like the oil needs to be cleaned, not at all appetizing. Trust me, stick to the margaritas and chips and you'll be a happy camper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40
Stephanie C.,"Somerville, MA",2,25,,4.0,6/1/2010,"I LOVE this Chili's.  When my husband and I come and want to be really gross, we split a bunch of appetizers: the kickin' jack nachos, southwestern eggrolls and skillet queso, followed by the baby back ribs. We always get the skillet queso actually. He loves the chicken tacos and I just had the fajitas for the first time and they were really good. I always get the presidente margarita too.

Unauthentic mid level American fare disguised as ""South Western."" This place caters to people who lack taste bud due to their affection for cigarettes and booze.

Dessert , the molten lava cake is in my top 5 for desserts.  Chips and salsa are ok, generic at best.

Derek J.,"Woodstock, Canada",28,1,4,4.0,12/27/2016,I've never had Chilis before but it looked like a standard chain and since we were pressed for time we decided to pop in for lunch.  We started with the fried asparagus without any jalapeños because my wife and I don't really like spicy food. It was okay but it didn't stand out. I thought there would be a little more flavor.  We also had the Texas fries! These were awesome! Lots of bacon and melted cheese. I would recommend this for an app over the fried asparagus.  My wife had the guacamole burger. It was unevenly cooked. Half the burger was medium rare and half was medium well. That said she still ate the whole thing. One note about the presentation: don't put a small/ medium sized burger on a large plate. The scaling throws off the presentation and makes it seem smaller than it actually is.  I had the ribs! I thought they were solid! The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was just spicy enough. I really enjoyed them. Our server Kim was really friendly and she kept our drinks full!  A few adjustments but overall a positive experience! We will return for lunch!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2
Janelle G.,"Stoneham, MA",352,192,55,2.0,2/8/2017,This place is hit or miss. My meals haven't been too great the last couple of times. I got an appetizer sampler and the original chicken tenders.

Little known tip- if you tell your server that you ""like and respect"" the restaurant (exact words), not only will your meal be comped, but you will sometimes be led through a back passageway behind the bar to a place I like to  call ""Secret Chili's"", where the queso AND guac is bottomless with your obligatory table chips.

For beer they offer a dozen beers in 16 or 22 Oz glasses,  only two local beers - - this really is a Bud or Coors light kinda place.  On this visit I chose their new soft tacos. You can choose a combination,  in my case I chose Pork,  Shrimp,  and Tilapia.  The shrimp and pork are sure bets. Also the Pico de Gallo (fresh salsa) is what made these Tacos.  As for negatives the fish was a bit watery.  Also the accompanying rice was undercooked and dry with no seasoning.   The black beans were alright and had some spice. Beer is cheap,  3.29 for 22oz makes it the cheapest bar in the area.   But it does close early and I have heard from others that they do a 2-3 drink max as corporate policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2

A few moments later, either some neurons experienced connectivity in the hostess's brain or she overheard me mention to my aunt that perhaps someone may notice that although we had 5 in our party, 3 of them have ages that encompass a single digit and all weigh under 80 pounds so maybe they could live dangerously and try to fit us into a table for 4.

I told her medium rare, and hubby likes his medium. They both came out like hockey pucks!  More on the medium well/well side.  Barely edible at best. Come on, why is it that so many restaurants have trouble cooking a burger, other than well done?  We will never go back and will pass on to anyone asking our recommendation not to get burgers there.  On a side note, next to us was a young couple with their toddler sitting in a high chair.

I want there last night.  I have not been there in years.  Let me tell you, I have not missed much.  I spend almost 30 dollars for food and drinks just on myself.  That would have been fine in most situations.  But when the steak with avocado is only a six oz steak, avocado is extra, the nachos only have like 10 on the plate with cheese, and you get 2 shorties with a beer selection that is small and not that great, you've spend of few dollars more than you should have.  Maybe the fajita's are still good, but the price and quality is rather disappointing. I don't know what to say only that there are so many other good bar and grills around.  This place used to be at the top of the list, but not anymore.  Thank god this place has a good location or it probably would be out of business compared to some of the other places around.  Three stars is ok overall, but when you consider places like Buffalo Wild Wings with their big screens and Yard House with their beer selection, who really cares about Chili's?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20

My hotel was in the next town over, and I was hungry. Having been to most of the places around that area, I was in the mood for something different. Looked up this place on Google, and even used their website to place my order.  Ordered the 6oz sirloin, medium well, with an order of shrimp, side of mushrooms and loaded mashed potatoes. Usually comes to $20 or so. The site said it'd be ready in about 15-20 minutes, more than enough time to drive over there. It was ready by the time I got there. The girl at the station was bubbly and polite, which was nice. The food itself was decent. The steak was still juicy and I just love shrimp...they weren't overcooked!  Would probably stop in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
Nancy D.,"Wakefield, MA",134,28,1,4.0,8/1/2013,"My husband doesn't like chain restaurants, but Chili's is okay with him. I think he likes the tall beers and margaritas. But enough about him. I usually come in for lunch, although I have had more than a few diners here too . The lunch specials are great and the food is better than average. The servers are attentive and helpful when it comes to ingredients and how things are prepared. One time I wanted to try the cookie in a skillet dessert but asked if I could get it crispy instead of chewy and was informed that since they microwave the cookie, there is really no way to make it crispy. I said that was fine, but a minute later, the server was back to say they were going to try it in the oven. Well, she was back a few minutes later to tell me that it hadn't gone well, so they were going to just prepare one the usual way, which turned out to be fine. I did appreciate everyone trying to get me something the way I requested it, and had to laugh at the updates. I also enjoy the Presidente Margarita and enjoy watching the servers shake-shake-shake my margarita (extra points for panache!). My favorites are the Quesadilla Explosion Salad and the chicken tortilla soup. The burgers are decent but stay away from the chicken strips and many of the fried things as they come out super greasy. Oh, I almost forgot my most favorite thing - the Southwest Eggrolls are awesome! Sure, maybe a little greasy, but they are served with a lovely ranch-y dipping sauce and heartburn be damned, they are yummy! Glasses for water and soda are large so you don't have to pester your server for refills very often, but refills are free. What else to say? I guess that I have dined at quite a few Chili's and found them to be pretty generic. The extra star for this review is for the staff at the Reading location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
Jennifer T.,"Lynn, MA",1,8,,1.0,10/24/2014,"I have eaten at a Chili's before,so I new what to expect,  however, this time the food and drink REALLY was under par.  I ordered chicken fajitas there was about 1\3 of a single green pepper on the skilllet , and that was all for the veggies.  The picture on the menu showed an abundance of green and red peppers, onions and meat; mine however was just sad.  My boyfriend ordered a margarita, and it was ALL sweet and sour mix- nothing else, it was disgusting, we actually sent it back and I never do that.  The only positive about the visit was our waitress was friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
Alison D.,"Wakefield, MA",121,213,12,5.0,10/9/2012,"Fast, easy, good.  I'm talking about lunch, so get your mind out of the gutter!  I'm not creative when dining here, I always get the lunch combo which comes with bottomless everything, although, if you take advantage YOU will not be bottomless.  I get the cesar salad, soup and chips.  I have rarely gotten seconds on any of it, even when pregnant, so the portions aren't skimpy.  Great, speedy lunch place, and they don't rush you if you don't want to be speedy.  I know it's a chain, but I still like it here!  Super cheap beer too, even though I have partaken due to my noon arrivals.

Bridget W.,"Boston, MA",5,60,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Stopped in at the Reading Chili's for a ""quick"" dinner after a Home Depot run.  We have visited the Wilmington location several times and always have a good experience.  Not so at Reading and we will NOT be going back to this one.  We only ordered entrees and water but it took nearly 90 minutes to get in and out of there.  The server finally showed up after about 25 minutes after we ordered to explain that ""the kitchen screwed up"" by making one of our meals with chicken rather than the requested steak, so they were starting that meal over again.  Then another 15 minutes later he came by to say he had talked with his manager and they were going to take that meal off the bill because it was taking so long.  Fine.  But when the food finally came, both meals were room temperature, not even warm, and the entree that was topped with steak (a very meager portion) also had 2 chunks of chicken.  Clearly they had just stripped off the chicken .... most of it anyway ... and let it sit while waiting for the steak to cook.  The other meal wasn't even under a heat lamp, which is not ideal anyway.  We then had trouble flagging down the waiter for drink refills, although the place was nearly empty so no idea what he was doing. The floor throughout the dining room was filthy.  They did comp the meal as they said, but between the bad service, disappointing food and lack of cleanliness we will take our business elsewhere in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
Dan L.,"ROXBURY CROSSING, MA",0,31,10,1.0,6/8/2015,"Poorest quality Chili's I've ever been to in my life. Having been to another Chili's just two weeks ago in different location, you can clearly see that this one in Reading is seriously ruining the dining experience for the restaurant chain. They skimped on the portions of both the appetizers and main dishes. Everything tasted disgusting and metallic, most of the food was barely cooked. I even ordered the same exact meal as I normally get at Chili's and it was less than half the amount of food. Steak in the fajitas came out bloody raw and had to be sent back. Completely unsatisfied with my experience here and felt sick after eating the food...almost makes me want to never go to a Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
Aleta A.,"East Sandwich, MA",0,1,,1.0,8/2/2015,"Third time at a Chillies, used to be a favorite of ours. So disappointed again. Won't be going back. Caribbean Salad was awful.

TL L.,"Somerville, MA",0,15,,2.0,7/20/2014,"I was in last night and the 2 hostesses were amazing.  But the service was sub par.  I go out a lot.  Last night I had some kids with me.  I think that any good server would automatically bring extra napkins.  I shouldn't have to ask for them.   Then the server came back asking the infamous ""are you still working on that?""  While I am eating a piece of corn on the cob.  Seriously,  that's a question for right now?  Yes, I think we're still working. Then another server came over and started to clear the table while the rest of my party was in the restroom.  Again, I'm still eating.  I realize being a server you don't need a degree in rocket science, however, common sense might be useful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20

Having been in the area for a business thing, I was looking for a place to eat and since the offerings are limited to my hotel (no way) and some other chains, I tried this one as it had the most cars in the lot... Got a spot right away at the bar and the bartender was right on the money with the service.  They were having some sort of team trivia thing so I helped the 3 guys next to me and we had a good laugh -  The food is standard Chili's offerings so don't expect much. The really nice thing, and this may be at every Chili's but not sure, is that after 9pm there is another happy hour complete with cheap appetizers - so you can totally chow down on the calories then go right to bed...

Jonathan Y.,"Stoneham, MA",1,45,2,2.0,11/9/2011,"I went here about two weeks ago with my girlfriend and our two friends.  Now I've been to this Chilis numerous times as I just live in the next town over and it's always been good with courteous service.  This time things were different. Our server was next to awful.  She brought my girlfriend a salad with shrimp instead of chicken like she asked.  The plate was presented as a mistake in the kitchen and we were asked if the shrimp was ok or if it should be replaced.  Not being too picky and not trying be a bother my girlfriend took the shrimp.   Then when we ordered another round of drinks (3 beers) we all asked for 12oz drafts.  I ended up getting a 16oz from the waitress because she said they ran out of small glasses. I took it and figured I'd still get charged for a 12oz. Nope! Needless to say when the bill came I was charged for that 16oz beer when I asked for a 12oz and my girlfriend was charged for shrimp and not chicken.  I've worked in restaurants and I know how things work when taking orders.  This girl plain messed up, tried to blame it on somebody else, then passed the monetary mistakes onto us so we'd have a higher bill.  Not right in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20
K C.,"Wilmington, MA",0,3,,1.0,5/21/2015,"I'd give it 0 stars if possible. The health department should shut them down. The food was not edible. Would rather eat at a McDonalds. The staff was beyond rude. A piece of chicken wasn't even cooked and when I showed it to the waitress she grabbed it out of my hand and walked away with it. The ""chef"" and I use that term very loosely came over and tried to tell me it was just a piece of dark meat. I know what dark meat looks like and it was raw chicken. There's a reason he's a ""chef"" at Chilis. Not only was it not cooked but it wasn't even the correct order. The kids meal I ordered was supposed to be original and the adult size portion was supposed to be crispy and they mixed them up. Just glad I saw it before the child I was with ate it or they would be sick right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20

Chili's is a great place to meet a group of friends to eat mediocre chain restaurant food and drink a couple beers. All the while in the company of everyone you went to high school with.  Good times. Also, they now hold the door for you on the way in and on the way out. I thought the host was hitting on me, but he did it for everyone.
