24,Kareena S.,"Miami, FL",203,75,295.0,2.0,2013-05-27,Wasn't impressed by the food at this location. Service was kind of slow but the server was attentive. I ordered the 2 for 20 deal. And got the chipotle chicken flatbread which was good. And for the meal I got the sirloin with loaded mashpotatoes and broccoli. The steak was a bit over done and the loaded mash potatoes was cold and looked very stale. I didn't touch one bite of it. The broccoli didnt also taste fresh. It was a bit cold like maybe it was microwave. This is why I gave this chilis 2 stars.

I'm older and have a lot of experience but once in a blue moon, there is the right time to speak up about service. We were told a 25 minute wait, which was fine, after all, it was Friday night.  We had a group of eight. We waited over an hour just to get seated. It felt like we had been forgotten.  After we ordered, it was another 50 minutes. The first food they brought was totally someone else's order. It was 9 pm by the time we had been served. We ordered sandwiches an one appetizer. That food was alright. Two of us had the Buffalo salad. The chicken was so soggy and cold, we asked for new salads which was another 25 minutes. Served chips with no salsa, you have to buy that. The staff was friendly but they were so slow! The whole experience was so disappointing, it makes me not want to ever go to Chilis again. I had  zero expectations going in but after we left, I was left with such a bad impression of the whole establishment. The atmosphere was nice but that can't make up for the rest.

40,Rachel K.,"Naples, FL",93,85,66.0,2.0,2015-10-14,"I haven't been to a Chili's in years, and my visit to this one reminded me why. My entire family decided to have lunch there this past Sunday. There were 8 of us. We started with a couple rounds of happy hour 2 for 1 drinks. The Bloody Mary's were fabulous! Next up, appetizers ... Chips and salsa, DELICIOUS southwestern eggrolls, and the best darn fried pickles I've ever tasted. Then, our meals came ... *BARF!*. 3 of us ordered steak and chicken fajitas. The chicken wasn't fresh--it looked like a sliced McDonald's chicken patty. You could literally SEE its rubbery consistency. The steak was ... weird--I don't know how to describe it. (We were pretty disappointed, since Chili's is known for it's fajitas.) My mother-in-law ordered a turkey burger; they prepared her a beef burger. My sister-in-law ordered a sirloin, which was lacking juiciness and looked like it'd been previously frozen. After a couple bites, she gave up and decided to eat her broccoli instead, but it was undercooked and crunchy. She ended up sending her entire meal back for a refund. I give credit to the service, though. The manager personally came out to fix all of our problems, and immediately offered to take my mother-in-law's burger off our tab. The waitress was also good at keeping our drinks filled, and bringing anything we needed in a timely manner. I don't think I'll be going back to this, or any, Chili's unless it's for drinks and appetizers--and even THAT'S not enough to make me choose Chili's over somewhere else.

There's a reason why it has the star level it does, and what's more apparent is management isn't doing anything about it. Let me begin with the fact I sat at the bar and was greeted by an obnoxious bartender who made it a point to be sarcastic, TRY to be funny, complained about customers and cursed the entire time I was trying to eat. Oh yea and bring your sweater it's a warm 60* in the restaurant . As I was waiting for my food, an interesting incident occurred in which another waiter asked the bartender ""Hey where's the mucinex?"" (Did I hear that right?!) he grabs a bottle of liquid mucinex off the bar and takes it to the kitchen in the back. WHAT valid reason would there be for ANYONE handling or preparing food to need that? If they are sick, GO HOME! Not a minute later my food arrived, my only consolation being that the mucinex waiter did not handle or prepare my food.  I ordered the tacos, 3 different kinds. To say they were overly salted is an understatement. ALL of them.  I had to wash down every bite with water. What's more, the rice was undercooked and hard. When my waitress Jessica (who was actually wonderful) asked me how my meal was I told her the truth, it was horrible. She asked why I didn't say anything sooner and I told her because I'm not one to complain after getting my food, especially if I can't see it being made. She brought the manager over and the manager wanted to comp my meal but I refused. I wanted my complaint to be valid and not look like I was trying to score a free meal. I also made her aware of the mucinex incident. She also asked why I didn't say anything about the overly salted food and I told her I didn't want to risk someone spitting in it or worse. Her words were ""I guarantee you none of my employees would do that, but I understand"".  I paid for my lunch and gave a 20% tip to my waitress Jessica. NOT A MINUTE LATER after talking to the manager, another waitress walks up to the bar saying a customer complained there was something floating in her drink. Bartender replies it's just a seed. Waitress: ok, but she wants a new one she doesn't agree it's a seed. Bartender reaches into glass and removes seed. Waitresses response: Ok let me stand here a minute so she thinks we're making a new one. YUP that's it! None of your employees would spit in my food if I complained, but they would certainly get drugged up on mucinex and reach their fingers in your glass.

He said he found the rest of my order sitting on the counter after I left and he I could return to the restaurant and get it! I told him to just credit me for one-half the bill, plus take off the $4.00 tip I left. He said, ""I can do that."" Well, he didn't, so I called my credit card company to have half the total charge reversed.   This restaurant has always been well below par for food, and certainly, service. While I was picking up my order, another To-Go customer couldn't get lids for his three drinks because the restaurant had ""run out"" of cup lids! Sean offered no apology or ""comp"" to the customer, just the reason. The customer had to take the drinks to his car first, then return for his food.

Expect your food to be extremely oily, wrong, salty, and gross. There was 4 of us and we waited an hour for the food, it wasn't busy, and one of the orders was wrong. We asked to just have the toppings that weren't on it to be brought out and waited 20 minutes, no one ever came over, and decided to just eat it without them. The wrong drinks were brought out, and when we asked for the ones we wanted the girl came back with them, didn't very apologize and gave a dirty look.  It's also pretty dirty and cold inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

On Cinco de mayo every restaurant in town was jam packed, so we decided to go to chili's because it's usually a safe bet. The restaurant wasn't crazy busy but you could tell they were short on waitresses. After a very VERY long wait we ordered drinks. An hour later (no exaggerating) the waitress came back to take our food order. An hour after our food still hasn't arrived at the table. Growing frustrated we called on the manager. She told us she'd take something off of our bill! We didn't come here for hand outs we came for a good meal and good company. By the time our food arrived we were full on chips. Our waitress was snippy saying she's doing all that she can. The restaurant is freezing. All in all, HORRIBLE experience and needs new management.

14,John M.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,21,20.0,1.0,2016-05-26,Don't even know why I've come to this location more than once because the service has remained horrible every time. I typically sit in the bar area and the service is the slowest out of any place I've ever been.  It usually takes about 10 minutes just for someone to come to our table.  It's never even that busy so I assume  it's laziness on the part of the servers or incompetence on the part of the managers for not knowing how slow it is.   I only come here because it's close to my home and every time I visit it's a reaffirmation that the service is still as bad as the last time. Also it's ALWAYS FREEZING in the bar area.  Seriously even the bartender complained to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

37,Grace S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",59,33,1.0,1.0,2016-09-23,"I will not come back to this particular chain. The service was awful. It was mid day (not even peak lunchtime), and all I did was order a burger to go. I waited WELL over 30 minutes and even then I had to ask what was taking so long because all the other staff completely ignored me in the 'to go' area even though they were NOT busy. The bartender was on his iPhone most of the time. No apologies when the food came and then the burger was overcooked. I'm done with this place, at least this location. I would have gone back and complained to the manager but I was on a time schedule and had to keep going.

17,Anthony M.,"Sandy, UT",8,87,,2.0,2016-10-03,"We love Chili's as a chain, and we usually have a really good experience. However, since the location out on 951 is so slow, we decided to go to the Tarpon Bay location. Service here was slightly better, though the waitress still left us with empty drinks for long periods of time. The food was good, as usual, so that is nice. But the payment method...which is done by hokey touch-screen devices always covered with other people's greasy fingerprints (um, yay?)...is so weird. Also, after I paid, I was typing a comment about the slow service into the touchpad, when suddenly the waitress appeared and actually grabbed the device out of my hand. She pretended (badly) to be concerned about whether or not the device accepted my payment (the receipt was laying right there on the table) while I watched her remove my comment and exit out before I could send it. Then she carried the device away. Chili's, the key to receiving a good review is to provide good food and service at a good price, not snatch the touchpad from a customer and delete a comment.

8,Quentin S.,"Kansas City, MO",172,42,56.0,2.0,2016-10-22,"How can one mess up a Chili's experience? I fancied it nearly impossible considering that it's a chain! Same food, same menu, same everything as the thousands of other locations across the US.  I ordered carryout and everything appeared to be fine. My order was accurate. Food was hot, service was decent considering I was merely ordering it to go. However, my five-star experience was immediately reduced to two-stars when I got back to my hotel and realized I didn't have any silverware! How could someone forget something as fundamental as silverware in a carry-out order?! To say I was livid is an understatement. So by the time I obtained utensils my meal was cold. $25 pissed down the drain cause of a pattern (based on the other reviews) of forgetfulness and oversight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

We cleaned the table ourselves. Service was fine after that, but server was a little busy.  Food was good, cheese enchiladas were tasty and hot. Free chips and salsa are always good. Two for one beers are always good too. Newer location and and kinda cookie cutter restaurant, typical boring just like all the rest. Good prices.

11,Alexus C.,"Naples, FL",25,1,,1.0,2017-09-24,"Walked in and wasn't even really greeted by the ""hostess"" if that's what she was. She just kind of rudely asked us how many were in our party than without saying anything grabbed menus and started walking away very fast. We got a good table a nice booth and we're happy with the iPad and the games we could play, it was a nice touch considering we ordered our apps as soon as we sat down and didn't get them for at least a half hour later, the ""hostess"" is the one that brought us our apps and without a word just kind of dropped it at our table. We never got any appetizer plates so we kinda just awkwardly ate over the small plate the nachos were placed on. My boyfriend was not ever even given a fork in his little ""sack of silverware and straw"" thing. So we had to share. We ordered entrees which showed up about 5 minutes after the appetizer we waited forever for from the same hostess who did not even ask who's plate was whose, we had to tell her and she silently plopped down our food again and walked away with no words said. Our drinks were not refilled once and or waiter came to the table only once to first apologize that it was taking so long and than when we were almost finished with our meal he showed up again to ask how everything was going and if he could get us anything else- we had already paid. We just asked for a box. I understand that it may have been busy although it was not, but I have had better greetings walking into a Taco Bell than I did today at chilis. The short brunette with the two braids standing at the front with her sour face let me know my experience wouldn't be that great from the beginning. Guess I should've left then. Thank god for the games on the table or me and my boyfriend would've been two very hangry people while we waited. The only reason I tipped is because I understand that is how waiters make a living and regardless of service that man needs to eat too. Just step it up chilis.
