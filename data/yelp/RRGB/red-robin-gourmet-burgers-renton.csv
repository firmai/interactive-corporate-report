Dign G.,"Seattle, WA",132,28,232,3.0,11/23/2017,"SUMMARY: good reasonably priced  food. Decent service. Long wait time. Would come back and recommend to others.  Service: Came in and waited to be seated for about 15-20 mins despite there only being 1 group of 9 people, ahead of me.  When I was seated it took a while for them to actually take my order. The employees were very nice though when they were  paying attention. Everyone was always serving with a smile. The manager came by tables later on asking how everyone was doing. It was very welcoming and redeemed the customer service aspect for me.  Food: My boyfriend ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger and I got the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double -- ""The big ghost"". This just meant that instead of a double patty burger, they were going to put one big patty instead. My burger was very tasty and the jalapenos didn't feel soggy. Nice to know it was fresh. I didnt try my boyfriend's burger because I was so focused on my own and all the flavors lol. The fries were also good. None were soggy or too greasy so we definitely got more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
S H.,"Portland, OR",56,97,2,1.0,12/12/2017,"I like Red Robins, but I HATE this particular Red Robins.  Usually Red Robins the staff is nice, friendly, smiley, and seems to hustle and be quick with their table service.  Unfortunately, I dont experience even one of these things both times I've visited, and this was both before and after their re-model.  I usually order take out from this location and every time am disappointed.  Yesterday I come to pick up my order and an Uber is sitting in the space for 2go orders so I had to snag the only space left available - a handicap space. I park here and the uber guy starts trying to hit on me which makes me uncomfortable, if y'all patrolled your parking area maybe your customers wouldnt be getting harassed by pervs...  Anyways, I walk in behind a Kitchen Staff who holds the doors open for customers who are exiting, but then looks at me and lets the door go. I'm a half second behind this fat mofo and he does it again in their second entry way of the foyer. Ok... things are off to a fantastic start right?  Then I go up to the hostess and ask about 2go orders, and she points me at the red counter just to my right. I stand there, and shes still standing there at her podium, and does not assist me. In fact, no one assisted me for about 5 whole minutes. Waitresses and bussers walking by, the hostess still looking bored at her podium, and what appears to be a Manager overseeing it all, not jumping in to help. Awesome manager skillz. Finally some guy comes up, hes friendly and he gets my order info but then a call comes in. He ends up taking this phone call for about 4+ minutes, while NO ONE comes in to go get the food. Again, manager is just standing there at the front of the house, girl at the podium still standing there, but nope, everyone's too busy to fetch the food. Finally the call ends and he moseys to the back and comes back with my order.  I walk out back to my car where the uber driver is still there waiting for me to return. He continues to harass me and yell thru his window.  GREAT EXPERIENCE!! Woo hoo! I will not be doing a 2go order anytime in the future, not with this Red Robin location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Lisa R.,"Renton, WA",0,25,14,2.0,10/23/2017,"I came into this Red Robin when I first moved into the Reserve apartments and hadn't unpacked the kitchen yet. The service was okay, however, the food was not. I ordered a burger (they're supposed to be known for the burgers apparently) and the size of the patty I got was definitely NOT 1/3 lbs. I ordered it medium rare with what I verbalized was a ""pink, warm center"" and the burger came out flattened and well done. I tried to eat it because I don't like returning food, but here's the worst part.  The bartender saw the burger and commented, ""Oooooh, that looks a little more well than you wanted it..."" and I confirmed that yes, it was more well done than I had asked for. She just said, ""Sorry about that..."" and walked away. Didn't ask me if I wanted another one, and didn't remove it from my bill. Needless to say that's the last time I have been in.  The visit was on 5/14/2017 and I just found the receipt in my drawer reminding me to leave this review.  There are much better options within a single mile radius, I wouldn't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Vanna P.,"Renton, WA",52,102,231,1.0,12/26/2017,Ordered online and said no tomatoes in my burger. Guess what I bit into when I was eating. A tomato!! Yuck. And they over peppered my egg....I had to wipe most of it off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Kimberly M.,"Seattle, WA",86,5,1,1.0,12/23/2017,"To start our waitress spilled a glass of water all over one of us, then ran from our table crying. It took 10 minuets for someone to bring towels to clean it up. No offer of a free drink and she barely got an apology. But clearly the waitress was upset over it. The fries were cold and appetizers came with the meals. No manager seemed to be on site or even care what was taking place in the dinning area. If you like Red Robin I would skip this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Camille Y.,"Seattle, WA",58,318,107,2.0,10/29/2017,"It pains me to write this review, because I like Red Robin for their service and friendliness. However, for the past two times we called in an order for pick up, the fries were old and the one of our orders was completely wrong! Horrible, because one of our friends is allergic to cheese and they gave us a burger with cheese on it. The fries were so old they tasted horrible. It certainly was not worth our gas to drive back down to get a refund at RR. Suffice it to say, any order pick ups should be double checked and the customer should be given the same quality of food as if they were to dine in! There's a saying, ""They always screw you in the drive through"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Sha G.,"Renton, WA",10,58,44,2.0,8/30/2017,Sub par. Too many options to choose from. For a 10 dollar burger you want big and succulent.

Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,983,177,3.0,2/16/2017,"We come here because it has vegetarian options for hubby and sometimes, while we love 5 Guys...we really just want a sit down restaurant.  The Landing has a few restaurants and we've been to most of them.  The standout stuff here (for me) are not the burgers, but I've had some servers here that are so slow it's taken 30 minutes for food to come out...and I've also had my order wrong. If I were less lazy and tired, I'd haul my butt down the other Red Robin out in Tukwila, but sometimes I really want something close to home that isn't fast food. I love Red Robin's shakes and malts. No whip, no cherry...chocolate or vanilla shake or chocolate or vanilla malts with EXTRAAAAAAAA MAAAALLLT!!!! There's a reason why we're not here every week day or week...and it's the shakes/malts. The long and short of it is I've found this RR, in general, to be one of the worst out of all the RRs I've been to (the first is the one at Rivermark in San Jose, CA, with a manager who called me and seemed so disinterested in what I had to say about poor service I received)...and as a total heifer who has eaten at all the RRs in CA, WA and OR (ok, totally ashamed to admit that, but I need to establish my credibility when I make statements like the one in the sentence before!), I don't like saying that because I'm a total RR fan since the early 90s. Great, now I'm showing my friggin age. Anyway, we come here because it's one of the few sit down restaurants that's open late near us. It's not like we come here 2-3 times a week, but we do come here once a month to throw in a little variety in our dining out options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Everett B.,"Seattle, WA",166,161,449,3.0,12/6/2016,"Another Landing staple, freshly renewed after coming down with a bad case of fire. We never aim to go here but sometimes get pulled in by the smell, which I do not think is coincidence. Its OK, but there are limited options at The Landing and sometimes you just need a burger that's not quite as greasy as 5 Guys. The long and short of it:  1. Sandwiches. I don't say burgers because I rarely get a burger here. My personal favorite is the Whisky River BBQ Chicken sandwich, it's a nice mix of flavors and a bit lighter than a burger. They offer it as a wrap as well but usually skimp on the chicken then. They offer a large array of rotating burgers that are decent, not great. It'll do for a mid-day burger craving when it comes to it. 2. Bottomless Sides. Again, I don't just say fries because the sides are variable. Yes you can do bottomless steak fries but you can also sub this out for bottomless salad, broccoli or cold slaw for no extra cost. The Broccoli lacks in taste so I'll usually spring for the salad. Then again you're here, might as well go all in on the fries. They'll give you ranch and campfire sauce (still not entirely sure what this is but its good) upon request to dip. 3. Booze. A large selection of beers and liquor is offered but I've only been here for work lunch so I've never taken advantage of this (that you know of). A nice option to have. 4. Staff. The staff here is awesome and attentive, especially for a place located so close to a large factory that fills up quickly. They've always been exceptional at keeping glasses full, fry baskets coming and people fed. 5. Price. It's pricey for Red Robin, but that's The Landing for ya. A burger and fries will run you over $10 alone. Tack on a drink or appetizer and you're looking at a bill that I wouldn't want to pay for OK food.  6. Payment. You can split bills by item and pay via table consoles which is neat and speeds things up a bit. Much appreciated for people who need to get back to work. I'm not crazy about Red Robin, but it is what it is and every once in awhile you just have to grab a burger and entirely too many fries. Just try to not get dragged in by the smell too much!

Jim B.,"Renton, WA",93,176,89,4.0,6/30/2016,"We are big Red Robin fans.  You know when I was once in the restaurant business years ago I thought of an invention to have a computer screen at the table where the customer can call the server, possibly even order drinks or food, and pay the bill.  Too bad I never had any money to launch my product.  Red Robin has executed this strategy and has even added trivia and games to it making it fun for everyone at the table. As far as the food goes, Red Robin has something for everyone with a specialization in Burgers.  They have TV's everywhere in the bar and no real bad item on the menu.  My kind of place and they do have Manny's on tap which I will maintain is worth a half star extra in my criteria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton

Rubina P.,"Renton, WA",12,104,95,3.0,10/7/2016,"Brooke was very nice and friendly. the reason I am giving a bad review is because our table was sat directly under a freezing cold fan. then  half of our food came out cold. most of us ordered the mac and cheese . it looked really good on the menu. it had breadcrumbs and all kinds of goodness on it. it comes out and they were very disappointing.  toast chunks on top, noodles with melted cheese on top. that's not mac and cheese! false advertisement. the TV had boring work our infomercials the whole time. not even sports.  thankfully brooke made up for the poor food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162,1.0,10/2/2016,"Stopped for a late dinner.  Was told there was a 15 to 20 minute wait.  Hostess came out and tried to take us  to a large table. I asked if there was a booth available. Although I saw several empty ones we were told we would have to wait.  We ended up eating another 12 minutes. Finally we were taken to dining area by hostess who stopped us in front of a dirty table. The busser started to wipe the table and ended up throwing left over food onto me. Not even so much as an apology. I asked him please not to throw the food on me. He just looked at me but said nothing. We ordered our food. Wedge salad as appetizers and Royal Red Robin burger. Waited over 20 minutes for salad and it was only after the waitress walked by and had an ah ha moment....did she remember the salad. The burgers were not that great...the lettuce wilted. Asked for more fries and was given half cooked fries luke warm. Asked the waitress to bring other batch and it looked like they just added some more cooked fries on top of the undercooked ones. I asked to speak to the manager who finally came over.  I told her about our experience from the beginning. I told her I understood it was busy and a Saturday night but the service was terrible. I told her it looks like they just added a few cooked fries on top of the undercooked ones.  She said that the 1st basket had been tossed out but the kitchen staff just mixed the 1st batch of undercooked fries with the second batch under the heat lamps and then put them in a new basket for me.  If I sent them back in the 1st place why would I want undercooked fries again? My wife mentioned that the meal in general was not good and her burger tasted strange. I pointed out that the lettuce on the burgers was extremely wilted like it was bad. She blamed it on the heat lamps saying the lettuce wilts immediately under the high heat but it was more like the lettuce was old not heated. She told my wife that she would take the burger of her bill. (We asked for separate checks to take advantage of our separate rewards offers)   The manager said the waitress was in tears over the situation.....and that she is one of the more loved waitresses there. She again said it wasn't really the waitress' fault but the kitchen staff.  The waitress came back out with my fries but didn appear to have been crying. She left the bill however and my wife pointed out that the manager said she was going to deduct the burger as she didn't eat it because of it tasting badly. My wife handed her a 20 and I gave her my credit card...before I could mention my rewards (and she didn't ask if I was a member) she was off to the races.  I told her to hold up......I needed to give her my rewards number....she grabbed a pen and took down my phone number. She didn't come back but the manager did with the credit card slip and the change for my wife.  She said again she apologized and said that the waitress was in tears (again) but hoped that we would give them another chance.  I told the manager that this didn't appear to be an isolated occurrence as she had to apologize to the table next to us for having their order mixed up and delayed getting them the right one and that it looked liked she had to be apologizing to a few other tables as well. She said they were short handed amd a bit off their game tonight.  I said that judging by the comments on yelp that this has been going on for some time.  She said she had just recently came to this location but did read some of the less than favorable reviews.   Evidently nothing has been done to correct the issues.  She again apologized and told us to have a good night. My wife looked at her bill $3.27 for the wedge salad amd counted the change.  15.75.  She at first thought she had been shorted 2 cents.  I said no she gave 75 cents back and covered the 2 pennies but actually short changed a dollar on the change back. On our way out I asked the hostess to call the manager again.  The manager came up and I handed her the bill.  I said the bill was 3.27 and this is the change you gave back. She counted it and says oh you are short five dollars.  I said no...you gave back 15.75 it should have been 16 not 15 dollars back plus the change. ""Oh.....well it's just a dollar.""  Then she blamed the waitress saying that she was so flustered that she didn't make the correct change...even though it's was the manager that brought the change and credit slip to be signed. I hope that the company didn't bring this manager in to fix this location because she is way off the mark.  She didn't say she would talk to the busser about his throwing food off the table to me, kept coming up with excuses for the waitress, blamed the kitchen staff for the problems with the fries (eventhough the waitress shoikd a have double check make sure they were all cooked enough) and then throws the waitress under the bus for the incorrect change.   She did go back to get ""just a dollar"" but we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Reba H.,"Renton, WA",245,133,419,2.0,4/10/2016,"This restaurant has some great family friendly/kid friendly features. One of which is a fun chalk board in the waiting area. Another perk is a coloring and activity sheet on the back side of the kids menu. I took notice of the new tablets they have at each table. You can order food, pay your tab, or order games for the kids to play at about 1.99 per game.  The kids menu has many choices to choose from and decently priced choices. The drinks are free to refill, so feel free to order as many chocolate milks as your child can handle. My children ordered the pepperoni pizza and mandarin oranges. They didnt seem to like the microwave pizza but could tolerate the fries. My husband and I had onion rings, a chicken ceaser wrap, and chicken club sandwich. Each dish was okay. I thought the wrap was a bit stale and not so fresh. Tbe onion rings were probably the best thing we ate there tonight. But hey its Red Robin, we enjoyed the family time at the end of the night.  I cannot forget  to rate the service. We had a very polite waitress. It was packed so service was slow, understandably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton

Kat S.,"Federal Way, WA",107,15,21,1.0,4/21/2017,"We came in on 4/21/17 around 10pm to order something to go. The lady that rang me up was not exactly friendly which I can understand at the end of a long shift but this was a bit more than that. I tried really hard to be extra nice to her but it didn't seem to help. To be clear, the girl that was working the bar and take out was working her ass off and was pleasant. The girl that rang me up to help her was not I ordered a bonsai salad that had really good chicken on it but the dressing was so mustardy that I could only have a few bites before I gave up. I should have tasted the dressing before I poured it on. The menu does not specify that the salad has a honey mustard type dressing instead of an Asian dressing which would make more sense. Again, I should have asked. They also didn't give me the garlic toast that was supposed to come with it.  My boyfriend got chicken tenders with a total of six fries with them, all of which were ice cold. The amount you pay for the amount of food you get with this is not good.  My friend got the pub mac n cheese which had no flavor to it at all and the serving size was like a side instead of a full order.  Again, for how much you pay the amount of food you receive will leave you with an, ""I obviously just wasted my money"" feeling.

Local B.,"Renton, WA",0,8,3,1.0,12/21/2016,"The Renton Landing Red Robin is the worst. We went there once with a group of 4 and they got 3 of the 4 orders incorrect along with other bad things that happened during our meal. We went there again last night with a group of 7 and it was the same experience. The floor in the place was so greasy that it was like walking on ice getting to our table. It took 15-20 minutes for a server to even come to the table.   The first order of food they brought out was not even our order and the place wasn't busy. When they did bring the correct items, 2 of the orders were incorrect.  The appetizer that was ordered was the LAST item brought to the table.   The queso dip had a LARGE chunk of hamburger patty in it.   Most everything about this experience was bad and that was twice in a row.   We will never eat at this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton
Helen S.,"Renton, WA",163,133,214,4.0,1/15/2017,"We frequent Red Robin because the four kids can be loud and they usually eat their entire meal here. The bottomless basket of fries helps too. The quality of food and menu has definitely changed with some things getting worse - like the garlic fries, and some things improving like the variety of burgers offered. I was disappointed that the milkshakes don't come with the leftovers in the metal cups anymore and they give you the exact amount. Our service has always been attentive and quick. The wait can be long during peak times but the nice thing is they'll take your cell number and you can shop around the Landing until your table is ready. The table tablet to pay with is hit or miss and sometimes works for us to order drinks and appetizers as well as pay and sometimes does not, even with the server trying to assist us with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton

My sister and I were turned away from the bar because the restaurant did not accept our Guam (US Territory) Driver's License.  First off, We were first told to go to the bar because it was busy on the family side (we are over 21 years old). Then when the server came over to check our IDs, he said they don't accept them.

Jordan N.,"Renton, WA",71,128,165,4.0,5/15/2016,"First off, I must say I was really sad when the chain took out the cheeseburger sliders from their appetizer menu. That was my go-to back then and didn't like the fact that I had to choose something else to order from that point on. Otherwise, this is the spot to go to if you want gourmet burgers for a decent price, and it has been a great addition to the Landing. I always say I'll order something new every time but I always get the Prime Chophouse because nothing else on the menu really appeals to me. I feel like I can never finish it in one sitting! This burger is unique because it has onion straws, horseradish, and even topped with a free onion ring! Their fries are pretty good also, and they're bottomless so dig in! Sadly, they don't give them to you in a basket anymore, they're trying to be fancy and give the food on a small tray and doesn't really give you a lot of fries to begin with so you might need to ask for more right when you get your food if you know you'll eat a lot of them. I've always been too full for dessert until last night, I was craving more dessert than a burger. We ordered a chocolate brownie cake topped with vanilla ice cream and a berry drizzle. I wish it was a bit more moist but still yummy nonetheless! I gotta give a shoutout to our server Brooke last night thought. She was super sweet, kept checking up on us, and reminding us that our drinks/dessert will be on their way soon. If you ever eat at the Landing location, try to make this girl your server! I don't eat at Red Robins that often anymore, I had my rewards card for years but I feel like I only eat here on my birthday or some random occasion.

I was confused and embarrassed, but stated that is what I wanted. I asked if the manager could okay it, she scoffed and walked away in a rude huff. About 3 minutes later the item was delivered, with a mean look from the waitress and not saying anything else. To top it off my drink sat empty for a while (enough time for her to come by and refill my friend's drink) and she didn't seem to care. I only go here when there are time constraints and I never expect good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=20
Angela N.,"Renton, WA",582,157,65,4.0,9/10/2015,"If you are looking for a good burger, Red Robin is a great choice. This location I am a fan of because it's close to the movie theater. So grabbing a burger and then catching a film is a great evening in my book.  Food here is like all other Red Robins out there, but I will tell you my likes/recommendations: Burgers =  - Guacamole Bacon Burger (On lettuce instead of a bun.)  *I dig a burger with Swiss cheese! - Grilled Turkey Burger  - Blue Ribbon Burger  Other sandwiches =  - BLTA Croissant *Who doesn't love avocado on their sandwich!

Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1687,441,245,4.0,12/26/2015,"This is a chain restaurant, you are going to receive cookie cutter food with cookie cutter service since it's a cooperate and servers are probably being micro-managed so I don't look for personable service, I look for consistent food, and that's the way it goes. The reason why Red Robin gets my business is because for $10, I know whatever entree I get, it'll fill me up. The burgers itself are huge already, but when you add in bottomless fries to the meal(they cut you off at some point if you are being unreasonable greedy), it's a lot of food. I'm a huge fan of their fries, thick steak cut fries, it's probably my favorite. Their honey mustard and camp fire sauce is on point to dip with anything whether it be fries, chicken strips, or burgers. They have a house seasoning that you can also purchase to bring home. Their freckled lemonade is also great.  This is probably one of the first useful addition of the Renton Landing before it bloom to what it is right now, it's close by the Regal Cinemas so convenience if you were to make this a casual dinner & movie type of deal. During the summers and holidays, they extend their hours.  There's plenty of parking around as this is in the Landing, it might be a bit harder to find super close spots on the weekends, but you will find one. I've been a customer at Red Robin ever since high school homecoming days and the food has tasted the same since then.

Shert J.,"Renton, WA",10,230,41,2.0,5/9/2016,"Friday night-loooong week, hubs and I super tired, so we wanted to eat out, Plus I had a Free Birthday Burger coming.  NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH OUR EXPERIENCE. My bad, I should have complained at the time, but was so tired and bleary eyed, things did not register with me til we got home. NO. 1)  Stupid Trivia game.. saw it, thought it might be fun, so played a little.  WE WERE BILLED $1.99 FOR THIS!  WHAT??? i did not see it posted anywhere that it had a cost...SCREW THAT!  Not worth $2 to play some dumb electronic trivia. 2). Waiter said my birthday burger had to come from the Gourmet burger page.  So hubs and I both looked ONLY at THAT PAGE.  I ordered a California... my hubs said the Blue Cheese, and POINTED TO THE ONE THAT WAS $10.95 ON THAT PAGE. The waiter then said ""Oh, the Black and Blue?""?.  We don't know their menu, so my hubs said ""yeah, sure"".  SCREW THAT, the waiter ""tricked"" us into a $14 burger instead. 3) PAYING THE BILL;  You now pay on these electronic  terminals on the tables (which have the trivia games)...  It asked about tip and I slid the green arrow to 20%.  At home I REALIZED THEY CHARGED ME $9.70 ON A $36 BILL!   That is almost 30%.  WHAT!!! I HATE THE ELECTRONIC terminals....   Your receipt/bill comes out of that... I want a bill that lists what we ordered, what it costs and allows me to fill in any amount I freaking feel like for a tip. We won't be back!  Screw those new terminals, and their sneaky charges.  We specifically went there because our budget is really tight right now and I had the free burger... but it ended up costing a lot more than we planned!   Must say I do love their burgers and fries... but not all these other issues!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=20

Victoria N.,"Fremont, CA",8,6,138,5.0,12/31/2015,"The first thing I'd like to mention is that the overall restaurant itself is really nice! It's spacious, colorful, and family-friendly.  The service our party was provided tonight was extremely friendly. Our waitress, Teri, was very approachable and personable. For example, after our table finished coloring the pictures provided with the kids menus (we're all children at heart), we asked Teri whose picture she thought was the best. This just shows how easy she was to talk to!  She made sure we were comfortable and that we had everything we needed.  Lastly, the food was AMAZING. This may sound like something small, but the meat patty in the burgers was bigger than the burger itself, and there was enough cheese to cover the entirety of the patty. This, therefore, prevents us from eating just bun.  Also, you definitely become full for what you pay for, and you don't have to worry about eating your money's worth.  As for the drinks, the freckled lemonade was very tasty. We probably had our cups refilled at least 10 times.  Overall, we had a great experience here! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=20
Helen H.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"I have been to this particular Red Robin a handful of times and had very little problems with the quality of the food or service. However, earlier today (around 4pm) my mother and I decided to go. When we entered it was pretty slow, there were many open booths, and tables. The hostess/waitress asked for my name and encouraged my mother and I to have a seat in the lobby.  Two men that entered after us were also greeted but were immediately asked by the waitress where they would like to be seated. My mother was very disappointed by this, however, I assumed there must be a good/reasonable reason why they would try to accommodate them even though we arrived first.  In the entire 15 minutes we sat in the lobby, two waitresses stood behind the front podium talking amongst themselves. They even discussed very loudly where they should seat my mother and I (even though there was an entire empty seating section). Finally, the waitress acknowledged us and sat us at a corner table right beside the front lobby. After placing the menus on the table, the waitress walked away. My mother and I looked at each other in complete shock at the lack of courtesy and service. Moments later we decided to leave in order to avoid further issues.

Simon F.,"Renton, WA",124,30,4,2.0,10/15/2016,I'm not sure what Red Robin was thinking when they place those machines on the table. It's the equivalent of the check out lines at stores now a day. I used to go there for the family environment and customer service. Now if you choose not to use the machine and actually have the waiter take the order you are looked at funny and treated with an attitude. Im busy with my kids and have no time to be a waiter as well. Red Robin needs to go back to human interaction rather than directing people to those machines.

Knowing such a slow service, I order fries refill as soon as our food came. Then 15 mins after we finish all our food, the fries refill still hasn't come. The whole time my server never came to check on us. It was a tough challenge to flag my server down finally for 1 drink refill in the course of the whole meal when all our drinks on the table went dry most of the time. We gave up on the fries and wanted our check and leave. Took another 20 mins and 3 request for the check before the manager finally came. He acknowledged there is a problem and try to make it right to give us a discount on the check. That's the 1 star they actually earned The worst of all, the place wasn't packed, there were open table around us most of the time.

At first I thought it was me, but upon reading other reviews first I realize I was not simply being picky.  Twice now I had visited Red Robin in two different locations and found the problems to be exactly the same. They are slow, not like ""I had to wait 10 minutes to order"" but just super slow from taking the order, bringing the food, getting a server, getting the basics like water and napkins"" not to mention even cashing out took awhile... The service was terrible, me and my husband made the most of it and laughed it off but we knew we were never coming back.  Places like this never change, there is no chance it will. It will only steadily get worse until the customers are gone and a new resturant takes over.  We were seated and waited, waited, waited. I don't blame the waitress but management at this point. How do you not know how to hire enough to keep the place moving? The food was delicious, but thats for the one star. And oh yeah, those bottomless fries they like to advertise about? You never see them. If you can wait it out for about an hour you will get about 18 fries in total . Apart of me wants to believe its because of revenue and other people eating more fries than food, but it just feels really cheap tactic and a sign of the times with the economy.  Make sure when you come you bring napkins because this place is so cheap and slow you might not ever see one... Lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=40

Also, I could have sworn that it was vanilla based, and the waiter didn't know.

Food: I had prime chophouse. I thought it was middle rare. But, it felt more like middle well. The meat was dry. My coworker had to dump some good amount of BBQ sauce on. Though, I had to say the fried onion really added good crunch to the burger. I thought that part was good. All you can eat fries was nice, but how many time can you really refill? I only did once!

Juyoung L.,"Mercer Island, WA",145,192,142,1.0,3/15/2016,"I am a fan of red robins but this place has one of the WORST customer service I ever had in a restaurant. I came here a couple times before and I noticed they always forgot a couple things in my orders, like a soup, extra sides, etc. Nevertheless, I decided to give them another chance. Yesterday however was absolutely horrible. I went in for to-go to get a quick grab before I went to work. It was a little after lunch time, around 2:30pm, I put my order through the bartender girl and asked how long it would take since I had to quickly go to work right after. She told me it would only be15 mins which is reasonable so I paid and waited. After 15 minutes passed, I checked with the bartender and she told me they were packing my order so it would be out soon. Another 15 minutes later I wait by the table and the bartender gives me looks but doesn't even check on my order. I asked a server passing by if he could just quickly check my order since I waited 30 minutes. At this point I was running late so I asked them if it wasn't ready yet then I might have to refund the money since I had to go to work soon since it was way past the wait time they told me it would be. The bartender, ""oh so attentive"", overhears me talking to the server, stops the drinks she was making and stomps over to me and yells ""I told you. I said earlier the food was coming, it's getting packed. I told you this already, it's coming okay?"" with her fingers pointing and shaking at me. This obviously raised a lot of attention making the place really uncomfortable and for me, really shocked that she was being extremely rude. I understand she was a bit busy so she was probably frustrated but don't ever, EVER give your customer an attitude. You represent the business. I told her that she didn't need to give me an attitude and she rolled her eyes, gave me the bitchiest look and went back to tending the bar. So dear Red Robin, idk wtf you guys are doing about customer service but you guys should get your shit together and try to hire more appropriate people because I am never coming back to this place again.

Offer of second beverage came too late.  On leaving there were 3 open tables in our area &'yet the lobby was full of people waiting for seats. Obviously there is a missing link in assigning tables.

Sir S.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,31,2.0,4/12/2015,"It's gonna sound like a broken record, reiterating much of what some recent review have said about this RR. Great location , salty fries , inattentive server , indifferent service , badly made burger , dirty bathroom . Aside from the location part, it's pretty negative.  I've patronized RR for over 30 yrs, I feel I'm qualified to complaint. The last couple of times to this particular locale has got to be the worst (food-wise) in all my experience with RR. From the get-go, the maitre'd seem genuinely surprised that two adults don't want to sit at the bar. No bad attitude, just a surprised look on her face. Then came our server, D, who seemed all flustered before even greeting us. Must've been a busy busy shift. Everything from burgers to fries were very (extremely) salty. Hey, aren't we all suppose to eat healthier, cutting down on the sodium?! Apparently the line cooks decided we were all salt-deprived. Patties were way under-cooked. Also I literally spent more time waiting for food, drinks and our server than eating my dinner. As some of her tables starts emptying out, she got harder to track down. Forgetting the requests for sauces, refills on fries and drinks (even after acknowledging our requests). I know wait-staffs work hard, but I'm not in a habit of training or tracking them. The attitude of the staffs were cordial, if not pleasant; which is alright with me. And maybe the only saving grace for this RR. My last time here was last year around March. Why so long between visits? That last time here, their kitchen ""crashed"". Why? I don't know. But when you see the manager cooking and wait-staff all confused, it can't be good. Again, their attitude was the only thing preventing a 1-star rating.

They didn't answer us. They kept seating everyone else that had walked in after us which was like 5 other groups/parties. The one girl hostess told the (we think manager guy) that we had been waiting and he just gave a look of ""don't give a f**k"" and kept seating everyone else. No one was helpful or friendly and couldn't even give us an answer when we asked how long it would be. We left and went to the nearby restaurant Papaya....and was seated right away and the staff was very friendly!

Whitney C.,"Vancouver, WA",1,17,5,1.0,6/11/2016,"Red robin, why must you disappoint me so? We came for lunch. It was fairly busy but we were seated right away. When our server finally came over he forced us to use the table top computer thing because they were having some kind of competition. If we had wanted to order our appetizers on that, we would have done so ourselves. Drinks took forever to get to us and we had to ask three times for extra napkins. Meanwhile a manager was literally standing 5 feet from our table our entire meal and never once asked to see if we needed anything. Drink refills were slow and he had to keep coming back to ask what we wanted. We waited 39 minutes from when we ordered to when we received our food. I upgraded to the garlic parm fries and they looked like they were yesterday's. My burger had barely any BBQ sauce on it despite ordering the whiskey river BBQ burger and it was like warm. It was very lackluster. When he brought out the kids meals he got one of the sides wrong. He then argued with me when I told him they had asked for apples and not oranges. Finally he looked at his book where he wrote it down and realized yes, in fact they had asked for apples. Probably top 10 worst service I have gotten, ever.

Kim H.,"Hansville, WA",1,62,,1.0,5/31/2016,"Our first time at this location and definitely our last. 1.) We had a large party of 12, so we called as we were leaving home and told them we would be there in 30 minutes. The hostess said no problem, she put us on the list and start getting our table ready. It would only be a 5 minute wait once we got there. We arrived on time and found out that after we called a baseball team came in, so they gave our table to them. We then had to wait for 40 minutes to be seated. 2.) While we were waiting, we saw an ad for a gift card deal: purchase X amount in gift cards and get free tickets to see the new X-men movie. Great! We were planning on spending a large amount and a member of that party was planning on seeing the movie later that week. We went up to the front desk and purchased $200 in gift cards. AFTER the transaction was processed, the restaurant employee told us that they couldn't be used for 24 hours. That information would have been helpful before spending $200. The manager came over and processed refund. Its been 3 days and the money still hasn't been put back in the account that was used to purchase the gift cards. 3.) About half of our party ordered milkshakes or root beer floats and the other half ordered water or lemonade. The waters and lemonades were brought to the table within 5 minutes. 10 minutes after those had been delivered, we asked the waiter how much longer our milkshakes/floats would be and he said, ""Oh didn't I tell you? Our ice cream machine is broken."" I'm not sure if he took our orders knowing full well that he couldn't deliver them, or if he found out afterwards and just didn't tell us. 4.) Since we had arrived hungry and waited 40 minutes longer than we had expected, we were starving by the time we sat down. To keep the 6 kids in our party happy, we asked for 4 orders of bottomless fries right away. The kids devoured the fries and we asked for more (they're bottomless fries, right?) We never got any more fries. We must have asked our server at least 5 times and even grabbed another employee and asked for some, but they never came. Our server kept saying, ""Oh, let me go grab those fries for you"" but he never came back with fries. 5.) I'm not sure if our server was overworked or just bad at his job, but after our food was delivered he disappeared. We all finished eating and sat there for 20 minutes, waiting for the bill. Finally one of our party got up and searched the restaurant for our server to ask him for a bill and some boxes. He brought the bill but no boxes. I got fed up and just walked straight back into the kitchen and got the boxes myself. The one positive of this experience? The food we got was pretty good. Although it seems this was more due to luck than anything else, as the woman at the table next to us was served a completely blackened chicken burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=60

Inna B.,"Bellevue, WA",840,1116,3126,4.0,7/15/2013,"Red Robin is usually pretty consistent, so... there's no reason for me to talk about their food in detail. The cool thing about this location is that we stopped by because a friend was meeting up with 15-20 people at about 10pm, and the employees at this already pretty busy RR were able to easily handle the surprise. The ""normal"" food was pretty good as usual, but they weren't that great when it came to figuring out what was and what wasn't gluten-free (even though they have a special menu to address allergies). I think my boyfriend's burger was wrapped in lettuce because of the gluten intolerance he mentioned, but they still allowed him to order a burger that included breaded fish. He didn't realize that it would be breaded, and the employee apparently didn't think about it. We've encountered one other RR employee (in Woodinville) who WAS super careful when it came to allergies/intolerances, but looks like that's probably not the norm. We're not likely to go back anytime soon because we don't spend much time in the area and he wasn't that happy with how ordering ""safe food"" went, but for some big groups this RR can be a great gathering place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=60

Kristin D.,"Renton, WA",0,25,4,2.0,3/21/2015,"We moved to Renton from Puyallup in July. We go to Red Robin at least three times a month. We LOVE Red Robin - their bruschetta chicken and their whiskey river bbq burger is delicious, paired with their bottomless fries with ranch and campfire sauce on the side.  This location is all fine and dandy if you're here just to hang out and look at the menu. The waiters and waitresses are rude, and to go orders take LONGER than if you were to stay and eat. I will say that i have not experienced the ""restaurant"" side of the building - we have only ever eaten in the bar.  The last (and final) time we ate there - well, tried to, was on a Saturday night at 10 pm. Literally sat down at ten in the bar (they close at 11) at a table right across from the actual bar. There were probably 4 other customers (couples or families) in the bar area. The waitress came over, took my boyfriends' drink order (one beer) while i said i'd just have water for now. Literally 25 minutes later, we are still waiting on his beer. The waitress had walked past us twice without saying a word, not to mention a couple of other employees. The two bartenders are chatting to themselves. The couple that sat down behind my boyfriend that had walked in after us had already received their drinks and had their order taken. He gets frustrated. I get impatient. He wants to leave. I say ""Five more minutes. If at ten thirty, if she doesn't come back, we're leaving."" Ten Thirty rolls around and we get up, i grab my purse, and walk out. The two bartenders stop talking and look at us, but say nothing.  We've gone to the Tukwila location since then, and they have been excellent. Food well cooked, employees have a great attitude and are happy to recommend their favorite choices. Never too busy.

But after my experience today, I don't know if I'll ever visit a Red Robin again.  We attended the one at the landing in renton tonight for my cousins 15th birthday. There were about 15 of us at a table. It started out great; got our drinks and appetizers fast. Halfway through my drink I noticed my glass was dirty; caked on food near the top, I was extremely grossed out. Then came our meals...... I ordered the clucks and fries buffalo style. Now I've ordered this plenty of times and each time it comes cooked in buffalo sauce. Mine came out as regular strips and two cups of sauce on the side. I told him and not only did he not offer to take it back but the sauce looked and tastes like 90% oil, 10% buffalo sauce. Then my uncle who ordered buffalo wings, ( which he got 15 mins after everyone already got their food) came out with just.... Drumroll..... Sauce on ONE wing. Sent it back. They put sauce on two more wings .* rolls eyes*  During the meal, none of us got refills unless we stopped him and asked for one. On top of that we didn't get napkins until AFTER we finished eating. Not one time did the waiter clear any of our plates, even our appetizer plates were on the table when we left. He brought our desert out with the tables full of empty plates and glasses. And even after desert nobody cleared our tables. Not once did anyone apologize.  It was the worst service I've had ever, and I will not recommend this location to anyone.

Destinysands ..,"Shoreline, WA",0,6,,1.0,12/28/2015,"We went in on the 26th of December after running errands. It was decently busy, however it was outside of Lunch or Dinner (in between) so not terrible and no wait at all (bar was about 60% full and restaurant about the same). We sat in the bar and it took almost 10 minutes for us to be able to order drinks from one of the 3 people behind the bar. Got drinks fairly quickly and then ordered food. I told the server that I was having blood sugar issues and would like my fry ""refill"" right away. It took 30+ minutes, and it all came out at the same time.  30+ minutes for two burgers, one of which was a garden burger that takes about 2 minutes to heat up (and was barely warm when I got it)..... Food tasted good, although it would have been nice for the server to come back and ask how it was. Or offer us more fries, etc., before we started to pay.  With the amount of time it took to get the food, I started looking around at all the decor. That is when I noticed the huge amount of dust and cobwebs on all of the wall art, ceilings, ceiling fans, window sills, wall molding, blinds, etc. It was disgusting! I walked to the restroom and the remainder of the restaurant did not appear to have this much ick. Seemed odd.  I called the manager over as I was about to go out the door and pointed out the cobwebs and dust to him. He said that the dust was from the construction during their recent renovation - which was months ago. I asked then where were the cobwebs from that had obviously taken a long time to collect that many (I even took pictures of it because it was so gross and I couldn't believe it). He had no answer.  It is obvious that this store does not care at all or take pride in its appearance. They are in a busy location and it appears that think that as long as they are making money, why should they care? There are so many other places to eat at the landing that cares about guests and the cleanliness of their restaurants - go somewhere else. If you are really craving RR, there are plenty of others in the area that you can get to within 15 minutes or so that care about cleanliness and customer service and food wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=80

The person who wrote our names down for the wait time was the only nice person we came in contact with all night. The female who sat us was rude.

If the waiter would've just informed us that he made a mistake or the kitchen made a mistake I would've been fine. Things happen. I spoke to a female manager & she basically just rudely brushed us off. She said she was going to check on what was going & never came back. The waiter came out with the food & still no explanation on what was going on. Placed the food down & left. We ate, the food was COLD.

Marco Z.,"Renton, WA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Consistently bad. Today was the last straw. Ten minutes to get a table, when they weren't full. Another five to get a server, who announced she would be serving us because the one who should ""was overwhelmed."" We ordered right then and there because we knew they were slow and had checked the menu while waiting to be seated. The only prompt thing was the water, which I got over my leg and table as she set it in front of me. She didn't even acknowledge the spill, which, at the moment, I was willing to overlook as a mistake by an overworked staff member. Twenty five minutes later, we got a salad with rotten lemons, a greasy-soggy burger, and my soup. Another five minutes to get the full order after we pointed out that my wife was missing her dressing. She did drop by to check a couple of times, which earned her brownie points, but the kicker was the time needed to pay the check: seven minutes to get the check after asking for it (I was timing it by then), fifteen more for me to go looking for my credit card I the kitchen area. That was after being told by the diners at the table beside us that they had received it with their checks, and that was when the manager was doing their close-out. Five years ago they were ok. They always got something wrong with our order, but they were always prompt, courteous, and had reasonably tasty food. It's been several years that they've grown progressively slower, more disorganized, harried, and even a little hostile. Plus the food now is crap I could get at the $5 all-you-can-eat, and not have to wait for it. We're never going back.

My complaint and lack of two stars was given because every single time we order To-Go, the food is always mediocre or the order is wrong. I'm not sure why anyone would think that 11 cold fries is a decent side for anything. Honestly, they should do what Applebee's does and bring the food out to you when you park. By doing this, maybe you can take a large scoop/handful of fresh fries and dump them in the container right before taking the food out. It just seems like a better way to go. Also, I recently chose coleslaw instead of fries, and it came with literally NO dressing on it. The campfire sauce for my husband's fries was forgotten and my burger was just okay. Hardly any onion straws and it was super sloppy. Not worth the price. This never happens inside when we sit down. Again, I have no idea what the issue is.

Debra Y.,"Renton, WA",0,22,,1.0,7/14/2014,"I am giving them one star, only because the manager followed us out, to ask us if there had been a problem.  Where do I begin? Let me start by saying I really like Red Robin.  This was the second time I've been to this location at Renton Landing, and NEVER AGAIN!!!  My first visit was on a Saturday evening, and I attributed the poor service and wrong order to the staff being overwhelmed by the weekend crowd, and the fact they had just recently opened.  Our waitress was not friendly, the fries were cold, and we received the wrong burgers.  We decided we could deal with the burgers, but asked for hot  fries.  Our waitress all but grabbed our baskets from us, and slammed down some new ones about 15 minutes later.  She was mad???  We ate, left and hoped things would get better once the staff got rolling.  Seems things have only gotten worse.  I visited again today with my daughter and grandchildren, and it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  We were greeted by an unsmiling ""hostess,"" who became hostile when we requested a booth.  She seemed to need to confer with a young man who appeared to be the greeter.  She told us there was only one booth we could sit in, despite the restaurant being practically empty.  She took us to a booth right outside the restroom, and when I sat down, I sank into a large ""hole"" in the seat.   It appeared the springs had broken.  Since we were obviously being ignored, we finally got up and moved to a nearby booth.  Finally, our sassy little waitress (who appeared very put out) came over.  I apologized for moving, and explained the problem with the seat.  She made no eye contact, and informed us that ""lots of people sit in that booth, and it's fine.""  With that, she slammed some water on the table and left.  Even her thick silver eyeshadow couldn't make up for her bad manners!  We decided we weren't sticking around for the next scene, and walked out.  The manager caught up with us once we were out the door, and we told him about our experience.  He asked us to come back in, and offered to buy our meal.  We declined.  We walked down to the new Torero's, where we were greeted by a smiling hostess, shown to a booth, and had a delicious meal!  Our waitress was wonderful, and we left her a nice tip.  I am truly baffled as to why the manager of the Red Robin allows his restaurant to operate in such a shoddy manner.  He is responsible for his staff, and desperately needs to train and oversee them the way someone in his position should.  Chasing down the customers as they walk out, is like locking the barn door after the horse gets loose.

I was placed on hold because THEY were OUT of what I wanted. Somehow that was my fault too, and since she was ""SO BUSY"", she couldn't possibly wait for me to try and pick something else out. So frustrating and unacceptable. They need a specific way to order to go. Maybe take tips from Applebees, and have someone specifically do To-Go orders, and even bring them to you like THEY do. Also, there is no way to order online, so you have to be subjected to them huffing and puffing while they wait for you to place an order because they are ""SO BUSY!""  AND because I've placed orders to go in the past, they are usually rushing you, and ALWAYS forget something you were specific about, and they also serve cold nasty food vs. dining in.

Elena M.,"Seattle, WA",48,511,22,3.0,5/21/2012,"Sorry, RR, but you're getting taken down a notch. Stopped in the other night for a late night nosh.  My husband specifically wanted to go to RR so he could get a plate of nachos.  So, he was disappointed to see that RR recently changed its menu and is no longer serving nachos.   (He was so disappointed, in fact, that had we not already ordered and been served drinks, we would have just left.) If it was just that one menu change, the star would probably still be in tact.  But, we noticed a lot of other changes, too, that did not please us.  For example, there used to be a number of pasta dishes on the menu, and these are also no longer there.  Now, I admit, 90% of the time when I go to RR, I order a chicken sandwich of some sort -- and my husband orders a burger.  But, it was nice to have the other dishes as a menu option -- for example, when one of us was in the mood for his/her ""usual"" and other was not.  Having these no longer available will probably mean we do not go to RR as often. Also, on the night when my husband did not eat the no-longer-available nachos, I was not feeling particularly hungry and so just ordered a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup.  And, it was a good thing I was not feeling particularly hungry because the serving was small!  Really small!  So small, in fact, I had to ask if it was really the ""bowl"" I'd ordered as  I thought I might have accidentally been served a ""cup"" instead.  A bowl of soup should be a small meal, not a side dish.  And this was definitely side dish size.  I shudder to think of what the ""cup"" looks like.  Also, the soup was not served with a roll or even a couple of lousy saltines.  It has definitely been my experience elsewhere that soup is usually served with something of that ilk..

We mention this to one of the waitresses and she takes our drinks and after about 10 minutes she comes back with what tasted more like Sprite but still didn't seem entirely so. Since when do restaurants water down soft drinks? Our waitress was extremely awkward and borderline rude; I suspect she was a new employee but even so, shouldn't kindness and a smile be present even if she hasn't yet memorized the menu? She would come ask us if we needed anything: the first time, she held her hands together and she asked me in a way that made me feel like I was her boss, like she feared I was going to shout at her. She spoke barely audible and with the loud atmosphere that is typical of Red Robins, made communicating with her difficult. The second time she asks us if we're alright, we were eating and clearly had no drinks on the table (another waitress had taken them to replace). How does she not notice this? We're eating without any drinks... Food was ok, I got an average burger and mac & cheese that had no flavor whatsoever while my companion got a chicken burger which she herself said was too small, and this is coming from someone that weighs about 90 lbs.

I ordered the cod fish sandwich and my mom ordered one of the ""gourmet"" burgers. She ordered her burger medium rare and Im not even sure why they asked as it came medium well. The patty was mushy with some unappetizing sautéed/carmalized union ontop a bun with an onion ring ontop amd a steak knife stuck through the entire burger. The steak knife happened to be the only utensil we received and later had to ask for napkins. My mom said it was one of the worst burgers she had ever had. My cod sandwich was tasteless, gooey and they skimped on the tarter sauce. I couldnt even taste it. We never got our ""bottomless fries"" that the menu had talked about.

Meaghan B.,"Tacoma, WA",43,243,9,3.0,4/10/2012,"Oh, Red Robin. I want to like you. I really do.  The thing is, you keep letting me down.  You see, the thing is that we have food allergies and a kid.  I'm aware that's hard - I'm cool with a lot of questions, a little bit of a longer wait and that lovely $1 surcharge you tack on to each item for an ""allergy alert.""  Well, that is I would be if you would actually pay attention to the order.  The first step is getting the allergy menu - which they never seem to have handy and changes every month. If you get one, keep it if you are likely to come back - it's a print-out and they throw them away after each diner. Good news: they have gluten-free soy-free dairy-free buns from Udi's. Bad news: They frequently forget and send the burger on a regular bun and then slide it over to the gluten-free bun when you point it out (food allergies don't work this way, folks.)  Or they burn the bun. Or they accidentally put those shoestring onions (batter-dipped and deep-fried) on it.   No problem, you say, I'll just go the standard gluten-free route and order a salad - no croutons.  Good luck getting them to leave the Red Robin seasoning (gluten and soy contained within) off of it, especially if you don't order a dressing. Watch croutons be picked off of the salad, crumbs still visible. Additional hiccups we've had:  a waitress pressuring my two year old to finish his plate, ""you wouldn't want to upset Mommy, right?"" Hey, lady, food police your own kids - mine eats pretty well and I never, ever pressure him to finish anything. Plus, he's _two_ - I don't think he's capable of clearing his meal at Red Robin. We can box it up and take it home if it is that important to you.  waitstaff disappearing for 30 minutes at a time during that post-lunchtime-lull. Ever try waiting at a table for a check with a two year old who was done eating twenty-five minutes ago? the diet-soda switchout. I can't drink diet soda. Yuck it up all you'd like about how the fat lady is allergic to diet soda, but I'd prefer to make it home without a seizure. Once I asked ""is this diet? It tastes off."" to be reassured it was not, then had a reaction anyway; the second time I didn't fully notice until I was mid-reaction. Thankfully, both times I was not driving the car. I now order unsweetened iced tea. This location is a bit noisier than other locations I've been to - which is saying something. Come prepared to sign or shout or jot notes or something. Why do I keep coming back?  Well, food allergies are tough to deal with. Most places that can even handle food allergies aren't kid friendly - think ""bistro."" So, this is our *one* available, reasonably priced place for a kid-friendly, kid-approved dinner or lunch out.  We'll be back again, I'm sure; forever with the hope that they'll finally notice on the line when it says ""ALLERGY ALERT.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=160

Blake H.,"Johnston, IA",2,15,,3.0,2/14/2016,"My food has always been great, but I have two complaints, one minor and another major. The minor complaint is that service tends to be slow. The major complaint is that Shari, the server I've had for the past two visits has been shockingly rude. The first time, she complained about bringing me a second refill of fries (I had ""bottomless"" fries with my entree), then complained about the third refill. She became so annoyed that I hesitated from ordering a fourth refill. (By contrast, I usually make it through a seventh or eighth refill of fries--with no complaint.) She also chastised my friends when they ordered a second refill. On my most recent visit, I asked for the BBQ Chicken Wrap without the chicken. (I'm a vegetarian.) She let out a frustrated laugh and then, when she brought me my food, said, ""Here's your SALAD WRAP,"" and then let out a mocking laugh. I was visibly embarrassed. I'm queer, and I'm frequently subjected to mockery when I order meatless dishes because ""real men eat meat."" She's very unkind and discriminatory and I am shocked that she remains employed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=100
James M.,"Spanaway, WA",52,123,44,2.0,12/23/2013,"One thing I like about Red Robin is that they are consistent on the quality of their food.   The Fries are always hot and the burger always cooked just right, and the service great.     But, now lets talk about this one.    Our family came here on a Monday night around 4pm.   The  host put us at a booth, then quickly changed his mind and said he wanted to move us to a table.  He got upset that I ask to stay at the booth.  But, said ok, after walking away and then coming back after asking someone something.     Our waitress was nice, but not friendly.  She took our orders, and after a long wait brought us Fries that looked old, and was cold.  They looked so sad I took a picture of them.  After another long wait our food showed up.  I'm sad to say my Gourmet BBQ Chicken Burger was cold, and the fries still looking on the don't eat me side.  They loaded us up on to many side dressings.  We line the edge of the table with them and took a picture.   Our waitress never did bring us silverware or napkins,  I had to get up and go to the men's room to get us napkins.  (gross I know, but it was better than having food all over us) Our waitress dropped off the bill and it took almost 15 minutes for her to return to get the check.   As, we were leaving she ask if we would like refills on our ice teas to go.   No, but it would have been nice to have one during the dinner.

They've changed the menu, added a few items, which is okay. The red baskets are now only for kids and the burgers are served on a plate with the fries in a little bottomless container (cute, huh?), but they only put like 5 fries in it and you immediately have to ask for more. The most disappointing part of yesterday's experience my burger, it tasted and looked like a frozen patty. I really hope this is not a permanent change...  My other half had the whiskey river BBQ chicken burger and said it was as good as ever. The service was very attentive and helpful, my freckled lemonade was never empty!

Danica T.,"Lake Stevens, WA",1,7,,1.0,8/18/2014,"This was honestly the worst Red Robin experience we had ever experienced and the restaurant was not even busy. When we arrived, the hostess had her back turned to the door and was leaning over the podium like she was bored. When she finally acknowledged us, she blandly asked how many in our party and never showed a hint of a smile or greeting. After waiting a few minutes, I took my daughter to the bathroom and left my boyfriend to grab our table when ready. Upon our return to the front, I discovered that two groups of people who came in after us were seated by a different host who came up  and ignored that our party was there (while the other hostess was still there and did not intervene), this young man was also bland and didn't seem to care about his patrons either. I suggested we go somewhere else at this point, but we decided to just stay since it couldn't be TOO much longer. After about a twenty minute wait, while at least four booths and three tables had been open the entire time, we were finally seated, and when we asked for a booth instead of a table arrangement, the hostess acted as though we were a huge nuisance, and reluctantly with a huff and  puff seated us in an OPEN booth in an area that was already being served, 'so not in a sectioned off for the next rush area'. The server was thankfully friendly and smiley, though lacked attentiveness, we ordered, and ended up waiting another 30 mins for two salads and a child's mac and cheese. To make matters worse, the child's mac and chesse and fries were cold. We asked a bus boy nearby for some assistance, and he looked like he was frightened we even spoke to him. To be clear, we are very patient respectful people.  The bus boy got the manager, who thanked us for letting him know about the child's meal as this had happened already FOUR times that same day... the manager actually admitted that to us. I don't normally feel a need to give negative reviews, but this experience was just terrible. I truly hope they can get their staff on board with the way every other Red Robin operates and soon.

nate j.,"Renton, WA",53,257,66,3.0,5/11/2008,"Aww, man.  I wanted to be the first to review this new establishment!  Note: the Yelp map shows this establishment in a wrong location.   We went for Mom's Day dinner tonight (the kids, 3 and 5, told their mom this is where they wanted to take her out). Food was awesome and the new place looks terrific (but possibly the smallest RR I can remember -- big bar area but seems to be smallish dining area than most RRs).  The new location is one of the first places to open in this phase of the Landing shopping center in North Renton.   The service was so-so, hence the lower rating.  I don't believe it was the server's fault specifically, likely a combination of factors that I'd sum up as it being new and still working through kinks.  Here what was wrong tonight: a long wait for food to arrive (a good thing though, without prompting, they did bring us a basket of fries as an ""appetizer"" while we waited), drink refills took a really long time -- and when they did come, one beverage was incorrect and the other had no syrup, it was just seltzer, and lastly, the fries with one of our meals was supposed to be garlic fries but they arrived as plain fries and the server never brought a ""new"" dish of garlic fries despite they'd said they'd take care of it.      Granted, none of those were deal killers for us, but given prior pretty good experiences at RRs (Tukwila in the last year has been outstanding) we had high expectations going in. Positives that'd keep us going back: ample free parking (a huge parking structure is going up right next to RR plus they have a large lot behind the restaurant), a reasonable offering on the kids menu, and generally affordable prices.   If you're a bus rider, the Metro 240 and Sound Transit 560, 564, and 565 have a stop east of here and a block down (kind of a long walk) with fairly frequent service between North Renton and the Downtown Renton Transit Center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=200

That was until last night, I was so appalled by my experience last night, my friend and her entire family (21 of us total) decided we would not return to the Landing Red Robing again. It's really sad when a place feels they are the only place on the block, and so can treat people like cattle. So many great places have gone in down at the Landing, my friend and I have decided we will never return. Our servers name was Nicole, a red headed girl that clearly hated her job. She ignored our end of the table the entire meal, and only came down after I stacked 8 or 9 pieces of dirty dishes and glasses. When she messed up and broght a beer we did not want, she scoffed at us, then grabbed it off the table, SPILLING HALF of it on me. Granted here is where most people would lose their cool, but accidents happened. Instead of apologizing or showing any sort of remorse, she bolted, even though everyone at my table reacted to the spill. At this point I was a little hacked off. I spoke with the Bartender to close out my tab I had opened with him. At no time during the rest of the meal did the Manager (KYLE) bother to stop by and check in with myself or our table.  This Red Robin shows they don't care about their guests, especially if your party is large enough for them to tack on automatic gratuity. If there was a ""zero star"" on this rating system it is what I would use.

How did they expect me to eat off of this?  After informing our waitress that this would not do, we moved to a booth.            After moving to the booth we were now being ignored by our waitress, presumably because we were no longer seated in her section.  We ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for another waitress to notice we were there, and this was on a rather slow night.  Whatever, we order our food and drinks.            10 minutes later our waitress returns to inform us that they do not have any regular white bread hamburger buns for the burger my date ordered.  A hamburger joint without hamburger buns, are you serious?  They do apparently have some other buns they can use though, so my date agrees to whatever their substitution is.              Our dinner comes out a short while later,  and a server drops off our food minus the silverware I need.  What do they expect me to do, go caveman style on it?  No problem just asked the next employee that passed by for some silverware.  Should I really need to ask for silverware?       Now for the food itself.  The chicken I ordered was cold, maybe room temperature at best.  What do they do, pull it out of a freezer and stick it in a microwave for 30 seconds?  It sure tasted like it.   Same story on the Burger my date ordered, she said it tasted like it was sitting out all night.       After eating what little of our food we could stomach our waitress promptly brought us our check and took our plates. The waitress must have known how bad the food was to not even bother asking if we wanted to take our left overs home.  She didn't even bother asking us if we wanted desert  or perhaps more drinks?   Which we did as we were still hungry from the less than appetizing dinner.  She came back after she saw we were looking at the drink menu and we ordered a desert that long story short was just as disappointing as the rest of the meal.               To top everything off on the way out my date slipped and fell on their greasy slippery floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=180
Bill N.,"Auburn, WA",35,263,,4.0,12/10/2010,"OK, I will admit it.  I like Red Robin.  Yeah, I know it is a chain and they all make the same stuff without much orginality.  But I like burgers and their burgers are pretty good.  I even kind of like their fries.  Yeah, I know they are frozen food but sometimes I just get a craving for this and I am happy that it is within walking distance of the 737 factory.         My boss took our group out to dinner today and the service was great as usual and I had a really good Pub burger.  We often go in with 8 or more people and they have no problems treating us right and even offering separate checks if we need it.  So nothing exciting at Red Robin, but I always know that I will get a good burger with good service.  I will keep coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=180

Emily B.,"Seattle, WA",0,19,4,1.0,10/26/2013,"If I could give ZERO STARS I would.  This place is shitty if you are looking for a to-go order. In the past 2 months we have eaten at red robins probably 4-5 times, and only once was it at this one! We ALWAYS call this red robin first because we live 3 minutes away , but they never ever pick up the phone! We make the trip to the southcenter one and have never been disappointed. We ordered from the landing tonight (hey! someone knows how to answer a phone!) and  the person who took the order was absolutely rude and snippy.  They told us 10 minutes for the order, and we arrived 10 minutes later, and my husband went in to pick up the order and ended up sitting at the bar for 5-6 minutes before ANYONE even asked if he could be helped-- and that was with him trying to get the bartender's attention!! When the short tempered older woman at the bar ended up helping him, she was not personable at all. In our order we'd asked for extra fries and honey mustard with both orders (usually they put the extra fries in a separate box).... one burger had the normal amount of fries for an order, the other had like 8.... and we only had one honey mustard!  This location is horrific, short staffed, rude, and clearly not paying attention to detail on a simple order. i'll make the drive to southcenter from now on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=180

Chris M.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,18,21,1.0,4/19/2015,"The worst red robin experience we have ever had. Certainly not up to Red Robin standards. We were seated after more than 10 other groups who came in after us were seated. Add in that there was a very disruptive family with 3 girls who were yelling and screaming, standing up on the seats, and putting their feet on the table they were at and the manager did nothing even after we let him know about it. The floors were slick and disgusting from food. The fries were cold when we got our food. Our middle girl asked for more Mac & cheese since it is a free refill item and she loves the stuff. The waiter ordered it but it never came before we were ready to leave and so she never got it. And to top it off, the waiter was obviously stressed and accidentally dropped food and a thing of ranch on my fiance when he came to buss our table. Chuckles the manager could only just smile the same smile he wore the whole time we were there and didn't really seem to care. He at least did take a portion on the bill off for us.

Now the bad part, and my girlfriend would give them a zero star, except everybody else's food was good.  She got food poisoning. Within 7 hours. We know it was here because this was all she ate that day. She had the Mini wedge salad with the blue cheese dressing. Sooo, whether the salad wasn't washed or the blue cheese was left out too long, she was not a happy person.   The Manager might want to take a quick look in the kitchen to see everything stays up to code.   I'll be back, but my girlfriend says she'll pass. Hope my review is better next time... Have to say I was impressed. My ice tea was kept full, my fries were hot, and they offered more ranch when I used it up for my fries.

Excellent customer service - most wait staff that don't care would have just let that go serve our food a simple sorry and off they go. Our waiter was very attentive and apologetic and made sure that the manager fixed the situation. Having a friend who is a waitress explained to me that when they don't get tips (due to bad tippers) its basically like the waiter is paying for me to sit in their section.
