16,Christina M.,"South Bend, IN",17,71,,2.0,2012-07-09,"Red Robin is really starting to disappoint me. The last two times I've been there, my burger and sweet potato fries were so salty as to be almost inedible. The BBQ chicken burger would have been so good without the overly greasy, insanely salty onion straws. I let the manager know tonight, and he offered to remake my sandwich but I refused. I couldn't wait another 30 minutes with a toddler on the verge of a meltdown. The restaurant was nearly empty on a Monday night, but it took so long to get our food. Just disappointing. I thought this was one of the better chain/family restaurants in the Grape Road area, but maybe I was wrong.  They will get one, maybe two more chances. My husband seems to like everything he gets.

I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger medium rare.  I was happy I was even given the option of how I wanted it cooked as it seems many chains default to well done/medium well.  The burger arrived quickly and exactly how I ordered it.  The burger was very flavorful and the crispy onion straws were as described, crispy!   The steak fries were disappointing as they were soggy and seemed as if they had been reheated by the microwave.  I ate them anyway and got a second batch since they are ""unlimited.""  The second batch was about the same.

7,Amy Beth P.,"Berkley, MI",2,8,3.0,1.0,2014-09-23,"I want to say positive things about Red Robin because it looks fun, the menu is fun, it seems to want to be fun - however: this particular restaurant has been consistently  disappointed because, of all things, the service.  Our server was completely awful and troll-like. Our food was brought out by a food runner, and we had no silverware. So we asked the runner to get us some, which he went to get. Our waitress Courtney popped her head around the corner and said ""is everything ok here?"" and we said - we don't have any silverware, to which she, shockingly, accused my wife of ""making a face"" when replying about waiting for silverware and  looking across the room towards the man getting our cutlery.  The remainder of the meal was unpleasant, we were worried what she would act like if she came back. She was mostly absent as she must have known she made a faux pas. Further interactions she was short, curt and rude. The strangest thing about this place is that the food is good, there is ample staff, and every time we have given it another chance, the staff totally ruins the evening. Sorry Red Robin. We won't return to the Mishawaka location. Maybe another location has staff that have the sense to see their customers as people to actually be NICE to.

33,Christopher K.,"Loma Linda, CA",99,65,56.0,2.0,2015-01-29,"After coming to this Red Robin over 20 times, the only thing I've really been impressed by this restaurant has been their consistency. Consistently dirty. Consistently bad service. Consistently decent to okay burgers. It's really quite impressive in that aspect. Cleanliness: Almost every time I sit down, I usually find the table quite sticky and thus uncomfortable to rest my elbows on top. The menus, although well designed, are filled with oily residue from previous hands and I'll find the occasional food-part stuck on a page. A very dirty experience overall. Burgers: The one saving grace this place has to offer are their burgers. This is a Red Robin so their burgers are far from what I'd consider exceptional, BUT they aren't bad either! I really enjoy their Prime Chophouse and Bleu Ribbon burgers. My only complaint is that their burgers are usually cooked all the way through even if I ask for otherwise. Another plus is that they do offer vegetarian options for all of their burgers, allowing you to replace the burger with a boca or black bean (I forget which--maybe even both!). Bottomless Fries: It's hilarious to be how they offer bottomless fries but they almost always skimp out on the portions when they serve you. Not only that, but they take forever to bring them out. I find it most effective to ask for fries immediately after ordering our burgers--a simple ""can we start out with fries"" usually does the trick. The fries are pretty good and the sauces are excellent. Campfire is definitely the best sauce there--a mix of ketchup and buffalo sauce it seems. Service: 4/5 times the service will be forgettable to terrible. I can't remember the last time that I had an excellent service experience at this location. Rude, unapologetic, indifferent. I could go on, but what can you expect? It's a Red Robin. Red Robin Royalty Card: Because I come here so often, I eventually got myself a Red Robin Royalty card. For not paying a cent, it's definitely worth it. I've gotten plenty of free birthday burgers as well as a free burger for every 10th time I get one. A nice perk if you find yourself here a lot. Overall: Why do I go here so often? As a college student, this is probably one of the best places to go as a large group for birthdays, celebrations, etc. They can accommodate for 15+ people pretty easily and the food's good enough that it's still worth it to go. Solid for a casual lunch or dinner, just don't expect too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

The sauces, especially the campfire are all very good.  Burgers are the best part, but they made some changes in a few of their recipes and aren't as good as they used to be.

39,Alexandra S.,"Mishawaka, IN",0,3,,1.0,2016-11-05,"DON'T BRING YOUR COUPONS! We do not frequent Red Robin normally. No particular reason. We got an AMAZING coupon in the mail and decided to use it as the only Red Robin restaurant was only about a half mile from our home. It was 50% off a RR finest burger (excluding RR gourmet) so I was pretty happy and in the mood for a burger. We ordered our food and specified ""medium"" when asked how we wanted them cooked. We waited for about 30 mins and our 2 burgers came out. They were extremely well done, over salted, and dry. For some reason (maybe it is default) my burger came plain. When I asked our waitress for some lettuce and mayo she looked at me like I was literally insane. I added to my request, ""is that ok?"" because she made me feel so uncomfortable. I hate when staff at a place I am at makes me feel weird. At the end of the meal I presented the coupon we received, enticing us to eat there in the first place. She took our coupon and came back with a manager. ""These are mostly for chain locations"" she (the manager) says. ""we can't accept this"" ....I'm thinking ""Am I not standing in a Red Robin right now?"" I informed the manager that I had come to their establishment SOLEY because of the coupon and since they are the only location, chain or not, in our area it seemed shady to send coupons out like that. I had the coupon, we ordered 2 burgers, her standing behind the advertisement would have been very appreciated. (I was not ugly with them nor did I raise my voice) She could have easily apologized for the misunderstanding and comped %50 of one of our burgers, kept our business AND gotten a positive management review despite the poor service and overcooked order. However, that did not happen. They both just stood there like I was not speaking English. It was very frustrating. I ended up paying $25 for bad burgers and an extremely frustrating experience.

And you get free burgers after every tenth burger you get there!  It takes forever for me to get there since this is a once every few month calorie splurge for me but for you burger fans that is Def. something you should sign up for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

It was Sunday afternoon around 3:30pm. Not real busy in here. Food was great and everything we wanted. The service on the other hand. I thought maybe I was at a funeral. Positivity and enthusiasm were no where to be found. Neither was the waIt staff half of the time. Not just ours but other tables as well.  There was plenty of staff to go around though. Maybe a stronger manager? Not sure. Customer service was definitely not the strong suite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

25,Debra M.,"South Bend, IN",0,56,2.0,2.0,2017-04-21,We arrived at 6pm and go a seat right a way. But it took so long to get our food. We finally received our food 7pm. The waitress apologized but we never got a realize as to why it was taking so long. It obviously was not her fault. But we did not see a manager walking around the room touching tables. It was kind of chaos.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
34,Rob M.,"Granger, IN",26,5,,2.0,2017-04-21,"I like the burgers. My comment had to do with their poor decision to get rid of craft beers and go with watered down brews. Yuengling is not craft beer, it's a crappy Pennsylvania mass produced beer. There are so many good craft beers in the area, why not have them as an option???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
0,Barb C.,"South Bend, IN",0,7,,1.0,2017-05-04,"This was perhaps the worst meal I have had to pay for in a very long time. I went to enjoy a burger meal with my daughter and 7 year old granddaughter on Saturday evening. Upon being seated our waitress (who was very busy) asked for our drink order before even opening menu. We had not been there before and with no time to look yet just ordered soft drinks. I looked at children's menu to try and establish what my granddaughter would eat, and again before having any time to look at menu the waitress just stood at table wanting our order. We ordered and before long food arrived. The burgers were extremely greasy and buns were therefore soggy. My burger did not come as ordered. We could not eat them they tasted so bad. The waitress removed one and offered something else to daughter. She ordered a chicken sandwich which took 25 minutes. When it arrived, it was dry and tasteless. She could not eat it either.  The.manager, Theresa, came to table as we paid to leave and find food elsewhere. Because I had already swiped my card, she offered to refund most of bill. Said it would take a couple days. I was suspicious that she asked for no information. Well, almost a week later, there has been no contact, and no refund. This food is highly overpriced, not good, and I will never recommend it to anyone I know. I felt sorry for the waitress. She was trying under difficult circumstances. The poor food was not her fault. And she was too busy to spend any time with her customers. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

We shared the delicious ""Fish'n Chips"" between the 2 of us, and ordered the healthier bottomless steamed broccoli instead of the fries - and it was plenty to fill us up! The service was fast and pleasant, and the atmosphere was fun, with lots of families with children. Looked like they had added some nice designs to the decor. Will definitely go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
22,Angelo U.,"South Bend, IN",2,16,29.0,4.0,2017-06-21,"I have been there several times before and I have yet to have a bad experience. On the weekends in the late afternoon ot can be quite busy as it's their peak hours. I opted to sit at the bar which has a price menu listing the different beers and sizes. The beer is a bit pricey.  The menus are well laid out and give a good discription of the sandwiches. Don't like burgers, but the person with you does? Don't worry they got you covered. There are plenty of non burger items. They also have the best poutine this side of the border.  The service was good for it being busy as I didn't have to wait long for my beer to be refilled. The server was polite. When paying with uour card you can use the little kiosk and leave after you pay. The downside is that kiosk can get in tbe way for such a small table. They also have a rewards club. If you want a specialty burger I reccomend giving this place a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
21,Michael M.,"South Bend, IN",9,68,155.0,2.0,2017-08-12,I always get the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich with speckle endless fruit.  I have complained several times about the bread on the sandwich but nothing gets done about it.   The bread is very brittle and falls apart when you are trying to eat it. It's like the bread is old. You will end up having to clean your hands when you are done.  The freckled fruit is nice that is endless and had very good taste to it.  I'm told I can get a different bun but I always forget. Maybe if they fixed the original bun so it will work without falling apart. This is the only Restraunt I have a problem with.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

Empty tables, instead place you right next to kitchen prep area.  Also, be prepared to wait an eternity for your food.  They have disclaimer on menu for ""time to prepare your special burger"" but it's a looooog time.  Probably won't go back even though we had free birthday burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I was pleasantly surprised with my most recent visit. I got the A1 burger and it was good! And the carry out containers are superb. Sturdy and kept the food warm for a length of time! The one thing that was confusing to me is they were telling people there was a 20 min wait and there were quite a few open tables so that was questionable. But I carried out so it didn't effect me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
