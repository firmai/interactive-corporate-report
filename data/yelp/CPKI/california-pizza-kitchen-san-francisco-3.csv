Nick O.,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",6,41,3,3.0,2/8/2008,"I have some rules about what makes authentic Italian pizza: very limited ingredient range, flavorful sauce and just a little cheese, and thin crust, all cooked until crisp and bubbled in wood fired oven. CPK breaks almost all of these rules, but I actually enjoyed my barbeque chicken pizza a lot. The crust was good and crispy and thin, instead of the soggy ones you get in a lot of places. I'm told the prices have gone up a little, but the pizzas are satisfyingly large for the price (circa $10). With its thai green flavoured pizzas, and many others, this place probably offers a good example of Californian desire to mix things up. Although in my opinion sticking all these things on a pizza does not really constitute true fusion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-3
