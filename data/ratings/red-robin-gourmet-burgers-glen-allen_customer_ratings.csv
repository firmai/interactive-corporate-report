7,Anthony C.,"Glen Allen, VA",31,51,58.0,3.0,2012-04-01,"Neat burgers pretty good onion rings rock... got salad avoid cobb The RR has great specialty burgers.  Always good portion, but you do pay for it.  Think they might be a little overpriced, but normally you a great burger.  I love there onion ring tower.  Thick onion rings piled up on to form a tower and a few dipping sauces to plunk them down in.  I can put it in words, they might not be your normal onion rings, I have had better, but none like these,  They do taste good, just a different kind then what you get at most places.  I normally always get the tower.  Tonight I got the Avo-Cobb Salad.  Was pretty tasty.  Again good portion.  Most of us all enjoyed our food. Biggest complaint that I have with RR is the wait staff.  I have been there and have great service, but more than not,  we don't get good service.  Usually young kids waiting on you.  Don't know if they can handle the amount of tables they get or just ""disappear"", but we got horrible service tonight.  Slow to refill drinks or get our food out.  Asked if our kids food could come out first, since they were starving and it came out with the rest after a long wait.  She did, bring us some french fries early to nibble on, but don't like feeding my 9 month old french fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
5,Robert M.,"Ravenna, OH",100,748,784.0,3.0,2012-11-06,"This is a tough one.  I went with the family for dinner so I will give you all of the feedback. First, the server, 'Addo' was his name.  He is a huge bright star for this place.  5 stars for hiring him.  Very friendly, provided suggestions, was engaging with the family to include the 5 year old.  He was really fantastic. Onion Rings, fantastic. Guac burger was really good according to my daughter.  Will repeat. Whisky/Burbon Burger - Wife has had before at other locations and was a little disappointed, but in general it is still quality burger. Bacon Cheese Burger - This was mine.  According to the menu, they feel this is the best in the burger universe.  I must say if what I got was their best, they need to get out more often, even to BK.  This was sad, sad, sad.  First, I ordered no tomato, with slaw.  What I got was with tomato and no slaw.  Then, I opened the bun and there was one slice of bacon in total, that had been cut in half and layed side by side, in the edge of the burger.  Let me tell you that the bacon is paper thin and even laying side by side only occupied 1/4 of the burger space.  Addo recovered with an additional 2 full slices of bacon.  I believe it supposed to have 3 total slices.  So, either the kitchen was instructed to cut corners by completely screwing the burger up, or the staff does not know how to read.  Or something in between, but none of the options look too flattering. So I would return, I would not order their Bacon Cheese Burger and I would make sure you check.  Addo is the man, so I hope you get his service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

11,Melissa M.,"Columbia, MD",1,3,,1.0,2013-10-06,"I've never been to Red Robbin before -  I've wanted to go, but just don't have one near me - plus we were staying at the hotel right next door so we decided to stop in for dinner. Took the server 15 minutes to greet us - then made excuses saying ""the other girl was cut and no one told me that I had you"", took another 10 for drinks - 15 for my brothers shake - then his burger came out wrong (all he said was no tomato, lettuce, onion so it was nothing complicated). My brother needed a refill on his water and she took another 10 minutes getting that - then when I guess she realized she had forgotten it she said to him ""Oh, are you ready for that water now?"" ..like what? What I found interesting was that the manager actually dropped off our appetizer - I was hoping that he would apologize, or say he was going to take something off the bill or something but none of that happened - he came over and sneered at us. I can only assume the waitress went in the back and said we were a problem table.  Never checked back on us - took too long to get the check, then she finally dropped it off and I got my card out right away but I watched her walk over and start a conversation with a coworker - I was going to give her the benefit of the doubt but after 5 minutes and her moving to another terminal to continue the conversation I had to get up and give her my card.  It was our waitress' birthday that day - we watched everyone sing to her. It's the only reason she got a tip from us - otherwise she would have gotten a big fat 0.

That's an odd question. No, as my niece was with us, so it took about 4 minutes for them to seat us in the back of the restaurant where everyone else was scrunched in. Whatever. Well then it took forever for our bottomless fries to come out and when they did literally seven fries came out for the four of us. For a place with bottomless fries they sure didn't keep up on making them.  Needless to say, never impressed when I go here. I need to remind myself why not to go back.

27,Tony A.,"Midlothian, VA",145,213,636.0,4.0,2014-07-17,Red Robin has become a birthday tradition in my family. For some reason we always seem to go here for a birthday lunch. The burgers are always pleasant and the milkshakes are to die for. I've been on the Whiskey River BBQ burger lately. There is something about that flavor profile that I can't get enough of. The staff has been pretty consistent over the years. They usually go the extra mile if you want to split a burger. I've never had an order wrong and that's probably why I keep going. This place can get jumping but I've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. The fish and chips might also be a hidden gem if you want something instead of a burger. Over all I have nothing negative to say about this location.  A+,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

Great food, great service, good atmosphere. Came here to use my birthday burger reward with a friend. It's nice that some places still give you more than just a buy one get one coupon, and Red Robin is one of these places. The service was stellar and the food came out just how we ordered it. While this place doesn't necessarily offer anything that unique, it's still nice to be able to have consistently good experiences here. Whenever I see a Red Robin on my search for restaurants in the area, I know I have at least one solid option for dinner. Overall: 4.0 stars ----------- Pros: - Consistently great food. - Stellar service. - Prices are mostly reasonable, especially when one considers the unlimited fries included with the sandwiches. Cons: - Nothing really unique about their offerings relative to other similar establishments. - Don't ever try their claw machines, it's like every location goes out of its way to make their particular machines impossible to win on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

Red Robin has bottomless fries, only if you ask for them, they were never offered.  When we requested them we were still eating, by the time the refill came we were waiting to pack up to get our checks. They only came to even check on us within a minute of getting our food, then they only came back for money.  Summary---request your refill as the first plate comes.  The service was very ""going through the motions"" without ZERO thought to the process of what they were actually doing. Mothers with a baby, good luck.  Their changing table is in the small stall and comes down over the toilet, so you stand at one end of the table and hope nothing drops over the edge, if it did drop off it would land in the toilet.  Maybe they could put the table in a larger stall or even just on a wall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.308,2.6

30,Lauri W.,"Richmond, VA",1508,536,966.0,2.0,2016-01-19,"Let me tell ya'll about last night.  I don't usually write bad reviews, but I gotta keep it 100% honest and my experience at this Red Robin was horrendous last night. I just have to leave a little bit of feedback.  Whenever we go to Red Robin it's never my idea; it's the fiancé's. I admit, they do make a good burger, but when I am craving a burger (which is rare) I prefer to go to Burger Bach. Keepin' it local: It's what I do! Anyway, back to Red Robin. So, we walked in and were promptly greeted by the sweetest hostess, bless her heart. We waited for about 15 minutes until a table was ready for us, so they said.  The table was ready, but the waitress was not. I couldn't even tell you who our waitress was because we never saw her. Another poor guy halfway waited on us the entire time we were there because he was nice enough to cover for the overworked waitress. He saved the day, though. He had one of the best attitudes I have ever come across from someone working in the food industry. He admitted that things were a hot mess but never lost his cool; he was always very polite and did the best he could.  So what made it so bad besides not having a waitress? Well, we never got water refills. It took them forever to come back with anything we asked for. Extra ranch? Sure, but it'll take 20 minutes. First they forgot my fiancée's fries, then when they brought them up there were like 7 fries in the basket. Come on, Red Robin. Really? My chicken tender salad was cold and the tenders were not meaty at all. I was not pleased. If it weren't for our johnny-on-the-spot waiter, I probably would have walked out. This is coming from someone who is far from a service snob!

Every time I come in,  which is mostly to-go, they always tell me that its going to be a,10-15 minute wait. When I get there which is always 15-20 minutes after the call, I'm still waiting an additional 15-20 minutes. What's the use in calling the order in?  And it's not even that crowded most times.  Anyhoo...The wait staff is nice...but I'm usually waiting too long!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

We were seated, the waitress promptly came over and instructed how to use the machine on the table to order, huh? Does she not understand that she is a server? She did take our drink orders and when she got the clue we would not be using the machine grudgingly took our orders. Food didn't take long, but was over cooked. Burger was dry and tasteless. Fries were great. At the end we were again instructed to pay with the machine. I guess customer service is not their thing.

Figured o might as well try something different. Karina the waitress was very nice and attentive.  Got sandwich which was a good size and all the sides. Crab was mostly filler type material with a fishy taste not anything like what I would have expected so disappointed .

The bartender took it back and it came back with what it should have. Eric the manager came out and apologized and was more than generous adjusting my bill. The service is good,it was quick and prompt. Other than the snafu with the condiments on the burger,the only other thing I would say is leave off the red relish that they put underneath the original  burger it's funky. Some may like it .

I do not say this lightly: Ardecia is the best waitress any of us have ever encountered. If Red Robin is smart, it is only a matter of time before corporate snatches her up and sends her around the country to train employees in customer service.  Half this rating is based on Ardecia alone. Without her, it would sit at a solid 2.5-3 stars. Ardecia is what keeps me and my family returning so consistently. She is fast, friendly, and everything is accurate. Definitely not one of those waiters/waitresses who gets annoyed when you ask for sweetener in your tea, if you know what I mean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

28,Cattleya A.,"Glen Allen, VA",9,6,,3.0,2017-04-23,"My experience was mostly good but a couple of things disappointed me. We were promptly seated and didn't wait long for the waiter. I had the raspberry tea which was sweet and wonderful. For appetizers we ordered clam chowder and bacon cheese fries. I was a little skeptical about the clam chowder but it was really nice. Now, the disappointing part. You would think that no one could mess up cheese fries, but Red Robin found a way. First this dish cost $7 dollars yet there weren't that many fries in the basket. Secondly, the cheese was melted kraft single squares. They melted sliced cheese squares! And they only gave us two squares. I don't know if all locations do this but this was not worth $7. I could go home and make better cheese fries with melted shredded cheese or a homemade cheese sauce, but never just cheese squares. Well after that our burgers came and they were good. I had the big buzz mac-n-cheese burger. I notice that they don't give you a lot of fries with your meal or the refill. They only give out kid portions which is annoying. We got our refill of fries when we were basically done with our meal also. The waitress did give us drinks to go however. In conclusion the cheese squares just really disappointed me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

After moving still noone bothered to take my order.  I would understand if this place was busy but i think there were actually more employees than customers.  I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
18,S M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,30,12.0,1.0,2017-11-11,"We have been to several Red Robins and have never had a problem. This place is terrible. We came at night and there were only a few people there, yet it was so dirty. Employees were just hanging around so I don't know why they wouldn't just start cleaning. The silverware looked so smudged and cloudy like it had been washed in dirty water. Every drink I tried was watered down. I told the waitress it seemed that the machine was messed up and she looked at me like I was crazy. I always get a freckled lemonade which tends to come in the wavy cup and it's usually fairly red. Mine came in a large glass and it looked like sprite and tasted like water. I then tried the orange crush and same thing...water. I gave up and ordered a coke which came out looking like tea and tasted terrible. Worst of all I was charged for it. The fried egg on my burger was burnt and that's the easiest part to cook. That was after waiting 40 minutes for 2 meals when no one was there. You would think after 1 or 2 problems with the drinks they would be apologetic and take it off the bill but they don't seem to care..all the employees were talking about was not wanting to be there and wanting to go get drunk. It pained us to even tip at all",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
16,Deborah B.,"Mechanicsville, VA",75,147,194.0,2.0,2018-01-02,"We visited on a Tuesday night and the place was almost empty. We were promptly greeted and seated. We we're shocked at the $13-14 burger prices. We ordered  the tavern burgers for $7ish. Our server was friendly enough, but service was super slow and awkward. When the food finally came, they brought out a single side first. Several minutes later they brought the matching entree and one other entree . A few minutes after that, the third person received their entree. Sadly, the wait did not lead to hot, fresh food...it was all barely warm. The glasses were pretty dirty.  The chalkboards for kids didn't really work. The kids menu was a black and white photo copy that read ""flip for more fun"", but the other side was blank. The restrooms were disgusting, the door lock was non-existent, and the towel dispenser fell open and nearly smacked my son on the head.   When it was time to pay the check, we were told to use the tabletop machine. It wouldn't accept my number for rewards, yet when I tried to sign up for rewards, it told me my number was already in use. So, the server attempted something for 10 mins, but still didn't get it working. Finally, we paid the bill, and in true Ziosk fashion, the machine was out of printer paper.  IMHO, this place is probably not far from closing down. I'd rather hit Five Guys for fast burgers or Burger Bach for gourmet burgers. We will steer clear of this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
