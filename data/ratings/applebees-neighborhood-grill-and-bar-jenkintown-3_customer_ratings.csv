23,Robert F.,"Glenolden, PA",3,75,6.0,2.0,2012-11-15,"Steak quesadilla towers are the best appetizer.  Get the brownie bite which includes a scoop of ice cream for only $1.  Tonight I visited with my aunt for my birthday, however my experience was less than memorable.  The appetizers, most of which were half price (except steak quesadilla towers and cheeseburger sliders).  They were out of pomegranate ice tea.  I asked for ice water with lemon but waitress (Stephanie) failed to provide the lemon.  The appetizers we ordered tasted fine, however the ambiance was less than fine. It was loud, noisy, and distracting with karaoke that goes on from 9-11 pm.  Applebee's resembled more of a bar/nightclub than a restaurant at that point.  I could barely hear my aunt speaking it was so loud.  I won't visit again during this time.  Also, once we told the waitress to drop off the check, she basically disappeared after providing payment.  We stayed for another hour past the time my Aunt paid with no visit from the waitress.  Meanwhile, i was parched and there was no one around to offer or ask us if we wanted anything further.  It also felt like the waitress was getting snippy and rushed us as we were trying to choose our appetizers.  Applebee's management really needs to get involved and properly train their employees and well as provide a nice, inviting environment for customers to enjoy their food and drink.  It doesn't feel like the employees put forth a good effort to render good customer service to their patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3?start=40,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

The Crispy Wonton was very good. It was a little greasy, but worth getting again in the future. The Mozzarella Sticks were undercooked. The mozzarella cheese didn't stretch out when you took a bite of it because it wasn't fully melted, which made it unappetizing. The marinara was too thick and didn't taste right. The appetizer altogether was gross. Our entrees took over a half an hour and it wasn't busy. Our waitress never checked on us and never came back to give us our check. We left an estimate of what we believe that will pay for our entrees and left. The host and hostess should have serviced us instead. They greeted us when we walked in and escorted us with a ""Have a great night!"" This Applebee's is a total fail.

Today, I was served a club sandwich with ROCK HARD bread. It hurt my teeth/gums when I bit into it. I thought maybe it was just me, but when my husband tried it the same thing happened to him.

All I mentioned was the waiter, now let's get to the food. I ordered a steak medium rare, got it, cut into it, and it looked like it was rare. Had them take it back. They come back with a better cooked steak, but it was the same one I returned after cutting into and noticing its condition. I requested a new steak and they made me a new one. And then, while everyone else was putting their left overs into boxes, I was just cutting into my steak. Waiter, awesome.

The menu is completely new with very modern type, new american food. They have a new policy of bringing out food when it's ready so everyone's food comes out at different times making it very awkward when one person at the table has food and the rest of us wait ten minutes for ours,  The waitress was very nice at first but the second my friend complained about their food, she became instantly nasty. We received our food before our drinks. The runners brought out our food and we had to ask them for condiments or anything we needed because our waitress was avoiding our table. When she did walk by she never asked did we need anything, refills on drinks, nothing. At one point we could see her in the lobby laying down on the bench in front of the hosts stand and even walk out the front door for a few minutes. After complaining to the manager who was very nonchalant and argued with me at one point but agreed to take off one of my food items. During this entire time from when we complained about the first food item until when we asked for a manager our server was STILL nowhere to be found. Shortly after that, the manager came with one bill. From the time we sat down, we asked for separate checks to save this trouble. The waitress then comes over after ten minutes with separate checks that are ALL wrong and mixed up. She didn't even speak to us, instead she folded each check in half and handed it to us one by one. It was like dealing with an angry child.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

1,Jo M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,92,,2.0,2016-04-29,"My child picked Applebee's for her birthday dinner.  I had not eaten at an Applebee's in a couple of years but we went to satisfy her.  After the overall experience, I can honestly say I don't feel a need to come back. The pros: The hostess greeted us right away.  We were able to get a seat right away as well.  And our waitress was very nice.  Even after I changed my drink order she wasn't irritated or rude.  She let us take out time looking over the menu, and throughout our dining experience.  We ordered the drink special and it was very good.  My child was entertained with the birthday ""surprise"" (singing and brownie/ice cream). The cons: Overall, the food wasn't very good.  It did have flavor, but seemed a bit on the salty side.  Only 1 out of 3 of us that it was ok.  And how the food was brought out was a major issue for me.  First we received our appetizer (that my child won't eat).  So here we are, eating and she isn't.  Then she received her dinner about 10 minutes after our appetizer.  So now she is eating and we aren't.  Ok, cool.  She is eating.  But it took another 10 minutes for my husband and I to get our food.  So she was pretty much done eating before we even started.  We sat as a family, but we didn't eat as a family. I would recommend to bring the appetizer and kids meal together, or appetizer then all meals together. Also, when we went into the bathroom it wasn't clean.  There was no toilet paper in one stall and there was no hand soap.  It was aroud 7pm on a weekday.  I would think they should have maintained it before the evening crowd came in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

Our server was CARLY P. The service was satisfactory. However, after receiving change from our bill, we asked Carly P if she could break $5 OR give us $1 and keep $4. Carly P said, ""I hope that next time the service is better,"" as she went to get the change. Although I immediately knew that Carly P was being passive aggressive, assumptive, rude and unprofessional, my mother thought that perhaps there as a miscommunication, as unprofessionalism is not something we've come to expect during our almost two decades dining at Applebee's.  When Carly returned with five one-dollar bills, my mother said, ""I think you misunderstood me, I just wanted the change, you can keep $4."" Carly P hesitated, gave a frustrated and rude glare towards my mother and said, ""I hope the service is better next time."" Carly P took the $4 tip, didn't say ""thank you,"" and walked off. Tips are optional, the amount one leaves is solely up to their discretion, and customers do not dine at Applebee's to have unpleasant experiences with their waitress. While it wasn't the worst experience in the world, it was unprofessional and passive aggressive enough that we will NEVER be stepping foot into another Applebee's for the foreseeable future, and we will also encourage our social circle to do the same.

We wanted a refill on our drinks but, haha, our server is nowhere to be seen. We eventually got our entrees. My boyfriend got an 8oz well done steak and I got the new menu item, the butcher's cut, which includes mashed potatoes on the bottom along with cut steak tips, tomatoes and onion rings. My meal was well made and tasted pretty good. The tomatoes with my mashed potatoes were probably not the greatest combination. They messed up my boyfriend's steak twice. The steak came out mooing and told them to cook it until it's well done. MOOOOO! THEY DIDN'T COOK IT RIGHT AGAIN. We got them to just take the steak off the deal.

They have to address this if they want to keep customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
29,Christina H.,"Elkins Park, PA",150,119,259.0,1.0,2017-10-04,"DON'T VISIT!!! I'm not a fan of Applebees but I came in for a special they were running. I had several margaritas and some appetizers. The last margarita I had came with a huge crack in the glass. I alerted the bartender (Robert) and he poured the drink into a new glass and gave it right back to me which is a HUGE safety violation as there could be broken glass in the drink. I left it on the bar, paid my bill and asked to speak to the manager. I alerted him about what had happened. He apologized and offered to give me a free appetizer. As he walked past the bar, the bartender said loudly, ""What, they're trying to get something for free?"" When the manager returned I thanked him but informed him did not need the coupon as  I would not be returning to the establishment under any circumstances after that rude comment. He apologized again but I am appalled at the (lack of) service I received. Violating safety procedures and being overtly rude should NOT be acceptable anywhere. Never again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
31,Johnny L.,"Marietta, GA",71,70,137.0,3.0,2017-10-09,"Came in here on a Monday afternoon right as they opened for a quick bite. The place is in the Burlington Coat Factory/Acme Shopping Center with a few other stores. Me and my wife came in with our daughter for some lunch and ended up being there for quite a while due to the length of time it took for them to get our entrees. We ordered the steak quesadilla and won ton chicken tacos which were brought out promptly and were pretty good no complaints. The waiter was great keeping the refills of my Diet Pepsi in check and overall pleasant. The only thing that ruined the experience was the time it took for our entrees to come out. It literally took 25-45 minutes to bring out some sirloin steak and a friggin salad? Anyhow with the wait being so long the food was not bad, typical Applebee's standards. Maybe they got the order mixed up but was not pleased having to wait that long for our entrees. Will most likely not be back for there are a lot of better places to eat and as my wife would say ""Once is Enough""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
30,Eddie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,4,8.0,1.0,2017-12-11,2nd time here in two months  and it's the last time.  Not a clean place and don't look like they care neither.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
35,Jen K.,"Telford, PA",7,6,,1.0,2017-12-12,"Horrible. Walked out. My daughter and I popped into this location around 6:30 on a Tuesday night. We were sat immediately. Took twenty minutes for the server to come over and get our drinks order. Meanwhile, we ordered mozzarella sticks through the ordering system on the table. Mozzarella sticks came out with no marinara sauce, yet I requested it. Still, no server asking for our entree order. I hit the contact server option on the order screen at our table. He didn't come over but the manager did. By that time I was sliding my card into the order screen thing on the table so we could leave asap. The manager was apologetic but by this time I was over it. We went down the road to Jules Thin Crust and had dinner which was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
26,Tash M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,9,3.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"Called ahead of time to make sure this location was participating in the current promotion of $1 Long Island and they were pleasant. Came in with a couple friends at 9pm on a Saturday, it was relatively crowded so we put our name on the list and went to Burlington for a few. We came for the special drinks and also appetizers. Our waitress informed us there was another promotion going on of 50% off appetizers! Win, win for girls nite out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jenkintown-3,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
