Ari H.,"Newton, MA",17,174,23,4.0,12/9/2010,"Do I need to review Applebee's for you? Do you really need to know the type of food this American restaurant chain offers? Click the website link for the menu. The food/drink here is nothing you can't find at any other franchise location. What I noticed, and it may be dependent on the time of day, is there are regulars. I ate at the bar on a Wednesday night and the redhead bartender, Emily, not only knew who at the bar had eaten there before but what drink they preferred.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Ashley G.,"Chelmsford, MA",76,3,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Worst experience EVER!!!! Little things like brining my daughter regular milk when she asked for chocolate and me unsweetened ice tea when I asked for raspberry can be overlooked. But dirty ROLLED silverware, and cold food can not! Plus there is finding black things floating in your ice water after you've already drank half of it. Applebee's is usually a great experience for my family. This WAS NOT! I'd give zero stars if I could... Being a person who has been in the restaurant business for a long time I M usually pretty understanding of simple errors. This was all around horrible. No doubt the waitress could tell we were not pleased. We waited to be approached by management but that never happened. We won't be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
David D.,"Northampton, MA",0,2,1,4.0,3/2/2017,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants. However, the wife and I stopped in one day while driving by. Our server Brian was amazing and my wife can't get enough of their grilled oriental chicken salad. So needless to say, we stop everytime we're passing through Keene. Unfortunately our main man wasn't working today, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive. We had a very nice lunch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Paul B.,"Somers, CT",269,314,333,4.0,3/14/2016,The service at this location cannot be beat! The wait staff was very attentive and seemed to really care about your experience. The food was very good and the drinks were perfectly mixed. If you're out in Keene and looking for a bite to eat visit this Applebee's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Megan G.,"Manchester, NH",0,2,,1.0,7/19/2017,"I love Applebees, one of my favorite places to eat. But WOW, worst service ever!! My serve was Lacie S. Very slow, never paid attention at all. Always had to flag her down for a refill , check , receipt etc. very annoying & frustrating. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Dan B.,"Jaffrey, NH",0,21,,1.0,10/1/2016,Since when do you need a parent with you to order a beer if youre of age. Absolutely ridiculous and waste of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
John W.,"Putney, VT",377,36,,3.0,6/7/2017,My son and I went to Applebee's on a Friday early evening and the place was pretty busy despite which we were seated and served with excellent speed. Our appetizers were average and filling. Our main courses were double crunch shrimp and BBQ brisket tacos. My shrimp was fine with fries and good slaw. My sin's tacos were a mix of flavored that initially did not necessarily go together. He took one home as a leftover and felt that the flavored melded better as it rested. Waitress was really good and atmosphere was solid. We gave it a high C or low B for a grade.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Cynthia W.,"West Chesterfield, NH",10,6,,1.0,12/28/2016,Cranky server. Food mediocre. But the kicker was when my daughter stepped in vomit right outside the front door (at 9:30pm on a weeknight). Charming.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
R P.,"Chicago, IL",17,52,12,1.0,12/8/2015,"Absolout waste of time.  Went in on Monday night, seated then ignored for 10-minutes.  No one approached the table. Manager was less than 3 feet from me ""chatting"" with the young lady who seated me.  I finally walked out and no one cared or said a word as they watched me leave the place.  Honestly, a little customer service please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Pierre A.,"Quebec City, Canada",1,67,8,1.0,2/10/2016,"This chain os degrading more and more ever time i come. Waitress is so weird, food is botched, over cooked, over salted, very poorly presented. Extremely disappointing 1 * then 40 minutes after lunch got sick as a dog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Rob P.,"Keene, NH",2,60,2,3.0,3/31/2015,Promos are nice but for the price Keene has better choices.  Service is average to poor.  Mozzarella sticks are the cheap frozen junk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Alex P.,"Keene, NH",0,8,,1.0,7/29/2015,"Horrible! Ordered some food for pick up, left to pick it up 20 minutes after ordering. My boyfriend went inside to get the food and they made him wait 25 minutes for our food! Some people went in to pick up their food after we'd been already waiting 10 minutes, and they walked out with their food after waiting for 2 minutes! Ridiculous! And when my boyfriend went to pay for the food (he handed her $30 for a $22 check) the hostess smiled at him and said, ""Keep the change?"" What?? She didn't serve us and we had to wait 25 minutes for our food but she tries to guilt us into giving her $8 for doing nothing? Yikes! The food we waited so long for turned out to be disgusting as well (everything is frozen). Don't waste your money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Marcia H.,"Keene, NH",52,30,40,2.0,3/18/2014,The only reason I come back here is because this is the only place that you can bring your family to eat around here However be warned of the poor management here. Servers are great. Cook must be watching TV since they always get things wrong. It's to bad. Could be a four star place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Joe P.,"Orange, MA",11,189,10,2.0,3/11/2014,"I haven't been to an Applebees in a long time, and now I remember why.  The oriental chicken salad was basically some lettuce mixed in with bagged cole slaw with ginger dressing.  The wings were good, but I wouldn't order a meal here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Deborah F.,"Hendersonville, NC",25,26,1,2.0,7/7/2013,I dont know what the trend is but WHY??? everything is either covered in mushrooms or shellfish (shrimp) I happen to be allergic to both and am terrified each time I go there. Rumor has it that the grill is used for both and the regular food. Cross contamination is a worry.  The staff is friendly (they cover their nose rings and tats) and the restrooms are clean and well stocked. Desserts are yum! and the drinks are inventive and sweet. Too bad they dont have more concern about such common allergies and use a separate grill for such items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Kelli W.,"Middlebury, VT",0,6,,2.0,7/15/2013,Not an experience I'd like to repeat. My recent lunch there had the worst table service I've had in a long time. I understand it's a chain but perhaps the staff could be trained to be friendly? Food was average - nothing unexpected and presented as advertised.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Aaron S.,"Townsend, MA",16,93,19,4.0,8/25/2012,"Very clean, super fresh food, and friendly service! Drinks were tasty and actually strong. Was a busy Saturday afternoon and it was relatively quiet too which was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
Barbara W.,"Keene, NH",0,45,,2.0,1/29/2011,"We ended up here because the restaurant we were planning on happened to be closed for renovation. We decided to try Applebee's because it was nearby, plus we were curious about it since  we had never tried this chain restaurant in the many years we had passed its restaurants in many cities across the country. As we had figured all those many years, this is strictly a production place. Don't count on any genuine enthusiasm from the kitchen staff or waitstaff. Yes, there's that forced, corporate cheerfulness, but no real skill or assistance here.  I ordered a lunch combo plate and was really disappointed. I could tell from the film on the surface of  the cheddar-broccoli soup that it had been ladled into the little crock hours ahead and then microwaved at serving time. They hadn't even bothered to stir the soup after 'waving it, and they couldn't even serve it hot.  They'd also microwaved my Reuben sandwich, which made it soggy instead of crisp. It had no sign of the Swiss cheese, plus the other ingredients had not exactly been piled on. We were eating past the prime lunch hour on a weekday, so they weren't exactly hopping and the kitchen staff should have known better than serving my order in this pathetic fashion. They made it very clear they didn't give a hoot about the food.  My husband had a so-so cup of a tomato soup (which was clearly from a base and not made fresh) and a spinach salad, which was nothing special. He finished before I did, so when the waitress cleared his plate, she also tried to take mine without asking if I was done, although the  plate was still half-full and I was clearly still eating.  We wouldn't give this place a second chance, even if we had a coupon for a free meal. You can do better at any of the places in downtown Keene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
J J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",21,639,81,3.0,10/23/2010,"Fairly good service, not the best.  Food and appetizers very very tasty with large portions.  Price was reasonable.  Atmosphere was better than I expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-keene-3
