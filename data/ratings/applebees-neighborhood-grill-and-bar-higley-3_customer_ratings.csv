61,Ann P.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,1.0,2012-01-13,"Ordered pork wonton tacos as appetizer. Pork was dried out chunks that tasted like the end of ham, sort of like the end rind. Complained, but kitchen manager did not report back and tell me what he found in the kitchen, as both me and my partner thought he would do. Ordered the bruschetta chicken salad. The tomatoes were not made into a bruschetta, but huge chunks. No red onion or roasted peppers to be found, as pictured and described. I have ordered these dishes before in another location and never been disappointed.  Staff needs retraining on the correct presentation and ingredients. The manager did not even offer  to exchange my appetizer or take it off my bill. Your manager can find me if he chooses to make it right. This was at the Power/ Ray Rd location in Gilbert, AZ. My ticket number is TB#41, ordered 2 salads and appetizer. on 1-13-12. Called  Applebee's corporate in KC and was called by the store manager the same day. Funny how that results in quick action as I was issued a gift card. And no, I do not work for nor have I ever worked  for any restaurant or diner or food establishment in the last 30 years. I simply want to spend my money on establishments that provide both good food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=60,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

I went with my mother and sister party of three including I, I gave the host my name and I even spelled my name for her. She warned us it was a 15 min wait and I was fine with that. (I work in the restaurant biz so I have grown some patience) anyway, the host was looking for MARK party of 3, no one was responding so I asked her if she meant MARLI. She said I will check. She never got back to us so we waited a little longer, after 30 min of waited I decided to ask her how much longer, she asked for me name and she responded "" I don't have you on my list"" I laughed at her and said oh maybe I was your mark party. She looked back at her list and said oh I could t read my writing. She apologized and she kindly said we will sit you right away. We got seated and walked up the a dirty table with fries all of the floor and food still on the seats. The male who Sat us said I am sorry we will clean it right now we are just busy.

They wouldn't accommodate a basic seating preference for my elderly mother who had trouble walking.  They made her walk to the farthest side of the restaurant!!  Despite that we sat where ordered.  Then we were completely ignored.  Nobody acknowledged us at all.  Servers walked buy several times.  They wouldn't look at us or even take our drink order.  Thank you for ruining a Christmas Eve for my elderly parents.  For hours my mother was talking to family and friends about the experience and was in tears during each conversation saying that she was in complete disbelief that she would be treated so rudely, especially on Christmas Eve.

My family lives out in Queen Creek and our options around there are very limited. We decided tonight on this Applebee's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the Native New Yorker in Queen Creek.  The food was okay. Not bad but not great. The beer prices are great. The service was good. I had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor. My sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed. I had not been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this because I had some really bad experiences at a location in Chandler over a year ago. It seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit. There are still some staple items that Applebee's has always had but definitely some added items as well. I would say that Applebee's is trying to do too much with this new menu. They have seafood, sandwiches, pasta, chicken, burgers and more it's too much. They should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre. But alas it is a chain. I would visit this location again. It wasn't bad.

Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert.

77,Lindsay H.,"Youngstown, OH",149,222,410.0,3.0,2015-09-03,"Fresh, tasty takeout experience. I see that many of the poor reviews are service-related. We have never eaten in the restaurant but had decent carryout which we ordered online via their website. However, no host was waiting upon arrival and hubby had to stand and ask around awkwardly to find out where to go for pick up (in the back. Go through side entrance). We live about 10 minutes away and they estimated 15 minutes for the following food to be ready: -2 item app combo: crispy green beans and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard -American Standard burger with BBQ fries -4-cheese Mac with honey pepper chicken Everything arrived home hot, fresh and crispy (where applicable). The green beans came without the advertised aioli, so we used ranch from home. They were tasty and did not have as much breading as the Friday's version, in a crispy delish way. The pretzels were ""meh"" but the accompanying beer cheese was awesome.  The burger was good but couldn't taste the bacon, pickles and onion that was minced and mixed/cooked into the patty. We wish that it would have come with lettuce and tomatoes like the other burgers. Ordered well done but was cooked medium.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good and a hearty helping (I have about 1/2 for leftovers). The cheese sauce is nothing unique but I like the use of callentani noodles and the bacon (which I almost asked to omit) was crispy and a welcome change of texture. The chicken sounded a bit lame... ""honey pepper chicken strip?"" I imagined them throwing a chicken strip that had been sitting under a heat lamp on top and calling it a day. The chicken was actually really tasty. Obviously crispy but the sweet/salty combo was great with the creaminess of the pasta. I wish they had they had the option of adding veggies to make it more of a complete, adult dish. We added leftover stir-fried zuchinni, peppers and broccoli and it jazzed it up a bit. The breadstick was pretty old and tasteless and not worth the calories. While it was pretty good, I don't think I would get this again. I will go back to my usual Oriental Chicken Salad or club house grill. Worth a try once, though.  All-in all, it was fresh, well made food. Some of the best carry out we have had in the last year. They offer both car delivery and you going into the carry out area in the back. Just bring cash for a tip for the car service. *edit: we ordered take out again and were there while food was still being prepared. Even so, taco app was soggy and fries were dry, cold and stale. It was clear that they did not time our meal prep properly. Bummer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,1.836,3.0800000000000005

Didn't ask us if we needed a high chair for any of my kids or anything. Just left. We sat there another fifteen minutes and not a single person stopped by. We stared at many workers yet no one heeded our dear in the headlights look. Finally, one of the hostess, k*****, was behind us clearing a table. I simply said ""excuse me, it had been over fifteen minutes and no one has come by our table"" Another look of annoyance and then a very rude Response with a snippy attitude. I asked for her manager who just so happened to be right behind her. I told her of my experiences thus far and then decided to leave. Upon leaving k***** was upfront whispering with her blonde minion. I asked for her name and she held up her name tag and said ""yeah! It's K*****!"" In a very hostile manner. I let the manager know, but obviously this girl has somewhat of a free range because she has no issues being a complete c word to customers. I will never go to an apple bees again. Ever.

2,Drey J.,"Chandler, AZ",151,26,4.0,1.0,2016-01-29,"I hate to write this review. It's a 2 star because the food was good! So my husband and I decided to invite friends and eat at this Applebee's. We ordered the 2 for 20 the artichoke dip, fiesta chicken and chicken fingers and I said I would like to add a desert and right away our server responded ""oh that is not part of the deal"" in a rude condescending voice. I replied "" I know, that is fine!"" He then said he would put the desert in later so it would come out last. Which is was totally fine with me.  We get our food and he comes out with a 3 cheese pasta and fiesta chicken. My husband then says I ordered the chicken fingers, the server then argues and looks at his order book and said no sir that is not what you ordered again in a rude condescending voice. He then takes the food and said we will get you the chicken fingers. Which was nice but if he would have got things the first time he wouldn't have had that miscommunication in the first place. The whole time he treated everyone at our table with the least respect I have ever seen a server treat customers, he in no way went out of the way to please or value our business being there. Oh also he never brought out my dessert he had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert at the end when he was handing out or checks.  So yes I am disappointed I love Applebee's but I don't know what the deal was with this server tonight and I hope we never get him again. I want to say his name was John and he is the one with small Gage's in his ears. So if you get this server beware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,1.6680000000000001,2.8
78,Jamie L.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,64,4.0,1.0,2016-02-04,"So... as many of you know by now- and I now know about myself- apparently(!) I am masochistic and I love to be abused by mediocre establishments. My husband and I ordered Applebee's to go *gulp*  yet again. Traffic was heavy so we weren't perfectly timed when the stuff came out of the... Oven? Microwave?... er... you get the idea. We get home and the food is cold as all get out. (Some how pizza guys can manage to keep the pies hot... but I digress...). The big problem is we did the '2 for $20' special (you know, the one managers here don't think exist) and my husband's fries were missing. And we don't exactly live a hop, skip, and a jump away. Plus my husband has school to be at in a half an hour. So we call and they put us on the phone with some wretched manager named 'Janie'. And Janie is just aghast apparently that a customer would have the nerve to talk to her... let alone complain! Janie has to get the kitchens side of the story because we all know... the customer is NEVER right and their side of the story should NEVER be heard before the staff! She could barely listen to our side first. Janie is unapologetic, unfriendly, and tries to blame us for this. I guess I missed my second job shift as a cook back there. Or maybe I was supposed to be the car side-to-go guy... Well. She says we can come back... Sorry lady- can't do that unless you want to fill my gas tank and sit in a class for my husband. Then she says she can't void a single item on the receipt. But, my husband asks, she could void the transaction altogether and charge us for what we had minus the burger meal. Ummm... well.... Then she hangs up in my husband's face-- or do those landlines get really bad reception these days? Er. Okay so he has to go to school so I call back within a few minutes and the rude guy who answers the phone already knows we are calling and magically and just as unexpected as  a unicorn parted the sky with glittery rainbows the manager has evaporated and is now in a meeting with 'another manager'. And I am beyond pissed off at this point and tell him that is unacceptable, I need to speak to her, and I will wait. After throwing that curve ball that they totally did not plan for because the hang up was like totally an accident *end sarcasm* he tells me she is just going to void the transaction. And he has attitude galore and is totally unprofessional but considering who his manager is... am I suprised? NO. But I am still yelping about it. ;) So, the point is, from my perspective, they have messed up more than a handful of times over the past year or so and the management clearly has not implemented any changes, they do not apologize still, and they certainly do not try to rectify any wrong doings. I mean, at least TRY to problem solve. Like offer us a replacement meal in the future (and follow through for once), or offer a future desert/appetizer... but because I am NOT interested in freebies- just suck it up and apologize (because you are the manager at a resteraunt- your skin needs to be a little thicker than that) and offer to take off the meal that went wrong (no matter the logistics because we all know it can be done- if there is a will there is a way!!!). I hate to be the one to tell Applebee's staff this... but... us customers are the reason your doors are open and you have a paycheck. If no one comes to your establishment and they tell their friends not to go because you suck... who then tell their friends you are awful... who Yelp about how you deserve a NEGATIVE 3 STAR RATING... eventually doors will start closing, investors will get all upset and go elsewhere, and then another mediocre neighborhood grill will take your place. If you don't want that to happen: change your ways. My advice to Yelpers: Gilbert has some pretty awesome places to eat- please give your money to the places that deserve your time and money- and DO NOT eat here. Whatever excuse you are thinking in your head about why Applebee's is still okay- you are only fooling yourself. This place is leagues below other nearby venues. The end. Now I am going to go feed my cold, tiny, soggy chicken tenders to my dog if you don't mind. Oh wait.

34,Calvin L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,,1.0,2017-07-07,"I ate here late evening on April 20th and had a steak. I ended up getting food poisioning from eating here. My daughter was born on April 22nd early in the morning and I spent the whole time doing the two affects food poisoning have on you in the delivery room. The nurse ended up having to nurture to my pregnant girlfriend and I at the same time. Unfortunately I was unable to enjoy the true experience, of the birth of my daughter, due to me being sick from a steak I ate here. I can honestly say I would never step foot in this Applebee's or any other after that. In addition to that it was by far not the best ""service"" I've received at a resturant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

24,Kemlyn B.,"Glendale, AZ",411,510,1842.0,2.0,2017-08-19,"Poor customer service and food presentation lacking in attention to details. Our family headed to Applebee's near the Mesa Gateway Airport. We always love the Wonton Tacos which drew us here.  It started out well enough. Casey, our server was pleasant and service was customary then. We ordered one entree and 5 appetizers. My daughters split the macaroni and cheese with bacon and honey chicken. They enjoyed it.  Two of our three Wonton Tacos were not finished well. They usually  top the slaw on the tacos. Two of the tacos did not have slaw in it. Another problem with detail was the spinach artichoke dip. The kitchen had left a fairly large woody piece of artichoke in the dip. When Casey came to check on us, she asked, ""How's everything?"" When I asked that she provide feedback to the chef that the tacos were not dressed correctly and there was a large chunk of woody artichoke in my dip. She scoffed at me and rolled her eyes dismissively. ""Okay."" she said and walked off.  Training. I know that she was probably trained by management to ask customers how everything was going, but if servers are not interested in feedback then should at least pretend to be pleasant. Also, if you don't want feedback, don't ask the servers to ask customers how things are going. We left the restaurant disappointed with the service. I don't think we will be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

20,Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",70,384,751.0,3.0,2017-12-12,"It's been some time since we've been to an Applebee's. Decided to go-as they'd sent me a Birthday Special. A BOGO deal. Came in Saturday evening 12/ 9 and sat at the bar. Andrew was our server & bartender. Very pleasant & accommodating. I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt after seeing many of the negative reviews. I think some are honest and a few others not so much!  I can say we had issues with utensil cleanliness. Prior to our meal we had to asked for another set of forks. Wings came out not as requested, kitchen error and it was resolved in a very professional manner. Those were tasty! Double Crunch, never a bad thing when it comes to crispy chicken & sauce! Ordered the Sirloin Steaks (Butchers Reserve). *Keep in mind for later * that again it's suppose to be the ""Buy one, get one : of equal or lesser value FREE""! Steak Meals were $18.99 each. We ordered 1 medium and the other medium rare. Medium rare my husband felt was over cooked. However, it was a 12 oz ""uneven"" butcher cut, so the thicker piece was medium rare and thinner piece was medium well. My cut was more balanced and cook perfectly. Can order two sides. Both of us had the garlic green beans which are good. I had the baked potato and was asked if I wanted it loaded. ""Sure""! It's $2.99 additional for adding bacon & green onion. When it arrived it had 3 very small pieces of bacon and no green onion? *See Pic* I requested a side of both: since I was paying for it! That request was met with no complaints. My husband had the garlic mashed potatoes & they were good. Both meals we just ok. My son came in a little later with his girlfriend, so we added the sampler platter to our bill that they shared. $13.99 Drinks were pricey $8.50 for vodka tonics (grey goose) NOT a double! LOL Beers weren't at Happy Hour Price even with getting there at just before 6PM. The bartender made reference to that when he served us our first set of drinks. At the end of service when we presented the coupon, the bartender took off the sampler platter? They didn't read their own fine print nor honor the coupon the way it was supposed to be offered. I told my husband it should have been one of our steak meals comp'ed?! He wasn't going to bring it up after the charge had gone through. We still paid over $100!  Applebee's has really deteriorated over the years. From management to staff it just is average in my opinion. A fast food chain that use to be very successful , but over the years has declined. I don't think we will be back anytime soon to dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
