The chips are always stale, it's dirty, and the food feels like they been left under heat lamps for hours before they actually bring it out to you. I need to remind myself this place isn't going to get any better. I always hope for the best and wish it was the same as it was when they first open.  The food taste ok if you're REALLY hungry. If not it's just feel like you overpay for something you can probably pick up in the frozen entree at your local supermarket.

2,Eric S.,"Arabi, LA",29,173,74.0,2.0,2012-06-11,"Have had better at other places, a typical low grade chain restaurant. Normally i don't like to go to big chain restaurants because of the lack of individual personality. I went here for a Charitable Animals rights for life event where they got 20% of any flier brought it. Seating didn't take long, but on the way to the table you could smell a musky smell, like wet carpet but i blew it off. Our waitress was very nice and pleasing we got our drinks fast. We split the trio between 5 people, and i wish it was bigger i got a bite of each thing just enough to make me even more hungry for my main meal. I ordered the Shrimp and Steak under 500 cal meal w/ Broccoli n potatoes, Nearly everyone at the table ordered the same. We waited the normal time for our food to start arriving, everyone got there food except one. One persons food was little cold, other sauce was cold, my food was ok, but my steak had a odd texture like if it was over processed. we were nearly done our meals by the time the last persons food came out, and even then it wasn't fully heated. Ow everyone ordered med rare steaks and we all got medium to med well. I know i wont go back to this place unless its another Charity event. The staff is very nice and pleasing but that place needs a good cleaning and kitchen staff needs a refresher course on cooking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=40,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002

16,Elise R.,"Austin, TX",101,13,3.0,1.0,2012-12-23,"My boyfriend and I were in a weakened state after braving Toys R Us 3 days before Christmas. After some shopping at Barnes and Noble, we decided on eating at Applebee's because we wouldn't have to repark the car in order to eat there. Perhaps our fatigue can be blamed for the oversight of deciding to eat at Applebee's; our standards for dining were certainly lower than normal that night. As long as we could get something to eat relatively quickly, that's all we were expecting. Alas, we would be served no food that night at Applebee's... We were seated quickly, but our waitress took somewhere from 3 to 5 minutes to come take our drink order. My minimum requirement at a restaurant is that a waiter or waitress at least acknowledge me within the first 1 to 2 minutes, even if they can't take my drink order right away. When the waitress finally made it to our table, I ordered a water and a Maker's and Coke. My boyfriend ordered the same. The waitress asked if Pepsi would be okay, which I was fine with. My boyfriend changed his order to Kettle One and Sprite (Sierra Mist, actually, but whatevs.) The waitress came back to our table with huge 32 oz. glasses of soda and water. My boyfriend asked if the sodas had alcohol in them, and the waitress looked really confused. We had to explain that we were trying to order cocktails, so she took the sodas back and went to retrieve our liquor. This was the point where my boyfriend and I realized that things were not going to go as planned. After a few minutes the waitress came back and told my bf that they didn't have Kettle One, and would Amaretto be okay. I asked her if she was referring to some kind of Amaretto vodka, and she said yes. I was skeptical, and my bf was just confused, so I intervened and asked her for Grey Goose instead. Things were going downhill fast. The waitress came back with our drinks, which were again in huge 32 oz. cups. Considering the fact that Applebee's has an actual bar with martini glasses and wine glasses, we found it odd that they didn't have small cocktail glasses. My drink was incredibly strong  and my bf's was watered down and weak. Go figure. Oh well, we were hungry, so I ordered a hamburger and bf ordered a steak. A few minutes later the waitress came back to tell me they had run out of hamburger buns, and would I mind my burger on texas toast? I was like, no I don't want my burger on toast, and asked to order something else. But by then my bf had lost his patience and we just cancelled our food order and paid for the drinks and left.  The only upside to the experience was getting go-cups for our cocktails and walking around Lakeside Mall with them. It made the rest of our Christmas shopping way more bearable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=20,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000004
3,Trent T.,"Kenner, LA",0,4,,1.0,2013-01-15,"My wife and I ate here with our 2yr old for dinner.  I ordered a Burger, my wife ordered a steak and our 2yr old had mac and cheese with chicken.  When we were seated the table was still dirty and the hostess just tried to cover the crumbs with the menu from what it seemed. I had to ask her to wipe the table for us.  We ordered and asked for our sons food to come out first.  It did, and the spoon they gave him was dirty.  We asked the server for another spoon and she brought  us plastic-ware which was nice... maybe she was thinking all the silverware would be dirty? (I'm glad she took the extra step to bring us something she knew would be clean.)  My burger was pretty good (a little on the small side but taste was OK.) As for my side dish of broccoli... a few bites in and I see a long hair... We asked for the manager and she took off my wife's meal as she did not eat much before losing her appetite from seeing the hair.  After explaining all of our issues to the manager she looked like it was a normal everyday thing.  The only positive thing I can say about this place was the server.. I don't remember her name for sure, but I think it was Jessica if I had to take a stab at it.  She did everything she could to correct the issues and was very sorry about everything.  Will not be back...

I read every review of this restaurant and noticed that everyone said it sucked.  They are all correct in their assessment of this place.  What is even worse is that I'm sure the upper management and owners at this ""establishment"" read these complaints and choose not to do anything to correct them.  Not only should the restaurant manager be fired, the upper management should be also for allowing this to degenerate like this.  I hadn't eaten in a place this bad since Juarez, Mexico many years ago.  No, wait a minute...I think Juarez was better, and they actually put liquor in their drinks.  Amazing. To sum this complaint up, as long as there are low-standard expecting people eating here, it will remain in business.  My god, what do they eat at home to think that this place is "" really good""?  SHAME ON APPLEBEES...NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!!!!!  Amazing!

They were covered in mozzarella cheese and served in marinara sauce. The bone in wings were also delicious. I had them with the sweet Asian chili sauce. The green bean fries are always a crowd pleaser. Fried green beans are yummy. These were kinda salty though. My wife loves the wonton tacos. She gets them every time. The boneless wings were your typical fried chicken bites covered in bbq sauce. I never understood the concept of boneless wings. Call it what it really is: fried chicken bites.

I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because they completely met my expectations. When you go there, you know you aren't going to get a dynamite meal with awesome service. It's a family-friendly chain restaurant with fair prices. You get what you pay for. I have personally never had a single meal from any Applebee's that I didn't like/wouldn't eat. Okay, except a few years ago I vomited after eating that bourbon street chicken, but I think I had a stomach virus. I find their BBQ boneless wings great, the whole appetizer sampler is out of this world, and that fiesta chicken is also pretty tasty. I have recently started doing WeightWatchers and the good thing about most chain restaurants is that it is easy to find the nutrition information including the WW points. Applebee's has some pretty friendly WW meals which is what I got when I came to this location last (about 3 weeks ago). I ordered the Thai shrimp salad and my grandma ordered the bruschetta steak which is also on the low calorie menu. I thought both dishes were great! I couldn't believe the WW points for my salad was so low bc it was full of shrimp and the sauce was full of flavor. The mushroom that came with my grandma's steak was so good. She ended up giving it to me bc I kept taking bites. The waitress was a little strange. She tried to be very friendly but overall it felt like she was really rushing us.

35,Wendy G.,"Metairie, LA",1,3,1.0,1.0,2015-10-12,"OK not sure where to even begin it was that bad !!! Decided to go here on a Sunday during a Saints game with my teenage daughter, aunt and uncle. This was a big mistake, they were not crowded but the service and food were about the worse I've ever experienced. First the waitress brought drinks to the table, but not straws took us about 10 minuets to get straws at the table. The waitress then leaves and does not come back to take our order for close to 20 minuets. Asked for Sam Adams beer and she said they did not serve Sam Adams beer when clearly it was on every page of the menu !!! Finally our order was taken we ordered two sets of appetizers, one came out right a way the other came out after the meal got to the table.  Now let's talk about the meal two things ordered were ok. My daughter had pasta and it taste like they added sugar to it, the pasta was so bad she took one bit and could not eat any more, then everyone took a taste and we all agreed that it had a lot of sugar in it. My aunt had a steak it was tuff, stringy and raw. The second appetizer that came to the table had hair in it. We had to send it back. The waitress never asked or came back to fill any one's drink at the table.  When she asked how the food was (she could clearly see) that there were two full dishes of food that had never even been touched. We told her horrible she said oh here's the bill and thanks. WTH ??? My food sucks and all you can say is here's the bill ???? No offer to get a manager or apologize for the poor food quality and service. Then to top it all off she tried to double charge for the appetizers that were send back with hair in it.  I would starve before I went here and wasted my money. I've had better food at a corner store. This is the last time I go to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

I find Applebee's always delivers - it is not haut cuisine but rather tasty food for a fair price. Service was warm and friendly.  I had the Brunch Burger which is large and includes hash browns, bacon, and a fried egg on top of the burger and cheese. Comes with some of the better fries I have eaten.

14,Gavin M.,"Metairie, LA",0,16,,1.0,2016-04-09,"It's like these mega chain dine in restaurants all have to have some type of atmosphere... Applebee's has the atmosphere of the freezer section of Rouses, but with more plastic memorabilia, and copies of classic photos. Strange thing is - I like it. Although it's a sit down type of joint, I get the same strain of diarrhea I get from a McDonald's drive thru. The honey mustard is ON POINT. The free refills on cokes and sprites are top notch. Endless apps. Need I say more? Well I will say more. Bee's, as I like to call it, always delivers on that fake family atmosphere combined with the appeal of a generic sports bar from a sterile sitcom you could have watched between the 70s and 90s. They have a drive thru now, if you want that soft serve bowel movement on the go. If a civil war broke out between Chile's and Bee's I would definitely side with Bee's, even if they use slave labor. Get lost Chile's. Applebee's also has a Barnes and Noble in the parking lot. Can Olive Garden, Chile's, or TGIFridays say that? Never went to the bathroom there, but my bathroom at home is NOICE. Get the boneless ribs or something. Or don't. I really don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=20,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002

44,Hannah S.,"Metairie, LA",0,13,,1.0,2016-10-01,"Picture this: Sunday (September 18), 6:30pm, three coworkers go for dinner. All three of us experience differing levels of displeasure at the service. Joshua Tate was our waiter. He didn't take my drink order until 15min into my experience. Upon taking my order after 25min, he bungled my companions orders and neglected to being me the extra sauce that he assured me TWICE he would. And halfway through eating our meals, he presented our checks--without us asking. We wanted desert. We wanted drinks. I had my foot stepped on several times throughout this ""meal"" and had to track down my waiter several times for water. He took dishes away from the table before being certain that they had been finished. I didn't leave a tip; controversial, I know. But I received service that was beyond incompetent and bordered on rude. Well, to my surprise Joshua added himself a $10.00 tip onto my bill. Upon contacting the store, I spoke with Ian who explained that I could pick up that $10.00 in cash from him that very evening with no receipt. Then I spoke with Eric, who denied that this was of any fault of my server JOSHUA TATE, and would compensate me the $10.00 plus some extra for my inconvenience. That turned out to be an extra $5.00. Nearly 10 (ten) days after the CRIME. I've advised my friends and family, I've posted on Facebook and Twitter, and now I'm posting here: do not give your money to Applebee's establishments PERIOD. They protect their own, regardless of legality or fault. I didn't tip JOSHUA TATE because I felt he provided me a level of service at a dine-in restaurant below that of what I expected at a fast food restaurant. In fact, I've received better service at a fast food restaurant. I wish I could award ZERO stars to this location and to this corporation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

The floors are dirty, the place looks worn and beat down. Tables go forever without being cleaned even on a slow night like tonight. Half the wait staff seems like they worked fast food and landed here without any training. It needs to be closed and totally renovated. Let's just say I will never be back. Avoid at all costs!

If there wasn't the machine on the table for me to pay, I would probably still be sitting there instead of typing this! Not sure what was going on, but I wouldn't risk this again.
