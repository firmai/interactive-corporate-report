R Z.,"Valdosta, GA",0,10,22,5.0,11/21/2017,"I order a chipotle bowl, no chicken/cheese, extra avocado. Vegetarian/vegan options: 1) do all sides such rice, broccoli (1.99 each) 2) get the black bean burger 3) get a regular menu item without meat  4) Get a regular menu item and swap the meat for a black bean patty. I decided to get extra avocado in place of chicken and that worked for me. So my bowl had Mexican rice, black bean and corn salsa, crispy tortilla strips, mixed greens, avocado, dressing. $9.99 Our server was very nice and understanding of our diet restrictions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Frank G.,"Carmel, NY",0,28,,2.0,8/25/2017,Service at the bar was great. However the bacon ranch quesadilla app did not taste fresh.  Baked potato soup was good.  Beers on tap seemed fresh.  Entrees arrived on time and were good.  Overall this chilis is consistent and good enough to come back.  Staff are nice and that's half the battle.  They could get 4 stars or 5 but the apps need to taste fresh. We will be back! Well we went back and they loose a star.  Food is still ok but waiting 20 minutes for a Diet Coke refill just pushed me too far.  We will take a real long break from this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Raphael A.,"Washingtonville, NY",0,76,45,1.0,12/6/2017,"Don't order at this location. They don't read what's coming in and the quality is embarrassing to say the least. One order of smoked chicken wings looks like is close to raw than is to being smoked. The ugly looking buffalo wings was supposed to have the sauce on the side but the genious at the restaurant is too stupid to read what is coming in.  As usually you call the store and nobody cares. We're 20 minutes away and after spend $70 on this crap, I have to go out and buy food. This chilli location sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
C. G.,"Bronx, NY",0,22,8,4.0,8/6/2017,This was my family's first time here at this chilis- I didn't expect much but we were pleasantly surprised. The food was great nice and hot the way I like it- served very quick and our server was a polite lovely young women with a unusual but cute name her smile showed how much she enjoyed taking care of our table & I hope our tip showed our appreciation for great service. Would recommend & would definitely return in the future. This is a keeper Yelpers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Christian L.,"New Paltz, NY",7,154,50,1.0,4/10/2017,"Not a great experience. At all. Charred food, slow service. Strange smells. Staff date each other, flirt rather than wait customers. Total ghetto-dining. It's tailgating at best. Rebel view: -0",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Waldemar G.,"Bronx, NY",1,19,1,5.0,10/1/2017,"So decided to go with Chilis because we were in the area and also had a gift card, best decision! We were served by lauren who wasn't pushy and was super down to earth and easygoing, we had the 2 for 22 and it was really good, would definitely recommend to anyone who is in the area, too bad we are an hour away! Keep up the good work guys",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Ryan Q.,"Kansas City, KS",1,3,,5.0,6/25/2017,"Great experience, serving staff is above average. I had the new chicken with waffle entree for lunch today in the bar area and I found it to be surprisingly delicious. I received refills without even needing to ask, and my server was prompt with our food as well as our drinks. I think people take places like this for granted, but they shouldn't because the service is ten times what you receive at the waterfront. Highly impressed, will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
George M.,"Montgomery, NY",0,8,1,3.0,6/14/2017,"Was seated near the kitchen. The doors were open, and the floor in the kitchen was littered.  The service was ok. The food ok. Didn't have a warm fuzzy feeling walking in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Liz H.,"Marlboro, NY",4,27,21,3.0,3/28/2017,"We had the 3 for $16 and 2 for $14.  The only complaint was that, they could've did a little better with the chicken it wasn't to good and Hubby didn't want to send it back because he didn't want any ""special sauce"" lol. I had ribs and crispy chicken tender which was really good. Our waiter ""Anthony was spectacular"" the drinks was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Corinne R.,"Walden, NY",24,6,9,2.0,2/24/2017,"Very disappointing meal.  It took forever for the food to come. No free chips and salsa while you wait ...I ordered the fajitas ~ paid extra for shrimp that was tasteless and soft ~ and that sizzling plate that lets you smell your food from across the room was barely warm, as was the food on it.  The 3 flour tortillas had hard edges. Glad I paid extra for the rice and beans, because while also barely warm, they had great flavor!  That was the only dollar well spent at Chilis tonight.  Buh~bye Chilis!  Too many better options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Kayli R.,"Newburgh, NY",0,27,,5.0,3/14/2017,"I always have a nice time at this Chilis despite some reviews on here. My food is always good and comes quick, service is pretty much always good as well. I try to avoid weekend nights because of business, but that goes for anywhere. Love the fresh mex bowls and the ribs are also really really tasty. Nice to be able to pay on the Kiosk too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Maria G.,"Shirley, NY",8,12,25,1.0,2/13/2016,Very disappointed.  Very nice place If you have allergies I won't recommend anyone going there.  They dont take allergies seriously. Ordered a very simple meal they got it wrong 4x ended up not eating at all :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Cynthia F.,"Newburgh, NY",5,1,,1.0,11/8/2016,I have been a patron of this Chili's forever..... and for the past few months the service has been non existent...actually walked out twice due to the slow...inattentive service during the afternoon hours.  Went 12 ish.....4ish..... sparsely staffed. Only orders to go were being completed.  Today my boyfriend went and received the same poor service...walked out....again. Not going back. COME ON CHILI'S you used to be so good.....?????? What's up????,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449,3.0,10/7/2014,Chilis in Newburgh is in a good location it is off the main drag. But parking is horrible the parking lot is too small for the amount of restaurants they have located on the lot.  I have eaten here inside 2 times the first time was when it first opened and it was very good. The second time we waited about 1hr for our food and when we grabbed the waitress she checked with the kitchen and they dident have our order. We asked for a manager he took our order and they comped us our food for free. The food was good nothing special and not worth 2 hrs total.  I have eaten at the carside to go 5 times and it is really nice that you can place a order online and then I can pick it up on the way back from a flight. I haven't had a bad car side to go meal here. When I have picked the food up the staff is really friendly. When I have someone else pick my food up for me they tell me the staff is friendly and accommodating.  I ordered carside to go tonight and everything was fine until I got home and I was missing a burger from my order I ordered $60 worth of food. I had to call the chilis and I spoke with the manager and she was very nice and asked if I would like them to make a new burger for pick up. I laughed inside because the reason I ordered online was to pick up dinner on the way home and make dinner easy. So she took the amount off of my order she was extremely apologetic about the error. I took a picture of the receipt. Everything was ether circled or crossed off but the burger. I just thought it was funny. so the person who had the burger missed out.  I would prob have the person picking up the order double check next time just to make sure. I would order the carside to go again after a long flight or something. I don't know if I would go here with my friends. Although I do know one of my friends is a regular here because he works close by.  PROS: -Carside to go is easy -friendly staff   CONS: -parking lot is too small  - forgot to place entire order,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Brandon R.,"Clayton, CA",393,12,1,2.0,4/24/2016,"Have eaten at chili's 3 times in the last month because I had a gift card with no problem. Yesterday at around 4 pm my table got chips and salsa, fried asparagus and I got the sirloin with avocado on top. This morning at 2 am I felt very sick and vomited multiple times over the next few hours and got to see the salsa again. Would not recommend going here for a few weeks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Neal F.,"New Windsor, NY",0,8,3,3.0,7/17/2015,Typical Chili's - clean and friendly.   Family Friendly and not a long wait even on a Friday night. Tip- Use the NoWait app and get seated fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Kd H.,"Lawton, OK",8,15,7,1.0,12/11/2015,Wish I could give 0 stars. Literally just waited 20 minutes and watched 3 new tables get waited on seated after us by different waitresses in the same cluster. Last experience was pretty shotty. Too bad I have Preggo cravings for chilis. Guess I'll have to drive the extra 15 mins to Monroe. Pitiful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Stephen T.,"Farmington, CT",147,366,1193,5.0,4/22/2014,"Was back on a Sunday. The waiter was super friendly, along with another waitress assisting.  Everything was perfect. Service, food, temperature and cleanliness.  I was surprised to see that they added a New Mexican theme to the menus.  Very similar the most Mexican restaurants offering two or three toco/enchiladas. Salad was part of the deal so for $9.89 I feel I will be going to chilis when craving Mexican rather then a lot of local Mexican chains. Look forward to my next Newburgh trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Glenn D.,"Marlboro, NY",11,18,23,5.0,4/13/2015,"When we arrived we were greeted nicely, and we had requested a booth away from the bar, although the other side was closing, we were still accommodated with our request. I ordered the loaded baked potato soup, and the Texas cheese fries. We both started with a bowl of their yummy garlic dill pickles. The soup was awesome, very cheesy and topped with bacon, a delight. The fries were awesome, a great mix of cheese, bacon, jalapeños etc, with a side of yummy ranch sauce for dipping. To wash it down I had the mango sweet iced tea, in which our server suggested for me...fantastic.   She had the southwest burger, with a side of the southwest Mac n cheese, she loved it. She very rarely clears the plate, well, nothing let on that plate! She would recommend it to any burger lover.   For desert she had a cinnamon swirl skillet, and I had some vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, both were fresh and finished this wonderful meal.    I considered a 4 star for the loud kitchen, however, regardless of the type of music it was...I like mine loud too :)   Last but not least, I must give a well deserved compliment to our server, Brianne. This wonderful young lady, with her cool raspy voice, was right on the money. Drinks never ran low, familiar with the items, quick with a smile. Chilis will hopefully hang on to this young lady :)  Walking into any chain restaurant you never know what to expect. Well, this Chilis will not disappoint, I promise. The environment, food and staff make it a great place to enjoy some time with your family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2
Charles M.,"Newburgh, NY",0,121,125,4.0,8/22/2015,Typically same thing. Seated in no time. The service was fast and easy. the at table that computer thing is great.

Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1884,1405,4.0,2/20/2012,"I went to Chili's in Newburgh quite a few times when it just opened...back in 2008 and 2009! I absolutely loved this place...always good food and service. In my opinion this is the best Chili's of the all locations. However I look at other reviews and I noticed one thing. This place USED TO be great.   They got a few nice reviews earlier and now I get an impression that it is  like a hell hole. (Again I went there back in 2008 and 2009,,,haven't been there so long so I cannot speak for how it is now).  I find it very unfortunate....looks like they lost a motivation and good management over time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20
Eric R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,549,401,1.0,4/17/2011,"Before I trash this place, because that's what it was trash let me say that the service was top notch during my visit.  My family and I received really exceptional service from our waitress as she was attentive, helpful and really on top of things. Now the food is another question because it was an utter disaster! Our order of fried cheese (aka, mozzarella sticks) tasted like microwaved frozen food.  My wife ordered the Nacho Cheese appetizer and it was topped with melted cheese and guacamole which had olives that were dried up appearing as if the entire dish sat in the fridge until it was ""heated"".  Appetizers tasted like complete crap (I'm sorry there really is no other way to put it).  Main courses were below average with my youngest kid's mac & cheese that looked really terrible that I didn't let my kids eat the mac & cheese. Based on this experience I will NEVER step foot in any Chili's franchise ever again in my life; not even if it were free!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20
Hank P.,"White Plains, NY",0,7,,1.0,9/3/2015,"Girlfriend orders the Big Mouth Bites to-go after her and a friend are their for lunch. Her friend orders the same meal so she thinks it would be something I would like. After getting it home we find out that they basically didn't include the fries. We call to ask why and the person on the phone asks if we were given 16.5 ounces of fries. !?!?!? Are you kidding me? First, how am I suppose to know what 16.5 ounces of fries looks like. Second, are you really in the back with a scale measuring French fry portions? I can go to Five Guys and order a small fry and can't even finish it since it's so big, but yet Chili's is rationing French fries! The burger was dry and the meal was overall blah! Don't waste you money; I've had better burgers that cost much less than $10!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20
Alex A.,"Atlanta, GA",18,14,,2.0,2/4/2015,"Early this week, I was customer number one for the day. It took 25 minutes to get some tacos and an enchilada after my order was taken.  Today, I came in and was seated at a table and waited 15 minutes for anyone to take my order before walking out. Lunch time should not have waits like those. I finally went next door to Longhorn.  I will say, earlier in the week, when I was served, the food was good.  Hence the two stars.  It's a shame this place as most Chili's are good in my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20

Mysteros F.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",11,48,7,4.0,4/21/2014,"This review is based on the average of 2 recent visits. The first trip there, we had a really attentive waiter who recommended us great food. Really enjoyed the soft taco and enchiladas.  The dessert,  chocolate molten lava cake was AMAZING. So good we went back again for the same dessert. The second visit, we had to wait quite a bit for the food and everything was squished together on one plate so it got kinda messy. I think I would rate this place a 5 if the experience was consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20

Dehna D.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",12,63,,1.0,3/11/2012,"Just has an awful experience at this Chili's! I suggested this restaurant to my daughter because I had had a great experience at the Chili's in Wappingers and we were going to be in the Newburgh area.  Total mistake! Everything was filthy, even my daughter's straw which had been in a wrapper. The only thing worse than the service was the food, which was inedible. We ate as much of the greasy appetizer (which came out after the meal) as we could and then left. The manager took care of our bill, which is a good thing because we couldn't even eat our meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-newburgh-2?start=20
