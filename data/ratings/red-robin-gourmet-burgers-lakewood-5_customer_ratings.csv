They have those tableside computer things, which is where we had to order our appetizer. Our service was good at the beginning, but it went downhill as we progressed. I ordered a meal with specific requests, and repeated myself multiple times to make sure he got it right. When my meal came out, one of the main ingredients (cheese) was missing. Our server brushed by our table to grab plates and didn't stop to see how things were going. When I finally got someone to stop, they brought out a slice of cheese. There was no offer to remake the dish, which would have been nice because melted cheese would have been better.  Lastly, we decided to order dessert to go, which we had to do through the table side computer thing. We specifically put it ""to go"" which was an option. A different server brought it out on a plate. I told her it was to go, and she took it back to the kitchen. Then she brought the same plate out to me with a to go box, saying ""they don't do take out orders."" Umm, okay. I had to awkwardly put the dessert in the to go box myself which was a pain in the butt because it was messy. The whole experience put a bad taste in my mouth and gave me indigestion for two days.

She was easy on the eyes and very helpful with the whole menu.  I eventually settled on a root beer alcoholic shake, with an appetizer, and a gourmet burger. The food came without too much of a wait. The food was delicious when I took a bite! Everything I asked for was served correctly and it was still hot. The A1 peppercorn burger is my new favorite!  Miranda, who is my new favorite to go to, took care of myself and my girlfriend. She even got us set up on the Red Robin Royalty program. Apparently I'm now eligible for HUGE discounts and freebies.

When I went to this location the burger I got sucked. The patty was a 1/8 lb cruddy costco patty with a bun that disintegrated upon touching. It took them 3 times to fix this burger. They did a great job the second time hiding the cruddy patty with more lettuce, 4 tomatoes, and a bunch of caramelized onions. Finally re manager brought the correct patty out.

20,Josh C.,"Denver, CO",96,38,,4.0,2017-12-04,"Food was great - as usual. But slow...agonizingly slow... On a Thursday eve, not very busy... Initial order took 30 minutes and then tried to order seconds on fries...going on 20 minutes...still don't have them.  Went back a month later and things were much better. They seemed to have address the timing issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
34,Dan B.,"Denver, CO",0,11,2.0,1.0,2017-12-09,"Had a simple two burger to-go order. Called in at 5:35 Saturday Night. Got my order wrong 3 times and took over an hour and a half to get it right. Was 7:20 when I left. Spoke with the manager each time and when they finally get it right he hands me a $10 gift card for ""Next Time"" as if I'd waste mine going back. Should have been a full refund for compensation for ruining my family's dinner and wasting over two hours of my life with driving there and back that I'll never get back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

24,Dave C.,"Denver, CO",27,235,588.0,4.0,2017-12-19,Surprisingly good!  It has been many years since I ate at a Red Robin.  Both the food and service were great.  They had a good menu selection.  Burger was quite good and perfectly cooked.  Really hit the spot and satisfied our lunch.  Will definitely be back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
26,Shannon M.,"Leadville, CO",1,2,2.0,1.0,2017-12-30,Food had bugs in it and hair in menus so gross. It was moving and everything. We couldn't continue eating because all of our burgers had lettuce on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
25,Lauri M.,"Golden, CO",0,3,1.0,2.0,2018-01-04,This was our first time ordering from Red Robin. My veggie burger was under cooked. Sweet potato fries were over cooked. Fried pickles were very salty and over cooked. My husband's burger and fries were under cooked....don't think we will be going back.

We always sit at the bar and get great service, even when the place is full there tends to be a bit of room at the bar. The burger with the fries Jalepenos is down right delicious, so is the bacon guacamole burger. The bottomless fries are a bit unnecessary by for sure appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
