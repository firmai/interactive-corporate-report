Gretchin A.,"Grayslake, IL",92,68,57,4.0,8/14/2016,I really enjoyed my visit to this location. Staff are friendly and its very clean. Had the lunch salad/sandwich combo which was excellent. Went with the  ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN SANDWICH and the THE MEDITERRANEAN salad with blue cheese instead. Salad was a hit and the sandwich was really good as well. also really liked the bread with olive oil and spices they brought out before the food got there. Overall great experience and really good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
Andrew M.,"Palatine, IL",32,208,12,2.0,7/31/2014,"My first trip to a CPK was undoubtedly my last for the foreseeable future. Went here for dinner with the in-laws. I wasn't in the mood for pizza, but I didn't put up a fight (big mistake).  I ordered a wedge salad and club sandwich. The wedge salad was not good despite having Nuesky's bacon on it. I barely finished half of my sandwich because it was horrible. Our service was slow, and the waiter had basically no idea what anything on the menu was or what beers they had on tap.  Overall, I came away incredibly underwhelmed (unimpressed). I will wait until I am in the mood for pizza before I go back again. Yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
Cupcake S.,"Arlington Heights, IL",3,96,1,5.0,11/12/2015,"A review of the take out process... I am impressed with how good the service was here--from calling in my order, to being greeted when I walked in and led to the take out area, and then picking up my food at the take out counter. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. And they even threw in a little extra birthday treat for us.  Our food was good--your standard CPK menu items that we're used to getting! I hadn't been to this CPK in a while, and I'll definitely go back when I'm in the area! The new decor is also nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101,2.0,5/23/2014,"Sorry, CPK... I hope it was an off night, but this location seems to be slipping. Came in last night with my mom for a quick bite.  Our server did come right away to offer drinks (my mom was in the bathroom) so I ordered for both of us.  As soon as my mom sat down, the server was asking us if we wanted appetizers.  We of course, asked for a minute, which turned into nearly 10.  I get that our server was most likely triple-sat, so it's not entirely her fault, but, it seems the restaurant on whole needs a better seating system. Mom ordered a full California Cobb salad, and I ordered a pepperoni pizza on the ""crispy thin"" pizza crust instead of the original. Our server did not bring our food.  I could not tell if it was a manager or food runner that made the drop.  It was obvious that my mom was given a half portion salad rather than the full.  When I asked about it, the person who dropped the food picked it up, and went to talk to the server.  Why do you need to talk to the server?  Just take the salad back to the kitchen and have it re-made. The server and food runner/possible manager interaction took awhile, because our server was with another table and the server/food runner had to wait, and then the runner came back, asked if there was anything ""special he needs to know"" about the salad before having it remade.  Then, it took another 10 minutes to remake.   My mom of course made me eat while my food was hot.  Well, the crust on my pizza was definitely not ""thin and crispy.""  The edges were, but the middle was limp, like, worse than New York style limp. I was pretty shocked by the length of time it took for mom's new salad, to come out, and no apology from anyone.  I'd like to say I'll just go back and stick with my standby, the pear gorgonzola, but that's made on the thin crust too, and definitely not good soggy. To top it off, I had a queasy yicky feeling in my stomach the rest of the night.  No bueno.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
Ron T.,"Barrington, IL",0,10,,3.0,4/15/2016,"The service here is great. The food can be very good. I also like their recent re-model. But I have to say, they made some changes to their menu a couple of years ago - changing their bread, modifying their pizza crusts - that noticeably lowered their food quality. This makes you have to pick and choose to find something good. The pizza crust is often flat and chewy. The bread is tasteless. Go with a salad, pasta, or entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
Brittany O.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,7,5.0,6/19/2016,Came in on a Friday and left with a full tummy. My server was Moses and he was very attentive. He also was quite pleasent and friendly.

Marie S.,"McHenry, IL",0,2,,2.0,3/11/2017,"I am NEVER one to complain since I am a manager in the customer service industry but the service we received tonight was quite poor. After being placed on the waiting list, which was expected we were skipped over numerous times. Mind you we were a party of two, the easiest of parties to place. When we finally decided to ask when we would be seated  we were told we would be the next seated, instead of apologizing to the customer they had just called and asking them to wait. We then overheard the hostesses say that they weren't in charge of the list and they weren't the one who skipped over us (well obviously one of you did while you were talking about your social lives). By the time we were seated we were a bit upset but thought ""okay we're at least sitting and we can get some good food"". Granted the rest of the service was okay, we got our food quickly, it was delivered by the assistant general manager, and our server was nice enough even though we barely saw him because it was a bit busy. However the front of the house really sets the tone for the rest of the experience and as someone who frequents this location I was just very disappointed with their organization and their lack of ownership of the mistake they made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20

The new decor looks great however...although it was crowded, we sat at the bar to order carry out and a couple glasses of wine. The poor bartender was totally overwhelmed running back and forth. The bar was full of dirty glasses, the counter top was a mess, unwiped, The manager kept walking by and never made eye contact or stopped to ask if we needed something. I asked the bartender to wipe our countertop and he got a bit defensive. I said he looked overwhelmed and doesn't he have any support - his reply was 'never!"" We gave up after a long wait and went to another restaurant in the mall - were served immediately and the staff was attentive and super calm. I don't want to be in an atmosphere where I pick up on the wait staff's stress. I want to go out to get away from that.

Steve J.,"Lake Zurich, IL",30,48,,4.0,3/29/2015,"Went there yesterday with my wife.  We've probably been there a half dozen times in the last 18 months.  For us, it is always consistent.  They have a great variety and we tend to go for the salads and appetizers vs. the pizzas.   Service is always consistent... not bad, not stellar (although our server yesterday was great).  But, this is CPK... you will get a lot of families and some with screaming babies.  Don't expect a quiet ambiance with 4-star service (which I think some of the reviewers were expecting).   That said, we will be back many times in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20
May K.,"Palatine, IL",12,131,43,4.0,5/18/2014,"I haven't been here for many years because no one wants to go with me. My old favorite used to be the tri color pizza salad. Awesome! Plus when I think of CPK, I think pizza and I'm trying to stay away from carbs. Anyway, someone gave me a $50 gift card and it was sitting in my wallet since Christmas. The number one naysayer was not with me, so I forced the kids to join me just to get rid of that gift card. I know, such bad parenting.  I had to try their frozen strawberry premium margarita. I forgot to ask them to upgrade the tequila, but I didn't need to. This drinks were served top shelf as a norm. That's pretty cool! I loved it, it gave an immediate impact and so yummy, score score, score! I had the salad something with chicken and it was really good. The 3 kids each had a nice looking, completely devoured kids meal (pizza, noodles and chicken strips). The waiter was attentive and friendly. In my slightly altered state (2 of those knock out margaritas, should've stopped at 1), I left my credit card and unsigned receipt there. The nice bus boy ran to catch me and all was good in my world again.  Went shopping in the mall afterwards. Fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20

It's her family of four plus me so we decided on where her kids wanted to go. Because of my last experience at the CPK in Schaumburg, I wasn't excited. After tonight, I've had another change of heart.  I ordered the Asparagus + Spinach Spaghettini. A plate of angel hair pasta, full of fresh asparagus, spinach, house made checca sauce and Parmesan. Adding to the dish your choice of grilled chicken breast, shrimp or sautéed salmon is optional.   Besides the after taste and lingering sense of bad breath even after Listerine and brushing...

Katrina D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",50,154,104,4.0,5/15/2013,"I ate at CPK yesterday and everything was great.  It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We were still seated right away and were able to sit outside when we requested.  I had a coupon for a free spinach and artichoke dip because I receive their e-mails, which is basically why we went. What we got: - Five Cheese and Tomato pizza on honey wheat crust - Original BBQ Chicken pizza on honey wheat crust - Spinach and artichoke dip There were no issues using my coupon and everything was delicious.  We had good service (nothing super exceptional) and everything happened in a timely manner.  Our drinks came out, followed shortly by our appetizer.  We weren't quite done with our dip when our pizzas arrived, which was fine because it gave them a little time to cool before we bit in. I didn't get it this trip, but I love their Sedona Tortilla Soup.  If you haven't tried it yet, you really must! Tip:  Sign up for their e-mail and add their Pizza Dough app and start receiving free things!  I think you get a discount on your meal just for signing up and they'll periodically send you deals like the free spinach and artichoke dip.   This location is also great.  You can walk around when you're done eating and hit a few shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=20

A personal favorite of mine is the margherita pizza, with extra basil, and its quality has remained consistent over the years. Their sandwiches are great, too.  One of my favorite things at CPK is their peach iced tea. I always order it at places that serve it, and I've noticed that at CPK it is better by far than anywhere else.

Deb V.,"Nashville, TN",1,35,,5.0,12/1/2008,"I love this place when I get the munchies.  I've been eating at this location since it first opened up in 2003 (I think).   I remember one of the old managers from a few years ago BEGGED me to work for them, every time I came in to eat.  That was friggin' hilarious.  I love the California Club Pizza neopolitan style and the tiramisu.  I always get their strawberry smoothie.  Service is good, depending who ya get, I usually have a good experience every time...always refilling and asking if things are good.   Managers come up and talk to you to see how things are.  Food comes quick.  Wait sucks on a Friday & Saturday night, but that's everywhere....even though they get so busy, I still get good service. Maybe it's just my luck? One thing I hated is when I saw my waitress in the bathroom come out of a stall after flushing the ""john"" and she didn't even wash her hands. When I came back to my table, I told my parents just so they could get a good laugh..turns out they didn't even find it funny (oops).  My dad told the manager and the manager told the waitress to go home...OOPS!  My bad.  I've done catering with them pretty much every New Years and the food is ready so quickly....I'd call maybe 2 hours ahead for about $300- $500 worth of food....the order is always right every time.  They're so helpful and they'd help me bring the food to my car even though it's like 20 degrees outside. I like this place and the people are a lot nicer than the ones in the Schaumburg location...although...I think Schaumburg cooks just a bit better :) and the new Nashville location can't cook for the life of anyone. ha. *****  I love that they have outdoor seating in this location!!! So nice to have a good friend and a glass of wine out on the porch on a nice day :)   I get that it's a pain in the a$$ to wait on people at the outdoor seating, but servers are still nice and attentive. ***** like the music- even ranges to Contemporary Christian- my fave!  Heard my favorite song on there:  Josh Wilson ""Before the Morning""....had no idea they wouldn't be opposed to playing christian music....ain't that sweet. amen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=60

They did so we went up to the counter. Jeff was great and the kids had a blast trying to stretch and toss their dough. He then had the pizzas prepared as they wanted them and gave them to the kids for FREE. Meanwhile we went back to our seats and soon the kids had their pizzas. Then the order we placed came as well.

Sue D.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,4,,1.0,2/17/2016,"The last time I visited this specific restaurant, my husband and I were told the bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock.  So . . . we ordered a more expensive bottle.  When we were given the bill, the price of the bottle of wine was MORE than what the menu listed.  We called the waitress over and she wasn't too willing to help us out at all.  Then we asked for the manager who confessed ""You must have gotten an old menu; we just had new menus printed."" She did honor the price quoted on the menu after our discussion, but I was curious.  On our way out, I checked other menus laying in a pile by the entrance.  There were A LOT of ""old"" menus (with ""old"" prices) . . . I thought that was very suspicious -- tricking people to buy something and then hoping they don't notice the upcharge on the bill.  I wrote their corporate office and told them the story . . . never heard from them.  So . . . when friends of mine decided to get together for dinner this past week, I was a little hesitant.  But I went any way, not wanting to sound negative about things. The restaurant had been remodeled since I was there last and it was nice enough.  But our table of 6 was just behind the hostess station and it was cold every time the front door was opened.  We managed.  Both me and a friend ordered coffee - the others ordered alcohol.  Our coffee was lukewarm, at best.  We attempted to get the attention of our waiter and finally succeeded to let him know the problem.  It took 25 minutes to get a new cup of hot coffee.  Luckily, it was hot.  Then the rest of our party ordered pizzas and salads to ""share"".  I was the only one to order a garlic chicken dinner.  Thank goodness I ordered on my own.  I had their Roasted Vegetable salad way back when and almost ordered it . . . back in the day, it was good.  OMG!  If you were accustomed to the ""old"" meals - be prepared to see what they are doing now.  The Roasted Vegetable salad consisted of a bowl of lettuce with a small mound of vegetables on top.  Same with the BBQ Chicken Salad -- lots of ""filler"" and a small amount of chicken on top.  Everyone was ""polite"" and didn't say anything . . . but I know inside they were very surprised.  Not much of a meal for them.  Also, when a waiter hears that a group of people are going to ""share"" food, you would THINK the waiter would have the hindsight to bring extra plates.  No.  Everyone (except me) had to share their pizza and salad on a small bread plate.  I would have requested plates, but I had my own garlic chicken meal in front of me, so I kept quiet. Never ONCE did the waiter check on us throughout our entire meal.  We were asking other waiters and waitresses for refills on our coffee - this guy was OBLIVIOUS!  Luckily, I had an old gift card that needed to be used with $11 still remaining on it.  I used it that night and plan to never return to this restaurant again.  I'm tired of service that doesn't even compare to the area restaurants.  Plus, they are totally scrimping on the food they used to serve.  Maybe it is because they need to ""pay"" for the remodel job?  Who knows, but I'm moving on to other restaurants who value their customers.   I was with the Administrative Assistant of a local corporate headquarters.  She pulled another waitress aside and asked to talk to a manager.  She had ordered catered food to the office recently and was extremely disappointed, not to mention deeply embarrassed, as people from around the world were in for a meeting.  She told the manager that she had called the restaurant afterward to advise them of the problems and had NOT received a return phone call.  Ironically, she was with our group that evening for our dinner and thought she should take advantage of the opportunity to talk to someone.  The manager was very apologetic, listened to her story and assured her she would receive a phone call the next day.  I guess their catering service needs improvement as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=40
Sethu M.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,23,22,1.0,11/24/2014,"I have had multiple disappointments from this location of cpk particularly with management n servers. We did a call ahead for a large party an hour before arriving because they don't do reservations. when we arrived they said all members of our party needed to be present to get a table. The restaurant was pretty empty and the real problem was that they didn't have a server available for us. After waiting for half an hour we finally got the table...again the restaurant was pretty empty and there was no one else waiting for a table.  The server didn't know the difference between regular and thin crust so I had to explain to her that i wanted a particular thin crust pizza but on a regular crust instead. She still got one of the pizza wrong.  Half of the spoons seemed like they were not washed and still had brownish merky water on them. The new spoons we asked for were also dirty.  All the items arrived separately to the table. we were a group of 14. so when we got a pizza only six people or so would get a slice and the rest would just look on. that one slice didn't last long and after few minutes those people would also be sitting idle waiting for the next item to arrive. we had ordered several pizzas, pastas etc but it seemed like we had ordered nothing because there was never food left on the table.  all in all this was my third bad experience at this cpk and I will not be returning.

Katie M.,"Oak Park, IL",28,95,17,2.0,12/18/2012,"Good service and decent chain restaurant type food (aka: nothing special but nothing to complain about).  The servings are huge.  Unless you haven't eaten in 3 days, I suggest taking advantage of their half order option.   Who the heck was the architect/decorator for this restaurant though?  My sister and I were seated in a 2 person booth...which was separated from a 4 person booth by a small 5 inch wide wall that was below my shoulder level.  I was so close to my dining neighbors that I felt as though I should introduce myself to them before starting my meal...or maybe I feared that they might casually reach out at any point for a forkful of my food.  The restaurant seating feels like an office cube farm.      Please CPK, put some faux plants on those low walls so I don't feel like I'm intruding on my neighbor's dinner & conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=40
Gabby G.,"Harwood Heights, IL",0,13,,2.0,5/3/2015,This was my second time at the restaurant. Nothing against the service or the location. The food is just an unfortunate attempt to make a tasty pizza. I'm talking about the 'California Club'. You might as well remove it from your menu because it's the tasteless and most pathetic food I've had in a looooong time!!!   This should NOT be served in a pizza restaurant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=40

It took three tries to get our drink order right, and the food took an unusually long time based on the number of restaurant patrons.  My husband always orders his salad without certain ingredients due to dietary restrictions, but it came with the items he requested be left off. They were nice & remade the salad fairly quickly.

We had to ask multiple times for bread, water and even silverware......I told the waitress I would like a refill 15 min into our visit (I drink fast :)) but she didn't return. Our food was brought out by a different server so I told her that I would like a refill..... Said she would get it but still didn't come. A third server finally came by the end of our meal and said our waitress had to leave so he said he would get me the refill but we were already finished with our meal.......despite the excessive wait time for EVERYTHING not even my strawberry mango cooler refill was comped, instead he offered a to go cup.

Jen H.,"River Grove, IL",9,105,12,3.0,8/4/2012,"The Baja chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, but a bit pricey for what you get, which can also be said about almost everything else here. I had the new strawberry shortcake, which I didn't care for. The pastry was very dense and not very sweet.. more like a biscuit, and it was overpriced. The tiramisu was even pricier and tasted a bit.. different. It is smothered in a sort of liquid cream, which was tastey, but it was just a bit too much, you couldn't really taste anything else. After asking our waiter for a pasta recommendation, I had the Broccoli Sun-Dried Tomato Fusilli. It was mostly plain noodles, no sauce, and very little of the other tastey ingredients.

John K.,"Lake Zurich, IL",64,8,4,3.0,7/9/2011,"Ate here last night (Friday) at 6:30pm and there was no wait for a seat at the bar. I sat down ordered a drink that the bartender just happened to be making (a strawberry mojito) and my appetizer, their new bang bang shrimp.  The strawberry mojito had a nice presentation and tasted fine, but was pretty weak and needed more lime. The strawberries in it I think dissipated the flavors to the point to where I couldn't taste much else. The bang bang shrimp were good but not very spicy at all. They tasted sweet more than anything else. They came on a bed of fried white noodles I believe which were light and crispy and I loved them with the shrimp. You also got a decent amount of protein for the price. (8-9 dollars) I then ordered one of their new pizzas, the habanero carnitas pizza. The pizza was alright. The salsa that came on the side (which I was thankful that it came on the side) was pretty spicy, and might ruin the pizza for the average person. I didn't use it all and I like spicy things. The pizza itself didn't have much flavor, the main thing I tasted was the sweet crust. The carnitas was a little dry, and not flavorful enough to stand out on the pizza. I finished with a slice of their red velvet cake. Very good. Nice presentation on a black plate. Sweet but not too sweet, and not too much frosting. You can definitely taste the vanilla bean, and you can see it in the frosting as well. Overall a pretty decent place, this visit was 3 stars, it can be 4 if you order the right things. This time though most of the flavors just didn't come out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park?start=40

It was delish and big enough to bring home for lunch the next day. Father in law ordered the Greek Pizza... it looked and smelled wonderful. Kids menu is basically a large coloring and activity book to keep the kids busy. My son had a kids cheese pizza and my daughter had the mac n cheese. The kids pizza was nothing special but for a 7 year old, it was awesome. I tried my daughters mac n cheese and it was really really good.  The desserts were tasty as well.

Heather N.,"Barrington, IL",148,89,143,3.0,1/15/2017,"The one thing I love about this place is the avocado club egg roll appetizer. They're so good and served with a regular ranch and a spicy ranch; we prefer the spicy ranch.  We were seated right away but didn't get a waiter for about 10 minutes, the place wasn't super crowded. We split the chicken club pizza which was just okay. I felt like I was eating a salad over some crust? The description says the salad is tossed in a lemon vinaigrette and our waiter said that's the ""sauce"" for the pizza, but it was just missing the sauce element as the pizza was plain and missing that something extra. We ended up using the left over ranch from our appetizer for our pizza.  Our waiter Brian was friendly. Our lunch was cheap too, $30 exactly . Would come back again for maybe two orders of the egg rolls next time instead of a pizza :p",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-deer-park

However, they have THE WORST service out of any restaurant I've ever been to. I don't know why they can't seem to get it together. Literally ever single visit my order is wrong. And it's not a complicated order either. Management is usually good about being apologetic and getting it corrected, but it's very annoying that they can NEVER just get it right the first time. Neither the waiters nor the kitchen staff seem to be able to follow through with simple requests, and when things are wrong they don't own up to their mistakes or even seem to care.
