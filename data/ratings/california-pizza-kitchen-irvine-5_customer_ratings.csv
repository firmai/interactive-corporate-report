168,Alex B.,"San Diego, CA",27,8,7.0,5.0,2015-08-24,"Went to lunch with some friends at the new CPK today and it was a completely different experience than any other CPK I have been in. The restaurant was completely redesigned inside and out...fresh vibes, bright aesthetic and a much more modern floor plan and layout. A really great new impression on the CPK brand. The food was great and the service was quick for a busy lunch rush. This was their pre-grand opening... but the service seemed to be pretty dialed in. We shared the Cobb salad, and split the Hawaiian and BBQ chicken pizzas. The Pizza came out piping hot from the oven and was delicious. I think our office lunch bunch will need to add this into our rotation!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=120,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

127,Jonesy R.,"Irvine, CA",1,19,,5.0,2015-08-26,"We had what could have been a deal-breaking bad experience tonight - CPK's online ordering system glitched and deleted our order. This happened well past our usual dinnertime with a hungry family - on a school night, no less. When I tried to order by phone, I found out I was starting over, which set my order back 40 minutes. I wrote it off to a first day snafu for this new location, which we knew would be very busy. But what a surprise... when our dinner was brought to us curbside, a super apologetic employee told us that one of our meals plus an appetizer were comped. Very gracious and much appreciated! While we usually prefer to dine in, it was nice to avoid the crowds and yet still receive a meal just as great as if we had eaten there. Welcome to the neighborhood, CPK. See you again in a few days, I'm sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=160,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006
41,Bella B.,"Cerritos, CA",214,230,1042.0,5.0,2015-08-27,"I came here on grand opening night, Wednesday August 26, 2015. The restaurant was packed and bustling and there was simultaneously a private Yelp event going on. This could have been disastrous, but it wasn't! Service from each and every server I encountered was fantastic. I used to be in restaurant management, so I a bit skeptical about how successful 2 major events would be in one night, but I was blown away. More than successful! Each cocktail I had was delicious and each entrée I tried was fabulous.  If you want a creative drink, you have to try the California Roots. It's made with fresh avocado and rimmed with fennel salt. Not too sweet and quite delicious. This might well become my new favorite cocktail. The blood orange sangria was also very good, but it's on the sweeter side. It would be a perfect drink for a novice.  Now, let's move onto the Fire-grilled ribeye. I had my doubts about a pizza focused restaurant making good ribeye. Well, let me say, I was completely wrong. Order it medium rare. There's also herb butter melting on top when it's served. Gorgonzola butter would have given me a heart attack! The ribeye was so good. This is definitely be my new go to dish here. The salted caramel pudding for dessert was also good. Crumbly bits at the bottom. There wasn't am overpowering caramel flavor. It was a nice, mild dessert perfect to share, or even for kids.  The hustle and bustle made me miss the industry. I was lucky enough to chat with the regional territory manager and a few PR ladies. Everyone was friendly and informative. Way to go CPK, I was impressed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=60,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188
120,Gloria G.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,,5.0,2015-08-27,"We went to CPK last night- on opening night and a school night none the less. We signed in and were told waiting was and 1hr. Ok no problem it was expected. An hour later we checked in and kept being told by the girl at the for 5 more minutes for another 20 minutes. I finally asked to speak with a manger who apologized and assisted in getting us seated.  Once we were seated it was a VERY pleasant experience.  Our server was a very nice man- Nobody- is his name. He was very patent with our daughters got us our drinks and bread right away.  Our meals came shortly after, I appreciated how EVERYONE from bussboy to managers kept constantly checking in on your tables checking to see if you needed refills, bread etc.  Our dinner was delicious, fresh and hot.  Dessert was amazing= we ordered the bread pudding with ice cream. The location is excellent and the decor inside is very modern, updated and neat.  The main reason I will go back is because of our AMAZING server who's real name is NOBODY. He was great. He shared and amazing, inspiring story about his name and was just an all around nice server. He was patient, funny, took his time with recommendations and constantly checked in on our tables despite the fact that we could tell he had many. He made us all laugh and he even made a big deal for my daughters ""First day of 1st grade celebration""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=160,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124

196,Victoria O.,"Irvine, CA",70,6,2.0,1.0,2015-08-28,"New location is super close to my house, so I've been excited for it to open for a while of course. Came within first week of grand opening, which apparently was a horrible idea. Ordered the BBQ Chicken salad, but I'm vegan. So I said no chicken and cheese, extra black beans instead. Came out with cheese, and didn't notice because it was white and blended in with the jicama strands! Kinda gross considering I'm vegan. Then, to think it couldn't get worse/grosser... A HAIR!!! They spilled a water glass all over the table, kept forgetting things I asked for, too many servers just standing around doing nothing, and I just expected better for a chain like CPK. They put basil in the salad too... Supposed to be cilantro. Completely changes the whole taste of the salad (even though it's so minuscule it was everywhere and wrecked it!!) They did comp the meal, but I was expecting my mom's salad to also get comped. It's the least they could do...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=180,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night and the wait was 40 minutes! I guess this place is a convenient location for a lot of people. We just browsed around the other shops in the plaza to pass time. The bar and pizza counter is open seating but there was no room :( The restaurant looked super busy and it seemed like they had a lot of take out orders to fill. After getting seated, we noticed service was a little slow and frantic. Food didn't seem to be coming out for anyone. We ordered the BBQ chicken salad, pizza, and Kung Pao Spaghetti. The salad was up to par, and the pizza was okay, but the Kung Pao Spaghetti didn't taste as good as I remembered it to be.  Although the service was slow, I guess we were lucky all our food (including the complimentary bread) came out at once since at the table next to ours, everyone got their food except for one kid.. and then his food finally came out when his family finished eating.

Took about 30 minutes to get the food and the pizza was burnt as hell and my Kung pao spaghetti was undercooked. Go to a different location. Never had any problems with other locations.

175,Ana S.,"Irvine, CA",141,37,1.0,3.0,2015-08-30,"I was disappointed with the service. I expected better from a newly opened restaurant. I couldn't tell if our server just hadn't served before, or if she was super new to it. She didn't anticipate our needs. For example: My boyfriend asked for a beer from the menu and she returned to our table to let us know they were out of that beer. He then said he needed a minute to decide on food and noticed a moment later that there's a local beer list available. So when the server returned, he asked to see the list. The server should have offered the list when she returned with the news that the first beer he ordered was out. Our server also took a reallllly long time to notice I needed a box for my leftover food. And she took forever to give us the bill. Considering we were there at the end of the night when we were probably her last table, I would have expected she pay more attention to us, if for no other reason but to get us out of the restaurant after closing. I saw her and another server standing and talking for a while. The food and the decor, however, were great. I'm happy with the revamp of their style. More modern and clean. I had the Asparagus + Arugula Salad and the macaroni and cheese. Both were tasty. I'll be back because I like the food, and this new location is near my place. I hope the service is better next time, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=120,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004
169,Steve C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,204,2788.0,5.0,2015-08-31,"I don't go to CPK much nowadays. The product quality has deteriorated rapidly at the diminishing rate of no return. In most cases, same with the service. I know this one opened last week and figured that if anything, service and product would probably be top notch in the beginning, so I decided to stop by an hour ago.  The people at the front were very welcoming; I was seated with no issues. The server (Natalie)was very professional and nice. The food...shockingly, was good. Everything tasted the way it should.  The White Corn Guac was very good. It had flavor and was not bland. I was skeptical about ordering it because every time I had ordered it in the past, it would taste different each time; usually bland as if a key ingredient was missing...never consistent. The Baja Rolls were very good and had adequate portions of each ingredient. That's a first in a long time with CPK. The lunch BBQ Pizza was extremely good. It brings back memories of CPK in the early 90s when things were consistently good and of quality.  The server was very nice, punctual and accommodating. Other employees (chef, manager...I believe, and other servers) stopped by and inquired about service, refilled my water and took plates away.  I really hope that this location does not change a thing no matter how established they become. I know places usually provide top notch product and service in the very beginning and usually deteriorate over time, but how about staying this way permanently?  Otherwise, if and when I'm really craving CPK, I may have to lookup the new locations that opened within weeks and go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=120,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006

Not much of a waiting area. There are two tables right inside between the bathroom, waiting area, and kitchen... i specifically told my family ""I'd be so pissed if i had to sit there.."". ... guess where we sat?? So we had people walking around us the whole time. Server was understandably uneasy, but tried and did a decent job. My kids got their drinks and food pretty quickly after ordering and were happy. Our drinks took a while, as did our food. I ordered the cedar plank salmon with seasonal veggies instead of spinach- $2 extra and very overcooked, couldn't eat it. My husband got the spicy chipotle chicken pizza... VERY, very spicy. I thought he was exaggerating but i (who enjoys spicy food) had a hard time eating it. Lots of managers, cooks, and general staff walking around.

16,Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998.0,4.0,2015-09-03,"I stopped at this CPK for lunch a week after attending a Yelp event here. I will just be reviewing my lunch but will give a few extra recommendations based on the event in my last paragraph. This location is one of the first ""reimagined"" CPKs that has new decor and menus which will slowly be rolled out to all locations. Arriving solo, the hostess pushed me to sit at their ""pizza bar"" - a counter that faces the prep and pizza-making area. I found this space to be a bit claustrophobic and made me feel uneasy as you constantly have people prepping pizza toppings or actually making pizzas two feet in front of you; I felt like I was being stared at the entire meal. My advice, if you are dining alone, is to not sit here and insist on a table. It might be fun for a kid but otherwise - no. I ordered off the lunch menu: a half-sandwich and salad duo. The sandwich I chose was the roasted turkey and brie on ciabatta. Spinach-quinoa was the salad I picked. Initially they brought me some fresh-out-of-the-oven-one-minute-ago bread which was heavenly. My platter with both salad and sandwich arrived soon after. The salad was very good but requires a knife to cut the large spinach leaves unless you don't mind them flopping all over your chin on the way into your mouth. The salad, aside from the fresh spinach which was sprinkled with quinoa, consisted of crisp Granny Smith apple pieces, marinated cranberries and spiced pecans with a vinaigrette on the side. The flavors seemed to hit every taste bud note - it awakened the tongue and was a pleasure to eat. The sandwich was very good although my first bite was quite bitter thanks to one of the greens which I quickly removed. Turkey and warm brie with bits of pear is a great flavor combination yet it seemed to be missing something. Maybe the honey mustard needed a stronger flavor. I ordered a slice of key lime pie to finish things off. The graham cracker crust was perfect and the key lime was flavorful yet not too strong. Yum-O-Rama. Service was excellent. I was checked up on often and he made fun yet brief conversation every now and then which made the meal all the more enjoyable. As previously mentioned I attended a yelp event here the previous week and can confidently also recommend the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, the grilled ribeye (seriously, CPK now makes a fantastic steak!) and the salted caramel pudding. From the bar I recommend the sangria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=40,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

Not sure about the new look CPK is going for with their Anthorpologie, Crate and Barrel, Fig & Olive type of style, but I just did not feel very comfortable. I like the old CPK look with their booths and white interior.  Maybe because this place was so new but the food wasn't as good either.

I've been a huge fan of CPK for a long time so when I heard they were opening a new location near me, I was super excited. However I never expected such a horrible experience. We arrived here at 9pm on a Sunday, checked in and were told that there will be a 15 minute wait. Which was a little confusing because there wasn't anyone else waiting and there were all kinds of unoccupied tables, from where we can see. Never the less, we patiently set and waited. 20 minutes later a staff member came over, not to apologize for the wait but to inform us that the wait was going to be around 45 minutes. When we ask for an explanation, she acted agitated, stressed out. Her explanation was that the kitchen was backed up with ticket orders and they were incapable of handling additional orders. We were so confused by this explanation and were trying to process it. However without us replying or reacting to her explanation, she immediately called the manager in charge to provide his version of why the kitchen was backed up. To make a long story short... When the manager shows up, he refuses to sit us down at one of many opened tables because they were not going to be able to take our food order for over 45 minutes. He gave us the following 2 options: we could sit at the bar and order drinks only or leave. What the heck!!! I don't know about anyone else, but this is a new one for me. Never before have I experienced a manager refused to accept business.  Therefore beware that at this location, the on site management team poses very little customer service skills, and they are over all incompetent. I will not recommend this location to anyone.

Even at 5:30 on Friday night, we had a wait, so we sat at the bar and had a refreshing, albeit too sweet, mojito. We liked the decor--sort of a modern look with a late 1970's twist, lots of greens and woods--much better than the traditional yellow, black and white tiled CPK's of old. It's a little loud though, and my mom had a hard time hearing some conversation at times. After we were seated, our waiter, Max, suggested a Moscow Mule. My mom had never tried one, but she liked it a lot, especially on a hot evening (She wanted to buy the copper cup). We ordered an asparagus and arugula ""small plate.""  Could have used a dash of lemon juice or some contrasting note, but overall it was fresh, attractive, and tasty. We followed up with Kung Pao pasta and a pear and gorgonzola pizza. We split each and had plenty left to take home. The pasta could have used a bit of cilantro, but overall, this is quality food for the price.  I never understand why some Yelpers complain about CPK food being ""prepackaged"" or whatever, as if the only CPK food they ever ate was stuff they bought in the frozen food aisle at the supermarket. I first ate at a CPK in Newport Beach in 1989 and have always enjoyed their food. To be honest, this chain  just fell off my radar until 2 months ago when we ate at a ""Next chapter"" CPK in Scottsdale. This Alton/Irvine location is also a ""next chapter,"" and I love the improvements in menu selection and decor.

Our server got my order wrong and when I let him know that wasn't what I ordered he insisted that I try the food. I let him know I didn't want the plate yet he continued to insist I try it. I was stuck with a plate that I didn't want. I ended up waiting an extra hour for the actual meal I ordered. I ordered an appetizer and never received it. I ended up taking my food to go because 2 hrs had passed and I hadn't eaten. The last time I went to CPK the hostess told us the wait was 25 mins I let her know I wanted a booth and she told me to let them know when I was about to be seated. Once the 30 mins passed I got called to be seated. I let the hostess know I had requested a booth seat and she told me I had to wait longer because none were available. I asked her if she could text me to notify me when the booth was ready and she agreed. After an hr wait I went inside to see if the booth was ready and the lady was like, ""omg you still haven't been seated?"" I let her know I didn't get a call and she said, "" oh I didn't call your phone I called you outside."" I let her know that she didn't call me and so she said oh I sent you a text. I took out my phone and told her that I didn't get a text so she claimed their messaging must've been down. It's sad the food is good but the service is terrible and I will not be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=200,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004
40,Maggie C.,"Irvine, CA",95,303,1404.0,3.0,2015-09-12,"The NEW CPK has some potential with its new style, concept, and menu. Usually see lots of people coming to check out this new spot.  DÉCOR:  - Updated urban style with seating area in dining room, homey living space, bar counters, and outdoor patio (good for mixer or happy hour) - Indoor waiting area has some comfy couches by the wine refrigerator, and there are a few cozy couches in the outdoor area. One family brought board games for their little ones to play while they waited to be seated. Genius!  SERVICE: okay considering the first month of opening. Put your name and mobile number down with the hostess, and CPK will text you when the table is ready. The wait is going to be longer than anticipated. We estimated 20 min wait and became a 40-45 min wait before we were seated. Server did check in on how we're doing. FOOD: This new CPK has a variety of items including appetizers, salads/soup, main plates (rib-eye, salmon, chicken, etc), pastas, signature pizzas, drinks, wine, and cocktail. There's also gluten free and vegan menu too. GARLIC CREAM FETTUCINE WITH CHICKEN ($14.99): small serving size, but it was too rich and heavy for me. After one bite, I didn't want to continue eating. Could be it was served lukewarm and didn't taste fresh at all. WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA WITH TRUFFLE OIL ($14.99): I've had it when it was fresh off the oven on opening night, which was DELICIOUS! But, when it was served last night, it was a pure disappointment.  You can tell even before eating that it's been sitting out for a while and the bottom of the crust was soggy. No bueno on the consistency of food. Also the truffle oil given was so few :( MUSHROOM PEPPERONI SAUSAGE PIZZA ($14.29): Cremini mushroom, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, basil, mozzarella, and wild Greek oregano: okay, but a bit too salty FIRE-GRILLED RIBEYE ($25.99): grilled with Pinot Noir sea salt and topped with creamy bleu cheese butter served over roasted potatoes and lemon-garlic wild arugula salad: rib-eye was juicy and tender~ PESTO CREAM PASTA WITH CHICKEN ($14.69): yummy penne with sundried tomatoes and basil pesto cream CALIFORNIA ROOTS: vodka, fresh avocado & mint, fresh agave sour, fennel salt rim  - CPK's newest drink tastes too herby and grassy, not a fan Overall service was okay, but food could be good if it were served hot, which presents an issue of consistency. Also it's very loud and noisy in the dining area, which makes conversation a little difficult.If they can resolve the parking and food consistency issue, this could be the new neighborhood restaurant. TIP:  1. For birthday celebration, they provide complimentary ice cream. 2.

I came here for a team work lunch, and I guess this is a new concept CPK. I ordered the half Thai Chicken Lettuce, which I was expecting to come out as lettuce wraps, as they used to make it. It came out to be an actual salad, with fried wontons and everything, and barely any chicken. I also ordered the crispy mac n cheese, which was disappointing as well. It tasted old and cold, so I just scraped off the insides. The service was good, although they did take a long time getting our check and birthday ice cream for my coworker. +Service: Good, but not the best. It got slower the longer we stayed, but that was also during rush lunch hour as well. -Food & Price: It could have been what I ordered, but I think their food could have been better. Even though what I ordered was a half order and was large, it barely had any chicken so I can't justify the price for it.

163,Diana Y.,"Irvine, CA",479,433,356.0,3.0,2015-09-22,"Wow, I was surprised at how packed it was here on a Sunday for dinner. There were many large groups here celebrating bdays or something. This CPK has a nice ambiance for reasonable price and that's why so many people flock here. They can have a nice sit down dinner or for a causal meal.  I was here just for a causal dinner and we were seated quickly. Ordered two different pizzas and the roasted veggie salad. I prefer the hand tossed dough for my pizza. I love the chew of the dough with the crust at the edges. The SO preferred the thin crust pizza and it's much more crunchy. Both are well done so it's good that they have something for everyone's varying tastes. The roasted veggie salad was good, the artichokes were bordering on burnt rather than roasted and it was over dressed. The full size portion is quite large so next time I'd probably ask for half and less dressing. The bread they also provide is very good. It's a freshly baked sourdough and it's so nicely crunchy and crusty but I love the soft inside. The only downside is on this busy night they seemed to have issue with keeping up with making the bread so we didn't get it until almost the same time as our entrees.  I would come back as this is a nice restaurant with a good variety of dishes. The only complaint besides the slowness of bread was that our waitress was a bit of a Debbie downer. I kind of understand as it seemed like it was very busy so she's probably tired but still being in the service industry she should still try to hide the resting face a little.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=120,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7,3.2000000000000006
15,Jamie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",632,521,3875.0,4.0,2015-09-22,"The renovation is absolutely stunning and the earthy, green vibe is felt throughout their menu and attention to detail. CPK is not what you think it is. They've changed...for the better in my opinion.  Met up with a few friends after work to have dinner and a few drinks to help the week pass by a little faster. Everyone needs that mid-week pick me up, right? We were seated in a booth and our server was quick to take our orders, but also give us plenty of time to look over the menu.  We started with drinks - California Crush, Red Sangria and White Sangria. Our server, Mario, was very helpful through suggestions and helped us narrow down our options. We had so many questions (mostly just being indecisive on which one is better) and he answered with a smile through them all.  For food, we decided to start with white corn guacamole & chips. For our dinner, our table got the Brussels & Bacon (well-done) flatbread sans the carmelized onions, Asparagus & Arugula Salad, Mushroom & Spinach flatbread, and Penne Pasta with chicken. Mario came by to check on us every so often, making sure our satisfaction levels were over the moon, pretty much.  To end the evening, we got the salted caramel pudding. After 10 minutes of conversation at the table, the dessert never made an appearance. Mario came by to check on us and personally made sure the dessert was brought right out. To apologize for the long wait, he comp'd it, which took us by surprise. Service is surely on another level since the new renovations. I like! Since one friend had to leave for the evening, the two of us stuck around for another round of drinks at the bar. To our delight, late night happy hour was just about to start! We ordered the Agave margarita (recommended by bartender as the best) and California Roots (super refreshing cocktail with avocado).  Although the weeknight was pretty crazy, it began to slow down by around 9:30 and we got to chat it up with the bartenders about whiskey, bourbon and best things on the menu. Somehow, we got around to decorating a few people's name tags, lol! Thanks for putting up with us barside, Ronnie and Thomas. With the new changes, you're in great hands all around.

176,Jyan K.,"Irvine, CA",235,20,166.0,3.0,2015-10-22,"Probably one of he most nicest looking CPK I've ever been to. The atmosphere is very urban and rustic inside. It looks like a place you would come in and have wine tasting or something.  Service on the other hand is not that great. Waiting time depends on what time of the day you come. Could be seated right away or wait for a few minutes. Came to dine in during a normal time. It wasn't that busy but there were a few people eating inside as well. They take a very long time to get your order and get your food out to you. And when you wait you would think that you'd get their complimentary bread right away but you still don't. We had to ask our server if they even gave it out anymore.  I also came back for a curb side order. Have never done it before so I had no high expectations. I called and told them the model of my car. I expected someone to come out right away since they know you can see them through their glass door, but no one came. Waited 10 minutes and watched as the workers talked to each other the whole time. But the annoying part is that the person who pulled up after me got someone to come out for them right away. No one ever came out so I called and just ordered for takeout instead.  If their food didn't taste so good I probably wouldn't come back anymore. My favorite pizza is the Pad Thai Pizza. Not your average type of pizza but it's really good. My favorite pasta is the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with shrimp. Always a big fan of anything creamy instead of marina style.  Overall, just like every other CPK I have been too, service and waiting time is the worst.

111,Shane D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",630,345,245.0,4.0,2015-10-23,"I hadn't been to a CPK in years, but after a recent Yelp event here I learned that the menu has completely changed. And it's a huge improvement from a couple years ago. First of all, I was blown away by the service. I was first greeted outside the door by a host with an iPad to check me in. Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the pizza bar rather than take up a table. This was a great choice. At the pizza bar you are right in front of the kitchen and can watch everything being made. There was a family next to me with two kids and the chefs have them each some pizza dough to play with while their food was cooking. I had never seen that before, but it was very cool. The kids were having a blast learning how to make a pizza crust. My waiter, Marvin, was outstanding. He was super informative, always smiling and energetic, and constantly ready to refill drinks and answer questions.  The spicy sausage flatbread appetizer was very good, but the cedar plank salmon was excellent. They brought it out with the cedar still smoldering and smelled amazing. The salmon was perfectly cooked and juicy. It was served with limes for the salmon and a very tasty corn, spinach, and feta succotash side dish. The dessert menu is excellent as well. Butter cake, salted caramel pudding, s'mores, red velvet cake, etc. I chose the key lime pie and it had a wonderful graham cracker crust and tasted like authentic key limes, not the fake key lime many restaurants serve.  All in all I was impressed. Although they have kept most of their classics (i.e. Thai Chicken pizza), the rest of the menu is fresh, new, and from what I have tasted so far it is excellent. Despite being a chain (which I normally am not a fan of), it feels more like a local hang out now.

152,T P.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,30,11.0,1.0,2015-10-27,"The management at the Alton/Jeffrey location of CPK needs some work. I've been to this location twice since they opened about a month ago and both times the timing of the kitchen has been very bad.  First experience was lunch by myself, sitting at the bar, about a week after they had the grand opening. Restaurant was not crowded and it was about 2pm, so not a lunch rush. My food, a half order BBQ chicken salad, took about 45 minutes to come out. Bartender/server apologized repeatedly. Whatever. Second experience was a take-out order on a Friday night, about 6pm. Called the local number to the CPK, but got a call center representative. I had a question about an ingredient so the rep transferred me to the restaurant directly. Spoke with the take-out staff, put my order in, and they recommended I come in about 30 minutes for pickup. Once I arrived, it was clear I was going to wait a long time. At least four people ahead of me looked very unhappy and impatient. I saw the shift manager offer to pay one customer's take-out dinner and also gave the customer a free dessert due to the long wait. Once it was my turn, they told me they had to wait on one of my pasta dishes. Well, that wait for one pasta dish turned into 65 minutes (for a total of 95 minutes since I first put the order in). The other food on my order, a pizza, a salad, and some soup, were all ready and sitting on a counter. I asked about the food sitting there and the man at the counter just smiled and put the food in a warming oven behind him. I wasn't happy that my food was just sitting around while one pasta dish was holding up the whole order.  I watched one by one as the manager had to come to the front of the restaurant to apologize to at least three other take-out customers for the delay. I waited for my apology, but didn't seem to be getting one until I had to point out to the manager that most of my order was ready and sitting around while one dish was not up yet. Finally, the manager blamed the take-out call center, then he blamed the kitchen staff being slammed, then he blamed it being a Friday night (you know, a busy night). He offered to comp the pasta dish. Fine, I thought. Then when the pasta dish came out, it was the wrong dish.

This location previously was El Cholo and you needed to be careful you weren't seated by the kitchen because of all the noise and commotion. The redesign has opened the kitchen area and now the noise and commotion is everywhere. The night we were there the music was cranked up apparently so it could be heard over the noise so everyone, including the poor servers, was forced to practically shout while speaking. It was a big disappointment as we had been looking forward to their opening for months.

I say park because literally the AMAZING experienced started there. The moment I parked my car at the curb side parking BOTH doors were opened for my entrance into picking up my order. This was SHOCKING to me. I have reviewed many establishments even those of 5 star standards and this has never happened to me.  Once I walked up to the doors I was greeted by both associates and was directed if it was a takeout or dinning in. They directed me to where I needed to go (without me having to ask!). Following this, the establishment was by far the best I have seen to date! Clean, cool, crisp, music was not too loud, I literally felt like I was a super star. I could not believe that there was a lobby just to wait for your food! When I was paying for my order the cashier referred to me as my name multiple times! I was just shocked that she went that far into her customer service. She not only did that she was very observant and saw I was wearing my work badge and commented on that and got to know me! She asked how long I been there and what I do. She was so skilled in this she didn't even hold up the line she was very swift made me feel important and not rushed. This is a very hard skill to master.  As far as the food! I been eating and writing this at the same time and I can barely concentrate. I have never had bake potato soup before and this is just so amazing I want to again and will be going for dinner! A date mind you to this specific location!  Once I paid and was leaving there were two people who walked up to give me ANOTHER double door exit I just couldn't believe my eyes. I appreciate GREAT customer service and let me tell you this was not that is was the BEST customer service I have ever experienced in the time I have been reviewing establishments or alive for that matter! This location seriously needs some type of recognition. I will do whatever it takes to make that happen! To let you know how serious I am (if you haven't gotten that already). I report bad customer service all the time. It take so much for me to want to give someone a great customer service rating. It takes even more for me to even want to call, let alone write a one page single spaced business letter to cooperate about this.

Their overly loud, bordering-on-obnoxious singing of Happy Birthday was bad enough, only to be followed shortly thereafter by very loud in-your-face obnoxious ""singing"". My friend and I had had more than enough at that point, and simultaneously blurted out to them to keep it down.  Rather than realizing how loud and disturbing they had become, they verbally lashed out at us, from across the room, that we should leave the restaurant, and that they could say anything they wanted. Instead of getting into it with these low-lifes, who should have just gone to a noisy bar for their ""spirited"" celebration, I asked the manager on duty, Edson, to take control of the restaurant by asking the noisy patrons to chill out. Rather than do that, Edson chose to defend the raucous group. So if you want to spend money going out to eat to a place that is already very noisy, where you can hear from across the room every plate and piece of silverware being bussed,  conversations going on nearby and from afar, and can barely hear your own server who's standing right at your table, knock yourself out. And if there are any loud, rude, self-centered low-lifes there taking over the space with their disturbing voices, you can rest assured that the management shares their low-life values of not caring at all about the Other paying customers who are keeping their conversations and behavior to themselves.

After all, they're the original when it comes to different pizzas than the usual NY style pepperoni.  Also have had plank salmon and it was really good, as was the Chinese chicken salad. Went here on a recent Saturday nite at 7:45. I miss the failed Mexican restaurant,, El Cholo, that it replaced. So I was anxious to see what this restaurant is doing to try to win in the hard to succeed city of Irvine. From what restaurant owners have told me, they dictate so much in terms of appearance and other things, and nibble the restaurant profits more than the typical town. So how did they do? Months after their grand opening, so far so good. Outside, the parking was surprisingly not too bad.  This mini mall with Ralphs and a bunch of fast food places, stores, etc. can be as bad as any in Irvine, esp. around 6 PM. Inside, it's definitely the best looking of the 10 or CPK's I've been to. Bright and cheery inside, the kitchen, fired oven, and all the madness was in full view. The bar is pretty cool, There is still that cramped feeling as the other CPK's. When we entered, the smiling young hostess opened the door for us.  We were seated near the far window overlooking the patio, not being used because it was nippy outside.  But  driving by in the warm months of early fall, it was pretty full and the wine and laughter flowed freely..  Our waitress was friendly and prompt with getting our order, drinks, and bread. Our food arrived in 20 minutes. But then she disappeared.  I would've wanted a refill on my coke much earlier.And if something was wrong with our food, I would've had to track someone down.  I'm not shy to do that either even asking for the manager.  After all, now that their pizzas are about $15 each, they better get ir right.  The size of the pizzas are big enough so that my friend and I each ate just a half and both saved the other half for the following day.  The pizzas looked and tasted great as usual.  Mine, Thai chicken this time, had a bit more charred bread than usual. But my friend's Margherita, was perfect. I am rarely in the mood to try their desserts listed on the menu, but they do look pretty good. People next to us had the butter cake and said they likes it.

For dessert, we took hole the butter cake with ice cream. Even after eating it at home, for the price, the butter cake wasn't bad at all. Not dry, sweetness was good, nice and MOIST! The FORKS were a bit weird as the prongs were very close together, which affects the amount of food can be picked up. Our server was a sweetheart. She was very attentive, made us feel comfortable & welcomed, and was apologetic when she felt she was falling behind (even though she wasn't).  Their menu in the store has a lot more of a selection than the one online.  Giving this place 5 STARS as it was a lot better than what I expected & have experienced in the past.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3160000000000003,3.5600000000000005

We were seated pretty quickly but our server was nowhere to be found.  We sat around waiting and even our host came by and asked if our server had come by yet.  Shortly after, an older man came by to introduce himself as our server.  Since we had to wait so long already, we were ready to order our drinks and our meal.  We decided to share the spinach and artichoke dip and the Garlic Chicken Pizza.   The first thing we got was the Spinach and Artichoke dip....even before we got our drinks.  One water and one Arnold Palmer should not take that long to bring out.  After we had started eating our appetizer, the next thing that came out was our freakin pizza..and STILL no drinks.  I was so appalled that the woman bringing out our food didn't even notice that we had no drinks on our tables at all.  I wasnt even able to tell her the first time she came by with our appetizer because she literally dropped it off at our table and ran away.  So when she brought our pizza out, I asked for our drinks.  She apologized and brought it out shortly after even though she wasn't our designated server for the night. Anyways, on to the food.  The Spinach and Artichoke dip was pleasantly very good and decent in size however the Garlic Chicken Pizza was the most plain and tasteless pizza I have ever eaten.  The pizza was flimsy and lacked toppings.  The chicken was dry and onions were really thinly sliced.  It literally looked like they just threw on some toppings in a hurry.  This ""thing"" you call a pizza is $13.99?  Wow, what a huge disappointment and waste of money.  I lost my appetite after the first few bites and instantly regretted coming to CPK for dinner. Overall, service was lacking and the quality of the food was lacking as well.  All I know is that I couldve gone to Pieology or Blazed and created my own pizza with unlimited toppings for way less than what I paid for at CPK.  $30 down the drain, I wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=40,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.7880000000000003,3.5200000000000005

Food: Margherita pizza - Simple yet delicious. Ingredients were good and thin crust was light but flavorful. Caesar salad - We split a full Caesar salad which was a good portion size. If you prefer less dressing, I recommend asking it on the side. I felt the salad a bit more dressing which made it soggy. Butter Cake a la mode - our favorite dish of the night! Similar to Mastro's butter cake. Moist, buttery goodness perfect with vanilla ice cream and sugar crumbles. It's probably made of pure butter but it is truly decadent! Drinks: Mojito - very refreshing, not too sweet, on the stronger side. Moscow mule - gingery, strong, loved it! Blood orange sangria - way way too sweet! I had them re-make it and it was still way too sweet! Tasted like pure simple syrup. Would not recommend. Overall, food was good. It was just the service that really brought down the stars.

73,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1431,2127.0,3.0,2016-11-03,"Irvine's California Pizza Kitchen can work for lunch in Woodbridge Village. I met a client for lunch recently at this location of California Pizza Kitchen which has a more adult and chic interior to it's interior than what I am generally accustomed to. This, (and perhaps the several Yelp events held here during their opening) probably has a lot to do with the somewhat inflated aggregate score it enjoys in comparison to their franchise counterparts.  The service was solid throughout the meal but what I noticed was that the vast menu has something for everyone and deviates from the usual CPK Pizza based menu - or at least what I recall it being. Entree Salads, Fish, Poultry, and even Pasta dishes are available at the $11.00 - $20.00 price range. Of course the Pizza options are still available as well but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised with the change in direction.  On my visit I decided to try the Lunch Duo combination with a Mediterranean/Greek Salad and the California Veggie Pizza and it really was a polarizing experience. The good was the Mediterranean Salad featuring fresh from the field Romaine Lettuce, Roma tomatoes, Garbanzo Beans, Feta crumbles, Black Olives and Red Onions all tossed in a zippy and light Mustard Herb Vinaigrette. This is a fantastic little number on a hot summer day and will be ordered again upon my return visit, no question.  The bad? That California Veggie Pizza. It was awful. A far too-doughy-and-spongy crust is loaded up with Baby Broccoli (!!!), Eggplant (???), Cremini Mushrooms, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Corn (Yes - Corn. Roasted.), Red Onions and a very thin layer of Mozzarella. It actually tastes worse than it sounds and I should really seek psychological guidance after ordering this abomination of a pie. Worst Pizza ever? Damn close - I am trying to come up with something worse and have nothing.  Ugh. Blah. BLEH even. In closing, I really enjoyed the Salad but still wake up in a cold sweat from time to time when that Pizza shows up in nightmares so going forward I will call this California Salad Kitchen as they are much better at the greens than the pie.

I usually go to the one in tustin but this one was closer to where I lived so I decided to give it a try.  I sat down and our waitress walks up and I ask for a veterans menu and she replies with ""thats only for veterans"" so my  reply is I am a veteran and show her my id. And she walks away and gets me a menu no apology or a thank you for your service.  Ok so maybe she didn't mean it in a bad way by it sure some off that way here are a few responses she could have used instead.  ""Oh are you a veteran""  ""Sure I can get you a menu can I see your id"" Another annoying part of the night is that a customer and his girlfriend sat down and he asked for a menu and she said no problem thank you for your service. I was a bit frustrated how the same waitress had two totally different responses even though we were both veterans asking for the same thing a menu.  one good thing about my night was a manager he was so sweet he came and shook every veterans hand and gave us a little thank you card he seemed very genuine.  There was another manger who was a blonde female who came and dropped of our pizza but said they made it wrong and that today was my lucky day and they were going to make another pizza this time the correct way at no charge but she bypassed us about five times and never brought our other pizza. After 30 minutes of waiting we decided to leave.  I may come back only for the nice manger I wish knew his name but I highly doubt it.

19,Jennie M.,"Irvine, CA",0,27,1.0,2.0,2016-11-19,"The food is good enough and typical of CPK. This review is about the bad service, which has been consistently bad since the place opened. My party of four was seated in the bar area. First we were greeted by a passive aggressive waiter who told us we were the first table all night to say ""please."" When we commiserated his response was, ""that's Irvine."" Uh, we live in Irvine, so thanks?  Then Marvin, another waiter, comes to take our order. Poor Marvin. This is just not the job for him. He's worked there since the place opened and just doesn't improve. Last night he completely forgot to submit our order. It wasn't crowded when we were there. How do you take a group's order and then completely forget to enter it? Waiter number one comes by and we tell him we haven't gotten our food. He says ""Marvin must have spaced out"" then brings us a free appetizer and promises free dessert. We don't want dessert, we just want what we ordered. Then Marvin comes by and awkwardly sucks up to us. An apology is nice, but the continued ""I'm sorry, miss"" is just uncomfortable and unnecessary. Like I said, he's just not good at this. Sucking up does not equate to good service. Then Marvin and passive aggressive waiter number one continue hovering over us, offering free food, and passive aggressively asking if they can help when we are reviewing the bill.  How about this: Don't insult Irvine, provide friendly, unobtrusive service, and provide the basics like submitting a table's order on time. You don't need to be fake nice and offer free food to get a tip, and these things don't make up for bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=40,3.6,3.39,3.39,2.9520000000000004,3.474

With that said, we both went with their lunch duo where I ordered a Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza with a Mediterranean salad. I also got an iced tea to go with it. *Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza* It was a nice tasty thin crust 7 inch lunch size pizza. Just the right size for a personal pizza. This combination of ingredients was pretty tried and true for me, so it was a pretty safe bet that I would like it. *The Mediterranean salad* The ingredients for this salad included crisp Romaine, Roma tomatoes, garbanzos, Feta, olives and red onions with herb vinaigrette. This salad stole the show. It was better than the pizza. Our waiter gave us great service. He kept my glass filled with iced tea the whole time. It was at times a little bit too good since he was very eager to get things off of our table when he thought we were done.

I dunno why but normally waiters refill your water with pitcher- but now water has to be ordered and delivered from the bar... The food was pretty heavy- but it's expected when you eat out. Prices are on the higher dollar amount- I don't blame them- Irvine does that to ya.

However, I really didn't recall that the server double check with me that I made that weird order, mushroom with double shrimp. When I looked at the bill, she confirmed that she checked with the chef that they did put double shrimp, again, I agree, it's half dish of shrimp and I ate that. So I did pay for double shrimp, I think I should eat what I pay for. But come on, $25 for a plate like that in CPK? I think it's insane.

When I heard that el cholo, the restaurant that was previously at this location, was closing, I was initially disappointed. I live nearby, and the proximity to a great Mexican restaurant was something I enjoyed. However, after finding out that CPK was going to take its place, I was definitely excited.  First of all, This location is BEAUTIFUL. It's very classic California, with beach themed decor and a huge California flag. There's some local inspiration too, with a photo of the spectrum big wheel, and an Irvine logo. The bar is also gorgeous. Well lit bottles line the shelves at the bottom, wine crates decorate the shelves at the top.  The service here is about what I would expect for a large restaurant that's often full with a wait at peak hours. If you come for a weekend dinner, expect a 20-30 minute wait, and a moderate wait for the food. Despite the business, the kitchen pumps out food quickly and the servers are speedy and proficient.  The food is standard CPK, nothing out of the ordinary for this location of the chain.

A while back I saw an article claiming this location has the original menu plus reimagined California cuisine that was suppose to be healthier.  Drinks: We tried both Moscow mule and the blood orange sangria. Both were too sweet for our liking, but overall good if you like your cocktails sweet.  Food: App: white corn guacamole. Pass on this. It was $5 for literally an ice cream scoop size. Nothing special at all.  Wild mushroom cut noodles: flavoring was good but it was missing something. Maybe a dash of truffle oil? Or fresh herbs? I enjoyed it, but just thought it fell a bit flat.  Carne Asada pizza: good. I'll stick to pizza at cpk.  Then why the one star?? Omg the SERVICE was TERRIBLE. We came on a Friday night, an hour before closing. There were some patrons, but not busy by any means. We got our drink order in super fast, and drinks came out almost right away. We had high hopes. Our server walked away without taking our food order, even tho we were def ready ( closed our menu!). Then we waited..and waited..and waited.. even as our server brought the food to the table NEXT to us TWICE, he never looked at us and actually avoided eye contact! We tried to wave other servers down, no one looked at us at all. We finally stopped a BUSBOY who helped us grab another server. Our originally server came by in another maybe 10 minutes?? To tell us he's not sure if our food order made it in to the system, NEVER acknowledging that he didn't even bother to take our order in the first place. There was an awkward moment when he tried to play off the system error as the other server brought our food out.  To make it worse?? I was literally half way through my food, when he walked by and tried to offer dessert menu. Who does that?!? There are two more CPKs in Irvine.

It would have been amazing if they had given me a fresh biscuit - bc it had serious potential in deliciality. Lastly, the wine - of course I ordered wine after a crap day: it was a New Zealand sauvignon blanc and it was okay BUT what I didn't appreciate is that if I order ""a glass"", I don't want to be given and charged for the 9oz versus the 6oz.  At the time I didn't realize so of course I drank it.

108,Ms. C's Third Grade C.,"Irvine, CA",0,26,,5.0,2017-05-24,"Yummy. CPK is a sit down restaurant. These are 3 reasons I recommend CPK (California Pizza Kitchen) One thing I like about California Pizza Kitchen is the food is heavenly. First of all, the pizza sauce is fresh and tastes amazing. They balance the cheese with the sauce and the crust perfectly as well as all the other food. Also, the crust is crunchy so you have to love it. On your pizza, you can get meat, parmesan cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, and other things. That's why the food is heavenly.    The food has different sizes like kids, personal, and group. There many different pasta's like pasta with sauce and other types. You can also get soup that is delicious. Another thing I like about California Pizza Kitchen is the dessert. My favorite dessert is the ice cream brownie because the vanilla ice cream has a fantastic flavor and the brownie is baked to perfection. Also, there is a kids sized size that is equally amazing. There is a kids ice cream sundae which has awesome toppings like a melted cream. Those are reasons I love the desserts.  The last thing I like about California Pizza Kitchen is you get everything very quick. When you are coming into the parking lot, you find a spot straight away and if someone steals your parking you find more parking straight away. After that, you go inside and get a seat at the bar or a normal seat. At the bar you can see them cook it which is fascinating. You order your drinks and they bring them instantly. Your food comes faster than it takes to add 1 + 1. Those are things that you get  very fast.   Those were three reasons why I  recommend California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-5?start=80,2.84,3.49,3.49,3.604,3.23

Buffalo cauliflower - it's spicy but not too spicy. just the right amount. i wish they added more cheese because i like cheese.. but still good overall. It's surprisingly gooooooood!  2. Tequila chicken pasta - this is the one that i kept forgetting that I like! the pasta was a bit undercooked. It's,uh, a bit hard. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be (is it??) still edible though. It doesnt taste like tequila either...  lol. and has the right amount of chicken and sauce (some CPKs put too little sauce that makes the pasta kinda dry)  3. Chicken BBQ salad -it's salad. Not much i can say abt that :) chicken to salad sa ratio is just abt right.:) and the BBQ salad wasnt overpowering.  The servers were nice and attentive. Parking isnt bad. never had problems with parking during dinner hours. If you come here often... get their app to get pizza dough points.

I dip them in ranch and marinara sauce (yes I know I'm weird) They aren't oily and greasy at all, they are crispy and delicious! Of course you can't go wrong with their pizzas,  I prefer sausage & pepperoni on mines but we tried a 3 cheese pizza with pepperoni, it was delicious! I also enjoy their pastas, the Bolgenese is delicious! My sister tells me they also have Alfredo pasta which is my favorite!! I definitely have to try that next!!  Their seasonal desserts and non-alcoholic drinks always look amazing!

I loved the new updated trendy decor which makes you feel like you're eating at a trendy American New restaurant, while still being able to enjoy the good reliable CPK fare that I like.  When this location first opened, the food was good. They had new things on the menu that I hadn't seen at other CPKs. I thought that this was one of the nuances of the new location. Haha...I hadn't realized that the entire chain was rolling out these non-pizza items.  My family likes the shrimp & chicken lettuce wraps, lemongrass chicken, cedarplank chicken, and the grilled rib-eye, which have been really good. Yes, yes...we get pizzas & salads too, but different strokes for different folks.  HOWEVER!!!!! Recently, the food has been consistently BAD!!! Always overcooked!! Ugh!! On the last visit, I got my lemongrass chicken per usual, but it was sooooo dry and overcooked. The sauce was also very thick, like it had been sitting in the saucepan for way too long and thickened.  I kindly let my server know about my disappointment and she promptly alerted the manager & had the kitchen re-fire the entree. This dish is usually my favorite. The portion is generous so I always take half for my lunch the next day. By the time I got my food, I got full from picking off the plates of my dear family members. Unfortunately, the chicken was still dry. I packed it up for lunch the next day. When I attempted to eat the left-overs for lunch, I kept on sensing a strange grit between my teeth. When I cut into layers of the bok choy, it was completely dusted with dirt. It had NOT been cleaned properly. See picture. The food was completely inedible. Had to throw it out!!! Needless to say, I won't be ordering any non-pizza items or visiting this location for a while. BLECH!!

I wouldn't be surprised if any lawsuits come about. The General Manager Sam is very unprofessional. As a GM you cannot talk to your employees on the floor where other customers can hear your conversation. You don't discipline an employee in front of customers. You can't mistreat your employees when they are working hard to take care of your customers. These are hard workers and you are treating them as if they are children. That's really unprofessional. I will not eat at a place that mistreat their employees. He needs to be reprimanded or fired as this does not make the company look good.
