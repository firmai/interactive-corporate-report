299,Kaitlyn W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,10,7.0,5.0,2012-05-10,"I went to the Coddingtown BJ's last night for a pre opening dinner. Sat at the bar, since that's where my BF was working. Had the BJ's Blonde, and the BJ's Raspberry Cider. Very good and refreshing (and only $4.25 each!) For the meal I got the shrimp taco's (on the menu for $8.95) and my friend got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes ($13.50) Both meals were AMAZING! Cooked perfectly, definitely not frozen, all freshly cooked. Got the pizookie trio with 3 different cookies. Couldn't finish them since we were full, but they were warm, gooey amazingness. For you who don't know what a pizookie is, it is a made to order cookie baked in it's own little pan, topped with a scoop of ice cream.(I think it was $8.50 for all 3) At the bar, they have 1 big TV screen which is split into 4 different screens. As a big baseball fan, major plus. Music was a little loud for my liking, but it was good mixture of music (80's, 90's, now) Definitely will be going back to keep trying all the BJ's beers, watch baseball, and enjoy the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=300,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998
546,Ramon M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",169,38,,4.0,2012-05-11,"I think today was the first day this restaurant was open. It was really crowded and there was a line in the front of the door. We already had a reservation. The place is huge and there are huge TV monitors mounted in every direction, so you can catch news and sports from any table in the house. The staff is still under very heavy training so every table had 2 wait people instead of one. The Bussers were the best, refilling waters and lemonades before you had the chance to ask for refils. The service is very friendly and the the prices are not bad. Lemonade was 2.75 but you get unlimited refills. The beer selection looks great but I had to work so I did not even look at the drink menu. The food was fast and clean, but the waitres brought something different from what we ordered, since we had to go back to work we did not complained ( my friend ordered the cheeeseburger pizza and got a cheeseburguer $9.95)  I ordered the veggie burguer($9.50) . The veggie patty was really tasty but it was too thin for my taste.  The Bignette ($5.95)  at the end was really delicious, served hot and full of vanilla flavor, topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream surrounded by fresh berries. I would go back just for that and coffe after the movies. People on the table next to ours had some great looking dishes that were not on our menu, so maybe I missed them , but I am willing to go back ( any takers?) to check those out. This place is going to be THE hub for sports fans, With more TVs than anywhere else in the 50 mile radius.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=580,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
395,Elizabeth Z.,"Santa Rosa, CA",119,11,,5.0,2012-05-15,"Okay, I could rant for days about how amazing my experience was, but I will give you the short of the long. This was my first time ever dining at a BJ's. The architecture inside and out is just fabulous. The whole vibe is very comfortable. The staff was courteous and most were actually knowledgeable of the food. Not bad having just opened. Although, I feel they could have been a little more laid back, it's not completely fine dining. We started with BJ's Beginnings appetizer plate. Mozzarella sticks, two rolls, and spinach artichoke dip, along with three different sauces. EVERYTHING on that plate blew my mind. Even something as simple as the dip. My caesar salad tasted the most fresh compared to any salad I've had recently. My entree was the lunch portion fettuccine alfredo. Considering the menu is gigantic, I decided on my favorite food, so I am very picky when it comes to this dish. That said, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but still tasted great, and left my stomach with a 'happy full' feeling. My buddies had a calzone and the angus pot roast sandwich. I'm assuming they were both delicious, because the majority of the meal was spent moaning and saying ""oh my god, this is so gooooood"". Finally, I just had to try a dessert on my first visit. I got the cookies and cream Pizookie. I swear this was crafted by gods. I'm a sucker for rich chocolate sweets, and oh my, this just topped off the five star rating. Aside from the restaurant just opening, I have nothing bad to say about this place. They made me an extremely happy gal.

I ordered the Mediterranean pizza, and it I'd give it a high six (out of 10), and my guy ordered the Maui glazed pork chop that he rated a four. He really enjoyed the environment though, as well as the homemade root-bear, so we would probably go again.  Also, our first Server was pretty spazzy. Really, REALLY pushy and seemed to be unaware that they just opened, have a ginormous menu and that it would probably take more than 2 minutes for us to know what we wanted to order. Super annoying. Literally asked us if we knew what we wanted SIX times in less than five minutes! Luckily, she was relieved by another Server, who was much more on the ball. Amendment: My guy thought he was rating 4 out of 5, not the 10 scale I was using for myself.

536,Andrew W.,"Cloverdale, CA",147,22,3.0,1.0,2012-05-16,"1st time at BJ's 2nd day its been opened.. Service was terrible.. Ordered 2 drinks and took our order also ""orange soda and peach lemonade.. Had to remind server that we didn't get our drinks after 10 mins.. Came back and dropped mine off and gf didn't get hers.. Had to tell another server and they came back 10 mins later with drink. Excuse was had technical difficulties?? After 40 mins we didn't get our lettuce chicken wrap yet.. Didn't say anything since there were very busy.. Finally came and the chicken meat was already cold.. Food arrives 20 mins later.. You can tell my pasta was sitting there because the sauce harden already and chicken was also cold.. No comment to server.. Friend asked to reheat shrimp.. Server never came back to check on us.. Another server helping customers had his butt in between the 2 tables and right infront of our faces.. layout was too tight..  Finally asked to speak to a supervisor which I never have done before.. Told her about how the server never came back to reheat shrimp.. How long it took for drinks and appetizer.. Asked for check.. A different server brought our check out as the other server tells us the shrimp is being recooked.. Had to get a supervisor approval beforehand. We said no thanks. Paid our bill which the supervisor did discount but was not the point.. Left 20% tip still and left.. Doubt I will ever go back.. We had like 5 different servers that night.. Just not a great experience for a 1st timer. It was packed giving them the benefit of doubt.. But service was the issue here.. 1st time I ever complained at a restaurant, so had to be pretty bad.. Left 20% tip just because I work in the tipping industry, but if i didn't I would have left only 10% or even less..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=480,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
452,Kelly M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",18,20,15.0,5.0,2012-05-18,"We ate at BJ's the first weekend it opened so we were prepared to wait a bit for food and seatings. The wait was about 45 mins but we called ahead so it wasnt so bad. It was a bit of a struggle to order drinks at the bar, but they were well worth it. My husband had the long island and I had the Strawberry patch. Both very good and strong! For dinner I had the balsalmic glazed chicken and my husband had the deluxe double burger. He said it was the best thing he has ate in a very long time. Mine was also delicious- chicken was cooked well and had good flavor. We also had the chips and salsa for an appetizer which was very good- salsa had a slight BBQ flavor to it which I enjoyed. Servers were very attentive and friendly.

Despite being open just under a week & it being a Saturday night, the service was great! Attentive without being annoyingly hovering. I had the Black & Bleu Burger. It was excellent...so delicious! My daughter had the opened face pot roast sandwich...she loved her meal, too! They have quite the extensive menu & TONS of beer choices, plus mixed drinks & wine.

The bad: Where are the bar TVs??!!  More seats in the Bar face the walls rather then the tvs behind the bar, yet there are none.  Sports bars need many more tvs in the bar.  Really odd to have a good set up behind the bar and nothing to the sides until you get 20 years over in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=540,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997
295,Kevin J.,"San Francisco, CA",2507,873,340.0,2.0,2012-05-21,"BJ's isn't a bad spot for another Cheesecake factory chain.  Unfortunately this place just opened and even though hiccups are expected I would hope seasoned professionals would be hired... that wasn't the case.   Once our table of 7 was seated comfortably and orders placed we waited... and waited... and waited until eventually service kind of stopped for us.  The servers(yes multiple) had failed to check up on us knowing that they had failed at providing excellent customer service. The food eventually came - about 45 mins after orders were placed and we all ate happily.  That is, except me. I ordered a Thai mango chicken salad and the dressing was forgotten.  After waiting another 15 minutes or so I was able to reach someone to get me some dressing.  After about 20mins once the food was consumed my stomach didn't feel all that well.  I can't say it was food poisoning but let's just say my stomach was not happy with BJs. For the most part all servers had pleasant smiles but at the end of the day a smile can only go so far.  Nothing was comped, nor expected to be.  I was asked if I was finished with my plate and before I could mutter a yes the server throw a napkin in my dish and began to pick up my plate. Nerves much? I will probably go back to BJs again for some birthday gathering or late-night drinking but as for the food, I think once was enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=300,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

We ate at a Bj's while visiting friends in southern California and loved it.   Santa Rosa BJ's Breakdown: HOSTS: hot or cold. By this I mean to say that some were very OVERLY sweet and bubbly to the point of being disingenuous or absurdly cold, flat, brass, and distracted.  All and all I give hosts a 2star rating.  SERVICE: Nice, friendly, but tried up-selling way to much. Made it awkward.  Knowledgeable ut a bit robotic. Didnt make a mistake. Would have liked to see a bit more of the PERSON inside the robot though. but who knows, some people may dig that.   All in all service gets a 3 star rating.  BUSSERS: Good job. Saw them twice. Filled waters. FOOD: Cooked well, good presentation. Generous portions but didnt over stuff me or heaven forbid waste food. I dont like to see all the wasted food restaurants throw away, shameful. But Bj's hit it on the head with the portions. Favorite thing we ate was dessert, ordered the Pazookie. Warm chocolate chip cookie, ice cream, chocolate syrup. It was lovely. very good.

It was super crowded when we went on a Thursday evening with a 2 hour wait, but I'm sure that's just cause it recently opened for business. We were incredibly lucky to snag a first come first serve booth in the bar shortly after we got there. Their pizza is always great, beers are good, we love the avocado spring rolls.

390,John w.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,19,,2.0,2012-06-03,"Heard a lot of good things about BJs and so when they came to town excited to try... disspointed now that I have tried. I guess they are still cutting their teeth as things are very disorganized there... I went with a friend who had a bad experience close to opening night but was promised if she tries again it will be better. They recognize her on the way in and apologize for poor service last time so this is a good start, we will surely gett good service to make up for it. Nope. Right off the bat we are told one girl will be our server (forget name now) and immediately a girl with a different name shows up saying she will be our server.  Takes our drink order and a few minutes later a different girl shows up with our drinks and says she will be our server...  I don't get how you screw this up... this is what sections are for... it's not horrible to be sure but really part of the dining experience is making a relationship with your server and if you are going to switch out servers mid service at all the customer should be alerted and explained to about why. Anyway first girl comes back and takes our food order.  We have two tomato mozarella salads (I love buffalo mozarella and at $4 a pop!) I get the chicken pesto flatbread pizza, another person gets the California Chicken and the last just has an order of calimari for an entre.  Server askss if we want the calimari with the starters so he doesn't have to sit there while we both have food and we say yes in fact fire it as fast as they can since we would like to be out done and out in less than an hour -  this should be a resaonable thing for a 2PM seating after the lunch rush. The girl comes by with 3 tomato salads and leaves us one... our server sees this and directs her back so the second shows up a minute later... continues the tone for how the service is here... disoriented. No calimari. We finish our salads - which are tasy however they are not heirloom tomatos (I don't think it says they are so this isn't a ding, just a note) and it's a bit salty... I like salt as much as the next guy but tihs is apparently a trend with their food. We wait for about 10 minutes and our server passes by notices the missing calimari and rushes to the kitchen, brings it out a few minutes later with an apology.  Worst calimari I have had a in a long time.  It's visibly oily and soggy - I taste a piece and it's barely warm, there is no taste of calimari just oil and it's like eating wet cardboard.  The one dish that needed salt and has none. This dish is a total failure in my book. Then the server comes to tell us there is a delay in our entres - could she offer us some soup to make up.  We are in a hurry so this is bad news but say fine, I like the sound of a tomato bisque and she has the chicken noodle. 1 minute later her sandwich comes out... odd... the runner drops it off and reads ""California chicken"" off his kitchen ticket looks at the sandwich and immediately says ""oh I mean chicken club!"".   It's got bacon on it.  She doesn't eat pork and specifically chose the Califronia because it does not have bacon. We explain this to the server and she apologizes and offers a refire of the correct order.  We op to just pick the bacon off and eat it as is.  It's very passable if a bit salty. Our soups come out and my tomato bisque is a frothy salt bucket of a soup.  I don't even finish it and it's not a big cup. The chicken noodle is similarly unremarkable and salty. Finally after the sandwich is almost finished my pizza comes out.  Looks quite tasty.   Is not. There are about 6 tiny cubes of ""chicken"" on it which have the texture and flavor of frozen grocery store pizza chicken.  The ""Pesto"" is visiually accurate but is just slaty.  No real taste basily goodness.  In fact the whole thing is basically a nicely cooked grocery store frozen pizza. Unimpressive. The server apologizes for the bad service again and offers us a pizookie for free, we say no and she pushes again and again to give us soething free so finally we take a few scoops of ice cream.   The ice cream is good.  Ambiance is nice, I am very impressed (as a nerdy guy) by the 100+inch LCD TV over the bar and it's got a nice upscale brewhouse look.   Nothing else impressed me about the experience and I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=400,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
399,Jen B.,"Occidental, CA",0,41,13.0,1.0,2012-06-04,"The food alone deserves one star. They've been open about a month. But I think the food is not going to improve- it's just low quality. The food was literally just like Burger King or McDonalds, but with alcohol and a lot more expensive. I ordered ""fried chicken"". It was ONE ""chicken tender"" type piece that tasted just like gross fast food on top of mashed potatoes that had to be at least 50% dairy and may have been from a powder mix. I cannot believe they had the nerve to send out so little food as an entree, but I was glad after I tasted it. My husband ordered a jalapeno burger which came cold. He said we should have gone to In and Out because those taste much better- and he doesn't even like fast food. The beer had no flavor. The cocktails have no prices on the menu. I ordered a peach cocktail that was too sweet and I felt no alcohol effect. I just cannot tell you how bad the food was. We live in Sonoma County, there is no excuse for this. As a chain I'm sure they have a formula for the food that works Nebraska and Ohio.  As a new restaurant it is understandable that there were some other issues too. There was a lot of people there at 2 in the afternoon, but some empty tables (the place is huge), but they still had five parties waiting to be seated. There was no toilet paper in the women's restroom. As I stated, there were items on the menu with no prices. When serving and clearing the couple at the table next to ours, our waitress put their dirty plates and her tray down on OUR table, while we were sitting right there.

I objected another time to visit due to fear of slow service. Took longer to get the Pizookie than the Pizza. The waiters are green but very sweet and try hard. But whatever is going on in the kitchen I believe is not working.  My other complaint is the extreme NOISE. So loud that one must be prepared to shout to your table group. Feels a bit stressful and not a relaxing eating experience. I don't understand why there isn't some glass in the dividers to help with sound. It is just a large room filled with many tables.

My girlfriends and I were seated promptly on a sunny sunday around 3:30. The place wasn't extremley busy but had a good crowd inside. We ordered the buffalo chicken mini pizza and the great white mini pizza, both were good, a little burnt on the crust but still had good flavor. We all leaned more towards the buffalo chicken pizza then the great white. The appetizer sampler was decent, a bit smaller than what I was expecting for $17 but it worked. We weren't a fan of the avacado egg rolls but the mini southwestern egg rolls were good and we swapped out the artichoke dip for the potato skins, loved the potato skins. Our favorite part was the watermelon mojitos! Probably one of the best ones I've had in Sonoma County.

Negative - very, very loud.  Positive, nice to have signs of life in Coddingtown again. Food was OK, not spectacular, but not problematic either.  Service still a little spotty, with multiple appetizers delivered to my table before we even ordered. It is very loud, so be sure your server get's your order right, or you may be in for a surprise. Will I go again?  Sure.  But not blocking out any dates on my calendar to do it. I ordered the watermelon mojito, which looks spectacular on the table tent, but the fruit was not muddled, so what I got did not look anything like its picture, but still a decent drink. The kid liked the hamburger dinner he had, and liked the environment, probably more than I did. UPDATE Late October 2012. For some reason or other, we keep coming back. Our second experience was primarily entree's - a couple of jambalaya's and two orders of chicken Marsala. Neither entree looked anything like the picture.  The chicken was OK, but just OK.  The jambalaya was fair, and definitely not worth the menu price (both of my friends who ordered this said ""Well, that was a disappointment!"" Really, really loud.  I had a ""laugher"" in the booth next to ours who made it very difficult to talk without screaming.  This was, of course, on top of the already very loud noise levels already existent.    BTW, I have no problem with people going out and having a good time - that's one of the points of going out.  I think I'm just trying to suggest that the environment here is better suited for a couple a drinks, a few appetizers and a couple of laughs - then out the door.  If you're looking for a ""dining experience"", you may be disappointed. And yet - we still keep going!  Third and fourth visits were just sandwiches - which were just fine.  I like the hard ciders that are available and the kid LOVES the house-made Cream Soda.   The cocktails are the part where you'll notice your $$'s headed.  If you can avoid that, this is a much better alternative to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=420,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.44,2.48

It has pairings and a meter from light to dark. He choose the darkest beer, which I thought I would hate, but was actually quite tasty. For dinner he got a pasta dish and I got a cobb salad. I had always thought a cobb salad is something no one can ruin. I mean, hunks of chicken and avocado?? How can anyone do wrong?! Well I guess BJ's can. The lettuce was brown and wilted. The chicken was diced like it had been from a salad barr at Round Table or Something. The lettuce to toppings ratio was so off that I thought lettuce was possibly a topping and dressing was the main course. Pretty dissapointing.

It's only $1 off drinks (mind you, these drinks are like $10 or $11 dollars) and $2 off appetizers (anywhere from $9-$15) wow what a not so happy hour priced happy hour! We ended up paying $33 a person for 2 drinks each and a couple appetizers that we shared. We might as well have gotten dinner instead!!  I kept on hearing things about how awesome the avocado egg rolls are. We ordered them. All they tasted like was warm avocado in a deep fried egg roll crust with a sweet sauce to dip them in. In the picture these look like they aren't just pure avocado deep fried.  Things I did like: The lunch menu has very well priced lunches and they are pretty good. I had this chicken with mashed potatoes and a gravy served in corn. Only $6  The calamari was tasty and so was the dipping sauce it comes with. But then again, how do you go wrong with calamari?  The restaurant is large, spacious, and everything looks very nice (I'd hope so, since it's new) The Pizookies are tasty, but it's not an out of this world, best dessert I have ever tasted experience like it is made out to be. All in all, I won't avoid the place but if it's between BJ's and Russian River brewery or 3rd street ale works, I'll choose for either one of these in a heartbeat.  I truly feel like BJ's is simply Applebee's on steroids with a much much larger and diverse menu and way more expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=300,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.024,3.0400000000000005

He did not have the table ready for us and rudely had us sit on the chairs and wait. Take in mind that the restaurant was barely busy. I thought reservations were to be seated at the time you make them for? He then made it very difficult for us to ""check in."" He mispronounced the party name we had our reservations under and when we corrected him, he didn't think the party was actually us.  This one interaction set us up for not the best experience here.

There were only a couple pieces of tomato which didn't have any flavor, and didn't seem fresh. It was basically mozzarella pieces with some spices and sauce. My friend got a salad which looked weak and not very fresh, especially for how steep the price is. $12 for shredded lettuce? There are sooo many better restaurants in Santa Rosa which have GOOD food.

What I don't like: we sometimes get our appetizers or salads just moments before dinner arrives, and a couple times it came after.  Loud atmosphere so conversations can be a challenge, peanut butter pizookies being sold out at 6:30pm (?!?!?!), and service can be hit or miss.  (Smiling servers can only go so far when everything takes so long or it's obvious she wants to cash out before the shift change.)

They fulfilled are requests in a timely manner and were always around to check on your table to make sure you had everything you needed.  AMBIANCE - 3 STARS.  It's a pretty generic looking place. Feels very corporate to me. They have outdoor seating, which is a lovely touch and is a much quieter alternative to the indoor hall. However, outdoor seating faces the Codding Town Mall parking lot :( bummer. It's not a lovely view. Also, if you're there around sunset, you or your friends who sit facing west will have to bring a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes. Because of the way the seating is arranged, east to west, someone will always be getting sun in their eyes.  BEER - 3 Stars.  The BJ's Hef was pretty watery.  FOOD - 1 Stars.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the regular (slim?) cut fries. I SO wish I could give the food more stars. However, the burger gave me food poisoning, and thats a huge no-no for any establishment.  Seven hours after leaving this place I experienced shivering, chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. Yep foodborne intoxication, folks. Overall, I would give them 1.5 stars on yelp, if I could, mostly for service and ambiance. But the fact that their food makes you sick drags the rating waaay down.

453,Amanda P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2012-10-26,"I have eaten at BJ's at a different location many times, and it was my favorite restaurant. The BJ's in Santa Rosa is AWFUL. I am not going there again.  I order a clam chowder in a bread bowl, and my boyfriend orders the Thai Salmon.  Let's start with the Salmon, his salmon had no sauce AT ALL and came with brown rice. On the menu it specifically says white rice in a Thai mango sauce. This would have been a fantastic healthy food choice if that's what he was going for, but he wasn't. When we tried to find it on the menu, it didn't even exist.......  My clam chowder came in a normal bowl, not a bread bowl. When I told the man who served our food to us, he showed me the receipt so I could see what the waitress wrote down. I don't CARE what the waitress wrote down, it's not my fault. He said it'll take a little bit because they need to put the bread in the oven, I said that's fine. When I finally get my food in a bread bowl, the bread was so charred that it was pointless to eat anyways. They messed up two meals three times. DISAPPOINTED.  We tipped, because we aren't rude, but our food sucked. Also, when we walked out of the revolving exit/entrance door, there was a bottle of windex placed on the handle and a sprayed (but not yet wiped down) window with nobody there.

542,Ashlee Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",66,12,,1.0,2012-12-01,"We went for dessert for my mom's birthday. I had somehow avoided ever going to a BJs even after living in the east bay for awhile. However, it was mom's pick so we went. I may have had some preconceived notions about corporate chain places like this, but I was actually surprised in just how bad it was. First, it was an extremely stormy night so the waxed floor was so slippery I almost fell on the way to our table. I first mentioned this to the hostess, who replied, with a laugh, that because of her nonslip shoes, she wasn't affected by it. Then while waiting for our waiter I watched 3 other people catch themselves from slipping. I again said something to our waiter about how slippery the floor was, and instead of any kind of concern at all, got to again hear about their nonslip shoes! I was absolutely surprised at how little they seemed to care or realize that someone could hurt themselves. That annoyance aside, we ordered our desserts (a scoop of ice cream for me since it was one of only two options under 1000 calories). 45 minutes later, our waiter plopped our desserts on our table without even an acknowledgement of how long we had waited in the ""not busy enough to be excused"" setting. To be fair, our desserts were not bad but certainly not noteworthy in any way. We could've gotten the same thing at Applebee's for less money and probably received slightly better service. We finished in all of 10 minutes, and then were subjected to his horribly rehearsed end line of how much he enjoyed ""spending time"" with us this evening. There was not one minute of our drawn out experience there that was either genuine or remarkable in any way. In the parking lot my fiancé and I turned to each other and asked mercifully to please never make the other go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=580,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.4760000000000002,2.36

For the second time in a row, I have ordered a salad with dressing on the side and received my salad DRENCHED in dressing with a side of EXTRA dressing....really?

Our waitress (?) barely a greeting, started off nice enough, the FIRST time I asked for anything extra, she became completely offended and rude, all I wanted was extra lemon for my terrible ice tea. She maintained her cold attitude until the end. Also as an observation all the staff were pretty vacant, just kind of wandering from table to table, there were managers, I think, but they never left front of house, ever to check on ANYTHING. There was no spirit of service, no apparent want to even be there. The Food: We ordered half salads and the flat bread pizza type stuff. The flat breads were greasy and burnt to the point where i could not tell the difference between my steak pieces and the mushrooms, mine was ""The black and blue,"" Way heavy on the black, burnt and formless pieces of it, barely any blue cheese, not even enough to have some for every slice.  The topper was the salad, more then half the lettuce was slimy and starting to rot, on both salads. The waitress, with barely an apology offered to have them remade, i asked if it would be from the same lettuce, she said ""of course"" I don't think she understood the irony of the situation, we asked for fries as a replacement since they had no other healthy alternatives...the whole situation was a huge let down. Also as a side note, the music was terribly loud and grinding for a Tuesday lunch shift, the decor is dark and dirty.  It appears the main bulk of the budget for design went into the bar area. Which glows like a gem in the middle of the mud puddle...to bad i don't drink.  Another thing, our waitress only had four tables counting us, yet she couldnt be bothered to deliver our food herself, she had someone else do it so she could keep just standing where she was not doing anything.

Normally a drink like this would taste like a Lynchburg lemonade except with a blackberry twist. Wrong! Not here just taste like warm jack with syrup.  The only thing this place has going for them is their beer and their service. The problem with that is the damn appetizer. I ordered came 2 minutes before my meal. Like that makes any sense to do for a customer.  Coddingtown must be charging them top dollar for rent if I'm paying a ton of money for poor food and bad drinks.  The only reason I'm even giving it 2 stars instead of one is because the waitress was fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=520,2.12,2.21,2.21,1.8,2.1740000000000004

Those were seriously so good. A little bit of spice made for a delicious way to start off. Other than that, the food is OK. They also have a large selection of been on tap. I choose the darkest beer, which I thought I would hate, but was actually quite tasty.

436,B S.,"Point Reyes Station, CA",1,48,,1.0,2013-07-24,"Stay away from this place if you expect fresh food. I didn't think I would get old food, especially with the price you pay. With what we were served with, you'll be better off eating at McDonalds. I love eating out at places like this, it's fun and the food is usually decent. Well my mother ordered the chips and salsa and baked potato skins. These were pretty tasty. For the main meal, my wife ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with a side of fries. The Sand which was ok, but it clearly not fresh.. it wasn't even warm. Her fries were OLD and DISGUSTING. You could tell they were soggy just by looking at the grease caked up on them. How hard is it took cook a fresh batch of fries up or at the very least, throw away the fries that have been sitting out for over an hour!? REALLY I ordered the chicken fried steak. I was served the chicken fried chicken! :P No big deal, I told the waitress, she apologized and about 5 minutes later my ""chicken fried steak"" came out. Ok this is where I am absolutely disgusted with this place. First of all, they looked like 2 little patties, not a  chicken fried steak. Second of all EACH PIECE was HALF BLACK from being burnt. Not just Burnt, I mean BURNT. The meat on the inside was BLACK. At the same time, it was COLD. I'm pretty sure they microwaved my chicken fried steak instead of cooking it right. The managers came over and apologized. I didn't really like the fact they told me I just happened to order the worst item on the menu, and that my steaks just happened to be tiny and that they were a little burnt. ( It looked like beef jerky, I almost puked just looking at it ) They should of took responsibility for the abomination they sent out instead of clearly trying to side step something completely unacceptable and disgusting. Look bottom line is this is the absolute worst experience I've had with food, and I've had quite a few fast food places. If your looking for fresh cooked food.. seriously save your money, learn from my mistake. I wouldn't serve my dog what they served us. I don't know if they have lazy stoner cooks in the back or what, but chances are they have not resolved the lazy cooks, which means this could very well happen to you.

342,Ashlyn J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",23,6,,1.0,2013-12-14,"This place is a JOKE. We went in on a Saturday evening with 4 other people. We called ahead and then waited (not long) for our table. That was the best part of our experience. The girl who waited on us was really nice and friendly but was as slow as can be. We decided to be understanding (I am a server myself) because it was so busy and sometimes people get overwhelmed. We were celebrating my sister in laws 21st birthday. our drinks took 25 minutes to come out and she set the tray on the table and admitted that she had no clue what drink was which. We had to tell her. She claimed since she wasn't 21 she didn't know.. I'm sorry, but who on earth hires a server that doesn't know their drink menu?! Our food came out probably 35 minutes after our drinks..However there was no silverware. Being nice we all ate our freaking food with our hands. She came by when the meal was done and finally refilled our waters (that had been empty almost the entire time). My fiancee picked up the check for everyone...nope the nightmare isn't over.  SHE SWITCHED OUR CARD WITH SOMEONE ELSE! We went Christmas shopping after and realized the card he had was NOT the card he gave our server. Tired and pissed off we went BACK to BJ's and spoke to the manager. She had no clue what to do. I don't blame her considering I have never seen this happen. We gave her our info and asked for her to comp the charges on OUR card and the other card considering they weren't our charges to begin with. She comp'd the food but insisted it was against the law to comp alcohol (it's not). We were really nice and tried not to be those rude people everyone hates in a restaurant.  We recommended that they put more servers on on busy nights since our poor server seemed so in over her head. She told us that each server only has three table sections! THREE! How do you not give perfect service?!  There is a pattern of horrible servers at this place. I don't even blame the servers. BJ's needs to do a way better job at training their employees.  This USED to be a place we would frequent. We will not be returning.

Don't forget to order the deep fried artichokes but make sure they arrive piping hot, they taste muuuch better hot. Seasonal pumpkin ale rocks and surprisingly the pizza crust is pretty bomb.  Yup noisy too.  Do I mind? Nah, I sit in the bar so I miss out on all the fun of being ignored by busy servers.  The food is pretty good but I agree with an earlier review the the avocado roll is pretty freaking awful. This coming from a gal who eats them whole. Smeh. If you happen to order the Mahi Tacos, ask them to either lightly toast the tortilla or not at all, if you leave it as is, it comes out pretty stiff and chewy.  Service tonight was spot on. First times a charm. Fortunately most nights I go out,  I'm not in a rush, so I don't mind much if service is slower. But I do have to admit that it hasn't always been great service or great food, but I do love love love the wedge salad so much I punish myself time and time again just to have it.

Well now I can say I understand the poor reviews. Service was bad. Had to ask for refills several times. Took forever just to take our order and even longer for it to finally come out. Note we came on a Thursday at 2:30 so they weren't busy. Then the old came out. We ordered sesame chicken salad and a small deep dish pizza. The salad was actually good. (That's why the yet 2 stars) The pizza was horrible. Didn't think it was possible to ruin a pizza that bad. When finished we ha to ask four times for our bill.

318,Isabella M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,5,,5.0,2013-12-22,"You ""1 star"" and ""2 star"" people need to relax.  I agree that there are some individuals I have heard/seen at this particular BJ's that honestly should not work there, but they do, and hopefully in time they will either become better/more professional at their jobs, or simply move on.  With that being said, I have never had a truly negative time at this BJ's. More than not, my family and I have had EXCELLENT experiences there, every time. Hostesses: There have been busier days where we have been quoted 30-45 minute wait times, and while unfortunate, those quote times have been pretty accurate. And I find it funny how people tend to chew-out those poor girls when it takes ""too long"" for their table to be ready. Do people expect them to ask the people eating at the tables to just stop eating, and leave? Managers are the ones who give the Hosts the quote times to give to us, so just try to relax. We have been seated by our hostesses who have always been friendly, some just quieter or more shy than others, but always kind. They do seem rushed at times, but remember when you were angry with them for taking too long to seat you? Well, they are rushing back to go seat all those other people who were angry too.  Servers: I've had not just one, but a few of THE best servers I've ever experienced in my life at this BJ's. Always quick, even on horrendously busy evenings. Always smiling, always friendly, always knowledgeable, always on top of whatever we have needed, always one step ahead of us on refills, extra sauce, more napkins, etc. And like I said, this has come from MORE than just one server I've experienced. Food: Huge portions and so many options along with very reasonable prices. Not too sure what so many people seem to have an issue with. My boyfriend's food came out a bit too cold for him, once, and our server had it re-heated right away, and all was well. So before people get turned-off from going to this BJ's, I highly suggest that you go in and give it a try. Especially if you, for whatever reason, did NOT have a good experience there before, just try again at least one more time. Sometimes it's a person's attitude that can make all the difference in a situation. 5 of 5 stars.

I went for a work birthday lunch with a group of 6 people total.  We were seated promptly because the place was half empty.  It took 15 minutes for our waitress to arrive the first time and get our drink order.  20 minutes later she returned with our drinks and to take our lunch order.  At this point two people decided not to eat because that had appointments in the afternoon and could not wait any longer.  We watched as two other tables got up and walked out without having received any food. I ordered a burger (because how bad can a burger be?).  About 20 minutes after we ordered the first batch of food came.  So now half of the group watched as the other half of the group ate.  No one wanted to risk waiting because we had no idea how long everything would take.  10 minutes later the rest of the food came with my burger.   The burger was burnt, missing half of the toppings, and the toppings it did have were wilted lettuce and burnt bacon.  I told the waitress to take it back and not bother to bring another one because I did not want to wait and did not want to bother with what ever they sent next.  Three minutes later she returns with a new burger.  This burger was obviously meant for someone else but they just scrapped off the other topping and try to recreate my burger.  It still had bits of cheese and chili sticking too it.  The process of being mangled by the kitchen staff doing who knows what had left it looking like wet cat food.  Overall it was one of the most unappetizing looking things I have ever been served in a restaurant.  I flagged the waitress down and sent it back again. The manger came over and made some halfhearted attempt to apologize.  She would be better serviced in the kitchen monitoring the quality of the food that was coming out.  Nothing that was served was great and much of it was wrong and/or poorly prepared.  Based on our conversation with her we were not the first table to complain that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=300,2.8,2.33,2.33,1.956,2.5180000000000002

But I felt compelled to write this review after eating at BJ's last night because they literally blew my expectations away.  We'd visited the Santa Rosa location a few times previously, and had mostly positive experiences. But last night started off poorly, as our server told us that my wife's pizza took a detour from the oven to the floor on the way to our table. Cooper apologized and offered us a cup of chowder on the house, which we reluctantly accepted. He then said he'd see about comping us the pizza, which we said was unnecessary - accidents happen, right? Well, shortly afterwards the manager came over to apologize about the pizza which she said would be free of charge, and to let us know if she could do anything else. And when a third person who brought over the newly created pizza got to our table, he apologized for the inconvenience. If you're counting at home, that's three apologies from three different people and a free pizza for an accident that we didn't think was a big deal. Wow.  Cooper then told us about how to save even more money by installing the BJ's app on our phones and paying for our meals on it, and enthusiastically helped us through the process. As we were about to leave I thanked him again and told him that they didn't have to do all that they did for us regarding the pizza, and he genuinely remarked that it was his pleasure to work for such a positive place that encourages their employees to think about their guests first.  Admittedly, this was a somewhat unusual experience, and your results may vary. But I don't think I've ever been treated better at a restaurant, so I just wanted to give out some kudos.

I chalked this up to first month bugs.  Unfortunately, even after waiting months and trying again, same results. Inattentive servers, long wait times, and someone at the table had cold fries, no drink, or stranded without food. Food always seemed like Applebee's microwaved food with a larger price tag.

So bad that I would have probably given them only one star. Waitress got confused when we ordered (and there were only 4 of us there...not a big group!), she couldn't figure out how to substitute things. She was VERY slow...took us almost 20 minutes to even get drinks after ordering them (and none of them were fancy...it was mostly just iced tea). And took almost 45 minutes(after ordering...which since our waitress was slow, wasn't until a while after we were seated) to get our food. And I should mention that it wasn't busy in there at all. We would look around and literally wouldn't see our waitress around anywhere...for long periods of time. We didn't get drink refills or water...we asked her once, and she said ""sure thing"" and then didn't come back. Our food was cold when we got it. They messed up one of our orders too. We didn't ask to get anything fixed, because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes to get our food...we were starving!! We also changed our mind about dessert...didn't want to have to try and find our waitress, and then wait. We almost asked to speak to the manager, but decided we just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible, since we'd all ready spent wayyyy too much time there. Months and months later, my boyfriend and I decided to give this BJ's another try, since we do like the food their chain serves. We had a much better experience. That is why I raised the review up to 2 stars. Our hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. They only messed up one small thing on our order...which wasn't bad because since they changed the menu, we both substituted a couple of things. They were quick. The drink I ordered was delicious! The side salads were fresh. And the price isn't too bad. I do wish they had some foods with not quite so high calorie counts...if you're on a diet, don't go here, they list the calories for each menu item....and they are all pretty high in calories in my opinion!  Don't get me wrong, I do like the food BJ's serves, and the atmosphere of their restaurants. This one though is my least favorite of any of the BJ's I have been to.

When we recently went to dinner at this BJ's we left extremely disappointed. My boyfriend and I went out on this night because he had been gifted a BJ's gift card. We were seated right away, which for this busy restaurant scores a lot of extra points! Our server didn't greet us for 20 minutes. After that I made sure to note everything that followed.. She took our food order and our drink order. Brought us our drinks right away. 45 minutes later she finally acknowledged we hadn't received our food or even reassured us it was on it's way. About 5 minutes later she brings out a side Caesar salad, which we hadn't ordered. By this point she has offered us a free dessert for what ever mistake was made that prevented our food from being ready. We thought she brought the salad as a polite gesture and when we tried to mention it hadn't been ordered she brushed us off. Our food came after 20 minutes, we've now waited over an hour since ordering. I've been to BJs when they're swamped, and this was not one of those nights. They had a good crowd but plenty of employees standing around. We eat our dinner and it's takes her 35 minutes before she comes back for the dessert order. Which wasn't a big deal except that we were both disappointed and ready to go.. We got our complimentary desserts and ask for the check. 40 minutes late she drops the check off! At this point, we both feel like this is a joke. Our server would disappear (probably busy doing other things, but unavailable to take our check or answer questions) for 20 minutes at a time and it was getting frustrating. I saw another server who I personally knew and asked them if they could grab our server so we can wrap up and handed them the check. Our server comes back right away and tells us the gift card system is down. So after 3 hours of building frustration, this was the icing on the cake. When I'm looking over our check, I see that she had charged us for that salad. The salad WE DIDNT ORDER! I was too tired to even ask, I just wanted to leave. We paid and left immediately.  I have never been so disappointed leaving a restaurant, especially one that is as established as BJs. If the gift card system is down then the manager should take the card, verify the amount (call it in), and hold it until the system is working and ask us to pay the difference only. Maybe it was this girls first few days of work, but it left us with a really bad experience and I can't help but not want to return and to now share my feelings with others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=380,2.52,2.45,2.45,2.308,2.478

Menu variety was overwhelmingly awesome. I love their beer selection! I had the Jeremiah Red and decided to pair that with my cherry salmon entree, which was hands down one of my favorite dishes, ever. Generous portions, too.  Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking to eat out with a group of people or if you're on a date :) Great food and portions for the prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=140,2.6,2.46,2.46,2.7039999999999997,2.516

Yes, if you read the initial reviews from when BJ's opened; the consensus was...they were horrible. I go to BJ's because my family likes it. I go to appease them. I also suffer from a lack of originality, so I tag along. Food isn't too bad. Yes, the menu is extensive and you should be able to find something to your liking. Odds are, it will be pretty good. Not great, pretty good. You're not going here for a 5-Star dining experience. This is a place to relax with family and friends, grab a beer or a quick bite to eat. Regarding that quick bite to eat, service has gotten a lot better. During a recent busy Saturday evening, we received our food quite quickly. I was very surprised how quick it arrived. To see if it was a aberration, we decided to go the following Saturday (I told you my family likes the place and I lack the ability to come up with a better option). Once again, great service and food arrived shortly after our order. Shock! This place gets a bad rap. Yes, it's a chain. Yes, we have numerous local places that may be 10x better.

422,Joseph T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",51,37,,1.0,2014-10-30,"Food is good, always hot... once you actually get it. Here's how to survive a trip to BJ's.  Put your name on the list as soon as you can. Often we let one person out of the car and have them go put our name on the list while parking the car. Whatever you do, do NOT sit at the bar. The service at the bar is actually worse than on the main floor, which is pretty bad in its own right. When you put your name on the list tell them you do NOT wish to sit at the bar or in the bar area and insist on giving them your last initial too, or give them a funny name that won't be mistaken for someone else. I have in the past been skipped over, then given a table at the bar (which is first come first served)... so essentially I waited around for 30-45 minutes for nothing and was NOT comped any part of the meal nor felt like they properly apologized for their mistake. So give them a name they won't forget and can't be mistaken for someone else. They don't have little vibrating squares like most popular restaurants so unfortunately you will be forced to sit or stand while waiting for your table. I have a solution for that too. If you are not with your kids, go grab a drink at the bar and order an appetizer as well. If you order your appetizer at your table, more often than not it will delay your meal OR it will come out WITH your main course. If you do not intend to get an appetizer, at the very least you will be able to sit down in ear shot of the hostess and enjoy a beverage. HOWEVER, it gets VERY loud in there, so keep your wits about you as if they call your name and you do not hear it, they will seat someone else. The bar tender seems like the best service in that entire restaurant though. So it's easier to get a beer and an appetizer from him than your server, trust me there. When you do get seated, if you want water you will have to ask for it as they do not bring you water unless you ask for it. While you were waiting 20-45 minutes for your table, you should have been looking at the menu... that way the minute you see your waitress you can put in your order. It sometimes takes 5-10 minutes before you will see your server, and they will not come back as often as you'd like them to, so I would advise placing your drinks AND food order the very first time you see her. We've been there 4 times now, and each time figured some new way to minimize the time spent in the restaurant and/or waiting for service or food. Be prepared to spend 1-2 hours in that restaurant on average. These tips will help you survive BJ's of Santa Rosa. I've been to other BJ's down south, they are not all this bad. This particular one however has the worst service in any restaurant I've ever been in. The food is fantastic, the beer is pretty darn good too, but the service is terrible. 2/4 waitresses we've had did not look like they were happy to work there. I feel like this is due to the improper floor management or them being overworked. Often in a restaurant it is not your servers, but rather the management that should be looked at to solve all the issues I've listed above. Their disposition is most likely a representation of their frustration with poor management. Ways to improve BJ's. Online check in for waiting, little buzzer things, better management, and improved servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=360,2.84,2.58,2.58,2.084,2.684

(Never asked/ offered a sub)  When he was called on the dish appearance he took it back, took 10 min to come back with an explanation that they were out of something (later to find they don't even offer that something anymore) 6- brought their nasty special brew beer for the mistake, didn't ask the youngsters at the table for ID, then asked if more of us wanted to try it (this was before we tasted it) , we said yes and he never brought it. 7- when asked for boxes he never came back to the table!  Second waiter 1- creeped by the table looked like a weirdo,  circled back on the other side of the aisle and then came leaned his belly over the edge of the table and asked if everything was ok 2- when asked what happened to the other waiter he states that he ""had to leave"". We thought he got fired or something! He says no he was just sent home due to labor because the management wants to watch labor costs so he will be our new server.  3- he also reaches in front of our faces without a word, then gets rude when asked why he keeps doing that without saying ""excuse me"". 4- when he brought the boxes ,finally, he waits until we all put our food in the containers and stands there grabbing plates until the table is mostly empty.   5- Offers desert by stating ""since you're boxing your food you guys probably don't want a desert...""  6- we order a pizookie after what seemed like we had to beg him to tell us what flavors they had.  I know this sounds like a long evening at this place and it was, trust me.  After all this we wanted to speak to the manager of course.  1- he listened, said they both were NOT new servers,  apologized half heartedly,  then offers to fix the bill taking the ruined dish off.  2- had an attitude about the whole thing 3- could be seen (not far away) speaking harshly to the 1st server,  then barely saying anything to the 2nd. The ""fixed"" bill still came to almost $100 even though we ordered no alcohol,  expensive plates, and mostly all drank water.

516,Ruby L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,1.0,2015-01-09,"Just got back from BJ's in Santa Rosa. What started out as a great family evening quickly went down hill fast. We had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad considering it was dinner time on a Friday night. We were a party of four adults and three kids. Placed our order with 2 appetizers and waited 45 minutes just to get the those. These were good. It took another 25 minutes for some of our meals to come after we had finished the appetizers. The kids got theirs first which was a good thing - However the spaghetti was  a only a table spoon full of sauce over a bowl of clumped dried out noodles, yuck! This is when it got really fun, the next four meals came out each about 10 minutes apart and each one regressing further. By the time the last of the four meals was brought out which was a hamburger no bun Paleo style. This thing was a joke, it was a golf ball sized patty half broken tossed all over the plate. As its being handed over, the waiter is mumbling saying "" I know we are missing some components to the burger but the chef is working on it"". We're already talking 1 1/2 hrs! This is when we had enough. The patty was cold enough to stop a nose bleed and small enough to be considered a booger:) My mom's meal that's a whole other story. 30 minute ordeal and the meal couldn't be eaten! At this point in the dinner we had already pasted the point of no return and were just trying not to laugh or make the wait staff, who was working and trying very hard not to get more flustered. All this being said I felt bad for the staff because clearly something was wrong from deep inside the room where they killed I mean cooked the food. Will we eat there again, no, would I recommend the place to anyone, yes, but only to a Sasquatch! Trust me it was that bad and I never like to complain. We had to ask 2 different time to see the manager and finally after a good 20 minutes he came and apologized and said he would make it right. Not!

My husband and I were shopping and decided to stop in to BJs for a late lunch on Saturday 03/07/15. It appears to be a pretty popular place and we have seen multiple friends ""check-in"" at this location on Facebook. When we arrived I asked the host if we could sit on the patio, he told me ""let me check if we have a clean table available"". He quickly returned to lead us outside. He brought us to a disgusting table! The table itself was wiped clean but the seats were covered in crumbs and the floor underneath was coated in mac n cheese! My husband and I looked at each other like ""seriously"" and couldn't help but to laugh a little. We were shocked! When I pointed out how dirty it was he said ""let me grab someone to clean that"" ...wasn't that what he had gone to check on before he lead us out there? We now were standing there awkwardly waiting for someone to come clean up the mess. Even the people already seated were shocked and a couple seated nearby even commented to us about gross it was. When someone came over to ""clean up"" he swept the seats with the same broom he used on the floor, GROSS! We asked to be seated at another table down the way a bit which was also dirty but at least the floor and seats were semi-decent. He quickly cleaned the table up and apologized to us and even he seemed surprised that the host brought us out there. I felt in my gut that we should have left at that moment, however we stayed. Mistake! We ordered drinks, mine was a Mocktail since I'm pregnant and it was fine. My husband ordered a BJs Mojito and it tasted like limeaid, it was EXTREMELY weak. My mocktail tasted stronger lol, I actually had to double check with the waitress that there was no alcohol in it. We let the waitress know that his drink was weak and she suggested an additional shot and he happily accepted ...but she charged us for it! Seriously? We then ordered a good amount of food and my reviews of it follows:  Calamari - it was ok, not very crispy and a little limp.  Carnitas Fries - soggy soggy soggy.  Bison burger - the patty tasted like anything but what a bison burger should taste like. It was more like a pre-frozen grocery store patty or something you could get at Burger King, YUCK!  We also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms - this was the only plate that was good, they were very good and I wish everything else had been too.  Our waitress was pleasant, she seemed a little shy and reserved but very sweet. I honestly feel like our experience there was crap, and that's putting it lightly. I am not one to cause a scene in a public place so we left her a cash tip and went on our way peacefully. I have since written an email to BJs for review and I have requested a FULL REFUND!! I paid $60.19 for a crap meal and dirty tables. I do not want to be offered a gift card or free meal on BJs I simply want my money back!

I went in today with my husband, 18 month old and I'll go ahead and mention that I'm 9 months pregnant. Today was Sunday 3/29/15 at 12 pm. We were seated within 5 minutes. The problem began once we were seated. We were NEVER helped. NEVER acknowledged. It was lunch time on Sunday but this place was not busy whatsoever. Our section had maybe 3 tables with people besides us. We also saw 3 servers working in this section (not training anyone - 3 individual servers). 10 minutes go by.. We're annoyed. 20 minutes go by and we're considering leaving. 30 minutes later and my daughter is getting tired of waiting, my husband is already half way through his lunch break and I'm STARVING and THIRSTY. No one even brought us water. 30 minutes is BEYOND ridiculous to be acknowledged.. Worst part.. We never were! We got up and left at the 30 minute mark. Since we did not have time at this point, I decided to call and speak to the manager from the car ride to fast food so my husband could eat something before going to work. This manager is a joke. He is the worst. He was extremely rude and obviously didn't give a crap about what I was saying. I was pleasant on the phone.. I'm NOT the person that calls yelling and being rude.  His response was basically uh huh.. Okay.. Well you can come back and I can make sure someone serves you. Really? That's it? First of all we don't have time to come back and wait for food. Especially food that I'm sure will be spit in at this point. Didn't offer some type of discount or a free meal. Basically told me there was no he was going to do and to deal with it and that it didn't bother him if we never ate there again..  Seriously?? Yes, I know..

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted at the front desk and asked how many.  My wife responded ""Two..."" and continued to request a table, not a booth, but the girl at the desk turned her back on my wife and didn't listen to her.  She directed a seater to seat us in a booth.  We responded that we did not want a booth and had stated so but she chose to turn her back on us and ignore what my wife was saying.  Not starting off on a good note. Our waiter, Ryan, eventually showed up and asked if he could get us something to drink.  Why sure, diet cokes, please.  ""Is pepsi ok?""  Sure...  He produced the drinks and was off somewhere else. After a rather long wait to order, he returned.  I ordered two small appetizers for my wife and I and then we continued to order the rest of our meals.  After another 10 minutes or so, we were served our salads by someone else.  I figured our appetizers would be the first thing we'd get, but no.  I figured they would be next before our meal, but no.  We were served our meals by yet a third person who we told to cancel the appetizer orders since they were never served as appetizers -- before the meal.  ""Oh, sure."" About 4 or 5 minutes later yet another person comes out to our table with the appetizers we had canceled because we were already served our salads and meals.  No, we canceled those because they didn't get delivered before our meals.  ""Oh, well let me take care of that.""  Apparently this person found our waiter and told Ryan that we had canceled the appetizers since they weren't delivered before the salad and the meals we were already well into.  Ryan then comes over and announces ""I've taken care of the appetizers for you.""  Really, Ryan?  I think that if you'd taken care of the appetizers for us, they wouldn't have come out to us after we canceled them in the first place. The problem seems to be that there are too many people taking care of an individual table.  Our waiter didn't seem to serve any part of the meal, other people were.  Many other people.  There's too much of a disconnect between the customer and the waiter and what does or does not come out from the kitchen.  Very poor customer service in this respect.  The waiter should be doing that or at least overseeing that to make sure it goes smoothly. And finally, when it came time for us to pay the bill and leave, Ryan takes the payment and then doesn't come back for some time.  My wife is watching him BSing with another one of the waiters for quite some time.  Then Ryan comes back and lies to us saying ""I'm sorry I was late as I had a couple of other matters I was taking care of.""  Really, Ryan?  I guess ""a couple of other matters"" really translates into ""I didn't care enough about you to take care of you in a timely manner because I was BSing with my friends.""   The food that we received was pretty good and hot.  I had the Jambalaya and my wife had pasta and scampi.  I'd give the food 3 to 4 stars.  The service I'd give 1 star.  The prices are high enough that I expect service to match.  Between the greeter and the server, it's just a shame that the help didn't care enough about the customer to serve them correctly because we most likely will not be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=240,2.2,2.59,2.388,1.8960000000000001,2.434

All you have do at that point is apologize and try to be as gracious as possible about any and all complications. It really isn't that hard to do.

They took us over to a table (not a booth, but I didn't voice my preference) and didn't ask if my 2 year old needed a high chair or booster, but luckily he was fine in a chair.  We ordered a pizza, since they usually are pretty good.  Not so much this time, but whatever.  We also ordered a BOWL of clam chowder for a ridiculous $6.50.  Usually just get the cup, but we were hungry and wanted to share.  It looked like they dumped the cup into a bowl; it was not a lot of soup for that price.  When the pizza finally came, they had to find some plates for us, and only brought 2.  So we had to ask for another for the kid.  We also asked for some ranch to dip the crusts in, and they brought ONE tiny cup for the 3 of us... smh So sorry about the rambling essay, but we've wasted enough money giving this BJ's multiple chances for redemption.  I'd suggest finding someplace else to go.  There's a Chipotle next door, and a Dim Sum place down the street we'll go to next time we're in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=320,2.24,2.53,2.324,2.2800000000000002,2.414

We noticed food was taking a bit longer than what we have experienced before at other restaurants, we inquired about it and were told it should be coming shortly. After about an hour I received my burger and fries before my salad, not a deal breaker. My daughter received her rack of ribs, my son his kid's pizza, someone else a pasta. Another 15 minutes later my husband' uncle received his soup and appetizer. Due to waiting for the food so long we began eating. Half way through his soup he found an earring! I have added the picture. We asked for the manager, when he came around he explained that earrings weren't allowed in the kitchen area, however gave no explanation as to how it got there. We informed him that by this time we had been waiting too long for our food, I had finished my burger and 5 others had not received their orders. A few minutes later two more orders (Andy appetizers) were brought out. My husband's cousin was genuinely upset that her order, a salad, had yet to reach the table. We received appetizers (also after the burger and rack of ribs, one would imagine those come before the entrees), but no salad? At that point she and my husband cancelled their order, two more orders were never brought, then they said there was a confusion about who's order was cancelled. It could have been easily resolved if they would have asked. Through all this Melissa was refilling drinks, I honestly think she felt embarrassed about the whole ordeal. We do not blame our waitress, she was attentive. We did not pay for our bill as the manager waived it. However a wonderful night with family was ruined! We were easily there for almost 3 hours, at least 2 of those waiting for food! They resorted to eating at a drive thru instead. I am unsure if this is common practice at Santa Rosa's BJ's but after I looked up reviews (wish I truly hoped we would have looked at before going in) it seems that mediocrity is a problem. We were very upset, and highly doubt we will return to this restaurant. For your future guests I recommend you solve the issue, take this as a learning experience and hopefully you are able to provide a wonderful dinner to your future guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=200,2.92,2.59,2.376,2.2760000000000002,2.7219999999999995
341,Mitchell B.,"Petaluma, CA",0,5,,2.0,2015-10-18,"Waited over an hour for food during an admittedly pretty busy Saturday night. Our waitress didn't check on us between ordering and receiving food. Eventually a manager came by and apologized (still no waitress) and confirmed that their kitchen was busy and was making our food (2 burgers and a French dip, nothing special) The food we received was lukewarm and they actually brought out the wrong kind of burger for my dad, but he wasn't going to wait again, so we all ate because we were very hungry at that point.  When our waitress brought us the check, she acted like nothing bad had happened. No apology. The management did take off my dad's entire meal and reduced the price of the rest of the food/drink.  While service from the waitress was poor and the kitchen was primarily to blame, the manager or supervisor who came by was professional and understanding of our annoyance. I work in food service too and I definitely understand the position he was in. He's the reason why I gave BJ's 2 stars.  This was my first and probably last trip to BJ's.

However, I go here quit often with friends and I have never had a bad experience with their food. They have a good steak, good ribs, and in my opinion they best claim chowder in the local area (surprising right!?). Without driving out to the coast, its my favorite spot to get claim chowder.

But this place has had pretty bad service every time I've been here which is 4 or 5 times at this point. To be clear though, most of the times it wasn't the waitresses fault.

He was super friendly and made several excellent recommendations for food and drinks. I had their royal soda and husband had a beer and cider mix, both super good. We ordered a deep dish pizza, which I was really impressed with. I don't usually like deep dish pizza because it's too saucy and soggy, but this one was perfect! In fact, it's still just as good the next day! We ordered a pizooki sampler, which was out of this world good. The total came to 53 dollars, which I feel is completely reasonable for how much food we got. Excellent atmosphere, service, and food.

I cannot eat raw meat, so I always order the steak well done (I know it's frowned upon in the steak eater world,  but it tastes amazing to me). My steak was bloody beyond what I could tolerate. I hate complaining and considered eating everything else and taking the steak to go and cooking it at home to eat later. My boyfriend somehow convinced me to take it back to the kitchen,  which I was prepared to do, but almost 10 minutes pass and our waitress is nowhere to be found. We decide to switch meats,  since he doesn't mind raw meat. I have work early in the morning,  I cannot wait another hour for meat. I wish the steak was my only complaint.  The ""steamed"" veggies still had a significant crunch (could not stab with a fork) and mashed potatoes were cold (I did not wait 10 minutes to eat these.

After 15 minutes of multiple servers  walking by not making eye contact and not one acknowledgment that we were there we decided to leave and go elsewhere. When we passed the host stand in the front I said we were leaving so our table was open and was returned a simple, 'OK, thanks' I'm disappointed with this location.

You know you will get a solid food selection for a decent price. I had the Ahi tuna salad and it didn't disappoint. The Sriracha brussels sprouts were great.  Our server was friendly and refilled the drinks before they hit the bottom, which is always a plus. The experience wasn't the same for everyone to my party. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, and noted that they weren't very good compared to previous visits. Maybe a fluke?  Lastly, their deep deep-fried skills need some work as my kids chicken tenders, mini corndogs, and french fries were a bit overcooked/burnt.  Luckily, they drowned them all and ketchup and were satisfied enough. Again, BJ's is the middle-of-the-road place. You know what you'll get, which is nice, but you won't be overly impressed on my opinion.  Solid choice for a family outing.

When it came to our main dishes (3 pizzas), there was a slight delay which we barely noticed until the manager himself came by to apologize. But when they did bring us our pizzas, one of them was entirely wrong. The manager came by again to apologize again. Ultimately, he added a forgotten topping to the same pizza to sort of half-correct the issue, but also offered us a free pizza to go (the correct one). It means a lot to me that the manager would own up to a mistake and apologize in person. I've been to a few BJ's and I will probably continue to to go to them, even though it seems like every time we go there is always, like ALWAYS some minor screw up. Nothing so egregious to stop us from going, but seriously BJ's? How hard is it to find good wait staff in like EVERY city you operate in?

I waited over an hour for this sandwich that looked delicious on the menu, only to find it burnt to a crisp, then told I could get a new slice of bread. Woohoo! Exactly how I wanted to spend $15. I would have never gone back, but friends were getting together there so I decided to meet them. This time I thought would be better, as it has been almost 2 years since I was there last. Our waitress was nice, and checked on us regularly. I ordered a beer ($6.95), and it was warm by the time I got it. Who wants a warm beer after a long day? I sucked it up and drank it anyway because they were busy and I understand. The bill came. I left $12 for my $6.95 beer. Clearly tipping. We leave, and the waitress chased us out to the parking lot ""um excuse me! Did you not enjoy your service? I'll have fun explaining that to my kids!"" At first I felt bad. Like ""oh shoot did I do something wrong?"" But the fact that she chased us out to the parking lot to guilt trip us about not leaving her enough tip turned that around. I understand, I work for tips. You can have the greatest service and sometimes people don't tip you what you think you deserve, and you get this urge to tell them off. But you don't chase people to the parking lot to complain about the amount they tipped you. $5 on a $7 beer is plenty, especially when it's a warm beer! The only reason I gave them even one star is because 1. I had to, and 2. They had clean restrooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=240,2.52,2.66,2.572,1.7320000000000002,2.604

It takes a while for food to come out when they are slammed but their staff usually acknowledges it and keeps you updated.   I have had pretty good experiences here with servers.  They all seem happy and like treat their customers right.  I am a sucker for the twisted BLT salad..

I didn't see this as a problem as I've ordered through Grubhub before, it's a Saturday night, and I used to work in the restaurant industry so I knew they would be busy. About an hour and a half after I placed my order I get a call from the delivery person saying BJ's was busy but he would have my order to me around 7:15-7:30, also not a problem (and A+ for communication). Around 7:05pm, almost 2 hours after my order was placed, I get a call from FoodToYou about my Grubhub order. They said BJ's just called to let me know that one of the items I ordered was no longer on the menu. I pick a different item. Needless to say I am frustrated by this situation. It's now almost 8pm and my food isn't here. I'm assuming it's because BJ's waited 2 hours AFTER my order was placed to call and figure out if I wanted a replacement. Maybe don't offer extra services like delivery orders at your establishment when you can't even handle in-house business (which is clear from other reviews before me)? I would really appreciate a refund. *follow-up* food arrived at 8:15pm, 3 hours after I ordered it (clearly not Grubhub's fault). Shrimp tacos had 3 shrimp between 2 tacos.

Tables were unbussed for very long periods of time with customers waiting in the lobby yet 3 young people were hosting the from lobby ! I would've given more stars that after ordering nachos that just came with a sprinkling of cheese some chopped tomatoes something that seemed like leftover chili on the bottom and they were kind of dry and not that tasteful that definitely made them lose half a star, The other loss was the side of avocado they bought out to go on top of the nachos as we were told it came with it that was brown rotten and unappealing we left it on the side of our table nobody took it away finally I had to ask the waitress if she would remove it and asked why would you serve that, it's rotten she said one word - yes!   She proceeded to take away the dish but never bought us back any avocado how strange. We finished our appetizer mostly with her fingers after all it was a nachos but no napkins or silverware which we ended up asking the server for. The music was super loud the restaurant was packed we couldn't even hear them calling out the names and the front lobby and they never made an effort to walk out from behind the podium to make sure people heard them, even though three people were in the hosts area upfront. The visit we had before this one was equally as an impressive with food coming out at random times, the wrong items coming out, then forgetting that I was a BJ rewards member, and both visits neither one of the service thanked us for our visit asked us to come back and was absent of any customer service. So far far they are two for two strikes may give them my more opportunity to redeem themselves before I consider spending my money elsewhere.

Lesson learned. I'll never go there again. Whoever manages this place needs to do employee training and be clear on communication between servers and guests.

When we received our appetizer (from a bus boy, not our waitress) we were not given silverware and despite our efforts to get someone's attention, we just ate with our hands. On top of that, the appetizer was clearly not fresh or what we ordered! There were two avocado egg rolls on the plate but all the others were filled with some sort of mystery meat like filling. It didn't taste right and looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. As we watched other people eating and leaving, we were unattended to for nearly 1 hour. When another bus boy finally brought our meals, we still had no silverware and had to ask. When we opened up the silverware, it was dirty and we had to flag down someone else for a clean set. Then we noticed that they had neglected to bring out my husbands baked potato. We had to flag the waitress again who went and retrieved it but by that time, he had already finished his meal. He decided to eat it anyway but with the first bite he found it was still hard in the middle! Not even cooked! We sat there, for nearly 30 MORE minutes waiting to be acknowledged but that never happened. Our waitress looked as if she was tending to 3-4 too many tables at once. She was running frantically around all over the restaurant and into the kitchen. There were dozens of empty tables and people were waiting 10+ minutes to be seated. Not sure if their staffing wasn't up to par or what. What a joke!! When she finally came back we expressed our concerns, mostly about the kitchen, and she told us that she was sorry and that it's been bad for about 2 months. So 1.5 hours later we are finally leaving and reluctantly paying for poor quality food and a terrible experience. Defiantly won't be coming back!

We decided to sit at a table near the bar instead. A waitress, Angela, serving that table was not only happy to have us but went out of her way to take care of us. Being new years day  and all, the restaurant was super busy and appeared that the restaurant was short staffed: empty tables, folks waiting in the front for a seat.. Anyway, without going into a long winded story about every minor detail, we ordered appetizers and eventually entrees..The entrees came but the entrees seriously lagged after the apps. In fact we saw adjacent tables come and go and what looked like our order be delivered to another table. I watched the recipients of that food and thought it odd that they seemed a bit surprised by the delivery of the food. Later I learned the Santa Rosa individuals without integrity ate our food with having the decency to admit the misdelivery. Minutes passed. Angela returned and apologized for the delay explaining the short staff issue and deviants that accepted unordered food.  The manager came out and talked to us about the issues this day. She was bound to make things right and she went out of her way to make it so. I have worked in the restaurant business myself and know the pressure of prime time.

Cocktails came in reasonable time, but the server forgot my child's drink. Artichoke dip appetizer came about 15 min later and not only looked like it was under the heat lamp for awhile but was burned so bad it smelled like charcoal smoke. We barely touched it. Our dinner came 30 min later, at this point it was over an hour after we sat down and all the tables around us had left and been reseated. I like their jambalia, it's spicy, but this time it was unediable. It's like the top of the paprika jar came off. Again the dish looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp. The server initially forgot my child's side of fruit too. My husband burger was good and cooked properly. I told the server my meal was disappointing and way over seasoned. We got a ""sorry"" but with all the problems I would have appreciated something taken off the bill.

I asked our waitress for a side of broccoli because the chef forgot it and she said ""dang, you caught it."" Tonight, they left out the chicken in my CHICKEN Alfredo.

Received the drinks we ordered; the Diet Dr Pepper was flat and flavorless and the water tasted like it was right out of the tap. The Brussels Sprouts appetizer arrived looking liked someone had tried unsuccessfully to drizzle the sauce on but maybe the device broke and spewed the sauce all over in messy disgusting blobs.  They were also served without the usual accompanying small plates which we had to ask for repeatedly from several servers.  They finally arrived 10 minutes later. We had asked for a replacement napkin when it fell on the floor and a new fork but after asking several servers in a row we finally received them after 20 minutes. The Jambalaya arrived looking like it had been under the heat lamp for an extraordinarily long amount of time and was flat and old looking; it also had very little meat. The Clam Chowder in a sourdough bowl was very foul (I nearly vomited it up at home!) and the bread bowl was so tough you couldn't tear it off or even cut it with a knife. The silverware was seemingly old and weird, everything kept sticking to it and wouldn't even wipe off with a napkin; the knives were a dull joke.

The 1st time I came here, a girl washing the front windows turned around, ran into me & tripped me as I was walking in. Another time I came for lunch, the order was wrong & took a long time, but the bartender refused to correct it. I've been to over a dozen BJ's in the past 20 years from here to samdiego, but this one had the worst service from the start. I loved their Tatonka Stout, PM Porter, Jeremiah Red, & their IPA too. They even made a 10% Grand Cru annually. For a chain, BJ's was a great place to stop when traveling to drink & eat, especially when there were no other local breweries around. Happy hour & dinner were both good, & most had a larger selection of guest beers than their own on draft. Never cared for the wall of sports tv's or the high noise level, however.

About 20 minutes later our dinners came and no appetizer. We asked to just take it off the bill but she gave it to us for free anyway. My burger had obviously been sitting as it had lost its warmth by bite number 3. The shredded cheese wasnt even melted on top and made the whole thing just awful.

Our most recent visit, about a week ago (I checked in with my tasty sangria) it was not bad, but also not as good as we've experienced.  Yes, the wait for food was a while, but it was a Saturday night.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, medium, but it was way over done. Definitely not medium, but I didn't complain.  Our order was served hot and ready to eat.  Husband says the jambalaya was VERY salty this time around.  Child enjoyed her mac & cheese.  Really can't complain, much.

62,Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,1.0,2017-03-23,"I really wanted a burger.  We were both off on a Thursday afternoon. We decided to drive to Santa Rosa to pick something up for the house and have a late lunch. Someone had recommended Jack's Urban Eats for a burger. They don't have burgers.  So we went to BJ's. When we walked in there were a few people in there. The hostesses were busy with something between them but we were seated without issue.  Our server arrived and did her job offering a variety of beverages. She brought the ice tea and it was sad. It was water with a hint of tea. It was just standard tea, not one of the fruit ones. We did try one of the others and it was equally bland. Eh, not a big deal, just disappointing.  The salad came out and we made a mistake in not inspecting the cutlery when we unwrapped them. Imagine our surprise/disgust when you take a bite of your salad and find some glob of brown, stuck on goo on your fork. The fork that was in your food... and in your mouth. Set the fork aside and wait for our server. She walks up and we start to ask for a new fork. Without missing a step or stopping to acknowledge what was being said, she grabs the fork and continues to walk away. We never even finished ""could we please have...""  Ok.... in the mean time, someone else brings our food. She comes back and takes the salad bowl and asks if we need anything during her flyby.  We asked for no avocado because of an allergy. When we asked for it, we paused and waited for acknowledgement because it's important. Not to be difficult.  At this point, not really surprised to find avocado in the food.  We want to believe that maybe it's just an oversight as it's been communicated to several people that avocado is not wanted. So we put it on a napkin and set it aside.  ""Would you like more tea?"" Sure! I think I'm behind on my water consumption for the day. Surprisingly, the refill on the tea is dark. Completely changes the color of a glass that was still over half full. Dark, actual tea. No comment on the watery glass brought originally.  ""Did you get your salad?"" I guess she didn't remember bringing or removing it from our table.  We just want to leave. The avocado is removed with comment.  The Burger was good. The experience was awful.  ""Do you want dessert?""  No. Please.  This was 2 hours past lunch rush. Our section was pretty empty. We paid our bill plus 15%.  It was a beautiful day during the week. We left feeling dejected.

This past week and a half I've had two awful experiences with BJ's at the Coddingtown Mall, hence the 1 star. Two Fridays ago, my boyfriend and I went into the bar around 6:00pm. We each got a beer and ordered two appetizers--the lettuce wraps and chicken wings. The bar/restaurant was not busy with plenty of open tables. We waited 45 minutes for two appetizers... The server did not apologize or offer any kind of comp. I have worked in the restaurant industry and decided not to complain. The food came out warm and was yummy. The following Wednesday my company ordered BJ's catering for a meeting of 20 people. We had never used BJ's catering and decided to give it a whirl. When I went to pick it up, they had no record of our order. I waited for 40 minutes, then raced back to the office in order to set up lunch. When I opened the catered dishes, the amount of food was ridiculous for the price. For instance take the Barbacoa Chicken--half pan which is $45 and supposed to serve 5-10 people. There were TWO chicken breasts! $45 for 2 chicken breasts?? WTF?! I called and spoke to the GM. I told him about our experience and he apologized--but that was it. Legitimately, you pay $45 for 2 chicken breasts. WOW.  We are a large company and have meals catered all the time.

Hostess was too busy flipping her hair and flirting with a server to acknowledge when we walked in. We were seated all the way back in the corner, which was fine other than the fact we were next to an order input station so the servers kept huddling around there. My son's burger wasn't cooked right, he didn't care. He's a teenager, he eats just about anything.

Went last night, ordered drinks, my wife received a strawberry lemonade vs a Lynchberg Lemonade which we'd ordered. No big deal, so we ordered dinner, which was very good, and at the same time we ordered dinner we ordered my daughter the mini pazooki (sp?) off the kids menu. After we'd been done eating for some time and were left just sitting there we flagged the young lady and asked about the desert, no problem she said. We continued to wait, and wait, and wait. I ended up flagging her down again and politely said we'd hold off on the desert, asked for the check please. So we got the check and an apology, that she didn't know why it was taking so long. Review the check, we were charged for the appetizer that per their current promotion was supposed to be free, which the young lady apologized for and corrected. Then we found we were charged for the strawberry lemonade which wasn't ordered nor consumed.

We returned it, asking for chips that weren't dripping in oil. The second plate was half the size of the first for some reason, and it didn't look much better. There was a sad bowl of watered down queso with zero flavor. The chicken fried steak burger came with an over-cooked fried egg, burned chicken fried steak, and no gravy. Not a single drop. Fries were soggy with grease. The lemon thyme chicken was lacking lemon and thyme.  Service: Slightly redeeming, as their waitstaff were attentive, keeping glasses refilled.  Cost: Three entrees, two apps, and four iced teas ran us $65 and change.  Overall: The menu is like a book, and the variety means they don't do anything well. Just loads of less than mediocre food at some high prices. Zero ambience inside, and the ladies room was in dire need of cleaning. Note: We were there at the slow time of the day, around 3:30pm.

Fortunately she didn't eat it and need a trip to the emergency department. I returned to the store and spoke to the on duty manager, Ali, who left me with an unconcerned so what attitude. She had the opportunity to right a wrong but obviously lacks the training or experience to do so.

66,Shawn F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",21,5,3.0,1.0,2017-08-23,"I went to this restaurant with my parents and girlfriend for an early birthday dinner for my girlfriend. If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would in a heartbeat. This was probably my worst experience at any restaurant in my 23 years of life. We started off great with our waitress who seemed very sharp and on-top of everything; getting out drinks on time, and checking in on us. The issues began when we ordered and received our food. My girlfriend is allergic to cilantro and she looked at the selection of tacos on the menu and noticed the salmon tacos not listing cilantro as being one of the ingredients to them, whereas the other three taco items did list it. She received her tacos with tons of cilantro on it. So much that it was impossible to get all of it off. The waitress came back out five minutes later and we all told her that the salmon tacos doesn't have cilantro listed as an ingredient which she agreed and said that it shouldn't have been on the item in the first place. She took it back and said she'll make sure the item doesn't have any cilantro on the new batch. Sometime later she came back with the salmon tacos and it all looked fine, no cilantro in sight. I had to get to work, so my girlfriend and I left right after we got her item. Now, it is partially our fault for not checking every nook and cranny for cilantro, but just like the waitress said to begin with, cilantro should not be on these tacos in the first place. I got to work and saw a message from my girlfriend with some photos attached with what else but, you guessed it, cilantro. It's a good thing that she checked every section of the tacos or else she would have been in trouble. I'll attach the photos to the review, but what it looks like and from her description is that the cilantro was underneath everything else, sort of looking like they tried to hide it. The reason why I say ""hide it"" is because the last salmon tacos they had brought out had cilantro on top of everything else. I'm not saying they did this intentionally, but when someone tells you they have an allergic reaction to a certain ingredient; you best not put that item on their order. What if she had not checked and taken a bite of it? That is just sickening that a big chain like BJ's would do this and I highly suggest you change your ways in how you manage your establishment in Santa Rosa, CA because you would think they would know better. Oh, and I'm not done there. When I told my parents that cilantro was still on the tacos, they went back to talk to a manager. They spoke to the duty manager, Ali who honestly couldn't care less. I don't know if this was just an inexperienced manager or not, but something as serious as someone being allergic to an item and having the item still be on the food they ordered could be a serious lawsuit if that person ended up eating this food. I had hoped for a better response from a manager at a chain restaurant and I also hope the higher up manager and/or owner of the location in Santa Rosa, CA takes a look at this review because this could have been a VERY serious issue if someone consumed food they were allergic to without knowing. This isn't a ""not-so-serious"" issue like you guys getting my drink order wrong, instead it's something that could pose a threat to someone's life. Please get some quality control in your establishment BJ's because you can seriously injure someone if you continue your ways.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=60,2.08,2.2,2.372,2.244,2.152

They also list the calories which is nice. The pricing is decent and the inside is beautiful. My only complaint is the waiting staff and their timing. It seems that every single time I come, no matter my waiter/waitress, they cannot have my appetizer/meal come at a time that is appropriate. Either they forget my appetizer entirely, or it comes AFTER I receive my main meal.

I ordered the rib eye rare with mash potatoes fully loaded and broccoli. When it finally arrived I had a baked potato, broccoli and my steak. In my thoughts no big deal it's a potato but as soon as I cut my rib eye I was very disappointed, WELL DONE!!!!!! So the only thing on my plate that was right was my broccoli. I did not eat my rib eye at all, very disappointed. Unfortunately we had big group the waitress did her best but not once did anyone ask me how my food was. It should raise a flag when a full rib eye steak does not get eaten. How does RARE turn to WELL DONE. Fortunately for me I will never go back to this location. ******Update, as soon as I posted this review, the General Manager for the restaurant reached and out and made the experience right, great way to show the customer focus, thank you Pedro for that and just for the thoughts 5 stars.

We had calamari as an appetizer and it was chewing, cold and majorly greasy. After complaining and being told it would come off our bill they never removed it.

My Cobb salad arrived without the avocado. After 10 minutes of trying to get our server 's attention, she finally came over. When I asked about the avocado, she argued with me.  She was sure that it was not on the menu. Our stack of menus were still on the table (she never bothered to pick them up) so I showed her. So, she said she would go ask the kitchen. After she left, I noticed that I did not have Any dressing in my salad. By this point, the experience was ruined. While BJ's has a reputation for large servings, this was not the case with  the Cobb salad.  There were a total of four bites worth of chicken, and about two tablespoons of bacon.  Skimpy for a $14 salad.

89,Catherine W.,"San Rafael, CA",39,122,28.0,3.0,2017-12-01,"You, know, after seeing the 2.5 star reviews here, I can make a case for ""categories"" of restaurants. BJ's is NOT the place you want to take someone you want to make a positive impression on (like, the first time you take your girl's parents out, or something, unless this already happens to be their favorite restaurant). However, if you are looking for a casual place for some beer, some conversation, a meeting place to watch the game or an all out, guilty pleasure place to imbibe in some drink and bar food - this is your place! We come here when we have the craving for some comfort food and a pizookie (dessert). Rarely does this place disappoint. Is the waitstaff super attentive and ready with suggestions and always there when you water needs filling? To be honest, not really. Does the bartender know every drink in the book and then some, when you need just that sumpin, sumpin special? No, don't think so. However, if you know what you want, a burger, a huge salad or basic, filling appy's, this is your place! We love the food here, for what it is - don't come here on watching your weight, come for some American fare, a little greasy in places, very filling and satisfyingly delicious, if nothing fancy American fare is what you want. At night, the place is a bit, dark, but the better to watch the game on the huge big screen TV's all scattered about the place.  As mentioned before, the waitstaff does a journeyman's job, but again, but if you ask them for water as they are whizzing by, they willingly accommodate. One night we came and found several single diners (one person only), so if that is something you do, you can dine in privacy. Our favorites - anything on the appetizer list, a huge salad (or a small beet salad), a big burger or pasta dish. I usually have an appetizer and the hubby usually goes for an entree. For lunch, I have had a big salad, shared it with a friend and a beer is just right! For dessert, pizookie is the thing! A play on words (combination of a cookie and a pizza) you get a soft serve cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream! We usually get the ice cream on the side - it is eaten with a spoon, and again - not a diet item, not even a little bit! For variety, you can order three mini pizookies at a time, each topped with a ""scooplet"" of ice cream. The cookie would seem to be made with a bit of flour to hold it together, a whole lotta sugar and a whole lotta butter! It is really good, but again, it has to be the kind of thing you want... In the end, you really won't leave in need of another meal easily until morning.  As a family, when you have one of those nights where cooking is not a possibility, but if you are hungry AF and you NEED to have some FOOD, come here. If you are with friends and it's kinda late and you have the munchies, come here! If your house is a mess, but you want to watch the game with friends, come here! We like BJ's just fine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3,3.36,2.84,2.528,1.9000000000000001,3.048
79,Jill D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",90,14,,1.0,2017-12-02,Went to have dinner and a drink or two at the bar last Thursday night. Bartenders are quick to get you a drink after ordering it but it took more than an hour and 20 minutes to receive food after ordering it. Bartender never apologized for the long wait or asked how our dinner was. Food was mediocre at best. I think their only concern is serving as many drinks as they can to you. There was a couple next to us that should not have been served any more drinks as they were extremely intoxicated. Perhaps ABC needs to get involved and bring decoys in to investigate.

I knew it was fishy tasting and not very good tonight (it's normally my favorite thing here). I've eaten here plenty of times and been just fine but now I have food poisoning.  To top it off our waitress was terrible. She brought us a plastic spoon for my husband's soup because apparently they don't have a dishwasher or enough silverware. It was not even half full of people so I don't know how you run out of spoons. We ordered 3 appetizers but my husband's entree somehow came out first and it took at least 30 minutes for the other food to come out (even though you don't have to cook poke).  Once the waitress, dark short spikey hair, came out with the rest of our food she announces they don't have anymore wonton chips and then stares blankly at me, my dish in her hand, like I'm supposed to tell her what to do. I then ask ""how am I supposed to eat the ahi without the chips?"" And she continues to stare at me like she had forgotten completely who she even was and says ""I don't know."" She continues to stare at me. Hello? Is anyone home in there? I was hoping she'd offer an alternative but she didn't just stood there starting at me in silence. I gave up and just said it was fine I'll use a fork. She then left us and didn't return until our plates were nearly empty asking if we wanted dessert - at this point, yeah right.  She did offer to remove one of our appetizers off our bill so at least we know the lights aren't on with no one home.  Regardless, I expect that if I'm paying $10 per app and $20 per entree that the place has an adequate amount of silverware and waitresses that know how to do their job. Also I don't expect to get freaking food poisoning.

60,Spencer C.,"Petaluma, CA",3,27,4.0,2.0,2017-12-13,"We went here last night for a birthday dinner with party of nine. They were very put out by this. Took over an hour for first food to hit the table. By the time dinner and dessert was done we were there over 2 1/2 hours. With one server and the kitchen about a mile away, the first person in our group was done eating by the time the ninth received their food. They were very understaffed. The staff they did have seemed really stressed out. Food was okay, not great. Wife's salad had little to no dressing. Asking server for more of anything seemed like we were putting him out if we could find him. Overall corporate America at its best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=60,2.28,2.71,2.472,,2.5380000000000003
125,Ellen P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,2.0,2017-12-14,"We have been to BJ's multiple times since they opened. We have always had an issue with at least one item. The last time I was there before last night, my lunch was so bad that it was not even edible. I lost my appetite, it was so bad. Manager comped my lunch. I swore I would never go back but my granddaughter wanted steak and it was too far of a drive to get to our steakhouse of choice. So off we went to BJ's. She ordered the top sirloin steak dinner. It came with a Caesar salad.....it was terrible. Soggy and wilted, maybe 6 croutons, and we had to ask for extra dressing. Then her steak arrived. It was blackened on the outside and raw inside. I am sure the mashed potatoes were instant....so gummy. We had our waiter get the manager, so he offered us another steak medium well, which is what I had originally ordered. It took 20 mins and arrived well done. She ate it because she was so hungry. Manager comped the meal. Then there were my Avocado egg rolls. I usually love these but not last nite, overly cooked and the pieces or avocado were brown and mushy. Terrible. But I let it go. About 10 mins later, a customer behind us had the manger come over because his pork chop was raw! Serious?  I am DONE...never ever going back. The manager named Jake was super nice but they desperately need to evaluate their food....and turn down the loudness. We could hardly hear each other. A let down for what could have been a great time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=120,2.32,2.71,2.468,,2.5540000000000003

Although the place was packed, we were greeted immediately and ordered our drinks. Justin, our server made it seem like we were the only table he had. He he was attentive and on top of everything; getting our food to us quickly, Refilling drinks etc. we were kind of sad when we got to BJs.

148,m b.,"Rohnert Park, CA",41,9,1.0,2.0,2017-12-18,I went there tonight Monday...because my 11 year old Foster Son picked the resturant for his Birthday dinner.  The food was good.  I had told the waitress it was his birthday right when we were ordering..she seemed a little put out when i changed my french fries to the sweet potato fries.  She told me how it was a pain to go back into this tablet she had to change an order. Then when she came back I told her again it was his birthday and she wasnt really even acknowledging it.  Then when we were done eating we were waiting for her return which was quite a while..We played hangman..i was trying to keep an 11 year old busy. When she arrived back she gave me the bill and again i had to tell her it was his birthday..by then i was upset at her service...she said oh does he want this certin desert and im all yes thats fine..thinking dont you already have it ready and shouldnt you have it right now ? So then we waited like 20 more minutes.  I saw her an called her over to the table finally and said you know i am very disappointed in your service we are leaving ...he never got the happy birthday resturant experience. ....pretty sad....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=100,2.4,2.78,2.484,,2.628

The service was ok but not the best when we got our appetizer we didn't even get plates to share so I hate to eat of the appetizer plate.

This has been the 3rd time in a row going to Bj's where the service isn't good and the food is even worse. I keep trying to give it a chance thinking maybe this time it will be better, but it never is. Went with a friend yesterday who got a prime rib dip that was all fat and completely greasy, and I got a bowl of COLD tomato soup. I just don't understand how this place is still in business honestly. We should have went to Denny's...or Jack in the box nearby. Anything is better than BJ's...someone is running this place into the ground. Please, get new staff and hire some chefs that actually know how to cook or else you're going to lose your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3,2.4,2.76,2.468,,2.616

So not worth it. $17 for a small 6 slice pizza that's not quite as good as Tombstone frozen pizza. Almost $7 for a local Ca craft brew when I can go to Russian River and have the real thing for $5 a pint, No thanks. Not to mention the awful service. Needless to say I won't be going back.

42,Todd S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,27,2.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"We continue to give this place a chance but the service and food are never consistent. It's like gambling when you go here. Last night was a perfect example. Wasn't that busy and got seated right away. Wife ordered the calamari to start. As this is usually always cooked perfectly. Four minutes after ordering the waiter comes out with calamari. No way it was cooked that fast especially since it was warm, not hot and it was rubbery. Must of been sitting from a another persons order. The waiter was great and had it taken off. His overall service was very attentive and great until the end. The rest of the food comes for dinner except the the food servers forgot to bring for my wife's soup. One of the kids sides don't come as ""they were still cooking the fries"" but the other kids meal had the fries. ??? After we tell the waiter he said no problem he goes and gets both and then five minutes later one of the food servers shows up with the bowl soup. Poor communication and organization. Not a big deal at this point with the appetizer being taking off so we weren't  to much to be upset with everything. The rest of the food was hot and fresh.  He brings the  to go boxes and the bill. I expect to be out of here pretty quick at this point right. Wrong!!! I put my credit card in the bill fold and stand it up for the waiter grab it. We proceed to spend 15 more minutes watching him walk past us 8 times and touch base with all his other tables while ignoring us. I walk up to the hostess to asked to pay my bill upfront. She says oh you're waiter will takes care of that. I tell her I've been waiting for 15 minutes. She goes on to say I will let him know know go ahead and sit down he will be right there. I wait five more minutes he walks by two more times and I finally have to hand him the bill as he's walking away for me. Very rude and a poor way to end the night. Like I said you never know what you're going to get here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=80,2.12,2.77,2.452,,2.5100000000000002
49,Emily L.,"Alameda, CA",1,16,,1.0,2017-12-28,Both times I've been here it was a very subpar experience but when we went for lunch today it was really bad. The waitress was clearly very flustered but rather than making an effort to improve her service she just kept apologizing which slowly lost weight as things got worse and worse throughout the meal. We had young children with us and not only did our food take a very long time but the kids were served about 10 minutes after the adults and my sons food seemed like it sat for a while since his fries were cold by the time the plate got to us. We had to ask three different people for condiments because it took her about 20 minutes to bring vinegar for my dads fish and chips. I had to ask twice for boxes for our food to go. We probably spent well over an hour there and by the end we just wanted to get out of there but had to be direct about it since e writhing took forever. I have lots of compassion as I've worked in food service before but this was beyond horrible. It's too bad because we love BJs but this location is really lacking in many ways.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-santa-rosa-3?start=80,2.12,2.75,2.448,,2.498

Finally, i guess someone from the kitchen brought our food. Her's was missing the potatoes and mine had no butter or syrup and was cold.

Cons...floors are very dirty (food stepped on and napkins on the floor under tables), menus sticky and my spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles was less than Stella.  The flavor of the noodles is great but the broccoli the accompanied it was an obvious afterthought as they had were barely cooked and had no flavor. There were about 4 little pieces of chicken in the dish.
