0,Ben W.,"Cheshunt, United Kingdom",7,82,64.0,3.0,2013-03-10,"This is a fun place to eat. My two young girls always enjoy eating hear as there is loud music and a fun atmosphere. This place is also plastered wall to wall (and some parts of the ceilingI with pictures, photos, skateboards, surfboards, guitars etc. etc. The food is tasty american style food with various themes to it. This place has a massive well stocked bar that you can sit and have a few drinks at either before or after your meal. Service is good. The staff go out of your way to make you comfortable. This place can get very packed out at the weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-3,,,,,
2,M S.,"London, United Kingdom",0,7,,1.0,2016-08-28,Very poor standards. The last 2 times i went it was a dirty mess with lazy waiter/waitresses. Dirty tables would be left for ages!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-3,,,,,
1,Grace G.,"Oslo, Norway",0,6,,2.0,2016-10-28,"I would be giving this place only one star if it weren't for the fact that this place was very crowded when I went to eat, however it is hit and miss when it comes to finding good T.G.I Friday's, and this certainly isn't one of them. I will start with the perks: My friend, and my mother (who had the same meal) enjoyed their main course. Also, we shared some cheese and bacon potato skins and they were lovely. But that's it. Now for the downsides: *We had to wait an hour for our main course! Jesus Christ!  *When out food finally arrived, my pasta tasted strange, like they'd put sauce on it when I specifically asked them not to. My dad found his food disgusting aswell! *Finally, (although this was most likely due to being overworked), our server was rushing everything and got a lot wrong. We spoke to the manager and explained to him that our waiting/waiter experience wasn't our waiters fault and that he was being overworked. To top it all off the toilet had no toilet paper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-enfield-3,,,,,
