This was by far the worst. I hope it was just a fluke but it is hard to say. They messed up my burger, my wife's burger and the kids burger for one of my kids came out as a chicken sandwich. Plus the coke was flat!  Yes, I told the manager(politely) when he came and asked and he gave us a couple coupons for a free burger.

Well, my girlfriends and I ventured out to brave the newest restaurant in Lubbock.  We did have to wait but for only twenty minutes, and the people that walked out seemed very pleased. When we got seated we were greeted by a lovely server who made our first experience delightful. The burgers were wonderful, and the few drinks we got were worth the price. The atmosphere was very casual and with the dinner rush it didn't seem tense or claustrophobic as newer restaurants tend to be. I will definitely be returning when I am craving a burger and a cocktail!

50,Leo S.,"Dallas, TX",15,127,130.0,4.0,2014-05-25,"Yesterday was my first time to visit Red Robin in Lubbock Texas. I currently live in Dallas Texas where the Red Robin prominent. Being originally from Lubbock I'm glad to see more restaurants like this especially when the service is outstanding. As I went to this restaurant I was greeted very professionally and with high enthusiasm. After waiting a short time, I was sat in the back section with the server by the name of Cody G. It wasn't long before Cody came to our table even though the restaurant was highly crowded. He took our order for drinks and offered us a cocktail. We did take him up on a few the specialty drinks I can't remember the name of mine but it had agave tequila in it and was a martini.  We then placed our order for the main entree. I ordered a new burger which I have not tried before I believe it's called The Royal with an egg on top. After I order was placed we were checked on several times to make sure that our drinks were at a level that was satisfactory to us. Our food was delivered promptly and hot. We enjoyed our meal then we got our check only after being offered dessert. Due to the amount of food that we ate prior to being offered dessert there was no way we were going to be able to eat dessert. We paid our check we then left and I can honestly say I was completely satisfied with this visit and would suggest this location to anyone.

53,Alyse S.,"Austin, TX",1,5,,2.0,2014-06-16,"Service started out bad and became worse. I don't blame her. I blame the quadruple seating of tables (2 big tops-we were a table of 10), the lack of consideration and teamwork of others, the inadequate degree of professionalism exhibited from managers, and the noticeably insufficient training across the board. The food was less than good and absolutely not worth the cost. We weren't even thanked after spending almost $300 in the establishment by the five employees chit chatting. Also, quit holding plates, glasses, etc over the head of a child when clearing or serving a table. And if your servers can't hold more than four drinks on a tray, they aren't ready for the floor. Additionally, perhaps utilizing the pivot point system at tables could help with the yelling of food orders, the missing sauces and the ridiculous ticket times because your (very quiet) food runner doesn't know where to put plates down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

26,Mel E.,"Houston, TX",330,345,1380.0,3.0,2016-03-01,"Red Robin is a popular chain restaurant and if you've never eaten at one, you gotta try it. My friends and I were in Lubbock and were surprised that there was a restaurant in town. This location seems to be very busy, many families eating here. Obviously ordering burgers are a must, but their steak fries are also delicious which comes with every burger. And not only are they delicious, they're bottomless, so you can keep on ordering fries at no extra charge, but you just need to inform your waiter when you're ready for your next batch. You can also upgrade your fries to sweet potato or garlic parm if you'd like, and they're also bottomless. Whenever I visit a Red Robin, I always treat myself to a freckled lemonade, and yes, it is bottomless too. The burgers here don't disappoint, always juicy and satisfies my hunger. My favorites are the shroom and the cheeseburger, very simple but on point. This restaurant had the standard Red Robin furniture but their bar area looks fun and trendy, very cool. I think the only downfall to my visit is the waiter, I think it may have been his first time serving a big group (12 ppl), he seemed to get rattled quickly and kept forgetting things. He had another person get our drink orders as well.

She was super friendly, and didn't even blink an eye when she saw me wiping the table, silverware and ketchup bottle down with a sanitizing wipe (It wasn't dirty, I'm just a bit of a germiphobe-I clean everything. You should see me when I have to stay in a hotel..).  Courtney was so fast to help us, even though she was waiting on the majority of tables on our side, took note of my daughter's peanut allergy and made sure the guys preparing the food knew as well. She checked with us often, made sure we always had drinks, napkins (we had kids with us, so a constant necessity!), anything we needed. We ordered a lot, and our food was out quickly! Service was amazing! I could hear her with the other tables, and she was so nice to everyone, and fast! Even the manager, Patrick, was going around to the tables greeting people, and making sure customers were happy with their food, service, etc. I have only seen managers and chefs do that at expensive restaurants, so that's amazing. It definitely didn't feel like we were eating at a usual fast food joint. My husband had the fish basket, which you wouldn't think would be good at a burger place, but it was great! I had the onion ring stack, which was yummy-crunchy and not over-salted. The milk shakes are super sweet and the vanilla tasted almost like birthday cake-so good. We also had the bottomless rootbeer float, and I had a burger (can't remember the name); it had mushrooms, onion straws and an onion bun. It tastes so good, especially paired up with their Mai Tai, which is the best I have had at a chain restaurant (of course, there is nothing like making your own-maybe just because I double the booze..). Too often mixed drinks taste like powder mix, but this one was sweet and packed a punch. We ordered two kids meals; the chicken tenders were good, they didn't look like the frozen and shaped tenders you find elsewhere; and a kids burger; they give you the option of a beef or turkey patty, both with bottomless fries, bottomless root beer float, 2 kids milk shakes, a fish basket, onion ring stack, chili cheese fries, my onion burger and Mai Tai and the bill came out to about $70.  They have a few big screens, you can sit close to them or not.  Great service, great experience. The place was clean and updated, no food/fries littering the floor (yes, I was looking), even though it was right after the lunch rush. They also have a few parking spots right by the door that are designated for pickup; you can call in an order and pick it up there.

At first once seated, we were ignored briefly before the manager walked by and took care of that situation. Our waitress came and introduced herself and did an awesome job because we were a party of 7. Most of us enjoyed the yummy burgers and definitely took advantage of the bottomless fries. I opted for the sweet potatoe fries, yummy and I also ordered the Thai dipping sauce, awesome sauce!

6,Pat M.,"Midland, TX",12,57,,1.0,2016-09-21,"BF was in Lubbock yesterday on business and by phone I suggested the RR as it was close to him, and though I've never eaten in one, had vaguely heard of them for many years, that they were a burger joint and he wanted to get something quick to go and eat while driving to Midland. He said it took about 5 minutes to be waited on at the front, and it was after 2pm so was hardly anyone else in the place besides him. He told her her just wanted a jalapeño cheeseburger and a sweet tea, simple, he didn't even look at menu.   He waited and waited and waited and waited, another 25 minutes so was in there over 30 minutes to grab and burger and T to go.He paid and asked for receipt so he could get reimbursed by company and the lady said it was at bottom of bag. The bill for the burger and T was whopping over $14. And the receipt wasn't in the bag. So he didn't get reimbursed. What a rip-off and a waste of time. He didn't eat even half the burger and just one of the fries, didn't like them much and gave the rest to his dog when he got home. I felt awful for recommending the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

7,James O.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-27,"I was there last night (11/26/16) at about 9:30pm. The restaurant had maybe 10-15 guest. We were promptly seated in a booth we wanted. A server came to welcome us after about 6 minutes after we sat and took our drink orders....very simple a coffee, water with lemons, and diet Coke. We and another table of 6 were the only ones sitting in the bar area....I'm guessing he went to cut up the lemons himself or drove to United to buy some but, he took a while to come back with the drinks. When he did arrive he then took our order; the Firey Ghost Burger w/ steak fries & campfire sauce, and a dessert to be served when the burger was about half eaten. We've been in the restaurant for about 20 minutes at this point. When he put the order in that was the last time we saw him. We sat and talked for about 15 minutes and I finally got up and walked to where the kitchen is to find my server and a few others laughing, talking, just cutting up having a great time. I asked ""what's taking so long....where's the urgency to get it out the window."" It's hamburger meat....the place is close to closing and I've  cooked hamburger meat myself and know it doesn't take 15 minutes to cook 1 fucking burger. We then walked out the door for t he last time and they where taking the food out....walked right over to BJ's ate there and got free dessert for the terrible service we had at Red Robin. We spent more money and had better service there....they were even busier than the burger joint and people had smiles eating steak and potatoes at 11pm.   To all servers that read this....do treat your last table as if it's your first one and to restaurant owners/mangers Lubbock has several to choose from...hell how many places in Lubbock can ya eat at?? Texas Land & Cattle is closed, Buffalo Burgers is closed....etc catch my drift?? I was  really excited when Red Robin opened here.... now I don't give a fuck...will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

So we decided on the chili cheese fries as an appetizer and we're asked if we needed more time to make our order for our main course.  We received 4 burgers and 2 fries and even received refills, our waitress or the bartender tried to insist  on giving us the check, like we were inconveniencing her and I asked her to make sure the chili cheese fries were not on our order. Then there's the bottomless fries offer I've been to red Robin 6 times here in Lubbock and never once been asked if I want more.
