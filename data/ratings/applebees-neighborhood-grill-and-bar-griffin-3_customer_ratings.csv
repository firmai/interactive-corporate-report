3,Ray Q.,"Hampton, GA",41,148,356.0,3.0,2012-07-08,Come early especially on Fridays and weekends expect long waits at those times 8-10pm. The 2 for $20 option is always a great value.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
7,Keith G.,"Carrollton, TX",10,10,,4.0,2013-01-02,"Okay... this is really just your typical Applebee's. But in Griffin, it's among the best choices. Decent and predictable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
8,Mallory W.,"Hampton, GA",33,19,,4.0,2013-05-23,I love this applebees. I won't and say that I'm always given the best service but they really have the best cooked and tasty food of all the applebees in a 20 mile radius. It's be even better if the half price appetizers weren't cut back to just a few items,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
9,J H.,"Stockbridge, GA",1,24,1.0,1.0,2013-07-04,The food and service at this Applebee's has never been all that great. But my last visit proved to be the worst. It took over 15 minutes to get the drinks and it went downhill from there. The food was sub-par and one of the drink glasses had some sort of red syrup all over it which promptly dripped all over the table. (aka: NOT CLEAN!) That was final straw and I vowed never to go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
5,Amber J.,"Griffin, GA",1,16,14.0,3.0,2014-11-02,"They've went downhill. I only gave them 3 stars because I love their cheese sticks. The service is slow and I truly believe that they recycle old food. I ordered cheese sticks , why did my sauce a French fry in it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
4,Chris B.,"Griffin, GA",0,5,,1.0,2015-08-19,Don't go here horrible  service. They messed up our order and didn't even bring 2 of the people in our party there food. 2 people in the party ordered the pick five apps. But we're charged for the full size app and the apps were the pick 5 size. We talked to the manager and she said she would take care of it. When we got the check we were charged for everything even the food we didn't receive. After talking to the manager again they finally got the bill correct. I am just giving a brief description of what happened it was a real bad experience. I will never eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
2,Keanna S.,"Hampton, GA",0,11,3.0,1.0,2016-02-17,"Started out bad hostess Irene didn't greet us with a smile or a hello! Just a how many? Is a table ok? I didn't care but, my husband thought a booth would be better with a 3 year old( like most ppl) she looked at us waited without a ok or anything. Then curtly said this way. Sat us didn't ask if we wanted a booster seat or anything. The rest of the meal was uneventful I ordered a burger only ate half of it.... My husband order some chicken dish with jalapeños and his food came out looking nothing like a the picture just chiCken breast with mash potatoes that had cheese no jalapeños. He told the server that he didn't want the dish she didn't ask why or offer something more. She just took the plate! The only person that enjoyed was my daughter she like the crayons! Needless to say would NEVER be back at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
6,Melissa H.,"Griffin, GA",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-03-06,"Would love to review our food, but we never got a chance to eat it. Tried ordering the Chicken wonton tacos and were told they were out of shells. Overheard table next to us they had waited an hour and still not received their food. After hearing that and not getting what we wanted to order, we left. Tread lightly people. I would give no stars if I had the option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
0,Kelly T.,"Greenville, SC",679,465,1424.0,3.0,2016-06-13,"Honestly, I give the food 5 stars. It was perfectly prepared and delicious, and the portions were huge. Very good. My compliments to the kitchen staff. The host/manager was very friendly and we were seated immediately. He even held the chair out for my mom, who is a bit slow and uses a cane.  After sitting at our table for 5-10 minutes and being passed by numerous servers, I asked the hostess if a server had been assigned to our table. She said she'd check, and I told my mom we'd give them 5 more minutes then we'd go somewhere else. Within 2 minutes two servers showed up, one of which was being trained, which I thought was odd on a Friday night (trial by fire?) After that, the service was great - fast and very friendly. I hesitate to give more than 3 stars just because it wouldn't be the first place I'd return to if given a choice. I do wish this particular location could be updated inside, as it appears it hasn't been since I left Griffin over 15 years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
1,Dana D.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,14,,1.0,2017-10-11,"This Applebee's location is the absolute worst!! Was there this past Friday for some drinks and appetizers. The first thing we ordered was the $1 margaritas. They were not good. Couldn't drink them. The evening shift bartender came into work about 5 minutes after we got there. She was freaking out and angry from the second she walked in. There was 5 guests at the bar and a lady waiting on a to go order and the restaurant itself was super slow but she freaking out like she was so busy she couldn't do anything else. We asked her if we could order food and she asked us to hold on. Then she was kind of mad bc we didn't like the margaritas. When we finally ordered it took over 30 min to get an order of wonton tacos and sweet potato fries. When they finally came out they were cold and soggy. Someone with me asked for some ketchup. The bartender said ""we may not have any"" then immediately brought a ketchup bottle over. She was acting like she was so busy and flustered yet she had plenty of time to stand around and complain about how much she hated her job and everything that has happened the night before. Every employee we saw that day was complaining about their job. I heard two employees standing close to the bar talking about the night before and cursing really loud. If you want to complain about your job then don't do it in front of customers. When we asked for our check the bartender was in the middle of telling a heated story about the night before she was literally banging her fist on the bar. It was very uncomfortable. When we went to leave one of the servers that I heard cursing earlier was standing at the host station texting. Customers were walking out of the restaurant and she wasn't saying a word to them. Just standing there texting. This place is absolutely terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-griffin-3,,,,,
