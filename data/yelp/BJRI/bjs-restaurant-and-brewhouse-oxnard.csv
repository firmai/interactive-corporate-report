Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",188,425,2602,5.0,10/28/2017,"Quick and easy! We were hungry. We arrived around 2:30pm on a Friday. The Lunch menu is valid until 3pm, Monday- Friday, so I took advantage of it and ordered the  Lemon Thyme  chicken over rice, brussel sprouts, tomatoes and more. ( $11.95) This was perfectly cooked and tender.The overall flavors of this dish was perfect. I could of ordered another one, but refrained.  My friend ordered 2 grilled fish tacos which come with guacamole and salsa. She loved her fish tacos and salsa, but the guacamole was runny, and liquid like and tasted like it came out of a can.  For dessert we ordered their famous pizookie! It is a cookie baked in a baking pan with an ice cream scoop on to. We loved the salted caramel which is quite sweet and sprinkled with tiny chococlate chips.We couldn't finish it, but that was fine. Right now, these are only $3.00!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
Amanda J.,"North Las Vegas, NV",44,2,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Put name on wait list on line for 6 people when we arrived we requested accommodations for an additional peraon who had decided to join us. Our wait time jumped up to an hour and a half. A group of 5 people arrived after us and was told they had a 15 minute wait time. I walked the dining room and noted an empty table for 8, large corner both (accommodate maybe 5-6) a table for 8, several booths that could fit 4 and a few other free tables. I asked to speak with the manager and when she arrived her demeanor was ""don't care"" from the start. Colletta, the dining room manager told me our time increased because we changed the number in out party.  A number that was 2 more than the party that arrived after us, a number that was one greater than the original request,  a number that could easily had been accommodated based on the available tables vs. Patrons waiting in the dining room (us and the party of 5....)  When I asked how this is was possible when I observed many empty tables in the dining room Coletta met me with disdain and attitude. I was completely floored by her unwillingness to concede that ONE PERSON MORE should not have prohibited us from being seated in a dining room that wasn't packed.  She was rude, I told her she was rude and requested her DM's contact info.  She was quite smug when walking away to receive it. Fortunately we received much better service down the road at Lazy Dogs.  It's not so much that the time increased but it was Coletta's demeanor , that's what really angered me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
Omar D.,"Oak View, CA",30,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Was expecting a better experience, but unfortunately my food was dropped and I had to wait even longer then I already did initially. The waitress (Tina Marie B.) told me the manager was going to come over and speak with me, but he never made it my way so I feel like the manager nor the waitress cared enough to check up on me. If the manager had come by to speak with me like I was told it could've changed my experience tonight (11/26/17) but like I stated before nobody came by to speak with me. If I could I wouldn't even give BJ's a star. I wouldn't give it any type of acknowledgment because that would imply that I enjoyed my experience today even the slightest bit, but I didn't. Disappointed customer who won't be coming back. Key Note: I wasn't upset that my food wasn't free, but I'm upset with the fact that I had to wait while my table was enjoying their food and I wasn't compensated in ANY way, shape, or form.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4425,2439,5445,3.0,12/25/2017,BJ's as a major chain is very mainstream in that their menu is safe and you will have a satisfying meal no matter what you order. Their chocolate cookie dessert is really yummy though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",289,180,569,3.0,8/15/2017,"My husband & I are Whole Foods-Plant Based. The easiest to describe this to someone who doesn't know what that means is to say we are vegan & do not eat refined sugars, flours or use much oil in our foods.  When we go out, we look at the obvious dishes that are vegetarian & look at how we can make it vegan (omitting cheese, butter or eggs). Salads, chips with salsa or guacamole, pizza minus the meat & cheese, veggie burgers or just ordering sides as entrées is an option.  Prefacing our order, I told the waitress we were vegan. I asked if the avocado egg rolls, had any dairy & found out that there is cream cheese in the mixture, which is pre-made. So, there was no way to order them without cream cheese. We ordered the ""vegetarian pizza"", minus the cheese. The mushrooms & olives that come with it, to be placed on only half of the pizza, as my husband hates them & I love them.  My nephew had the kids personal pan pepperoni pizza.  We ordered the chips & guacamole.  The chips & guacamole came quickly. I was hungry & so was my husband, so we attacked that appetizer. I thought it was just me, but the guac was very bland. They served a very small container of salsa, and I kept mixing the guac with it. I told my husband, ""Is it me or is this guac very bland?"" He said its bland. He tips the bowl over & said, ""There is no tomato, garlic, jalapeño, cilantro or lime. It's just a smashed avocado in this bowl!"" I shook my head.  Guacamole isn't very hard to make. It doesn't require culinary genius. It's literally mash up of a few simple ingredients. Even a college student in a dorm room can do that. I looked at him & told him not to bother complaining. So we decided we'll just wait for the pizza.  My nephew got his kids pizza first. He loved it & said it was delicious. We waited a few more minutes & finally got ours only to find that THERE WAS CHEESE ALL OVER IT!!! The very first request we made was ignored. I think the staff needs to be educated as to what veganism is.  We let the server know that ours was with no cheese. He quickly took it back. The waitress didn't come to our table right away to apologize for it until a later. She stated that they did make a mistake & it had a rush on it.  We finally did receive our pizza, it had no cheese (hooray!), but it did have the olives & mushrooms all over. We decided not to say anything as we were starving. I told my husband we would just pick off the mushrooms & olives for him & I'd take them. Later when we got our check, the waitress informed us that they took the pizza off our bill because of the mistakes they made. And we appreciate that.  I've been a patron of this restaurant for however long it's been here in Oxnard, which is about 15 years. I have had many great meals, fun times, awesome drinks & even had a couple of birthday parties here. I have always had great service & the staff has always been very friendly & nice, so I won't stop coming here. They make an effort to make right, what mistakes they have made, but I will say this, in some respects the overall service has declined at BJs & not just at this location, a few weird things have happened at the Thousand Oaks/Westake location as well. I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at that BJs, and was disappointed by a few things. I will post my review for them under that stores Yelp page at another time.  The best thing to do to make sure any restaurant gets your order done correctly is to ask the waitress/waiter to read the order back to you to prevent mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
Serena W.,"Oxnard, CA",3,22,7,4.0,1/13/2018,"I am huge fan of the new tavern pizza's!  However, everything I've eaten from BJ's and the BEER is great!  Sometimes service isn't the best, but never terrible, that's why I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars.  The chicken parmesean is good, the breakfast menu is tasty, especially their pancakes.  I love the loaded baked potatoes and sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard
George T.,"Camarillo, CA",36,45,177,3.0,6/4/2017,"I like Bj's but it seems this particular location has a service issue. I have been to this location twice and the service was not good. We came in and did not have to wait to be seated but that was where the fun ended. We had to wait 15+ minutes for our server to acknowledge our existence. Our server seemed that she did not want to be at work.  Luckily for us, she went on break and our new server was attentive and so much better until it was time to pay. We had to wait 15-20 minutes to cash out. Our original waitress came back and saw we were trying to pay and ignored us or it seemed to us that was the case. To be fair, it seemed our original server had to many big tables and that would be a management issue. On another note, the food was good. Our table ordered a Black and Bleu burger, sirloin steak and Salmon as well as kids pizza. Everyone enjoyed their food. I also had a wedge salad that was tasty. The beer is also good at BJ's if that's your thing.  If BJ's improves their service, I'd be happy to increase their rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard

Our food was delivered to our table really fast and they allowed us to try several of the beers before making a decision on what to order. Our waiter was super patient and helpful with recommendations and while we were waiting for our food several other people checked on our table.  I wasn't too crazy about the food, I thought the flavor was a little bland. If you get anything I recommend the avocado egg rolls.

I had a little chips and salsa to go along with my ale and was watching an amazing that went to overtime. But i don't know if it had anything to do with Ashley going on break, but as i sat at the bar after ordering my tacos, i noticed that tow other customers came and sat down and received there food...and mine wasn't there.

Brisa T.,"Santa Maria, CA",67,152,70,4.0,7/23/2017,"First time even hearing about this chain. First impression of the place brought to mind chains like Buffalo Wild Wings but without the exaggerated sports crap. Definitely geared more towards a relaxed semi-casual experience. The establishment was fairly clean however the menus came sticky. The menu had a good variety of offerings. Poultry, beef, pork, fish and even some vegetarian stuff. Craft beers, mainstays and cocktails, plenty in number. They also have a kids menu with more than 3 items. (+1) I ordered a beer sampler and was not disappointed.

The sandwiches were absolute crap. I mean a cold sandwich for $14 and it doesn't even have bacon!? Plus they just put an extremely small amount of mustard on it. I ordered a baked potato with all the fixings on it which was also horrible. And plus who puts a strip of bacon on a baked potato?  The dessert. Pshh.

Brandon M.,"Santa Paula, CA",34,105,443,2.0,9/12/2017,"I don't go out to eat often. I don't have a ton of extra money. I can't always go out with my family; but this Tuesday I came to BJ's with my family.  We ordered our food and when it came, the two steaks were not cooked as ordered. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was well done. So when the waiter finally came around, I tell him and he points out that he asked the cooks why it was cooked for so long. WTF? So you new? They knew? He takes it away, and it took so long, my family either had to let their food get cold or eat without me, so I sat there for a while twiddling my thumbs like an idiot while my family enjoyed their meal. Eventually, my steak finally showed back up and the middle was cold. Refrigerator cold. Medium-rare is supposed to be just about room temp. At this point my family was DONE eating, so I got to package up my SECOND improperly cooked steak and I didn't get to eat anything, let alone enjoy a meal with my family. At no point did I receive an apology, a free drink, not even some kind words of empathy for wasting my time and ruining my family meal. I wasted my time and spent money I can't often spend.

Anthony C.,"London, United Kingdom",3,38,15,1.0,10/27/2017,"I've came to BJs for lunch a week ago and today as well. Let's start with a week ago. Food was good. Service was iffy. Asked for another minute to order because I'm not familiar with Bjs menu. 10 minutes later before I walked out the server came back. Had to track down my server to pay so I could leave smh.  Today we went for my fiances birthday. From start to finish was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. Made sure to have our orders ready so we didn't have to wait this time. Asked for a cheeseburger and it came with no cheese, our waters were NEVER refilled once, a guest of my fiance had asked for some buffalo sauce I finished my food before the sauce came for my fiance's guest, had to ask for Ketchup THREE times. We were never checked on always had to get the waitress attention. Excuse my language but by the looks on her face she didn't give a S*** either she was having the worst day of her life or she plain out has a bad attitude. Asked for the bill. Was given the bill, then the waitress disappears ......waiting and waiting we go to the front desk front desk says we have to wait for our waitress...........front desk can clearly see we have been waiting a while and another person comes and says they can take our payments.

Michelle L.,"Oxnard, CA",835,250,2676,3.0,9/24/2016,"Every single visit I've attended here with a large party, the service is horrible for dinner time. You're better off coming here for lunch or being at the bar. Here is my breakdown of my last experience & this is why I do not recommend this bar/restaurant for service purposes: Arrived at 7:45pm & sat with a party of 15. There were 4 of us that needed to order & not one single waitress or waiter came up to us until 8:30pm. That is a solid 45 minutes of wait time including 1 of one us went up front to ask for a waitress. Ordered our drinks & food & it was not served until 9:15pm. I wish I was over exaggerating but this wasn't the first time it has happened even if we reserved for a party.  * Service: 1-2 out of 5 stars. The waitress taking our orders was yelling as if she was demanding ""going once... going twice... gone"" type of attitude. If I could recommend the tall, skinny, Caucasian girl with black glasses I would prefer her enthusiastic attitude. I get it, we're a large party, but I wish it was handled better both timing & approach were bad. One of my other visits here we had to ask for the manager & she was sweet about our request. I don't know if staffing here is always short but they do not consistently check up on their tables as much as they should. We're simple customers that just wanted to eat & go, but if you're planning to be here for a ""short dinner"" for a good hour or so, expect the wait. * Drinks/Food: Other than the service, food is always a good 4 out of 5 stars. From beer on tap to appetizers to their main entrees, the portion sizes are shareable. Is the food worth the wait? To be honest, throughout the years when BJ's first opened this was one of Oxnard's top bar/restaurants for young adults. Nowadays, the service has gone downhill since. I wouldn't say ""worth"" the wait, but this type of ""wait"" is unnecessary for customer service with us being seated already. * Ordered: - BJ's Berry Burst Cider (5/5 stars): It's for breast cancer awareness month so it's on their ""pink drink"" list! It has a good fruity taste.  - Great White deep dish, small was good for 2 (4/5 stars): I like their deep dishes here. Fulfilling dish of carbs. - Crispy Portobello strips (4/5 stars): If you love mushrooms, this one is for you! It's basically mushroom fries but with deep fried batter & ranch.  From pastas to appetizers to pizookies, it's a ""decent"" dinner. Hence the 3 stars for A-okay. Could be better if it was served on a timely manner.  Again, if you're here for happy hour or a visit in general, I've gotten way better service for lunch time & for a smaller party.

Of course, take it off the bill, but nice restaurants offer a free dessert as an apology.  Or a gift card for a free appetizer next visit.

MJ T.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,23,63,5.0,2/28/2017,"As a food lover, I eat at many many restaurants, and Bj's happens to be one of my go-to's. Food is always 9/10 and sometimes better. Best part is that you can always customize your meal with no expense unless you add extra of course. I think their quality of food is outstanding. I mean, you can tell it was made right of the oven or grill. Most of the food is on the ""clean"" side and not so greasy. I love how everything has its own unique flavor, because if you take an extra moment and reflect on some other restaurants dishes, some things taste the same. At Bj's, there's a huge difference from the steaks, to chicken, between the variety of salads, the pastas and most importantly, the pizzas and pizookies. Flavor is on point all the timeeeeee!  I advise you to order something different everytime you come back. Try something new. You won't be disappointed! I love trying new things and going out of my usual orders.  I definitely recommend the pizzas. They are absolutely one of a kind and you just have to try it out yourself if you haven't. They're stuffed with fresh toppings, the dough is thick, there isn't really a crust BUT the edges and outer dough has that perfect crunch you look for in a pizza.  Lastly, you MUST get a pizookie! There are so many flavors and all of them are insanely good. They recently added a chocolate mint one and I have yet to try it. My favorite is the classic chocolate chip, but the macadamia one has huge macadamia pieces that make the entire cookie amazing.  ALSO, check out their website prior to going because they usually have great deals, like BOGO or discounts! Take advantage of free pizookies when its offered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=20

Gross. I made them make it again. It's Kraft. Wow. How do you screw that up? My steak was way over seasoned and mealy and who cuts a baked potato in half. Didn't BJs used to specialize in baked potatoes? What happened to the cool house salad that was a signature item? Then I was double charged for an item. Seriously, fire the manager and get someone in here and fix this place before it's too late. I've eaten here so many times. Something is wrong and it's systematic.

Rachel W.,"Ventura, CA",669,482,1475,3.0,12/18/2015,"This is the second time our office has booked BJ's for Christmas Party, and I have to give props to the wait staff for being able to handle a group of 25 inebriated women (save me, who was still nursing a hangover from the festivities the night before, so loud noises were not my friend) and one male co-worker who gives clowns a bad name with his rude behavior. The wait time for our meals was a bit long, and while I realize a group of that size was challenging, some of the ladies ordered upon entering the restaurant, because they had to leave early, and the meals did not come out until almost an hour later, and one persons meal never came out so they had to reenter the order, and someone had to take it home for her and bring it to her today. As for the rest of us that stayed, there were many positive comments on the meals, one person ordered the Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and corn, she said it was so moist and the coating on the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Another person got the BBQ Pizza, she said she gets it all the time and that everyone should order it. I saw an awesome Club Sandwich that made me wish I'd picked that over my order. Leading to my order: I chose the BBQ Brisket Burger,  which consisted of Patty topped with smoked brisket pieces, Applewood smoked bacon, shredded jack and cheddar cheese,  bbq sauce, red onions and mayonnaise. I asked for no Mayo, BBQ sauce and Mayo just did not sound right in this girls eyes.   Burger Wise, I was truly disappointed in this burger, the meat was dry, the bun was dry, the cheese was not melted, and there was little to no BBQ sauce on the burger.... the positive the wedge fries were good, and so was the Strawberry Margarita I had. The positives of the party:  The cocktails were awesome, the appetizers were good,  the staff were always polite, helpful, and really tried to keep things straight, they always brought us what we needed and tried to correct the mistakes they made. I've always liked BJ's, just because I didn't enjoy one burger, it won't stop me from going back and to be honest if you need to entertain a large party of people, this is the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=20

Kristiana R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/27/2017,"Yesterday my husband and I came here for lunch around 2:30. Upon arrival, the male host was very kind and said he would check on a table for us and sat us within a few minutes. He explained the promotions they had going on and told us to enjoy our meal, and that was the best customer service we had during our stay. Our waitress was a heavyset woman who wore a lot of makeup, looked about 20-something, but had no name tag. She was very unprofessional and not as attentive as I would have liked. As I am a server myself, I know that sometimes serving is not easy when it is busy. However, the restaurant wasn't busy at all yet I felt like she was never around when we needed something. When we asked for something she did not stop at the table she just kept walking by, not leaving any time for us to even ask for everything we needed. She seemed hasty for no reason. A table nearby had been there for a while just talking, and she would constantly ask them if they needed anything else, as if she wanted them to leave already. It just revealed more of her character in that she does not care for the customers, only the money. As we left the restaurant, I regretted tipping her the small amount that I did because I found that she was standing in the front very casually and lazily and talking to the male host. This must have been where she was during the times we needed something! I was very disappointed because I have never had bad service here.  Aside from the mediocre service, the food was fantastic! Which was probably the only reason I tipped at all because I know other employees of the restaurant get tipped. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, bone-in root beer glazed wings for my husband, and a chicken ranch piadina with sweet potato fries for me, and a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert. Everything was delicious, though our server took a long time to bring us condiments such as ranch and ketchup.  I love BJ's and this will not be my last time going because the food is too good and the selection is so wide. However, I do not recommend this server and I do hope management can better train their employees to take better care of their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=40

They have a variety of different cookies, my personal favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla bean ice cream! I am making myself hungry just writing this review! they also used to have an awesome happy hour where it went on as long as the NFL game was on. And it was half off appetizers and I believe five dollar martinis. They changed the prices for the happy hour, it is now $2 off appetizers so it is not the best I wish they would bring it back to half off appetizers.

Javier J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",622,448,499,3.0,6/6/2015,"The last time I came here before this past Saturday..well I was still a teenager and watching the Lakers vs. Celtics in the NBA finals.. Let's fast forward 7 years and we now have me ordering alcoholic drinks and the Lakers with a lottery pick in this years draft..my my how times have changed I called ahead of time for a table, which they allow you to do for parties less than 8..and I asked for a booth for 2..caller beware as this place has 2 person booths..so if you wants a large booth make sure you specify. I had read the reviews, so when I walked in to non smiling faces I wasn't surprised..hostess boy was probably the nicer out of the 3 in the front. Smile a bit and be happy you're not working across the stop sign frying fries all day. (-) After being sat I got my own first smile in there after realizing that they show Dodgers games there..if you're a fan you know how rare that is to find north of LA. So grateful to watch the win that night. Within a minute or two ""Sean L."" (receipt description) presented himself as our waiter. That guy came through and honestly put the people in the front to shame. He was consistent throughout the night and never seemed bothered at my more than handful requests..young guy too which was more impressive as he was giving up his saturday night at work and just did it with smiles. The only time fluke was when he was applying a discount but only because of him needing supervisor approval..when he came back he even apologized for the delay..couldn't have asked for a better table experience service wise. 5/5 Food: Wings:  Chicken wasn't bad and the sauces were okay. Tasted very tyson like but these came through enough while I watched Joc Pederson at bat. 2.7/5 Salad: Spent my side salad doing scoliosis checks because it had nothing but lettuce spines..dry taste..ate it but not delightfully. 1.5/5 Pizza: Good pizza, not too cheesy which is perfect for me..the toppings tasted were an upgrade above the ones had at pizza rev the day before and the fluffiness to it was nice. It could have been cooked just a tiny more to give it a crisp but not bad, not bad at all. 3.5/5 Drinks: Strawberry Splash- This is kind of their signature drink..but it didn't live up to the hype. It was okay but didn't have a nice fruitful taste like you'd expect it to have based off the name. Just something about it 2.5/5 Strawberry Patch- Same story. 2.5/5 Drinks here are okay, they have selection, so I'd recommend just getting what you get at a normal bar and not going after their ""signature"" stuff. My regret. Overall, not a bad chain. I would say I won't be back until the Lakers are in the ship again but with the dodger's on their tv's i'm sure it'll be sooner than a decade from now. Food isn't bad (just fix the salad), drinks can potentially be fine and our waiter proved that good service is possible here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=40

Danielle D.,"Moorpark, CA",1,24,2,1.0,2/24/2017,"I would give 5 stars, however; I ordered a alcoholic beverage and had to send it back twice!! It did not taste right. The bartender put a sweet-n-sour in my drink, that is not suppose to have this ingredient!. After the 2nd time it was apparent she did not know how to make this drink?. So I settled for jack and Coke. Who can go wrong with this?. The down-side of this drink as-well, it taste as if she used a much cheaper brand of whisky!!! I advice to management, hire a bar tender who does not make it apparent to the customer and surrounding customers that she is upset!! Also one that can make a DRINK!!!. People pay high prices for drinks. We expect them to be worth the money.. Bartender was 40-50 years of age, Caucasian, blonde hair with some brown in it and a little on heavy side.. Couldn't see name.. After my complaint the customer service seemed to decline.  The food was ""OK"" the asparagus was horrible to the point it was not edible. This is why I do not like to complain, but the drinks were a disaster.. I TIP AS TO HOW MY SERVICE IS!! GOOD SERVICE I GO BEYOND THE RECOMMENDED. POOR SERVICE, IM SORRY BUT YOUR GOING TO GET WHAT I FEEL YOU TREATED ME AS!.    Since I come for the quality of drinks I will most likely NOT come back to this location..

K C.,"Camarillo, CA",2,17,2,1.0,12/17/2016,"I use to order take out from here somewhat frequently via online, every time I ordered I would ask for no onions and everytime I received onions all over my salad. When I would advise that I noted no onions, someone would give me an attitude saying I never did. The last time I took a photo of the sticker on the box that said ""no onions"" and the salad that had them all over. After having to remove all the onions, I filled out their online review. Never heard from the manager (she actually is one of the people who like to argue with me that I was wrong).   Everytime I pick up takeout, there are 4 or 5 employees standing around talking - no one acknowledges you or says that someone will be right with you. They let you sit there and wait until the take out person comes out. Most of the people who work there act like you crashed a private party and they want you gone. Only twice did I ever receive a smile or friendly interaction.  This last time though took the cake for me, I was rang up by the manager and tipped $2.00 on my take out order - which should have come to $18.15 with the tip. My card though was charged $21.99 someone changed the tip to 36%. When I called for an adjustment, the manager seemed to smirk, and actually laugh a little about why someone would be upset about it. She told me last Tuesday my card would be refunded - it's now Saturday and my bank has no record of a refund being processed back from BJs (so I'll just write corporate since they have such insufficient management). I'm sorry but whoever rang this up incorrectly, I believe did it thinking they wouldn't be caught because the amount was just an odd amount to charge. Hopefully, this isn't a habit they are doing - check your receipts.  In my call, I told the manager of my dissatisfaction with the service in a very assertive manner. She just said ""sorry I'll talk to them"". She should try leading by example, because she's walked past me plenty of times herself and never asked if someone was assisting me, spoken to me rudely when I asked why my meal had onions on it, and I've seen her huddled herself with that same group of employees standing around talking and ignoring the desk. I won't be back to this location, Westlake may be farther and the sometimes I'm not acknowledged right away, but at least 8 times out of ten times if I'm standing at the takeout desk someone asks or goes to get someone to assist me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=60

I tried to point this out but our server rarely came to our table to see how we were doing. He filled my daughters sprite with water. He seemed very overwhelmed and inexperienced. I asked for extra lemon for my ice tea and finale got 2 extra when we asked for lemon for the salmon we ordered. It took 17 minutes to get the mini chocolate chunk.

Felipe L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",1,9,3,2.0,4/25/2017,"I was craving  a red ale and avocado egg rolls, but I ended up very disappointed. Server service was terrible I asked for water four times and they never did give me water, they would always say yes but never came through. Appetizers are supposed to be before the main course, they made us wait a long time then slammed us with appetizers and main course together. Avocado eggrolls were brown and stringy. They claimed they make them fresh daily,  which they probly due but the avocados were definitely old. I have had them before at other locations and they have always been impressive, but not in Oxnard. Then on one of my chicken wing orders they actually gave me a chicken  bone with no meat and they didn't even hide it was on the top of all the wings, it was obvious. For an instant I thought it was a joke I wanted to run in the kitchen and play a joke on the cook. After  complaining to a manager she did apologize and deducted the appetizers, but then they forgot about us. Before paying bespoke to her about the issues again and she apologized again saying yes they dropped the ball and I told her how could it is not even busy and we were not they only customers complaining. This place has hope but before they get better they need to retrain the entire staff, cooks, severs, bulbous, hostess and even the manager because they all sucked, sorry but true. I don't think I will ever return to this BJ's in Oxnard.  This might be our fault as the consumer for not complaining and putting up with the so call service.

Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1403,10421,3.0,8/17/2015,"After having such a tasty lunch at BJ's in Thousand Oaks I decided to have dinner here at BJ's in Oxnard with my husband last night, but based on our experience I am not sure we'll be back.   We were seated promptly at a table.  The restaurant was pretty busy and no booths looked available so I didn't even bother asking.  We were seated next to a large party of 7 adults and 3 kids.  Why do I always get stuck next to little kids?  Anyway, our server introduced himself right away and took our drink order.  Our sodas came to the table quickly and we then ordered appetizers, but after that was done, no one came to check on us for what felt like an eternity.  We were ready to order our main dishes but I got the impression our server was going to wait until the appetizers arrived, which was probably not correct since he isn't even the one that brought out the appetizers anyway... The calamari and brussel sprouts we ordered came to the table maybe 15 min after we ordered them.  During that time the large party of 10 was looking around for someone to help them.  They had drinks but no one had taken their main order yet.  They flagged someone down and I watched as the employee immediately notified our server, who was busy at the kiosk putting an order in or something.  I then watched our server check on another table, deliver a drink and wander into the back kitchen area.   Maybe five minutes after the large table had asked for help our server appeared and took their orders.  My husband's drink and mine were empty at this point and our server eventually came back to our table, refilling my diet coke with ice tea and delivering a fresh soda water to my husband with ice in the glass (as opposed to his first glass and request of no ice).  I got my drink corrected and our order was finally taken.  I wanted a custom cookie dessert and our server said he'd see if they could make it.  Later he came back to inform me that they could not make it the way I had requested.  Instead of offering me the menu to make another selection, he just left the table.  I had to wait for him to come back to order again. Food was okay but I didn't realize the batter they use on their calamari had some heat to it, maybe a 1.5 on a scale of 0 to 10.  Just enough to make me regret ordering it.  Also though some of the squid rings were tender, I'd say about half were too chewy and the tentacles were very chewy and overcooked.    My side salad was okay, though the staff treated it as if it was my entrée and didn't bring it out when they brought my husband's side-salad out.  I had ordered the side salad and then a dessert, hoping that would be my entrée but since my dessert request got declined and I wasn't offered an alternative I sat around wondering what I was even going to eat. In the end I got a different dessert and that was the highlight of my visit.  The dessert was fantastic, the salad was all right and the appetizer I got wasn't what I wanted.  My husband ate his brussel sprouts but didn't have much good to say about them.  "".... maybe... if they had more sauce?""  He enjoyed his flat iron steak and steamed vegetables. Women's restroom was clean and well-stocked.  Temperature in the restaurant was kept low and the lights were not bright. It was loud inside (even before one of the kids at the table next to us started wailing and screeching) and would be good if you wanted to watch one of the games on TV but not for a casual/comfortable date spot. Service: 2 stars - meh, I've had better Food: 3 stars, mostly for the dessert One last note - hubby and I noticed the water conservation sign on the host stand when we entered so we were surprised when our server came to our table with glasses of water we didn't want and set them down for us.  We told him we didn't want them and he took them away and put them back on the bar counter.  Maybe he didn't get the memo?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=80

Then we waited 40 minutes for our food when my sister finally asked for the manager. She came and said she'd see where our food is. And that was the last we saw of her. The waitress came 4 min later with our food she literally put the plates down and walked away really fast. Was hoping to see the manager again which we didnt. Was hoping to get a free dessert or something for the crappy service and the fact we were there for 2 hours just waiting most of the time. Not going here again.

Michael F.,"Ventura, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Somehow they missed my already low expectations for a chain restaurant. My visit was on a Sunday evening, mostly older people and families were there at this time. We were sat next to a table of overly loud people(pretty much at shouting volume). They had been drinking and were borderline drunk. Every other word they spoke was offensive, sexual in nature or profanity. This normally does not bother me but this was daytime hours when families were around. Tables surrounding them were visibly upset by this scene. The worst part of this was the mother at the table chugging her drink and describing sexually explicit acts while holding her infant.  When I was about to complain to a manager I watched him walk over to the table and sit with them and join in on the ""fun"". It was then I realized that two of the patrons were employees and were celebrating a birthday. In my opinion having management sit with such a group and participate in their behavior is not acceptable and shows no sense of professionalism. I will not be coming back, instead I will just take my family to my local dive bar where people have respect for others around them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=100

So my new favorite addition is on the appetizer menu: Dry Rub Chicken Wings in Lemon Pepper; man these babies are deeelicious! Talk about the right way to cook a chicken wing, it's all about the crunch secondary to the flavor and these wings have it all! 10 wings for $10.50 may be a bit pricey, but if you come in during HH, it's $2 off! Plus the mini pizzas are pretty much half off-you chose from the many flavors from their regular sized pizza-great selection on flavors!  I highly recommend coming in during Happy Hour, & sit at the bar otherwise service at the regular dinning tables will be slow to non-existent.  Enjoy!

The check is literally the last thing you have to do before you're done with the party you're serving. 10+ minutes to wait on your bill and a box is ridiculous. Especially when you see your waiter socializing at the bar instead of bringing you something so simple. I work with food myself !

Wildflower M.,"Washington, DC",0,15,4,4.0,5/12/2015,"**VEGETARIAN** I recently visited BJ's while on travel to Ontario, CA for business. Had never heard of it, but I always have good experiences with food at brew housesI ordered the Santa Fe Salad withOUT the chicken. Instead I asked for a veggie patty on the side. It was great! I diced it and placed it over the salad. Great option for vegetarians! I've ordered it a few times since.  Also, you can sub most items that contain meat with black beans.  The environment is bright, casual, in and out quickly and sports on flat screens so no  matter where you sit you can watch something while dining. I have not yet dined outside but will next time. Unfortunately, the view is nothing more than a highway type street. Wish there was more of a scene around this town, but so far...haven't found it. Will keep looking.

I've been to many BJs and this is my first bad experience. I ordered pizza to go with only 2 toppings on it. When I got to my hotel room, there were at least 3 pieces that didn't have any toppings on them. They have a special ""to go"" section that you order from, so the people that are helping us there should know that it's to go...no napkins, no utensils. Come on Shasta D, if someone tips you for a to go order, you should make sure they have everything they need before bringing the bag to them. The young man at the front counter helped me with that so thank you. The pizza was soggy and flavorless. I have had some great food and beer before so I was expecting something good! I feel that the staff should be better trained on making customers feel special and give them class A service! I probably won't come back to the Oxnard BJs for a while but I will visit others.

I came in for dinner two nights ago with my niece and sister and although we had an ok dining experience, I just wanted to point out one thing we noticed. We were there for a little over an hour, seated in the back area close to the bathroom entrance and we noticed one of the hostesses repeatedly circulating around that area on her cell phone. I understand that sometimes we all have a tendency to check our phones while at work, but this girl was legitimately texting for minutes at a time. She would stand in one corner  and just kind of walk in place oblivious to her surrounding.

Denise G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/19/2016,"BJs is one of my all time favorite restaurants to order from. 99.9% of the time, my husband and I order take out. No complaints there. Our order is always accurate, on time as promised through their app and delicious!  Since today is Father's Day, my husband and I decided to go dine in and actually have lunch . There was a gentleman up front that told us there was a 20 min wait. No problem. We'll wait. But what bothered me is when I stared seeing other walk ins (not reservations because I was near the desk to hear) that were also party's of 2 being seated before us. 2 other party's to be exact! They had plenty of seating so not sure what was this issue there.  When we were finally seated, we asked if we can have a booth since we had our 7 month old with us. The gentleman said no because they ""didn't have enough servers"" so we settled into one of their smaller 2 person booths. Keep in mind we had our son, which we had asked for a high chair before even being seated and was not given, his diaper bag, toys and snacks to keep him entertained. We could NOT fit in this small space. 10 min later when our waiter finally did arrive we asked to be moved to a booth where we had previously seen was an area she was handling. With an attitude she exhales deeply like it was a bother to her and says ""I can do it this time because there's not that many people."" Ok..   We finally get seated, she gives us our menus and says she will be back. We already knew what we wanted, we get the same meals whether it's take out or the rare times we dine in.. We told her as soon as we sat that we were ready to order. She let us know she would be back. I kid you not 15 min passed and she did not return. I became irritated and told my husband it was time to leave. The gentleman that had previously seated us, looked at us and gave us what I believe was a rude look. Didn't ask if there was a problem or anything.  Can't say they were busy either.

I was so happy here that I went 3 days straight, and the service and food was consistent each time. I love the unlimited salad deal, with the tomato soup. It is very difficult to find a good tomato soup, and this one is hearthy, yet creamy and flavors are right when they should be. My husband had a fried southern chicken with mashed potatoes that I tried a bite, highly recomended. I felt we travelled to Luisiana with those flavors... But let's talk about the Manager again. If I were to run a multimillion dollar corporation, I will blindly hire him. What an effective, hands on Manager! Yet when my husband complimented him, he was so humble to acknowledge it is him but rather the BJ's organization that he works for! He keeps his Team highly motivated and it did not matter at what time you went to the restaurant, he was always in the floor helping, observing and leading by example!!! Mathew, Kudos to you!

Once seated, we did not have any silverware on our table. Our server was friendly and did a good job of serving our lunch of the Santa Fe salad (lots of not so green lettuce) and the BBQ chicken salad, which had a very small splash of BBQ sauce that was to mean it was a BBQ salad. The salad was very bland due to the lettuce being almost all pale green and no GREEN lettuce in the salad. The chicken was moist and not dried out which was the saving grace.

This place was like thee place to have dinner/lunch with friends back when we were in H.S./early college years and I got tired of going.  Years later, I recently went back [Last night] for a get together with some old friends and service sucked!  Okay, so we had reservations at 10 P.M. and got seated fast, the waitress took our drink order and freaking took forever to give us our drinks, even just water.  Everyone at the table was getting impatient, because it was late and we were hungry and we haven't ordered our food.  When we did order our food, it took even longer for us to get our damn orders...someone in our table got their order 10 minutes after we all got ours.  The service last night was just so HORRIBLE, they weren't even busy like how the place usually would be - empty tables everywhere! *Food:  Last night my bf and I shared the Thai Salmon: Wow, I LOVE salmon, but damn, they did not cook it right, it was too dry = OVERCOOKED the Thai salmon consists of Spicy Thai sauce, white rice, snow peas, carrots, red bell peppers and onions topped with fresh mango salsa, everything about it just didn't taste as great as I thought it would have... = DISAPPOINTED Pizza: I remember trying their pizza once and I hated it, it's too doughy for my kind of pizza. Sandwiches: I've tried a few of their sandwiches and they weren't bad at all, maybe I'll stick to sandwiches that's if when I do go back... Calamari: YUMMY! I love CALAMARI, and there's were good , the down fall was I paid $9.25 and the portion was mother freakingly SMALL! I'd rather go get calamari at Kabuki, at least their portion is decent for the price whether it's happy hour or not. Alcoholic Beverages:  Their prices in drinks are not bad at all.  A shot of Patron was $8-9; it's usually $10-12 in other places.  My best friend and I also got the White Gummy Bear shot and it was only $6.50 and the bartender gave us more than a shot, it was like 2 shots put into a big shot glass = Awesome!   Why 2 Stars? well, prices in alcohol is one star, taste of calamari [some places aren't great] is another star, service is minus one star, but pazooki adds back up the 2nd star....

We forgot to asked for condiment so we ask other waitress and she gave us an attitude which was very rude and unprofessional. My fiancé sandwich was good but one of the condiment was really cold. My calm chowder soup was not good it tasted like it was straight from the can and just microwave it and just placed it in the bread bowl.  And my fiancé and I had to wait for the check for good 30-40 min. We got at that the restaurant 4:30pm and still here which is almost 7pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=180
Tyler A.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",7,1,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Jus went to the BJs Green Flash brew dinner. Have to say not impressed at all. We called ahead and asked about the dd ticket. They said if your dd doesn't eat any of the food or drink you would not have to paid for the ticket. So we made reservations for 4 drink tickets. When we got the bill we were charged for 4 drink tickets plus a dd ticket even tho the dd didn't eat anything. They charged us full price for everything, even tho we paid in advanced. They didn't even ask us if we paid in advance. The production of this dinner was very poor. Very disappointed in everything. If they knew the system didn't differentiate between a reservation for that day or a reservation before that date they should ask about it. The pours where okay depending on who you got as the server. And the pizza was a slice of pizza for the main course. It is not a really 4 course meal. It is more of a sample of a 4 course meal. The whole experience left more to be desired a lot more to be desired. I would defiantly not go back to a BJs pair dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=180

But they brought the wrong french fires (shoestring) to the table then insisted that they'd bring me the steak fries. Wish I had declined. The steak fries are dipped in a seasoned battered and were terrible. They really need to try perfecting some crisp thick fries and maybe offer a few flavored sea salts to give them an extra something.  The calamari was good as was the aioli sauce.

Ruby L.,"Oxnard, CA",7,10,2,1.0,7/22/2015,"I'm not coming here again. Sorry but not sorry.  A year ago I went with my friend to eat for dinner and didn't see our server the whole time. We saw her attending to big parties but not us and we had to ask her and other people to refill our drinks and even to bring us desserts. I understand that you can be busy but not even pay attention to a table that has a potential to tip you well? I almost didn't want to tip but I'm not that cruel.  So I decided to try this place again with my boyfriend for lunch. We didn't care about a booth or table and these old ladies wanted a booth and was told that they would have to wait a couple of minutes. We got sat quickly. Then a moment later they got sat.  My boyfriend and I were looking through the menu when I noticed a server went up to them to get their drink order. I was thinking, okay maybe our server is busy and can't get to us yet? So I waited paitenly as maybe about five different people walked by us.  Then I noticed that the old ladies had gotten wine and bread and their menus were gone. Still no server.  Saw a server attend to a table behind us and glanced our way when he walked by. That was the last straw. I'm a server and I understand people can get busy and takes a while to get to a table but no one greeted us or even told us that they would be right with us. We waited about 20 minutes die someone to at least come by.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to leave and as we walked out he told the hosts that no one went to our table and that we were leaving. They only said sorry and didn't try to fix the situation. I was infuriated as we left.  Not going back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=180

First  I had to ask for a hot potato as mine was half cooked and cold. Not a good start. I had asked for the steak medium rare and it at best was medium. It was very dry and definitely NOT a rib eye. At best it was a top sirloin and very tasteless.  Had it not been that our waitress was as charming as always  I would have complained very loudly. I was taking some very important people out and was so disappointed that I may never go back despite the fact that I had had several good experiences before.

The dough is fluffy and the pizza does not come out completely soaking is grease, which is nice. I did have mozzarella sticks on the other occasion, which were pleasant as well.  The restaurant is clean and nice décor. Usually we end up seating ourselves in the bar area, so there's not much of a wait. Our waiters\waitresses have usually been prompt and attentive. However, I do not think the prices for alcoholic beverages are on the drink menu? Or maybe I just missed it, I ordered a strawberry fruity alcoholic drink, It is good but when we got the bill it was like 9.00! (it is not THAT good). I don't remember it being so expensive the last time, however it might have been a happy hour then? That was my one complaint, that's expensive for a fruity drink that I never end of finishing the last 1\4 of it because it gets watery as it sits. Usually come here with family a lot, seeing as I believe they get BJ points? Not sure but we had a free Pazooki ticket, which was absolutely delicious! Never had one before coming here.

If you hate your job, please quit but don't make food with out putting in a small bit of effort to make it correctly.

Ryan K.,"Moorpark, CA",1,4,1,1.0,3/1/2015,"So my date and i felt like having one of these pizza cookies. It was either Bj's or Toppers Pizza. Sadly, we chose Bj's.  We felt bad just ordering the pizza cookie so we got a mini pizza as well. I was in the restroom and the waiter, name short for bob, was talking to my date. He assumed that she was alone, and when he found out there was another person, he seemed off. She ordered the mini pizza, and he was like, ""just a mini pizza?"" A tad rude. The mini pizza took a while too. By the time he got us water when I got back and took my seat, he was not talkative and very distant. He seemed perfect with other customers. It made my date and I felt very very very uncomfortable. It really felt awkward everytime he would walk by us and not make a smile or even eye contact.  The mini pizza arrived 30 minutes later, and still we have not received napkins or any utensils. It was 4 slices, and it was not the very best because my date only ate 1 and i had 2.  I feel like the waiter either wanted to us to order more food or just leave. Like I mentioned earlier, our whole date was very uncomfortable because of the waiter. The way he acted towards others and not us it was just weird.  Well we finally got to order the pizza cookies and right when he delivered it he left the check right next to it.

Meli. O.,"Oxnard, CA",4,47,18,2.0,5/12/2016,"I've experienced better while dining in! Last night was the first time I opted to try the curbside pickup and not to self, never will I make that mistake again. I ordered via their website what I thought was primarily a simple process however I guess the employees cant read and interpret what the screen displays. No wonder why most restaurants are opting for computers without human interference. I ordered CALIFORNIA CHICKEN CLUB, NO TOMATO add MUSTARD, Thin fries with cheese and a dessert and submitted my order to be picked up at 6:30 pm. I caught my own error bc I placed the make and model of a GTI 2 door as the pickup vehicle. When I arrived  they were no pickup curbside spots available so I parked 2 spots over and called them and spoke to whoever answered the phone and told them that I was in a Nissan Sentra instead of GTI and that I was parked 2 spots down. That fell on deaf ears since I see Glenda walking out to the curbside with bags and going back inside the restaurant. I knew that was my order. I gave it 10 mins and I called again and Glenda picked up. I told her the same story that I did to some other rep a few mins ago and she apologized and came outside. As soon as she gave me order, I asked her does my fries have cheese...she looked confused and she said I can get cheese added to them. 10 minutes later she comes back with fresh fries but at this point my sandwich was soggy bc of the steam and being in a closed container 35 mins later. When I got home with my soggy sandwich I opened it up and bingo no mustard and soggy, old lettuce. I laughed it off at this point and realized the sticker on the box said ""add mustard"" ""cheese to fries""!!!! Why, is it so hard to follow directions. I blame myself also since I was too lazy to call the manager, too lazy to get dressed and dine in. There you have my  list a few grievances, spending close to $43 on 3 meals to have soggy sandwich and warm fries, I would expect that at a McDonalds certainly not this place.

Merbita J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,17,1.0,11/11/2013,"We have been patrons of BJ's for years and have enjoyed delicious food and exceptional service.  However, based upon our experience this past Saturday, we will no longer be dining at any of their restaurants.  With every point of contact, from the hostess to several of the wait staff, we were treated with much indifference.  Upon our arrival (which was around 4pm to beat the dinner rush), the hostess for the evening greeted us with a forced smile and then had us waiting while she took a phone call for several minutes.  I have worked in the food and service industry in the past, and one very important thing I learned was to always first serve those who are right in front of you.  A phone call can wait.   When we were finally seated, our low-energy waitress provided us with lackluster service.  I believe she had 3 small tables total, but was hardly attentive.  We found it odd because she kept disappearing to the kitchen, but would return with nothing.   And speaking of the kitchen, the food was truly disappointing.  We were actually there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  My husband and I were so looking forward to indulging in some of their beautifully crafted beers, mouth-watering pizzas, and, of course, end our special night with a scrumptious pizookie!  However, we should have known something was terribly wrong when we each received a dinner salad that was almost a third full of wilted, glassy-looking lettuce.   We let the salad slide because perhaps it was just a fluke.  But then, we received our hand tossed, thin crust pizza and we were so disheartened from the appearance alone.  The pizza was sloppily put together with strands of partially melted cheese on top strewn across the top.  Indeed, we found our pizza to be lukewarm at best and the taste was substandard.  What happened to the BJ's quality we had come to know and love?! Suffice it to say, our anniversary dinner was not what we were hoping it would be.  It was memorable, but unfortunately, not in a good way.  We could have eaten anywhere we wanted, but chose BJ's based on our past experiences, the amazing food, and quick, friendly service.  The management needs to be held accountable for the poor quality of food & the apathetic employees.  So disappointed at what this restaurant has become.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=220

Alex A.,"Oxnard, CA",4,28,26,2.0,9/14/2015,"Haven't been here for a while. Usually the service and food are great. Decided to eat here last night and boy what a mistake that was.  First we tell them that we need a table for 6, preferably a booth. They sat us at a table for 4 then they're scrambling to find two other chairs once I told her we are 6 not 4. I asked what about a booth and she said there is nothing else available. I told her what about the booth right behind us. She said it's not available, but nobody was sitting there, ok. Then it took about 15-20min before the waiter even came to our table and when he did he didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink, he dropped of the silverware and napkins and left. I was sarcastic when he came by and dropped off the silverware, he said you guys are going to need these as I replied yes and some DRINKS too and all he did was laugh. That didn't even seem to work!!! We sat for over 30min before we got anything to drink. Any other time I would of just left. I don't know why I didn't do it this time. The service was just HORRIBLE! We ordered the appetizer when we ordered our drinks and we didn't get it till about 5min before our meal came.  Throughout this entire time I asked one of them idiots in all black if we where going to get some kind of service soon, we've been sitting here for 30min and nothing to drink. She said yes I'm really sorry and someone will come to help you. Right there and then she should of went out of her way and asked what we wanted to drink. Not to mention our pizzas where cold. Our food was probably done but our waiter never checked, cause it wasn't until I asked if our food was coming soon and our waiter gasped and said oh yes let me check. So basically we sat for about 1hr 15min before we even started to eat. Manager never bothered to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything as he walked right next to us asking the other tables. I've heard from others that the service has gone downhill lately, it is very true. So many other great places to eat in Ventura county that as a customer you don't really need to put up with crap like this. Usually any other professional establishment try and make up for the bad service but not here. I don't think they even realized they F'd up.

Princess Kim R.,"San Diego, CA",121,250,,2.0,9/24/2012,"My boyfriend and I ventured into Oxnard late one night after spending entirely too much time being lazy in Ventura. What were we doing? Honestly, I don't remember. It probably involved some combination of watching wack comedy, doing our best sloth impressions on his couch, and me avoiding his cat like it was carrying the Black Plague. At any rate, we needed late-night food, and this was one of the few places that was open. We got there maybe a half hour before closing time, which I feel is all right. We wouldn't walk in 10 minutes before midnight or anything. We're not dicks, even if one of us has some pretty great man bits (Hint: It's not me.). We ordered our food, and since I knew the kitchen was closing and wanted a dessert that usually takes some advance notice, I asked if I should put in the order for it right then, with the food. The server was a doll and told me that I still had time, and that I could wait. Cool. It's nice to be able to eat and not feel rushed. The food arrived, and it was pretty forgettable. I know, I know. It's chain restaurant food. It's not supposed to be memorable. Anyway, I don't remember gagging, and I certainly didn't feel the need to give up on life while eating there (I'm looking at you, Crapplebee's). The food by itself would probably get 3 stars. Here's where things took a turn for the worse. After we'd gotten our bill, I was pulling money out of my bag to pay, and some scrotum-head security guard on a power trip walked over, swinging his flashlight and clearly mistaking himself for a big, swinging dick in the world of chain restaurant security. ""Hey, you guys need to wrap it up, eh? We're trying to get home."" Dude, who the fuck are you? Our server is the one busting her ass, and she's being WAY more patient and polite than you are. Also, what do you think I'm planning on doing with this cash? Making it rain? Trust me, the only selling point to Oxnard is that the boxer Sergio Martinez lives here, and since I haven't seen him around this joint, I'm making like a tree and leaving.  After we'd paid and were approaching the door, we came across the same security guard, only this time, he was accompanied by a member of the restaurant staff. He wished us a good night in front of the staff member as if he hadn't just tried to shake us from the place like the last drops of pee at a urinal. My boyfriend, being more outspoken than I am, gave him a sarcastic, ""Yeah, ok."" I gave him a jerk-off motion. Behind his back. In my head.

He took her lunch back twice and unfortunately we didn't feel comfortable about it cause it still didn't look like it was cooked enough.  So he was worried that she didn't have anything to eat while she waiting, so he left the fries.  After the second time of refusing the sandwich, he allowed her to order a different sandwich at no charge.

Debbie M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Food was OK, the service HORRIFIC.  Sunday evening July 26 about 5:30 pm.  Lots of open tables, not crowded at all.  A meal for party of four (just sandwiches, nothing fancy) took over an hour and 40 minutes.  We were seated immediately, no wait.  Our server finally took our order over 30 minutes later, then it took another 35 minutes for the food to show up at the table.  We're seated at the table for over an hour before the food arrives. Server couldn't care less.  Had to wait for 15-20 minute gaps for her to return to the table, and each time I have to ask for drink refills; she disappears and comes back 15-minutes later with the iced tea refill pitcher.  My ice has long since melted in my glass, and she just pours warm tea from a pitcher into the glass with no ice.  Had to ask her for ice, and she disappears for another 15-20 minutes.  Made the mistake of ordering a pizookie for dessert; that took another half hour. Just like the previous reviewer said ""Service sucked, service sucked, service sucked"".  The management at this restaurant should be looking through these yelp reviews, notice that a significant number of them identify the terrible service, and fix the problem.  Like many others, I won't come back here; doesn't matter how good the food is, when the service is this bad, it turns customers away for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=260

We took awhile to figure out what we wanted, but our server was patient and checked in a couple of times before we ordered. My husband ordered the top sirloin with potatoes & green beans, his meal was delicious! I was a little jealous & wished I had ordered what he did. I ordered the jalapeno burger with the tomato/mozzarella salad & fries. Everything tasted good, but the tomato salad was my favorite. I also ordered the Jerry Burst beer, which I enjoyed. My children ordered kids meals: pizza & mac n cheese. It was as expected & the kids enjoyed it. We finished our meals by sharing pizookies. They were perfect & gobbled up in no time!

I am Asian but married to a Caucasian. Whenever I am with my family, without my husband, we are treated very poorly. The service gets significantly better only when my husband is with us.  The food is great, no doubt about that. But it isn't worth going because there is always a long wait. Food served is always wrong. I can go on and on about my complaints but I am sure a lot of people have already experienced the same.  My favorite on their menu is the spaghetti with spicy sauce and meatballs. The last time I was there, I had to return it twice because they kept giving me the wrong sauce (it was a red marinara sauce with meat and not spicy at all, not the orange-ish colored, spicy one I always had) When I complained, they told me that was the only sauce they had, when I argued even more, they said they no longer served it the way they did before? WTF? Also, the breadsticks that came with the spaghetti were so burnt they did not even look edible.  Another time I was there with my two kids, we were seated after a long wait. We had our menu closed and waited for a host to greet us and get our order but nobody came. There were waiters passing our table left and right, but nobody stopped at our table. After half an hour sans service, we walked out.  Shitty, shitty restaurant, the worst ever in my books. We are never going back there again. I will be happy if they go out of business and replaced with a restaurant who value their customers.

Minimal toppings, would have sent it back if there had been someone to send it with. After a very long wait the birthday pazookie arrived, we wanted to order more for everyone, but, again, there was no one from whom to order...

Victor V.,"Camarillo, CA",6,103,1,2.0,5/26/2013,"Used to be good, but now tastes like everything else cooked in Oxnard does.   I ate here fairly regularly when they opened. Decent steaks and burgers, OK personal pizzas too.      Tried one of the B.J. bacon cheeseburgers for lunch and told the server ""pink and juicy on the inside"" when she asked how I wanted it cooked.   Guess how it came out?   Well-done.    I had declined both the wedge fries and the crispy fries and opted for a side of onion rings.  When the dish was brought out, I got bits of onion covered with batter. They appeared to be left-overs (and just warm).  The server says they have ""onion strings"" not rings.  Why did she not tell me that when I ordered rings?      I cut the burger up and showed her the well-done meat.  She said she'd get me one cooked per the order.  A shift manager came by and said another burger is on its way....       My gal finished her sandwich which was OK, before my second burger arrived. The second burger comes out 3/4 medium well, 1/4 medium( pink) and fairly dry.  The server checks and asks ""how did they do?""  and I say the same as the last one.  Another manager shows up and says ""that's not how a medium burger should look!""    He offered to cook me one himself, but I thanked him and said strike two - we are good to go.  He says no charge for my burger.   I had good service, but below par food.  This seems to counter most of the other reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=280

Natals P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,14,242,4.0,2/10/2013,"I'm new to the west coast and was pleasantly surprised by this chain brewery/restaurant. I've been about four times now and cannot say I've been knocked out by their beers, but they offer other breweries on draft and in bottles at reasonable prices. There is a decent amount of vegetarian options as far as bar fare is concerned. The pizzas are pretty tasty with loads of options for toppings, though watch out-the price for toppings can add up quickly. I'd recommend going during happy hour when the beers are cheaper and the mini pizzas are half price. Now THAT is a good deal! Apparently it can get really crowded here, but only once did I have to wait and it was only 10 minutes at the most. I think the service could be stepped up just a notch as far as attentiveness is concerned. They have a rewards program,  but I had to ask about it, and I've never been asked about it when I pay resulting in me forgetting and having to go online to get credit for the visit. I have yet to see the benefits of the rewards program but my coworker said it was worth it. I guess whatever reward comes will be worth it since its free. They seem to be very accommodating to groups, which was my first visit, but that was also the worst service I experienced - relatively speaking. To the servers credit, she was extremely friendly and did what she could to remedy the issues immediately.  Overall, a relaxed atmosphere that is a nice place to go for a beer or two with friends.

For the next 15 minutes the entire wait staff fussed over a party of about 12 people, moving them, chatting with them, bringing drinks, etc. I ordered the special Ginger IPA and was excited to try it. My friend, upon advice from our waitress, decided to test mine before ordering a full glass, as it's a hoppy beer, and not for the uninitiated or faint of heart. We ordered the avocado rolls because we were so hungry.... and thought they would go well with the beer. quite a while later we were informed (very casually) that there was no more Ginger. Big disappointment. 5pm on Saturday of Father's Day weekend, and no Ginger IPA to be had. Waitress didn't make any other suggestions, so I just ordered plain tea, which arrived along with my friend's water. We asked twice about our avocado rolls, and were told they were being assembled. No suggestions or inquiries about food. Ice tea quickly disappeared, as the glass was mostly filled with ice. No more tea, no more waitress. Another person brought the avocado rolls, but neither noticed, nor offered more water or tea. The rolls were a bit spicy for my senior friend, and the sauce completely off the chart, so we flagged down our waitress and asked for sweet and sour or some other ""suitable"" substitute. Another long wait.... and we snagged her attention, and she informed us that the manager had advised her that there simply was nothing that could be done. At this point my friend ordered our check. Still no more tea, no water, and leftover avo-rolls. No inquiries, no offers, no apologies, which is not what I have come to enjoy or expect from BJs. I had been going to Yard House and Lazy Dog to try them out, and sadly have come to the realization that BJs is suffering from the competition and is either not training people to ""compete"" or just not carefully monitoring what was not at all a busy store at 5 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=280

However, their bar area is filled with typical suburbanites who refuse to go to any of the other bars in Oxnard. We were fortunate to find a table by the bar within 20 minutes of being there. It took us 30 minutes to receive our first drink and then another 20 minutes to get our food. The blonde beer I ordered was delicious. The pizza on the other hand had burnt crust and cheese which made it taste like one of those dry pizzas you get from gas stations. I should've asked if they had super unleaded gas and air fresheners.  The best time to go BJs is during the week around 3-7 when the place is less than full and you can actually enjoy the food, beer and service.

Get the Rib-Eye.  They make it quite good.  I order it with the mushroom and blue cheese topping which accents the steak's good flavor. While their house specialty is pizza, I was not particulalrly enamoured with it.  A bit too thick-crusted for my tastes. Of course they have numerous choices for beer.  I go for the Lightswitch, a pale light beer that does not overpower the meal.

The second we got to the register she straight up walked away without saying anything. We walked another five minutes for someone else to come help us. When we got home my salad was hardly a salad. About three leaves of lettuce, two pear slices, and a few crumbles of bleu cheese. It tasted horrible. Seriously, how do you mess up salad? Eggrolls and pizza were both noticeably burnt.

Ok, I get that we didn't put our name on the list, and that it looks like all of Oxnard came to BJ's for grad dinner. The bar was packed, dining room packed, waiting area packed. Such a huge restaurant, how could it take that long to funnel people through?? 2. Not enough places to sit while waiting for a table. It's bad enough to have a 35 minute wait. Then you don't give them enough room to sit?  3. Our waitress was SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW.  Now I understand why there was such a long wait. We were at that restaurant for 2 hours. Most of it was spent waiting on her to take our order, or bring us our check.  4. Our server took twice as long to bring us our beers since she could barely lift the pitchers. She walked like she was going to fall over at any moment.  5. Waitress hand-off. Who wants to switch waitresses half-way through? The first one was slow, the second wasn't much better because she appeared to have other tables under her watch. Once again, we got ignored.  The saving grace was our food.

I was in Ventura this weekend and was hankering for some Asian food since it's difficult to find in SB. I found 2 places that had solid 4 star ratings on yelp, but when I got to the places, they looked like dingy food court establishments (not naming any names...). Now, while that's fine for a quick meal during the work day, I wanted something more for dinner. After driving back and forth several times, we ended up at BJ's Pizza. We haven't been here in 2+ years, since the last 2 we were in Boston and they aren't in SB (big surprise). We ordered a medium pizza, half BJ's Favorite and half Mediterranean with an Italian Market salad. The bf got their brew of the day and I got their black cherry soda. We finished our meal (as gluttonous as it was), with the Oreo cookie pizookie. (The bf chose it b/c it's the ""only one that had 3 scoops of ice cream"", which is funny since he's not a big dessert person.) The food is always consistent here and I'm a fan of the deep dish, so I enjoyed it. I've never had the soda before and thought it was good, and the bf enjoyed his microbrew.

I understand that on Friday evenings things can get pretty hectic and I'm trying to be forgiving of that but my experience with this chain was very disappointing. I called about an hour in advance in order to make a reservation for 10 people and was told by the hostess that in order for any reservations to be made it must be done 30 minutes in advance. So I called 30 minutes later and was told that they could not book reservations for that time since my party was 10 or more. I informed that when I called earlier I was told I had to call 30 minutes before arriving. After expressing my disappointment with being told two different things I was offered to be put on the waitlist for that time slot but that they couldn't guarantee that I would have seats but they would keep me on the list until that time. So to add icing on the cake when I arrived I found out I wasn't even put on the list at all and had to wait just like everyone else to be seated.

I've visited this place a few times for food and drinks. Their food is ok. Its honestly nothing special. Their pizza is good but not great. I can easily point to Toppers or Dominck's as having much better pizza. Their pasta is mediocre. Their avocado rolls I do like.  One of the strong points of this place is its' large selection of beers (naturally since it is a brewhouse). The problem is that it is not the best place to have drinks with friends, even in the bar area. They have good selection but the setup of the locale doesn't invite for an atmosphere of relaxed socialization. It is mainly a restaurant after all.  In conclusion this place is ok, but I don't think the large number of people justify the quality of this place, probably just a thing of habit to come to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=340

When it was figured out that the potato was mine I offered to take it anyway but the waitress insisted she give me the right potato and came a few minutes later with a baconless potato. Super awesome in my opinion. The pizookie is to die for. At first I was trying to eat all the ice cream before it melted but after failing I realized the melted ice cream was drenching the cookie underneath and it turned into this amazing warm chocolaty sludge that was out of this world.

Of course I was going to return it once someone had called. As I was in the restaurant of course the phone is ringing so I answered it and it turned out to be one of the employees. She was so happy to see she got her phone back and was so kind to buy me and my friends dessert for returning her phone. Besides that all of the people that were there working that night were kind from the beginning. It's a great atmosphere fun to eat at and a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=380
Renee S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/27/2015,"We went to BJs in Oxnard on a Saturday evening. We waited about ten minutes to be seated, which I was very surprised. Normally, their waiting times are very long in the evenings.. Gina was our waitress, she was very prompt with introducing herself and asking us what we want to drink, from there the service took a turn for the worse!! We ordered our food about 10mins later, then we waited about 20mins and she comes by asking if they brought us out our ticket? I advised her honey we haven't even received our dinner.. She replies with, she was confused and she will go speak to the kitchen manager, as she walks away, my boyfriend and I are looking like what's wrong w her, we see a bussed bringing our food out  she passed her up going to the kitchen. I believe Gina was physically at work but mentally somewhere else! She returned, apologizes, ask if we need anything, I asked for Parmesan Cheese for my daughters spaghetti, we never received it. I cut her noodles for her and my daughter ate all of her dinner, she was hungry after our long wait for our food and she had been asking for spaghetti since the night before. I needed a1 sauce food my steak, I could never get her attention as she was very busy w attending to all the other newly seated customers getting them started, she forgot about tending to her other tables. So I got any bussed attention I could and received my a1 sauce. Our drinks were empty and we were asked about refills about ten minutes after our dinner was eaten.. Very terrible service tonight!

Danielle I.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,23,13,1.0,8/18/2013,"NEVER AGAIN. Went here last night haven't been to a BJs since high school and was super excited to have a pizookie. Got to our table ordered food .. The waiter didn't write our order down but I've seen that before, but I was a little nervous when he questioned what I ordered and I had to repeat two times what I said. Food took about 30 minutes to get out and when it did we had still yet to receive utensils and napkins we asked for.. And of course my food order was wrong. when we told the guy who brought it out it was he said he'd take care of it, since he was different from our server he goes to the back about 4 minutes later out actual server comes out with the same plate and says ""this is what you ordered."" I had to hold back laughing at him because I was completely shocked he would come out let alone after the plate had been sitting for a whole and tell me I WAS WRONG. Then says he can just add to the order if what I had wasn't enough. We said no. And he put the plate down since we just settled after being starved. Of course it was cold. Didn't even want to complain because clearly it wouldn't have mattered if that is how customers are treated. I should've known considering when we sat down the table behind us had just complained that their food was cold. Needless to say I didn't get my pizookie so that's sad but I didn't even want to be in the place anymore after being told I was wrong and served cold food.

Spicy to me means enough heat to at least give the feeling of a bit of a ember in the back of my throat but I guess the cook at Bj's thinks it means LETS LIGHT THIS SUCKER ON FIIIIRE!  I couldn't eat it. It really WOULD'VE been good if it wasn't covered in so much heat.  I like BJ's for other aspects and other things they've got on their menu Like the Spinach Artichoke Dip and a few of their deep dish pizzas and maybe a few of their cocktails and beers but I've had to knock a star off because well.. they don't really impress me much anymore.  Service still leaves something to be desired.  The funny thing is, I know I'll still be going to BJ's but I don't have much of a choice for restaurants out here. Its this or Fridays/Chili's..

Adrian S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2014,"CRAPPY FATHERS DAY dinner. This is my first Yelp post and unfortunately if i could give 0 stars i would.  Ive been coming to this restaurant with my family for years. I understand Fathers day is busier than usual but our service was crap and i hope a manager reads this and gets back to me or I will do it right after this.  The plates for my family of six took a long time. (again I understand it was a busy day so we waited patiently).  When the food finally arrived i had to wait another 15-20 minutes for my SALAD. My mom ordered a pepsi after i got my food and we didnt get that until the check came. I suggested to my mom that she shouldnt leave a good tip, but my mom still left her 15% on our $100+ bill. Before we left i asked our waitress if my dad was going to get a Fathers day cup (which is given away every year and we saw everyone getting one). She said ""i dont know anything about cups but ill check to see if maybeee theres something"" we waited for about 15 minutes but decided to head out. Our waitress passed by our table at least 3 times and never got back to us.  As we walked out a bus boy noticed that my dad was empty handed and asked us to wait and gave him a Fathers day cup... i regret the tip the waitress received-she didn't deserve a dime. Unfortunately, i cant remember her name but it may have been Shanna. She had curly blonde hair, early 20s, about 5'5, some acne on her left side...I don't know if shes new or not but her service was just TERRIBLE!

Unfortunately BJ's isn't the only restaurant in that neck of the woods anymore. This place has really gone down hill. My girlfriends and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night. It was busy but nothing like what it used to be. I had requested a booth and a high chair since we had a baby in our group which they kindly accommodated. That's where the good service ends. Our server was sweet, but she took a very, very long time to get over to our table. Our drinks didn't come out fast, mind you, we ordered sodas and iced tea not alcoholic beverages. We didn't put our order in until about 30 minutes after we sat down. She wasn't coming over to our table to often and didn't look our way so we couldn't flag her down. Again sweet girl but hmmmm. My friend and I ordered there $35 special which included a choice of 2 salads, 2 entrees and dessert for 2 people. I thought it was a pretty good deal! Our food didn't come out for another who knows how long. My girlfriends and I couldn't figure out what was taking so long. Again, they weren't all that busy. But we figured something was up because the booth behind us had an issue with their order. The manager came over and offered to comp their meals. He came over again at the same booth (different party) and offered to comp their entire meal. Hmmmm. Where was our apology or comp offer??? Our server, again very sweet, was kind enough to split our checks. My friend and I who ordered the $35 special paid with our credit cards. Our server came over and was going over the receipt with my friend. I was sitting at the end of the booth so didn't peek or really hear the conversation. I tossed my card over and figured everything must have checked out correctly. When my receipt came the total was about $25. It didn't hit me until it was too late. We were overcharged! I understand tax, tip and beverages were not included but I'm still trying to figure out how we each paid $25 (not including tip) for a $35 special for 2! Needless to say I will not be returning, very disappointed.

I've been here twice this week and both times the same problem: horribly slow service.  We seated ourselves in the bar area (maybe that's the problem... bar scum aren't treated as well as the dining area patrons!) and easily waited 10 minutes each time for a server.  By then we had clearly settled on what we wanted to drink (and eat), so we placed our orders and then easily waited about 10 more minutes to get just our drinks!  Compound this slow process by ordering food, ordering more drinks, and then trying to get our check and multiply it by two (for the two evenings there) and you get: two stars. The only reason BJ's doesn't get one star is that their Espresso-Tini, salads, and desserts were good. ... oh Oxnard, couldn't you do better?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oxnard?start=400

We were seated at a great large round booth located by a window in about 15 minutes.  I highly recommend when you arrive for any meal, see if you can get a table serviced by Dillion.  What a great waiter!  He gave us a little run down of BJ's since it was our first time there and he seem to really like working for this company.  Somehow the subject of root beer came up and he said they make a fantastic one.  My husband asked for a sample and he ended up bringing two large glasses for each couple to share!  It was very yummy. We ordered their hot wings and while they were a little spicy for me, the guys really liked them.  My hubby ordered a thin crust basil and cheese pizza as he knew he would be eating at least 1/2 of my delicious barbeque chopped chicken salad - which was huge!  The size of their salads put California Pizza Kitchen's to shame.  My friend ordered their Italian deli salad (think that is what it was called) and she took at least half of it home.  Her husband had the beef dip sandwich with huge delicious steak fries.   Dillion came over several times to check on us and my friend jokingly  mentioned ice cream would be great in the root beer.  Not five minutes had passed and here came Dillion again with another ""sample"" root beer with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream!  She was in heaven.   Dillion brought our check and said there was no hurry, just wanted to give it to us when ever we were ready.  We felt no pressure to leave, even though there was a lot of people waiting for a table.

First off their was no wait which was surprising as their is always a long wait to get seated. But then we waited over 30 minutes before our food came, and the worst part is the food came cold. 2 of us at the table received their food and 2 of us had to wait another 5 minutes. Unacceptable!! If I have to wait 30 minutes for my food it better be good! I sent it back, and the manager was apologetic and gave me free soup and another plate, but I had already lost my appetite.  Which brings me to think the restaurant set up is all wrong, cooking area should have been centralized to the servers dont have to go far for the orders.

sunny b.,"San Fernando, CA",0,21,,1.0,8/25/2012,I have been going to this oxnard Bj since it opened. Well done place with good atmosphere. The pot roast was my fav. In this bad economy I noticed alot of places have been using cheaper ingredients for their dishes and still charging the same. My pot roast used to be soft and tender simmering in sauce. The carrots were cooked soft and hot  Now the same pot roast is prefab tv dinner. Not even cooked at all  microwave beef chunks with some can brown salty sauce on top. Carrots right out of the plactic bag uncooked cold and bland. $15 wasted.

I must say that it's probably one of the best Chicago style pizza over here. I had some mustard ish sandwhich which was not that good. I do not recommend the sandwhiches but pizza is a good solid bet.  I love the beer that they ""brew"" there ( I hear that they the restaurants don't always brew the restaurants onsite). The sampler is pretty cool. I do love the Blonde beer.  They have pretty good happy hours there as well. The lettuce wraps and the drinks are I believe 50 percent off.  They do offer a HUGE Pizzoukie where you share with 5 or 6 of your friends. I believe you can even mix several types of cookies.

Steven T.,"New York, NY",16,39,,3.0,4/22/2009,"This place has delicious food, service is a juggle, depends who you get..I think at this location, the male servers are more friendly and attentive (no offense). Tonight I got the clam chowder in a sourdough breadloaf, and it's always so good and fulfilling, with a glass of chardonnay. I also like their meatball sandwich from here with wedge cut fries, the bbq chicken pizza is also tasty, sometimes the bbq sauce is a bit overpowering, so i tell them light on the sauce. the pastas here aren't so great, so i suggest skipping that part of the menu. the roast beef is pretty good, comes with mash potatoes and steamed veggies. spinach artichoke dip here is ok as well, nothing spectacular. let me think of the salads... ceasars ok, crisp chicken can be skipped, it's so pointless to 'try' and eat healthy with that since the chicken is deep fried, might as well get a burger. bbq chicken salad is probably my fav salad there. california burger is good on sourdough. let's go to desserts... known for their pizookies, it's a baked cookie in a silver platter ala mode (topped with ice cream) it's good, you can choose from three types of cookies, choc.chip, white choc macadamia, or oatmeal raisin. so bj's really is just a chain restaurant that offers comfort food, and they have a pretty good variety of items to choose from and they're also known for the beer they brew there.

As most everyone knows The Dallas Cowboys football team is in town for pre season camp.The manager mentions that like 14 football players are on their way and they will be siting here. Well, I'm a RAIDER fan, so my response is lets get the hell out of here, the restaurant was already full with a bunch of cowboy freak fans so I wanted out! Well by the time the pazookie and check were all done...Here they come 14 real big people, one of them was a big man. So here was Terrell Owens and 13 family members. Mr. Personality sat across from me and stared, and stared not at my wife but me!. I couldn't shake him. I know I'm ugly but  negro please!

He later received his sandwich when we got our meals and we had to ask for his soup before it was brought out. Who does that, bring out the adults food and not the kids? My son was like, ""mom where is my food, where is mine?""  We tried to give my husbands soup to him, but he wanted the one that was supposed to be his. So he munched on some of my salad till his food came, about 10 minutes later.  My pizza was pretty greasy and a little tasteless. Other food was average, but customer service lacks.  If it weren't for the prices, i would have given a 1 star.

Lunch was fine, Avocado rolls were a little spicy. The kids liked the spaghetti. I tried their Maibach (sp) beer and it was pretty good. Pizookie was excellent. When walking to the restrooms, I noticed the brewery equipment and while looking in I saw a nice long line of ants behind the glass walls no doubt getting their drink on.

We checked out BJs on yelp and noticed that it didn't get great reviews all the way around, but we decided to go there anyway and see for ourselves. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (as they are a popular place), but we are glad we waited!! We don't know what everyone else is taking about! The service was just about the best I have ever seen!! The waitress never let my water glass get more than half empty, the food came out fast, and the waitress was incredibly nice!! We got the Artichoke and Spinach Dip appetizer; it was REALLY good and the tortilla chips were freshly made!  I got the Angus Roast Beef Dip, which was a tad dry if you don't use the au jus, plus I didn't get the onions on it so that might have had something to do with the slight dryness, but the flavor was great! My friend got the California Burger and she said it was awesome!! I got water to drink (which can be iffy at some places) and my friend got the Nutty Brewnette beer. Both drinks were very good! The seasoned fries that came with the entrees were very good as well!! Also, for the sports fans, they have several TVs behind the bar and throughout the restaurant showing several different sports channels. The prices are quite reasonable as well!
