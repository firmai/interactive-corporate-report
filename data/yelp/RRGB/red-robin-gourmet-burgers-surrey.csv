Bonnie C.,"Surrey, Canada",200,112,181,4.0,8/31/2017,"Finally got the chance to come here for the first time ever! My friends had been raving about their burgers for the longest time, so I had fairly high expectations. First things first: this is a family restaurant. If you're not a fan of children, avoid this place. Parking isn't bad, since it's at Guildford mall. If you're showing up with a party of 2-4, wait times to get tables aren't too bad. Their strawberry lemonades are delicious, and refillable, so that was very sugary filled. My friends and I all ordered burgers, I got the Garden Burger and added avocados. My friends got the Banzai, with a veggie patty. That second burger has pineapples in it, so if you're a fan of sweet with savory, you'd probably enjoy it. Wait times once our food order went in took quite a while, and we had to wave someone down to ask them to find our waiter a few times, so that was a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if they were short staffed, or our waiter was swamped with another larger table, but yeah. That happened.  The long waits once seated probably would've been harder to endure had it not been for the bottomless fries. Things I did not know beforehand: it's possible to get fries first before the burgers show up. I wish I had known that prior, I would've been quite a lot less hangry by the time the food finally showed up. Thankfully, the food was 10/10 amazing, which is part of the reason why I'm rounding up from a 3.5 to a 4/5. Will have to return and see if they've truly earned that 4/5 though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey

Deepak H.,"Surrey, Canada",5,54,92,4.0,5/30/2017,"I've been here so many times I've lost count. Best tip I can provide is to make a reservation before arriving, and to also to provide your order ahead of time so as you arrive it is ready and served immediately. This is the reason why I gave it +1 star from my original 3.  I have a signed on their royalty rewards membership and had a deal where one fire-grilled gourmet burger is 50% off with a purchase of another burger. A great deal to share a meal with anyone.  We arrived here for a quick work lunch and I ordered the wedgie burger. The second time we came back for lunch I got the BBQ whiskey river burger with no cheese. Both times we ordered ahead and made reservations. I have a great deal of respect for the staff working who were prompt with everyone's orders and bills.  Food was great, burgers were hot and not lukewarm like previous times I ate here. Interior is still the same old red robins feel. But that doesn't really matter, it's all about their burgers which are always delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey
Robin W.,"Auburn, WA",20,50,33,5.0,3/19/2017,Went in for some drinks before the movie on a busy saturday.  Was seated promptly at the bar as requested ...ordered some moscule mules as they were on special $5 great deal and they were on point. Didn't order no food but stayed for over a hour drinking and service was great.  Overheard the couple beside us complaining about their dry wings and the bartender wasted no time to tell them he would be taking them off there bill.

It was my first time ever coming here and because of our servers attention to detail I will definitely be back.

Juliet X.,"Surrey, Canada",2,11,2,4.0,3/13/2017,"Service is usually good when I eat in, even when they're busy the service is still good/nice, and for takeout too.  Bottomless fries are great, unfortunately not seasoned when ordering for takeout, so make sure to ask. I usually order their teriyaki chicken burger, which is about $13 with fries and always fills me up before I can finish them.  Their onion ring tower is really good, but I find $13 for the tower kind of pricey considering it's just onions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey

Sterling W.,"South Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada",0,1,,1.0,10/23/2017,"My party and I were disgusted with the way we were treated on October 22nd, 2017. We made a reservation for 12 people at 5pm, celebrating multiple birthdays in our group. When we arrive, we are told by the assistant manager that a large group is sitting at our table and they have finished their meal, we just have to wait for them to clear out.  An hour later , that group is still sitting there and Red Robins management won't say a word to the group but is content on letting us wait. Normal restaurants communicate time limits to their patrons...otherwise whats the point of a reservation?  Feed up with this predicament, we ask to split  our table into groups of 6 to expedite the wait. The staff has a miscommunication and our request was not communicated properly for another 45 minutes! Long story short, we waited over 2 hours to get our tables. A 5pm reservation turned into 7pm and management did nothing for us to make up for their blunder.  Disappointments after disappointments. I am someone who eats here every few months but I will never go to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey

C. H.,"Burnaby, Canada",19,797,3880,3.0,3/22/2016,I have not set foot into this chain for quite some time and the menu has improved. Now there is big list of bottomless items including carrots and broccoli for those looking for healthy options. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger. I miss the paper that they used to wrap the burger with so that the drippings did not get all over my hands. Who remember those days which included the burger on a red basket with the side of fries? Now the chain aims for a more higher end feel with the silver tins to hold the fries on white plates. The fries are always perfect - never been served soggy fries. My burger was good as expected. Service was slow. It seems that the restaurant was not prepared for the large weekend crowds. Tables were not cleared and cleaned. Long line ups at the door. Our server was running around that it took awhile to place our orders and get our food. Obviously the restaurant was understaffed that day. 3.5 star experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey
Corinna C.,"Surrey, Canada",2,40,73,1.0,7/27/2017,"Red Robin's used to be one of our favourite places to have a burger. Then they got rid of the s, and changed the furniture. And since we have returned the service and the food quality have gone downhill dramatically.  Tonight we went - the first time in many months. A Thursday night, so you think it would be busy. Months ago we would have had to wait 20+ minutes. Not tonight.  Service was SLOW. Like, really slow. And when the waitress showed up, she would do only half a job. She would drop something off... but not pick up the empty plates or bring pop refills. In fact, I waited so long for my one refill that we left an almost full glass of pop.  The food. My boyfriend ordered a black and blue burger. He received some sort of mushroom burger. We didn't bother saying anything because the service was so slow, and she was nowhere to be found.  I ordered chicken fajitas. I ordered this same dish a couple of years ago and t was amazing. With tonight's dish, the chicken was fantastic. The vegetables were bland, and looked like the scraps. Very unappealing!! It will be a long time - if ever - that we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey

Does it get any better?  It does. BOTTOMLESS FRIES!! And drinks!!! That alone deserves 3 stars. The extra star is for their yummilicious burgers!!

Stephy Y.,"Richmond, Canada",103,515,1238,4.0,10/21/2015,"I happen to be around Surrey/Burnaby area and read up on the reviews that the service at the Burnaby location is pretty bad so we decided to hit up the one near Guildford Mall instead.  There was a huge line-up when we arrived and the servers seemed overly busy discussing where to seat all of these hungry diners. Well, I know for sure I was. Arrived at 13:00 and haven't eaten a thing since 4:00.  When we put our names down, they asked if we were over 19, which I thought was quite silly since we weren't planning on ordering any alcohol. My friend did make a comment that most of the helpers looked like they were under 19 and it is confirmed (we asked). Most are, but those that serve alcohol are at least 19.  I don't remember the name of our server, but she was really nice. We order the pumpkin spice milkshake and I just had water because I couldn't fit bottomless fries with bottomless pop and a huge burger in my little tummy in one sitting. For the burger, we had the Black & Bleu and Bleu Ribbon Burger. I also subbed my regular bun to a ciabatta bun at no cost. The kitchen staff was either super busy or they are just slow. We waited for 30 minutes and our order wasn't coming. Could also be that we were on a tight schedule so we had to get our burgers to go. Our server was very accommodating with that and had it bagged for us to go in a short while.  So...no bottomless fries for me. But I'm not much of a fries person anyways, so I didn't care too much. I did put some pepper & salt with some ketchup on my fries not knowing that they had provided the packages for us in the bag.  Down to the real deal of this review. The burgers were exquisite. My burger was the Blue Ribbon Burger. I had a blast of blue cheese in my mouth. The patty was succulent and juicy and had just the right amount of sauce. I must admit this is one of the most delicious burgers I've had. I also liked that my burger wasn't overly stuffed with veggies. I hate how the liquid from the veggies get the bun all soggy. My friend said his burger was good too but have had just as good for a cheaper price. His being the premium burger it cost around $16 and was $5 more than mines. The fries were surprisingly good too. It actually didn't need any seasoning and would have tasted better on its own. Now, I wish I had that bottomless option. Oh well, next time.  The milkshake, however, was a no no. It was pretty small and it didn't have any of the pumpkin spice I was looking for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey
Daniel N.,"New Westminster, Canada",50,88,64,5.0,12/4/2016,"My experience at the Red Robin on Robson was meh so I kinda hesitated to come here. However, this location deserves total 5 stars for outstanding customer service even though the restaurant was very busy on a Saturday night. Pop was constantly refilled, garlic herbed fries were hot and fresh when served (not to mention bottomless), and the Prime Chophouse burger was phenomenal. Everything tasted great and the staff is very competent. Will comeback to try the bottomless sweet potato fries for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey

Maneki N.,"Surrey, Canada",0,66,,2.0,9/10/2015,"My husband and I came in about an hour before closing. It took more than 4 minutes for us to be seated in a section full of dirty tables, and then a further 6 minutes before anyone came over to our table and asked us for drink orders. Though we were polite and courteous, it was clear that our server wanted to go home by the way avoided our table. Our food came out fast and was good, but the service was really lacking. She never came back to ask how everything was or if we wanted refills of all of the bottomless items they offer (a great deal of them). She only came back to drop our check.

samuel a.,"Vancouver, Canada",159,368,80,3.0,11/12/2010,"Now the only Red Robin in Surrey after they closed the Newton location.  This place hasn't changed ONE BIT in 15 years. One could argue their menu hasn't changed either (it has - a little bit).  The burgers used to be on the top of the heap but they've since been passed by a bunch of other upstarts because RR doesn't evolve their product. The burgers are good, no doubt, but they need a better patty - go fresh people.  But one thing can be said of consistency. The red baskets with the burger and endless fries is something we can all identify with.  What I ordered was the Banzai burger, which is good and upgraded the fries to the poutine - BAD MOVE. Small portion, and a little gravy with a few cheese curds (8 to be exact).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=40

Anthony W.,"Surrey, Canada",37,63,8,3.0,11/16/2010,"I want to begin. I have always been a fan of Red Robin and always probably will be. I have always been satisfied when I've left their restaurant and especially this location. I was heartbroken when I learned they no longer have Dr Pepper on tap/fountain soft drink since they moved to Coca Cola products.  I don't have no beef against Coke. In Canada, Dr Pepper is distributed by Pepsi Co. With this change I don't believe there's a restaurant in Western Canada that has Dr Pepper fountain. I would greatly appreciate it if someone knows where they serve Dr Pepper fountains. That way, I'm happy face and my soul returneths.  That aside I ordered the Chili Chili Burger. It was VERY yummy to my tummy. I found the burger too small and was served like a Sloppy Joe (and I like Sloppy Joes - not sloppy seconds). I would have it again, of course.

Peter E.,"Richmond, Canada",32,110,276,3.0,1/21/2016,I decided to take my wife here for her birthday lunch after spending a butt load of cash on some awesome stuff at the mall for my wife. We were seated right away and you can tell it was starting to get busy.  I had to flag down a server and told her that we had been quite a while just to get some one to take our orders. She was very apologetic and decided to own this situation. She was very professional and friendly. We ordered two wedgie burgers with a side salad and a tower of onion rings. I just say that we were not disappointed. I felt better for not ordering the bun and fries that normally come with a burger. Try it. I actually had to set aside a few leaves of lettuce cuz there was so much of it. I should explain that a wedgie burger is a burger without the bun and instead you get a load of lettuce. Quite good. The server came by later and knew that we were still a bit miffed about the previous wait but we really had gotten over it. She decided to take the appetizer off the bill as a gesture of good will. NOTE: the other server working the same section or close to our table screwed up their order twice and sent an order to another table in error as well.

I always like to going to Red Robin's and Im usually the one who suggests this restaurant. I have been here many times over the past 10 years that we have lived here. The food is consistently good, but I agree with another Yelper who said the fries are sparse. They used to top up the fries, I am not sure if they still do. They do top up the sodas which I do like. The service is usually friendly and reasonably fast considering how busy this place ALWAYS is. PLEASE NOTE - ALWAYS BUSY! Friday nights and Saturdays are going to have a wait time. My biggest complaint is how LOUD it is in the restaurant. My hubby, sister and mom have all complained about this. The ceiling looks like it could be tin which reflects sound making the place LOUD when busy. If your looking for a good burger with nice servers, consider this Red Robin location in Guildford :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Miranda R.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,13,,1.0,8/5/2014,"The service was awful. We always enjoy the food, but we waited for menus for 15 minutes after being seated. Then waited 10 more for water. No apologies were given, or any reason as to why we were always forgotten. After waiting and waiting to give our order, we just left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Tommy A.,"Surrey, Canada",0,5,,5.0,2/18/2016,This review is long overdue.  I have been going to this location for a while.  Every time we go there there's always wait.   Even if the staff says there's 15 to 20 minutes wait they usually get you in within 10 minutes the most.  The reason I'm writing this review is because of the staff.   This location has an amazing staff.  They are very courteous polite and attentive.   The food is always consistent.   If you order their burgers or other items of the menu you know it will be the same every time.   It's a good family environment.   This is a very tightly run crew.   Kudos to the managers  you're doing a great job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Izzy S.,"Surrey, Canada",4,22,19,4.0,1/25/2013,"I've only been to Red Robin's a handful of times, even though I know it's been around for years. I thought by this time the franchise would be pretty low on the popularity chain. For some reason I've been here maybe three times in the last year and every time it's been PACKED. It seems like ""the"" place for birthday parties at any age, maybe because they sing you a special song, or maybe it's just the bottomless fries that are still as good as I remembered them in the 90's. I personally am addicted to the bottomless raspberry limeade. Love the energy here, the staff is always very friendly, efficient and accommodating.  A tip if you're looking for honey mustard - apparently they don't have it. But ask for ""honey poppyseed"". It's a sweet dressing/dip that's way better than any honey mustard I've ever had!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Aaron D.,"Toronto, Canada",0,11,,5.0,12/22/2014,"Keith greeted me at the door and was warm, organized and on fleek. Service was amazing and Pam ensured all of our needs were met, very bubbly and cheery.  Surprisingly amazing service, never thought I would say that about a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Kristina D.,"Surrey, Canada",10,50,9,4.0,4/20/2013,"Red robin always has such great service ! There used to be two locations in surrey, but one of them closed, and now this one is always so busy that you have to wait for a table anytime on a weekend.  The food is great , but they took the quesadillas off the menu , which used to be my favourite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Louis F.,"Surrey, Canada",0,13,,4.0,11/30/2014,"Nothing specific to complain about, but it wasn't all that memorable of an experience. The service was okay, the food was fine, which earns it 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
Sean L.,"Surrey, Canada",1,11,1,5.0,8/2/2014,Wow! Incredible service that was very quick despite it being very busy. The food was amazing. I had the bonzai burger. I'll be going back for sure!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surrey?start=20
