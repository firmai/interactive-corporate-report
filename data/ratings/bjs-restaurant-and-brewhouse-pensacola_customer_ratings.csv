17,Emily F.,"Pensacola, FL",98,51,8.0,2.0,2016-04-21,I have been to BJs in other cities. So we were excited to finally have one here. We decided to go on Wednesday April 20th at 7:30pm. We used the app to check in on the wait list before we got to the restaurant. On the app it said there were tables open with no wait. When we arrived we were told we were checked in and it would be a few minutes. We ended up waiting for a table for 45 minutes. After 20 minutes I asked the hostess how much longer it would be and was told 10 minutes. When I asked why I was told it would only be a few minutes they shrugged and walked away. There was a woman wearing a suit type jacket with several pins who was obviously the trainer since it is opening week. She was very rude. If she is the one training the hostesses I don't have much hope for them.  Once we were finally seated the service was very slow. I know it's opening week so I tried to be open minded. But I had to ask for a refill three times and extra sauce twice.  We are loyalty members and we were never asked for our loyalty member number. I had to flag down the woman training our waitress to get her to add our loyalty number to our table.  Everything we ordered was great. Pizzas and burgers. Of course the pizookies were the best part.  Overall the food was good. But the experience was horrible. Maybe they'll get it together after a few weeks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

62,Cynthia G.,"Pensacola, FL",21,45,6.0,1.0,2016-04-24,"I love BJ's but not this one.  I understand it's opening week but the service was terribly slow.  I hope they get it together as I really enjoy all the BJ's in California.  When calling to make a reservation they did not explain it wasn't a reservation but basically getting on a waiting list, this was extremely misleading especially being that I have a baby.  The hostess needs people skills, I understand some are new but one that seemed to be training her needs people skills as well.  We were there for 3 hours so not cool.  The avocado egg rolls did not taste the same.  We tried the brussel sprouts and they were so salty we had to send them back.  The ahi tuna salad was perfect.  When we ordered our Poozoki we waited for 45 minutes.  The waitress hardly came around and kept forgetting our drinks.  I hope in 3 more months they get it together.  Ps. The bar service was amazing.  Drinks were good and the bartenders were very attentive and personable.  The bar area gets 4 stars and the restaurant 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=80,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.076000000000001
0,Marianne K.,"Pensacola, FL",66,33,12.0,3.0,2016-04-25,Service wasn't the greatest but it could be because it just opened. The server seemed very distracted and didn't even look at us.

57,James B.,"San Diego, CA",3,19,4.0,2.0,2016-05-06,"So I arrived at the establishment on a Friday evening and placed my name on the waiting list for a party of 2. 40 min wait, cool. The hostess mentioned that I could grab a beer while I wait so I did. Ordered a beer from the bar, asked the bartender if I could take it outside and her response was ""you're not supposed to but it's okay"".. Well apparently it's not ""okay"" because one of the staff members told me I can't have my beer outside after I was already outside drinking my beer (keep in mind the lobby is packed with people). If it's not ""okay"" then your BARTENDER should not tell people it is. Got seated, the waitress didn't know much about the menu from the two questions I asked. Ordered a ""queso dip and chips"" with equated to warmed up velveeta cheese with some chopped up tomatoes on top. The cheese tip at Taco Bell is better. Don't recommend. The food arrived within a reasonable time considering how busy the place was. One side item was left off of one dish because they ran out of the item, but it was replaced with a new one. Portions were average, food flavor was bland, and temperature of food was warm. Overall, it was an ""ehhh"" experience. For $38 for two people (two entrees, a beer, and app) I wouldn't recommend. Nothing great, and definitely nothing waiting 30+ minutes for. I probably won't be going back with so many other better options around the same area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=60,3.4960000000000004,3.4960000000000004,3.4960000000000004,3.4960000000000004,3.496000000000001

It's a new place and you can tell. But a good option over the usual chain restaurants,  looking at you applebees and chili's. The brews are good, and a fair amount of tvs. Would consider sitting at the bar for GameDay over Ale house or twin peaks. All in all decent new spot in town.

You will want to be patient because of the hype of a new restaurant in town.  As for the food, the deep dish pizza is great.  Their in house brews are pretty good (the jeremiah red is strong as hell).  I would highly recommend locals or folks visiting mutliple times to download the bj's app to avoid wait times. You can log into the app and get on the wait list from home!

32,Phil A.,"Milton, FL",4,63,146.0,5.0,2016-05-22,"I can't stand reading people's reviews on chain restaurants.. Especially when the restaurant is actually really good and doesn't deserve a poor review. Reading through these comments I saw a ""grown man"" who gave a 2 star review because he didn't like that they had a revolving door.. 1. If $14 is an expensive meal to you, please stay home or go to Mcdonalds. 2. You can't say in a review how you realize they just opened yet your upset that they are busy or fine tuning some aspects of their business.. Off my soap box.  The ACTUAL review: My wife and I used to love going to BJ's back in the DC area, and were so excited when we heard they were opening up a BJ's down here! We have so far gone to this new BJ's twice, both times during peak hour, and the wait times were not anything more than to be expected. The staff were always very friendly, and admittedly, for how many tables our waitress had the last time we were there, my wife and I were surprised she even attempted to chat with us!  The calamari was cooked very well and the seasonings were very good. Whenever I go without my wife I get the Avocado egg roles (wife is allergic to avocado, what a shitty thing to be allergic to?) if you have never tried them, I HIGHLY recommend them! We also ordered their ""hard"" root beer which was very tasty! My wife and I both order their Deep dish pizza every time we go and like to try different ones; we haven't found one yet we can honestly say we didn't like. The BJ's Classic is an everything pizza which is always fantastic, and the Mediterranean is great if you enjoy olives, artichoke, feta, etc! My wife and I rarely, if ever, order dessert at a restaurant, but I definitely recommend trying a pazookie (how you pronounce that silly word, I have no clue.) If you can't decide on one flavor you can always just get the trio and try three different flavors!  The prices aren't over the top, but apparently people in this area find a $13 meal to be outrageous..? If this is truly outrageous you can always get their coupons on your phone for $10 off or half off pizza on Mondays Etc.. If you don't want a wait, don't go during peak hours..? Common sense things here people.. But, if you don't like a restaurant that has a revolving door and you want to cry about it, you probably just suck as a human being in general.. BJ's has great food, an AMAZING selection, and a great drink selection as well! Definitely recommend you trying it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=20,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636

We were so excited when we saw that one was opening up here but were very disappointed after our first visit. I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken and the meal would have been good if they used a better quality of chicken. It was so gross, hard to cut because it was tough/chewy, dry, and like stringy almost. This is a bummer because everything I love at BJ's includes chicken. It must be because they get their meat from somewhere else than the Gainesville location but they need to fix that or it may even be frozen. My fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich and wasn't a fan, it was just okay. We did order the mini pizookie trio because you can't go to BJ's and not get a pizookie and they were still as delicious as ever.

13,Des D.,"Pensacola, FL",0,25,23.0,4.0,2016-06-06,"This restaurant deserves a decent review.  I've read about BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, mostly on the National Restaurant Association's website, and mostly concerning their financial success. Because I've never seen one, or heard much about it, I haven't given it much thought. Having been there now I must say I am impressed. This is a very nice place. It has a modern, upscale, gastro pub/sports bar environment. I didn't see any children, and honestly it's not a place for children. There is a children's menu and I'm sure they are welcome, but right off the top it looks and feels like an adult establishment. We went on Sunday night at 6:00. The parking lot was full and I assumed there would be a wait, but I had no idea how large this place was inside and we were seated immediately. (There was a wait line when we left.) There are tables, high tables, and booths. The very first thing you notice when you come in is the bar. It's massive, and the colorful lighting is beautifully striking. The back wall is covered with their beer offerings. If you are a beer connoisseur there's enough to keep you busy for days. BJ's has their own handcrafted beers, there are locally crafted beers, there are micro brews, there are seasonal beers, flavored beers, and quite a variety of German ales, stouts, blondes, etc. When you are seated they hand you a menu which looks like overnight reading material. The first 6 pages are all alcohol related. They serve everything. From a wide variety of appetizers, to steaks,  pasta,  seafood, ribs, sandwiches and burgers, you will find something to eat today, and want to try several more items on future visits. The food is nicely executed and impressive. There's no doubt that you are in a 2016 restaurant that keeps up with the trends. In 1978 BJ's was originally a pizza restaurant in Orange County, CA. so it's no surprise that the menu includes an entire pizza section. They specialize in Chicago style pizza. We didn't get the pizza, but saw a lot of it coming out of the kitchen, and it's something to try next time- maybe a small one as an appetizer.  The prices are reasonable, rivaling chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's, but slightly more costly. Personally I thought the quality of the food is much better and worth the price.  Do not go expecting an inexpensive meal, but it's not going to break your wallet unless you're adding alcohol to the bill. This BJ's location has been open since April. That has given them 2 months to work out their opening kinks. The restaurant was busy and bustling and runners were continuously taking food out of the kitchen. There seems to be no shortage of staff. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and offered suggestions and favorites. She was also very busy, so when my adult son's food came out and ours didn't until 12 minutes later there was no one to tell. My server is my liaison with the kitchen. If there's a problem I can't go in and ask, ""Where's my order?"" I rely on her to do that. When she did show up she went to check on it, then told us she was looking for the manager, but couldn't find her. Like I said, the restaurant is very big and very busy so I wasn't surprised, but I did want this resolved quickly. I had ordered the pasta with jumbo meatballs, which was awesome, but not hot. Luckily, I like my pasta more warm than hot, however it should have been run to the table much, much sooner. Still my meal was wonderful. It was not Italian restaurant pasta, it was bistro- style with meatballs that were huge, handmade, and delicious. There was enough to eat, and plenty left over to take home. I would certainly order it again. My husband ordered the fried jalapeno burger and said it was good. My son's brisket burger was beautiful. I tried some of the smoked brisket on top and it was smokey, peppery, and delicious. Aside from the glitch with our order we had a very nice experience. I don't think we can expect the crowds to die down here. At this location I believe this is going to be a popular place in Pensacola. To minimize the wait there is a BJ's app. with"" Preferred  Wait."" I didn't use it so I don't know much about it, but it's worth testing. We will go back, there are lots and lots of menu items I would like to try. The steak and ribs looks amazing, and the monkey bread with ice cream will have to wait.  Oh, and they did take my meal off the price of the ticket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.536,3.7200000000000006
12,Rick B.,"Pensacola, FL",1,23,,4.0,2016-06-06,"First time there on a not busy Monday evening. Waiter was very attentive, appeared moments after we were seated checking on drinks. They have a very extensive beer list including some brewed in their own brewery in Texas. I had a nut brown ale, which was well done. My guest had a amber which was OK.  Allen stopped by a couple times while we were perusing the 13 page menus. It had the beers, and wines as well as food.  They have a few appetizers and soups, two different pizzas, thin and deep dish. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, pasta and deserts. Oh yea and quinoa bowls, and a kale / Brussels sprout salad. There has to be something for every one there.  We had the thin crust tomato basil mozzarella pizza for $13. I wasn't sure it would be enough for two so ordered a  hickory BBQ burger with BBQ pork and bacon and a meat patty. It came with shoestring fries, again about $13.  The pizza was tasty and plenty for two, the frys were crisp and not oily. We ate those two and brought the burger home. Dinner with tax was $40 and we over ordered.  Nice place, not too noisy, decent food. Lots of TVs with sports.

30,Thomas C.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,58,1.0,4.0,2016-06-11,"I generally don't enjoy chain restaurants. They're stale and unenjoyable experiences that make you wish you had stayed at home.  BJ's flies in the face of that feeling. It's a vibrant and open restaurant with a nice menu, good food and a cool atmosphere that is enjoyable.  At the time of this writing the restaurant is still fairly new to the area only being open a couple months. I imagine they're starting to iron out some of the opening problems that other reviewers mentioned as I didn't experience any of them.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive throughout the meal. We had fried asparagus that had a nice flavor and kept its crisp bite after cooking. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Not a dish I normally order anywhere, but I was feeling froggy and jumped. It was really nice and actually had a good little bit of heat. My wife had a seared tuna salad and enjoyed it.

I enjoyed the BJ's Stout beer and my pizza.  The pizza was perfectly cooked, deep dish, with fresh veggies and lots of cheese.  Perfection.  In fact, so much perfection, I had to take half of it home in a box. Our server was quick, attentive, and answered any questions I had.  She did warn us that the steaks and ribs are hit and miss.  They're known for their pizza and beer, not their steaks.  I was happy to hear a server be candid and not try and up-sell at every turn. Looking around, the burgers and pasta dishes looked pretty darn good, too.  There's a dessert, called a Pizookie that's a pizza/cookie covered in ice cream made by angels.  They even have a monkey break Pizookie.  I didn't have room for it this trip, but I guarantee that I'll be back for at least one, as long as my doctor doesn't find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola,4.2,4.2,4.2,2.8640000000000003,4.2

I've been getting the gluten free pizza lately, which to be honest reminds me of a frozen pizza..but don't let that throw you off.  It's like a good version of a cheap pizza I grew up on, I love it. The only complaints I have, which I'm so hoping will be fixed with time (since it's new) is the time we have to wait for the food and drinks to be served, and how cold it is in there. I'll be honest the last time I went, it was a great temp, but the other times..I've been frozen..and I don't get cold often. I think that the design of the restaurant is what is leading to some of the wait times being so long. Although I did mention that it takes too long to get food and the waiter said there are some issues with the kitchen staff (apparently attitudes). We've been when it was busy and when it was slow, still had to wait longer than normal to get our food. I do think some of the waiters are just really inexperienced. The previous time we went we had a great waiter named Zac. I do think the menu is way too overwhelming but oh well, at least there's variety. We use the app every time, we've used it to be put on the list, and there's a ton of deals they send to your email.

23,Ryan B.,"Pensacola, FL",96,17,16.0,3.0,2016-10-31,"BJ's has the right idea. The beers are actually, quite good for a chain restaurant. Their menu has plenty of options to choose from and every time I come the food is delicious. I've tried a few of the appetizers, including the avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers; both very good. For my main dish I've had the Cobb salad, flat bread pizza, and tonight I had the Jambalaya, on the recommendation of my server. All very good. However; I was a little uneasy about the price of the jambalaya. How corporate can justify 17.00 for chicken, andouille sausage, rice, and seasoning, is far beyond me.     My next issue, which again is at the corporate level, is the floor plan. Well, what does that have to do with a Yelp review? Wait times. Service is so slow because the bar and kitchen are so far away, from over half of the seating area. If your server has over 2 tables, expect very slow service. That is a lot of walking back and forth for them to do; so I try to keep that in mind when I'm there.     All in all, great food, good beer, decent service.

The food all looked great and everyone at our table of seven loved their food. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. My only complaint would be that there were two ketchup bottles at our table and both were empty. If you are going to take the time to go get ketchup for your table at least make sure it's full when you bring it to the table. The cooks did a great job preparing all the food and it was all brought out in a timely manner. The restaurant including the restrooms was very clean.

I had the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the sauce the used in top was delicious.As for dessert, I order the beignet topped wiyh strawberries and ice creams which was okay as well. I would day a 3/5.

The portions are good and the calorie count HIGH.  I had the Ziti and it was 1400 calories.  I don't normally look at calorie count, but when it's posted, Yeah, I look.   I give it a $$ for food and $$$ for beer and wine.  The place get 3.5 stars for roominess and atmosphere.  A lively sports bar kind of setting with a long bar and lots of sitting area within the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

On a positive note, at least all roadkill does not go to waste. I ordered a house salad with ranch, the easiest thing on the menu and received a dry bowl of weeds. The famous Pizookie was even nearly uneatable being over cooked. Don't order the snickerdoodle unless you are up to a cinnamon challenge. This once great go to restaurant has seen a serious downturn.

Plenty of chicken and brown rice with a tomato based sauce and baby Brussels sprouts. I saved half to go home because it was a generous portion. Yes, we ordered the salted caramel Pizookie which is a cookie baked in a small pizza pan and covered in ice cream.  Divinely  good.  We also had an adult beverage.
