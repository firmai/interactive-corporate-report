Nicole H.,Fredericksburg  VA,1,35,22,12/5/2017,4.0,So  I went with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon/early evening. Ok at 4! We were immediately seated  it was busy  but not overly crowded. Atmosphere was really nice. Busy  but nice. Seemed family friendly. Our server Marky Mark (he says it's on his birth certificate)  knew his stuff. He knew the menu front and back. Very  very personable  tons of fun. Needless to say  at the end of the evening he got a good tip. From all of us. Now for the food. Appetizers: cheese curds (I'd never had them) delicious. Hot. Cheesy. Sweet potato fries. Not a fan on sugar and cinnamon on mine  but my compadre did and before she added it  I was enjoying them. Maybe a little too crunchy but still good. Some kind of flat bread thing with jalapeos and a bunch of veggies I like. Amazing! For the main dish I got jambalaya. It was spicy  but not quite as much flavor as I would've liked. Either way  still a good dish. My companions had meals that looked equally delicious  but no one was in the sharing mood. Dessert. I had the baked beigne that came with ice cream and whipped cream. Still good. Needless to say  I walked out of there STUFFED! Definitely going again. And again. Aaand again.
Beth F.,Cabin John  MD,0,3,,11/22/2017,1.0,Service sucked. We sat down in the bar area. We waited 15 minutes before someone came to wait on us. My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl. The chowder was so thick it looked like mashed potatoes. The bread bowl was hard as a rock. We also ordered wings; 5 cheery glaze and 5 dry rubbed sriracha. They forgot to put the sriracha dry run on them. We mentioned something to our waitress and she said she would be right back she was going to get a little bowl of the rub for us. No she did NOT offer to take the wings back!!! It took 10 minutes to get the rub for us to put on our wings ourselves! Just all around awful!!!! Awful everything. It's a bunch of kids working who have no idea about customer service or work ethic. And whoever is cooking back in the kitchen  needs a few cooking lessons. This place will be out of business before next winter.
B H.,Fredericksburg  VA,12,53,3,10/2/2017,1.0,"First of all ~ we love the BJ\'s concept and have enjoyed many of their locations. This newer location is just not up to par. They have too many front of house staff on the floor at any given time. They bump into each other and create chaos.  However  they do not have enough bartenders working during prime times. Scheduling seems to need improvement. Saturday  9/30/17 at 7:15pm -- it took 25 minutes for 2 beers  2 cocktails and 3 kids drinks to be delivered. And  one of the cocktails was wrong. Another issue they have had last 3 times (in 6 weeks) that we have been there is mixing up table numbers. We receive incorrect order and another table receives ours. Both at tables in the bar as well as table in dining room. Finally - the kitchen -- the food is very hit or miss. Even their awesome Clam Chowder was a mess this past weekend. It was gelatinous and visually unattractive. Not only our table but the table across from us pushed it away after a few spoonfuls. The spicy chicken sandwhich lacked any ""kick"" at all. Kitchen has not improved at all since grand opening. Prime Rib was just OK but  not worth the price.Come on Fredericksburg  VA BJ\'s - get your act together!"
Steve S.,Parsippany  NJ,558,1171,285,9/19/2017,3.0,The last time I was down here in Fredericksburg (a few weeks ago) I stopped at BJs...the third one I've tried and I wasn't as happy with this visit as with the other two I've tried before. We were seated fairly quickly  but it took some time before a waitress came to our table...not too long  but it seemed odd. When she came over I ordered one of the BJs beers (I think it was the amber) and my daughter just had some water. The drinks came quickly and I ordered the BJs Brewhouse Burger and my daughter had the Blonde Fish & Chips. When the food finally came my medium burger was rare  like cold to the touch in the middle and my daughter's fish were super oily and a bit soggy. The waitress was a bit horrified and resubmitted the order and when they came out the second time both meals were fine. My burger was good  but my fries and my daughter's fish needed some extra seasoning. We also ordered out Pizzookies which they got perfectly. If you ever come here...save room for dessert as these are great. I know BJ's can do a little better so I will give them another shot
Randa H.,King George  VA,15,58,237,6/29/2017,4.0,We tried BJ's for the first time on Tuesday with my 5 year old nephew who has been dying to go. We called ahead to make reservations but they informed us that they do not take them  however  we told them we would be there around 6:45 and they said they'd be able to seat us immediately. When we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait  which wasn't surprising because it is new. After 40 minutes we checked to see where how many people were in front of us and were told 3 parties  but we were seated not a minute later. They brought out pizza samples while we waited which was great but one of the hostesses made a strange comment about how we should be thankful we were being seated as we were taken to the table. We had three servers assigned to our table who were very knowledgeable and friendly. They took our orders quickly and did pretty well with the tablets they were using considering they haven't been open long. Our food didn't take that long considering how busy they were and our drinks stayed full. The menu is huge and we had a little bit of everything - ziti  burgers  chicken sandwiches  salads  and the kid's spaghetti. We also shared three pizookies and a beignet. OMG. The dinners were all great and sides were very large. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. The ziti was amazing and the chicken on the sandwiches and salad was so crispy and juicy. The desserts were out of this world too. Prices were average for that sort of restaurant. We had two appetizers  6 dinners  one kid's meal  four desserts  and four alcoholic beverages for $155. We will definitely come back and try some more of the endless options on the menu.
Nicole J.,Fredericksburg  VA,50,105,306,6/23/2017,3.0,The food was ok. My fish and chips tasted like beer and I couldn't eat it but my husband liked it.The burgers were good. My daughter's friend had the chicken chopped salad minus the chicken because she's vegetarian and loved it. The hopstorm IPA was a keeper according to my husband. I had the strawberry splash which was a combination of pina colada and strawberry daiquiri. OMG. I could drink that all day.The service was GREAT.
Joseph L.,Fredericksburg  VA,15,117,215,11/12/2017,2.0,Not much to say... it was just ok. Nothing to get excited about.
Marie G.,Fredericksburg  VA,1,33,53,12/4/2017,5.0,I've eaten here several times. Sometimes there is a wait. The menu is extensive. I'm a vegetarian and my sister is a GF vegetarian. Both of us were able to select from a few different options. Everything was well prepared. The service varies  depending on the server. One server was exceptional and one of the others  not so much. Still worth the wait  with the hit or miss service. Extensive food and alcohol menu ensures everyone is happy. Sometimes parking can be filled up close to the restaurant  but there is plenty of parking  with a little bit of a walk.
Jason Y.,Pottstown  PA,0,65,13,11/8/2017,1.0,Good food and beer selection but if you get here after 10 be prepared for a nasty smell and experience from the bar. They start rinsing and cleaning the bar area  even though they're still open. Most places wait until the customers are gone. Sadly  this creates a nasty smell and releases the fruit flies. This is my 3rd time at this location and witnessed the same thing each time. Come on management! Make better decisions.
Lisa A.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,10,1,10/23/2017,2.0,"Great looking restaurant but very noisy and the food was below average at best. Portions are extremely small for what you pay. Calamari appetizer was mainly ""crumbs"" and extremely greasy. I ordered the chicken and soba noodles in a spicy peanut sauce. The noodles were grey and lukewarm. I ordered based on the photo and description from the menuand what I received was nowhere close. My son ordered a 20.00 deep dish pizza and it was absolutely not worth it. I\'ve had better deep dish from Little Cesar\'s. Best item we had all night was the monkey bread pizookie. They need to get their act together. I was expecting a far better experience than what we got."
Gail G.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,56,29,8/14/2017,3.0,This was my first time there. My server Brittany was fast and attentive. Huge menu. It's best not to have so much as it can overwhelm the kitchen but it all looked amazing. The prices are much higher than I expected however. A small bowl of soup was almost 5 bucks so I passed on that. They do let you sub sides  for example I ordered fish n chips but got the baked potato vs chips. The tarter sauce was not good. It was not traditional but more of a horse radish flavor. So I ordered ranch to dip the fish in but it was a watery sour cream look and flavor.  She said that the beer batter is darker than one may expect but wont mean that it's over cooked but it was a bit over cooked but tasty. Next time she said I can ask them to cook it lightly. I used the normal door vs the revolving as I am not a fan of those. I noticed one person here said they got hit by it.My hubby will love all of the super thin crust pizzas when I take him with me next time.It is a bit loud with music and tv's going too but it is in fact more of a bar style place after all.Only due to the high prices  I won't go often but I will come back.Another waitress accidentally dumped a whole glass if ice water on the lap of an elderly lady so that was odd but the customer took it all in stride. I just left there and ate at about 4:30pm. I will post some pics next.I do like that the owner or manager cares enough to reply to some of these so that is nice to see.
Michael B.,Jacksonville  FL,9,22,5,9/18/2017,1.0,The food portions are TINY!The $12 burger is only 5 oz uncooked. Asked for a medium cooked burger and it was just black and crisp!The food quality is very poor.Eat somewhere else!
Jessica M.,Colonial Beach  VA,74,32,8,7/11/2017,5.0,Had a good time with the family here. the kids love their burgers. the calamari was good  but my ahi tuna salad was Amazing. The flavor was spot-on. The portion of thr salaf was a little too big. The only other thing I would change would be less mixed greens  definitely less red cabbage  and more tuna with more wontons. The wontons were perfectly crunchy. The pickled cucumbers. Yummmmm. I had a bite of watermelon with it and it was even better. I definitely would come back just for that. Oh and $3 churro and ice cream to die for.  I wish i wasn't so full bc I want to eat more of it. The staff was great. And your get military discounts. I would definitely recommend this everyone.
Crystal T.,Stafford  VA,47,84,198,9/25/2017,5.0,I was hesitant to go here since I'd never heard of the place before  however  I did have a lot of friends recommending the place so you know I had to go see what the hype was all about. First  our waiter Tim was awesome and friendly! We wanted to try the garlic knots but we didn't want an entire order of them (we're trying to watch our girlish figures) so he brought us out one garlic knot each since it was taking a while for our food to come. We ordered a veggie trio small plate which had crispy roasted cauliflower  a beet medley with goat cheese  and roasted carrots; all were delicious! If you're not watching your girlish figure  I'd recommend ordering an entire order of the garlic knots; they were the bomb dot com!!! I ordered the fish and shrimp tacos for my entree since I'm vegetarian/pescatarian. I ordered one fish taco and one shrimp taco. My order came out wrong it was two fish tacos and Tim told me that they'd get the order right and to go ahead and eat the tacos that I had; I told him that I had tasted the fish and didn't like it so he brought me out two shrimp tacos; they were delicious!!! Tim also told me that if I signed up for the loyalty program that I'd get a free mini dessert so of course I did! I had the chocolate chip cookie thing with icecream on top  OMG heaven in your mouth!!!! I almost forgot  they have some pretty delicious beers too! I actually like their signature berry beer it's a must try! Definitely going back to this place.
Dave K.,Locust Grove  VA,0,8,2,11/22/2017,1.0,"We had the thin pizza that was recommended by the server  it was the worst pizza I ever had  no green peppers red peppers or onions  it had a teaspoon full of mushrooms and a half a teaspoon of sausage  some burned pepperoni and a lot of garlic and oregano.The noise level was unbearable on top of the noise they were playing  what they called music  I talked to the manager about the noise coming through the speakers .I said do you understand what they\'re singing she said ""no.""your blood pressure will double.Everything there was overpriced  we were shocked when we got our bill. We usually give a restaurant two tries but we will never go back to BJ\'s again."
Mary H.,King George  VA,86,3,4,8/26/2017,5.0,First time to BJ'S after they opened for over a month now! This place is very crowded but we got seated right away. Our server is very friendly and right on task. All the food that we ordered were extremely tasty. Calamari were perfectly cooked  breading is very light and airy. Ahi Poke was fresh and well seasoned. Kids loved the deep dish ziti  sliders  and of course the dessert! Churro pizookie is a must have!!!! Will come back next time to try out other items on the menu!
Dee E.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,19,3,11/11/2017,4.0,The only reason I'm giving this four stars is for the server Shawna G. Had some issues with the food  but she really helped out and got things to work out for me. The food was three stars but the service was five. The pizza was very good  and the beer amazing. Could see myself returning in the future  but not necessarily a regular.
Yetta L.,Fredericksburg  VA,8,14,,7/9/2017,4.0,I am completely conflicted with this review. I wish there was a multi part review. I would give the food 5 stars for taste and the service 3. QThe food is EXCELLENT. I have been here 5 times within a week. The pulled pork sandwich is one of the best I've had. The pan pizza has a nice crispy crust. The Southern Comfort chicken sandwich is amazing. We're a family of 6 and we each order something different every time we've been and there hasn't been one thing we've had we didn't like. The bad: Service the first time was absolutely horrible. Our food didn't come out for 45 min and one dish had to be sent back for being cold. 2nd and 3rd visits things were good and the 4th was The best service I've had in a long time. The fifth time  my food came out cold and the burgers were overcooked for my hubby and son. We waited 21 minutes for replacement burgers and ended up leaving. I hope they get the service right because this could potentially be one if he best places to eat in Fredericksburg.
Sarah S.,Fredericksburg  VA,33,16,2,8/20/2017,5.0,Good food and great service! Our server Ryan was amazing.He was attentive and quick.They have a huge menu  but it all makes sense. The sriracha Brussels sprouts are a must. They were so good I'm going to try to replicate them at home. The portions are huge too  so bear that in mind. I had the fish and chips and they brought four good sized pieces(see picture).They have an impressive beer list as well and the two beers that we tried were their brews and were great( the nutty brewnette and their harvest hefeweizen).
Kathy S.,Fredericksburg  VA,1,10,,7/12/2017,2.0,My date had been there for lunch so recommended it for dinner. Very busy for a Wednesday evening. Got knocked into by the revolving door because the lobby was so packed. It was very loud in there and too hot to go outside to wait so we went get a drink at the bar because of a 30 minute wait  which we don't mind. Almost fell on the way to the bar and to our table because the floors are SO SLIPPERY!! The menu is huge which tells me the kitchen is probably chaotic. We ordered the beer battered asparagus appetizer which was ok  a few pieces were inedible. My date had the jalepeno burger and fries which he liked the burger but didn't eat hardly any of the massive amount of fries. I had the lemon thyme chicken with brown rice and very limited vegetables  definitely way too much rice. It was a little dry but ok. The service was OK  I could tell our server had no table service experience.I won't go back until they clean the floors properly and have their staff well trained.Sedona still out ranks on all levels.
D C.,Fredericksburg  VA,1,30,32,7/9/2017,2.0,"It a word: ""Meh..."" Server was good  and atmosphere nice-ish (although a little on the noisy side)  but food was WAY TOO salty! 3 people in our party  and we all agreed. The appetizer came out cold  and was bland. The meals were so salty that none of us could finish them. Maybe this place is still too new? I\'ll stick with Sedona Taphouse for now..."
Kathy J.,Sayre  PA,0,2,,11/28/2017,5.0,Wonderful dinner here tonight. Absolutely the best flat bread pizza ever . The service was great from start to finish. Loved everything about it. Looking forward to coming again soon.
Adina R.,Washington  DC,0,1,,11/26/2017,1.0,We are extremely disappointed in our recent experience. We arrived to the restaurant hoping to watch our football game. There were about 4 people sitting at the bar and the restaurant was 1/4 full  if at all. We were looking forward to watching the game and getting great food. Unfortunately we were told that all of the TV's were pre-assigned with all of the games except for ours. The manager informed us he would not put the game on a single TV in the restaurant (inside or outside) because they were already selected. This was in spite of the fact there were plenty of TV's without patrons watching. This was after the games had begun. Extremely disappointed and will reconsider ever coming to this restaurant again. It's a shame. Have always had great experiences until now.
Brittanie L.,Fredericksburg  VA,21,10,1,7/30/2017,4.0,Great food and beer. Service is aLittle slow especially at the bar however itIs a new restaurant and at the moment very busy. Food comes out on the slower side but everything I have tried. Mozzarella sticks  prime dip sandwich. They even give an appetizer for the little ones while they wait forTheirFood!
Andrea B.,Stafford  VA,29,206,162,9/17/2017,1.0,"Really want to like this place but the bartender service sucks! Foods good but when you sit at a sticky dirty bar and everyone is eating and drinking and the bartender says ""I\'ll be right with you"" 3 times you walk out"
Chuck H.,Stafford  VA,1,3,,7/8/2017,2.0,While I thought I would really enjoy this place I didn't. The only thing that came out correct was the calamari and the asparagus! The salmon came out wrong  the sweet potato fries came out luke warm. Even when I asked to have the ice cream on the side for my desert it came out wrong also. They didn't offer to compensate the experience I had. The waiter said they don't do that REALLY? I'm not saying don't give this place a chance but the experience could have been a lot better! The prices are too high for that kind of service!!!Update:After speaking with the manager who is very nice I am being compensated for the experience I had. I really appreciate it.
Bill B.,Stafford  VA,3,6,1,9/17/2017,1.0,I rarely rate places but the service here is the worst I've ever seen. My first trip in this place we sat at the bar and the bar tenders  2 of them would both walk right past you to go speak to their friends and make sure they were well taken care of. Second trip sat at the bar  was there early  service was fair ( bar was near empty ) food was good  beer choices good. Figured first time was a strange fluke and tried for the third time  when the bartender informed me for the third time gee I'll be right there we got up and walked out and I assure you we'll never return. Management needs to know that their bartenders severely lack serving  service  and professional skills.
Joe D.,Fredericksburg  VA,8,7,3,9/8/2017,1.0,Having worked in the service industry for thirty years I think I am qualified to say what I am about to say.No matter how busy or how new or how slow a restaurant is there is NO EXCUSE for a guest to sit at a table for more than three minutes without someone at least acknowledging them  let alone 7  yes SEVEN  minutes. There were two of us  it was 3:57 in the afternoon  it was a Thursday. The place was dead. We were seated immediately and we started to look at the tome they call a menu. I had to use the restroom and asked my husband to order me a drink. I returned three minutes later. No server had yet greeted our table. We waited. And we waited. There were two servers standing right behind us against the back wall jabbering about something. There were four servers meandering around near the host stand. There were two other servers attending the two other tables in our vicinity. We counted five different servers walk past us. We looked at our clocks and gave a time frame for how long we were going to wait. At the seven minute mark we got up. I asked the host on my way out if the computer says what time she sat us. She couldn't remember at which table she seated us  go figure  and when I pointed it out she and another host fumbled to find out the time. Frustration took over. I said that we sat for seven minutes and no one paid us any attention and we are leaving. I barely heard an apology as I walked out. I immediately called the restaurant from the parking lot. I asked to speak to a manager. After two minutes on hold I drove out of the parking lot. At the 7  yes SEVEN again  minute mark I hung up. We wound up at Red Lobster. Always friendly. Always prompt. One of our best service experiences yet. So  go see Ally at Red Lobster. She will take good care of you. For you BJ's corporate who might be reading this- Our crappy first  and definitely last  experience at your Fredericksburg location occurred on Thursday September 8 2017 from 3:57pm to 4:05pm. Good luck.
Bertha C.,Fredericksburg  VA,3,56,135,7/1/2017,5.0,Decided to stop in today for dinner with the family. The fact that it just opened recently I expected the wait to be long. Arrived around 4:17pm with the anticipation of waiting about 30-49 minutes. Hostess said the wait would be around 25-30 minutes. Great  not to long. They took my name and had me enter my telephone number so I may receive text when my table was ready. Received my text at 4:36 pm. Good start so far. We were seated and pretty much knew what we wanted  since we have visited other locations in the pass. We all ordered the mini pizza's (build your own)  spinach and artichoke dip and a side Caesar salad. Overall everything was great  except I have had better dip. Did not have to wait long for our food and waitresses was very friendly. Signed up for the app and received a free desert. Hubby and daughter enjoyed the Cookies and Cream Pizookie. The mobile app is great  because you can get on the waitlist  order ahead and pay your bill. Glad there is somewhere new in Fredericksburg.
Albert W.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,6,,10/26/2017,4.0,Finally  a good restaurant in Fredericksburg that is not the same ole same ole. The ribs here are awesome. Definitely recommend the house brewed root beer.
Anthony L.,Southbank  Jacksonville  FL,35,19,13,9/18/2017,3.0,Really undecided on how to rate this one. Beer was good and cold. Lots of variety and an huge menu. I often sit at the bar and realize that there are other duties they bartender Must take care of.  When I have to ask multiple times for water my plate makes it to me ten minutes after the pizza we have progressed past busy and moved into bad service.  Your cutting strawberries should not tAke precedence over condiments requested.
Maria E.,Arlington  VA,126,27,44,8/26/2017,1.0,Checked in with host. Got a text saying there is no wait and that I'd get a second text when the table was ready. Received that second text 20 min later. Checked back in with host. Waited another 10 mins. Seated. Waited another 10 mins for a waiter. Immediately ordered. Waited another 30 mins for food. Orders all wrong. Ordered no cheese; got lots of cheese. Ordered blackened shrimp; got Cajun shrimp. One of the entres didn't arrive at all. Server's response : I ate it. Told him we are also missing calamari appetizer. His response  holding up a food slip: I got confused. I thought the calamari was on the burger. Told that the missing entree and the calamari appetizer would be out momentarily. Entree took 10 more min. Appetizer never arrived. Absolutely miserable experience. Especially disappointed because we've had great experiences at the Palmdale  CA restaurant.
Jennifer W.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,4,1,10/1/2017,2.0,We ordered take out food this weekend and was pretty disappointed. All of the food was ice cold(we live ten minutes away so the food didn't sit around) and the broccoli was moldy and not cooked. I attempted to call the store manager and was placed on hold for several minutes. It is safe to say  we will be spending our money else where. It's overpriced for the poor quality of food. I've eaten at the restaurant after it opened and it was great but it has already went down hill.
Pam K.,Maysville  WV,0,42,1,8/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We were so excited to try this place. We ordered the calamari and ahi tuna salad. Went and picked it up and all seemed fine until we got home and found no sauces for the calamari. Called back to the restaurant and spoke with the manager Ted. Explained the problem and told him I could be there in 4 min. He stated it would take around 10-15 to re-fire and it would be taken care of. I showed up in the proper time period. I waited in the parking lot  in one the designated pick-up spaces. I waited approx 30 min with no response. I called the restaurant and asked for Ted  well guess what  he was gone! I did get a hold of Kaylab after 2 phone calls and explained the situation. He responded quickly  and gave me a free ahi tuna. I understand they may be going through some starting off pains  but this was not a good experience. I am normally a very patient person and cut staff a lot of slack. Going to have to really think hard about going back or give a better rating in the future UPDATE: My husband and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to give it another try. Food was adequate. Service was good. Now here's the messed up part. Our bill was 186$. We paid and also got an additional charge of 166$. We we there yesterday to get it resolved. This morning the 166$ was reimbursed but we had a new charge for 201$ buyers beware! Check your credit card statements! There is either a scam going on or they have a thief!
Mike B.,Fredericksburg  VA,2,10,,8/26/2017,2.0,"Have eaten here twice (caveat: both times after 9pm). The first time the food was hit or miss across the five of us but the service was good. The second time the food across the board (six of us) was awful and the service was okay  but inattentive. As this was our second try of the restaurant  I did not complain as I believe we\'d reached the ""natural limit"". Had a manager or better yet our server asked if the food had come out well prepared  we could\'ve addressed it as part of the service process. This did not happen. One additional comment: the place is loud to the point of disrupting table conversation or ordering interactions."
Chip A.,Stafford  VA,0,1,,11/9/2017,3.0,Beer selection is Excellent. Food is good. Service is very slow. 3 visits...same for all 3.
Tommy N.,Fredericksburg  VA,8,10,,8/10/2017,4.0,The feel of the restaurant was great  I loved the design of it. The server was great and definitely knew how to give me enough info about the restaurant for my first time but not overload me with so many things. The food was good however I had the Peruvian quinoa and it was slightly salty and sour. It was overdressed in a sauce that overpowered the spinach and it only balanced well when I took a spoonful of quinoa. They have a large variety of foods so I'll definitely be back to try more!
Alex C.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,13,7,8/2/2017,3.0,The best part of our meal was the beer. The food was good  but not excellent. I got really excited when I saw fried Brussels sprouts on the menu  but they disappointed; they weren't crispy  were way over seasoned  and the sauce was heavy on the mayonnaise. Skip them. Our burgers were tasty  but I wasn't a fan of the fries (they have some kind of coating on them). Our sever was nice  but I think there was some confusion with the team service. Next time we go back for a beer I think we'll try the pizza.
Jessica N.,Abingdon  MD,5,2,,8/10/2017,5.0,All I can say is yum yum yum. The servers are friendly and very helpful. Happy to see Fredericksburg finally get something new
Wendy M.,Fredericksburg  VA,30,3,,9/2/2017,5.0,Amazing service and great burgers. The staff was so on top of it!!! Tons of choices for chow and beverages.
D T.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,8,,7/15/2017,1.0,Came here when they opened and truly enjoyed it. We came back this evening  and the professional training staff had left.Waited for the wait staff  waited for drinks  waited for food  and then literally waited over 20 minutes for the check.I hope the managers can turn this new restaurant around  it would be sad to loose it.
Sherry R.,Spotsylvania  VA,1,5,1,8/4/2017,5.0,Love this place...if you want a place where you have plenty of options then this is the place. Love  love  love  their app also.
SMib E.,King George  VA,0,41,,7/10/2017,2.0,Our first time here tonight. The food was ok. Wait staff was ok. kitchen was so slow.I thought it was just us but everybody's meal was running late. We sent back my wife's barbecue chicken because the Rice wasn't done. They were so slow replacing her meal that we got it to go and had dessert. Check came and they double charged us for her meal; the original order and for the replacement. Servers were friendly but incredibly slow. If they want to get customers in and out  they need to pick up the pace and get orders right the first time. We downloaded their app when we arrived but deleted it. Don't think we'll be back. Sedona Tap house next time.
Michael B.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,22,,8/2/2017,1.0,The only reason this place is getting 1 Star is because you have to give something before continuing. This place is by far the absolutely worst place!! Service sucks  the Manager on duty refused to do anything!! 20 minutes before even getting drinks. Don't waste your time coming here. You won't get served. Should be closed in 2 months.
Kathleen F.,Fredericksburg  VA,38,8,,7/29/2017,3.0,Eh. We enjoyed the three in house brews we tried. The menu/food reminded me of a Ruby Tuesdays or a Chilis. It was fine just nothing I'd go back for. Also  I have a hard time with any menu that is a booklet of choices. Too many options.
Cynthia R.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,14,,8/14/2017,1.0,Don't expect the manager  Molly  to follow up on anything like sending you a courtesy gift card in the mail for having a messed up order three times in a row. This place just doesn't care. It's a beautiful looking restaurant with sub par service  an unorganized kitchen and ineffective management.
Stephanie C.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,7,,7/5/2017,4.0,Second time at BJ's since the opening. The first time tried the Pizza special and the second time the burgers. The food was good both times as well as the service. The BJ's craft beers are good as well. The mobile pay option and the rewards program offer good perks and are convenient to use. My favorite thing is the salted caramel Pizookie. It's delicious  and you can get a free mini one to try if you join the rewards program.
Kevin J.,Spotsylvania  VA,38,3,,8/5/2017,5.0,Dropped in to Bjs yesterday with the family and the food was great and everything came out to perfection. Also  the staff was very friendly and our Server Julius was excellent! He knew the menu and made some great recommendations. Ask for him when you go in!
Seth S.,Camp Hill  PA,2,9,2,7/12/2017,5.0,We ate here last night. Almost no wait and great food and great service. Our deep dish pizza was so hot we had to wait a few minutes to eat it. Our Ahi salad was delicious. And half priced bottles of wine - I say yes. Did I mention deep dish cookie with ice cream?!?! Overall restaurant experience was very good for my first time. I would definitely come back.
Vincent O.,Fredericksburg  VA,39,6,,7/7/2017,4.0,Great food and atmosphere! We went on a Thursday  parking lot was full but the place is so big and there was room at the bar. The service was friendly and attentive. Our food order got messed up but the manager came by and fixed things. The food was great  especially the peanut butter smores pizookie. The also have a big menu and large beer selection. One issue  the servers bringing food to the bar never seemed to know who to deliver the food to. Anyway  will definitely go again.
Jason R.,Indian Rocks Beach  FL,1,1,,7/3/2017,5.0,They have been open for only a week  so slow service and mishaps can be expected while they work out the bugs. But the food and drinks were great!! We will definitely be going back again and again and again
Liam C.,Fredericksburg  VA,1,24,,9/3/2017,2.0,The food is good and we have been here five times since it has opened. At first we chalked the issues up that it was new and they were working things out. It has been a couple of months and I am not so sure they are going to work things out. Every time we have been here we have had to ask for silverware. The first couple of times the food came out and we still did not have silverware  we just assumed the waiter would bring it and now we just ask for it when the waiter takes our order. I have never been to a restaurant were you had to ask for silverware every time you go there. Tonight I will be honest we received the worst service so far. We would have stayed longer and ate and drank more if our waitress Shawna G had bothered to ever check on us. If we go back hopefully we can avoid her section.
Kristi C.,Jacksonville  FL,36,3,,7/17/2017,4.0,Having been to two other BJ's we were excited for this new one to open. There were a couple of things overlooked- I had a toothpick hidden in my salad -yikes - and my broccoli was basically raw on my main dish. Both of which I pointed out to the bartender  who said she'd tell the manager  but that either wasn't done or was ignored (I expected some minor form a compensation like a free beverage or similar). She did offer to recook new broccoli but wasn't sure that would be any better. Overall  however  the experience was good. They were very busy and can see the kinks getting worked out. Parmesan crusted chicken is outstanding.
Paul A.,Fredericksburg  VA,25,25,10,7/8/2017,5.0,The brew is great loved them all on the sampler something for every taste. The tavern pizzas are great we had the spicy pig. Servers were great! Join the loyalty club. We will be back actually invited family to meet us Monday.
Jeanne F.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,8,,7/2/2017,3.0,"Friday  30 June. A test. We arrived right around 4:30 and were happy to see a parking space because it was busy. Most of the customers appeared to be either outside or in the bar. I asked for a booth in a quietesh area because I enjoy talking with a friend over dinner. Our table turned out to be at the junction of the kitchen  the entrance to the restrooms  a server computer station  the corner where dining room servers picked up drinks  and the intersection of four aisles.Initially. None of this seemed to be too terribly awful  but as time passed and the confluence of all the activities ebbed and flowed  it was horrendous. The appetizer--calamari--arrived almost before the words were out of our mouths and was good. Dinner service was another matter. From ordering to receiving it took close to 30 minutes. We made no special requests. With the dining space just beginning to fill up there was no reason for such a long wait. The salmon was scrumptious  and the burger appeared to be hand formed rather than frozen which is always appreciated. The fries were limp and certainly not anything I would want more of despite the offer of ""bottomless fries."" The noise level was awful. The anticipated conversation was impossible. What I disliked most was sharing my burger with the flies. There is a big section of wall left open for access to the patio area so the flies were all over the meals. This HAS to change or the Department of Health will be closing this place down.The staff was warm and friendly  the food was mostly good  and the location convenient. I\'ll give BJ\'s a few weeks to settle in and try it again  but right now Harry\'s Alehouse is my goto brew house. And the bartenders there make a fantastic perfect SoCo Manhattan!"
Jessica S.,Locust Grove  VA,0,30,4,8/16/2017,3.0,Service is lacking although well meaning ! Still much to be learned. Will come back for second review once the restaurants been around longer! Definitely should brush up on there knowledge of their steaks. Wrong order was brought to our table although cooked to our liking it was not the right cut of meet. The waiter apologized looked at receipt and said we did order the right steak showed us receipt and went to get right steak. Well their solution ... was to take the med rare prime rib brought to our table sear it ... then hand it back to us ... Our original order a med rare ribeye . Unfortunately   the steak lost all juice and became dry from second cook. I'm also not a fan of the fries . I have enjoyed some of the foods so far loved the brisket burger ! The sauce was on point !!! The wings were great even ! The hostesses did a great job dealing with weekend rush . Overall I would come again this place deserves a chance to grow into its own :)
Daniel R.,Manassas  VA,0,7,,8/12/2017,1.0,So I've been here twice. First time was not pleasant. I sat at the bar and couldn't get a beer to save my life. Bartender was not busy and kept walking past me and my buddy. And just recently went with a group of friends and had honestly quite possibly the worst service of my life. Took 50 minutes for the server to bring us out most of our drinks. And he had forgotten mine again . Took another 10 minutes. So after an hour  all we had was our waters and a few beers. My friends left the table to go to the bar to get waters because we couldn't find our server anywhere before he arrived with 2 waters . Food took another 20 minutes and came out cold. We spoke to the manager and she was very nice and said we didn't have to pay for the food. I didn't even order food. I just wanted my tab after the first 20 minutes and couldn't get the server to do that !! The manager was super nice and handled it as best she could. So over all. The service is awful !!!! Beer and food are good ( from what I've heard )
Denise S.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,5,1,8/12/2017,1.0,I would give this place no stars but have to click one. I've waited 50 mins just to get a cup of water and it wasn't even busy. Service is horrible. Asked to speak to the manager and they never came to the table. Time is now 10:30 still waiting for food after waiting just about an hour for drinks.
Mary O.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,5,,8/2/2017,2.0,"Last night was the third time I have eaten at BJ\'s since they opened  and after what I experienced last night I was compelled to write a review. The first time I went for dinner last Tuesday  food was excellent  service was slow  but it was the dinner rush so that was understandable. Went back the follow day for lunch  it took almost two hours from the time we were seated until we paid our check  it was not busy whatsoever. With that being said  again the food was excellent  the service was horrible  only saw our server three times: order  food  check. Went again last night with someone who wanted to try it out  we decided to sit outside. WORST IDEA EVER!!! Do not sit outside  the service inside is bad enough  but the service on the patio area is atrocious. We were told to seat ourselves by the hostess  which we did  no one came to the table for 10 minutes  so I went inside and asked for a server  another 5 minutes go by  we get a server. He comes to the table and says ""are you ready to order?"" We had not been given menus or silverware or had drink orders taken  so I laughed and asked for menus. After another 10 minutes  I went and got our party menus. The server comes back without the menus we had requested and bluntly asked again if we were ready to order  we ordered our drinks  appetizer  and meals. Our appetizer came out before our drinks did (we ordered a water  and a pepsi)  I asked the server if we could have silverware (our original server did not bring the app out to the table) 5 minutes go by  no silverware  app is now cold  I again have to get up and go inside to get silverware. Our original server comes to the table and asked how the app was  and we had to ask for our drinks which had still not been served. Our drinks arrived at the same time as our meals  I got the prime rib dip with sweet potato fries. My meal looked like it had been placed on the plate by a toddler  the sandwich was soggy  ice cold  in disarray and I had a total of 7 sweet potato fries. For a $15 dollar sandwich and $2 up-charge for the sweet potato fries I was shocked. My friend got the mushroom swiss burger and was served a steaming hot burger and a mountain of french fries. I would have asked for a manager but the server never returned to our table until I asked someone else running food for our check  and at that point we were just ready to leave. Sadly I doubt I will be returning to BJ\'s. I have eaten in two other BJ\'s locations in the past and they were phenomenal  sadly the Fredericksburg location is nothing like the other two I have been to. After being open more than a month  I can\'t really see a good excuse for such poor service and I was pleased with the food until the slop I was served last night. I hope this place can get it together before it really gets a bad rap."
Ki Ki M.,District Heights  MD,0,6,1,7/30/2017,4.0,I ordered over the phone. Seems like it took forever for my food to come up even after i got there. And i had too wait a little longer be cause they didn't have everything in my orfer. Granted to place was crowded and the wait time was 50 mins (listening to the hostess).... The good was great tho.
Brian M.,King George  VA,21,4,,7/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Although the manager tried to make things right. The food in my opinion was par. I really do though like how the manager and staff tried to fix the problem.
Jennifer A.,Centreville  VA,0,1,,7/21/2017,1.0,First of all  our server Bethani had more interest in joking around and talking to people than she did on serving us. We got our appetizers and entrees before we even got waters to drink. I finally had to walk inside to the bar and ask for waters my own. My friends tacos were cold and I didn't get the right side. While Bethani did give us a discount she continued to blame everyone else instead of taking responsibility. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will 100% not be back to this location. Food is over priced and services is horrendous.
Tessa T.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,2,,7/8/2017,5.0,Had dinner here this evening and had a wonderful experience! Although they were very busy  every employee we interacted with was kind and helpful. We had mixed drinks and beer which were all great. The food and the atmosphere were also wonderful but our waiter Chris was by far the best part of our experience. He was friendly and helpful and treated us as loyal customers even though it was our first time at this establishment. We will but returning for the many reasons listed above but mostly because of how well we were treated by our waiter Chris.
Sian J.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,1,1,6/30/2017,1.0,"I was so looking forward to this being a great restaurant  but unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. I\'ve been to this chain restaurant in other states and really enjoyed my experience and was glad to see that they came to our small neck of the woods. The staff can not handle what is being thrown at them  very over whelmed by a Friday night crowd. I did everything right..name on preferred wait list  order in  and patiently waited for one hour and 20 to be seated. I was told at check in that my wait would be 20-30  understandable with the night it was  but when that came and went and I asked 45min I was told we were at the top of list  again when I went 30 after that I was also told that my party of 6 was a larger party and that we would have to wait longer to be accommodated. When we were seated  the order that I placed could not be found. They couldn\'t even use their own app (would not suggest using it  it is more of an inconvenience). I had several people tripping over themselves to fix the problem. Except for the GM Noah  who made it seem that I was incompetent and that I put the order through as a ""take out"" not ""dine in""...see Exhibit A : attached photo (clearly marked in confirmation email). He showed me bogus receipts that he used to cover his A**. The only bright spot was Aleese  who I later learned was a corporate trainer. She was wonderful  and went above and beyond to make the experience the best she could. I\'m also sorry for our server Marky Mark  who got dealt a difficult situation to handle  he also did the best he could. I understand being new  but for goodness sake it\'s a chain...you should have better customer service. You really should be up on your game. For all of that the food was just alright  defiantly not worth the wait. I know that I shouldn\'t have risked my diabetic mothers health waiting for it  but that was on me for having confidence in a sub-par establishment. If you are still interested in going wait till lunchtime on a Wednesday after the restaurant has been open for at least 6 months or just go to drink  they should be able to at least pour a cold one. But better yet  just go to one of the many local  smaller breweries...they are so much better and leave the bigger establishments to their mess."
Jason B.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,45,,8/23/2017,1.0,"another typical drunk hang out !!!  probably will not last very long as bailey\'s didn\'t !!!  typical fredericksburg ""night life"" !!!!"
Peachy K.,Fredericksburg  VA,0,5,13,7/1/2017,3.0,"Felt the food pricing was a little on the high side. This isn\'t California. The avocado egg rolls were delicious. The atmosphere/decor was inviting. However  because of the high ceiling  it was a little loud and hard to hear your table companions. The biggest issue was that ALL of the staff was training one other person  each. There were WAY too many staff in there. So we constantly felt like we were being hovered over  not as in  ""Can I get you something "" but just because the mass quantities of staff were everywhere  all the time. Training in shifts would have been better than having every single server in that place  also have a trainee tailing them. It also seemed like the servers were assigned tables all over the place instead of each having a traditional section where their tables were all near each other. As a former server  that was weird to me and seemed inefficient. Our drinks  a sparkling water and plain water were brought 5 minutes apart. Also weird  considering that the plain water was the one that was delayed. We didnt really try too much food as the avocado egg roll appetizer filled us up pretty well. We ended up just sharing a boneless buffalo wings. Both items were well done. I look forward to trying a pizza or maybe  the parmesan crusted chicken next time. But  please  for the love of God  cut down on how many staff you have training all at once. It was like a zoo in there. Way too much going on with that  to relax and really enjoy your meal. All in all  BJ\'s is still working out the kinks  a week after opening  but they show strong promise!"
