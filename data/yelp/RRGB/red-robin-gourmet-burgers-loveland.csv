Melissa L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2015,"I will never return to this restaurant ever again. We sat down and had our drink orders taken. When the waitress came to give us our drinks she spilled the entire tray on me, the drinks for our table and another. The manager never once came over and the only thing to be offered was a free dessert. When our food came out the order was incorrect and the waitress was super rude and argumentative about it. I mean how can a business have such horrible service? If I could give a negative star rating I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
J E H.,"Monument, CO",0,44,1,2.0,10/19/2013,"Stopped here with three hungry kids on the way home from a swim meet. Decent food, but service was fairly lame and irritatingly slow.  Server seemed unable to manage multiple tables... food sat on the line for quite a while and my requested fries never arrived.  Overall, food tasted fine - burgers were good- but the overall experience was overshadowed by mediocre performance by the  waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Tiffany K.,"Windsor, CO",86,77,34,3.0,5/5/2011,"Okay, so maybe it's not fair to judge a restaurant based on a busy Friday night, but I did.  After cooking at home all week, we needed a night out and thought Red Robin was the place to take the whole family.  There was a half hour wait, which wasn't bad, but we were told 15-20 minutes.  Waiting crowds clearly didn't have enough space to wait as well, because we had to elbow our way through to get to the desk when they called our name.  People tried to move out of our way, but there was no where for them to move.  Lots of sassy teenagers hang out here too, which is not pleasant, but understandable.   The noise level was horrible.  I mean, it was so loud that they were singing happy birthday to people two tables away and I still have no idea what the staff was singing.  Nor do I think the people at the table could hear it well either.  Is it the acoustics?  Or that they don't manage the seating well?  It seemed we were all packed in there pretty tight.  The staff was very nice though.   We got simple burgers and beer.  The burgers are always great here, no matter which one you order.  Due to the rowdy atmosphere, we decided to get out of there as soon as we were finished.  My son was angry, because he wanted to split a sundae for dessert.  I was honestly disappointed, because a relaxing evening where I didn't have to cook was the goal.  We were not relaxed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Karissa W.,"Loveland, CO",0,2,,4.0,3/10/2014,Great customer service! Food was so yummy! I ordered a Teriyaki Chicken burger and it was Delish! Great Family Resturant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Ashley H.,"Windsor, CO",84,202,43,5.0,12/15/2013,"Quick & easy. Royal Red Robin Burgers are so delicious. Their latest burger ""Smoke & Pepper Burger"" is the best I've had! Cooked a perfect medium.

Homer S.,"Boulder, CO",5,68,1,5.0,11/13/2011,"You know, a successful restaurant grows to 2 locations, then gets some financing, and moves into an adjacent town. Next thing you know, they're a regional presence, and some noob says, ""I don't go to chains."" Shut the front door. Now. Red Robin is a chain, and makes money, because they know what they're doing, and jillions of customers keep coming back. Great, attentive service, good burgers (and lots of other great choices), unlimited fries, reasonable prices, clean stores. I never think of Red Robin first (my kids do), but I'm always glad I went. Thanks Loveland Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20

Tom S.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,4,,3.0,1/2/2015,"Some things in life are just worth waiting for. That's why you should not go to Red Robin at anything approaching a busy time. Even when they're not busy, the service sadly can only be described as lackluster. Sometimes the food at this location is really good, but sometimes it has been greasy and sloppily assembled. Just generally not worth a wait, but OK if is not busy and you're drinking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Keith H.,"Fruita, CO",11,48,8,3.0,7/8/2012,Food was okay for red Robin. Nothing special. However the service was terrible because it took him anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes just to get drinks and our order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Shane Z.,"Willard, UT",56,340,48,4.0,4/30/2013,It was a cold lonely night when I stopped in here. The snow had blanketed the ground and I think it had most people scared to venture out.  I ordered a normal burger and had them substitute grilled chicken instead.  There was only 1 other table being used so service and food was fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Tim L.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",106,1112,125,3.0,11/28/2008,This chain is pretty standard across the board. This particular location is a reasonable size with friendly staff. The major draw here is the reasonable pricing with big juicy burgers and generous portioned meals in general.  The bottomless steak fries and that damned addicting Red Robin spices is what keeps people coming back. A meal for two is easily had here for $25.  They're super fast here with dishing out the orders and so it also makes a great place for a pre-movie dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20

Michelle D.,"Loveland, CO",0,8,,4.0,4/9/2013,"I was sad to see the old logo and decor go, but they are did a great job of revamping the food.  Best burger I've had in awhile!

Oh Y.,"Washington, DC",15,92,34,5.0,1/9/2010,"Large portions, quality food (not the bacon bits Cobb salad like TGIFs), and a flexible menu with an even flexibi-ler waiter :)  He must do yoga, I almost asked him, because the finesse with which he handled our pain-in-the-rear party of 9's requests to mix and match the menu would have sent a monk over the edge.  Family  --  you can't live with them and you can live without them.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20
Kristin S.,"Castle Rock, CO",98,169,22,4.0,7/4/2009,"Picked up to go food here for the family on the way to the lake. Ordered 3 burgers and a kid's corndog. Oh, plus the shakes. We are on the vaca, so what the heck? So Red Robin has a burger called the bonzai, in which the patty is marinated in teriyaki sauce. There is grilled pineapple, cheddar, mayo, tomato, and lettuce. Well, I am pretty much addicited to this burger (as I have been for the last 10 years or so). But the thing about a bonzai is they are either ""just ok"" or ""frickin amazing""! I don't know how a burger can vary that much in taste, but it can. Well, my to go bonzai from the Loveland Red Robin is seriously the best bonzai I have ever had. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to trust me on this. The fries were just ok for all of our burgers. The shakes were delicious!

Angela S.,"Longmont, CO",0,9,,2.0,7/9/2012,The past two times we've been here both the service and the food have been average to blah.  We've decided to look for other options in this area or drive to another Red Robin location if we're really craving the bottomless fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20

Anita F.,"Loveland, CO",2,6,4,3.0,11/3/2017,The manager was shoddy.  Showed him our dirty silverware.  He said he would go check dishwasher.  Essentially blew us off.  We wanted nothing free or any compensation.  Check was already paid.  Just didn't want other customers to have same experience.  Someone could get sick.  Red Robin didn't care.  Manager didn't care.  Please beware!  They need a health inspection badly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland

Jaclyn B.,"Cheyenne, WY",173,331,802,5.0,4/18/2016,"I have always had great service here.

Marie E.,"Loveland, CO",7,42,,4.0,8/9/2017,Both my husband and I had the Banzai Burger. Delicious! I just wish the patties were a little bigger. It seems like they've decreased the size of the burgers over the years. I was very impressed with our server. She was so friendly when I talked to her about how neat the strawberry lemonade glasses were (the ones that are curved and have red stripes swirling around it). She told us that those glasses are for sale on  . I had no idea! She kept our drinks topped off and made us feel welcome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland
Erica S.,"Loveland, CO",2,38,,1.0,6/13/2017,"This used to be or go to restaurant when we have the kids for the summer or someone was visiting. After our visit last night, we probably won't be back.

Jodi L.,"Loveland, CO",15,27,6,3.0,11/26/2016,"Not horrible, but not the best. Food was fine, but all of the silverware was dirty, like it had not been washed.  Coffee was terrible, but I guess they are known for burgers and fries, not coffee.  The waitress was a shirt of grumpy/salty from the moment she finally got to our table. Bad day maybe.  Still sitting around waiting on a water refill nearly 30 min now.  If you like mediocre service and chain food, then this is your place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland
Amanda Z.,"Atlanta, GA",51,115,431,5.0,5/22/2016,"This was our first visit to Red Robin, as we are visiting from Atlanta and there are only a couple of restaurants there. Haylie took care of us and was awesome. She took the time to explain things after learning we were unfamiliar with the restaurant and was very pleasant. The manager stopped by and was also very sweet. The food was VERY good! I ordered the Bonzai burger, and it was incredible. The menu is filled with more ""traditional"" options as well as unique ones. It surprised me how quickly appetizers, the burgers, refills, etc came out. Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland
Laura B.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,61,2,3.0,10/28/2016,"The Ridiculous (?)

Ethon E.,"Loveland, CO",1,3,,5.0,6/8/2015,"Good atmosphere, great service, and awesome food. What more could you ask for? The freckled lemonade and onion ring appetizer is SO good!

Tina S.,"Loveland, CO",0,46,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Our family will no longer be going to Red Robin. The hamburgers are half the size now for $10.00. To get the normal size they used to serve all the time (1/2 pound) you have to pay $5.00 extra ($14.99). Ouch! I can buy 4 lbs of ground beef for that price. The buns were stale and they put a small tiny amount of fries on the plate. It is 'all you can eat fries,' but making the customer ask for more fries the minute they set the plate down is demeaning. It is so evident that they are hoping the customer will not order more. Truly, there are other places with much better hamburgers for a much better price. This is sad because I have gone to Red Robin since the 1990's, in many states, and I remember those delicious big hamburgers and huge amount of fries, and that is why we kept going back. Inflating their prices and shrinking their portions will only put them out of business. And this is not just happening in Loveland, CO. My sister in Indiana said they quit going for the exact same reason. They were really bothered by the small portions too. Red Robin, you are making a big mistake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland
From C.,"Windsor, CO",0,72,,3.0,7/10/2016,I love Red Robin Burgers but I think sometimes your hit and miss with great dining service when you go to a franchised restaurant.

Allen R.,"Loveland, CO",1,6,,3.0,8/28/2015,My family and I used to enjoy coming here.  Now they have this ziosk thing that you use to order most of your stuff.  It really disconnects the server from you.  There is no personal touch to service anymore.  I don't feel compelled to tip the customary 15% anymore either.  If I'm doing more of the work and the server is doing less why should I still give a tip for my service to myself?  This is just a bad idea from the get go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland

Logan M.,"Denver, CO",21,203,1,4.0,3/6/2013,"I know I'm not supposed to like this place because it's a horrible chain but I've never really had a bad experience at Red Robin (by design, of course).  My last visit was set up for failure: we called ahead with a party of 15, and still ended up waiting half an hour for a table.  The front of house was completely understaffed and the restaurant was slammed, but we got friendly, personal service and it really made for a great experience. The back of house is of course designed to crack out mediocre food and they came through in spades - my ""medium rare"" burger was on the done side of well, and it's a good thing the fries are bottomless, I didn't even need both hands to count the fries I got.  Luckily, our waitress had a great sense of humor and put in work.  Also, their buffalo wings have a really unique parmesan taste - they were probably the best thing I had all night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland
