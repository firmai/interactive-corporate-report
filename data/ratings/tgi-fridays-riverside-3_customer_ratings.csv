It took forever to get our appetizers to the table and then when the actual dinner plates came out......there was a fu**ing bug crawling on my sister in laws lettuce.

We pretty much ordered only appetizers as our meals.  They came at different times and mine came 20 minutes after everyone else had their food.   They were very nice when my brother realized he ordered the wrong thing.  They said it might take about 15 min to get him another dish.  He said okay.  It was closer to 30.   When my meal finally came out, it was the wrong thing.  I would have complained prior to eating it however the waitress was never around, and I didn't want to wait 20 min to get the right thing.  I did tell her when she came around.   She didn't offer to take it off the tab and when we asked her to she told us it was the kitchens fault.   I don't think we will return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=120,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.212,2.52

So I walked back to my table they were gone so I asked an employee nearby if they probably tossed it or just put them in the back. At this time the guy who cleaned my table walked back and she asked him about them. He said he just placed them in the back so he went to grab them for me. Well later on when I opened the box I was disgusted to find a piece of shrimp and a shrimp shell in there with my food. When me and my boyfriend didn't even have shrimp we had the Jack Daniels Chicken. Thats fucking gross, if he threw my leftovers away thats all he had to say. I should have suspected something cause it took him like 3 minutes to come out with the box but you don't ever expect someone to do that.

Today I took my order to go, but had to go back to ask for Jack Daniel's sauce for- you guessed it- a jack burger. Shouldn't it have it already? The staff seemed annoyed by me having to ask for it, so I took my one container of sauce and left, even though I had ordered multiple burgers which should have warranted multiple sauces. On top of this feeling of having to beg for what should have been offered or already in the bag, my order was promised in 20 min but I got there in 30 min and it still wasn't ready.

Only came here for happy hour, so I guess this is more of a happy hour review. 5 PARKING: OMFG. So much parking around Tyler, but only at night.  4 SERVICE: I got the same waiter twice and he was the best! The waitress on the one hand was still nice, but didn't really provide my roommate and I with efficient drink recommendations. Busy around happy hr (1st round), but I love the 10pm-close happy hour. 3 DRINKS: Summer specials were weird. $5 savory and spicy was interesting. Had the cucumber drink and it was more tolerable than the tequila with sea salt drink. I hope they never have that menu. However, their normal happy hour drinks are so delicious. $5 Ultimate margarita, electric lemonade, and long island and $3 beer. Ordered: Ultimate margarita: Ah, get the mango raspberry mix? So good! The lemon? one is normal. Recommend. Tasted electric lemonade: It's blue, but I don't really like this one. Some of my friends like this one. Tasted long island: Tastes better than the electric lemonade. Gummi bear: Mine was stronger than my friends, but it was a delicious mix! Don't know the price though. Beer is pretty good, but normal. 3 FOOD: All appetizers are 1/2 off and they have some other appetizers for cheap. Ordered: Recommend all three. 1. Full Plate of nachos: Pretty good for the price. Comes with guacamole, beef, sour cream, jalapenoes, etc. the norm. 2. Sliders (x3): So delicious, I want to order these every time I come. 3. Mozzarella sticks: Fried cheese is so good!

135,Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,2.0,2013-06-24,"Was always wondering why this place had such a lousy 2.5-star rating until I dined there recently.  Except for the wonderful and enthusiastic service by Bethany, the rest of the meal was pretty forgettable: 1.  Honey BBQ boneless chicken wings were very yummy and definitely the highlight of the meal. 2. Potato skins unremarkable with NO consistency as to cheese and bacon topping ratios.  Some had plenty of each and some had almost none.  Looked like the chef just tossed handfuls at random. 3. Chicken Flatbread was soggy and horrible and was sent back.  The chef and manager here should go to Chilis, which has a FAB California chicken and avocado flatbread. Other issues: WHY does TGIF continue to lack full transparency in the pricing of almost ALL drinks on its menu other than wines?  This is a disturbing growing trend among chain restaurants to HIDE the fact that those $1.50 soft drinks, milk, coffee, lemonade, juice etc. are now $2.50 to $2.99.....a monumental rip-off.  Even worse are the drinks you THINK are perhaps $5 and then you get your check and they are 60% higher.... AND.....when the  male host comes by your table and says:  ""How's everything going BOSS?"".....I just want to cringe.  We are NOT on a plantation and I am NOT your boss!! This SAME thing happened at the TGIF at Dos Lagos not long ago.....   Why has it become soooo commonplace at almost ALL low and mid-priced restaurants these days to address the customers as ""Boss"", ""Bro"", ""Buddy"" and ""Dude""?......Nothing is acceptable except for ""SIR"".  Why does management allow this to continue?? Seven of the last 8 dining experiences at different restaurants had male servers addressing me by the SAME slang terms.....Just a pathetic way to address any customer....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=140,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.3760000000000003,2.44

I can't go without ordering green bean fries they are just so good! Service is fine it isn't top notch but it's always pretty busy so I give the servers the benefit of the doubt. The food is amazing I have never had a problem with the food being stale or tasting weird.  If you have never been here and are reading my review, here are my recommendations: Appetizers: Green bean fries, BBQ Chicken Flatbread, Loaded potato skins, Jack Daniels sampler, and the pot stickers. I don't recommend the wings as they have no flavor they are just hot and taste like vinegar. Entrees: Anything they have with ""Jack Daniels"" in the name (Seriously), the ribs are good but are not meaty at all, Fridays shrimp (one of my favorites), Dragonfire Chicken, the New York Chedday and bacon burger, and the JD Bruger. Dessert: Whatever tickles your fancy, I like it all. I don't recommending getting anything to go, I did that once, got home and it was all really soggy.

143,Wendy B.,"Corona, CA",1658,2025,7089.0,4.0,2013-07-15,"After a decade of boycotting and having a mostly justifiable paranoia about chain restaurants, I had to give TGIF a chance. The main reason...we had a large group of family coming down to visit a loved one in the Kaiser hospital nearby.  With all our eclectic tastes, we needed a place that could offer variation, would serve later than 9 pm, could manage our bunch of demanding foodies, and was close to the hospital. TGIF filled that bill.  The menu was page after page of interesting and well thought out dishes.  Damn! That made choosing hard. Mind you, nothing really fancy, just down home food that sooths the savage soul.  The 3 item appetizer combo was semi-decent.  It came with a platter of flatbread that had plenty of cheese, tomato, basil that I found to be delicious.  Also, the buffalo wings were equally wonderful.  The only let down was the mozzarella sticks with marinara that were mostly missing the mozzarella. It came out to be more of a hollow bread pocket. On the bright side, they would have made excellent edible finger puppets. While I really did not check out everyone else's level of satisfaction on this visit, the steakhouse burger was fat, juicy and nicely med rare.  Mr. B was stunned at how delicious it was.  My Bruchetta Chicken Pasta was also quite good, herbal, tomatoey, cheesy with a balsamic drizzle finish. And my only problem was quickly solved when they took back the diminutive chicken breast that I felt was overcooked, no questions asked, and brought me another that was tender, moist, bigger, and had a good grilled flavor. But as another reviewer (Will H) has surmised about the origin of the poultry, I believe he was spot on. Neither of the breasts were very hot, so could not have been freshly cooked from a raw state. I believe Costco also sells those in bulk in a freezer bag, grill marks and all. Not bad, but not original. My favorite touch? The Parmesan fries that came with the burger. Fat steak fries drizzled with a garlic butter and cheese.  Oh my goodness, should I tell you?  I am so picky. And they turned me on. They should be outlawed for breaking the rules of common decency they were so sinful. The fruity, strawberry smoothy Mr. B ordered was not overly sweet, and appeared to be a blend of fresh fruit ingredients and mix. Nice and thick and icy, it met with our approval on an especially hot summer night.   I liked their seasonings, many of their entrees were alluring, their portions generous.  Good enough that we returned two nights later for a repeat performance.  Yet another successful meal.  I think their ""2 For $20"" is quite a deal.  You share an appetizer, then each choose an entree from a select list. While Mr. B and I could not agree on the choices those two nights, that deal is still on our radar. A great meal at a price that is hard to beat. Our server was attentive, even though our food came out a tad slow, but not terribly bad. So, I gotta tell you. All things considered, we will be happy to return. Better than your average 3 star, not quite a 4 star, but on its way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=100,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.576,2.52

Well first I think the chips had been thrown in the oven to re-bake, and warm up. Both the chips and the salsa are BLAND.

108,Patrick M.,"Riverside, CA",319,151,186.0,3.0,2014-05-31,"I don't like giving bad reviews. Unless you are like Miguel's Jr. where there is no way you can change unless you throw away your recipe and start fresh with ""real"" guacamole, I tend to waiver on the high side when it comes to my ratings. If it is service I will usually come back and see if the service is the same. We all have bad days, and customers can be jerks, so I won't write a bad review about service unless it is something real crazy.  Yesterday, the service was fine, but the food was just ok. Not even A-OK. Just ok. Besides mix match socks with holes, I really dislike food that doesn't look like the pictures on the menu. Main reason why me and Subway don't get along. Though we do squash our beef long enough for me to get a meatball sub. But other then that, if Subway is thristy walking down the street and I have a glass of water, I would pour it out before I give it to subway... fix your stuff Subway!!!!.  Anyway, Friday, or T.G.I. Friday. (Do anyway even call them that?) Really failed when it came to the food. And I was bummed because the picture was so darn awesome looking. I ordered the Blue Cheese Stacked Burger, and the picture looked so darn good. I swear I could have ate the menu. Matter of fact, all of the stacked burgers looked extremely tasty on the menu. So I ordered that. My date ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese.  I ordered my usual drink if they have it (Guinness). It was flat... kind of old tasting, but I am actually used to that. One day I will go to Ireland to get it fresh but right now, I will take it how I get it.  My burger came out and I thought I got the wrong order. It was small. It didn't look like a stacked burger at all. Actually was no bigger than a Quarter Pounder at McDonalds. And I was handed about 8 fries... maybe 9. The fact that I could visually count the fries once they were handed to me was clearly a problem. If the burger came as advertise I wouldn't have noticed, but it looked sort of sad. I tasted it, and it was ok. Carl Jr's new burgers with home baked bread tasted better and that is no bueno!! (I had to order the basket of fries afterwards because I was still hungry... that is unusual for me at Friday's) My date said her Sizzling Chicken and Cheese was ok. And that was pretty much the theme. We both felt it was just ok. I have had burgers from Friday/T.G.I. Friday before and it has been better. I was going to take a picture and send it to my friends but once the burger came out I was no way going to send that sad excuse of a stacked burger to anyone. The only thing that prevented me from 2 starring them was the Goose Island IPA I received. Strong and fresh. And that is lame. A beer you don't even make killed it. Because Friday/T.G.I.Friday is a chain, I won't say I will never go back. I am really tempted to go to another location to see if the Stacked burger is better.

I gave one star because i have been here when service and everything was great and overall the food was ok..but come on TGI's get it together..and stop laggin with the customers. now while i appreciate this is one of the only places open around 11:30 on a sunday night....i feel that customer service should always be a priority...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=160,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.5000000000000004,2.52

We had a guest coming from another country, a representative from Warner Bros and took him to have a drink over there, well, the staff was awful, security guy approached us at entrance and ask for an ID which is normal, but when our guest showed him his international license and passport he took his documents to the back of rest to talk to a supervisor, then he came back and said he  could have any drink. We asked to speak for a supervisor, think I never do and I wouldn't give less that two stars, they don't deserve any!  The supervisor came to our table with no name tag, no properly dressed as a ""supervisor"" and didn't even introduce her self she was worst than the security, we explained our guest just arrived from another country and of course does NOT live in here, she just said no to everything being rude, at the end after explaining all over again, she said he could stay if he will bring a US passport and that's the ""company"" policy. So.... Tourists can't come to this place to have a drink? Even if they show all their documents that proof they are older than 18 and they are here legally just visiting friends?

Despite the ""it's always Friday"" mantra they push in their commercials, the atmosphere was dead and they were playing emo music. We were tortured with Taking Back Sunday-type whiny music the whole time we ate. Not very Friday. The worst part was the food. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my cousin had the club. Our food took forever to come out. When it finally arrived, my fries were wrapped in a little packet of brown paper and my cousin's weren't. Also, mine were cold, tough and chewy so I'm guessing mine were portioned out from an old batch and then thrown under a heat lamp or something. Hers were hot and fresh and not in a packet.  The sandwiches were a total disappointment. Both came on a ciabatta roll, which is entirely too much dry, hard bread to eat. My pathetic sandwich was literally just the chicken, two end pieces of a mealy tomato and approximately five slivers of shredded lettuce. It was roughly 1/4 meat and 3/4 dry bread. No spread or anything. Even after slathering on the accompanying blue cheese dressing (which had no blue cheese or flavor), the bread was still tough to get down.

On July 3rd we visited the restaurant. We weren't seated immediately so we went to the bar area. About 15-20 went by and we were called to our table. We already knew what we wanted to order. I had my ""FREE"" entrée to jumpstart your July 4th weekend.  I specifically asked the waiter what qualified as an entree and he answered ""everything""; great, we ordered steak and lobster. We waited sometime before the food came but it finally arrived. Our steaks were ordered to be cooked medium well but they were tough as leather. I sent the steak back and once again it's taking forever ( we had tickets to see Magic Mike, didn't want to be late ). It was taking so long the manager sent the waiter (Demetrius was covering for our regular waiter) over to offer us a dessert courtesy of him. Finally, the steak came and was quite tasty. We are ready to leave and OMG it's taking FOREVER!!!!!! The waiter brings our check (the original waiter). I review it but it doesn't seem right. I question the waiter and tell him we had a coupon, the cake was complimentary and the steak replaced the first steak. He left and came back and said what we ordered did not qualify , he said it's his fault and told his manager that. He re-created the receipt, which reduced the bill to half. Though our experience was very disappointing I left an 18% gratuity. Today, July 5, I checked my bank account and he charged me the original amount. WHAT!!!

It's almost like the servers here are really lazy because our sever was barely around and when we did see him he looked like he was just strolling around.  My husband wanted to leave a small tip because of the service but I still left 15% because I feel bad leaving less than that.  Now for the food - The side house salads with ranch are pretty good. The breadstick that comes with the salad is delicious!  My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's steak and ribs with a side of mashed potatoes and Mac N Cheese. The ribs were terrible and the steak was just okay. However, the Jack Daniel's sauce is delicious! The mashed potatoes are fairly bland but the Mac N Cheese is SOOO good! I could eat the Mac N Cheese by itself.  This is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars.  For dessert I ordered the Oreo Madness and it was a complete mess! The ice cream was all melted and the presentation was horrible! I've had it before at other Friday's and it never looked like this.

First bad sign of the night was the manager? (Middle age white guy with beard and sorta longer hair) stopping us and asked in a non-welcoming tone if we were there for the bar or restroom and said we needed to show ID. Normally I assume showing ID would be shown after being greeted or seated, which we had received neither. So we wait about 30 minutes until a pair of bar top stools opened up. We sat down and ordered water, and immediately Kelsey? Gave a smirk and comment to the other bartenders in reference to us not ordering alcohol off the bat. After that we received no attention for 10 minutes or so even though we were ready to order our meals and possibly a drink. We were annoyed and my coworker found a manager on duty, Nestor, and he sat us at a regular table after we explained our situation. Heather was a great waitress, but we were a bit annoyed that given our professionalism with Nestor, he didn't seem genuine at all with our experience nor did he ever come back during our meal to ask how everything was going.

Walked in on a Saturday happy hour night, all chairs taken, no tables. None of the workers for TGIF bothered to approach my party of 4, instead they ignored the fact that we had to stand versus having us take a seat elsewhere and move us into bar as the area opened up. But to their benefit, their security guard was smart enough to make this type of decision and committed to his job, explained to us we can sit in the porch area, enjoy our happy our specials and he would personally walk us back to the bar as soon as something else opened. Yes sit outside as you would anyhow yet you are able to order drink :)! Hello TGIF! Your security guard is making every minute count, TGIF personnel should do the same! Props to the security guard because if it wasn't for him we would have left. Who wants to stand around without a drink? No one! Workers keep in mind, every person you sit is money! All reviewers here complain about wait times yet the security guard has given you not only a solution a profitable one too! It did not take any more than 10 minutes before the security came back for us with an open table in the bar area. By then we had already ordered a full round plus an appetizer...  If anyone comes by here I suggest you check in with security guard, have him sit you outside, take a beer, A drink whatever it is to get your night going, and before you know it your back inside.  We left at last call, as we walked out once again the security guard was helping the workers pick up umbrellas outside, gather chairs. He is not part of TGIF yet he's profiting every minute that goes by for them! It's only fair to give credit to the one person making this place happen, that is security guard Jae..

118,Corey G.,"Riverside, CA",0,26,,1.0,2016-03-29,"This is specific to this TGIF and not the chain as a whole.  Horrible food and service. 2 visits ago, we were told the wait would be 30 minutes for a table of 5. We ended waiting 1:15. I understand the wait times not being an exact science, but that was way too far off from the estimated wait time. To make matters worse, when we got our table for 5, it was actually a table for 4 with an extra chair added. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. The service was slow. The food was pretty much what you expected except my kids spaghetti was cold and had to send it back. It's bad when you can't get a child's spaghetti right.  I wrote a complaint to their website and got a call back from corp. They apologized for the experience and offered a $25 gift card. That was much appreciated as it showed they valued their customers and their feedback. We headed back a few weeks later with our gift card. My wife ordered a breaded chicken salad. The chicken was so tough and overdone that she couldn't cut if with a knife. I called the waitress over to complain and she said sorry and that she would let her manager know. I don't know if she never told the manager or if the manager didn't care, but the next exchange we had was when she handed us the check. I tried to pay using the $25 gift card (it was actually emailed to me and the instructions were to show this email). When I showed her the email on my phone, she took my phone to look at it and then walked away with my phone without saying anything. I wasn't comfortable with her taking my phone so I followed her towards the kitchen to retrieve my phone. The manager took the $25 off my bill but never offered any apology or asked how anything was. I actually regret not complaining more about the chicken, I shouldn't have paid for that.  I'm not a big fan of TGIF in general but its ok and I usually know what to expect.

I wasn't there to drink nor did i bring an ID (i didn't think id need it) and my fiancé wasn't either even tho he had his ID. We've been there together and separate multiple times and even when we've sat at the bar it's never been an issue..at ANY fridays location. Sooo. I have no clue.

61,Paulina R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,3.0,1.0,2016-07-10,"I am so disgustingly upset it's not even funny. In the past 7 years that we have been coming here we have NEVER had such ghastly service.  We decided to meet up with a couple of friends for date night (normally do TGFI or Applebee's), we decided on here because it was closer to home plus we've always enjoyed it today however, it was most likely the last time we'll be coming here.  We met up here at 6:00 PM we put our name down they had said about 25-30 mins. so far so good, my friend and I went to the ladies room while the guys waited for a table, we just so happened to come out and find and empty table at the bar so we took it.  As soon as we arrived Anthony our server made sure our table was clean and got us started with our drinks. At the time we ordered drinks we also ordered some appetizers because c'mon happy hour all day on Sunday is a must. We got our fries and cool we're catching up etc. Anthony came by to see if we were ready for food and so we ordered.  It's now about 7:06 PM and food started coming out but one of our friend is still waiting for the mozzarella sticks he initially ordered when we got there. We had no silverware, plates, or napkins, and we only had 2 menus for the 4 of us. (1 hour for an appetizer, like really?)  At this point we're pretty upset because some food came out first then the other we're playing the waiting game so we can all eat together but by then our burgers got cold and bread got mushy but whatever we called our server on the tablets provided light went off FOREVER and no one ever came, he eventually walked by and we asked for the manager. Trudy came out (did not look like the manager, she does not look one bit professional) and asked what was wrong, we explained how the service had been horrifying all night and how we were still waiting on an appetizer that was ordered over an hour ago, how drinks hadn't been offered for another round, and etc. She went off to show us to look around and tried to blame a big party for the lack of attention on our table. She said she'd take the appetizer off our bill and talk to the server, we explained how no one had came when we called for service so she put the light on herself and left. Okay.. So here we are sitting again like idiots waiting for our checks it's about 7:36 PM and we saw Anthony walked by and asked him to please get Trudy again because we're frankly quiet confused as to what's going on, we lost our appetites and by now we all just want to leave. Our date night was just ruined. She comes back and asked what's wrong(this time she seemed bothered), we said well we're waiting for our checks and to see what you're gonna do about this terrible experience. We let her know that this by far has been the worst experience I the past 7 years we've been coming here, she went off to say she had never seen us in ALL the years she's been there, irrelevant and so what? Am I lying now? Do I need to go back in my feeds and bank account to prove myself.. I don't think so. It's the truth. She said she had already called corporate and the general manager and that she had already talked to Anthony, my husband told her he'd call back to follow up but we did let her know we most likely wouldn't be back and that we didn't refuse to pay but it was unacceptable that she was making us pay for all our bill and not even apologize. As ridiculously as it may seem an apology would've been greatly appreciated.   My husband explained to her that he works at a restaurant and understands but there's things that are simply unacceptable. He let her know we were aware they couldn't do anything about the drinks but could definitely work out something with our food considering we didn't even really eat from how upset we all were. She went and took of the burgers and came back had me sign the receipt and disappeared.  We simply just left, like I said at least an apology would've been nice. For 7 years all 4 of us have been coming here and we have never had such a horrific experience with the service and management, it is frankly a shame. There goes 4 loyal customers.

This place hasn't been bad before me and my buddies have been here a few times and always get great service from Yesenia by the bar area. It does get a bit busy at the bar so food tends to take a little longer but your drink is rarely empty which is a good thing because time flies by.  BUT THIS TIME we decided to sit outside to change the scenery. We got there about 10:15 pm and there's only one party of 4 people sitting outside so it was great. We get there Alyssa approaches us and takes our drink orders which we all order water because it was hot. Then about 10:30 we put a food order which we are think in about 20 minutes food should come great. At 10:45 a big group of people come and start to disturb the people around us so they decided to leave, once they left they started to get louder and annoying. At about 10:50 an other waitress comes out and asked us if everything we ok i told her no because our food wasn't there yet. She said let me check on it comes back with an appetizer 20 minutes into waitng. About 5 minutes go by and Alyssa comes back and tells us that she isn't going to be our waitress anymore and that Omar is going to take over because they are moving her to be the main waitress for the big annoying party we said that was fine and food should come out quickly.  So we sat there waiting at about 11:15 I had enough of waiting so when our waiter come out I told him to check on the food but by this time I was really upset. Comes back at 11:25 and says they are still waiting on the chicken we order. So I told him cancel the order we are leaving. His response was let me get a manager I told him no because there was no point if they were going to mistreat customers that were waiting there.  They don't care about hard working people who  just got done working out and just want a good meal, rather cater to the loud drunk crowd who probably don't even know the definition of gratuity.

Let me start by saying I typically enjoy going to Fridays especially for happy hour to grab some drinks but today was not our usual enjoyable time. Very disappointed by the service my girlfriend and I experienced today. When we were given our menu's my girlfriend and I flipped to the very back page for the 4,7 menu and when our waitress arrived to take our order we ordered from that menu. I ordered the Cobb grilled chicken salad and my girlfriend had the chicken bruchetta pasta. Our meal was tasty and we also had the ultimate Margarita and ultimate long Island which were good. Then things just went down hill, we placed a second order of drinks which took about 20 minutes and we had 3 other employees ask us if we needed drinks but we assured them our waitress was handling it after the wait for our drinks we were ready to leave and when the bill came our waitress charged us for the regular priced dishes when we ordered from the 7 and up menu. I mentioned it to our waitress and she told us that we were wrong and those items weren't on the 7 and up menu. Clearly they are!! When I told her they are on the menu she said it was our fault for not telling her which menu we were ordering from. I ended up paying the full amount when I should have just asked for a manager instead. After all that we just asked for a to go box which took another 15 min for 1 box...ridiculous.

I got fully off of trying eveything which I didn't really enjoy most. Other than that, if I had only ordered the wings itself, then definitely worth the price because they are endless!

The server did not bother to pre-buss our table and it took about 15 mins to get our drinks. We ordered 3 20 ounce bud lights on happy hour. When we got our bill we had 5 bud lights on our bill. I asked her if she could please take off the other two because they weren't ours. The server Yessenia went on to tell us they were ours and they were rang in every 15mins. We were there for almost two hours. If they were rang in every 15mins we should of had a lot more. She went on to say they were ours but if we want to talk to a manager that we could. So the managers name was Matt and he basically accused us of lying and said they were rang in every 15mins. But said he would take it off this once as if he was doing us a favor when it wasn't our drinks. As he walked away he said well my name is Matt if u wanna make a complaint with a smirk on his face. We were 150% know those 2 extra 20 oz bud lights werent ours. As a food server myself for almost 10 years. I am appalled by the way I was treated and the service me and my family received.

We let her know that this by far has been the worst experience I the past 7 years we've been coming here, she went off to say she had never seen us in ALL the years she's been there, irrelevant and so what? Am I lying now? Do I need to go back in my feeds and bank account to prove myself.. I don't think so. It's the truth. She said she had already called corporate and the general manager and that she had already talked to Anthony, my husband told her he'd call back to follow up but we did let her know we most likely wouldn't be back and that we didn't refuse to pay but it was unacceptable that she was making us pay for all our bill and not even apologize. As ridiculously as it may seem an apology would've been greatly appreciated.   My husband explained to her that he works at a restaurant and understands but there's things that are simply unacceptable. He let her know we were aware they couldn't do anything about the drinks but could definitely work out something with our food considering we didn't even really eat from how upset we all were. She went and took of the burgers and came back had me sign the receipt and disappeared.  We simply just left, like I said at least an apology would've been nice. For 7 years all 4 of us have been coming here and we have never had such a horrific experience with the service and management, it is frankly a shame. There goes 4 loyal customers. Years of anniversaries and birthdays.. I'm still in shock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=40,2.0,2.69,2.69,2.7880000000000003,2.414

However the food was slow coming out but understandable. We did all order endless app. So, I heard it was a different station when it's prepped and cooked. But it was good. Server was really nice and try to attend to us as quickly as she can with how busy she was. So, will go back again if I feel for the endless again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3,2.68,2.8,2.8,,2.7520000000000002
38,Ben P.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-09-25,Love the deals and food but they state online they have the NFL package.  Then I showed up and they don't offer it.  This is my only knock.  You would do much better if you had the ticket.  That's why I'm at BWW instead.  If you offered it you would have a packed house rather than 2 people at the bar.  Pretty simple business decision.  Oh and watch out for their tip calculator......it is way off!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=20,2.6,2.8,2.8,,2.72

Sunday is all day happy hour. Yippie!  [Our Order] Traditional wings with Jack Daniels sauce on the side: wings are so delicious with the JD sauce combination  Basket of fries: one u taste one u can't help but finish the whole dang basket. 5 bottles of beer.  Our order altogether came out to $27. I am loving these happy hour deals. We plan on coming in again to catch other games during football season. [Customer Service] Even though it was a little loud and busy our bartender did a great job taking our orders and bringing our orders out quickly. Also, reminding us about the happy hour deals. Oh!

He was friendly, out-going & very attentive. The bartenders are even awesome. Particularly a female bartender named Amanda.  I was watching the bartenders hustle & they kept their customers happy by constantly making sure they had what they needed.  The food was delicious & prepared correctly. I would definitely go back & if you want to make sure you get great service too then ask for one of these servers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3,2.6,2.87,2.87,,2.7620000000000005
4,Tim R.,"Corona, CA",33,65,144.0,1.0,2017-11-29,"In the past I have enjoyed my experiences at other TGI Fridays. I usually order the endless apps and have rarely been disappointed.  I went to the Tyler Tgi Fridays on Monday 11/27 at 748pm and my server was Anthony. My server never checked to see if the food was good and fresh when it arrived. He didn't bring us water till the second course. He was not attentive.  Now for the food, which was subpar and not up to the standards of the TGI at Dos Lagos.  The 5 buffalo wings arrived cold and the potato skins were not loaded but had a spinkle of cheese and bacon. On the second round I ordered the Jack Daniels wings and Fried Mozz. The wings tasted like a bad chinese cracker, in that they were over cooked or in the warming lamps too long. The wings were overly chewy and tasted bad.  My girlfriend  avoided the wings after trying mine. Her loaded potato skins, pot stickers, and Fried Mozz came out fine.  It is absolutely unacceptable to serve cold wings. Let alone old wings. If I'm paying 15$ each for unlimited apps then I expect quality. My server never asked how the food was and was unavailable most of the night. Suffice it to say that I wont come back for the endless apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3,2.6,2.86,2.86,,2.7560000000000002

I've been to this Friday's before but never had issues like I did this time. Drinks are always good and service was decent hence the 2 stars but other then that this is at least the 2nd or 3rd times (tried to give them a chance to get a better review) I've come to this particular location and this will be the last time.

0,Dan N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",290,168,204.0,3.0,2018-01-12,"Came here because I was gifted a 25$ gift card, so decided to try it out. Ehhh nothing really stood out about this place thus the three star rating, I truly believe it is a pure average restaurant.  The server wasn't the best but she wasn't terrible, the food was okay but not great, and the prices were fair. I got the lobster tail with broccoli and rice and share a bit of a burger. The lobster seasoning was too bland and the broccoli was a little overcooked. The burger was decent but nothing really stood out about it, just a regular burger. The fries weren't too fresh either.  Overall, just an average restaurant to go to if you really feel in the mood for American divey bar type food. I am impressed however that they have new technology in the bar area where you can call your server or pay on a tablet, probably to better the service, which I thought was pretty neat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3,3.04,2.87,2.87,,2.9380000000000006
