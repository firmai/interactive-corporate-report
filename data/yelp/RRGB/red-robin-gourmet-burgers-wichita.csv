Melina A.,"Wichita, KS",1,38,26,4.0,8/1/2017,My husband and I came here for the first time today and were very impressed. The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean and had a nice modern look.  The food tasted awesome and had great flavor!  We both got burgers which only came out to $26 + a tip  with water as drinks (Amazing price for eating dinner out!). He got a black and blue burger and loved it and I got a regular cheeseburger and loved it as well. They also have bottomless fries which is a plus.  They have a lighted outdoor seating area for those that like an outdoor option.  Its a great place for all ages to enjoy a nice lunch or dinner out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Tram N.,"Bedford, TX",39,187,651,3.0,12/30/2017,Came here with my family for lunch.  Service was great and our food came out in a timely manner. At this location they bring out basket of fries to your table for you to snack on while you wait.  I ordered the wedge burger (basically a burger patty between two wedge salad). I asked for my patty to come out with some pink but mines was well done. Minus the meat being over cooked my burger was nice and light.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Angie H.,"Wichita, KS",21,101,89,4.0,11/5/2017,"I love this place!  Aside from the ""eat yourself silly"" bottomless steak fries, we've always had great service here including free fries with ranch and campfire sauce to tide you over until your food arrives. I love their burgers but I always get a chicken burger now.  The chicken breasts are always big and juicy.  It's a staple lunch place for us when we have to venture out East for a Costco trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Rachel B.,"Newton, KS",45,83,71,1.0,10/3/2017,"This red Robin has either gone seriously downhill, or it was having a terrible night when we went. My burger which I asked to have no pink whatsoever (I have a queasy issue with bloody meat) came way undercooked, really rare, and I took a bite before realizing. I became so I'll I ended up leaving without eating at all. My other half's burger was not good, undersea stoned and chintzy on toppings and our server was not only unhelpful, but rude and when we complained to the manager, not only didn't he really help, but he must have been vague with the server because the server came over and said, I'm sorry if I offended you. (I'm sorry if I offended you? What the.....?) Anyway, we used to love going there, but it's looking like we won't be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Rebecca T.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/2/2017,Brooklyn was our server and she was amazing!! She constantly made sure our drinks were full and we had plenty of fries. The food came out super quick as well. Best waitress we've had!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita

Manny M.,"Wichita, KS",52,42,92,3.0,6/1/2017,"I am pretty simple, burgers and pizza and I love them both.  But recently when I have been coming to Red Robin I have not been overly fascinated.  Yea they have some good options for burgers but the service has not been up to par.  If you don't want fries with your burger you do have the option to choose other sides so your not FILLED UP on BOTTOMLESS fries before your meal.  You can also pay an up charge for their sweet potato fries.  My recent favorite burger here is the mac n cheese burger.  A good restaurant will make some good mac n cheese, as a side option but Red Robin did one even better by putting it on the burger... yum.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Bobby P.,"Wichita, KS",5,70,6,4.0,6/10/2017,"Red Robin.... yummmmm.one of my favorite burger joints in the ICT. If you want to go when they are not packed, good luck.

Shelley C.,"Benton, KS",51,422,1572,5.0,3/21/2016,"We were seated all the way in the back between 2 kid parties. It was interesting. The waitress was new. She was being monitored by another guy for performance, so I told him she did well, which is true. She gave us a basket of fries to get started with ranch, then we asked for bacon, campfire and Buffalo sauce.  I had the Baja burger with fries in a bucket with no bottom. Ha! Ha! Enjoyed the pineapple ring! Hubby had some super burger with his fries in a basket. We enjoyed pretending we were with the birthday people both times they came to sing. Everything was juicy and delicious. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Lena T.,"Wichita, KS",186,32,9,3.0,6/9/2017,Staff is hit or miss.  Food is just ok.  Not much to make this place memorable.  Guessing the steak fries are their staple however they don't just serve them you must ask and they do not come readily so the wait puts you off a bit.  I would drive to TJ's in Delano if you are hankering for a great burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Megan B.,"Bozeman, MT",0,2,,1.0,10/29/2017,"We will not be going back to Red Robin anytime soon. We decided to try it because they have gluten free buns and it is kid friendly. We got there and only one other family was waiting to be seated. No one greeted me. I asked if there was a wait for a table of four. The girl said ""no"" and then just stood there. I wasn't sure what to do. She didn't ask for my name or tell me to hang on a moment or anything. Then I saw her grab some menus and start walking. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to follow her because she still hadn't said anything. I was thinking maybe she was seating the other people who were there before me first. After she realized I wasn't following her she came back and said she could seat us. We got to the booth where we were supposed to sit and it was covered in food and dirty dishes so she said ""I need to clean this so just wait right here"". It was really busy and we were in everyone's way. Eventually we got seated and started asking questions about the menu. Either I wasn't being clear or she wasn't understanding me because she couldn't answer any of my questions.  We asked her to give us a minute to get our order together. She didn't come back for at least 10-15 minutes. Which, when you have kids, every minute counts. We all ordered something different and she said the sides that we ordered were all ""bottomless"". She brought out cold, mushy fries fairly quickly. My kids weren't even impressed. The food didn't take too long. But I can see why. It wasn't good at all.  They gave my son a bun with his burger when I ordered one without (allergy), then they put onion on my burger and I asked for it without and then they forgot my sons side of apples, and then they didn't give us any silverware or napkins. None of us wanted to eat much of our meal. It just wasn't good food. But we did eat the some of the sides (broccoli, apples etc) and never once did our waitress offer to refill our ""bottomless"" sides. We actually barely saw her. Finally towards the end of our meal a younger guy comes over and asks if he can refill our waters and then as he's walking away said ""oh, if you need anything I guess I'm taking care of you now. At least that's what my boss said"". I wasn't sure what to think. I was just glad our meal was almost done. A few minutes after that, our original waitress came over and said ""you must be confused right? Well, I'm not feeling well so I was going to go home but I'm going to stay until you guys are all done."". To which I replied, if you're not feeling well you should just go home. And she said, no, she will finish the job she started.  Alright, I will give her credit for wanting to hang in there, but she shouldn't be working in the food industry while feeling sick! Unfortunately I have a compromised immune system and it's a serious deal if I get certain illnesses. So when someone who is handling your food says that they're sick but will tough it out, I would rather not!! The whole experience was not good. Here's to hoping my family and I don't catch whatever out waitress was sick with.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Jane D.,"Wichita, KS",0,24,,3.0,5/25/2017,"I love the burgers here but have really grown weary of the wait staff and their ""I'm too good for this job"" attitude. Tonight was the worst. Ryan could barely be bothered to speak to us to take our orders. Not engaged to say the least. A manager didn't bother coming by either. If you can stand mediocre service, you'll likely enjoy this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita

Everyone is so cheerful and their positive attitudes just make the dining experience even better! Their burgers are excellent. Always juicy and never too greasy. One time, I ordered a salad because I was on a diet (which only lasted one day). I regretted it so much when I saw my friend eating her burger! However, my salad did not taste half bad and I actually enjoyed it! I don't care much for the unlimited fries to be honest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Kitty M.,"Wichita, KS",0,8,1,4.0,5/30/2017,"Wanted to give 5 stars BUT.. daughter ordered a FRECKLED fruit salad w/ her mini corn dogs, and apparently the freckle in this case was a live TICK. She got very frightened. It was small in size, but moving. I did not want to make a scene and upset her or the baby so we waved down the server (if i made a big deal i know she would not have eaten at all) Ticks are very dangerous as they are dosease causing. I had a 10month old baby with us I was going to give some of the fruit. And my daughter being 9 didn't need a tick either. Luckily she saw it. They were very kind about it, gave her just apples. The server checked them all. Another guy possibly a manager came over to apologize and said he passed it along. He was very kind. About it.. So the kids meal didnt cost anything. Not sure if comped or kids eat free tuesday i never know what resteraunts do that. So if they comped it for that, it was nice of them. Anyways nice place. I am sure they tossed the fruit out.. hopefully. But the royal burger w egg was great, mini corn dogs goood.. bf had some spicy burger he loved. Our server was very nice. It is a great place, it is just so so important to not send out bugs.. and if you do a dangerous bug is the worst.. it was right on top in clear view so they should have noticed. I am worried for other children that may have eaten them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita
Jacob C.,"Reno, NV",0,2,1,5.0,9/10/2017,I would like to start by thanking the manager for assisting with both my wife and my son for two separate food allergies. Although the meal was slightly delayed; the willingness to ensure both soy free and dairy free meals means the world too me. The extra care and customer service prevented a potential trip to the hospital for my son and is greatly appreciated. As a family we go out to eat every two weeks and will certainly be adding this Red Robin to our destination list.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita

Megan P.,"League City, TX",463,279,2233,5.0,1/3/2015,"First off let me say that our hostess looked like she needed come pep in her step. As a frequent diner of all different types of places I know the importance of the first impression. The first person you interact with at an establishment it really should be a happy one.  Once we were seated though we were served very quickly during extremely busy hours. Joey our waiter was stop on. Never missing a step drink were timed perfectly, he was attentive but did not hover. The perfect waiter in my opinion! I was very impressed. I ordered the Bonzi Burger with a garden burger and it was great. My only complaint was the soggy bun. By the time it got to my table it was already mush. The flavor was still there but that smash bread feeling is a little off putting. Mister had The chophouse burger which he also throughly enjoyed.

Jennie I.,"Wichita, KS",9,40,35,3.0,5/22/2015,"Came here with a friend because we were going to go get pedicures nearby, and I knew that they offer a few different veggie burgers on the menu.  Instantly we were greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. My friend and both looked at the drink menu, and we both decided to get a ""coco-rita"", which is essentially if a pina colada and a margarita had a baby. it was so delicious! I decided on a boca burger, over the gardenburger that they also offer and got it mushroom swiss style! The burger itself was good but the whole mushroom swiss aspect was lacking, it was pretty flavorless, the mushrooms could have used some seasoning. Also my sesame seed bun was soggy and felt apart.  My favorite part was the fries! They are thicker cut and I would describe them as steak fries seasoned to perfection. Although, the portion was very small and they were never refilled. I thought the fries here were bottomless? Oh well! I'll stick to the Anchor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=20

The""Tower of Onion Rings"" arrived 3 minutes after we placed out order.  Their gourmet burgers were what attracted us here and they lived up to our expectations. Our waitress is friendly and efficient and kept us advised of the stays of our burgers.  The only negative aspect would be the noise but that's not Red Robins fault.

Red Robin's french fries are too good (if you know what I mean). Really the only negative thing I would say about it is the noise factor.

Karen M.,"Wichita, KS",22,180,167,4.0,3/5/2015,"Hubby and I went here on Monday. We kept seeing those 'Gourmet Burger' commercials and since my Husband had never been -- we decided to go here for lunch. We got there when they opened at 11:00 am. We ordered their 'Tower of Onion Rings' as an appetizer. my Husband got a Margarita 'on the rocks' and I got an T.N.T. (which is a long Island Iced Tea basically). Our Server, Bryce, brought a basket of fries when we first arrived and they were hot and delicious with 2 different dipping sauces. Then he brought our drinks along with the waters that I requested. My Husband made a funny face when he first sipped his Margarita. He said it tasted funny -- not like a typical Margarita. The Onion Rings were huge and delicious and they too came with 2 different dipping sauces. Hubby ordered the 'Prime Chophouse' burger and I ordered the 'Whiskey River BBQ' I asked to substitute the fries for a salad -- since we had already had fries and onion rings. It's becoming increasingly rare to find 1000 Island in restaurants, so I was pleased that they had it. The burgers were delicious and huge. We only ate about half and packed the rest up in 'To Go' boxes for dinner. Our lunch was a little pricey -- with Tip it was $55 dollars -- but we had gotten appetizers and drinks But even had we gotten sodas and no appetizer it would have been about $35.

Right we overheard tables saying just say its your birthday they were lying so they would get a song from waitresses and a balloon  and a free dessert? Not sure they were not asking for i.d., it became a joke, daughters burger was burnt and wifes  cluck and shrimp were soggy from sitting to long under heatlamp, just dont see the hype for bad service bad foid and horrible atmosphere, and other yelpers are correct too many employees that dont sleak fluent english or know menu",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40

However, I think it's ridiculous that they don't have physical gluten free menus and you have to go online to see it. Not everyone has a smartphone and employees have to get theirs out to show the customers. Also, there was no wifi so it required data usage to look at.

Scott T.,"Olathe, KS",26,63,13,1.0,5/17/2009,"2 thumbs down.  We have stayed away because of poor service and high prices at this location in the past.  Today was no surprise. We gave it a shot today because we had a gift card.  When we arrived, we ordered 2 beers.  The waiter left and brought us back water and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer of queso.  At $8 I asked the size, we were told it was really good sized.  It arrived quickly and were amazed of the size.  It was a fairly small bowl of queso with about 18 chips.  Not much for 3 people.  I have posted a photo of it on this review. Meanwhile, no beer.  We asked our waiter where it was, and the response in broken english was they were changing the keg.  We finished our $8 chips and still no beer.  So we put down the gift card and left. Red Robin is over-hyped.  It is nothing more than an overpriced burger joint with poor service and mediocre food. In this bad economy, the Red Robin corporation really needs to review their business model. My advice... Stay away from this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Brian M.,"Wichita, KS",1,37,3,4.0,12/14/2009,"Well, my wife and I have been frequenting RR since it opened and keep coming back! Sure there are kids/families in the place but we always sit in the bar area and even wait if we have to in order to sit in the bar. Courteous families with small kids park in the main dining room.  One thing they definetly need to upgrade are the TV's. They are old and outdated.  You can't beat the bottomless fries. Eat 'til your heart's content. It has a full bar. Good bloody marys, cold bottled beer served in frosty mugs. Draft beer also avail. The burgers come w/some pink or well. They will ask you when you order if you want some pink. I always do and it is never raw in the middle. My wife orders her well and it comes back consistly well & juicy not a ""hockey puck"". The service overall has been good. Alot of young servers with limited serving experience, but they have a positive and cheerful attitude! Give it a try, it's habit forming!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
T H.,"Wichita, KS",60,105,158,4.0,1/31/2012,Big fan because the kids love it here.  I love the tower of onion rings.  yum!  i think the balloon man (a very talented one i may add) come on Sundays.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
jason m.,"Bentonville, AR",3,39,,2.0,4/22/2013,Overpriced. Not a fan. Burger had a chemical taste. Dessert was huge but most of it got left on the plate. Blah.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Gina R.,"Live Oak, TX",79,122,33,4.0,9/16/2011,"I love the Guacamole burger, super yummy! How could you not love the bottomless refills and steak fries. Great family restaurant. Try the fish and chips!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Ann M.,"Wichita, KS",7,8,7,2.0,8/15/2010,"Red Robin falls short of extraordinary. I have been there about 5 times in the past 3 years and the food consistently lacks that punch of flavor you yearn for from a burger joint. Despite bottomless drink refills and fries, the pricing runs on the high end. Expect to fork out atleast $50 for appetizers, drinks and entrees for 3 adults. Most of the staff are young and inexperienced. In my recent visit there, I felt rushed by the waiter, he also wasn't very friendly, and did not apologize after having us wait for 15 minutes for him to come take our drink order. 2 stars for decor and ambience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Nikolas M.,"Valley Center, KS",0,9,,4.0,8/30/2008,"One of the better 'american' themed restaurants I've been to. The atmosphere, while really, really loud, was great and energetic. We were seated fast and got our appetizer really fast also. The waitress was really nice and brought us our food extremely quickly, making a very good impression as most food places take ages to deliver. I had fried zucchini and a BBQ Chicken Wrap on a Spinage Tortilla with some steak fries. The fried zucchini was a pleasant surprise, tasting much better than I thought it would, and while reminding me of the 'snack wraps' of most fast food places, the Chicken Wrap was delicious and much better than anything similar I've had. The steak fries have nothing to do with steak, which is good, but they were also delicious. The only main problem we had here was the waitress dropped out credit card while walking to her cash register and it got kicked under something. No one saw this, so we were quite scared, as was the waitress, when we couldn't find the card. After ten minutes of most of the restaurant staff searching, we finally found it and left happy. On a side note: unless you're good with embarrassment, don't go here on your birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40

julie h.,"Wichita, KS",0,18,,5.0,4/21/2011,"Excellent burger!!! Great quality and tasted yummy!! Good service, slighty noisy atmosphere (busy lunchtime), lots of kids/families there. Will return!

JD B.,"Wichita, KS",11,20,2,3.0,10/30/2009,"Next to Carl's season, Red Robin's fries seasoning is one of my favorites.  Don't know too many restaurants who have their own seasoning that they allow liberal application to their all you can eat fries.  I'm fan at this point.  Love the atmosphere for a quick lunch or taking the entire family with balloons for the kids.  Power lunch to get business done?  Hardly.  But, I was reminded why they do burgers so well when my burger was presented to me and it looked just like one in the pictures.  I know, I sound pretty basic here, but when you see photos of a big mac and you get a smashed down version, it's nice to see food prepared that looks like how its advertised.  Always look forward to a visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Tom S.,"Arlington, VA",1,7,5,3.0,1/7/2007,"A cut above the other multi unit multi market operators specializing in burgers and American food.  The portions were generous and we didn't need to take them up on their all-you-can eat fries deal.  Burgers are the main show here,with a great variety and some unusual ones to choose from.  As a side note- waiter did not know the difference between fresh and pickled jalapenos, which detracted from my dining experience.   This location was  packed with families, even though it was nine thirty on a weekday.   The ones on the west coast seem to be a little more pub-like, with fewer families and more twenty somethings enjoying the spirits and mixers offered by the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Rachel N.,"Eastborough, KS",8,17,7,2.0,4/30/2009,"It was SUCH a disappointment going to Red Robin. I was bombarded by this mascot handing out balloons, kids that just would NOT keep quiet, and bland food. I may as well have just eaten greasy cardboard... The burgers had NO taste!!! I had to get a magnifying glass to see all my fries! How did ANYONE enjoy being there????!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=40
Quinn H.,"Wichita, KS",52,65,,3.0,9/10/2008,"Do you like droves of screaming children? Oodles of colorful balloons? A mascot that will give you nightmares? Then Red Robin is your place. The burgers are a bit overpriced, but tasty nonetheless.

Carl J.,"Wichita, KS",1,41,,4.0,3/14/2006,"If you like burgers cooked to order, Red Robin is great!  You can get your burger the way you like 'em.  The food is excellent.  The drink selection here is not as good as the Red Robins of the Seattle and Vancouver, BC area, but the drinks they have here are good.  You can usually just walk in and be seated quickly.  If you order an appetizer, you should space your main order out or ask the waiter/waitress to hold the order for a few minutes or so to finish your appetizer.  The service is quick enough for a lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wichita?start=60
