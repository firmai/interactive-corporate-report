32,Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",423,586,1161.0,3.0,2013-04-30,"When people say they really like BJ's Chicago deep-dish pizzas, what they actually mean is they really like (overly starchy and doughy) bread, with some toppings for the sake of color. What they have at BJ's isn't pizza. It's a way to carbo-load prior to a marathon. The Moroccan Spiced Salmon (or something) was not entirely terrible. Well, that makes me sound snooty; it was actually pretty good. The roasted red pepper sauce was kind of watery, and not spicy enough for my tastes (remedied by liberal amounts of red pepper flakes), but there were bites where I was reminded of my mother's cooking (she's not Moroccan, but some of the spices used in Moroccan food is similar). The pickled cucumbers on top were quite yum, and there was the occasional crunch of toasted almonds, which was surprisingly pleasant. But it was something like $13.00-14.00. Not at all worth that price point.  Personal pizza + Moroccan Spiced Salmon (+ a drink maybe?) = $32.00+ Worth it? Sort of? Maybe? Not really. I probably won't be back for a very long time, but if/when I do, I'd definitely get the Salmon again. If you're a big fan of of overpriced and sub-par pizza, small portions, or shopping at the Outlet Shoppes nearby, you'll probably love BJ's pizza. Okay, that time I meant to sound snooty.  Get a Pizookie®. If you're going to get fat, you may as well enjoy yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=20,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
48,Eric F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,48,2.0,3.0,2013-05-09,"We've had BJ's before in Norman, OK.  Still get some immature laughs every time we discuss the place, what can I say? Wife and I went with our 20mo old daughter for my birthday.  The entry is kinda cool with it's big revolving door.  The prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay for the amount and quality of food, but not absurd by any means.  The Calamari was delicious, and felt like a nice size for an appetizer, though I am personally not a fan of the chewy tentacles.  For those wondering: yes the calamari at BJ's includes little creepy tentacles as well as the body meat I love so much. House salad was pretty generic.  What can you really expect though?  It's just a salad.  Wife and kid seemed pleased enough with it. We split a 9"" (small) deep dish ""Great White"" pizza.  (basically chicken alfredo pizza)  The chicken was amazing, though I kinda wish there had been more on it.  In fact all the toppings were delicious.  The crust had a hint of crispy-cheese flavor around the edge which I liked, and it was light enough that I didn't feel bloated after eating 2-3 pieces.  I can see why the other reviewer seemed less than keen on it, as it wasn't perfect by any means.   Since it was my birthday they brought out a mini pazzoki (sp?) which is really just a delicious and hot cookie in a tin with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was incredible, and I could feel it going straight to my love handles.  To be honest, I feel like the last time I went to the BJ in Norman it was a birthday as well, and I could have sworn the pazzoki was much bigger, but who can really complain about free birthday chow? Sadly being new the place still has a few kinks to work out, especially with the small book they call a menu full of beers and food.  I had asked our waitress about ""flavored teas"" because I love a sweet fruity iced tea, and she only knew about the icky raspberry tea from the fountain (I can't stand the stuff, doesn't taste anything like tea to me). I noticed later that they have ""mocktails"" which are fruity drinks without booze in them, including a Peach tea, and a Blackberry tea.  Both made with Monin syrup mixed into tea.  I've had these before and love them, but having already resorted to ""just water,"" the $3 price tag for said teas seemed unnecessary. Fun place with decent enough food.  Seemed ideal for parties of 2-4, with the potential to push some tables together for larger parties.  Also they had advertisements saying ""call ahead and skip the wait"" or something like that, so it appears you can make tentative reservations if you like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

The Very Berry Margarita is my favorite. I'm really glad they come out with the small appetizer plates because I kill the Feta and Watermelon Salad and the Chicken Wontons.

Tonight was my second time, and the experience was not any better.  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad, which comes with romaine lettuce, blackened chicken, red onions, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crispy tortilla strips, and Santa Fe dressing. I asked for the red onions to be left out. I suppose to the chef, that meant leave almost everything out because all I got was the lettuce, cheese, a few tortilla strips, and the dressing. No red bell peppers. No tomatoes. No avocado. No corn. And most importantly, no chicken. When the waiter came round again, I explained that almost everything that the salad was supposed to have was not in my salad. His response? ""Oh."" Instead of asking for a new one, I simply asked for what I wanted most - the chicken and the avocado brought out to me so I could add it into the salad. It came out within a few minutes by someone else entirely. I added it in and the salad tasted decent after that, even though it was still missing a few items. There was never an apology offered, not even an offer to discount the price of the salad at all for basically just giving me a plate of lettuce. Did they really think I was going to be ok with being charged about $13 for lettuce and that I wouldn't notice they left out quite a bit of what was supposed to be included? Stuck around for dessert which was the baked beignet. The flavor itself was good with the strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and cinnamon sugar.

35,Brandon R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",29,39,8.0,2.0,2015-07-04,"I have tried this location several times now, I intentionally waited to write a review. I kept making excuses for them as to why the service is so horrible. However, I've run out of excuses and have come to the conclusion it's nothing more than just bad service.  Let me start by saying the menu is great. Everything I have ever ordered tastes wonderful. The signature pizzas are obviously great. The steaks are good. Nothing to write home about but not disappointing either. The calamari appetizer is a must order and for dessert the pizzookie (spelling?) is amazing. We have never been disappointed with the food. Now to the service... This is consistently the worst service I've had and I'm including fast food! They are extremely slow with beer orders which is crazy considering the fact that they claim to be a brew house. I can only imagine how much money they have lost from not being faster. We finish a beer and order another and it can be 10-15 min before the next round arrives. The wait staff is very friendly and it may not be their fault maybe the bar staff is where the problem lies. We had my birthday dinner there recently and there we approximately 16 people in our group. Several people had not been before and they told me even though the food was good they wouldn't be back. After the meal we were sitting waiting for the aforementioned pizzookie we had ordered. After 20 min it became apparent our server had forgotten about them. I don't know how else you could explain it taking longer to make a pizza and deliver to my door than it took them to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie and walk it across the room to our table. Our party was there for approximately 2 1/2 hours and we were only served 3 beers in that time.

1,Jess M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,78,96.0,2.0,2017-11-15,"Have you ever watched 'Kitchen Nightmares'? If you haven't, it's a show where Michelin Star Chef Gordon Ramsay goes to struggling restaurants to see what they're doing wrong and tries to fix them. A lot of times he'll see that the kitchen is disgusting or the food is rancid and expired. BJ's, I'm sure, doesn't have any of those problems, but Chef Ramsay would have an issue with the size of the menu. After looking at their menu online, I counted ~150 items. I understand wanting to have something for everyone, but 150 seems bonkers. It's a bit overwhelming to have to thumb through 25 pages of food that all seem like they would taste fine. Luckily, I didn't have to think very hard about what to eat. On Mondays, BJ's offers their large Deep Dish Pizzas at half price, so my brothers and I chose that.  We decided to do half Chicken Bacon Ranch and half Gourmet Five Meat. The Chicken Bacon Ranch was easily the better of the two that we chose, but still nothing amazing. The Gourmet Five Meat, while meaty, was pretty dry. We asked for extra sauce, but it was still pretty parched. Also, BJ's Deep Dish Pizza is nothing close to actual Deep Dish Pizza. Deep dish is supposed to be more like a pizza lasagna/casserole. BJ's pizza more closely resembles Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza. In fact, it pretty much has the same topping and crust ratio (2/3 of the pizza is just crust) and tastes almost identical. If we had shown up on any other day and bought the pizza for full price, I would be disgruntled. Since it was half off, I'm slightly gruntled.  Despite all of the bad things I have to say about their pizza, their Pizookies are delicious! Sure, they may be over 1000 calories each, but who cares? If you have the room for it, go for it!

(My niece had her usual nachos, and THAT made her as happy as a little pig in shit.) I've heard some less than pleasant anecdotes about this restaurant; it's true. (Chain restaurants can, after all, be spotty depending upon location, franchisee, management in general, et cetera.) And, to be candid, I can't imagine coming here often. (I'd rather support locally owned places. Period.) That said, I had a very, very nice little meal here, and so I can't complain. One thing -- and this IS important: Someone needs to send a memo out to all the employees here that being on your cell phone during work hours is simply NOT acceptable. Period. I saw about a third of the staff here fiddling with their phones in lieu of working. THAT, my friend, is simply not acceptable. (Were I the manager here, I'd ban all cell phones, iPads, and other personal electronic devices during work hours. No exceptions.) OK, grumpy old man rant over here now. I'm hungry for a Jalapeño Burger and hard cider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
