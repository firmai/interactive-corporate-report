Dwight C.,"Hemet, CA",140,233,76,5.0,12/18/2017,A nice surprise on a busy crazy night! We stopped at this restaurant for dinner after a Christmas boat parade in Newport Harbor. While we had made reservations the neighborhood was crowded with Folks coming and going to the various parade concessions.  We were seated immediately even though the restaurant appeared packed. This facility is part of the BJ's chain and has a varied menu with many choices. Service was fast and our server present and helpful. Food arrived quickly and was hot and tasty. We were not rushed and our server checked on us a number of times even though he was very busy with a number of tables.  A very pleasant dining experience after a nice evening on the water. Prices were very fair and a bit lower than we had expected to pay in this high tourist area. Restaurant appeared to be an older building and a bit worn from heavy usage but was clean.  This is a recommended stop for lunch or dinner when in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach
Florence S.,"Hesperia, CA",434,386,725,4.0,11/20/2017,"This was a tiny bjs but it was still bjs and I enjoyed it. I was surprised to see how many tables they had for the space, but they made it work and they have a loft area. The loft was full of teenage girls so we avoided that area and of course when I went to use the restroom they were all inside.  The missing star is for the bathroom situation. I wanted to wash my hands before we ate and I couldn't get close to the bathroom. The hallway was full of teenagers and the bathroom a tiny single stall. It was clean but you could see the age. They need an update for sure.  The menu is missing some of my favorites because the restaurant is tiny. We were able to order other things and that didn't really matter. I wish they have the pepperoni pizza appetizer my kids love. We ordered a flatbread pizza instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach
Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4325,743,1968,4.0,7/7/2017,"After a day of fishing on the pier with a PACK (thanks Patrick) of Cub scouts, our family and another wanted to grab a quick late lunch around 3 pm, and head for home.  Considering parking in Balboa is always a giant pain in the asada, we left the truck in the pier lot and walked to this BJs. We were quickly seated in a booth with a few extra chairs, and given various kids and grown-up menus.  Our server was a young man who proved to be very patient and attentive, even with our kids who missed naps and are generally indecisive anyway. The restaurant is... cramped.  It's a small place anyway, sort of snuck into an existing older building that shares a roof with a touristy ""novelty t-shirts and other assorted crap"" store.  If you blink, you'll miss it.  Still, there are a few flat screens on walls and smallish tables here and there.  No bar, which is outside my experience with other BJses. When our food arrived, my youngest (3) announced he had to go to the bathroom. Of course he did...  so off we wandered through the small restaurant to an even smaller bathroom.  The condition of the restroom betrayed the age of the building.  Clearly, this is not a new facility.  Generally musty and marginally lit, although in fairness, cleaner than as described in other reviews.   Kids all ate their food, and my salad was pretty good for a salad.  Of course, they all filled up on chocolate milks, so I got to eat a few slices of their kids pizzas for one. Bonus.  Good food and good service, even if I felt pretty claustrophobic in the small space. I can't speak to the evening ambiance of this place, largely because I'm not that guy that takes three kids 9 and under to a Newport Beach restaurant on a weekend for dinner.  No sense in spoiling the ending for those young couples on dates planning their futures together.  Besides, have I mentioned parking sucks here? Compared to the BJ's in my native Arcadia, which is spacious, well staffed, and holds truer to the restaurant concept of sports bar, the Newport Beach one doesn't quite hold up.  However, if you're ducking in for a quick bite before sitting on the 405 parking lot, it's fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach

Brianne N.,"Irvine, CA",145,91,138,4.0,1/19/2017,"I've now found myself at BJs twice for no reason other than the fact that it was the only place open in the area at that time that catered to under 21 year olds.  It's not a bad place to be. They served my party although two of us ordered food, two of us ordered desserts, and one of us ordered coffee. They get the job done if you're looking for a snack and a place to hang out. Although, I came in around 8 and felt as if they were rushing our group a little. We were the last people there, but they closed at 10.  You can't go wrong with their pizookies (pizza cookies w/ icecream) to satisfy a late night sweet craving or to finish off your meal. Their house-brewed drinks are also very good. Their prices are a little on the expensive side. I payed ~$8 for a regular bowl of tomato soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach
Dave A.,"Campbell, CA",1,46,72,4.0,11/2/2016,"My sweetheart and I dropped in on a Friday evening for some food. The last time I visited there was when I was attending college 25 yrs ago. The weather was perfect, the air was warm. But trying to find a parking spot was a nightmare. We finally walked in the front door ... and to my utter disappointment, they would not let us sit upstairs. I was devastated. We were ushered to our seats at a table near the front window.  The pizza (combo I believe it was), was excellent, the service was prompt and professional. A very romantic evening led to me getting a surprise kiss (TMI) as we ventured out onto the dark pier before heading home ..... You cannot go wrong eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach

David R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",388,1298,1356,5.0,3/13/2016,"I don't like the pizza here, that's what I thought. The truth is that I went here and had pizza 20 years ago and I again didn't like it. It's not a ""real"" deep dish pizza and to me there are way too many really big tomatoes and I don't like tomatoes.  However the Chocolate Chip bouzouki's are to die for. I mean the really good and if you haven't had one you're missing out. So we went back there for a bouzouki and I thought I'd have a salad and watch everyone else in my party eat a disgusting pizza. Then as I was scanning was scanning the menus I was so pleased to see that there are new items on the menu that looked really good. Like a pesto pizza and a BBQ pizza. They had really good looking sandwiches and supper yummy salads.  So I'm here to tell everyone that the new menu is great and again the bouzouki again is yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach

D. C.,"Irvine, CA",2,43,71,5.0,10/9/2016,"This place was so friendly and the staff and manager were awesome. My family never been to BJ's I've been twice in the bay area. The last time was fir a job interview months ago, so anyway now I'm in solcal. My first reaction was wow this place is tiny and normally BJ's I've seen are huge. The outside at night didn't look like much but the real treat was inside. It was my birthday and man the food was so good. I felt drunk leaving and staggering and no I didn't have any alcohol drinks. I ordered the jumbo meatballs I was expecting only 3 meatballs. I ate maybe a dozen and ran out of pasta in my sauce. So I asked our waiter a very nice guy to have the cook boil more noodles. It was perfect since the sauce was so good and the rootbeer wings were excellent. It was something new I love wings and this was a unique flavor I never had. My free dessert was hmmn I don't know what it's called. Piezora ??? Its like ice cream on a cookie I got the salted carmel damn it was good. It was a nice simple meal with my family we all enjoyed our food and service. The place as my wife said it, was a nice cute size. They have 2 levels with tv no nasty smoking sorry if your reading this and your a smoker. I forgot my waitress name he even held the door open on our way out. He had blonde gair full facial hair like a mohawk but not really just comb back. Anyway I'll find out next time  I had a choice of Irvine and I picked Newport. I live in Irvine area and said hmmn kets go in a different area. Also the review stars were higher at this location. Parking well I parked down the street and walked 2mins it was free. The manager was nice I used my coupon I found online I think it was $10- $15 off any order of $35. Also sign up as a rewards premier for BJ's free app.  Thanks I'll be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,4.0,1/17/2016,"We had a few ups and downs at this visit but overall, I'm still fond of this place! Mostly because it's within walking distance from where we stay in Newport. It took awhile to be acknowledged by the obviously frazzled and busy manager on duty. It was a good reminder for me since I work in retail, that to just slow down and say ""I'll be with you in just a minute"" goes a long way! But she did eventually come over to the hostess stand and our party of 10 lucked out since another 10 top had just left. Our server Edwin did a good job taking care of my big, crazy family! Two favorite moments - his patience with my mom who does not want pineapple and my sister in law who does want pineapple, and why don't we just put pineapple on half the veggie pizza? Second favorite moment was when the three kids were all incessantly and loudly ordering chocolate milks and he was able to ignore them, smartly not getting involved. The pizza here is delicious! You cannot beat their deep dish pizza (except Zachary's in Berkeley) My brothers and Dad and I got the large BJ's favorite that is loaded with MEAT ($24.95). Large thin crust cheese for the kids ($10.25) and the medium veggie pizza for Mom and Sis-in-law ($20.95). Added 3 salads for $3.75 each. My Dad really enjoyed the taster set of beer for $7.95.  We finished off the meal with 4 Pizookies: Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate, Peanut Butter and the seasonal Pumpkin ($6.75 ea). Then off to the kids park next to the pier to have the kids run off all that sugar!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach

Myself and about 17 others went just tonight and our server was Ed (Edgar) I believe. He was exceptional - he got all of our orders, was quick with drinks, and bringing anything else out that we may have needed. He demonstrated great professionalism and genuine care. It is not everyday you get that sort of service from a server. That also was a common theme from other employees and the manager that helped served food and such. Great attitudes around. This BJ's is a great restaurant with a great staff, you won't be disappointed.  We also made reservations and was able to get the whole upstairs to ourselves. No hassle or anything.

When we walked in, it took about 5 min before anyone came to seat us. Then once seated we received absolutely 0 service. Like 0. The waiters continued to serve the people around us but seemed to ignore us. Once we had a waiter flagged down it seemed that we were a bother to them. When the waiter came to refresh our beverages he spilled water on the table and said, ""oh sorry,"" and walked away as the water continued to dribble off the table onto my boyfriends leg leaving us to clean up the mess.

Amber T.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,4.0,6/6/2017,"The food was good. We sat outside on the patio and ordered a mini pizza and calamari and a couple of draft beers. The table tent on our table said that happy hour was from 3-7. Since we ordered at 6 we were expecting there to be a discount applied to our check. When the check came I asked our server and she said happy hour is only inside. So, my question is why management would choose to put table tents advertising happy hour on every table outside (There is nothing printed on the table tent that indicates that happy hour is only inside)that are not included in happy hour. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who was surprised when my check came.

We waited about an hour till we realized they were taking way too long for our food. A few minutes later the waitress who took our order came to our table and asked if our manager took our order. This was weird that she asked this because she was the person who took our order. Therefore, I called the manager over to ask if she placed our order and if she did not then cancel it. He walked into the kitchen then walked out and told us, ""I told them to stop making it so do you still want it?"" and I said no and he said, ""are you sure they are starting to make it"" which did not make sense because he just stated that he canceled it.

Jessie L.,"Sacramento, CA",56,114,126,4.0,11/1/2015,"I liked this location because it is on the beach. Parking sucks though. Also there isn't a full bar, so no Irish rootbeer. Our server was a bit rude, but satisfactory. We came for early dinner with my mom on vacation. I didn't see the small bites tomatoe mozzarella salad on the menu, but they did have it. Thank goodness! One of the reasons I come. My counterpart part comes for the Jeremiah Red and the blackened bleu burger. I had a small deep dish with jalapeño and ham. Amazing as always. I love love love their deep dish pizza. My ma had the club Sandwich. All were very tastey. I definitely had to try their pumpkin pazooki. Was very rich, but filled my daily pumpkin void. Very yummy. Try their pumpkin beer too! Pretty good. I have never been disappointed with their good. Not super pricey either. Approx 9-13 per dish.

Iris L.,"Irvine, CA",914,41,26,2.0,8/11/2014,"The upside to this BJ's location is that it's warm, cozy, and next to the beach. Other than that I'm not sure what to say. We went here for a friend's birthday but when we entered I didn't think it would be that small because I've always gone to other BJ locations and it would be a moderate good size. The size didn't bother me too much but the food on the other hand kind of did.  I ordered the Clamchowder soup in a bread bowl and the first thing that I thought of when I took my first sip was that it was way too salty. It felt like they accidentally dropped the salt container in the big pot of soup and thought we wouldn't notice it... I was kind of disappointed too at the same time because you can't really go wrong with clam chowder... but I guess I did go wrong. I also ordered the large BJ Special pizza with my friends and that on the other hand was a better decision. It had  a lot of toppings especially olives, not sure why it was so drenched in olives in comparison to the other ingredients haha. But nonetheless it was good. The crust was soft and it had a nice taste to it.  Since it was my friend's birthday, she got a free pizookie which was delicious!

Kimberly B.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,5,,2.0,7/23/2016,I have been to two BJ's - one in Las Vegas and this one. They were polar opposites. This one had horrible service and poor quality food. The waitress (when she interacted with us which was maybe three times) was exceptionally rude and did not know the menu at all. I asked two specific questions and she answered both incorrectly (I found the correct answer later in the menu). The food took a very long time to come and it was not busy at all. The food was sloppily thrown together on the plate as well. They never did bring the appetizer and my son had a coupon for a free pizzookie and she got irritated about that. I will never go to that BJ's again. The BJ's in Vegas has great service and great food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=40

Only three parties in the place - upstairs seating area closed. Slow business usually equates to excellent service. Which it was. Ian was the perfect server.

Gracie O.,"Honolulu, HI",1,12,3,1.0,12/27/2015,"I came into this BJs last week because I really wanted the kale and Brussel sprout salad. I go to the BJs at the Block in Orange all the time but I figured since I was in the area, I'd stop here. No full bar, that's fine. I'll have a beer. No big deal. So I order my salad and im extremely excited for it. It takes 30 minutes to hit the table. It was seriously the saddest salad that I've ever seen. The kale was old, the Brussel sprouts weren't really roasted and it just looked sad, probably more sad than I did. My server was no where in sight so I had to bug a different server to grab her. When she finally came I explained that the presentation was throwing me off because I have this salad all the time. She went on to say ""our salads are pre-proportioned and that's what it should look like"" Hmmm... I didn't want to waste my time, 1 she didn't understand what I was saying and 2 if she can't offer good service how can she possibly have knowledge of the food?    The manager then came over and asked how everything was, I told him about my experience with the server and he kindly listened and then asked ""did you save room for a pazooki""  I didn't even finish the salad and how was a pazooki supposed to help the fact that the kale and Brussel sprouts were OLD?

Everything about this restaurant experience was perfect from the amazing food to the impeccable service. You would not expect this from a pizza chain. The house hard cider was berry flavored and extremely refreshing. The deep dish pizzas were phenomenal and came with a ton of different topping options, I loved how they had ""mini"" sizes so I didn't have to split with any one ;). To top it off, we were offered a free dessert simply for downloading their app. When I tell you this dessert was the best dessert I've ever had I'm not kidding.

Trish S.,"Escondido, CA",910,82,274,1.0,8/10/2014,"Normally I love BJ's. However I was so disappointed in this one, I will never go back to this one. If you are looking for shots or other liquor they have NO BAR Here.Its literally down the street from the pier and you would think it would have a bar, like the surrounding places but they don't. Their menus also is pretty much cut in half, and doesn't offer like the other BJ's do. YAY when you have picky kids and there's like not so much to chose from.  I always get a Jeremiah Red when I go to BJ's I am not sure what they served but it was not a Jeremiah red. Wasn't even the same color. We were here yesterday, and had the kidos. My oldest ordered a Chicken and Shrimp Cesar salad, and the shrimp was still raw and the chicken was pink..WTF. My youngest ordered the chicken fettuccine plate. He was sick all night and threw up all morning (today). I didn't see what his chicken looked like, but I am assuming that's what it has to be because none of the other kids are sick (they ordered other food). The Birthday boy wanted a Shirley Temple, and again I am not sure what they gave him BUT it wasn't a Shirley Temple. It's not a complex drink. The bathroom was disgustingly gross. All of the toilet paper was sitting on top of the toilet, as if someone was playing tetris with them. The roll holder was just chillin with nothing on them. From the looks of the bathroom it didn't appear to have been cleaned in a LONG TIME.  Its a very small place compared to most of the BJ's I have been too. Was horribly loud. There was a group of 50 somethings who were so loud you literally could not hear the person next to you, or our waitress. They sounded like a bunch of hyenas. I thought I was in Newport not the San Diego Zoo. I would give this place a minus 10 stars. Don't come here you are better going to Taco Bell, at least their bathrooms are clean while you have the runs!

The place was small but there is upstairs and downstairs seating.  We ordered a small pizza, half meat lovers and half with mushrooms. It came out fast and was made with the thick pizza deep dish crust that BJs is known for. A small pizza is more than enough for two people and they did not go cheap on the toppings. The Meat Lovers pizza was packed with ham, sausage, and pepperoni.  We also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip appetizer. The dip was not as chunky but more watery. It tasted okay with the chips, but could be much better. Service: Service was great! Our waitress was friendly. We even told her we were kind of in a rush and she pushed our orders right through the kitchen. I believe she had a waiter in training with her who also helped us out.

Buffalo chicken - I didn't like this one too much, but it wasnt bad. It was literally the flavoring of buffalo wings in pizza form, so you can determine whether or not you want that. Cheeseburger Pizza - As weird as it sounds, this one is my favorite. Like the buffalo chicken, this is literally a cheeseburger in pizza form. I loved it! The Works (i think this is what its called) - came with sausage and pepperoni and what not. - My 2nd fav! its a classic. Cant go wrong with it. If you can't decide on a choice, pick this.

Diane V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",779,434,321,5.0,7/22/2013,"This easily could have been a 3 star experience, but throughout the night it just got better and better.  I came to BJ's for the pizookie and was craving deep dish pizza.  This place is pretty small, especially for a BJ's so we were quoted 25 minutes to wait.   Considering it was a Friday night, that was understandable.  But after waiting 40 minutes, my patience was growing thin.  The hosts did apologize for the longer wait.   We were sat at a table and initially an unpleasant server greeted us.  I had a feeling he was having a bad day or just wanted out of there because he was not exactly all smiles and sunshine.  Some minutes later a more cheerful and positive server, later known to us as Matthew, came up to us and said he would be relieving our previous server.  Thanks goodness!  Some positive energy up in here!  Matthew was awesome.  He was prompt, professional, engaging, and best of all, just an overall cool guy to be around.   We ordered BJ's Favorite Deep Dish pizza, which tasted as good as it sounded, and a pitcher of the cider.  Thick crust and goodness with fresh tasting ingredients - and brought out personally by none other than the kitchen manager himself!  I was in pizza heaven!   The cider was a bit weak and did not taste at all like it had alcohol, but it still tasted good.  For dessert, we ordered a pizookie, half chocolate chip and half red velvet. They were generous with the ice cream, and we ended up with more ice cream than cookie!     To top off the night, the general manager asked us how our meal was, and he was very genuine about it.  That, along with the switch in servers and the delicious meal, made this a 5 star experience.  It looks like most people here complain about the service, but we lucked out and got the best server in the house apparently.  Yay us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=80

The crust is nice and firm and also fresh. The way it is put together nothing falls apart like at other BJs.  This is a much smaller location so it has more of a family feel and intimacy. Your server doesn't get lost and the management team is more hands on then those of the larger stores. I would definitely say that you get the best BJs service at BJs in balboa.  The only thing holding his location from 5 stars is the parking, and the fact that it isn't the full menu, nor do they have all the handcrafted sodas on tap. only the rootbeer!   My favorite is the Orange cream soda which you can't have!

This last time, they ordered kids' personal pizzas without the tomatoes and it came almost sauceless with minimal cheese, but very thick puffy crust. Most adults seem to like the pizza and my father in law enjoyed the chicken fried steak. My chicken wings were good, however the cobb salad left a lot to be desired-- skimpy toppings and small for the price. I would have at least liked the turkey to be grilled or roasted, but it was the cubed deli stuff. We have never had to wait long to be seated. The staff is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is designed to be sporty and lively, there is always television sets playing sports channels and the patrons seem to be happy and talkative. Overall we have experienced good service and a fun, casual atmosphere. BJs is really more of an adult hangout than a family restaurant .

There were no baked potatoes, for example. Now that I think of it, it's been a long time since I've eaten at another BJ's, so maybe they're all like this now. Clearly, I have very little BJ's knowledge, so I'll just move on to what vegan offerings they have. They had a ""light"" menu that had a veggie pasta dish that was vegan-friendly. Just ask to make sure they use oil instead of butter and stuff...you know the drill. I was actually surprised by how good it was. This location obviously gets busy (it's near the Balboa fun center and the pier), so the wait was about 30 minutes for our party of 7 at about 5:30pm on a Friday night in December. The host at the front was really on top of things, though, and we were able to drink a beer in the waiting area.

I haven't been back to original in Newport for a few years now, and so after a day on the water with the family, we couldn't think of a better way to end the day than with a pint and pizza at one of our favorite beach dives.  Now wish I hadn't.  My memories would have been better off.  No longer the charming beachside pizza/brewery hole-in-the-wall it's been remodeled and stripped of any of the character it once had, and replaced with a soulless, corporate- spreadsheet dictated décor that screams, ""We use microwaves!"" with a girlishly guilty squeal.  All highlighted with bullet points in a menu that looks like the addendum to the Cheesecake Factory Menu that includes those few frozen, pre-made items they didn't have room for.     The Pazookies used to be made from scratch.  They took a good 10 minutes, just like when you make cookies at home, and were served with huge scope of good vanilla bean ice cream.   Now they come out in seconds; are pre-made and re-warmed and served with some cheap no-name, imitation fake vanilla ice-cream-like substance that even my kids thought tasted fake.   While the pizza is more or less still the same, it too is now frozen first (at least the dough is, made somewhere else, and costs twice as much.   The stake through the heart though had to be that the ""beer machine"" was broken and they had no beer.  WTF?!  A ""brewery"" that can't properly tap their own kegs.  All they had were Pepsi products.  Freaking Pepsi!  How low can you go.   It was heartbreaking.  It's one thing when a place you love goes under, or just is over and done.  It's another when it's perverted by some cheap corporate model and turned into the Frat House version of Pizza Hut.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=100

Orsolya D.,"North Hollywood, CA",835,800,1415,1.0,11/7/2009,"I am not one to completely bash a restaurant/store/etc...but this going to be my first based on my HORRIBLE experience. If I could give a zero star rating, I would! AWFUL!!!  This is was my first time at a BJ's and NEVER AGAIN will I patron another location or this one again!! I barely know where to begin... A group of 5 of us were celebrating a girlfriend's 29th birthday on a Thursday night. It was 9:30 and we were looking for dinner so to be respectful, we called BJ's to ask when they close and if they can serve a party of 5 at this time. We were told that the resturant closes at 10:30 and that they would love to serve us.  We show up to an almost-empty restaurant with the crew instantly giving us death-stares which signaled the, ""We wanted to close up so why are you here?"" mentality. We already called to get an ""okay"" so this was unacceptable. Despite this, we are seated and receive poor service instantly. Our first waiter was a young man who looked under 16 wearing flip flops and shorts claiming to not even work at the resturant but was ""helping a friend"". He took our drink orders but could only get water and not alcohol to he sent another waitress over. She arrives and gives us a sharp attitude. I ask for a drink and was denied because my license expired a few days ago. I told her how I already went to the DMV to get my new one but that they send it in the mail and it takes 2 weeks but I have the paper from the DMV, as well. Not to mention, even if the license is expired, you can still see that I am much over 21. My birthday does NOT decrease with an expired license. She explained that it was ""against the law"" to serve me. I understand if this was the case, but it was the WAY she explained the situation speaking to me like I was an underage teenager trying to purchase a drink. VERY RUDE and CURT.  Two members of our party purchased drinks. We were served by yet ANOTHER waiter (waiter #3) who brought the drinks and took our meal orders... to which we found out that they ""shut the ovens down an hour ago"" so we could ONLY order the pizzas. Why was this not explained immediately when the menus were placed into our hands?! And AGAIN, we called ahead of time to make sure we weren't coming into the restuarant too late. Then, the birthday girl got reprimanded for holding two drinks (we were taking pictures of a drink in each hand). We were told she can't drink two drinks at a time. Um, we were taking pictures, buddy. The actual food was suitable. Not the best pizza I've ever had. The toppings appeared undercooked and raw. The cheese was not even melted. The high light was the pizookie that the birthday girl received for free, HOWEVER, it was raw cookie dough and so underbaked that we didn't even finish it.  We finally receive our receipt to which we see that we were charged incorrectly with an added item on the receipt. This happens after we had to REMIND the waiter that he hasn't given a soda re-fill to one of our members after she already asked for one.  We pay our check and all employees dissapear and I literally had to peak my head into the kitchen to ask for our parking validation. Overall, this was one of the worst resturant experiences of my life. I'm from LA county so maybe Orange County BJ's are not up to par or maybe it is just this location. Either way, first impressions say a million words and I can safely conclude that I will NEVER eat here again and encourage others not to do so, either. I am highly disspointed especially because we were trying to celebrate a 29th birthday and were treated like 9 year olds. STAY AWAY FROM BJ'S!!! HORRIBLE!!!!! I'd rather eat a hot dog from a street-side vendor...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=120

People who compare it to the new, jumbo sized, cookie cutter BJ's that were built in every new shopping center over the past couple years ... well, you just don't get it.  Yes, this place is small. But it is a two story original location with tons of character.  This is what BJ's was back in the day when they were 'all about the pizza', before they added 10 pages to their menu to try and compete with Claim Jumper and Cheesecake Factory.  I have been coming to this location in Balboa since I was in high school! I was in Balboa last weekend and we stopped in here for dinner.  It always brings back lots of good memories from back in the day.  The place was busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Atmosphere was great.  Highly recommend: BJ'S BACON CHEESEBURGER- Ground Angus beef, red onions, Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes and chopped dill pickles drizzled with signature burger sauce.

The upstairs tables are nicely tucked away in order to give that semblance of privacy for a private conversation. The service is fantastic and the waiters/waitresses are very respectful. I never felt rushed or hassled by the staff and genuinely appreciated the prompt attention by the servers when called upon.

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/28/2009,"This location is very small. But, unlike the one in Huntington beach it was not overly crowded. I assume in the summer months it gets that way though.  The view is amazing. They are about 30 feet from the sand on the beach.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. Overall I would say they have a smaller menu than other BJ's. Maybe less salad etc. They also seem to lack some of the options that a full bar would offer.  But, on the upside this location is a lot more quaint, cool, and romantic than some of the other BJ's I have been too.

I think I kept from giving it 4 stars because I am kicking myself for not remembering my box of leftovers.  I had only eaten a bite on my sandwich and maybe 10 fries, so it was essentially my full meal left behind!  I know this isn't their fault, but I am still pissy about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newport-beach?start=140
