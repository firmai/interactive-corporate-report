11,Donald M.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",1,145,5.0,2.0,2013-01-26,"Food was OK but nothing special.  After I looked at the bill and gave my credit card, they returned the charge sheet for signature with an increased amount- added a drink I didn't have.  They corrected the charge when called on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
10,H B.,"Cedmont, Baltimore, MD",6,33,31.0,3.0,2015-01-17,"I have always heard franchise restaurants quality of food, drinks and service is always below standards in small towns. This Applebee's is no exception. I ordered a perfect margarita which has 1800 tequila, Cointreau and grand marnier. The bartender made my perfect margarita with cheap tequila and sweet & sour. After tasting it and noticing the awful taste I questioned as to what type of tequila was used (mind you I was watching ) Of course the answer was 1800, the bartender however offered me another shot(knowingly he didn't use 1800) After that shot it made a huge difference it actually tasted like a ""perfect margarita"". I guess you have to speak out to get not only what you order but what's stated on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
8,paula j.,"Millersville, MD",2,42,8.0,3.0,2015-03-09,"Food was sub par. Got chicken penne with some curly over cooked noodles. Got boneless wings as an appetizer and they came after the food.      The 3 star review is for the wonderful server and hostess who were overly apologetic and very helpful.  Thank you, ladies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
7,Christian J.,"Annapolis, MD",5,7,4.0,1.0,2015-07-12,"It was nice meeting you all but to wait 10 mins for drinks and 15 only just to get served? You won't be seeing me again... Do better, my goodness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
3,Jessica L.,"Rockville, MD",168,209,841.0,1.0,2015-07-16,"Coming back from the beach and sick of beach food, we thought we would stop here for dinner.  We were seated in the side room in the middle of a bunch of screaming kids. That would have been fine if that was the only table available but the place was half empty.  We waited about 10 minutes for our server. She had a terrible attitude from the start. As soon as we told her we were doing the 2 for 20$ special she rolled her eyes as if to say she knew her tip would be small based on the tip percentage of 20$ and she had a horrible attitude the entire meal. Our onion rings came out with BARBEQUE sauce and she just said oh well. Use it for your chicken tenders. My husbands chicken tenders were dried out and looked like a kids meal. My lime chicken was cold and the only thing lime about it was the lime wedge on the plate.  We had to flag her down for refills and she never cleared any dirty dishes so we sat there with dirty side plates and empty glasses while we tried to eat.  The server then loudly told the couple next to us that their credit card was declined and slapped their card on their table. And when a mother with her two small children ordered the 2 for 20$ special she loudly said ""it figures!""  And they had to ask for silverware after their meals came.  There was a manager lady walking around asking people if everything was ok but the server was hovering only then so we couldn't really say anything then.  My advice is to avoid this place if you don't want attitude for not ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. Or if you want your food to be hot or if you want silverware with your meal or a refill.  Or avoid the busomy server with the dark blonde hair that wears a ton of make up and a choker necklace with large wooden keys on it. She seems to think she is deserving of your hard earned money when she can't even do her job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
5,Derek S.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",128,6,8.0,1.0,2015-12-15,"Terrible, would be one word to describe the place as a whole. Service was awful, my ""well done"" steak was close to bleeding. Salad was ready about 30seconds before the food was served but then all three plates of food came out about 2 minutes apart. And the server said so I quote ""I don't know what's going on with your food right now but my manager is looking into it"" not exactly a reassuring feeling that your good at your job. If your not looking for salad and or beer, or something that cannot be screwed up, then don't attend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
6,Jake B.,"Orem, UT",70,4,,1.0,2016-01-21,"Nothing like getting take out just to find out your food is still frozen in the center. I didn't realize I was going to McDonald's, where they take it from the freezer and throw it in the microwave. Really have some respect for your work.. I've had better gas station food! Really, just because you take 10 times longer doesn't mean you can charge 10 times as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
9,Erin B.,"Harrington, DE",1,52,,1.0,2016-03-01,"My boyfriend and I ate at the Easton Applebees on Friday night. We are avid Applebees eatters, and frequent this location often. Friday night we went and as soon as we walked in their were about 6 workers/hostess standing up front talking crowding the door. They kept talking and laughing and no one hardly acknowledged us. Then when we were seated, I immediately noticed how dirty the floor under our table was, and the walkway in front of our row of tables. There were napkins, a fork, several straw rappers, and other trash all over the floor. I thought maybe it was just bad timing but all of this stuff laid in the floor for the remainder of the meal. I figured we just sat in a busy spot, but realized the whole place was nasty when I got up to use the bathroom. I could not get over how messy the floors were. Any one of the 6 chatting hostess could have taken 3 min. to sweep and pick up the napkins and crayons, and silverware off the floor. I always order the Oriental Chicken Salad every time I'm at an Apple Bees, but Friday night something just wasn't right with the salad. I have ate this same salad over 40 times and know how it tastes.I also had to wait 15 minutes for a drink because my waiter, who was very good and friendly, said that the tea had to be brewed. We were over charged, both of our meals were on the 2for20 but were rang up separately. By that time we were just ready to leave and paid the full higher price. Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
4,Donna B.,"Preston, MD",0,6,,1.0,2017-05-08,This is franchise at it's worst. The food has no flavor or imagination. This is just a step above cafeteria food. They need to get back to basics and start farm to table ingredients.Got a gift card for my birthday and I would not give this  away to my worst  enemy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
1,Ian H.,"Woodbridge, VA",180,14,19.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"Dirty, smudged, sticky table.  Dirty plates and silverware.  I asked if they could please clean the table and was told, ""it looks clean to me."" I regret trying the food at all.  Even the milk for my daughter was sour.   My recommendation is just do not go to this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
2,Steady S.,"Salisbury, MD",60,6,,1.0,2017-10-09,"This is a poorly managed establishment,so ""MANAGEMENT""really needs to be addressed at this location but the service was good enough for an additional star other then that Applebee's as a franchise establishment has got to do a lil more for the non meat eater ..With that being said,unless your starving without any other options I wouldn't recommend Applebee's...P.S I settled for the ,Fire Cracker shrimp Cav.,and it was defiantly a two thumbs down dish..won't be returning and taking one star back,service was good enough for one star...Enjoy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
0,Logan K.,"Easton, MD",59,105,19.0,5.0,2017-11-27,"I've been coming to this Applebees location since it opened over 10 years ago. The staff is always super friendly and the food comes out fast and is good. The managers are always walking around the dining room, checking in with guests....its rare to find restaurants with management who seem to truly care. Make sure to check out the half priced apps after 9! Can't tell you how many date nights we've had over boneless wings... And there's always a good drink special at the bar! Go see Brian, he's the best bartender in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-easton-4,,,,,
