Venton C.,"Waldorf, MD",0,20,17,4.0,12/19/2017,"What can I say, they sell hamburgers. I think they do have a good selection, although they are starting to overwhelm people with the choices. I do like the tower of onion rings and the bottomless fries are a good deal. I have been here since they first opened and have never really had a complaint. The service is usually good and the food is a little above average. Great spot if you are looking for something quick and in the mood for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf
James B.,"Accokeek, MD",5,48,10,3.0,1/2/2018,"This a typical chain restaurant with nothing special to official. Basic burger and fries joint. I find the burgers to be small, lack luster and over priced for what you get. My kids like the tortilla soup so we go here way more than justified. Fries and milk shakes are really good.

Will S.,"Falls Church, VA",27,18,17,1.0,8/26/2017,I wish I could give them a -1.  The nachos had no cheese.  My burger was dry and this is a burger joint.  My fruit wasn't even fresh.  This place will be gone in 2 years because management isn't monitoring the subpar food before it is served.  Service wasn't stellar either.  Avoid this place if you're looking quick and attentive service.  The managers are under experienced and lack the ability to make on the spot decisions.  Dear District Manager please save yourself the embarrassment and overhaul the entire staff for below standard performance and the inability to serve quality food to loyal paying customers.  Dear Regional Manager please fire the District Manager for taking light of this warning and not putting forth the effort to ensure a stellar performance from his/her staff because it is only a matter of time before this location becomes a Suntrust Bank.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf

Nicholas A.,"White Plains, MD",100,200,94,5.0,8/31/2016,"It may be a bit hard to categorize Red Robin. Is it a ""better burger"" chain like BGR or Five Guys? Or is it best thought of as a casual sit down place like Friday's or Ruby Tuesday? Either way, this location in particular is proabably the best Red Robin I've ever been too.  The service is friendly and competent if not always as speedy as it could be. So far, all the burger I've ate are all great. They seem to create new sandwiches from time to time, which is an A+ in my book.  The unlimited refills on many sides are great of you are hungry. The donut tower and onion ring towers are great appetizers before any meals.  All-in-all a GREAT place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf

Our server Ms Krystal, immediately accepted & placed the order for my younger son (extreme picky-eater), while the rest of us placed drink & appetizer orders. We ordered Towering Onion Rings, Four Cheese Melt, Royal Red Robin, Bacon Cheese Burger & Blackened Salmon w/broccoli & cole slaw. I didn't sample any of the sandwiches, but everyone voiced satisfaction for their choice. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly! Ms Krystal was very friendly & attentive, provided drink & bottomless fries w/o being asked.

Jared answers the phone, puts you on hold right away for carry out (on a Monday night) for 14 minutes so we call from another number he puts you on hold right away, 8 minutes later called from another number and asked to speak with the manager because we have called three times and just got tossed on hold. he states there is no manager to talk to and he's going to put us on hold mockingly then clicks off.????

I got the burger well done and it was so juicy.  After you bit into the burger it literally melts away in your mouth like butter baby.  Ooooh Oooooh Oooooh ... just reminiscing on this burger makes me want to do the happy dance.  The burger also came with a fried egg, bacon, lettuce, a tomato on a burger bun.  They all stood in the shadows when it came to the taste of the burger.  Don't get me wrong, they were all delicious compliments, however the main attraction (the burger) stole the show. I also got a soda.  Can't grade that because a soda is a soda is a soda.

Sonday K.,"Brandywine, MD",28,40,80,5.0,3/4/2016,"I love this Red Robin. We come here often with the kids. The food is always good and made correctly. Employees are always friendly and they have great servers. I don't ask for Kiera, but I am always happy when they seat us in her section! (I only remember her name because we were going to name our daughter that- no such luck, 3 boys. I'm done!) And, she is great with the kids.  Unlimited fries? What! Drinks are good. I have a Red Robin loyalty card so every now and then I'm surprised that the bill is low because a burger was free.  This place must have a really good manager because they have been going strong for years. Most places go downhill in this area after awhile.

The towering doh rings look good on the menu but was a letdown. Looked nothing like the menu and both the fudge and raspberry sauce were not great.  Service friendly but very slow removing dishes.

Joe H.,"Waldorf, MD",0,2,,1.0,10/5/2015,"Stay away from this Red Robin. My take-out today actually stunk and the bottom bun was soaked to the point I was scared to eat it and it was falling apart when I open it up to find out what the smell was. If you want a good burger, stay away from this Red Robin. Review Addition .....  I wish I would of read the prior Yelp review on 10/03/2015 before my review, I would of never gone to this Red Robin. That review is worse than my food today. I was lucky enough to smell the issue with my food before I started eating. It is clear the management has done nothing to resolve the issues with this Red Robin. After my issues and the reviewer before me, appears you will take your own health in your hands if you eat at this Red Robin. Be aware if you eat here, you may not get lucky like me and the previous reviewer where we could see and smell the issues with the food. If the viewable issues are happening with the food twice in a few days, I wonder if anyone should eat normal looking food from this Red Robin. Clearly there are no public safety concerns in place.

Natasha S.,"Washington, DC",313,1495,618,4.0,10/14/2010,"I never was a fan of Red Robin. So I wasn't too excited about coming here but my girlfriend's family love it so I tagged along. I was very impressed. Our young server was EXTREMELY attentive and ensured our drinks never got half empty. We ordered some appetizers which I thought were fresh and pretty good. I got a turkey burger with the garden works of onions, mushrooms, avocado and wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. I loved this concept for a long time, and love that many more restaurants are offering it. It was pretty damn good, super filling and the freckled lemonade here is great. Lemonade with chunks of delicious strawberries. Now only if they could use fresh squeezed lemonade, but I guess that would be asking too much. Overall, this place has improved a great deal since I last tried it - over 4 years ago!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60

Heather G.,"Alexandria, VA",319,314,247,5.0,2/13/2010,This place is consistently good. The staff is very attentive. Never have a problem with getting the food quickly or at the right temperature. I like the fact that the managers are always circulating to ask how your meal is. My favorite is the bonzai burger - minus the lettuce and tomato. The steak fries with the seasoning salt are fantastic. The milkshakes plus the strawberry lemonade are money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60
Robin L.,"Prince Frederick, MD",4,34,1,3.0,8/1/2011,"Just ok. Maybe it was an off day there or something. We have eaten at the St. Mary's location several times and I have had better meals there.

RJ F.,"Waldorf, MD",9,18,,4.0,2/8/2009,"Waldorf's RR is pretty good (I've only been to one other which was also good) and we go here a couple times a month.  Always clean and friendly.  Even when they are crowded, which is often, there is rarely a long wait.  They have tons of different burgers, which is their specialty, so if burgers are your thing you're bound to find something to try here. One nice thing is that they offer unlimited steak fries with their sandwiches, and will even bring some to you while you wait for your food to be ready, so there isn't even a need to order an appetizer unless you want something different.  I have had a few different meals here but my favorite, which I usually get, is the fish burger - fried fish on a burger bun with tartar sauce and shredded cabbage.  I sub fried onions for the tomatoes, and substituting is never a problem.  They also have started serving garlic parmesan fries (YUM!) which I sometimes get too.  Depending on your server, you may or may not get charged extra for them (only certain sandwiches come with those fries, but some servers will just give them to you without charging).  My husband and I also like the Freckled Lemonade, which is lemonade with strawberries and a dash of strawberry syrup... yum! The only thing that bugs me about RR is how often the managers come around and ask how things are going.  I know it's their job but sometimes it just gets annoying to try to answer repeatedly with your mouth full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60
Cindy T.,"Waldorf, MD",1,20,1,2.0,4/6/2014,"I had lunch here on Saturday, April 5th. I had a taste for a Red Robin burger, since my last experience hit the spot. Yum! Well, I did something I don't normally do, which is stray from what I know works best for me. I tried a new menu option. The DGB. It had my favorites...arugula, roasted tomatoes with Angus meat. I requested my usual well done option. I also ordered the freckled lemonade too. Don't bother unless you don't mind sweetening it yourself. Well my yummy burger came back and I was already to dive in after putting some fixings on it. I cut it in half and I have a medium cooked burger. Now, I knew something was up when it arrived because it was more burnt on the outside which indicates it was cooked too fast. That's BBQ/GRILLING 101. I had it sent back and about 15 min. later it arrived. Better than the first, but I just ate around the pink and took the other 1/2 home to doctor it up. So, this was not my best experience with the food. The service was great until the end. When the young lady returned my card, she was waiting on another table and just turned around and placed it on my table. No have a good day, nothing. Needless to say she did not get my usual 20% tip. I chuck this up to the luck of the draw for the day. Just wasn't my day. I will go back again and hope for a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60

Edward S.,"Waldorf, MD",0,7,1,3.0,6/3/2013,"Adequate service. The menu offers moderate variety.  My daughter loves this place for the Mac and cheese.  I've enjoyed the fish and chips and nachos on previous visits. My wife seems to like the chicken sandwich. The fries are pretty good. Sadly, the burgers are a disappointment. The meat lacks true beef flavor. I had the bacon guac burger and I was unable to differentiate any of the favors of any ingredients in the burger. The meat was by itself, dry.  The bacon by itself lacked any smokiness or salt.  The bread is fairly dry and waxy.  Dry bread is generally welcome when mixed with a juicy burger. This is a corporate restaurant and as such, the food is ""sterile"" and leaves your stomach and body full but not enriched as a good meal should.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60
