49,Rania G.,"Beverly Hills, FL",68,166,149.0,5.0,2016-10-26,"This restaurant has always been good to me, and is a solid 4.5 stars, but since the first few reviews have been a bit harsh for this location, I feel like being generous. I have never opened a restaurant, but I would imagine it must be hard - no matter how much training - to open a new place with all new employees and be perfect right out of the gate.  First thing I need to say is that they are, hands down, the most allergen friendly restaurant I have been to so far. They have a comprehensive list of all their foods and an easy to read chart with all the major allergens (not just wheat). Now, they do have a separate, just gluten free menu, but for those that have other allergies, this chart is amazing. I ordered a broccoli cheese soup cup as a starter, and it was creamy, rich, and flavorful (and huge, not the typical ""cup"" size). I ordered a side house salad with Italian dressing, and it was fresh and a good size. For the meal I got a gluten free pizza with various toppings. It was not the best gluten free crust I have had flavor-wise, but it was still pretty good. My friends got the deep dish baked ziti (which I was told was flavorful and creamy in a good way) and the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs (and they weren't exaggerating, those balls were like grapefruits). For an appetizer they shared the crisp potato skins, and informed me they were very thick cut and therefore very heavy.  Service was fast and friendly. The manager also came by to assure me that they would respect my allergy to wheat and eggs and that everything would be safe to eat. That was a nice touch, because eating out has become a scary unknown, and his promise really did take a load off my shoulders. I hope people are not swayed by some of the early reviews and give them a chance, they are really trying and as far as American food chains go, this is one of the better ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-lutz?start=20,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998
114,Pat M.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,,1.0,2016-10-27,"Absolutely horrible experience. There was a long wait for the food, the server was aloof and uncaring, but the worst part of all was due to some ""technical problem,"" it took nearly an hour to get the check. Management was completely inept and uncaring. The right thing to do in that situation would be to comp the meal, but no. Just a lame apology--no discount, no free dessert or drink, no compensation at all for the huge inconvenience caused by them and them alone. Definitely won't be returning to this location.

Literally 15 people standing around talking and gossiping; management, servers, and kitchen staff included. Not only was it distracting, the service was terrible. Good food is only half of the equation and the fact that the management team didn't seem concerned that our bill got lost and just shrugged and walked back over to the 'party' was the cherry on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-lutz?start=80,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
47,Amy K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",311,449,1708.0,5.0,2016-11-01,"Stopped by here with a friend today for lunch and I am so glad I did! I live close by and forgot that they had opened at the Outlet Mall in Wesley Chapel. I had been to a BJ's in St Augustine last year and had a nice experience, but this visit blew me away! While this location is still new and establishing itself as an asset in the area, the staff did a great job of doing everything possible to have us enjoy our visit.  FOOD: OMG really good! Large portions cooked to perfection and so flavorful. We ordered the boneless wings (garlic parm with a side of EXXXXtra hot buffalo sauce!), Chips with Piranha Pale Ale Chili Queso and the beef sliders with fries. We ordered wayyyyyy too much and have tons of leftovers. The amount of wings they give you for $10.95 is outstanding! They were crunchy and large in size. While I did not find the buffalo sauce to be deemed EXXXXtra hot...it was tasty and I took some home. The sliders were really good too for $10.50, although the mini buns were too large for the meatball size of a patty that was on it. Still good, plus the fries were under $2 to add on and had that crispy battered Burger King-like texture on the outside. Finally, the chips with chili queso dip were on par ($5.95). The queso was made with BJ's own Piranha Pale Ale and the chips tasted house made. There was plenty to go around and the chips are unlimited. YUM! Last but not least, my friend signed up for their rewards program and instantly got a free Pizookie which is a little cookie topped with ice cream. We sampled the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was outstanding! DRINKS: They have something for everyone here! Full bar and plenty of craft drafts to choose from. Prices are great in my opinion. I started with a flight of their house beers (4 beers, 5 oz. each for $7.95). I had the Hopstorm IPA, Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red and the Berry Burst Cider. Can't complain about any of them. I also had a fusion drink with Jeremiah Red and Berry Burst Cider which was delicious! Beers are between $5-$7. I don't believe they brew on premises.  Our servers (one in training and one was the trainer) were polite, cheerful and accurate. They let us know up front that they would be working together for training purposes. They were fantastic and I look forward to receiving their service in the future! According to my check, one was named Kristina H and I hope she and her training partner will be commended for their wonderful attitudes and hospitality! Clean restaurant with awesome staff and certainly a great place to bring your friends and family.

29,Joel H.,"Tampa, FL",248,322,315.0,4.0,2016-11-23,"I don't get the lack of love for this place (currently a two star rating). I've eaten at two star restaurants. I've even eaten at a two star BJ's before. This location is leaps and bounds above that. A two star BJ's makes you wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though the restaurant is have full. Every time I've visited the Lutz location (three currently) I've gotten in and seated within a reasonable amount of time even though every booth (and the bar) was full.  A two star BJ's has a very inattentive server and kitchen staff who brings out the wrong order, does not work around dietary restrictions (despite their menu saying they will) and leaves your glass empty for most of the meal. At this BJ's the server is checking on us constantly. My glass of water remains full for the duration of the evening. The longest I waited for it to be refilled was two minutes. When I order the Brussels Sprouts, I get the honey sricha sauce on the side. Not once have they failed to clarify my order and bring it out correctly. As for the taste of the sprouts, whoa doggy. Nicely charred and crispy and tossed in oil. Better Brussels Sprouts than I've had at any other Tampa restaurant. Even my meat eating, butter loving, fat indulging friends can't keep their hands off them (and that's without the sauce, who knows how it would be if they offered a vegan sauce for those sprouts). For my main course, I am enamored with BJ's vegan lentil soup. I've eaten it both as a bread bowl (hold the butter) and regular bowl. The soup is filling, slightly spicy and flavorful. Rare is it to find a chain restaurant in Tampa offering a vegan soup. Even rarer is the restaurant that offers a really good vegan soup. On one occasion I ordered the mushroom and asparagus salad (sans goat cheese). If I had to do it over again, I'd get the dressing on the side. I don't have the same love affair with dressing as a lot of people so I usually find the amount that restaurants put on to be too much. BJ's was no different. A two star BJ's has people working there that are unable to answer questions about the menu. At the Lutz location we had a gluten free diner seated with us. She asked for the gluten free menu and they obliged. She decided to order the gluten free pizza and asked the server about toppings. The server said all toppings were gluten free except for the meatballs. When another friend inquired about what barbacoa was, the waitress gave her best answer and then double checked with someone else in order to ensure that my fellow diner could make an informed decision. A two star BJ's does not bring out a garlic roll for the toddler who might be just a little less patient about waiting for her food. The Lutz location served my daughter a drink and a complimentary roll right away. I thought this was a fabulous idea because my daughter is still at the age where she tells me she wants mac and cheese and she thinks it should be there moments later. The roll helped to stem the constant ""where is my mac and cheese questions"" because she had something to snack on. Does this location have some kinks to work out? Probably. They mixed up checks once when I was there. Had her drinks on his and vice versa. But considering that they are restaurant that has been open just a little over a month, I'd say some kinks are to be expected.  Kinks and all, I'm definitely a fan of BJ's.

Their R and D did a good job to come out the menu. It is very likable. The tuna is seasoning and seared outward. The salad has good dressing and good selection of ingredients. Crispy wonton skin and pickle ginger add the flavor to the salad.  The salmon is almost like blacken outside with good spice. The quinoa is well cook. I like this dish the most.

It's my favorite chain but I gotta tell you this experience has been nothing short of awful. First we had a 50 minute wait.... then we got sat (Party of 7) split among two tables and then the two waters were drama and after were sat and kids were coloring, they asked us to move. They crammed us into a table... the server was not polite. They brought out our order and several things were wrong. Of those things, a friend ordered a portabella burger (she's a vegetarian) and it came out with meat and when she asked the waitress about it, she got an attitude and said it comes with meat. After some discussion she said she'd get it brought out without meat. We also sat around waiting for drinks. All the adults were having drafts or ciders but it was a real challenge to get more. Our service was some of the worst we've ever had. To say I'm disappointed is putting it lightly. The margarita pizza came out and it looked like a totinos version of a flatbread.

116,Patti L.,"Land O Lakes, Land O Lakes, FL",7,6,1.0,2.0,2017-01-02,So I generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review. My husband and I arrived and were placed on the wait list. No big deal. Some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order. The pizza was no better than Pizza Hut. We were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza. The artichoke dip came out. Most of the chips were small pieces. Hardly suitable for dipping. The waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins. She seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those. The flat bread pizza was something kids could make. On grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients.  To me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price. Expected higher quality for the price. The appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive. Probably won't go back because there are local non-chain restaurants that are far better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-lutz?start=80,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.8880000000000003,3.0800000000000005

Not to mention we already waited for more than 70 mins at that moment. We complained to the manager, she handled it very professionally, appreciated us letting her know and offered us free appetizer or gift card(we DID NOT accept them, because we feel we should still pay for what we order). We were honest and told her the hostess ruined the whole experience for our family, and we most likely will never come back.

Now getting to the food.  Overall the food was okay, I got the fish tacos(mahi mahi and shrimp taco, my husband got a soup in a bread bowl.

What I really disliked about my order was the salsa and guacamole(not sure what it was but it looked like a sad attempt at guac) The guac had a weird consistency almost like tooth paste I didn't even want to try it.

We normally don't go out to eat very much because it takes a long time to communicate with the waiter/waitress and chef to see if there's something he can eat, but BJ's was prepared for customers with allergies and extremely helpful and accommodating. That in of itself makes it worth it to come back regularly for us. Our waitress was fantastic and really helpful.

20,Randy K.,"Tampa, FL",29,29,3.0,3.0,2017-03-16,"Well, we have been to BJ's twice now, so here is what we think. The good: BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long. The bad: BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long. BJ's is one of those restaurants that cannot decide if it is a steakhouse, a brew house, an Italian restaurant, a pizza parlor, a rib joint, or a burger place. As is so frequently the case with restaurants that try to do so many things, it ends up not doing any of them very well. The servers seem to have a lot of trouble answering questions, because there is such a massive amount to remember. Frequently they have to pass such tough questions as ""can I get that with mushrooms"" on to the kitchen manager, who appears to be in a black hole from which your server may never return. On to the food. First visit we had salmon, which had a very nice flavor but was a bit over cooked. This time we first ordered calamari as an appetizer,which was nicely battered and fried with good marinara and horseradish dipping sauces. We then both ordered the rib eyes, each medium rare. The cooking was fine. The quality of the meat was terrible. We have been around a good while, and these were the toughest, most gristly rib eyes we have ever eaten, or at least tried to eat. When we arrived home, Rex the amazing wonder dog ended up eating most of them. He thought they were great. Then again, he eats cat litter. Grandson had a burger and fries, which he gave his 8 year old's thumbs up to. If the ketchup on his face was any measure, both must have been good. Beer selection was wide but not more than the average brew house. So all in all, a great big mediocre for BJ's.

Our 11-yr-old grandson liked the hickory brisket and bacon burger and our 8-yr-old pizza lover really likes the puffy mini cheese pizza on the kids menu. He says it's better than Chili's, which was his previous fave. Both kids highly recommend the fries, which are pretty fine.  We think the spaghetti and meatballs aren't as good as they were 10 yrs ago, and we were sad to find that Santa Fe spring rolls are no longer on the menu.

It's a mixture of a berry cider and Jeremiah Red. Delicious. Sounds crazy, but I love it.  Their pizza is really good. The crust isn't too thick/thin and has just the right amount of crunch for me. I love the meat lovers, pepperoni, and chicken bacon ranch.   The burgers are pretty good. So is the club sandwich.  And if you are getting dessert, get a pizookie.

25,Alicia C.,"Orlando, FL",74,24,41.0,3.0,2017-06-26,"Ah, BJ's. I always hope it will be wonderful, and sometime it is. But oh, when it is bad, it is horrid. First, the menu. Delicious choices all around, from pizza to salads to grilled entrees. The menu descriptions always tempt me, but the problem is the consistency of the food itself. One item, for example, was both my favorite and one reason I avoided BJ's for a period of time. The Ahi Tuna Salad when I first had it was an absolute delight. The tuna pieces were perfectly seared, and the salad was fresh with a light, slightly sweet sesame vinaigrette that set off the tuna perfectly. I was besotted with the salad. I came back the next day to have it again. Delicious, yet again. Excited, I brought my fiancee late one evening after a show. ""You have to try the Ahi Tuna Salad,"" I said. He obeyed, as all good fiancees should. And then, guess what? The perfect salad disintegrated into the most horrid pile of sludge. The ahi was not in perfect slabs of tuna goodness. Oh, no. They were mushed together pieces of raw fish that looked like they had been run over by a semi a few times before being put on the plate. Gone was the slightly sweet vinaigrette. In its place was a pickle-like melange of veggies that were so tart that it was impossible to eat. It was inedible. And what did the server say about the situation? ""That's the way the salad always is."" Nope. Not good enough. I didn't order fish mash on top of pickles. I ordered the salad I've had twice before from the same kitchen. On the other hand, it can be fantastic. The lunch specials are especially good deals, especially the unlimited soup and salad. The offerings are tasty, and it's a great way of getting a taste of what BJ's has to offer. Again, the food can be uneven. More than once, the mozzarella salad has arrived to my table partially frozen, which isn't the most appetizing of lunch items. When it's good, however, it's very good. The tomato soup is out of this world, and the chili is spicy enough to keep my interest. The wedge salad can have a bit too much dressing, but it's also consistently good. Really, that's the only reason I go to BJ's at all: the unlimited soup and salad is such a good deal that it's worth the risk, especially for that tomato soup. Second, the service. Sigh. Service is simple: greet me within a couple of minutes, keep my drink refilled, and take my order promptly. At BJ's, getting all three of those things is iffy at best. Some servers are terrific. Some appear not to want to be bothered if you're not ordering alcohol. Some appear new to the waiting tables game. Others appear to have been doing it too long. Regardless, you never know who will step up to your table. I'm giving this place a 3 star review because on occasion, like my experience today, the food is good and the service is outstanding. Today, my drink was refilled constantly, the app worked correctly on my phone (it's a 50/50 chance you'll be able to use it without a manager needing to manually type in your membership number), and the soup and salad were stellar. The unevenness, however, makes me hesitate to recommend it to others, even with the sometimes great food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-lutz?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.0840000000000005,3.2800000000000002

I think that your team needs to have some urgency and make sure all the guest in the building are happy. This whole concept of sitting your servers 10 tables at once and thinking they are giving above and beyond service is ridiculous.

We ordered our food and had them bring the kids food out first. My daughter's soup was not hot. I thought MAYBE since it was for a child, they brought it so it wouldn't burn her mouth. We then overheard another table sending their food back because it was brought out cold.  My husbands plate looked phenomenal, and he said it tasted that way. He ordered a California club.  I ordered the spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles. Mine tasted good. However the amount of chicken you get in this dish is about 1 tenderloin cut up.

To date, it's my favorite BJ's-- it has high ceilings that are creatively fascinating, a large open concept (three square sections w/ no full dividing walls), a modern & lighted bar area, a selection of 51 beers listed on the wall, & a variety of booths. (Ours was spacious, comfortable & open on each end; access was easy.) The dining area appeared clean & modern. Service was very good after our 20 min wait to be seated. Overall, the food was above average. The Avocado Egg Rolls appetizer was beyond excellent-- & beyond fattening (1,060 calories). My ""enlightened"" lower cal meal (520) was well-seasoned & filling-- Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. (See pic.) The bowl of Tuscan Tomato Bisque was excellent, although high in calories-- 560. (See pic.) The Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos entree was good as well (See pic.), but contained just one candied pecan piece, & the side of sweet potato fries was flavorful, but not in large supply. (It's doubtful this $10.99 two taco meal would satisfy a hungry man.) This business is close to the entrance of a very busy shopping area (Tampa Premium Outlets), but there are considerable parking spaces.

77,Haley W.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",46,7,,1.0,2017-09-12,"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. This is by far the worst dining experience I have had since moving to Tampa. I had an extremely simple order, and it was made wrong not once, not twice, but three times. Every time it was made wrong, the waitress just stared at me, no apologies or anything, and made me ask for the ingredients. The burger was supposed to be topped with cranberries, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, red wine vinegarette, baby greens, and chargrilled onions. The first time, I literally just got a burger with a tomato slice and a raw onion slice. Obviously not what I ordered. The waitress just stared at me and I had to ask for a new one. The second time, they just threw on a few pieces of greens and a few cranberries. Still missing 4 of the ingredients. Again, the waitress just stared at me and seemed exasperated when I asked for the ingredients it stated on the menu with the menu open in front of me. The third time, it was STILL missing chargrilled onions, red wine vinegarette, AND no baby greens. They completely took off the greens too. The manager was just as bad as the waitress, just stared at me when I told him it was missing 3 ingredients after the third time and did NOT offer to get me the ingredients or replace my meal with something else. After sitting at the table for well over an hour and having my meal remade WRONG three times with no apologies or trying to make it right on the waitress's/manager's end, I will never be visiting again.

The food was excellent the ambiance was almost festive. We had a great time even though we have no power at home.  I should say most of the restaurants in this area are doing limited menu's since the supply of food is slow in coming.  We only had a 20min wait and I started with an ice cold draft beer and ordered the fried calamari and bang-bang shrimp. They came out quickly with the drinks. The calamari was fresh crunchy and o'so good. The shrimp was a little spicy but not as much as my Son likes them. My son & I both ordered a full rack of baby back ribs , wife ordered the Asian salad and my DIL ordered fish and chips.  Everything started to arrive at the same time and the smell was intoxicating not to mention the enormous amount of food. We took our time since we are completely out of power. We met and talked to the table next to ours. We did manage to eat at least 90% of the ribs.

But the service is unfortunately consistently slow.... it doesn't matter what time of day, it's gonna take a while to get the food out of the kitchen. And your server will take forever to bring refills on your drinks and yes I'm still waiting for my ketchup. The training and the encouragement of the serving staff to follow-up and stay alert is lacking.... Came back for another visit  Used their preferred waitlist to make my reservations. When I got there, I was told even though I made reservations online it would be a 20 minute wait. I asked and was told that if I didn't make reservations, it would be a 45 minute wait.   Bottom line the 20 minute turn out to be 45 minutes anyway, same as people who didn't make reservations  Their baby back ribs are good so is the prime rib. With out them it's hard to justify putting up with the disarray that this restaurant allows....  There where 4 of us today 3 of us got our food correctly served, mine was wrong. Took 20 minutes for correct food to come out... everyone else was finishing eating. Server apologized manager never came over.... from the time we made reservations to the time we got our food and finished eating was almost 3hours management does not have a handle on how disarrayed service is, for example during the course of our meal at least 4 servers brought food to our table asking if we ordered what they were serving. Then had to go to the computer to figure out what table ordered what ever they were serving.

Now all of that would have been ok, except for the food. 1. A medium rare steak came out well done. When they remade it, it was rare and took 20 minutes to bring back out. 2. Another steak tasted like dirty grill. 3. Corn dog nuggets were so over cooked you could not bite into them. When remade they were much the same and they took so long, we just took them to go. 4.

7,Cee P.,"Philadelphia, PA",51,5,19.0,5.0,2017-11-11,"I'm in love with BJ's in Wesley Chapel/Lutz. In short, I've come here with my husband on 2 additional occasions, both at different times of the day than today and all visits were on different days of the week. I just have to ask -- how can a restaurant have the exact same chef back there 24/7?! Lol! The food is delicious and tasting fresh... consistently! For traditionalists, there are familiar dishes to order. However, for a large portion of the menu, the food is creative in concept and flavor -- so this is definitely a fun place for a true foody to enjoy exploring. BJ's has yet to disappoint. Drink options: From soft drinks to the hot or iced-caffeinated beverages, the selection is pretty traditional. Alcoholic, wine and beer? This is called a brewery for a reason... bottom and top shelf is available --however, you cannot possibly make it here to ONLY drink... it's super hard to do! If you are a beer-drinker, though... I recommend the cherry-chipotle wings, bone-in, complimentary to any choice of beer--Scrumptious! Ambience & Decor: Personable, but open. The decor gives off an authentic brewery/warehouse feel, yet the varying booth options allow for all party sizes to receive the pleasure of feeling private. You have the TV tuned in to all of the exciting games for sports-lovers. The music is at a reasonable volume, so it's great for socializing or holding small, informal meetings (they have free wifi). Appropriate for all. You won't find a BJ's mascot ready to fill balloons with helium and pass them out for quick pics with the babes, but BJ's a great place to bring your kids during the daytime and in the evenings. No there's not a jungle gym, but the piZookie dessert is powerful enough to bring joy to children of all ages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-lutz,3.6,3.43,3.43,,3.498

3,Joseph D.,"Atlanta, GA",97,236,107.0,4.0,2017-11-20,"For those not familiar with BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, it's a restaurant chain with locations all over the United States, including a number of locations throughout Florida. With the newly built outlets bringing in so many people, it's probably a smart move to put a restaurant in close proximity as well. Anyway, the place itself looks really well done. Definitely has a nice presentation, especially in the bar area, and there are TVs everywhere for those sitting in booths or tables. We went on a Monday night and there were a good number of people watching football. I do appreciate BJ's having craft beers not only from themselves but also from breweries around Florida. They also have options from other breweries from around the US like Stone, Ballast Point, etc. I decided to go with the Brew Crew beer flight and the IPAs included in that specific flight were just okay - I've definitely had better. But the hefe and the blonde ale were pretty good. For 6.50, the flights are very well priced, especially for 20 ounces of beer. As far as the food goes, if you do get an appetizer, the calamari is pretty solid. There are daily specials and they have half off pizza on Mondays. You can either get a large deep dish pizza or a tavern pizza for half off. I ended up going with BBQ chicken deep dish, and it was decent. It was originally $26 and I probably wouldn't get it for that much, but it's not bad when it's half off on Mondays. I may have to go with the tavern pizza next time.  I didn't get dessert, but everyone talks about getting the pizookie if you still have room after dinner. It definitely looks good, and I'd probably give it a shot next time. Service was pretty good - the beer did take a bit to come out, but food came out quick. Our waitress did to forget to bring some things that we requested, but she got it promptly once we reminded her.

The back wall of the bar area is a large chalkboard where they list the different beers and they change frequently so that you always have new options most times when you visit.
