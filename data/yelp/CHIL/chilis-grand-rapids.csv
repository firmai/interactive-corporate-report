Jerry W.,"Plymouth, MI",188,22,,5.0,8/26/2017,The service was great.  Thanks for the hard work Noah. Chilis never disappoints.  I love the triple dippers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Aaron T.,"Grand Rapids, MI",5,1,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Do not eat here if you want good food or value customer service. Me and my girlfriend decided to dine at this location for dinner. She ordered the Cajun Pasta. Once our food was delivered you could just see that the noodles were overcooked or just plain old. So we told our waitress who apologized and took it back to the kitchen. No problem. However, the waitress and the manager who came over were completely emotionless and genuinely seemed to not care at all that the food was terrible. I felt as if they treated it as a whoops, sorry, with a shoulder shrug. In the end we received no final apology or compensation of any sort.  Needless to say we won't be going to any Chili's locations anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Courtney S.,"Belmont, MI",22,61,12,3.0,2/18/2016,"It was alright. Service was decent enough. Food very mediocre. We actually really liked the chips and guac/salsa appetizer. I thought the guac was pretty good for a chain--looked fresh and tasted fresh. My husbands steak and my burger left a little to be desired. Not a lot of flavor and the prices were a little high. We might stop in again for drinks and an appetizer in the future and try something else to eat.  Restaurant itself was clean and updated. I didn't venture into the bathroom so I can't speak to that.  We only went here because of it's proximity to the movie theater, and we just went to BWW this past Saturday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Julie M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,3,,2.0,6/28/2015,"While our server was nice, it took almost 5 minutes before she shows up at the table. No water. 6 more minutes. Drink order. Still no water. Not sure if we were supposed to order from the new tablet on the table with a menu and games. Are they still using waitstaff?? We looked around and saw the table across from us had been waited on even after being seated AFTER us.  Flagged down the hostess and asked for water. She brought it.  Showed up with drinks (not my margarita or husband's beer) and took order.  4 minutes later brought beer... IN the bottle with no mug.  Was told bar could not make margarita frozen w/standard alcohol and if I wanted frozen-had to buy more expensive margarita. Ok.  Appetizer came and ASKED if we wanted plates. Really?  YES!! We eat off of PLATES.   Went to the bathroom. Dirty. Walking back heard the next table say ""oh you're finally going to bring us something"".  About 10 more minutes and no waitress. Very good frozen margarita arrives. 3 more minutes and food arrives. We have to ask for our 12 year old's order and a beer mug.  ""Uhh, oh, I'll go check the kitchen"". Returned. She says kitchen is backed up--read: she forgot to put the order in.  Food arrives almost 10 minutes later. Apologizes and comps his meal. The rest of us are all finished eating.  Nobody came to ask if our food was okay until after we had finished eating. No management on the floor.  Seriously. We only went here because I had a gift card. Annoyance is not worth $30 off a $60 bill.  Do. Not. Waste. Your. Time. Here.  I generously gave 2 stars because the food we actually GOT was good and hot, and though she was TERRIBLE, the waitress was polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
M M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,100,18,1.0,1/6/2016,The food is awful at this restraunt even with the new menu.  The ingredients are just not quality. The service is below average. I will not go here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Beth B.,"Kent City, MI",3,1,,2.0,8/15/2015,"Service was good, however ribs were very tough and the rice in the burrito was not cooked and hard.  Will not be back for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Ashley A.,"Rowlett, TX",8,11,8,1.0,6/9/2014,"Worst service ever! Waited for 30 minutes on our very simple lunch order, when it came one in our party wasn't served. It took 20 minutes longer for her food to arrive. When it arrived it was brought out by the manager who was incredibly rude and did nothing to try to apologize for the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Todd C.,"Comstock Park, MI",2,19,4,5.0,10/18/2015,always have great service and terrific food at the east beltline location.  our server was training and you couldnt tell.  try the fajitas!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Kendal M.,"Belmont, MI",0,3,1,1.0,8/29/2015,"Looked around Knapps Corner and most the restaurants had an hour wait, so we went to the nearby Chilis.  Half empty restaurant so we thought great no wait.  Took 20 minutes to get the appetizer, then another half hour for the entree.  Food was cold.  The manager (Kathy) made it right with no charge, but still a disappointing experience.  Because of Kathy...we will give 'em another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Karen V.,"Rockford, MI",0,2,,5.0,3/18/2015,Good food and service every time we visit the East Beltline location.  They change up their menu often and add new items.  I do miss the sweet chili boneless chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Joe V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,4,1,1.0,9/21/2013,"Poor service.  Poor service.  Poor service.  Not only that, my burger had a stale bun, we were never served out appetizer, and no drink refills for 45 minutes.  Also, the men's room was disgusting and a urinal was overflowing all over the floor.  Get back in the car and head to the one on 28th street. Much much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
Jay S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",52,207,34,3.0,6/9/2011,We went tonight and ended up sending our food back for a couple of reasons.  The waiter was very kind and understanding and made sure that the manager stopped by our table.  When our meals arrived the second time. they were perfect.  The manager was more than gracious and comped our meals.  We will be back again soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grand-rapids
