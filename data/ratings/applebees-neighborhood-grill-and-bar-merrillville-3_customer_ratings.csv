13,Tonia O.,"Brighton, MI",105,311,155.0,4.0,2013-01-03,"Super efficient, friendly, and fast service. I've only ordered carry-out /car side to go service, so I can't comment on any dine-in experiences.  For a decent meal, at a decent price, within a decent amount of time.....not a bad choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
10,Emma K.,"Chicago, IL",9,186,69.0,2.0,2014-02-28,"Not that I'm a big Applebee's fan anyways, but it can be an okay option when you are looking for something pretty quick and inexpensive.  I also appreciate that they have a 550 calories & under menu, but the overall experience was just disappointing. A lot of the 550 calorie & under options sounded delicious.  I went with the filet that came with an ""artichoke spread"" filled portabella and potatoes.  The plate looked very sad when it came out.  The steak was slightly overcooked and chewy, and the portabella was just filled with cut up artichokes.  Not the same thing as ""creamy artichoke spread"" as advertised. We sat in a booth next to the window, and I was absolutely freezing.  There was definitely a draft.  Our waitress was okay, but nobody was especially friendly here.  I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend commented on it when the hostess stared at us without saying a word on our way out. + 1 star for the pomegranate lemonade - favorite part of my meal! + 1 star for my boyfriend enjoying his chicken sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
14,Jennifer R.,"Merrillville, IN",0,7,,4.0,2014-04-27,"This was my first time using the To Go service, & I was very happy with Alex, who came out to my car when I was ready to go in & order!  Very sweet, & very patient with my 2 kids & I.  I ended up going in, & I'm glad because it took forever for the food to be done.  By the time I got home, everything was cold, & my dessert was missing.  Totally my fault, I was in a hurry to get my kids home, they were hungry & my 2 yr old was gearing up for a temper tantrum.  I called & was told they'll credit my debit card, or I can come back another time.  I went back the next day.  It was a long wait again, just for the small brownie, a tiny cup of chocolate sauce, & a tiny cup of ice cream.  2 days in a row, & a freakishly long wait for the To Go door.  2 weeks later, I go back with my kids & a friend, & we dine in this time.  Service was faster, & my only complaint is there was too much seasoning on my potatoes & veggies.  I had the Citrus Lime Sirloin & it was YUMMY!  Even with the extra seasoning.  My appetizer was the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, with tortilla chips.  SO GOOD!!  And I don't like artichoke's, so that's saying something!  Oh, & tips are encouraged for the To Go service.  They still wait on you, & answer your questions, just like if you were sitting down to eat.  Alex kept putting pressure on them to hurry in the kitchen, & in the end, he went & put everything in the bags himself, & brought it out to me.  So, yay for the servers, but the kitchen needs to pick up the pace, or get more help.  I wouldn't say that if it was a 1 time event, but it was 2ce, on different days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
6,Sean T.,"San Antonio, TX",104,252,255.0,1.0,2014-05-12,"Nah, never again steak was overdone, the portion size wasn't good and it looked very little according to.the ad.   Spinach over salted, potato?

12,Rene W.,"Radcliff, KY",0,1,4.0,1.0,2014-12-02,African American are not welcome here. Waitress Joanna will not attend to black customers and the manager says nothing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
7,Jonathan S.,"Lowell, IN",0,12,,1.0,2015-01-01,"This place was terrible tonight. From the time we got there to the time we left.  The host, Debo,  just stared at us and asked how many upon entrance, took us to our table and didn't say a single word on the way there.  The manager, Jarvis, was an extremely nice man, got our drinks for us after we sat there for a few minutes without being helped. He also took our order when he brought the drinks. He was by far the best part of our visit.  The server didn't even come to the table until our appetizer came out, nice lady but very inattentive. I won't mention her by name solely for the reason it looked like they were severely understaffed.  Food took far longer than it should have based on how many people were in the restaurant, and the fish was dripping grease.  I wasn't expecting much based on previous experiences, but this was just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
9,Steve C.,"Griffith, IN",56,11,,4.0,2015-09-20,"I have visited this location a few times and never had any problems.  The manager, Emmett, always goes out of his way to be friendly toward my family when we visit  and he even served our drinks to our table a couple of times. The staff is always friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
5,Tom R.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,94,10.0,4.0,2015-10-07,Let me preface my review by saying I hate Applebee's     I really do.  but that said the manager in this place Emmet is such a character and nice guy that it was a good dining experience. the food wasnt bad had a tasty 1/2 BLT.  Service was great the manager was even better!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,

I had to to send some fried green tomatoes back once brought out to me like that at another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
11,S J.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,6,,2.0,2016-06-24,"I usually love Applebee's, but NOT this one! My chicken dish was overcooked and dry. Our waiter was totally inattentive. My husband had to find me a bottle of ketchup (for my overcooked potatoes). The waiter passed our table once without stopping. My husband had to go find him to get our bill. This restaurant was a big disappointment. We will NOT be stopping here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,

3,Rob R.,"Valparaiso, IN",1,31,,4.0,2017-07-30,Had a good experience there recently. Food was great plenty to choose from and the waitress was awesome. She was very attentive and very helpful and cheerful which is a plus. Food was delivered quick and it was yummy but rather expensive for the portions. Will go back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
2,Maurice T.,"Merrillville, IN",5,32,35.0,4.0,2017-09-14,Applebee's' isn't a 5 star restaurant but it's the first place my wife and I went before dating. We occasionally go because it was the place we had our first meal together. It's a great place to have a quick lunch and the drinks are never watered down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
1,Blair M.,"San Antonio, TX",31,43,208.0,4.0,2017-09-29,"I stopped by on an early Friday evening with family, and, the food was pretty good! For an appetizer, we had spinach artichoke dip. For my entree, I had the mozzarella chicken caprese. It was yummy! The portion was just right, and the calories were low. Take advantage of their nice low calorie menu options, but, keep the sodium content in mind. The service was a bit slow, as there were not many servers. One thing that was confusing was that you can order appetizers on their table device, but, not entrees. I would honestly rather just complete my whole order in person, but, that's just a personal preference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
0,Dan P.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,25,2.0,4.0,2017-10-09,"Being in the area on business I had stopped by the Outback one night and asked if it was happy hour, the bar tender replied that happy hour is illegal in Indiana, I thought she was joking , so a few days later I was in this Applebees, I thought Applebees was happy hour all the time as in 2 for 1. So I asked if it was happy hour and again was told happy hour is illegal in Indiana, seriously its illegal, maybe thats why the Gary area is so depressing.   The food and service  at this Applebees was outstanding , restaurant and rest rooms nice and clean, happy hour law needs a repeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-merrillville-3,,,,,
