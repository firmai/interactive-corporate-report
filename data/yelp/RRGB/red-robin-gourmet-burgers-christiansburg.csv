Michela W.,"Richmond, VA",87,106,161,4.0,12/9/2017,"This is the usual Red Robin Burger action as is loved by my family, especially the kid.  We started coming here when she was younger because she could be loud and nobody cared.  They also have a good variety of options on the kids menu.  Now that she's older and almost out eating the kid's menu, we are thankful that a few of the options are bottomless.  J's favorite, the Mac and cheese, is Bottomless.  She just went through 2 servings.  We can cling to the optimism that is still a little girl and can eat off the kids menu for another day.   This particular Red Robin has a very attentive and friendly staff.  We have much experience dining at these, because it's a way to satisfy the kid.  This one's wait staff is particularly on top of it.  Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg
Mark B.,"Peterstown, WV",0,16,3,5.0,10/7/2017,"This restaurant whenever I eat there has some of the best customer service I've ever seen in a restaurant. Ate here with my girlfriend and she asked for no tomatoes on her burger, but there they were. Not a big deal because she just took them off.  The manager on duty came by to check on us and made sure we were happy with the  meal and apologized about the tomatoes. I've been to places where if you had a hair in your meal they didn't care. The waitress was awesome and made sure our drinks stayed filled, and she also apologized about the tomatoes and made sure we had a wonderful dining experience. Red Robin is a little pricey, so I don't eat here as often I'd like, but when I do it's always a great experience. Service with a smile and a little caring goes a long way with me. For a chain restaurant, I was impressed with the level of professionalism and work the folks put into making customers have a nice time. This visit helped make my day a little brighter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg
Lennore R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,179,38,5.0,10/2/2017,"I split the Buzz Mac'N'Cheese Tavern Double Burger that had mac'n'cheese, pepper jack cheese, tomato, and lettuce- we opted to get the spicy buffalo ranch sauce on the side because I'm one of few who hates ranch. For $6.99 with bottomless fries despite sharing, it was definitely a great deal! Condiments, napkins, and seasoning for fries were conveniently located on the table. We had a large group of 9 fit pretty comfortably at the round booth. The manager and hosts had a blast with our group - I was just my friend's +1 to the Tech v ODU game, so it was more of a reunion among alumni; nonetheless, I had a great experience. The waitress was on point but a tad snobby at the group. Regardless, she kept her composure and did her job.  The food was delicious and hot when it came out. They kept the fries refilled nonstop. The only complaint I have is a bit more mac'n'cheese on the burger, but I guess it was affordable for a reason. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. I see why this is one of their favorite spots to go to- affordable, quick, & (overall) friendly service~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg

Jeff D.,"Radford, VA",9,79,24,3.0,9/30/2017,"Red Robin is a typical chain restaurant, with decent food and mediocre service. Instead of bringing me a fresh refill, our waitress asked me to ""hold"" my straw while she refilled my glass. So, there I am holding a dripping sticky straw while I wait. Most places would have just brought me a fresh glass. On the other hand, when the kitchen messed up my GF's order, she wasted no time getting the issue fixed. Kudos there. The food was good: better than most chain restaurants, but not super amazing.

Kelly F.,"Kansas City, MO",43,83,59,3.0,1/2/2017,"I tried the new burger with mac n cheese. It was more like plain macaroni with some cheese sauce on the bun, not at all what I was expecting. The noodles were actually white and plain. The service was not great. My boyfriend went about 15 minutes without a refill. If it's cold out, don't sit next to a window because the draft is horrible. I asked to not sit near the door because of the cold and then was sat next to a window. Not the smartest choice she could've made since the place was almost empty but then again, I could've asked to sit somewhere else agin but shouldn't have to as my first request should've been clue enough that I don't like a draft. I guess I'm just a stickler for outstanding customer service. The people I was with loved their food and I usually do but decided to try that new burger. It's Red Robin.

We sat and waited for 40 minutes before a manager came. 20 minutes later our food came and it was not only cold but the cheese was congealed. Gross!

Josh C.,"Charleston, WV",0,1,,2.0,11/2/2015,"Went here two nights in a row because it was close by and I like a good burger. The first evening everything was ok. I ordered a med-rare burger and they got it pretty close which was good for me, and ordered some to-go items to munch on later. The burger did take much longer than I thought it would, and I had no idea that the salad I had substituted for my fries would be served as a literal side to my burger. Being a restaurant manager myself I can say that was a failing effort on the kitchen's speed and the bartender's communication with their guest. All that said, the burger was freshly cooked and pretty damn good.  On to the next day; I had just got off of my 10 hr shift and hadn't had a proper meal all day so I figured I'd order a burger and wings to-go. The phone rang 10-15 times before I had gotten an answer. Told the gentleman on the phone I wanted my burger as rare as you'll cook it, to which he replied, ""medium?"" Either he was uninformed or the bartender the previous shift didn't tell me that med-rare was not an option. He told me 15-20 min and didn't not give me a total for the bill. I arrived 20 min later and had to wait about 5 min for the food. Needless to say it was dead that night and the night prior. Once I got back with the food I looked at the ticket on the bag and the burger said ""no pink."" Of course it was well-done and I'll was quite pissed that I paid $15 for a well burger. Also did not receive the cole slaw even though it said it on the ticket. Moral of the story is that the food, after a long wait for it is not bad, but the overall pace and service are almost unbearably bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg?start=20

I immediately reordered more fries anticipating a wait and I was right, 30 minutes later received them along with my check.

Jeremiah F.,"Aurora, IL",43,138,86,4.0,9/26/2013,"I've been here several times with family and friends. I'm even a member of their Red Robin Club, whatever it's called. The deals I get through the club are fairly decent so when we're looking to save a little money and have a good burger we head out this way with a coupon or two. Red Robin has a family-friendly atmosphere and as with all chains you know exactly what to expect when you eat there. The service is friendly and the food is always tasty. Having recently changed my eating habits I'm a little sad there's not a bottomless option of something else for me that's not potatoes but that's all on me, not on them.  (EDIT: A member of the Red Robin team has informed me that they DO have other bottomless things that fit into my new way of eating perfectly! I'm looking forward to going again and enjoying one of the options that she lists below in her response!) They're usually happy to substitute a salad for the fries, for which I'm grateful. One of their best deals is the bottomless root beer float. If you like a good root beer float, this one never ends! This is one of the few chain restaurants of which I'm a fan.

Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,1.0,10/13/2011,"My husband & I came to Red Robin on a slow Monday night to grab some food before we had to go back to work the next day.  The parking lot was pretty empty and that was fine with me as we were both on the hungry side.  We were greeted and taken to the back corner to a booth by the hostess. Brian was server. He took our orders and moved on to the couple behind us to take their order.  He came back after 5 minutes to ask us if he took our order yet because he ""couldn't remember."" This was a bit alarming since he just took it a few minutes ago.  We sat and enjoyed chatting about things until we noticed quite some time had passed. The restaurant had maybe 10 people in it and the couple behind us got their burgers and food before we even got our salad & wraps.  I began to get irritated that perhaps Brian 'did' forget our order. He finally brought us our food after 35 minutes. I had a soda and needed a refill. I had set it on the edge so he could see and he asked if we needed anything. My husband politely asked him if I could have a refill on my empty soda.  The ironic part is he was super-hero fast with bringing our bill in which he charged for full Caesar salad when I had asked for side. It's a minor detail but I can never finish a full size salad and it just shows he did not listen to any detail.  Overall, I had thought it'd be another chain of Red Robin but this one took the cake for being the worst I've ever stepped in.

Bobbie Jo L.,"Bluefield, WV",2,17,7,5.0,2/23/2011,"This was our first time eating at this restaurant in christiansburg, we usually eat at the one in Roanoke but we weren't disappointed! In fact our experience here just made me love this chain even more! We ate there last night. 3 adults (one of our kids is 15), and 4 children (ages 8-10). The total bill for 7 of us came to $ 40 and some change.  They not only happily GIVE a military discount but if you are in uniform, your meal is free. We ate here to celebrate when my husband came home from Iraq, literally as soon as he got off the plane so he was still in uniform and they gave him his meal for free.  This restaurant chain had never disappointed with it's cleanliness, charming atmosphere, and impeccable service or price. The greatest thing about Red Robin for bigger families is their bottomless meals! Seriously as a mother of 5, this concept is un-heard of!!! They have a childrens menu where the kids can color it and circle what they want to eat (takes the pain out of offering for 4 smaller kids), bring out cups with lids, AND (one of the kids just noticed last night) that they have a game of I spy on the cups to keep the kids busy!!! Kudos to the person who thought of that!! Instead of listening to who was touching who and who was being mean we heard, ""cool!!!"" While the game occupied them and opened them up to looking around the restaurant at all the neat stuff they have on the walls. Before we knew it.....DING....food was served. When you first walk in they have a tv in the floor! My kids are obsessed with standing on it and before we know it, we are being seated without having to hear the typical ""we're hungry"" that parents usually hear while standing in line to be seated. And as my son informed me, they have a tv in the boys bathroom...so be prepared for your kid to keep having to go to the bathroom, lol. Two of my kids ordered the cheese pizza, one ordered the cheeseburger, and the other ordered the mac and cheese. All but one got the steak fries and the other got apple slices. ALL BOTTOMLESS! If you haven't experienced this yet, everything that the kids ordered....they could have as much as they wanted for no extra charge! My son ended up getting a second cheeseburger and the other a second pizza. You absolutely can not beat that especially for larger families when your kids are going through a growth spurt and one portion isn't quite filling. They also have bottomless drinks, I just dont remember which ones but the different flavored Iced Teas were on there and they are good!!!  They also serve mixed drinks which is very nice for Mom and Dad! While we were sitting there eating, the Manager came around and stopped at every table to personally check on the customers needs. He stopped at our table, joked around with the kids and continuously asked if we needed anything and how our service was. That was very nice and made us feel like our every need was met. I watched the manager walk around to every table to check on his customers, it kind of made us feel like we were part of the Red Robin family!  Excellent parking, smoke-free environment, super friendly staff, great food, great prices, fun atmosphere, comfortable dining experience, and not just kid-friendly....KID WELCOMING without the adults feeling like it's a kids restaurant. I can't say enough good things about Red Robin, and have not one bad thing to say and we've had the RR EXPERIENCE about 4 times in two different locations.  And they also do sing Happy Birthday and I think you get a complimentary desert and they have a RR online club for deals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg?start=20

Good burgers, good fish and chips.  My kids like the chicken fingers.  They have some very unique burger recipes so experiment if you can dig up the cash to eat here. The atmosphere is typically kitchy semi-upscale American fast food with a somewhat unique take, like a nicer version of something from Office Space. But the bad part is the prices jumped way up a while ago.  I don't expect to pay over $50 for two burgers, two kids dinners and one beer with milk for the kids and a soft drink for the wife.  I think we actually it $55.  That's no way to charge for a family of four.
