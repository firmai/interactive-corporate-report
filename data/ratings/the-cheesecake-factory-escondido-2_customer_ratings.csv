249,Carmen V.,"San Jose, CA",1510,2392,10401.0,3.0,2013-11-26,"From an inauguration day you would expect at least some free samples and an abundance of smiles...In lieu of that, what I got was a long line, a 45 minute wait, some attitude like 'don't bother too much as there are too many others'. When I asked about the samples the lady at the entrance said that she did not know if they were giving or no. Hum, already a bad first impression. I have been waiting and monitoring the inauguration day and escaped from work during lunch break to take a look and eat something. I could not wait that long and was disappointed with the lack of generosity toward new customers (I love their food at least from other locations).  Other than not being impressed by the customer service, I was really happy to see this new addendum to the North County mall, prime location, all new, pretty, shiny. Cakes look awesome and the restaurant look big yet not massive. I will comment another day about the food. And please, do not promote yourselves that much on the Facebook page about the inauguration day when you don't even have a little something to give (or maybe was for the 5 first customers or so?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=240,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

First thing we were told was that they ran out of white rice, and we came in right when they opened, and we saw the managers conferencing about this oversight.  The TVs in the bar area were on paid programming for a good half hour before they were changed to a game that was going on. I know I'm not there to watch tv, but when I look over and am watching KitchenAid and T25 ads, I don't feel as comfortable as I am when a game's on.  They also had a promotion going on in the lobby area of purchasing a gift card and getting a voucher. My wife and I tried to explain this to our server multiple times but she wasn't sure what we were talking about.  So everything is still getting worked out.

Better service, better food and NICER staff! This was the WORST service ever! CONS: HORRIBLE SERVICE, Long waits, SLOWEST service known to man (ISNT THERE A TIME FRAME IN WHICH TO PROVIDE WATER AT THE VERY LEAST!?), little knowledge of menu (where the f is the training? Who runs this circus?)  PROS: Food was good. They text you when your table is ready so you're free to walk the mall. And the guys and the front counter are nice (should this even be a pro?) The wait was 1 1/2 hrs to start but they take your number to text you when your table is ready so that A plus I suppose. It seems like they hired people that have ZERO experience for the grand opening. It literally took 20 min for us to even get water. FUCKING WATER!!!!! They told us our table was ready, started getting the menus ready but then they girls talked for 5 min while we were standing there waiting to follow them to our table. Once seated we began to ask for water before being rudely cut off and rudely being told ""I'll be right back"" (right back took at LEAST 10 minutes). She could have at least faked a cheesy smile, but no just a storm off(...b!tch) We had our orders ready by the time she came back.  We ordered appetizers,drinks, main dishes and waters.  13 min later our water comes! During this time I asked for waters and was told to please hold while she places our food orders. (Ok? No problem, I know you have to go to the mountains and gather fresh stream water or the alternative and perform a rain dance)I see her what seems to be being trained on HOW to use her computer (YAY!) WATER PLEASE WE'RE F'ing DYING! She brings waters finally but  instead of kids water she brings big mugs for a 5 and 2 year old( wouldnt common sense say Kids cups? ) I had to ask a server walking by to bring us cups since we were being ignored.  Then the waitress got our drink orders wrong. Then the straws we asked for never came. From the time we sat down to the time our food came was a little over 1 HOUR! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  She just SUCKED! DEAR GOD SHE SUCKED and I know shitty waiters!

As per usual, I let the server know and she came back with a manager who then helped me make my dinner choice.

When I was called the host staff was very friendly and quick with getting me seated in a good amount of time. Literally right after being sat, the server was there taking drink orders and brining bread. She was very friendly and knew the menu. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo as well as the Parmesan bread. The food was beyond amazing. Compared to my fettuccini from fashion valley, this one tasted freshly made. The Parmesan bread was to die for, like beyond amazing! Not only did the servers check on me, but the host staff did as well which was nice! They came by every so often asking if everything was okay and if I needed drink refills.

The only other CCF I've been to in San Diego is the one in Fashion Vally Mall. I'm so glad that there is one in North County SD! (: I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in their dining service (test run for their staff prior to opening). JBH and I sat at the bar for our dinner. Our server, I believe his name was David. He had told me that it's his first time as a bartender and that he used to work at the CCF in FV! He was very friendly and very good at explaining the menu.  To start, we got the nachos with spicy chicken... beware.. this thing is HUGE. No, correction it was GIGANTIC. We ate a lot of it, but still had some left. We though we saved enough room for our dinner entrees, but obviously we were wrong. Haha. We literally ate 2 bites of our entree and had the rest boxed up. We got the California cheesesteak sandwich and the wasabi ahi over brown rice. Both dishes were really good! The meat in the cheesesteak was thin and tender. Very delicious. The wasabi ahi was also good, nothing bad about it. Although it tasted a lot better when we were at the restaurant vs. taking it home and reheating it. I don't recommend getting the fish to-go. especially since it is cooked medium rare.  Lastly, dessert!!! We got the red velvet cheesecake. YUM. It's probably one of my favorite cheesecakes at the CCF. They were featuring the s'mores cheesecake and I rally wanted to try that one, but we barely had room for the one we ordered.

There seems to be quite a bit of staff on hand, becuase it was later seemed like some were congregating in throngs where we couldn't get through until the server made his way through and they were all very friendly. The server told us the special of the day, grilled salmon on a bed of rice, brown or white with some type of coconut sauce. That sounded good to me and not too heavy, my husband opted for the cajun pasta. My dinner was exceptionally delicious, not too heavy on the coconut taste or sauce as a matter of fact my husband kept coming back for more after insisting he taste it. His was pretty good too but I loved mine. We both had decided to only eat 1/2 or less of our dinner so we could have dessert, which we did. We opted for the Apple Crumb cheesecake and it was delish.

We shopped around the mall and our table was ready right at the 2 hr mark which we were prepared for so we didn't mind.  We started with ahi tartare and fried calamari. Both dishes were DELICIOUS! The ahi was more fresh than ahi we've had in Maui & the calamari was crispy on the outside but juicy and tender on the inside and came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which were both great. For dinner, my husband had the southern fried catfish, I had the cajun jambalaya pasta with shrimp and my teenage daughter had the four cheese pasta. My two younger daughters ordered pasta from the kids menu and the portions were quite large for kids portions. My dish was good but I will most likely order a different dish next time, as it was a little bland for my taste. The fried catfish was delicious, moist and came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn. My daughter said her pasta was good but I did not try it. We were all stuffed so we ordered cheesecake to go. We had the smores cheesecake, strawberry, red velvet and vanilla which were all ok in my opinion.

I'd also like to say that the reason my review is 3 stars is the wait. I was so excited to get to try this new location for my mother-in-law's birthday. We went here on a Thursday night so it shouldn't have been too crazy although they just opened recently and most everyone that I know in North County is more than happy that they're open. The waitress that we had was incredibly nice and professional with her service. However, every step of the process took 20 minutes or more. We waited to get in for more than 20 minutes which is expected for Cheesecake Factory and just something that you should accept if you're going to go here. However, from the time we were seated to the end process took 2 hours and 10 minutes. I'm going to attribute this to the fact that the restaurant just opened and I plan on going back in the future to give it another try.  The food was good as always. I got the chicken and biscuits. The manager came over and kindly expressed that they were out of the gravy and were willing to make a different type of gravy for it. I was okay with that and the substitute gravy was delicious. The only thing that I would change is that I wished there was more gravy and I'm not one of those smother it w/ gravy kind of girls. My mother in law got the crispy chicken costoletta which was awesome! I plan on getting it next time I go. My husband got the cajun chicken littles which he loves and orders practically every time that we go here. My father-in-law got a chicken Caesar salad which he appeared to enjoy. 3 of us had cheesecake (2 had the peppermint one and I had the tiramisu cheesecake). My father-in-law had carrot cake which he loved.  I wish that I could give this location a better review because their staff were professional and their food was good. However, with the time at the table I just couldn't give them 4 stars.

After about two hours of shopping, we got hungry and wanted to have a sit down place to eat and not at the food court. It was either this place or BJ's so we came here. It's been awhile since we've been to the Cheesecake Factory (usually go to the one in Fashion Valley) and we're usually not very happy with the service or the food but decided to give this place a try (again).  We put our names in and they said it was a half hour wait, so they offered to text us when our table was ready. We went off wandering in the stores and got a text just like they said and were seated immediately. VERY COOL!  It was Friday and we were in the mood to drink so I got the pomegranate margarita (blended) and my husband got the margarita on the rocks. They were huge! They were served in large glasses but that was why it was $14 for one drink.  To start, we ordered the crab cakes for appetizers and that was really good. Better than I expected.  They were out of my usual chicken and biscuits so I ended up getting the fried chicken salad served on kale, yay! I love kale! My husband got the cuban sandwich with the sweet potato fries. There were a lot of food on our plates, not to mention between the bread and the crab cakes for appetizers, we were getting pretty full. So we opted to pack the rest of our food to go and ordered cheesecake to go as well. I got the mango key lime cheesecake and my husband got the caramel turtle cheesecake. We decided to enjoy it later that night while watching a movie at home.  Service was great and the food was great. It goes to show you that not all chains are the exact same experience.

So anyway we get seated, and our waiter was just the best. I never got his name, but let's just call him pony tail guy. Pony tail guy was wonderful and was always on top of our refills and always made sure we were alright. He was an absolutely fantastic waiter and I hope someone in management sees this and gives him the credit he deserves.  I ordered a margherita pizza which came out with no tomatoes. None, at all. It was just cheese bread with some basil. I was so embarrassed to send it back because I usually don't like to fuss about my food but I did. Pony tail guy was so nice about it and made sure I was taken care of.  The man who came out and apologized for the pizza being poorly made was also very nice and actually made me laugh about the whole thing. He was also surprised that there was no tomato on the pizza. Instead of it being remade, I just ordered a slice of cheesecake which was lovely, and I left feeling sad about the food and long wait but happy with the staff.

In general, the wait staff has been great.  zero complaints.  We've already picked a couple favorites and try to chat with them if they have time!  We've learned not to have any expectations when putting our names in.  They don't do reservations, so you never know how long you might have to wait :( The food is great.  Top notch. HH appetizers are really well done and you get a great deal for your $.  They do have an excessively large menu, but no one I've been with has had complaints.  The table bread is surprisingly sweet, but don't fill up on it!  I won't speak on the Cheesecake: I've heard it's great but actually haven't tried it myself!

We went on a Thursday night where it wasn't so busy but there was still a wait of 50mins, as we were told by the guy who was adding us to the wait list. He asked us if we preferred sitting inside, outside, or had no preference and the boyfriend said ""inside because last time we were outside it was pretty bad"". Haha! I'm pretty sure that stung a little for the host (maybe he saw the yelp reviews?). So we gave him one of our cell phone numbers and proceeded to walk around and window shop in the mall. Not even 30mins of waiting time and we already got our text to come back and get seated. Wow! We walked back to Cheesecake Factory and was seated almost instantly. Chris E., according to our bill, was our server and man was it a breath of fresh air. We had EXCELLENT service! Once we were seated we were able to get our drinks and appetizer (no bread if we order an appetizer?) within about 15mins which is pretty fast. Our sever came back numerous times and was really attentive. Food of course was still delicious. I gotta hand it to the chefs inside for always bringing out quality food in a quick and timely fashion. The bartender was also pretty good that night making our three drinks (boyfriend's 2nd mojito was definitely amped up a little on the rum and was a nice addition). Got our bill, gave our server a hefty tip (unlike our last time...) and was out there in no time rubbing our full bellies and strolling to the car. Thank you for a better service!  I only added 1 more star because I feel that service can be a hit or miss depending on how busy the place gets, and maybe on who serves you. If I had excellent service all the time I'd totally give my 4.5 stars but because of the ranging service I'm giving this place 3-ish stars.

She called in advance and tried to make reservations for a party of 8, but she was told that it was ""not a large enough"" party to reserve for.  They did however, encourage for the whole party to walk in because they can ""easily accommodate"" the party.  We arrive and end up waiting ONE HOUR for a table.  I am 7 months pregnant, and that was just very miserable to have to wait that long.  When we were finally seated, they gave us complimentary appetizers of wontons, avocado eggrolls, and calamari.  We enjoyed them greatly!  Along with our entrees. I had my usual Miso Salmon that I never fail to order at this restaurant.  Our dining experience with our food was amazing as usual but does not entirely make up for the fact that we always have to wait this long whenever we dine as a group. Me & my friends love this place for their food, & it's too bad a good food experience can't be shared with each other without an ungodly wait. I would love to come here for my birthday, but this business is not group-friendly. This is not the first i have had a long wait experience despite attempts to make a reservation. Like I said, I really wish they would change their reservation policy.  It is unreasonable. They did not find us large enough to reserve seats for in advance BUT found us large enough to automatically charge gratuity.

The rumors that their menu items sport some of the highest caloric counts in the country. Well, I had a light lunch there with my parents this past Sunday and my anxiety was tempered when I encountered a menu that was devoid of caloric information -- I didn't have to stare at an actual calorie number that would discourage me from ordering what I wanted. Thank goodness! My sister and I decided to take full advantage of their bar; I decided on a glass of the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. It was lovely, showcasing light notes of citrus. There's nothing I enjoy more on a late Sunday morning breakfast/brunch than a glass of wine.   The family shared an order of the nachos to whet the appetites. I tried to be good, only having a few controlled bites. The nachos were actually done quite well. The chips tasted as if they were made from scratch, and the sauce, cheese, and other toppings melded together quite well. Superior taste. I tried to play it relatively good and avoided what I thought would be too heavy. I opted for the Chicken Salad Sandwich and asked for a green salad in lieu of the french fries that come with it. The sandwich was stellar. It was very well-balanced, the chicken not being bathed in too much mayonnaise. The bread was perfectly toasted and had a lovely flavor.  My mom had a spicy chicken sandwich. I commandeered it for a second and took a bite; it had a lovely kick to it! Everyone else at the table seemed to be genuinely pleased with their choices, too! I avoided dessert, but mom and dad walked out with cheesecake for later.  Yeah, this is a chain, but it's darn good.

The chicken was very juicy and the sauce was great. I asked our server for some extra sauce and it took a while to come (she said they make it from scratch for each order) but it was worth the wait! Nothing special about the potatoes, and the carrots weren't bad. They were cooked, but still had a little crunch to them which I like a lot. -Skinny Long Island Iced Tea: This was great! It wasn't an overwhelming strong hit, but you can tell it packed a punch. -Passion Fruit Mojito: I don't like overly sweet drinks, so this one was just okay for me. My friend loved it though.

Would have been nice to have been told this 45 minutes ago or when we first put our name in.  What restaurant doesn't do reservations for larger parties????  They might want to rethink that so they don't have more angry customers waiting FOREVER for a table.  All in all I would not come back due to poor planning on their part.  Being in the restaurant business, customer service is the key for repeat customers, otherwise they will be loosing a lot of business to BJ's just across the way!!!  Wish we would have gone there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.568,2.76

It was Sunday and not really busy day we placed our order, after 40 minutes the server came back saying sorry guys I forgot to send your order to the kitchen and it is going to take 10 more minute and we put your order as the priority! It takes them 20 minutes and then they brought each order in 5 minute intervals and server stating she doesn't have enough hand, what a dumb excuse! Is it priority! After we were done server brought the bill and she just remembered we mentioned it is my mom birthday so she brought a slice of cake and brought us another check! It takes her forever to bring the boxes so we have to ask another server for boxes! Unfortunately here they have poor customer service and respect for their guests! Managements needs to do more training for the servers, I don't mind waiting for my order but this not a reasonable excuse that the server forgot to send the order to kitchen on a slow working day! I should mention that the manager is really passive we brought up the problem to him and he was asking what should I do , they need stronger management so problem solved on the table since he knew the problem from the beginning.

We waited over 2 hours to be seated outside at night in the cold with a three year old. When asked to move inside, we waited again and never actually got sat inside. They forgot our salads. When the food came it , the weather was so cold that it turned cold very quickly. When speaking with the Manager, Rebecca, regarding our experience all she said was she would address the hostess.

Our server Brenna was PHENOMINAL!! She was very knowledgeable of the menu, had great recommendations and was super attentive. It really does make a difference when you ask for lemons in your water, and they bring you a small cup with a handful of cut lemons. Or... before you even have to mention extra napkins, they are already placed at the end of the table. I don't think there was a moment when any of our drinks went past half empty.  Hopefully the rest of The Cheesecake Factory employees take note of Brenna's outstanding work ethic.

Wouldn't have been a big deal if the lantern things would have heated the patio, or if we'd brought sweatshirts, but we got to shivering within about 20 minutes.  Our waitress was very attentive and got us an order of nachos while we looked over the menu for our main meal. The nachos were pretty good at first but as they cooled they got bland and gross. Our meal took 40 minutes to arrive. And my plate was completely wrong. Another 20 minutes and my wife was done eating and they brought out my meal - on a plate. Not in a to go box as was asked for. Then shortly before we left a manager came over to us and apologized and walked away. No offer of a discount, or a free meal, or a pick a desert on us free. Nothin'. Just, ""hey we're really sorry, we dont know what happened...""  I've had poor dining experiences before. In fact I seem to be cursed to always be the guy whose order is forgotten or screwed up.

Now, I can shop Til I drop at my second home - Nordys, and then veg out over a decent meal closer to home. I love Fashion Valley and The Shops at Mission Viejo, but there's something sweet about being close to that place we call home. My first encounter here was for take-out. The service was not very good. When I arrived at the checkout counter, there were three servers who appeared to be very young. They were arguing over what table ordered a ""smoothie"". One of the young ladies was extremely upset and combative because she was concerned that when she cashed out at the end if the night, that her receipts, etc would not reconcile. This, all while I'm standing there waiting to be helped; mind you, all three of them made eye contact with me several times, yet, none bothered to acknowledge me. Finally, someone asked me if I wanted to place an order. I explained that I was there to pick up an order. Apparently this did not register because I was asked the same question several times - twice by the same young lady who was clearly upset over the receipts and smoothie in question. Oddly, she was the same one I saw carrying my order to the checkout counter 10 minutes prior. Eventually, a young man appeared from his conversation on the opposite end of the counter to apologize and assist me. It was all quite dreadful. I sure hope this location steps it's service up and fast. On a positive note, I noted that my order was ready in 15 minutes as promised over the phone. My order came complete with utensils, bread and butter; just as if I were dining in - nice. I ordered the turkey club with avocado. What's a club without avocado? Boy was it good. Unfortunately, the French fries were cold.  Oh well, I still love the CKF; it will always hold a special place in my heart. That said, at some point I'm sure I'll give this location another try.

574,Jordan Z.,"San Diego, CA",13,54,14.0,3.0,2014-02-24,"I really want to love this place, because I heard so my hype about it, I love cheesecake, and had wanted to come here for such a long time, and finally just went here for the first time in December, and then again last night, but found myself disappointed for different reasons both times.   I understand because it just opened a few months ago that it is very popular and busy, and that the servers are still learning.  However, with that said.... My first time there we experienced great service.  Our server was friendly and sweet (wish I could remember her name, but we sat in her section near the bathrooms).  I ordered the sun-dried tomato alfredo pasta and was extremely disappointed with how absolutely bland in flavor it was.  I seriously have never had such terrible pasta.  I can make WAY better pasta at home.  Luckily, their cheesecake makes up for it, but I expected far better flavor for the price. My second experience was at the self-seating bar area (not the bar itself, but the tall, circular tables next to the bar) and I believe our server was named Krystal.  We ordered waters (which our server was probably initially irritated about because she wanted to make money off of expensive bar drinks, but we were just not in the mood for alcohol this time).  She brought us the waters and bread, but we still had no menus and no silverware.  We ask her for menus and had all of about a minute or so to look over them before she returns she asks us what we want to eat.  The menu is HUGE, what makes you think we are ready to order?  We asked her to bring us silverware, so we can actually spread butter on the bread she brought us, which takes all of about a minute or two, and when she returns with the silverware, she asks us again if we are ready.  The entire experience from that point on just felt rushed and stressful.  It seemed like our server wanted to get us in and out so she could get more customers in and make more money.  After ordering and getting our food, our hummus and pita bread was delicious, but our mozzarella triangles and spinach and artichoke dip came out luke-warm.  We were so intimidated by our server that we felt uncomfortable asking her to re-heat the food, but we mustered up the confidence to do so anyways.  As a server, you shouldn't be so aggressive that you scare your customers out of what they want.  Later on in the evening, as we are finishing up our meals, she complains to us about other customers she dealt with that night which came off as very unprofessional.  We came here for an enjoyable experience, not to listen to our server complain about her job and her four tables.  I've worked in the service industry before for many years, so I have empathy for servers when they get busy, but four tables is not that many.  Clearly, we weren't the only people dissatisfied with our server that night, because the other customers left her a note basically telling her the service sucked.  The entire evening was just awkward and unpleasant, and my boyfriend and I felt relieved to get out of there.  I'm not saying that our server should necessarily be fired, but she needs some serious training in work ethic and customer service.  A change in attitude can make all the difference, and trust me, she needs some help.  Will request my friend and old co-worker David as our server next time.  She could definitely learn a thing or two about service from him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.668,2.88

We weren't greeted by our server for about 15 minutes. She did not apologize for the delay. Took our drink order and I told her what we wanted for an appetizer. Received our appetizer and ordered our lunch. While waiting I asked for bread. After about 10 minutes the server said the bread was baking and would be out soon. She mentioned that she was having a tough day. Because her first table left her a religious pamphlet for a tip. And she was catholic so what were they thinking. Our food came out and our order was wrong. The girl that brought us our food took it back to be corrected. Tina said she ordered the food wrong. She checked on us once after getting the correct order. And we only sawing her waiting on others after that. We both were out of drinks, she would see us looking at her but never came back. About 30 minutes later I saw her checking out. Looking at her receipts and then she left (I guess her shift was over). We were'nt offered anything else (drinks, dessert-which we mentioned we wanted cheesecake). She just left. We at that point could have left (our $48 bill unpaid) and no one would have known anything different. I flagged down another server and she said she would get the server who was taking care of the tables behind us to help us. We told the new server about what was happening, that we had been abandoned and ignored. He didn't apologize. Just said he was a trainer and would coach her on the situation. I asked him if there was a way our tip could go to him. Because we were so disappointed in the service we had gotten. He said no. He took our cheesecake order and 10 minutes later we received our dessert. Luckily we had saved our spoons as we weren't offered silverware. We both were still out of drinks. I went up to the bar and got 2 glasses of water. The cheesecake slices were large so we wanted to-go containers. My daughter went up to the to-go/cheesecake area and got containers. We then took our check up to the same counter to pay our bill. As Michael didn't come back. He then saw us and came up to the counter and said he would process our bill. I was disappointed that I felt like I gave Michael the chance to make a bad situation better. And he didn't take advantage of that opportunity. As a side note I felt like the bartenders could see we were being neglected and didn't extend any help.

570,Michael S.,"Concord, CA",212,59,23.0,1.0,2014-03-08,"Don't believe the hype this place sucks. I don't know why this place is so popular but I have been here multiple times and each time i have had a bad experience.  The first time I came it was my friends birthday and before we could be seated we had to wait an hour and walk around the mall just to be seated outside in the cold winter night. When the waitress came with our food she spilled some fries on my wife and ruined her dress, the manager was quick about coming over to apologize and he seemed sincere. They brought over some more fries of course but i really didnt think that it was enough considering the fact that my wifes dress was ruined to the point she had to replace it. The burger I had was nothing special and really not worth 18 dollars, for four people the bill came out to 80$ and when I asked the waitress for a birthday song for my friend I really thought they were gonna bring at at least the birthday girl a slice of cake, but no they did not, after about 20 minutes of stalling they finally came and started singing but all they brought was some whip cream on a plate, considering our bill was 80$ and the fact that they had spilled fries on one of their guest you would think they could at the very least give the birthday girl a slice of cake.  Of course I understand that they are a business but even our local Denny's will give someone some came on their birthday, I was a little offended by the whip cream, if I knew they were gonna be stingy on the cake I would have been OK paying but they didn't even ask, and its not like we had already said no to desert, they just honestly didn't care about us. My second visit was with just my wife and we went in hopes that the place would redeem itself and live up to its popularity. It did not. It was crowded as usual and again we waited around an hour to be seated and again we were seated outside, luckily it was lunch time so it wasn't too cold. they were slow with everything and our waiter spent too much time handling a certain table with girls his age, I did not leave a tip. Again the food was mediocre and yet still we paid around 40$, I really don't mind the prices its just if I'm going to pay twice as much what I would at Dennys then I want at least twice the quality service and food. On this occasion I would take a Denny's cheeseburger over theirs any day. Our third trip was just as mediocre, although not a horrible experience we still had to wait the usual hour just to be seated outside for the third time. We both tried something different and were both unimpressed. Although our waitress actually paid attention to us this time the quality of the food just isn't worth the price, I really really don't understand what it is people love about this place. Yes I did try the cheesecake and yes it was good but not 7 dollars a slice good. I will not be going back to the cheescake factory for a very long time if at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5000000000000004,3.0000000000000004
551,Jules K.,"Escondido, CA",1,13,6.0,2.0,2014-03-08,"So I went with my friend to go eat some brunch today and our server was Alyssa. She was okay at first then she forgot our straws that we asked for and our bread that we asked for. 15 minutes later she comes back with the straws and tells us that our bread is baking, when clearly we see other servers bringing white bread to their tables. We had to ask another server for bread which he did bring and was very polite. After she forgot our straws and bread I was a little upset, but didn't make a big deal because I figured she was new because she didn't even know the menu. My friend ordered a salmon lunch special and she asked her what kind of rice she wanted with it when it doesn't even come with rice and then she never once came and asked how our food was. Now we're still pretty understandable at this point because we are servers as well and we understand servers forget things every now and then. However, I got upset when she passed our table on to a busser and was talking about us with her other coworkers. We could obviously tell she was complaining about us and talking bad about us.. There were 3 girls standing just pointing and staring at us. I felt very disrespected when a busser got us boxes and closed us out. Isn't that a servers job? I mean she was only on a 4 table rotation, well 3 since she gave up on us. I just felt that it was very unprofessional to give up on a table, if a table is upset you fix it, not run away and have a busser handle it when it's not even his job. In conclusion, the food was good and the workers were friendly and nice, but this girl has to go. She is rude and on top of it all she had a big hickey on her neck about a size of a golf ball. How unprofessional! I would definitely go back here but I will never ever sit in her section again.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory for giving you 2 stars but it really bugged me how she handled us just because we were young.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7280000000000006,3.0400000000000005
195,Fiona M.,"San Diego, CA",103,171,117.0,2.0,2014-03-09,"Ok, who designed this place and WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????  Dining out is something I do when I want to relax and spend quality time with my daughter. When I want to comfortably sit across a table and have a real conversation with my tween. When I don't want to have to stress about preparing the meal, serving the meal, and cleaning the meal. Summary...EATING OUT SHOULD BE RELAXING!  I am giving two stars for the decent food and the location staff who really tried to keep us happy with the ridiculous conditions they have to work with.  For example...Maximum capacity of the place is 300 people. 300 PEOPLE in one restaurant and here is what you have got... 1.) A  TINY WOMEN'S RESTROOM with only 3 stalls. Ummm...are you kidding me? The restroom is smaller than a standard storage unit! Plus, have they completely failed to consider the SUV sized strollers Mom's are driving these days? IDK how even ONE stroller is going to fit in this bathroom...was there even a changing table? Reflecting back, I don't recall seeing a changing table.  2.) ONE REGISTER. There is ONE REGISTER for the staff to work with. ONE REGISTER for 300 guests?  3.) VERY VERY VERY LIMITED seating for waiting guests. (I suppose they expect you to stroll the mall and wait for your, ""table ready"" text message.) Alas, have they not considered how bad the cellular reception is in the mall?  4.) THE PATIO. This was the icing on the cake. We waited 25 min to be seated in the blaring hot sun on the patio.All of the umbrellas and awnings were covering everything but the seating. (Of course the umbrellas were unable to be adjusted or moved.) We had to ask for extra napkins and a JUG of water because the table was too hot to touch and we needed constant hydration. After 10min my daughter had a sunburn, we were unable to rest our arms on the table and we had consumed the entire JUG of water.   MANAGEMENT! ARE YOU LISTENING? IT IS MARCH and TOO HOT FOR YOUR PATIO! Your restaurant is in ESCONDIDO! Come July, August and September, your patio is going to be useless unless you consider some better shade coverage and even cooling misters.  So, the staff really tried, the food was decent. I appreciated the SKINNY menu. BUT FOR GAWD SAKE...the entire set up is a MISERABLE. The stress of just BEING in that chaos defeats the purpose.

I assumed the tables am chairs would e dusty or weathered. This was not the case. Everything was well cleaned and maintained. The heaters were well placed and kept a all toasty. The only downside to the outdoor seating was that the sum was setting directly in our faces. This is not the fair of the restaurant.

Just as I expected, there are a few things that reminded me of my personal establishment. First off, we waited past our 90 minute quote. I was a little disappointed but I know how it goes sometimes. After waiting for nearly two hours the hostess seated me at a table that clearly was not cleaned off. I was amazed, breadcrumbs all over the table which was set. I decided to take matters into my own hands and clean off the table with my napkin. Then after my girlfriend picked her napkin off of her appetizer plate we saw that the plate had in fact been used. Gross!!! The server then came by and acknowledged the lack luster table spread and addressed our concern.  At this point I was a little heated. First the wait, now a dirty table. I mean I know things happen but it was starting to get the feeling it wasn't going to get any better! Maybe it just wasn't my day!!! With that said the rest of the meal was great. The food was timely and very tasty. The mac and cheese balls are great! I mean you feel terrible for eating them, but they are amazing! Oreo cheesecake was great too!

No menus were given, but we were happy to be seated, when along comes Jeff the manger accusing us of seating ourselves and not waiting but, rather jumping the line!

FIVE BUCKS.  Well, beer is $4. Ok, you can start sending me yelp compliments now...j/k... Sis and I recently discovered this Happy Hour but it was kind of on a sour note. She purchased an expensive cheesecake for husband's bday and that cheesecake turned out to be pretty bad.  Management let us return it and gave us a gift card (not a full refund on credit card and not a full amount on gift card either).   But that's how I found out about their HH b/c we had to wait around for quite some time for manager to issue gift card.  Their HH is no where to be found online or on their website. So hoping this review will help fellow yelpers out there.  Here are the list of their 16 (yes, 16!!) HH items: Roadside Sliders Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip Avocado Eggrolls Fried Macaroni and Cheese Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Southern Fried Chicken Sliders Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Guacamole Made-To-Order Tex Mex Eggrolls Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke Factory Nachos Buffalo Blasts Chicken  Pot Stickers Crispy Crab Wontons Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread Do you know how long it took to type that out.   We had: - Mojito $5: really good. A nice portion and I loved how they used plenty of fresh mint for this drink - glass of cabernet $5: decent pour but not the best cab we've ever had for HH - Southern Fried Chicken Sliders: Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles Four sliders come out and each sweet roll has a fried piece of chicken. The sweet rolls are buttered and grilled (yummy!). I thought the fried chicken was dry but friend thought this was a really good slider. - Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip: A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread It's not a large portion but it's sufficient enough as the cheese is pretty rich. It did taste like real crab was used as well. I wasn't a fan of the toasted bread crumbs on top. - Avocado Eggrolls Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. This is my favorite appetizer here at The Cheesecake Factory. the deep fried avo eggrolls here are divine. The avocado is creamy and plentiful. The eggroll wrapper is fried perfectly and provides a nice crunch to this dish. The selling point really is the tamarind dipping sauce. It has such a unique sweetness to it that I just love so much. - Guacamole : Made To Order Not bad. You can request the guac to be made mild/med/spicy. Was it the best happy hour we've been to? I wasn't too impressed with the food but I wasn't all that hungry that early evening. But when was the last time you had the chance to choose from 16 items on a Happy Hour menu. When was the last time you saw ANYTHING on TCF's appetizer menu for $5. It felt like finding a nickle on the ground (versus a penny). You know that feeling...

Service is just okay.  Sometimes it is difficult to get your server's attention and they don't check on you enough.  Water glasses stay empty much longer than they should. Most disappointing however, is the food.  They can't ever seem to bring the bread out in a timely manner, or they will bring out only one kind of bread (and it's never the rye!).  And I ALWAYS order the farfalle.  It is my favorite forever.  I don't care if it's 87894354657653 calories.  MY FAVORITE.  So, the first time visiting Escondido TCF, I order my favorite dish that I have had many times before in Fashion Valley.  It was so disappointing that I ordered something different the next visit.  We went to Fashion Valley a month after this disappointing trip, ordered the farfalle, and we both agreed that Escondido just doesn't have a handle on the recipes.        Also, wtf is with Escondido CHEESECAKE FACTORY constantly running out of CHEESECAKE flavors?  It seems they are always out of the flavors we want to try-- as early as 6pm!   Get your shit together, Escondido Cheesecake Factory.  We may try this location again sometime later after they have had a chance to work out all the kinks and get the recipes down.  For now we will continue to drive to Fashion Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0160000000000005,3.0000000000000004

It wasn't a major deal for us since we were really there for a little celebration dinner and had just assumed that happy hour would be a perk given the time were having dinner. We all know what happens when you ASSume though. When were first arrived and asked for a table for 7, the hostess asked if we wanted to squeeze into a booth meant for 6. Not sure how to react, we all agreed that we preferred booth's anyway so we would give it a try. Thank goodness for the waitress in our section for saving us from ourselves and pointing our we'd probably be more comfortable with more elbow room once the food came out. If only we had been able to be moved to a different table in that same waitress's section. She seemed great and in good spirits. Our new waitress wasn't very friendly or enthused about anything. We had to ask for bread and water. Both the water and bread came right around the same time as our appetizers and our second round of drinks. Maybe she was turned off by the fact that she was assigned such a large group at the end of her shift or maybe she knew she'd be leaving before we were done and just didn't care. Whatever the excuse, it was clear she wasn't going to be putting much effort into helping us.  The waiter who took over her shift really made sure that we left on a good happy note. He came in/took over halfway through our  meal and still turned the entire experience around. I'm not sure if he had to share any part of the tip with the other person who waited on us, but I sure hope not. He deserved all that and more. The food was pretty good. It did seem a little over priced for the quality, but the portions and plates themselves were huge so maybe that makes them worth it? I am not sure. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp curry plate and it was too sweet to really enjoy. The cheesecake was delicious. Although being stuffed from the drinks, appetizers and large portions, we obviously could NOT go to cheesecake factory and NOT order cheesecake. So we took it home to enjoy once awakened from the food coma we were all about to experience. Cheesecake was good and it was a huge slice (as it should be at $8 a slice). It was basically 3 desserts in one as it lasted 2 days in the fridge so I was able to enjoy a few bites a few different time throughout those two days before I tossed the last bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400,3.28,3.06,3.06,3.0840000000000005,3.1480000000000006

She didn't put my leftovers in the bag with the rest of my family's though :( so the next day when I went to eat my food, it was nowhere to be found! Also on that visit, the waitress forgot to bring my dad's drink for the longest time and brought the cheesecake we ordered to go out on a plate. Just a bunch of little things kept happening, pretty annoying. On this last visit, just last night, everything was good, up until I got home and found that my waitress gave me the wrong cheesecake! My friend texted me saying she had mine and I had hers. We live an hour from each other so it's not like we could switch back. I guess I should've checked before I left, but when the waitress hands me a bag and says ""here's your cheesecake"", I trust the waitress. I guess I'll double check in the future.

546,Kevin M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,125,1.0,4.0,2014-04-28,"This review is based off of two separate visits. I cannot recall the exact days but what I do recall is that our female server (a younger African-American server who told us she is studying at CSUSM) was very friendly, warm, and had a lot of suggestions to offer when we were interested in exploring new dishes; she also knew her menu quite well. Everything was great with her and our time there was enjoyable. I was considering giving a three star review simply because the server that took care of us the second time was not good at all and had zero personality, nor did he seem to even care about interacting with us or giving us service. He appeared annoyed that we had already purchase our libations (drinks) at the bar before sitting down or maybe that we were conversing in Spanish at the table. Originally, there was a 45-minute wait for a table so we decided to grab some cocktails to hold us over before sitting down at our table of four. The service area that really shined was the bartenders. There were two male bartenders working two Saturday nights ago and not only were they super friendly but super accommodating. The regular mojito I ordered was amazing, and I am usually very critical of mojitos since I make them at home but this one was top notch and I told the bartender it was one of the best I have had (he was working the service station/well for all restaurant orders). Anyways, the two bartenders that served us even offered to walk over one of our guest's hot teas to the table where we were moved when our table was ready. Now that is service! It was until our experience started with our server that it was a total let down. We dropped over $150 at the table but he couldn't be bothered with anything and was pretty much non-existent the entire time. I believe this was around 9 or 10 p.m. two Saturdays ago. Other than that, I would chalk it up to a 2 out of 3 situation. I would just simply ask to have another server next time so that somebody who is waiting on us actually appears to even have some small percentage of satisfaction in what they are doing because he apparently did not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600,3.4,3.03,3.03,3.12,3.178

Overall, we had a good experience.  We had no wait., so that was awesome, but after a few minutes we realized we were FREEZING.  We asked to move outside to defrost, but she said they only had one table available out there and it was in full sun and not very comfortable.  As our food arrived right then, we decided to stick out the cold a little longer. As for the food, the husband had chicken wings, which he loved.  They were pretty big and even a la carte, were enough for a meal for him.  I ordered off of the ""skinny menu"" which I was happy to find had normal sized portions!  I had the lemon shrimp that came with asparagus and a small amount of capellini.  It was delicious AND I had room for cheesecake.   Well, as for the cheesecake, I take full responsibility for not asking questions.  I ordered the carrot cake swirled cheesecake because it listed on it that it had almonds... most carrot cake does have walnuts which I am mildly allergic to. And I should have asked instead of assuming the almonds were all the nuts that would be there, but walnuts were swirled throughout so i was picking them out... not as yummy.   Our server was very friendly, but a little on the forgetful side and possibly new.  She mixed our order with someone else's and the bill had to be re-arranged and she didn't get the add on scoop of ice cream with the cheesecake or the ranch instead of bleu cheese.  She made up for it with being very nice, though. I thought it was a little loud in there, but the husband disagreed.  The ladies room was neat and clean as was the rest of the restaurant. We'll definitely go back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220,3.48,3.05,3.05,2.8280000000000003,3.222
478,kip w.,"Escondido, CA",0,22,,4.0,2014-05-31,"We ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Escondido last night and I was really surprised at how good the food was. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent. Tender, juicy, a smoky flavor that was very smooth and a sweet sauce that actually complemented the meat. So often sauces overpower the meat (just as well as often the meat is crappy) but in this instance it was a perfect balance. My wife had the Pit Beef Dip. Man that was a huge success. Again the sauce (au jus) was really great. Lots of flavor and well seasoned. The meat was tasty, fontina cheese was an excellent accompaniment, the horseradish sauce was tangy without being overbearing. In general I find Escondido to be a food wasteland, so this was a pleasant surprise. The sandwiches were well thought out and well executed. Last week we ate at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Vegas and the flavor profiles at the Cheesecake factory were more interesting and better layered. They have a huge selection of food which is nice as so many chain restaurants do ""theme"" food like Mexican or Italian. My only gripe was that they had a huge selection of chicken dishes but very few beef or pork choices. How excited can you get about chicken? Oh yeah we got a slice of the Chocolate Fudge Tower cake to take home. It was huge, moist, thick and fudgy and was definitely a wow finish.

I had to rely on the kindness of strangers to open the doors (yes, both doors. One door could not accommodate my wheelchair); apparently the 4 cheesecake factory workers at the host stand couldn't be bothered with opening the door for a customer; let alone a handicapped paying customer. Once inside, the was no easy way to the restrooms. There are two aisles to get you to the restrooms; both aisles had baby seats in the aisles and I could not fit. I had to ask the parents of the babies to move them so I could get by. Just a little embarrassing. To top it off, the restroom was disgusting and I could not even reach the sink.

288,Janet B.,"San Marcos, CA",365,361,358.0,2.0,2014-06-24,"Cheesecake. Oh how I love thee... That being said, this is not one of my favorite locations. Actually, having been here twice and having one of my really good friends work here does not even make it any better which is sad and even more dissappointing because I'd much rather spend my $20 gas in going and driving that much farther to my fave- irvine or 2nd fave- fashion valley. I had been dying to come here and after the first time, noticed a. How small it was and b. How slow and not so awesome the customer service is. After tonight (my 2nd time) it's actually reaffirmed my convictions and makes me coming a third time that much harder!  We came here, me and my mom, starving and ready to throw down money and eat like queens but upon arriving- we're told that we could sit outside (which at 9pm was way too cold) or wait 10min and be seated inside. Of course- I waited to be seated in, with both me and my mom having forgotten our jackets. The hostess tells me she'll take my number down and text me when our table is ready and I kindly soak it in (secretly ecstatic cuz I love technology like the nerd I am) but also let her know we would wait just off to the right (on the benches were no one else is waiting).... There didn't seem to be much of a line and I saw many open tables, only for me to get my text that my table was set, go up to her who had forgotten my name and then her walk away completely unannounced and me bewildered waiting as to what the hell was going on (excuse me, lol). She then came back, ignored us. We saw someone else get seated and then I asked (granted I was in front of her this WHOLE time) and she said ""just a sec"". Well that ""just a sec"" turned into 3 minutes where she seats us in this tiny cramped corner that had been OPEN THE WHOLE FRIGGIN TIME WE WERE WAITING. --- as I sit down, I see the floor is wet and in disgust, embarrassingly ask her if there is possibly anywhere else to sit (as I look around and see many open tables). As my mom gets up, she mentions her side is wet too and I see a look of PAIN on her face. My poor mom had slipped on water that had been underneath the table! And the whole time the waitress does not apologize, say a word, just that they ""wax the floors"" (oh great safety concern). I saw my mom had a hard time walking (she's elderly and is not one to complain & I asked to speak to a manager at some point.... Who didn't come over until about 10minutes into my meal. Granted, he actually came over and ""thanked"" us for notifying him but when telling him I'd like to report the incident, in no way takes it into consideration, choosing to ignore my words as if nothing was said. Yes, he offered us comped cheesecake for her pain. But don't birthday people who are celebrating also get it automatically whether or not it's even actually their birthday???.... I was not impressed. He never came back. Our waitress was great, my food was great ( ordered my usual Tuscan chicken since I'm dieting and doing no carbs) and although my moms steak Diane with shrimp looked good - her shrimp had been a bit burned (and by burned I mean I could see it blackened from far away & I'm near sighted). I could tell she was too shy and emabarassed to say something. There really should've been better service and more attention to detail and I quite think the cheesecake was just not enough for the whole trouble of the night. At least my wine should've been comped or something for me trying to make an attempt to enjoy myself over dinner after the horrible service we had experienced. We really go to cheesecake on a weekly basis but I think next time i would rather wait til we can make the trip to irvine or San Diego. I'm quite dissappointed in the esco location, despite how new it is.  The service is inexperienced from what I have seen(I'm sorry but it's true) and the amount of time It takes to be seated is slow (when it seems like it's not really that busy).

452,Kaitlyn W.,"San Diego, CA",4,14,6.0,2.0,2014-07-19,"First, let me just start out that the burger that I ordered was delicious. I had the Americano Burger and added egg on top - and it was wonderful. The reason that I gave this place two stars was HORRIBLE service.  The waitress that we had (I don't remember her name, but had short bright red hair - started with a 'T' if I remember correctly) was the worst that I have ever experienced. We waited about 20 minutes to sit down, which was completely reasonable on a Saturday so that was fine. Once we were seated I think we saw our actual waitress about 3 times total in the TWO hours that we were there.  It took about 30 minutes to have our drinks ordered, and about another 15 for them to be delivered to us with the bread. The white bread was horribly over cooked and tasted like it had been sitting in the oven for about an hour. Whole wheat bread on the other hand was amazing. When We ordered our drinks my sister had a water with lemon - but when it was delivered there was no lemon. Something that isn't very hard to manage. Mind you there was another man who delivered the drinks, not our waitress.  Shortly after getting drinks we placed our order (one Americano Burger - medium - with egg no tomatoes or onion, and a side salad. my sister ordered the Classic Burger -medium -  with a side of fries) It took ONE HOUR to get our food, not seeing our waitress one single time to check in on us, refill drinks, clear the table of the bread, or give us any update on how much longer.  Once we finally received the food the burgers were both cooked well done. I never received my side salad and there was about one squirt of ketchup for my sisters fries and burger. We flagged down the waitress, once again because she never checked on us, and asked for more ketchup, our drinks refilled and my salad. She made a sly comment that the kitchen staff wasn't really on their game today, which to me was a piss poor excuse as to why the service was terrible. Mind you my drink had been empty since the food was delivered. This was the last time that we saw our waitress. A busboy delivered my salad and the manager came out with our drinks. Thats when we asked for the Recees cheesecake and our check because we knew that it was going to take about another 30 minutes to receive both. The manager came out again with the desert about 25 minutes after we asked for it with the check. We did leave a note for the waitress thanking her for forgetting about us.  Under no circumstances is it okay to come to the guests only three times, one for getting our drink order, another for the food order, and once being flagged down by the guests. If we hadn't flagged her down I can guarantee that she would not have been at our table again. We were not demanding to her or spoke to her in any tone, so this was a terrible experience at such a common restaurant with decent reviews. It will be a while before I will return to the Escondido location - I would much rather drive to Fashion Valley to be respected as a paying customer rather than a hassle that you have to tend to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=480,3.36,3.16,3.16,2.7280000000000006,3.2400000000000007

However, the decor in the restaurant is so nice! One Saturday night, we came here at 10pm to avoid the crowds. (You still need to wait even if you come at 8pm, so that's why we wait till close to 10 to come. They close at midnight anyway.) We were happy to have the choice of outdoor seating and of course we did that! I kid you not, I feel like I'm dining at a 5-star hotel. Their outdoor furniture was classy and comfortable - some cushioned wicker booths. The dining table was probably made of plastic.. hard plastic... but it's carved! The torch heaters are such nice addition to the ambiance. They are hot in both temperature and appearance. On top of that, they make the back wall of the bar inside all glass, so we can see bottles of liquor with colorful lights from the outdoor seating area. What a nice hangout / date place! Well about the food. We got the yummy avocado egg rolls, pasta da vinci and the salmon and steak plate. We love all the dishes, and were particularly surprised at how well they made the salmon and the steak. The salmon was perfectly flavored and crusted, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The juicy and tender steak, with a delectable wine reduction sauce of some sort, definitely satisfied our palates.  Service was awesome too! The lady who served us was friendly, polite and sensible, in a way that she doesn't over-check on us. We concluded our meal with the Godiva cheesecake, big enough to share between the two of us. It's rich, creamy, decadent and chocolaty. Best of all, it's the only flourless cake on the menu! It's good, but I don't think I'll order it again. I'd rather try something else next time. Plus I've had better flourless chocolate cake elsewhere and eating this just kept reminding me of the other cake in the other restaurant... hm... Anyhow, we will certainly be back! Probably around the same late night time to avoid the crowds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=280,3.2,3.17,3.17,3.088,3.182

The most recent trip (which is prompting my writing of this) we were seated promptly but then ignored for almost 30 minutes before we complained and our waitress finally came over. I also found it annoying that she did not refill our drinks in a prompt manner. How am I supposed to eat my food without anything to drink?? She gave plenty of attention to her other tables but very rarely came to ours.....plus they were not that busy. All of the employees were just talking in the back.  The only reason I go back is because of the cheesecake.. otherwise they definitely would not receive any of my money.

The Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant where every single menu item is prepared so perfectly, you can't go wrong with ordering something you've never tried.            Every single dinner plate that was ordered on our table was superb. The Diane steak I ordered was cooked perfectly, and the Cajun chicken had spices that were chosen in order to satisfy your taste buds. But that's just the meal!

It's nice and refreshing to see how far it has become.   With all the upscale businesses and multimillion dollar renovation, it's refreshing to see that they opened a Cheesecake Factory here.  The space is smaller than the other locations in San Diego, but it brings a nice, cosy feeling to the restaurant. I ordered the hibachi salmon and it's pretty amazing.  It comes with vegetables and a bed of rice.  The hibachi sauce is tangy and offers a nice twist to the normal salmon that you probably bake at home.   I also tried the orange chicken, which kills Panda Express.  The offering was so huge that we had to take it home.   As far as cheesecakes, I believe that's what they do best, right?  I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  I tried the Dulce de Leche and it was amazing.  Will I come back?  Definitely, it's a nice change from McDonald's and Taco Bell that used to run NCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=300,3.48,3.33,3.33,2.9600000000000004,3.39
535,Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826.0,2.0,2014-08-24,"The quick of it: Food is good by Cheesecake Factory standards.  The downside is that this is the inner circle of hell where service goes to die a slow and tortured death. -------------- Sum-up of our almost 2-hour sojourn here at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner: Waiter: ""Would you folks like to order dessert?"" Me: ""Do we look like we have fucking time left for that!?!"" -------------- Excited for a new location closer to us than Fashion Valley, we made a trip from the coast for a night out shopping and dining.  Got there around 5:00pm with a hungry toddler and found the restaurant busy, but not packed, and only a 20 minute wait to be seated inside or out on the patio immediately.  We chose the latter so our son could eat quicker and asked for a high chair. Walking out into the oubliette ... whoop, patio, I meant to say patio, we were greeted with the warm sun on our faces, blinding low in the summer sky, and found that our table not only had no way of shielding us from this glaring brilliance that blazed like the unblinking eye of Ra, but also that no one bothered to bring a high chair.  After pointing this out, we were offered a booster seat ... for a squirmy 18 month old ... apparently they were loathe to move the umbrella that was covering nothing to make room.  We forced them to anyway and I sat down leaning forward to keep the sun out of his eyes. After 10 minutes and three other servers wandering by without paying any heed, we finally met our own waiter, a well meaning guy that was happy to take our drink orders.  Then we sat there, sun glaring down, my girlfriend slowly developing a nice burn, yet thankful for the cool wind blowing.  We quickly knew what we wanted to order, but were left to our own devices for a good 15 minutes. Then our drinks arrived!  And they were nice enough to bring bread!  As my son dove into the hard sourdough like a Gitmo prisoner coming off a hunger strike, our waiter asked if we wanted any appetizers to start.  Even the toddler stopped and gave him a look of incredulity.  Very patiently and nicely, we mentioned that we were actually ready to fully order, which we did.  But we were then left to stare at our drinks after he left because, even though we had asked initially, we were brought no Sweet 'n Low for our tea and no lemon for our water. We asked again, we sat ignored for a while again, we finished the bread, we eventually got our zucchini appetizer and a bowl of lemons with sugar after another 15-20 minutes of elapsed time. -------------- Excerpts from ""Dialogue of a Cheesecake Factory Waiter"", Escondido Edition: Waiter: ""Let me bring you more bread while you wait."" *Waiter leaves* *15 MINUTE INTERMISSION* *Waiter returns empty handed* Waiter: ""Would you like more bread while you wait?"" *Pause for laughter as the family stares in shock* -------------- We did get that second basket of bread, along with our food, over an hour after we first arrived.  My girlfriend did not have her tea refilled until about halfway through the meal, quite rough considering they just left us in the sun to sweat.  I was okay with my water, but only because I was able to steal the glasses of everyone else at the table.  And the food was good, standard Cheesecake Factory fare as I noted above. But, holy shit was that service bad.  We once watched our waiter come out to the patio, stand in front of a computer, and work on it for a good 8-10 minutes before going back inside ... while leaving a tray on top of it with someone else's ice tea and our bowl of lemon slices on it.  And there they sat in the sun for a few more minutes before he came back out and took care of it all. We also witnessed two other servers sitting down at an empty table and talking for 15 minutes.  I was under the impression that it was a manager telling a new girl what a good job she was doing ... you know, because ... IRONY! -------------- Selected scenes from ""A Night at The Cheesecake Factory,"" or ""Send in the Clowns!"" Waiter: ""Here is the coke for your son."" Me: ""We didn't order that .. he's only 18 months old!"" Waiter: ""He doesn't like soda?"" -------------- So, about 2 hours later we finally gave up on our guy and flagged down another server for to-go boxes and the check.  Our waiter was nice enough to say that he WOULD have put our leftovers into boxes for us if he had the chance to do so, but who has that kind of time? After assuming that we would be done in about an hour and have some time left for shopping after, we ended up with just a 40 minute sprint through the mall to check out stores we really wanted to see and then leave to get our son down for bed in good time. Thank you Cheesecake Factory ... you have soured North County Mall for us forever.  We could have come back to adopt a puppy from their pet store, but now that puppy will go unloved ... all because of your horrible service.

Waited for a table for a reasonable amount of time and occupied ourselves in the bar until our pager buzzed.  We quickly left our seats in the bar, which we had to wait for, closed out our tab and made out way over to the host.  We were acknowledged after a couple minutes with a buzzing pager I'm hand and asked to wait until someone could seat us.  That's when a pissed off server grabbed some menus, called our name even though the host has pointed us out to her, and proceeded to walk to our table, not stopping for other patrons to leave.  She then put our menus down and said, ""I'm going to be your server, l'll go grab waters and bread for you.""  Not a great first impression but she redeemed herself throughout the night.  The managers, however, did NOT.  One manager came over 15 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they had burnt my boyfriends meat loaf and had no more portions for the night.  When my boyfriend asked for his recommendation, the manager offered, ""a burger"".  Seriously? This whole menu and you choose a burger?  He ordered the enchiladas instead.   Our server came out seconds later to apologize and offer to bring my veggie burger.  No use in letting it sit under heat lamps.. But it already had.  Not only was the bun soggy, it came out with no grilled onions and... The patty was BURNT!  So I took three bites and ate my fries instead.  Our server came back with the enchiladas half way through my fries and said she would send a manager over to address the veggie burger.  This is what got me, instead of coming over, he just took my meal off our bill.  I'm not coming here for a cheap meal (obviously we were already three bar drinks and an appetizer deep when we ordered our meal) I'm coming here for the customer service!   When we asked to speak to a manager after ordering our dessert to go and paying the bill, we told him about our experience, reminding him throughout that it wasn't our servers fault.  He heard us out and then said, ""So what exactly were you unhappy with?""  Really?  We came here wanting a nice dinner for our anniversary, neither one of our entrees were up to par and no manager checked on us after they KNEW that out experience wasn't up to their chains standards.  He responded with, ""Can I get you a piece of cheesecake on us?""  If you had checked on us after the issues with BOTH of our entrees, then we would have taken a free slice.  At this point, we have already paid for one.

I went with my daughter for a birthday lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back and the waitress could not understand why. I told her you can get sick from raw turkey meat. It's not beef where if it is a little pink you can eat it. Anyway she took it back with attitude.  It came back still raw by then I had no appetite.  I asked to speak to a manager and he took it off the bill. He did apologize but no offer of a piece of cheesecake or anything. It was my birthday! They made it seem like I was crazy for sending it back. I got the district managers number on the way out. I called him the next day. He was very apologetic and sent me a 15 dollar gift card for a couple of pieces of cheesecake since it ruined my birthday lunch. My husband decided on Sunday,8/31/14,night to use out gift card for cheesecake. I was looking forward to if since I have been watching my diet and this was a splurge. He ordered the cherry CC for me and the Hershey's 30th birthday CC for himself . Well we get home and guess what they gave us Oreo CC and I thought Hershey's. I don't  like chocolate CC. I like the regular and that's why I got the cherry one.  I called and talked to Tony and he apologized and said he would send me a gift card so I can get the right CC.  Well my husband ate the second piece of CC which he had wanted the Hershey' s 30th birthday CC yesterday. Well it was chocolate peanut butter CC. So neither one if us got out what we wanted. I can't call now and yes he got two pieces of CC.  You want what you want and the receipt said cherry CC and the Hershey birthday CC. How hard is it to look at the receipt and do it right.

Service was OK, he was busy and didn't have time to come by much & drinks took a very long time but we weren't left wanting for anything so overall it was fine.  Food was a disappointment.  The quality to price point isn't even close to justifiable. Ahi capacio for appetizer. It looks like a pink gel you can see the plate through with 2 slices of avo, and a pile of wasabi. It's hard to eat since the texture is like a goop and you have to tear it apart and try and get it on a fork. Hard to explain, just don't do it. Entree: Steak Diane. The only flavor to the steak pieces was a ton of salt and pepper. I asked for A1 sauce in order to eat some of it. The only bonus to the price is the serving size is huge. The mashed potatoes are good (but those are hard to mess up), and the mushroom sauce is great and has a good amount of mushroom pieces. We had a gift card so that helped soften the blow a little bit.

It was not spicy. It was completely tasteless. So much so that I didn't even eat it.

My BIGGEST bone to pick with the cheesecake factory is the menu. I've been to the Cheesecake factory about 15-20 times. So, to say i'm not a fan isnt fair. I'm  really torn about giving The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars or 4 stars. I JUST LOVE CHEESECAKE!  Its a weakness of mine. But with 13 pages of food menu with 30+ different dishes at 13$ + per dish, you HAVE to master all these dishes. I try to order something different all the time but with the prices they charge, it's just risky...  Here's the thing.  - The burgers are different. Some are good but thats as far as the burger menu can go.  -The salad menu is good and the portions are HUGE! The Ranch dressing is great and it goes well with everything. -The pasta menu can be good. Some are really good (Louisiana chicken is my favorite).But the few other pasta dishes Ive tried  were  only decent.  -The sandwich menu is very questionable to me. I think Ive only ordered a sandy twice from there and after that I gave up. At the price, you would expect a restaurant to have the sandwich menu mastered with their own take and twists on basic sandies.  At the least they need to be stacking these sandwiches high with meat. They dont have that. The service is alright.The only complaints I have is that the waiters/waitresses need to relax and people time to decide with the menu they have and the p[rice we pay. I could go on but I think you should be getting the idea by now. Overall, its good but confusing to me.

Arrive early or expect to wait. Waiting is not that hard since you have a whole mall to pass the time with. They'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to worry about walking out of range while you wait. This is pretty much your only option since they don't do call-ahead seating or reservations.  Portions are large. The appetizers can be meals, and if you bag half your dinner you might be able to make it through dessert. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is just chocolate coconut goodness. The Original Cheesecake is probably the best classic cheesecake I've ever had -- not dense at all, your fork glides right down through the moist fluffy cheesecake and through the light graham cracker crust. The thin sour cream layer adds a fresh tartness. Worried about the sour cream? It's not overwhelming and you can always balance it with a bit of the free-standing side of whipped cream.

My sis and i are from out of town and decided to eat here because I mean who doesn't love the cheesecake factory?! We frequent the rancho cucamonga and Anaheim locations so we are very familiar with the food. 1) service is very bad. We had a great waitress to end our meal but the first one wasn't very attentive.  We were happy when she came back after a million hours and told us she was leaving. 2) the food wasn't what we were used to. I ordered the breaded chicken dish with mashed potatoes (which had a grayish looking color and we're COLD), and asparagus (that were soooooooooooo limp and cold). The sauce was non existent and sucked up by the not so great chicken. We also ordered the Buffalo blasts that are normally a little more cheesy and not so runny with sauce. Bit into one and it burned the crap out of my mouth and hand and lacked the flavor we are both used to. Her and I both shared each others food and this is the only place we had food at the entire day. We both end up sick. I call to complain, not even demanding anything and he tells me since I was the only complaint he can't really do much and corporate would get back to me. 1) I've worked in the restaurant business for almost 10 years. 2)Being that I'm a customer I should be RIGHT and my coming back should mean something.  Obviously it didn't.

Our food was finally delivered to our table which was great except it cam before our appetizers. ....oh wait the appetizers never came...oh wait yes they did on the bill.....we pointed out to her that they were on the bill and she got an attitude and rolled her eyes and walked away with the bill and showed the manager who then came over and offered us free desert...although we appreciated the offer we opted to pass and while he was talking to us the waitress was standing about 15 feet away from us pointed at us as she talked to another  waitress and complaining about us.

After walking in I really loved the atmosphere and how everything was set up. The hostess was nice and our server was great.  My mother and I both ordered pasta. She got the Da Vinci and I got Fettucini with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes. We were starving so when the food came out we quickly dove right in. BOTH pasta's had absolutely no flavor even though it looked delicious! I tried my my mother's dish and sure enough it was bland as well, although mine was a little worse. I had to add mountains of salt just to give it flavor. I was not enjoying it at all therefore I took most of it to-go hoping I could fix it at home. Not to mention I started to feel sick, probably from all the salt I added. I'm not quick to say something tastes bad because I eat almost anything. That's how I know this was a big fail.  I was very disappointed, knowing how much I would have to pay for a horrible meal and I proceeded to tell my mom that maybe pasta is just not their specialty. My mother then told me she had a pasta from another Cheesecake Factory only two months prior and it was delicious. So I think it boils down to the cook who made ours. I've worked in the restaurant business before and I know that the food tastes better depending on the time you go and the cook you get. So either the chef or one of the cooks has a lot of work to do. I can say that whoever made our pastas does not know how to cook at all. The only reason I'm giving three stars was because our White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake was delicious, and because the customer service was great! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but everything should be good at a large chain restaurant like this.  Sad to say I probably will not go back to the Cheesecake Factory.

Bartenders were extremely friendly and accommodating as possible knowing that we have been waiting for that long of a time frame!

It is also completely fat and calorie filled but who is counting calories? I always sit at the bar when I come here because there's no way I'm going to wait an hour to be seated in the restaurant. If you do come here and I want to sit in the restaurant then I suggest that you put your name on the list way before you're even hungry. They'll take your phone number down and call you when your table is ready and then you can roam around the mall until your table is ready. They have a legit happy hour where some of their drinks and select house wines are $5. Their appetizers are also cheaper and the portions appear to look the same as a regularly priced appetizer portion. I have eaten a lot of the food and everything I've had is always good so just close your eyes and point somewhere on the menu and order it I'm sure it'll be delicious and you will love it. Try the farfalle pasta, it's to die for! If you share it with someone else you won't feel as guilty for all the calories. The fried mac & cheese balls are a must every time I come, my sister got the fried mac & cheese burger and she ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip the burger in. It sounds odd but you should try it.

When ever I come with my family we get the avocado egg rolls and if you like avocados you must try them, they are truly the best I have ever had.   The service here is why I feel this is a three star location. It is always busy and it seems most waitress/waiters have too many tables at once. I find it difficult to get my waiters attention if I need anything. They also do not take reservations or do call ahead seating so if you come on a weekend or busy night you will be waiting at least an hour if not longer.

My last server, Brent (Brett?), was just amazing. He was ready with suggestions, happy to wait when I took a little too long to figure out what I wanted. He took my salad back because there was way too much seasoning on it before I even noticed the error myself. He was just crazy aware, and friendly and rolling with his A game.  This place can be hit or miss as far as the food goes. The selection is huge and sometimes a little overwhelming. I know complaining about too many options is lame but there's just something a little too much about a menu that's more of a novel than a pamphlet. I can say though that it's a great place to take a large group of people with varied tastes. You also can't go wrong with taking a suggestion from your server as they generally all recommend the same seven go to dishes. Dessert of course is a MUST.

I'm very glad they opened up this closer, alternative location in North County Fair Mall. Depending on the time, however, it can get just as busy as Fashion Valley. I most recently dined here yesterday on a Friday for Happy Hour at 4pm (there was no wait!). We were a little early (waiters can't put in Happy Hour orders until 4pm because it doesn't pop up on their register until then), so we decided to order a slice of cheesecake first. Our kind waitress also suggested ordering off the small plates and appetizers options from the regular menu because some items are equivalent to Happy Hour prices anyways. I decided upon the Beets with Goat Cheese small salad (beets, apples, baby arugula, pecans and vinaigrette). Delicious and fresh-tasting, I'd definitely order this again and would suggest it to anyone who's looking for a light and savory dish. Also opted for trying the avocado eggrolls, mehhhhhh. For 620 calories (also listed as 960 calories on the internet), it wasn't worth the calorie intake. I love avocado, but not warm or stuffed in a fried eggroll wrapper.

For appetizers, I shared thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke with 3 other people. The lettuce wraps were delicious. It gives you enough to make 5 or 6 wraps with chicken. There are 3 different sauces to make the wraps. The artichokes were ok. Too much effort to eat just a small amount. I probably wouldn't get it again.  I shared the fettucini Alfredo with chicken with my husband. The lunch portion was enough for us to share.  Restaurants can either make fettucini Alfredo really good or really bad. It is really good here!  It is so creamy and flavorful.  For dessert, we shared the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. I'm not a big cheesecake person but it was pretty good.

Cheesecake Factory.. my all time fave restaurant! *Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambiance= a great meal and time!* I've been coming to this location for about a year and a half now since it's grand opening. Before the Escondido location opened I would go to Fashion Valley once in a blue moon for friends birthdays etc, but it's nice to have one in North County.  The first time I came it was Christmas Eve 2013 dinner, within a month of the grand opening.. it was the longest wait ever for a table (1.5 hours), and the longest wait ever for the food (it felt like eternity because I was starving!). I was trying to get my family to try it, especially my parents to show how Cheesecake is the best however they weren't that impressed (I must have picked the wrong time to bring them here).  I still came back though over the past year I've done regular dining and happy hours.. every visit had been wonderful. I've had great servers and the food has been top notch. Come to cheesecake to celebrate special occasions or just because.. and happy dining!  MY FAVE ITEMS ON THE MENU: 1. Buffalo Chicken Blasts: crispy fried breaded wontons with hot sauce & blue cheese.. this is so filling!  2.

He really stayed on the ball and was fun to talk to. We came on Saturday in the afternoon (lunch shift) so he gets recognition for his good work. We just shared an appetizer. It was good. They have a huge menu with tons of options. The cocktail we ordered was amazing! But we ordered a double and it came out to be a $20 cocktail. Wont be doing that again, but with a good beer selection (Green Flash West Coast my fave) we have plenty of options.  The only bummer is that this place is in the mall...I hate the mall.

Fries go cold almost immediately. It's like they microwaved the fries and onion rings before cooking the Steak. Steak looks dry from the outside but the insides are all gravy (juicy).

I have never seen basil turn to the consistency of black pudding so I'm still not sure if I buy that excuse. When I went to pay the bill I noticed they had charged me for 3 kids pastas and only comped 1 even though we only ended up eating 1 kids pasta. So after much confusion and delay having to send dishes back and wait for them to fix my bill I left pretty disappointed with how they handled the whole situation. I will not be back!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=500,3.0,3.31,3.192,2.7560000000000002,3.186

The wait staff are always friendly and I never have a problem with them messing up my orders. The only thing I could complain about is that sometimes I come here and it is soooo packed that it takes a good while before you can head inside to be sat. If it were a bigger place, I'm sure that wouldn't happen often but this location is pretty small for a Cheesecake Factory. When I order I usually get the buffalo blasts as and appetizer and they are never skimpy on those. I always have plenty to take home. My go to dinner is the meatloaf. I usually don't trust meatloaf unless it's mine but one day I was really craving it and I came here so I thought, ""why not"" and ordered it. I have no regrets. Super delicious.

568,Samin V.,"San Marcos, CA",1,42,1.0,1.0,2015-06-29,"Having only been to the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley and in Vegas,  I was expecting typical Cheesecake factory food and service, which had always been good based on my past experiences. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  We decided to stop in last week on a Friday for lunch while we were running errands at the mall. It was pretty dead inside, so we figured we could get in and out pretty quick. We were seated immediately. Our server (don't remember her name, but a younger blond girl with tattoo sleeves) took our drink order and food order. She was less than enthusiastic, but that was no big deal. We got our drinks and while we were waiting on our food, several other people were seated. Their food came and went, but no sign of ours. Our server finally checked in on us and let us know that the food was taking longer than expected. She offered us a cup of chowder, which was nice, but mind you this was about 30 minutes after we had placed our order. I asked if the salad that came out with my pizza could be brought out sooner. She said yes (ideally, they would have done this anyway, right?) and she brought my husband a cup of chowder. A little while after that, our food finally came out. My husband had ordered a chopped salad and I had ordered a pizza. Not sure why either of those things would take so long, considering that everyone else who was seated after us had pretty much received their food. The server (a different one) then proceeded to put our orders in front of the people at the table next to us. The girl next to us all but stuck her fork in my husband's salad before we realized those were our meals and corrected the server. The server picked the salad up from the other table and basically just plopped it in front of us.  We at our meals (again, without being checked on. We had to flag our server down for drink refills) and asked for the check. When the check came, I noticed that I had been charged extra for the wrong kind of salad. I pointed this out to our server when she came back. She told me that we had been charged correctly, and I again had to tell her it was incorrect and told her the correct menu price of my order vs. what she had charged me for. At that point, she figured out she was wrong and took the check back and had it corrected.  The food was fine, but I won't be going back because of the poor service. There are plenty of other options in the mall and around the mall with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560,2.88,3.25,3.172,3.0120000000000005,3.102

Their cheesecakes are just as good compared to the three cheesecake factories that I know of around SD area. I've been to the one next to fashion valley, downtown SD near Seaport Village, and then this one. They've all been equally just as good during my visits. I don't really order different food items/entrees so all the ones I've ordered have been consistent. That's the things about Cheesecake Factory. It doesn't matter where you're at, they're all gonna treat you the same I believe. There's an outside patio area to eat if you don't wanna be outside but then you'll be exposed to some workers taking a smoke break or shoppers tryna get a quick fix before they head in etc. There's a bar that can fix you any alcoholic drink you'd want.

The cheesecake menu is very large and it may take you about 10 minutes to decide on what you want. The service I had was really good like it usually is when I come here.  The first time eating cheesecake here I sat in the dining room and the service was wonderful with no complaints. I don't come here for the food but maybe I will have to start because the pics look good. Anyway so I ordered a hot chocolate which was pretty good in a nice size glass.

You're not the only customer ,and if someone is touching your child, you could politely ask them to stop. The problem with society today, is people are losing common sense and confidence.

When we got there (an hour before we told the rest of the party) we were told we had a 3-4 hour wait time. If we didn't live an hour away and had everyone traveling here already, we would have changed the location right then and there. But we waited for our party to get there hoping something would open up within the hour. In that hour we saw groups of 5-10 people being sat before us (after our party had already arrived). I took the liberty of speaking to the manager for my friend, because she was getting very upset. When I spoke with him, he was rude and spoke to me as if he was belittling me. Since we were waiting for well over an hour, you would think he would share a little concern seeing that we had pregnant women and children that we were entertaining. No compassion whatsoever. I told him that I found it ridiculous that they could sit groups that were only 5 people (including lap babies) less than us, who had come in an hour after us. With that he pretty much told me that was how the cookie crumbled. I informed my friend and our party, and we walked across the street to BJs who were more than happy to help us.

Then our waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. Didn't give us any recommendations so we just had water.... This is where everything took a turn down.

543,Elle K.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,26,3.0,1.0,2015-12-31,"What a terrible way to spend New Year's Eve! We checked in at the Escondido Cheesecake Factory at about 5 pm, looking for a table (for me, my husband and our baby). We were told 40 minutes, but that we should come back in 35. So we walked around the mall, then returned and waited from 5:35 until 6:10 when we finally left -- an hour and 10 minutes after we checked in, and 30 minutes after we were told we would be seated. I understand: it's New Year's Eve and it's busy. Fine. The problem is that when we checked with the front desk, we were told it would ""only be a few minutes"" and that we were ""next"" over and over, and yet they continued to seat tables of two and four ahead of us. They were obviously skipping over us -- I don't know why they could not have given us one of those tables of two or four. Finally, after we were told we were next and then they proceeded to seat another group of four ahead of us, we just left. There's only so long one can keep a baby entertained in a restaurant waiting area, and by 6:10 it was getting too late. It really ruined my NYE because, as parents, we only have a certain window of opportunity to dine out in the evening ad. Have an overpriced meal. A 40 minute wait would have been within that window. A. Hour and a half was not. So disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. They really need to train their people better. If they'd told us the wait was over an hour, that would have been fine. If they had seated us instead of skipping over us, that wound have been great.

We got worried as to if they forgotten us because others who came after us were already seated. Whether they had reservations or other reasons is uncertain. Upon being seated, I noticed the seats were a bit dirty still and so was the table. I ended up taking a napkin and a bit of water to at least clean the table.  Food is always great. No complaints there. My one main complaint was my drink. More than half of my drink was filled with ice. One doesn't pay for a drink just to have ice. I ended up taking out majority of the ice onto a saucer. My fiancee was baffled as to how much ice there really was. I didn't bother asking for another one just because of how busy it was.  We forgot how big the portions are and ended up taking much of the food home with us, which worked out well for my fiancee so he could have something to take to work for his lunch. If only we didn't order an appetizer and perhaps share the main dish then we could've tried out a dessert.  Overall it was a good experience.

It was a simple order for a drink that's all...and this is what happened, the night before we went we had an amazing dinner our waiter was fantastic, anything we needed he was bending over backwards to take care of us, we decided to go one more time before leaving the area back home. As the waitress sandy approached us I asked her if I may have a frozen mango drink with some alcohol, in an intense she started giving us attitude and trying to explain what I was asking for impossible that they have certain rules there at the cheese cake factory, if I want any additional alcohol in my drinks they charge extra for every shot and on top of that I have to poor the shot in myself and mix my drink....are you serious?????if I wanted a little bit of liquor in my drink I have to poor it into myself??? On top of that I explained to her that the night before there was no questions asked about the same drink. She then goes and leaves and says I'll find out, after that she came back talking to me like I was a child, with very rude attitude, she explained they could do it for me but will have to charge me extra I said no problem.....she charges me 7.50 for the drink and an additional 12.50 for 2 shots of vodka I got 2 drinks and paid 36.00 plus tax about 40 bucks for 2 drinks that had a total of 4 shots 2 in ea drink!

Fried Chicken Sliders were a pleasant and tasty surprise with deliciously tender but, crispy, well seasoned meat. Everything is served on the side which works well for my produce-hating husband. Yup, just give him the meat please. The tomatoes, pickles and lettuce were perfectly fresh and the latter two added the most perfect extra crunch for me. We also ordered nachos and here's where it got amusing. Everything on the side. Literally everything. If it ain't meat and cheese the hubs wants no part. So, the waiter graciously obliged to place the order with chips and cheese only and brought out little dishes with the sour cream, Pico de gallo and, guacamole on the side. I swear my husband missed out as the guac and Pico were outstanding and the perfect accompaniment to the cheesy chips. He actually apologized profusely for his fussiness to which the server, a wonderful young man named Andy, smiled and reassured my hubs it was not a problem at all.

Obviously, it is their intention to discourage large groups. After we were seated, our server took awhile to get our drinks and did not come back to give us any refills. Unless you put in your order when you order your drinks expect dinner to be awhile. And if you have youngsters, we had one, do not eat here unless you want your dinnertime to be super stressful with constant whining.  Putting it bluntly, we had very slow service to make a long story short. They must be short staffed on weekend evenings (maybe bad planning or just mismanagement). Their only saving grace was that the food was a good standard. The portions on the egg rolls are cut smaller than they used to be and the salad dressing on the salads have changed, but the rest of the food was acceptable, just not worth the 2 hour wait to eat. We saw our waiter a total of 3 times, when he took our order, when he brought boxes for leftovers and to give us the bill. And we had to ask for the boxes and the bill.

479,Sam S.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,1.0,2016-07-21,"This place has excellent burgers, but they aren't worth the wait. Two visits ago, I ordered a well done Old fashioned or classic burger, which is very thick and delicious, as I always did. I ordered it 100% plain, the easiest order ever. When everyone else's food came, they informed me they had accidentally put cheese on my burger and started cooking me a new one, and said it would be 40 minutes to an hour. Considering it had already been 40 minutes to an hour, I decided to settle for an order of kids chicken strips. 40 minutes to an hour later, they also brought me a burger. When we paid, they had comped the chicken strips and the burger, plus given me a free slice of cheesecake. Fast forward to our next and final visit. Since I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I ordered the same thing as last time. Another person ordered the same thing with everything on it except cheese. When our meals come, I surprisingly get exactly what I ordered, and once all but the other burger arrives they inform us the other burger had cheese put on it. So she said she'd just take chicken strips as a substitute, which took about 20-30 minutes. None of us had eaten during this time, so all our food was cold by the time we could eat together. At the end of the meal, no burger had arrived or cheesecake been given to us. When we were paying, I checked the receipt, and they had charged us for the substitute chicken strips. We had the newer but not new manager come over to our table and explained to her our problem. She seemed less than apologetic, though she did unhappily comp the chicken strips. At this point, we didn't even mention the salad they had messed up and simply left. I can proudly say we will never come back to this location again. The single star given is for the delicious food.

Went there for cheesecake but by the time we got done shopping and got seated it was time for dinner so we decided to have dinner before the cheesecake.  Service was fantastic. No complaints there. Had to wait for over 20 mins to get seated but oh well, I can live with that. Everything looked so amazing that we decided it was worth the wait.  Once we were seated, the waitress got our order, and brought us our drinks and some bread with butter to keep us happy till our food made it to the table. We ordered two medium cooked cheeseburgers - one old fashioned for my husband, and one mac and cheese for our 10 year old, and a farmhouse omelette for me. 20 mins later we had our food. One of the burgers came medium-rare, almost rare, and the other one came well done. Tasty but a bit disappointing that we didn't get the burgers cooked the way we wanted them. Tasty enough that we didn't send them back. However, we had to ask for a few extra tomato slices since both burgers only came with a small slice of tomato inside. Fries were excellent.  My farmhouse omelette dish was very disappointing! I chose a side of potatoes with it. The potatoes were bitter, had too much paprika and were burnt. Definitely not edible. Well, maybe good enough for someone starving who hasn't touch food in a week but definitely not good enough for someone paying good money for them. Someone needs to teach the chef how to cook (or fire him/her)!The omelette was tasteless. I would give it a 3 on a 10 scale. It was bad. I barely touched the dish. It was not good at all. I helped my kid finish her burger and stole some of the fries that came with it. They were fantastic! One of the best fries I've ever had!  We ordered the white chocolate raspberry truffle for our little one for dessert. It was very disappointing. I expected more for $7.45 per slice. Basic cheesecake with raspberry syrup that tasted very chemically, topped with two blobs of reddi-whip! Really, I expected more!  Based on our one time experience I don't think we'll be back there for dinner. Definitely not worth the price. But we might be back to try some of the other cheesecakes. They do look good.

I got transferred to one manager ( guy who's name I don't Remember , he asked to read my receipt to him at least 5 times , it seemed like he couldn't locate my order, then I got transferred again and went through the same process then got put on long hold only to be told that they will do feather research and call me back next day !!??? I was shocked , I was not offered to get new order of cooked pasta that I could literally have my husband run across the street and pick up . Guess what !!??? It's been over a week and I am still waiting for that call back .

Richard was pleasant, efficient, and let my friend and I chat and gab without hounding us to order. My friend ordered spring rolls off their skinnylicious menu and I ordered something I haven't had in years- romano crusted chicken with mashed potatoes (I subbed out the pasta for this). It was good..but for some reason, it wasn't as big as I remembered.  When I ordered it, I was thinking I would take some home for lunch the next day, but that didn't happen because I easily finished the whole thing. We also ordered two drinks- white wine for her and a blood orange mojito for myself.  Good combination. I'm not a fan of their cheesecake here so we passed on dessert. The meal was okay- a solid 'okay'.  It's probably the best option in the mall area, so if I was there and hungry, I would probably end up here.  Would I purposely decide to eat here again?  Not sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20,3.2,3.31,3.312,2.732,3.266

116,Hppn H.,"San Diego, CA",11,48,306.0,3.0,2016-09-05,"Well was in the mood for some dessert but as you know it, once you get here the smell of some dishes are very tantalizing.  Opted to take a booth outside as the evening was winding down and it was actually very nice.  So back to the initial plan, it was to grab some dessert and just hang out with the family.  After looking over the drink menu and with a few questions, opted for the Pineapple Mule.  Was told it was just the right amount of sweetness.  After the drinks came out, the appetite started to waiver a bit and we perused the menu again just in case something caught our eye, and as we have been to other Cheesecake Factory's, we saw the Avocado Eggrolls with the tamarind dipping sauce, and that has always been a staple for us.  Figured since we are here and the little one is behaving for the moment, lets just have dinner and hes wanting pasta, so lets kill two birds with one stone.   So dessert turned into dinner and here we go.  As noted, we have been to Cheesecake a few times in the past, so there are dishes that we like and others we have yet to try.  But being that we did not want to always order the usual, we opted for dishes we haven't had in a long while but thought it may be good to try again. So for appetizers, we opted for the Avocado Eggrolls and Hot Cheese and Spinach dip.  Lets say the eggrolls never disappoint, but the Spinach dip needed more to desire.  It came out hot with fresh chips, a side of sour cream and chopped tomatoes, but the kicker was the spinach and cheese seemed more like a side dish at a steak house rather than a cheesy dip.  That was lackluster at best and to boot, it was very bland.   Entrees we opted for the Crusted Chicken Romano, and the Carbonara with Chicken.  Now these fared much better in overall taste.  The Crusted Chicken Romano could have used a bit more sauce, but overall it was a decent dish.  The two cutlets and mound of spaghetti was not bad, but could have used a bit more salt. For the Carbonara with Chicken that was really good.  The sauce was thick and the noodles were coated well with the sauce so it was not dry.  It was not as rich in taste, but that is a personal preference, but the chicken was tender and the overall taste was good.  Would recommend this dish. Alternative:  We did not have the Shrimp Scampi tonight or the Spicy Chicken with Cashews (which you can also request with Shrimp) those are by far good solid dishes.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken with Shrimp is an original from way back, but they only show it with Chicken, however you can add the shrimp and definitely something youll want to go back for. As for the real reason why we came here initially was for dessert, after having the dinner feast we went down the list for something fresh and would clean the palate, and since we have tried the many cheesecakes before, there was one that we had yet to try and it was surely worth the trip down, and that was the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake.  Its tartness from the Key Lime and sweetness of the mango really cuts through the cheesecake giving you those layers of flavors that just hit the sides of your mouth and make it water.  If your looking for something to just have a fresh palate, that is a recommendation, but note it has sweetness to it, but enough where it just taste good.   If your in the mall shopping and want something decent, I would suggest hitting up this establishment and of course they have a full bar which is always nice if you've been shopping all day and need to unwind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=80,3.28,3.3,3.312,2.7,3.2920000000000003

We also ordered the Fish Tacos Tempura style. There were four street tacos with black beans and rice at a price of $13.95. Our server, Roberto, was pleasant, polite, very respectful and extremely professional. He gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and even asked if we would like bread and butter instead of automatically bringing it. Because there have been times where we go and just want soup and salad. I appreciated that. When it was time to order, he kneeled down so he can be at our level and also read back our order to ensure it was correct. I like that he took that extra effort. It saves time and any grief if the order came back wrong. He refilled my drink without me having to wave him down. When I asked for salsa, he kindly stated what options they had and brought my choice immediately. He also asked if we'd like the dessert menu.

135,Sean D.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2016-09-22,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant let alone a Cheesecake Factory. I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's in different areas, this was my first time at this location. I put my name down for a party of 7, even with empty two seaters around she said it would take 30 minutes, which was fine. After waiting the 30 minutes and seeing endless 2-4 top tables get seated that came in way after us, I went up to ask how much longer. The rude hostess said another 20 minutes after wanting to know why it would be that long she said it was because they were waiting for a table large enough to seat us. Being a waiter all throughout college, I knew this could be true. I asked why they couldn't just put some of the available smaller tables together, just section off what was available since we were waiting so long, which she said she couldn't do. After waiting another 20 minutes, I asked again and she rudely said another 20 minutes, which at that point was ridiculous. After waiting so long I went to the bathroom and noticed about 4/5 tables completely empty in the same area, when I brought this up to her she rudely said it was for a table of 11 people who requested it for 7pm. I was confused since at the Cheesecake factory you can't make reservations, she was incompetently and impolitely telling me that it wasn't a reservation. But in my mind a large group of people who put their name down for a specific time hours later is the exact definition of a reservation. The manager walked over and after asking him about this, she interjected and began practically yelling at me ""explaining"" how that wasn't a reservation and she would seat me when she would seat me. He didn't say anything he seemed completely clueless and unable to handle the situation. We decided to leave at that point, after waiting for over 70 minutes and go somewhere else close by. After another 30 minutes I got a text my ""table was ready"", guess by 40 minutes she met 100. All in all the hostess was extremely rude, the manager was incompetent and no one seemed to care.

The mac n cheese is perfectly breaded and covered in a delicious marinara type sauce garnished with Parmesan and parsley. We orders the farfalle chicken which is our favorite pasta ever. Perfectly prepared with peas, sun dried tomatoes, garlic and bits of bacon it leaves your mouth watering with every bite.

371,Kristi S.,"San Diego, CA",61,1,,1.0,2016-09-27,"My friend and I went here on Monday for lunch. The reason why I'm giving this location a rating of 1 star is not because of our awesome waiter or the length of our waiting time. (which was only about 10 minutes---not bad!!)   We were let down when ordering two times!!! The menu is so large, they obviously can't manage it.  First off, we ordered the loaded tater tots and were told they would be right out. A few minutes later the waiter came back and told us if we still wanted them we would have to wait an hour! We obviously didn't want to wait an hour for tater tots so we ordered the factory nachos. The nachos were crispy but my love ended there, way too light on the toppings and nothing but the taste of salt near the bottom.  Now for our next let down.  We were done with our nachos and were ready to split a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the Kahlua cheesecake. This option was met with adoration from our waiter as he told us this was one of the best cheesecakes and that we would love it! We were totally looking forward to our dessert.  Then back comes the waiter, with a look on his face of Sorry, you're screwed again. He began to apologize and let us know they no longer carried the cheesecake. We laughed at first and were like seriously, let down again!!!!! He said he would send the manager over.  I would have to say the manager handled the situation very poorly.  He began to try and explain to us why the tater tots had to be unfrozen because they ran out the night before ....now guys, we were eating lunch at 1:00pm....you'd think they'd know they couldn't offer one of their ""popular"" menu items and let us know. He then began to tell us they 86'd the Kahlua at a meeting the night before and he just hadn't changed his menu!!!! Seriously!!!! You're fired in my eyes!

Then when she comes back she literally rips the napkin off my mother's drink to pick up the ice....I've never seen anything like it. So inappropriate. Finally, we get a new server, Alyssa.

One day it's great then you go back and order the same thing it's terrible like night and day. I'm not sure what goes on there because I know the recipes are standardize so I'm assuming that staff does not care about food quality and the people that are paying to keep them employed. So I try to avoid this place at all costs. I mean who can't get fried Mac and cheese balls right all you have to do is heat and serve. I get this little burnt balls to the table most of the time.

Highly recommend the chicken addition as the chicken is tender and delicious. She also had a cosmopolitan and a gin & tonic. She enjoyed both and said they were very generous with the alcohol (a huge plus for a younger crowd). We finished with the dutch apple caramel struessel cheesecake and it was incredible. The beginning started with the taste of your typical dutch apple pie and continued into a nice moist cheesecake. Incredible, just like many of their other cakes.  The service was also incredible. It only took 5 minutes to get a table at 6:30 PM. They also made sure to follow our request of outside by a heater. Only tip: Bring a sweater since only one side is next to a heater.

My family ordered the GF Turkey Burger and the Thai Salmon, which they seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. In the description it mentioned that the shrimp is marinated in a ""Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce."" I ordered it because I thought it was spicy. I even added some hot sauce and still the sweetness of the shrimp sauce was overbearing. The shrimp was very sweet and there wasn't even the slightest amount of kick to it. Therefore the pineapple and plantains on the side did not go well with the sweet shrimp. The whole dish was too sweet. The black beans and rice were like any other black beans and rice. It's hard to mess those up, but they were good. I love cheesecake factory, but this dish just wasn't up to par with what I'm used to. The description of the dish needs to be changed.

Because what child doesn't like bananas?  I'm not sure if this was kosher with the manager but she didn't seem to care.   The rest of the service was kind of standard with great service on refills, checking in on us every once in a while, and always smiling and waiving at our kidd-o.  Then the bill came.  She asked if we wanted any to go containers for any of our food... and drinks... What the whaaaaat?!?!  I hope I don't get anyone in trouble for this, but the simple gesture of getting us a $0.05 cup to have one refill of a drink that cost them $0.005 to make and cost me $2.50 has completely solidified this cheese cake factory as my ""I'm going to always eat here when I'm at this mall"" place.  So to the manager, if you're reading this and worried that this small cost of a cup and a banana is costing you, I assure you, in the long run, it is not.   Sadly, I don't remember the waitress's name but I do remember how she treated us and will now have a gold standard to hold all food service people to.   Oh yeah, the food was great too.

This was my first & LAST time at this location. Our server Maria was horrible. After being seated for about 8 minutes before being acknowledged, she finally came over & took our order drinks. Usually, this is around the time I'm asked if I would like to order an appetizer, but no. She did bring us out bread & water, but set it down and left, without a word.

She comes over, takes our order for food & appetizer at the same time. Still don't have our drinks. She finally brings them & then the appetizer comes out. OK, cool. When I get my mac & Cheese burger there's no condiments with it. She walks past us numerous times for 5 minutes without so much as a glance in our direction. She helps all3 tables around us but never comes over. I decide to start my timer on my phone to see how long before she checks on us. Another 10 minutes passes & she finally stops. By this time I'm ready to leave, I'd had enough. I took 3 bites of my dry burger. I asked for a box & she asked if the food was okay. I just said its fine as to not cause a scene.

He continued to check in on us to make sure we had what we needed but we didn't feel like we had to hurry up and leave.  We shared the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread. So yummy! Perfect size to start your meal for two or big enough to eat by yourself as your dinner. I ordered the Pasta da Vinci. I love this dish as it has three of my favorite things- chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions. The portion size is large so you can take leftovers home and eat the following day.   To drink, I was disappointed that my usual cocktail was removed from the menu. :( I tried something new and ordered the Georgia peach (blended cocktail) first. It was tasty but could have used a bit more liquor. For my second round, I ordered the blood orange margarita. Maybe I am a lush, but once again, it could have used more tequila.

The Cheesecake Factory is really nice. The ambiance is great. The staff is very welcoming and looks out for the customer. I really appreciated how kind everyone was from the hostess to the waitress. The food was once again food from the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge but the quality of food is subpar. While I was there I ordered the rib-eye steak. It was a good quality steak. Not as good a steak that you might get from a steakhouse but a solid steak. If you're at the mall, this is a great place to stop for food with family and friends. The staff is very great. The food is ok. The main reason to come here is the atmosphere and the ambiance of the location. I did have one problem which was the wait time to get a table.

41,Vincent P.,"National City, CA",397,228,2257.0,2.0,2017-02-20,"The only redeeming factor about Cheesecake Factory is their cheesecake. Everything else, not so great.  After coming here on a Saturday and being told the wait was over an hour, we decided to come back the following Sunday. Turns out, that didn't help either as the wait was still over an hour. If you have a party of over 2, don't bother coming on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night.  They don't take any reservations so your only option is to physically come here and wait it out. Worst yet, when you stroll around or go to the bathroom during your wait, you see multiple empty tables around. Do they have a pact with the stores in the mall so people are more inclined to shop while they wait? Do they just like to make people wait to inflate their ego? Who knows.  After 75 long minutes, we were finally seated. Got the complimentary bread and it was good. Then we ordered. We got our small plate of chicken taquitos which were decent.  Then we waited for our entrees. We waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. It probably took them a solid 45 minutes to get the food out. The manager did come out to apologize and say everything would come out shortly. But when you've waited 2 hours in total and only have bread and 2 bites of a taquito, the apology becomes a moot point.  .... so a day and a half later, we finally get our entrees (exaggerating). I got my Smokehouse BBQ burger. ""Burnthouse"" would've been a more ideal name for it. One of the bacon strips was burnt so I threw it out. The beef patty was cooked a medium well even though I asked for medium. It was way drier and less juicy than I wanted. The fries were way too greasy. I tried really hard but couldn't finish my meal. When I went back home, I felt like crap.  The other dishes on our table were a chicken pasta and an angus beef sandwich. These 2 items were not even mediocre. The chicken pasta was dry and minimal in flavor and the angus beef was servee with too many pieces of pure fat. Yikes.... all of the entrees missed. Worst yet, at $15-$20 an entree, you're essentially throwing your money into a fireplace ordering these.

35,Jeff T.,"San Diego, CA",8,80,285.0,5.0,2017-04-10,"I'm not sure why the reviews of this Cheesecake Factory (Westview North County Mall) are so harsh. Most of the 1 star reviews are for bad service or long wait times. If it's not your first time here, the possibility of a large crowd and long wait should be no surprise. You can decide whether to wait just by looking at the gathering in the lobby. I think it's only fair to get pissed if the receptionist grossly underestimates the wait time. That hasn't happened to me yet and usually the buzzer they hand out goes off sooner than they say it will. The food and atmosphere are excellent and priced right. The menu is huge and I find it hard to believe there isn't something delicious for everyone. I love mushrooms so the Chicken Madeira and Da Vinci pasta are my go to dishes. That sauce is so good. The Chipotle Chicken Pasta is delicious too for a change of pace.  The kids menu has real food and portions! I hate going to restaurants that shamelessly charge over 5 bucks to microwave a box of kraft mac n cheese. Here, the mac n cheese and Alfredo pasta are made with real cheese. The sauces are rich and plentiful. The dishes are huge enough for an adult. My experiences here have always been consistently positive. Plus, the food at this location is superior to the Fashion Valley location. Sure, there's a waiter here I do not like but that won't stop me from coming to enjoy the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20,2.84,3.11,3.252,2.644,3.002

Unfortunately there were a few other aspects that were lacking. Firstly, when we had sat down, after I was told that while we were waiting our table just needed to be cleaned, I put my arm down on a sticky spot. Not the best but okay, I'll deal with it. I then tried to sit comfortably in the wicker chair and it was actually pretty bad. I was not able to sit up and had to recline way back in order to hit the back of the chair (I'm getting over a neck and back injury so this was particularly not fun throughout the meal). The 2 waiting staff members that helped us were very nice. Once we had our waitress, going through the menu and asking for help was easy, she was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered water to drink and the Cajun chicken poppers as my meal. The water was clearly tap and didn't taste great but our waitress did keep the glasses full excellently. My chicken was pretty good and there was a lot, but was not noticeably Cajun as the name implied (it was bland normal tenders). I was very happy the waitress was kind enough to add a side of gravy for the mashed potatoes but was disappointed when it wasn't white country gravy. The succotash was also good and spiced very well. By far the mediocre meal was made all the better when I had gotten the Nutella hazelnut cheesecake. It was delicious. The crisp flaky crust and rich Nutella with chocolate and topped with whipped cream was very good.

NO JOKE - 35 minutes into service. It was another 10 minutes before the manager came by to tell us one of the items we ordered was not available. My husband still didn't have his second beer at this point by the way -- about 3 minutes later his tacos arrived, and our appetizer (fried cauliflower) but no sign of the avocado toast. When the two dishes arrived I ordered my second beer *WHICH NEVER CAME* and was not surprised at this point that the food was cold. The ""hot spicy cauliflower"" was cold. The fish tacos rice/beans also cold. It was another 8 minutes before the avocado toast arrived. WHAT THE FUCK. I didn't even want it at that point but I was so hungry and thirsty I dove in. It was about another 5 minutes when the substitute salmon dish came out. My husband was done with his cold tacos. Our glasses were empty. I promptly asked a busser to get a box (for the cold cauliflower) and shortly after the server told me the keg had blown (which was TOTAL BULLSHIT because I saw two servers with multiple stellas walk away from the service well MOMENTS before she was table side.) 1 hour in and I still hadn't received my second beer. We were so unhappy with our experience we didn't even want to stay for dessert (truly the ONLY reason we chose this restaurant) and what's even more sad, I had to ask the manager to come over to explain our unfortunate situation and his reply was; ""well I took the salmon off I didn't realize how long you waited so hopefully that helps. happy anniversary.""

But it wasn't 30 mins we waited for almost 50 mins and watched as couples that came after us got seated. When i confronted a different hostess she that our names where not in the system which was irritating but wasn't as bad. What really got me was that the same male hostess looked at me numerous times and didn't say anything.  The food was not bad. I felt it was better back then but that's subjective. I ordered the mac and cheese burger and we had sweet corn pancake thing for an appetizer which was good but not great. Our waitress was ok she seemed a bit irritated but it was hectic and it's not like she lashed out, very timid and didn't smile. The service was ok.  The saving grace of this review is the Cheesecake. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and it was good. Not to crazy sweet and not bland at all.  This place wasn't bad and I'm willing to give it another shot but based off tonight this was probably not as great experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.

You can get a variety of different types of food here.  Pretty much can satisfy everyone in the family's cravings all at once... well maybe! There's even a ""skinny"" menu. The restaurant is a very nice fine dining feel. They box your food for you in to go boxes if you didn't finish. However I was a little disappointed today when I went to go eat my mashed potatoes I saved and the server I guess decided on his own I didn't need mashed potatoes and didn't give them to me! (Sad face!!!). Next time I'll have to box myself. Those mashed potatoes are obviously really amazing btw.

Our server took our drink order and left to input that into the computer  system. I proceed to follow her and tell her that it was my spouses birthday and if she could put happy birthday on her dessert plate and she told me yes and even told me it would be on the house (choice of cheesecake or a different dessert). I returned to my seat and a few minutes later the server returned with a different server and told us they are changing shifts and the new server would be taking care of us. New server stated that she got the drink order but didn't say the special desert order but I wasn't worried because I thought she didn't want to state that in front of my spouse. Spouse ordered chicken Alfredo, it had so much Alfredo sauce it looked like soup. She had to pour some out. Once dessert time came , we ordered the celebration cheesecake! She dropped off the desert and check at the same time , I was so upset that she didn't write nothing. After I explicitly told the previous server to write happy birthday!  We were still charged for the cheesecake. Extremely disappointed, will not be going back to this establishment anytime soon.

Her name isTheresa W.  And she works at the cheese cake factory at the Westfield Mall in Escondido. Why she works there is beyond me. She CLEARLY doesn't like her job. She hates her job. She doesn't want to be there but yet there she is. Unhappy, angry at the world and taking all that frustration and depression out on her customers.  She came to our table a total of 3 times our entire meal. I counted the times the people seated next to us had their waitress come to their table...... 11 times !!!  We got a refill of our drinks AT THE END OF OUR MEAL.  She asked if we wanted bread... Sure!!! 22 minutes later.... ""here's your bread"" and DROPS IT on our table and walks away. Ummmmmm where's the butter? Yummy dry bread.  Oh boy!! That's what I want. CHECK PLEASE!!!!  So we are done and we can't wait to get out of there..... tic tic tic 15 minutes later she shows up with the check. 15 minutes to print a check??? MAYBE she was having a bad day. MAYBE she had the flu. MAYBE her BOSS should do some training. MAYBE it's a management issue.  No one wants to be around a grump. People pay good money to have an enjoyable time. And get this..... the check has a suggested gratuity boldly right in the middle. It starts at 15%. We spent 75 minutes there. 30 minutes just waiting for her. A full HALF HOUR. Did we approach the manager about the issue? No... Why you ask ? Because we eat here monthly folks. Every month we watch other patrons complain to this shift manager and he does nothing except ARGUE back with the customers. We have always had normal to great servers but Theresa.......

I always end up going with some sort of pasta. If you like fried zucchini, I'd think Cheesecake Factory definitely has the best and it comes with a creamy ranch.

We were just sitting there and talking about how we can even make better food than this. Who is your chef Cheesecake Factory???  Took sooooo long to get a single cheesecake to go at the register by display that it was enough time to get upset about everything here.

Wearing comfy shoes is crucial.  The food offerings are identical to other restaurants within the chain. Don't expect ""local favorites"" or a menu that reflects the local demographic.

We like coming to The Cheesecake Factory for special occasions so we were very excited to come. Upon arrival, the lady who greeted us at the front desk was very kind and our wait time was shorter than expected.  However, the issues began when we got seated. To be quite honest, I was not impressed by the way the waitress treated my parents. I believe her name was Teresa. She was ""nice"" but it seemed very fake, like she was tired of her job. Since we were seated outside, my mother commented, ""I would just like to report that there are ants crawling around on the tables."" Her intention behind the comment was not for the staff to respond immediately, but to inform them to better help them in case they were not aware of this. In a sassy and annoyed tone, Teresa's response was, ""Well, we are sitting outside, so we cannot do anything about that."" and then she turned our back on us and walked back in.  Generally, I'm a pretty easy-going person and it doesn't take much for me be content with customer service, but I did not appreciate our waitress' attitude and tone. I understand that the job of a waiter/waitress is very demanding and they have to deal with annoying customers every single day, but I would appreciate a little more tolerance + grace. This really put a damper on my night.  On the bright side, the Godiva Chocolate Cake is amazing! But it would have been even sweeter had the waitress approached her job with a positive attitude.

On this particular visit me and my friends went to celebrate a friends birthday. (This is on a Thursday night at 6 and the wait time was only 10 minutes). We were quickly seated after putting our name down for a table and the waiter was very friendly. He took our orders and while we waited brought water and bread which we pretty much devoured because it's so good! And he also let us know in a timely fashion when our food would be ready so we weren't just left at our table wondering when we would get our food. When it all came out it looked great, although for my plate they forgot to cook angel hair pasta with the meal instead of the original pasta my order came with (I ordered the chicken Parmesan with pasta), so I asked the waiter if they accidentally mixed up my order and the waiter quickly took care of the problem and apologized and got me the correct order. Everything looked and tasted delicious! As I said our waiter was awesome! Unfortunately we forgot to get his name but if I ever get him again I'll edit this post with his name. He was a great help when we had questions, quick to get our food, helpful in getting my order right, and overall a great waiter! :)  Also, since it was our friends birthday we got the free treat that the Cheesecake Factory gives out, along with us all singing the traditional birthday song!

Limited vegetarian fare but we know that too.  The bread took some time coming and all the exuberance our server tried to rub on to us did little to mask the dampening the spirit feels towards the end if the holidays and a month of festivities.  The portions are humongous and ordering the lunch-size portions makes a lot of sense. A real food factory with a well worked out algorithm to serve over a hundred items.  We might return, them again we might not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2,2.6,2.76,2.932,,2.696
