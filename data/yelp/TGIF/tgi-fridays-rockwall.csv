Megan S.,"Dallas, TX",223,627,243,3.0,2/27/2010,"You know all that crap they have on the wall?  While I was admiring a full-size Rocky cutout in the other room, a piece of crap fell on my head.  Seriously.  It was the leg of a little toy hockey player.  Ouch.  It's not like it bruised or anything, but I didn't see it coming, and was really confused. Some manager came around, randomly, later on, and asked how things were.  We mentioned it, and gave her the leg back, and she apologized.  This is one of those cases, where I think if someone pitched a fit, they would have gotten a free something or other.  So, while I'm mostly ambivalent about the kick in the head from the hockey player, it would be nice- if being nice paid off, once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockwall
Laurey W.,"Rockwall, TX",117,19,,2.0,6/29/2010,"Met friends for lunch today at TGI Friday's - one of the poorest customer service experiences ever.  They do not offer Thousand Island dressing (???), the soup came out completely cold, and the salad croutons were stale.  The waitress acted put out when my friend asked for her soup to be replaced, even though she had ordered the endless soup and salad.   Our food took forever to arrive and we all ordered soup and salad (not sure why that would take long).  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockwall
