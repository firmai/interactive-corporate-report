Our hotel was right in front of this venue and me, being the lazy-ass I am, decided to just eat here (my biggest sin: knowing that Chipotle was a 5 minute drive). While the interior is surprisingly clean and somewhat accommodating, the food was overpriced, over-salted, and barely edible. The choose-2-for-$16.95 is a complete waste of money - the portions of the meats are so stingy. Avoid here like a plague, even if it's close to the hotel. There's In N Out & Chipotle nearby.

Mrs. C clearly ordered the best, with her pick 3 appetizers out of 8 or 9 items  I liked everything on her plate & should have ordered that.  I got the crispy chicken tacos with rice & beans which were ok, but pretty similar to something that I could have made at home with frozen chicken strips in a toaster oven & some tortillas.  However, the roasted corn guacamole was a huge serving & *excellent*.  Definitely getting this the next time I'm at a Chili's.

73,Marcus O.,"Barstow, CA",25,10,5.0,3.0,2015-01-11,"As a whole I'm disapointed with the brand. I don't like their menu changes - moving away from their casual Tex-Mex and going into a more trendy South-West. This has resulted in several menu casualties that my friends abd I enjoyed: RIP Buffalo Chicken Fajitas, Mushroom Burger, and Chicken Fried Steak. However, this review is based on this paticular restuarant. I gave it +1 for the service and a +1 for food taste; our server was friendly and attentive. He came a checked on us regularly which is rare for a Barstow joint. My group all got different burgers and they tasted acceptable, and all seemed to be going for a higher-end look but had an slightly better than average taste.  A reluctant +1 for cost: ranging from $9 to $12 for the burgers which is what you expect from casual dining digs for a ham-burgs - I'd still prefer to go to In-&-Out for my collin killing fix. However, I have to give a -1 for the mistake of basically giving us all the same burger: mine was a Sweet Smokehouse (or something like that) which came with Onion Rings, sauce, and cheese. Friend 1 got a Southern Smokehouse (not the same as mine) which was saposed to have bacon, cheese, and another kind of sauce. Friend 2 got a basic Cheeseburger with bacon. Instead, friend 1 got a cheeseburger with sauce and friend two got thr dame thing with bacon. Mine was fine. I know it sounds confusing but I read the descriptions of each item out of curiosity, and it matters because each burger had a different price so they all should have been unique. Our server comped us some onion rings to make friend 1's burger more Smokehousey so that worked.  It was busy which explains the mix-up, but professional cooks should still know the difference in their food.

The decor is trendier and now they have these kiosk tablets at all the tables where you are able to order food, check your Chili's account, play games, and pay for the food. I hate this little kiosk thing because it's so impersonal. We were able to order our food with the server but that's pretty much the only time we saw him. We had a difficult time catching the staff's attention to remove the massive amount of empty cups and dishes pilling up from our table. And when it came time to pay, you slide your cc through the kiosk and walk out. There's no need to wait for the check and the servers also don't bother to say goodbye either. But perhaps the detached service is exclusive to this one visit.  The Food: Nachos: Yes! I love how they put the cheese and toppings on each chip individually. This makes for a perfect and consistent bite.  Boneless Buffalo Chicken: No. Too vinegary and slightly dry.  Salmon: Delicious, highly recommended. Surprisingly very good.  Taco, enchilada, and tostada: Sorry, didn't do it for me. Flavors were all off.

This place is within walking distance of the hotel, so that's where I've been eating for an entire week now.  Staff:  mediocre. Michelle is awesome, but nobody else really takes the time to pay attention to you as a customer. If you've used their table side ""ziosk"" system to pay prior to your meal, forget amenities such as refills:  they already got their cash, and could not care less about you as a customer. Think that changes if they're empty?  Think again. I've walked out three days this week after the most bare bones service you could get from a sit down restaurant .  Food:  decent, depending on what you order. Made the mistake of ordering a steak the first day, and asked for it medium rare. It was served so grossly overdone and dry that old leather could be considered more tender. Started hitting the ""lite mex"" menu, and it's fairly decent. The chicken is a low quality but it's juicy and tender. The salmon has a decent flavor if you tell them not to cover it in their sugary sauces. The salads are crispy-ish, and the southwest chicken soup is yummy.  Overall, this place most likely stays open out of a combination monopoly in the area and all the outlet mall busses that saturates the area daily.

We vowed never to come back to this location! Fast forward about 5-7 yrs later and we're in the area again but don't want fast food. We decided to give them another chance and see if they could redeem themselves. This time the place was full but we got seated right away which seemed like a good sign already. We sit down and the hostess tells us the names of our 2 servers. We continue to sit and wait for either of these 2 people to show but nothing. Servers keep passing us and looking at our table but none of them stopped. Finally one of the guys that had looked in our direction multiple times already stopped and asked if anyone had helped us yet. We put in our drink and appetizer order in and waited some more. Once our drinks and appetizer came out he put them down and scurried off before we could ask for anything. No plates, no napkins, nothing to eat our appetizer with properly. When our food came out everything looked old and dry. My enchilada was hard and stale, to a point where I couldn't even cut it. My beans seemed to have a dried out layer like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. My kids' side of celery had brown spots all over them. Their cheeseburgers had no cheese. We asked for an extra plate so they could share but no one ever came back. Except for the times when our food and drinks were brought out, we never saw a server.

We started with the California grilled chicken flatbread. Boy was that great!! In addition to the grilled chicken, it had smoked bacon, tomato sauce, monterey jack and mozzarella cheese, and avocado. It was drizzled with roasted garlic aioli. A little spicy but not too much. Great way to start the meal. And it came out relatively fast so there was no delay and getting back on the road.

We got our order in, chips and guacamole came out right away (unfortunately the avocados were not ripe and my attempt at mashing them was not making them into guac). To top it off, they left the skin from the seed in there.  We finished our drinks after about 15/20 min of sitting there never to have our waitress return to offer a refill.  About an hour later the food comes out. Mind you, the salad I asked for, for them to bring out BEFORE the meal, never came!  The expediter asked if we needed extra plates to which we replied ""yes!"". And she NEVER returned.  Waited about 10 minutes and then asked for a manager.  The server we asked, returned and said the manager was coming right out. Another 8 minutes passes, still no manager. Oh, but good ol' Cindy has shown back up now and ready to fill our drinks.

2,Kimmie N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",62,96,733.0,4.0,2017-08-23,"We visit this restaurant on the way home from Vegas.  It was a great because it was next to the Tesla charging station, so we did not need to walk a far distance and was able to charge the Tesla at the same time.  I came inside first, it was pretty empty, I can only see one staff at the bar. I did not know if I seat myself or wait for someone. There were no signs or staff around. I walked to the bar and finally got the attention of the bartender. She said for me to wait and someone will seat me.  So I walked back by the podium and waited for the waitress to sit me. There are no hostess at this restaraunt. I sat down, and had my drinks ordered. The waitress was nice and sweet.  She took our order and then someone else brought out the food. People were going in and out. The restaraunt was empty and not full to capacity.  The food: I order the asparagus for appetizers and they were delicious. It was fried but it should not have been too fried because the esparagus was overcooked.  I received my Santa Fe salads and it was excellent. I really like the salad here. It was delicious.  My friend ordered me a Watermelon drink, it had vodka in it, but not too much ice. It was delicious as well.  When I was eating, I begin people come in and start seating themselves, they did not wait. I think this restaraunt needs to be more clearer about seating procedures instead of making me or other people chasing around a staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow,3.16,2.64,2.64,,2.8480000000000003
