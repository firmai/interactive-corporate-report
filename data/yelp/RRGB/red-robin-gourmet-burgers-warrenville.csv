Jana B.,"Naperville, IL",7,21,5,4.0,2/3/2015,"It was the first time I went there after they remodelled it. And I have to say I really like it. I have been there many times and I really like their burgers and fries. The staff there is super friendly and helpful and they have great customer service. I went there with a couple of friends once and my friend orderd a burger, but got a different one served. He only noticed it half way through (actually more than that :-)) and then mentioned it. They were so kind to give him his actual order for free to go, even though he basically ate the whole other dish. That was very nice. The only thing that would make it a 5 star rating for me is, if they had a different supplier for their guten-free buns. They are not so tasty and usually I get my burgers lettuce wrapped instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville
Derek P.,"Chicago, IL",92,99,60,3.0,10/16/2017,"For some reason, whenever my girlfriend and I are starving on a Saturday, every place nearby is busy except Red Robin's. We appreciate that it never seems to be truly busy. We got seated quickly, ordered quickly, and our food came at a reasonable time. Although, I ordered a shake and the waitress forgot it. Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our food, but said that we would want try new things next time. I had the Mac and cheese burger, and my girlfriend got some salad, u forget which one. One thing that irked me is that the waitress never asked me if I wanted a refill of bottomless fries. You already gave me a small amount, and of course I want to use this service! That kind of gets me angry.. I'd come here again, but I would hope the service would be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville

Our server, Alyson, was really nice and sped things along when we told her we were going to a movie at the Regal nearby. The spinach and artichoke dip was not that good, but the Mac and cheese was great. They split the entree for us without us asking which was nice.

Trina K.,"Chicagoland, IL",99,920,2433,3.0,12/21/2015,"This is a rounded up review.  Food - 3 stars  Service - 2 stars  When teens ask for burgers and fries after a long day of shopping, Red Robin was on the brain so we made a beeline to the closest one. Needless to say, they knew their order before we sat down or before we pulled into the parking lot. So, we ordered quickly.  One of them was relatively thirsty which means the lemonade was drank in no time. Our server said she bring another and never did. And we never received any water. The burgers arrived and I then noticed we were without a knife and napkins. Additionally, the person who dropped off the food noticed my sweet potato fries looked as if someone had eaten most before they were dropped off.  It took a bit longer for the lemonade refill, a while for a normal serving of fries. I ultimately walked over to the bar to get napkins and silverware on my own. After all, the food was getting cold.  You can use the screen at your table to pay for your meal which explains why service is sort of DIY. .... Perhaps a self fountain drink machine and utensil station are things to come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville

F B.,"Oak Park, IL",1,12,1,1.0,8/16/2017,"It's been awhile since I've eaten at Red Robin. It usually is our go-to place when my kids go with me to work. Today, I was fortunate to have a lunch date with my hubby and youngest son. We arrived at Red Robin at 12:20 pm to eat. The nice server got our order right away. Fast forward to 1:10 pm, and we still don't have our meal. 1:15 pm comes, my husband gets his meal. My order is not done correctly, my son's meal is not ready...AND it's chicken nuggets.  How hard is it to fry up some chicken nuggets.  I'm on my lunch from work.  I'm usually very patient because I use to be a server. But this is so ridiculous. At 1:20 pm, I just tell the server that we need to take it to go. 1:30 pm, still no chicken nuggets for my son, but my meal to go. We decide to leave. I know it was not the server's fault. The manager finally gets my son's nuggets. Our meal is comp'ed and he gives us a $25 gift card. What happened to this place? Thank goodness my oldest son wasn't with us, or I would've had to deal with an hangrier person. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville

Blair S.,"Wheaton, IL",1,71,,4.0,2/21/2017,"OK so I want to dislike the place because it's a bit of a family or kids themed restaurant chain. Not what we'd normally look for. But, the burgers are good! Every time I go there it's just,good. We went this past weekend and my 16 year old daughter said, "" we can't go there we don't have any little kids"". I said, I know, but we're going. Guess what, it was good again! Love the onion ring stacks to share, guacamole burger was great, I know it's cooler to dislike the Red Robin...but I can't, I like it. Only reason i can't give it a five star review is it's a tad bit expensive for fries and burgers. Three burgers, three drinks, and onion rings for,$60.00?

Mike M.,"Batavia, IL",2,25,,1.0,5/9/2016,"I walked in with low expectations knowing it was Mother's Day. I was a little overwhelmed with how little upkeep was going on during business. The floor had food food remnants all over the place. Service was good food was OK. The dessert was disgusting, it was donut croissants as best I can tell and they're deep-fried and onion ring oil. Nothing like having a nice sweet expectation and biting into onion. Upon leaving we discovered that my son had sat in something and the seat of his pants were covered and we don't know what. In following up with the manager we were given his business card and told we could come back with the receipt for the dry cleaning. I don't know what world he lives in or what kind of restaurants he's managed but that's not exactly the best method of dealing with this want to customers was food sucked and his clothes have been so oiled. While it was a nice gesture to pay for the clothes to be cleaned three Audi is certainly could've given something else such as a credit for our current meal and we would just take care of the dry cleaning. This method of sending us off to get dry cleaning receipt and come back for reimbursement is long past process and procedure and unacceptable practice in this day and age.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville

My fries were no up to par at all; they actually tasted old and stale.  I also tried the poutine fries (my 1st time) and they were extremely salty the cheese curds tasted as if they were frozen, and the gravy was weird.

Eric F.,"Naperville, IL",30,83,59,3.0,5/14/2015,"The perfect place to take the family after a screening of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.  Like that film, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers is uninspiring. Bland. In fact,  I'm having trouble working up any passion to write this review.  I did appreciate the thick burger-not something you can take for granted (See my review of Meatheads). I got a kick out of the black and white photo of a Greenwich Village street sign hanging on the wall. It was Bleeker Street,  two blocks from where my mother still lives. Ironically,  this restaurant is located in a little stretch of Warrenville wilderness that Mom would find positively soul-crushing.  The seats in the waiting area shaped like cheeseburgers made me laugh.

Thomas T.,"Irvine, CA",108,279,1,3.0,12/31/2013,"Red Robin is Red Robin, if you haven't been there, pretty much everything is good. I went during lunch and just stuck to the lunch menu, trying to keep my costs down, but still ended up paying 19 bucks. So be weary that there are cheaper options out there. On this occasion I got the chicken caesar wrap with clam chowder soup. Clam chowder was the one recommended by my server. I can't believe I'm complaining about this, but I thought it had too much clam. My other friend works at a different Red Robin and she said the chicken tortilla is their best one so I must try that next time. The wrap was good, had a burger the night before which is why I didn't get one this time and that was probably a dumb choice but oh well. Got the freckled lemonade which is why my total was bumped up to 19 but I think I got my moneys worth. Probably had about 3 of those which is good, but also bad with the amount of sugar that's probably in that bad boy.

My wife and I come here ever so often to get our crave. The appetizers are meh, and we usually pass on those, but the burgers are delicious. There is such a variety of toppings, buns, and sauces to choose from, its always exciting.  I usually get the whiskey river chicken sandwich and she is always getting something different. The service is fast, and I love the bottomless steak fries. They have a variety of sauces from black pepper ketchup, garlic mayo, campfire sauce, to name a few.  The drinks options are fun and always good. Use caution, they are very sugary and could easily open up the gates to diabetes. Lastly, its cheap. You're not over paying for what you are getting.

Now I know why they are so famous for their burgers and bottomless fries. My friend and I came here after doing some holiday shopping. We both got burgers which were good and I had the bottomless sweet fries and he had regular fries. Two things were off-putting about this place. First, the portion of fries that comes with the meal is small which leads people to ask for more. The second portion is almost three times bigger. The problem is when they ""run out of fries and need to make more."" My friend waited about 30 minutes until we decided to leave. He is still waiting for those fries. The second problem was the waitress, Kimberlee. She was horrible. She was absent and when I asked about the elusive fries she snapped at me.

My husband always orders a burger and is usually happy with his order but I like to try something new each time--which I guess is a mistake since I rarely ever have anything good (their poutine was godawful when they had it). The only consistent thing has been their onion rings. But on several occasions we have ended up scoping out other tables for condiments because the one we had was empty and our waitress is nowhere to be found. The last time we were there we were given no utensils or napkins, and again the waitress was MIA.

What can I say? - Unlimited fries, check. - Whiskey River Burger with fried onion strings, check. - Free burger for my birthday, check. - Great service, check. - Awesome BBQ sauce, check. - Freckled lemonade for the husband with free refills, check. {*total ripoff, but sometimes he's a sucker for that sort of thing.} What's not to love? I am seriously convinced that this place has the best burger setup of anywhere I've been lately! I'm not even kidding. My husband also had an Oktoberfest burger with dijon-covered sauteed onions, ham, romaine, burger patty, swiss cheese on a brioche (pretzel) bun. So incredible.  The prices are a bit high, but you get unlimited fries and they always seem to have freebies if you're into that! We attempted to hit up the Wheaton location and BAM, the sign on the door said, closed! They closed the day before FOR GOOD! Off to Diehl we went.

Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1525,2754,3.0,10/4/2011,"The burgers are nothing particularly special, but the ingredients are pretty fresh and I was able to pick out the different flavors of the bacon, guac and onion atop my order. It was done exactly how I requested - Guacamole Bacon Burger with Onion Straws, medium rare, slightly pink in the middle and a side upgrade from regular Fries to Sweet Potato Fries. I enjoyed it; I didn't LOVE it. I did love that even with the upgrades and a giant, strong Mai Tai that I only paid $20. So while I still prefer Smashburger for a burger, I can only get beer there. Red Robin has a full bar and the Tiki Drinks are affordable ($7 or less). We asked our waitress which drinks had the most booze in them. It was one of those nights.

It's a burger loaded with onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes, and BBQ sauce. The one thing I love about Red Robin is their steak fries because they are bottomless, meaning, free refills on the fries.

Jonathan S.,"Naperville, IL",0,1,,1.0,4/12/2016,"I went to this place in the January of 2015. My experience was so bad that I felt compelled to come here and post it as a review over a year after the actual experience. Here's what happened: 2 friends and I (~26 years old) show up for lunch on a Sunday to get some burgers, drinks and watch a Blackhawks game. When we arrive, we are seated in the closest booth to the door despite a mostly vacant atmosphere (two or three 40-50 year old groups). Like I mentioned, it is January so we have quite the draft coming through and are very uncomfortable. The server comes over and we all place our drinks order (3 beers and 3 waters) and an order for an onion appetizer, as well as ask for them to put the Blackhawks game on. Our server says they will comply to the hockey request and process the order.  15 minutes pass and we have received no drinks or food. We contact the server again and repeat the order, as well as the TV request. About 5 minutes following this re-order and subsequent apology, we are served our appetizer. We start to eat, but quickly all get thirsty and realize we have no drinks. Also, the Blackhawks game has started while SportsCenter remains the viewing program on all TVs. The server comes back around for round 3 and this time we start asking questions: 'where are our drinks?' (we are so thirsty) 'what happened to the Blackhawks game?' (score of game scrolls by on bottom line). As we are asking questions, another server comes up to our current server and asks if current server needs help. He insists everything is all and well and that he needs no help. He leaves the table without saying anything to us.  Somehow the bartender gets the message to make the beers, pours all 3, and leaves them on the counter to be served. The next 10 minutes are brutal, mainly due to our extreme thirst. We still have not received waters or beers, and we can actually see the beers sitting on the counter across the restaurant. Our server is just bouncing between the other 2-3 tables and has completely forgot about us, for the third time. While this is going on, the bartender realizes these beers have been poured for 8 minutes but not served. The head of the beer has dissipated and the beer glasses look 2-3 oz empty as a result. I will never forget what happens next; the bartender puts straws in the beers and stirs them so that foam will be reproduced, and to make the beers look full once again! Quite hilariously terrible actually. I tell this part of the story all the time because this is such a heinous act - destroying a poor beer to make it look full again.  We flag down our server for the 4th and final meeting. He arrives and asks, ""Can I take your order?"" We almost burst out laughing. ""No thanks. We will just take a check for the onion."" He now realizes that we have been there for 30 minutes and have received no drinks (waters are nowhere to be seen... at least we saw the beers). He looks back at the stirred beers and asks if we want them. We kindly suggest that we do not want the beers any longer. He goes through apology round #2, we tell him its OK, he gets the check, and we leave to go to Chipotle on the way home. I've never bought a drink from Chipotle for a to-go order before but I did on this occasion due to the whole thirst situation from the Red Robin. The Chipotle was great per usual, but just could not make up for the extreme thirst, lack of entertainment, and overall poor experience that I received going here. I give this one star instead of 0 because it made for funny restaurant horror stories over the past year. Never again going to a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=40

They try to be inventive with their burgers...that's great, but only if you don't replace taste with inventiveness. They do.

Rick F.,"Naperville, IL",0,27,,1.0,6/24/2015,Absolute worst experience ever. I ordered food at 9:40 I showed up at 9:50 and the doors were locked so I started knocking as employees walked past and stared at me. The door said open until 10pm. I reached in my pocket to call and realized my phone was in the car. So now I walked back to my car got my phone and my first call was at 9:55 there phones were turned off. Hmmm so now I have two choices leave with out the food or stand and knock on the door that should be opened. Finally some one opened the door with an attitude like a what do you want attitude? I got my food and and asked for a manager. I asked why you would lock the doors before close when you knew someone was picking up their food. His reply was I just locked the door and our phone was not off. I called him on speaker and the phones were certainly off. He also said I knew you where coming because I made the food myself. Which was a direct indication he was unhappy with my late order. I did not know what time they closed and if it was such a nuisance they shouldn't take the order and close earlier. I wasn't planning on complaining about my experience until I got home and realized the order was not right probably because they cleaned up the kitchen early and did not want to get things dirty. The manager was rude and wanted to argue than apologize.

Tessa G.,"Naperville, IL",91,95,48,4.0,2/20/2012,"I have always been a fan of Red Robin. In High School, which isn't too far behind, I visited this location NUMEROUS times before and after movies. It is one of my favourite chain restaurants and I have always been satisfied. For some odd reason, I went without Red Robin for a good 4 years. I have recently changed that. This location is always clean, fast paced, and friendly. I went here two times within two weeks about a month ago. GUILTY. The two times were on weekend night (Fri/Sat). The first Friday visit had a very short wait and we were given fast and friendly service. I tend to get the Crispy chicken tender salad, which should always be accompanied by the sweet poppyseed honey mustard dressing. This salad is effing huge. It's like, excessive. I remember back in the day when they were little sweetie pies and had half sizes available for this salad. This was righteous; I consumed just as much, more was gone from my plate, and I was paying less. Oh well, now I'm forced with a true battle each time it arrives. Me versus 'THE SALAD!. You could split anyone of their salads. I am head over heels for the little bread squares they give you along side of the salad. Of course, the biggest downside to this is that you don't get those delicious bottomless steak fries that come with numerous menu items, you will have to order these separately. PLEASE, ORDER THEM, then pick up that cute little bottle called ""house seasonings"" and sprinkle a bit on top. You will dig it. Their burgers are good, but I've only had bites of the burgers that belonged to the past people I have gone with. Blue Ribbon Burger and Whiskey River BBQ stand out most to me and would be the ones I'd order for myself. I love their clucks and fries and they are often my next choice if I don't get my salad. If I get the clucks and fries, I get a cup of their tortilla soup which is delicious. Oh, that huge onion ring stack? Are there three people at your table? Good talk, ORDER THEM.  Their freckled lemonade is also a divine option, along with most other drinks on their menu that includes some sort of pureed deliciousness at the bottom of the beverage. The problem? That it is like $5...I don't know, that's just too much for me to pay for something like that. Knock that down to $2.50 and you've got yourself a deal. Overall, I end up throwing Red Robin into the mix here and there when trying to conjure up restaurant ideas. If you're in the area before a movie and want some American Fanfare, snag a bite. You better not forget your balloon on the way out. Common, there is no age limit on balloons, don't feel sheepish, grab your favourite colour and get outta there!

Josie M.,"Aurora, IL",5,79,12,1.0,10/17/2009,"This review really isn't about the food at Red Robin; the food is good for what it is, a slightly overpriced chain restaurant. However, this particular location SUCKS.  We've been here a lot of times, and while most of the time the service is at the very most adequate, the last few times I have been awful. The food always comes out quickly, but fat chance getting your server to come back to refill your drink, or get you some more ranch or ketchup. It's always freezing, and a lot of the booths come loose while you sit in them.   The last time we were there, I chose a new thing to order, which was the sirloin sliders, and after two bites, realized this was a mistake. It came with these fries that had cheese and were DRENCHED in oil. After waiting for at least 10 minutes for my server to come back to my table, I asked if I could have something else, and my server sent over the manager. He was nice enough and offered to replace my meal with something else. My server seemed worried that the manager was at my table, and proceeded to give us attitude the rest of the time we were there. We were seated next to the bar, and heard at least 4 different servers comment on how I didn't like what I ordered, and how if I didn't like it, I shouldn't have ordered it. It was extremely rude and unprofessional, and while I don't expect much, I do expect for me to eat my damn food without hearing about how dumb I for attempting to eat something new. I wouldn't recommend this location, but the one in Wheaton is pretty sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
Tania M.,"Elgin, IL",29,124,34,4.0,6/10/2007,"I think this location is way better than the one in Wheaton. You can also dine outside on their patio which is nice if you want to get a way from all the commotion inside. My latest craving has me coming here for their California Chicken Burger. Overall I have not been disappointed with any of their burger selections. If you are ordering an appetizer, go with their Spinach Artichoke dip...creamy delicious! Service is very friendly and prompt at this location and lately I have been coming here about once every two weeks, just to get my fill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
Angela U.,"Berwyn, IL",121,270,52,4.0,7/14/2008,"I like this place, it is casual. The bottomless soft drinks and fries are great, don't find that too many places right now. The decor is great, I love all the artsy pieces with the burgers and robins.  Food was tasty, Waitstaff was great.  I will definitely go back to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
Celeste C.,"Bellevue, WA",35,224,5,2.0,3/12/2007,"Went here when my in-laws came to visit. Tons on families here on a Saturday night. So many in fact that they had ran out of high chairs!! When we did get one the straps where broken, my daughter thought it was great to stand up!! The fries were great. They did mess up our (my father in laws and mine) order. By the time the correct version came out I was full on fries.  Not really crazy about going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80

James C.,"Naperville, IL",1,32,3,1.0,9/15/2013,"We used to eat at Red Robin weekly but the food quality and management has been getting worse over the last 2 months.  I had the fish and chips, my wife had a burger and my 5 yr old ordered Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was warm around the edges and ice cold and very watery in the center. She only took one bite. My wife's burger was fine but half of my fish was raw. I spoke to the manager and asked if they put a piece of ice in the Mac and cheese to cool it off as I explained our problem. He said they would never do that on purpose then got very defensive and kept repeating that it would never happen ""on purpose.""  No replacement or remedy was offered. RR used to be great about correcting any issues, especially with kids meals. Very disappointed with this location and it's management. Our server, Fonzie, yes Fonzie, was nice but couldn't find the manager after the food came out and we noticed the floating macaroni in ice water. On our way out we saw the manager outside chatting and laughing with another employee. Must be a franchise location because corporate would never let this happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
Jessica D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",161,817,56,4.0,7/19/2007,"Bright locale, ready to fill you up with their unending french fry basket and lots of other delectable goodies that taste good! Can be a bit loud, lots of young people. An excellent location for a group or a date before a movie next door. They used to carry a special gift card packet that included two tickets to Cantera and one of their gift cards -- not a bad deal at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
Nelson S.,"Chicago, IL",14,208,11,3.0,8/30/2006,"Definitely a family oriented restaurant, kids in every nook & cranny.  This place is decent if you have to go.  Personally, this wouldn't be my first choice but the food is alright.  Was never a fan of their burgers so I usually get some kind of chicken sandwich and have been pleased.  I do like their fries and when you get refills, that is more than enough.  I think their drinks then to be on the weak side so I usually get beer.  I don't hate the place, but I don't love it either, I'll go if someone else wants to go.  So, yeah...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80

Summer R.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,,4.0,3/14/2008,"Great spot to take the kids!   It's usually noisy and crowded at peak hours so your younger family members don't have much of an opportunity to disturb other patrons (unless they are really out of control and then it's time to leave anyway).    The kid's menu is pretty good and it is nice to dine where there are other families. I opt for one of the wraps - a chicken bbq thing and my husband goes for the burger.  We are both satisfied, full and always order the same thing next time.  Wait staff is always cordial and friendly.   Last waitress was a bit young and green but she gave 110% and we were fine with that.  Free balloons for the kids is a great way to keep them happy!   One of our favorite places to stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=80
