Lindy C.,"College Station, TX",0,18,,4.0,5/30/2013,I'm actually sorry to see them go.  I really liked their Strawberry Fields Salad.  In spite of the other reviews I had consistently good food and service here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station
Greg D.,"College Station, TX",3350,3290,41724,1.0,5/28/2013,"And another one bites the dust.   (C) Queen.   Well surprise!   George Carlin actually touched on the eventual demise of these and I quote ""Places with cutesy names.."" like TGI Fridays and the list goes on.   Applebees, BJ's, it's all the same lab designed sodium laced garbage with some alcohol to wash it down.   Yeah, the party is over here.   Went by yesterday and it's boarded up.   Now what will I do with my E-Coupon? YEAH!   One less place peddling sodium laced junk food.   See, if you have time or care to read my review back in 2009, TGI FRYDAYS!  (Sorry, can't get George Carlin's voice out of my head) was one of the last remaining companies in the US to refuse to disclose to their consumers how much sodium was in their food.   That's why I quit eating there.   And quit eating at Chili's, and Applebees and the latest incarnation of sodium poison disasters to grace mall parking lots, BJ's.   It's all the same.   Now, this sodium and alcohol giant with a good location on University Drive, the gateway to Texas A&M University where it was convenient for obese America's parents to eat with their Ashley's, Brittanys, Megans, Kyles and Bryans on rare weekends they were in town to visit their college kids, what's up with Applebees?   After all, Applebees serves the same crap, and is kinda hidden off behind some construction on Texas Avenue.    I'll predict that the bell is gonna toll for Applebees soon.   I hope so. And the ultimate sodium and alcohol vendor, Chili's.....    Feel bad for the people that lost their jobs because I liked the kids at TGI Fridays.  But in an economy when eating out calls for more educated choices, these salt like snake oil places need to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station
Eric W.,"Paragould, AR",6,247,272,3.0,4/13/2010,"Typical chain TGIF - I didn't find anything grungy about it at all.  Was here just last Sunday getting into town for business.  I typically get the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta, which is usually good, but here it was a little off.  Pasta slightly overcooked, too much garlic (and I like garlic), and the chicken was cut flat with the grain, which meant I had to cut it into edible pieces.  Most TGIF's will cut it into thin strips against the grain so it falls apart nicely with a fork.  The pot stickers were ok as usual.  They had Stella on tap which is always nice.  4 TV's above the bar with various games, etc.   You could definitely do worse for a meal and a beer, although I have never been a big fan of much else on their menu.  No wifi at this one.  Service was fine for a chain, nothing special but not inattentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station
Scott D.,"Houston, TX",73,171,150,1.0,8/11/2009,I walked into this TGI Friday's and immediately headed back out the door. The place smelled rancid. Something was very wrong. The smell sticks with me as though embedded in my nostrils until the end of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station
kittryn N.,"College Station, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2011,Can easily say everything was crap. The wait staff took at least half an hour to take our order. Which we had ready about 2 minutes after we got our drinks. The food was bland or had to much salt and later both me and my friend got bad cramps from the food. Not necessarily food poisoning level just bad food possibly crappy preservatives and MSG. Go somewhere else. Its not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-station
