Dean O.,"Vail, AZ",3,9,,5.0,5/25/2017,"I've been to this location a few times recently. The service has always been adequate. I hadn't been to Applebee's since the revamp, but I am pleasantly surprised at the new menu. I think the nachos are the best ""chain store"" nachos I've ever had. I've yet to be disappointed by the food. They use strip tortilla chips for nachos and dipping. That's huge to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Andrica D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",60,53,12,2.0,4/1/2017,Well I wasn't a huge fan of this place.  My steak was dry and so were our ribs.  The staff was nice. We did get a appetizer(boneless wings) those were good. I should have gotten those for a meal. The food is way overpriced for what they serve.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Lori R.,"Yukon, OK",0,28,38,1.0,4/10/2017,"Terrible service! We were seated promptly and given drinks however 30min went by before we our waiter came back to the table to inform us, ""there was a mix-up"" in the kitchen and our food would be at least another 10min. Meanwhile he chatted with a couple at the table behind us. They were having a conversation about how trashed the guy was last time they saw each other, very professional. Can't review the food because we got up and left. Don't waste your time! Mustang has too many good food options now , move on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Clayton H.,"Mustang, OK",62,1,,2.0,3/12/2017,"Took forever to get my Long Island Ice Tea, the appetizer came to me cold, the steak came to me with good flavor but cold, the sides were cold. I would have spent a lot more money but the service was slow, they didn't give me a chance to spend more. The manager made it right. And the bar tender did a great job on the drinks but it took forever for the waitress to get them to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Tony R.,"Mustang, OK",22,38,67,2.0,2/15/2015,"This is the second time I've been here and I really wanted to give them a good review but it's just mediocre at best. I had a burger and you would think they wouldn't be so stingy with the lettuce, tomato and onion for the price they charge. The waitress seemed more interested in giving people their takeout orders than waiting on her customers. Don't worry I left her a decent tip anyway. I probably would have gave 3 stars if my drink would have been refilled. If I have to go back I won't order a burger. Tip; Don't be seated by where they pickup the takeout orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Angela P.,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",69,415,2,2.0,5/2/2015,"Yikes. Well, not great. The customer service was very good and my specialty drink was was great as well. It kind of ended there. Our potstickers were sad and dry/doughy. It was like someone had forgotten to actually fry them. My rare burger came out well done and falling apart. It looked like someone had hacked it up and tried to mush it back together. Totally weird. Overall, not a very impressive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Elizabeth L.,"Mustang, OK",7,1,,1.0,3/28/2015,Terrible.   Ordered a salad to go - when I got home Opened box to find only lettuce and dressing.  Waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Jason B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",56,310,13,4.0,8/6/2015,"I have been here at least a half dozen times and had great service every time. The food was always hot and tasted very good. This is by far the best Applebee's that I have eaten at. In fact, this is the only Applebee's that I will eat at. I have had bad experiences at some of the other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mustang-2
Emma B.,"Mustang, OK",0,3,,5.0,1/21/2016,"First I gotta say I HATED applebees (notice past tense) , but, since the change in menu I have to say, applebees has stepped up their game. I personally enjoy the handhelds, and since they aren't really a steak house I can't penalize them for their okay but not wonderful steaks. I truly think they have improved, (at least the one in mustang has) and will continue to visit for the occasional light lunch.
