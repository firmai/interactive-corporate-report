356,Marianne r.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,,5.0,2012-01-17,"mariann r. This place was great and very affordable!! We live in the neighborhood, and we finally tried it last night. The place was very crowded, but we only waited 10 minutes for a table. The service was wonderful, and the food delicious. We had burgers, ribs, and shrimp. All entrees were very generous portions, and came with sides. My family and I will definitely be going back there!!  The atmosphere is geared for young people. For me it was a little too dark in there, and the music was a little too loud.

I went the first time during the summer and i thought the outside patio was nice with a pretty view. If I would only go there for the view would be great but the food is terrible. The ribs have no meat in them, there are greasy and burned. The steak was so dry and tasteless. Anyhow after my fist time, I thought i would give them a second chance before i can create a full opinion, I went there again this winter and it confirmed my first impression to NEVER GO THERE. The only good thing there are the french fries and the burgers are ok. The portions have become so small, the appetizers are dry, the fried shrimp is all bread. I would never go back.

When she attempted to be nice I could still sense sarcasm. The food wasn't the best. But the thing that turned me off the most was the fact that we asked her if we could use the optimum card for the 20% discount. Instead of explaining that it would be better to not use the discount because of the ""3for"" deal she said nothing and we almost ended up paying an extra $30. Very despicable.

347,Ann S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1.0,1.0,2014-05-03,"I have been to this Fridays quite a few times but never have I had an experience like today. I really wish that you can put zero stars but because of the food it made a star. Where do I begin... The hostess wasn't ready for her position because a table for two shouldn't be waiting for more than an hour and the fact that she was really confusing people who were on and weren't on the waiting list. I overheard the new hostess was bashing her fellow employee. The hostess was carrying on and on, I finally got fed up asked how much longer is my wait. I was told that ""There are mad people ahead of you."" The way she spoke was very unprofessionally and her attitude wasn't professional at all. I believe if I heard her name correctly it was Jasmine. After waiting even longer we were finally seated and meet our waiter Mike. I was felt kinda bad for the Mike only because it's opening week and things seem to be hectic. We order our drinks and appetizers right away. We were waiting for 30 minutes just for our drinks. During that time we were waiting for the drinks I was told the drinks are coming soon that they punch into the machine.  Another employee came up to us while we were waiting for our drinks asked us if we needed service.  Not to mention after we had gotten our drinks, our appetizers come out 40 minutes later. Our drinks consist of a ridiculous amount of ice. You were able to sip a small amount and not really enjoy it only because of the amount of ice. Once our appetizers were cleared, I asked our waiter for water. And as time passed I notice the table next to me wasn't having a good time either. I overheard the gentlemen complaining about his plate isn't what he ordered. 45 minutes later our entrees come out followed by the two,glasses of water I order 45 minutes ago..I have to say that the food was very good. However I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible just because waiting to eat for two hours really tick me off  and the service was AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320,3.24,3.24,3.24,1.8600000000000003,3.2400000000000007

16,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,2.0,1.0,2014-05-04,"Recently reopened, I ventured out on a Saturday night to eat before seeing a movie with friends. The service was slow, the servers themselves seemed to have no idea what they were doing or what was even on the menu and my beer order was screwed up twice. The food, however was still on par. Thinking this was a just due to a busy Saturday night, I simply let it pass.  However, as I type this, I am back today with my family. And there is no mistake, these servers have no idea how to be professional. They were all standing around watching a basketball game, it took 20 minutes just to get two beers and a seltzer. We asked the waitress for a ginger ale, only to find out 30 minutes later there is no ginger ale. We asked if they had juice, orange to be specific. The waitress tried to offer us a lemonade or Cherry coke. We just wanted orange juice. Simple. Another waitress finally got us our OJ.  Now the food, the wings are still good and there is no way to screw up a salad. But the burgers were doused in salt and undercooked. And the chicken was charred and as hard as a Hockey Puck. The waitress  just admitted that the cooks are ""still learning in the kitchen."" How can you get a job as a cook if you don't know how cook!? Atleast they didn't screw up my beer order.  Until the managers lock down a decent wait staff and kitchen, I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=180,3.16,3.16,3.16,1.8600000000000003,3.1600000000000006
338,Julian L.,"New York, NY",197,6,7.0,4.0,2014-05-05,"Ahh at last our local TGIFriday is back up and running after about a year and a half since hurricane sandy destroyed nearly the whole sheepshead Bay Area. But as usual there will be pros and cons to a restaurant.  Let's start off with the pros shall we? First the entrance to the place was a warm welcome with a red carpet rolled out and many greeters at the door. Maybe it's due to the grand reopening? I'll be back updating things in a few weeks. As you walk in bathroom is to the right and a little more forward you will see a newly designed bar. And if you just turn your head to the left of the bar you will see the kitchen or part of it through the window. Been seeing this in many tgifridays now, maybe new design for all to update to? The overall design is very modern and up to date. Anyways let's move onto the goodies the FOOOOOD. Ever since my last time there the food was quite the same maybe just a bit smaller portion. Starting with apps we choose the combo with crispy green bean fries, potato skins with cheese and bacon, and buffalo chicken wings. Small plate but surprisingly filling already. Should feed about 3-4 people max. Moving onto entrees I ordered the Jack Daniel Combo and that's were we ran into trouble but later to be mentioned. In the combo I choose the chicken and 6oz sirloin which will fill you up if you had the apps and this together. Now other people on my table ordered the 2 for $16/$12 combo where you choose an app and entree. Your choices are limited but it will still fill you. But now to the cons. Sadly to say on the day that I went (5/5) they had to 86 all ribs on the menu due to a party that morning that sold out the ribs. I was looking forward to it but until next time. Another con is that it took forever to be seated though they try to squish 7 people into a 5 people booth which I think it wasn't smart and we waited for another table to be opened. ALWAYS CALL AHEAD OF TIME BEFOFE GOING THERE TO RESERVE SEATS!  Lastly shoutouts to the terrific staff that made our meal enjoyable. First with the seating, they asked if we liked it first and when we didn't they would go look for another one. Secondly throughout the whole  meal not only out server asked how it was going; others like manager and other servers asked as well. Which I think it was something I haven't seen in many restaurants.  Though this is still a new restaurant; things may change and the review may not be accurate as the opening past. But hope it will stay with all the pros and fix the cons! So try it out won't be a waste of your money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=260,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.16,3.1600000000000006

About another 45 minutes go by, and she says sorry, again, would you like to order.  So we ordered the Spinach Dip, and Pretzels with some kind of a dip.  While waiting for our Apps, some worker streaked by, dropped chips and salsa, and ran off like he was being chased by the cops.  355 Brittany saw that, and asked us why he dropped that off there?  I said; damn good question.  So, she took it away, and who knows where that went. Apps, finally come, but with no dipping sauce for the pretzels.  So, we asked for some, and she said; oh would you like to order some.  We said, no it's supposed to come with it, look at the menu.  So, she said; oh, okay.  I'll order you some.  (IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT OUR DRINKS, IT'S ONLY YOU AND 355 BRITTANY.)  So, after about 15 minutes of waiting for the sauce, we asked AGAIN for the sauce, and our drinks.  She said; oh, your drinks are at the bar.  She brought those, but still no sauce.  Finally, we asked for the check and told her to forget the sauce.

TGIF serves up some dishes that are a lot tastier than their competitors in my opinion (i.e. Applebee's, Chili's, etc). This location reopened recently after being closed for over a year due to Hurricane Sandy and I just tried it out the other day. Unlike most other users' reviews, I thought the service was great (most likely because I came during lunch hours when the crowd wasn't nearly as busy as dinnertime). The food, however, was very MEH. Not as yummy as it used to be. I ordered an appetizer of the fried green beans with a wasabi sauce, and while the green beans were good, it tasted like they were sitting out for awhile. The breading was soggy and overall disappointing. For my main course I ordered the chicken fingers which were tasty, but dry. I had to drench them in the honey mustard to make them more tolerable. The side of fries weren't great either, as they were overcooked. I'll come back to this place again, I'm sure, but the other TGIF locations serve up much better food than this one.

This visit somewhat exceeded my expectations. Came here on a Friday night around midnight with a party of four, told that wait time was about 20 mins, but was seated within 10. #winning. Waitress was very nice (Zenath), very busy, poor soul looked like she was managing 3/4ths of the whole spot, but was very attentive. Decor of the spot upgraded from a former-hole in the wall to a more modern lay out. I was so impressed I forgot that I was at Friday's. But then the food reminded me where I was. I mooched off of my friend's appetizers, and no matter what they ordered the salt intake was borderline hypertensive crisis, everything was fried to the bone, and the alcoholic drinks counteracted the saltiness by giving you diabetes with their sweetness. Regardless, still a nice hangout spot, and as long as your blood pressure and glucose levels can hang, you can deal with the food and drinks. Drinks: The Island Rum Punch is better than the other Rum punch option (it's less sweet as a juice and more Rum-tasting), the berry drink was also good.

Wait some more. Oh, look, there they are! Finally they take down your order, give you an attitude, and try to (horrendously) up-sell you.  If you want water, you need to call the manager over so they can tell your server to do their job.  If you want your bill, you might as well take that 20-minute catnap while you wait.  In general, if you want anything, well, good luck with that. I hate tipping poorly, but man, they are just that bad.  If yelp enabled me, I'd give them a -4 (+1 star for their generic chain food).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=140,1.84,2.2,2.2,1.7000000000000002,2.056

185,Imagine D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,27,,5.0,2015-03-23,"I decided to give this specific location a try about 4 times before I wrote this review. Yes I still decided to give this place a try although I saw that it had extremely poor ratings across, Yelp, Google and its counterparts for reviews - I know, I know, only a loon would do that, right? Well I am a little nuts....about Brooklyn anyway! So because I didn't want to lose hope in my native borough and not believe the saying that all good food & entertainment is across the water in Manhattan.      The first time I went with my Fiance and son. I didn't feel like cooking so I thought it would be a great chance to go there for dinner. This was about 8-ish. We had a waitress that was very friendly, helpful and quick with pushing food out of the kitchen. She made sure our cups stayed full and she suggested drinks and appetizers when we were a little indecisive. This was before the endless apps craze so we wanted something shareable and we were not disappointed with the potato skins. We were so happy with her service we gave a generous tip and vowed to return.     The second visit was with my fiance only and it was a spot we chose to try again for lunch. We figured that since it was a Thursday afternoon and we both were free until our son's dismissal at school it was a great opportunity to see how lunch service was. We arrived about 12-ish and was seated immediately because it was a ghost town in there, aside from a few elderly members who probably seeped out from the neighboring retirement complex a block over for some afternoon coffee or soup and one or two fathers out with their little girls for a daddy & daughter lunch which I thought to be too adorable. At this time the endless apps had started and our waitress told us about what our choices were so we settled on two apps and some sort of rum concoction cause we figured 12pm equals 5pm somewhere. Anyway the food came out quick but the drinks took forever to come witch I don't understand when the bar population including the bartender was 2. We had a birds eye view of the bar and it was empty! We asked about our drink and the space cadet said ""Oh I didnt bring your drink? I know it was made. OOOhh there it goes *points at bar* I left it over there. I knew I had them. I'll make you fresh ones""....smh She got $1 tip from us. No way should we have sat down in the 12th hour and not leave after 3. Despite that we returned cause We didnt want to count this place out because of one dingle berry.  Since that visit^^^^^^^ management has changed, they've hired a slew of new people and service had in fact improved. Ive gone a lot of times since the afternoon disaster including the time where management tried to end the endless app which we complained to the new manager about and he apologized and removed a few bucks to sooth our unhappiness cause in fact thats what we drove down there for - the apps special! The last time I have been here was two weeks ago and I observe how well then staff works together, service is better than ever, food always come from the kitchen hot, Im not seeing revolving wait staff like the first few times so I hope thats indication management is much better this time around. I do recommend this place. I dont understand the poor ratings. I have had only good service here except that afternoon ding bat. Otherwise its been good. I give it 5 stars. Super friendly staff, just treat them like people, not the help. Maybe they will respond to you better you 3 star givers and rememer this is TGI fridays not chateau Leraunt or whatever foo foo service you expect - they sell bufalo wings not caviar!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=280,1.84,2.16,2.16,2.164,2.032

I think telling people they have to wait an hour for their food after waiting 30 min to be seated will still get them mad. We waited because we were starving and we got our food in 20 to 30 min.

I arrived at Fridays 30 after the order and still on hold, I kept the line open. I was told that my order was never put it. It was written but never entered. I asked to speak to the manager, the funny thing is that one manager finally gets on the phone to assist me another is there standing with me in the restaurant.  I informed the manger that I was in the location already after being on hold for over 30 minutes. They felt embarrassed. To make a long, bad experience short...they said they wouldn't rush my order....I stayed there another 40 minutes.  One manger told me because it was Fathers's Day and it was busy that why this happened.  If I came on a Monday, my experience would have been great.

Came here to celebrate my daughters birthday after the movies - figured it would be easy walking across the street gave them a day notice that I was bringing a big party - nothing was done to accommodate us - waitress was annoyed by our presence! Didn't want to take the order from the kids wanted me to give it to her - food took forever - no plates given for apps had to get up & get them myself from the station - no one bussed the table leaving us with a mountain of dirty dishes on the table while our meal was being served - took 20 minutes to get a drink - never checked on by our waitress & when I tried to get her attention she waved me off as if I wasn't important enough! Thank u for ruining what should have been a fun lunch for my daughters birthday. Manager did what she could to ease the tension of the situation but damage was already done!!

I questioned the hostess and she had no explaination but to say that they were a party of 5, so i guess my party of 4 couldnt fit in that table.  She didn't have any resolution to the problem, She then gave me the number to the GM, which I called and got no answer, and to top it off this must be the only GM without a answering service so I couldn't leave a message .  We left the place discussed , angry and very disappointed.

298,Sindy M.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",39,11,9.0,1.0,2015-10-11,"Tonight was absolutely horrifying that a corporate franchise can be so unfriendly, uncaring, no customer service, lack of integrity and no respect for the customers needs. 1. No plates for our five people eating appetizers. We were treated like wolves. We eventually got plates 15 minutes after everything was cold. 2. Explaining you need a glass of ice water that you have to beg another waiter for is unacceptable. A simple thing like water? 3. Our waitress whom name was Asha refused to comply during our time there. I've never seen a waitress not care to the point where we sat in booth for over 2-3 hours ...  4. Waiting on a waitress and management to say ""Hey are you ok?"" After asking guy with headset to get a manager. He spoke into his headset. This was pretend because now after waiting 40 mins extra. We had to hunt down a manager whom said ""he doesn't wear a headset."" 5. Male Manager said ""I'll be right with you"" and takes another 30 minutes to even speak to us. A female manager came over and listened to our complaints and concerns (this lady came over because we had to ask Steve a waiter to beg a manager to come speak with us). Then after, the male manager showed up and now we continued to complain to both managers. I was confused because nobody should ever spend 3 hours at TGIF.  6. Our food was cold. So being there for 3 hours we was still starving when we left. So not only did we get the worst service of our lives. We left starving because the food served to us was freezing cold. One order was totally incorrect. Asha was uninterested, she could of checked on us like we were actual customers and realized the food was wrong. She went to get mashed potatoes that we never received and had a big attitude.  7. On a positive note, who ever put in a lot of money to renovate, did a fabulous job! Also, there is a waiter named Steve who was not our waiter. I was dying of thirst. I'm diabetic and I guess having a ambulance pick me off TGIF floor would have been a better solution. Steve, who was not our waiter was gracious enough to stop. He didn't have a attitude or neglect our needs as consumers. He brought over 3 ice waters and cleared our cluttered table. After which he asked if we needed anything. Steve was not our waiter however he treated us like actual paying consumers.  In conclusion this list is going to corporate and if management doesn't clean up the crew, they will go down with the ship. The only person who gets a life preserver is Steve. I will be in contact to find out what happened with Steve because he has been working there for 14 years and he is apparently the only person that try's to improve the service that TGIF has at this location. We usually go to the TGIF on sunrise highway and the staff is friendly, respectful and represent the company with high standards.  This bottom feeding frenzy, where it's seems like management and waiters are good friends so screw over customers is not good. The new renovations are a waste of time if you think ignoring consumers and comping food is going to stop complaints. Your in the wrong business. Customer service, hot food, friendly service and integrity is needed at a corporate chain. I usually tip waiters double the tax or at least 20$.. Couldn't bring myself to leave anything. Especially after sitting at a table for 3 hours being ignored by everyone but Steve..... (We tipped Steve) Wait till I resend this to corporate. Good luck because i will never ever set foot in this TGIF in my life again.  Last but not least, the same two managers had to go to the next table who had the same waitress and listen to more people complain. Sad part is Asha actually look like she was paying attention to their table and those people was still unhappy.  One star is only for Steve who probably saved my life with the glass of ice water.

The patio is open for dining so I look forward to the warmer months sitting outside looking at the boats in the bay. The staff is still inattentive and blah. The bathrooms always look like a hurricane hit. I find myself wondering if the staff was held at gunpoint to apply for work here, that is the only explanation my husband and I could come up with to explain why they all look so miserable.

Both times, they took the dish off my bill without me saying a word about it. That's great customer service.  I give three stars mainly because for one, they advertise on their menu having my favorite beer and they actually don't have it. And two because the bruschetta chicken pasta which used to be so so good made with angel hair pasta and just a hint of sauce is now made with fettuccine pasta and slathered in so much sauce it can't be enjoyed at all because it's all you taste, instead of a nice blend of the chicken, pasta and sauce.

Several other waitresses walked by and didn't even acknowledge our presence. As we were walking out the hostess who sat us 20 min ago made eye contact and walked away. Needless to say we will not be coming back!  Went to Applebee's got seated and had our drink order taken in 5 minutes. Now that's what I call service!

Could she have been helping the others clean tables for the mounting number of guests coming through the door? I guess not..     Finally after a 35 min wait, we were seated. Our waitress was nice and she apologized for our wait. When we asked her what was going on, she said there were only 4 waiters/waitresses and ONE BUSBOY! I was shocked when she said that..

We reluctantly accepted even though the restaurant had plenty of empty tables but there were only about 5 waiters working. 40 minutes later, we ask about being seated and she said her manager told her not to seat anyone due to them being short staffed. 20 minutes later, they're still running around, dropping things, no end in sight.

So any business lucky enough to be in this area will benefit from the large crowds that flock here to enjoy the view. So if I was running a world famous franchise such as ""TGI Friday's"" in this area, it would be the best, well run business in the area, right? Well the only positive I can give them is the view, other then that let me explain why. I came here for the first time with my Girlfriend and her three friends. They like coming here because of that view I mentioned before. Once we walked in we waited to be seated. But the wait was longer then our dining experience there. A hour into our wait we asked the hostess or waiter, whoever it was because he didn't say, what was the hold up. He replied they don't have the staff to accommodate all the guest. I thought this was interesting because it would have made sense and it could be possible if the place was packed. It wasn't. It was empty and there were seats available. You mean to tell me, we couldn't be seated and offered drinks until a waiter could come serve us? The guest behind us told us to pay attention because they were seating people before us that came later. I wanted to say it was because of the size of our party but again they had plenty of available seats. This place wasn't being managed at all. The guest that spoke to us finally decided enough is enough and left. We waited this long we wanted to see this thing to the bitter end. After about a hour and a half we were seated. The waiter took our order and we waited for the food. At this point I was starving, so I knew it wasn't going to be pretty once the food came. I have eaten at ""TGI Friday's"" before, but I must say I was so disappointed. I'm not going to go into a lengthy discussion on the food except to describe want I noticed. I can't really explain the taste of the food, so let me tell you how it looked.  This was the first time my food looked sad. It looked as if it was mistreated before they cooked it and it wasn't proud to be a burger. I couldn't even believe they sent it out like that to me with three strips of tiny bacon and some skimpy french fries. This was not what I expected from ""TGI Friday's"". This part of Brooklyn should be a priority for the company because it's so busy. If this place was run correctly it could be a recommended tourist attraction.

We weren't seated for over an hour in a restaurant that was not that busy and I could see many open tables.  Their reasoning... they didn't have a server for that area. How do you have too few of servers on a Saturday? Isn't that the busiest night for all restaurants in America?  We did notice a lot of groups of 2 and 4 being seated; some that came after us. Their other reason, they only had square tables for 4. Solution: get more round tables that can accommodate odd numbered groups if needed.  I will say our server was pleasant... when we saw her. Since we got squeezed in a random corner we weren't attended to often. It even took 35 minutes to settle the check [1 credit card] I took advantage of their unlimited appetizer special ($10) and topped it off with 2 watered down house Long island iced teas.

107,Taheefa S.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",61,121,171.0,1.0,2017-07-24,"Every visit the customer service and rating continues to decline. I am not sure what's happening with the management and employee service here but it is certainly horrible. I went here on a Friday afternoon in the middle of the day at 2:30pm. There was no rush nor was the restaurant crowded...and were seated around 2:45pm even though the place was empty. The reasoning for this was because a female manager came out and said she has to give her workers and kitchen staff time to catch up so she'll seat us in about 15 mins. I am not sure of her name but her role in this dining experience gets better. While waiting in the entrance to be seated... she's telling the hostess that she doesn't know what's going with the kitchen staff and that another waitress can't even handle the tables she has now, so don't seat anyone. This is unprofessional and ill-mannered. The whole conversation was just uncomfortable to make any customer leave or go home. I didn't leave because my guests and I were hungry and we knew the food here wouldn't disappoint. We were wrong... we eye say shortly after. The same female ""morning manager"" as she called herself told us ""To be honest with you you put in your order now and I don't know when your food is going to come out I have no idea what they're doing back there but I suggest you put something in quick"". Right away my guests and I asked her her role here she said she's a Morning manager and she would go see what's going on in the back (the kitchen). She had no work ethic whatsoever. Our server came about 15 mins after (please remember there is no rush in this place whatsoever) she takes our drinks order and our endless apps order. Fifteen minutes later my order for apps comes out and my guests are still waiting. No drinks came out not even glasses of water were offered. We didn't see our server to complain about waiting so long for our drinks and other apps to come out. She came when we first Ordered our apps and then I asked her for water. She brought out the water about 10 minutes later saying the bar was making our drinks.... whenever we looked over at the bar she was with a couple socializing and tending to Their every need whilst a table Next to mines and ours waited on her. The drinks that ""the bar was making"" came Out about 20 minutes later. We complained about our apps not being refilled or the the first round not coming out. Finally the two missing orders of apps came out we had to call over our server to place our entree orders. She took the order and whisked away again to be at the bar with friends still a table Next to mine was trying to get her attention. Our food came out after 4:00pm and please note the time we came in. I have never had such a horrible dining experience in my life. I didn't like that she kept lying to us about a burger not being cooked yet and the chicken not being ready. Her excuses were just used To excuse her horrible service. The friends she had at the bar, came in after we did and left before we did. I will never come back to this Fridays again. Ever.

If the waitress seats you around the window area, the view of the bay is really cool. And you become convinced of wanting to try some water activities after seeing people canoeing/kayaking. The decor speaks English/Irish pub style with lots of wood (tables and bar), leather (I think it's real) booths and of course, they have a few specialty beers. Not a beer connoisseur so I can't tell you what they had. My date was pregnant; I didn't want my homegirl to feel anyway so I skipped out on ordering alcoholic beverages. We both ordered turkey burgers along with mozzerella sticks for appetizer. For drinks, I ordered a virgin mudslide and she got lemonade. Honestly, the mudslide did not bring a smile on my face. It was missing an ingredient. I shrugged and kept drinking, though. I don't really like to send anything back unless it's horrific. I decided to keep it.  My girlfriend enjoyed her turkey burger but I didn't. It tasted weird to me. I took one bite and I was done. The three mozzerella sticks that I ate was enough to fufill me until I got home so I can eat it again. Service was cool. We had a very nice waitress.  TGIF is right in front of the movie theater so it's very convenient to get a quick bite and have some drinks. Don't expect meals to be five star rating but it serves the purpose.

I had my hyper 3 y/o with me so I did not complain when I was seated in a desolate corner below the main floor. Waitress took order and brought drinks and one appetizer with 30 mins (no plates though). Never saw the waitress again. 1 hour and 20 minutes after being seated our food was served ice cold. Not luke warm but ice cold. The food was sitting in the kitchen so long the melted cheese was already hard and stale. Instead of apologizing or even asking about our food the waitress just sent her manager. Mind you we were very pleasant about the horrible service.  The only good part about the whole meal was the manager Greg.  He apologized profusely, got us new food in 10 mins and comped the whole entire meal after seeing the inedible food. He even comped the ""cup of dirt"" desert we ordered after the fact cause we promised our 3 y/o for behaving so long. All in all we walked out at 4pm. The waitress could care less. Never once checked in on us, never offred a refill and shrugged when the terrible food was served. This place needs more Greg's.

I ordered the grilled salmon with rice and spinach.  The salmon was good and tasty, the spinach had no flavor and the rice was definitely left over from Saturday.  Two people ordered the onion soup and stated that they threw a piece of processed cheese over the top, and called it French onion soup.  After we received our main course, the server brings back the loaded nachos, bacon was cooked, but there still was only about two tablespoons of cheese on it.  We didn't eat it.  They served sweet potato fries cold, so my wife returned it, they came back double fried and over cooked, she returned it again.  I wanted to speak with the manager on duty, but he looked very unprofessional, and un groomed, so I figured discussing all of the food issues would not be addressed accordingly, so we paid the bill and left.  This is not the first time we have had problems here, but everyone has bad days, well TGIF in Brooklyn, you have run out of chances.  We will never eat at this establishment again, nor will our friends, and hopefully their friends as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=20,1.4,1.75,1.744,,1.61

But saw the bar was half empty so I opted for that. Once I sat down I noticed that there were about 6 tables empty but figured it was a staffing issue(strike one).  Only 2 employees behind the bar with about 12 people seated. Found a menu that was laying by and chose a drink, funny enough there were no prices on the menu for cocktails(strike 2, Fridays where the big ballers go who dont need price tags lol). Took a while to get the attention to put order in(about 5 with a few ""be with you in a second""). When the employee came(server: 778 ryan according to receipt) I was told that my choice from the ""Here's To Livin' Light"" menu was only for online/take out orders(It doesnt say that on that menu, will add picture of menu later). Took our drink orders and came back a little on the long side of 5 minutes again(with a few ""be with you in a second"").

I normally dont like to bother people and be ""that guy"" that complains to the waiter but after ANOTHER 15 minutes I decided to stare a hole into the waiter.

She came up to us and said she'll check up on the food(she could probably tell the look on our faces of ""wtf?"") Strike 3.

We got our food and it tasted good but then again after 45 minutes from sitting down and watching other people eat their food and leave I'm guessing anything might taste good.
