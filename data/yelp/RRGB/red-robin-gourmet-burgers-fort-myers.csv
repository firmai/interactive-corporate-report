Rick T.,"Fort Myers, FL",470,27,146,5.0,10/19/2014,Jennifer was our server and did an excellent job! We ordered the towering onion rings appetizer and it was excellent as well. There was football on the TV and the atmosphere was family oriented and lively. The best part however were the burgers. In the 16 years my wife and I have been together we have never been to a restaurant that served her a burger the way she likes it until tonight.  She likes her burgers somewhere between rare and medium rare and most places either can't or won't do it  not so at Red Robin she was thrilled with the way her burger was cooked and I was thrilled to sit and watch her enjoy it! Thank you Jennifer and Red Robin for a wonderful meal!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=20
F K.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,16,2,2.0,6/18/2016,The food was just okay... The bartender kept a messy bar and I had to listen to the servers  complain about their personal affairs and bicker with each other.

Joshua B.,"Bonita Springs, FL",44,1,,2.0,7/13/2016,"Food was ok, all we had was a kids burger and cup of French onion soup. Well, the soup had no onions. Then when time for the check, our server turn a little computer around and said pay here. There was a 1.99$ entertainment charge. We weren't in the restaurant 20 minutes. They said they would take off the bill if i wanted to wait for a manager. I don't want to pay for my meal like I'm at a gas station, i don't want to be charged for entertainment fee, without out being entertained! I don't want to wait for a manager.   I guess the thing that was the worst about it was offering to remove it.

We ordered a few beers, burgers and gotta love them bottomless fries!!!! Heck I won't lie we only came for the fries lol!!!!!! Our meals were great and cooked perfect!  Kim was leaving early to catch a flight to Oklahoma so we settled up with her and gave her a little extra. Everyone wants extra spending money especially on vacation.

Server took our orders we mentioned to the server to split the checks and also I had a birthday burger, remember this as this will come in the story later. waiter took a long time to bring drinks to us, and 20 min ticket time for food, wow the place was empty.  I know why the place was empty as I ordered a pig out burger and it came w no bacon, also burger was not hot at all.  Waited long time to get bill server messed up bill one bill and had charged me for my burger, told him early that I had the coupon.  Manger did not seem to care when we mentioned to him all of these flaws. horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=20

Erin J.,"Tampa, FL",9,177,18,2.0,11/15/2014,You have to wonder if job requirements to be a waitress/waiter at Red Robin requires you to give poor service and not follow directions. I wonder if the kitchen staff are required to also seemingly cook at sloth speed.  This seems to be a chain wide phenomenon and yet apparently people love this place. Why do people I socialize with love this place? Or do they just hate themselves? Or do they like bitching about their dining experiences?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=20

Warning: do not go on family night if you don't like kids or want to wait an hour for a table! Service is always good. Not perfect but good.

Apparently there is segregation at Ref Robin now and people with kids can only sit in a certain section because Red Robin stated to us they don't want kids bothering the other adults! Apparently there is also sections for old people to not have to listen to younger adults. I can only assume they have different sections for different races of people too?? Now that Red Robin has gone ""gourmet burgers"" apparently they have segregated their dining room...

Justin S.,"Fort Myers, FL",3,2,1,2.0,2/16/2014,"My fiancé and I decided to end our shopping excursion with what we thought would be a delightful dining experience...in the end, we left disappointed, here's why: We arrived for a late lunch (330pm) and stood for a moment before being greeted by one of the two hosts that we're chatting amongst themselves with their backs to the doors. No big deal, they were polite! We were informed that there would be a twenty minute wait (I cringed as we planned to see a movie at 505) but was told we could be seated right away anyway.  FYI don't let them seat you at the high tops in the bar. The seats are terribly uncomfortable and will not allow you to relax even the slightest bit--though maybe that's the point! We waited an unacceptable amount of time to get our drink order delivered completely. And when the table to our left, who was seated 15min after, had already gotten drinks AND put in their order....I left my table to go ask that a manager visit us. Two managers ended up assisting us. The GM both took and delivered our order. He tried to please, but overall nobody seemed to have any desire, let alone passion, to create an enjoyable dining experience. Then came the food. Let me just say that had the entire deck not had been stacked against the burger we ordered, it alone would have saved this experience. The royal red robin; it's the burger topped with bacon AND egg. They call it the royal, I'm imagining, because it's the king of burgers! It was cooked to perfection, the tomatoes were crisp and flavorful, and the presentation was awesome. I must say, I was scared that this burger has atop of it an over easy egg. The idea of the yolk bursting and running everywhere (don't like this) really creeped me out. BUT, I shrugged it off and WOW. It was amazing! So, we are hoping that they were just having a bad day. The food alone deserves to be rated higher, but the many service barriers weighed it down. We will give it a shot again soon and hope to feel as royal as our burger tasted!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=20

Donavon K.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,9,3,4.0,11/2/2017,"Onion ring tower is a must order. The camp fire sauce that comes with it is a must. I ordered the Red Robin Burger. It was cook right and came out in A reasonable amount of time. I got the garlic fries, which were amazing. As always the fries are bottomless. It is worth noting you have to pay extra for garlic fries. My meal with the onion ring tower was $25.  I was in a party of 7 and no one had complaints. Average price of the meals where around $12-$15. Mine was more due to the onion rings we all shared.  Our waitress was on the spot with drinks and taking our order. As well as friendly to talk to. I give her 5 stars.  Over all rating for the place is a 4 because I was just not wowed enough to give 5. No real complaints.

Doyle H.,"Fort Myers, FL",35,197,5,3.0,5/9/2017,"Red Robin is a decent chain burger joint.  I've had the fish and chips before - I can't recommend it.  The burgers are good, and there are plenty of options to go with. The fries are unlimited and usually really good. They're the thick, meaty variety too, and to that point, I will say that I've had one of the nastiest fries I've ever put in my mouth from here. It may have been one of the worst things I've ever tasted. I'm not even sure that this was Red Robin's fault, but this thing was foul. The experience has not been repeated, and I have been back several times. On occasion, the service will lag somewhat, but most of the time, it's pretty good. Drinks are kept full, and so are the bottomless fries.  Craving an out-of-the-ordinary burger and some good fries? Stop in to Red Robin. They even have ordinary burgers, but I suggest trying the Royal (with cheese!). It's the one with the fried egg. You may not need to eat again for another few days, but it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
John M.,"Chicago, IL",2,126,16,2.0,10/4/2017,I am going to have to pass on this place. A burger and a drink with tip was over twenty two bucks. Just not worth the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Martin N.,"Fort Myers, FL",205,248,1325,4.0,3/2/2016,"We stop by the Red Robin for a quick meal before an event at the Germaine Arena.  It was early so we were seat immediately and the service was extremely quick! The place was renovated since last June. Décor was clean up a little and now a small Touch Screen computer is available in every table to check the menu, play, and pay your bill! My favorite burger is the Black and Bleu burger. A burger with sautéed Portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, Bleu Cheese sauce and Bleu Cheese on a ciabatta bun with a spread of Dijon Sauce.  Tonight I ordered the Sauteed'shroom Burger instead. Sauteed mushrooms with garlic, on top of melted Swiss cheese and a burger patty. You will not be disappointed with this!  Other party member has the Bleu Ribbon burger. Steak sauce with bleu cheese, on top of onion straws, lettuce and tomatoes on an onion bun! Another member has the Bacon Cheeseburger and a Cheeseburger. Bacon enhanced the flavor of cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes and American Cheese. Unfortunately, we did not have the Mud Pie for dessert! Waitress are friendly and attentive. If you are in the Gulf Coast Center and want a quick burger, Red Robin is a good choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Carol E.,"Naples, FL",93,61,33,2.0,4/3/2017,"Stopped at the Gulf Center Drive location on Sunday, April 2nd around 1:30 pm. This was my first and last time at Red Robin. In the world of great burgers, there is a lot of competition out there and Red Robin fell very short of my moderate expectations. First of all, the buns were very dry. Any burger connoisseur will tell you a really good bun is a very critical element to a great burger. The ideal soft burger bun should be pillowy and tender, with a tight but soft crumb. It should hold up nicely to the burger's juices, but should never be tough or cottony. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you don't want a burger that disintegrates after the first bite. The Red Robin burgers we ordered were dry and very crumbly. I'm not sure if they were stale or simply of poor quality. Next: the overall cleanliness. My booth had crumbs I had to wipe off and the table, having just been wiped down, was still covered in a very thin layer of cleaning solution. The hostess warned us not to set anything on the table and apologized for it still being so wet. I guess no one could be bothered to actually clean AND properly wipe dry the table before allowing guests to be seated. In fact, when our food arrived about 15 minutes later, the table was still wet. A couple french fries toppled on to the table and into the remaining drops of cleaning solution (or water...whatever that was). When the time came to pay the check, the pay-at-the-table pad was so grimy and greasy I honestly didn't want to touch it. This should be wiped down after each turnover! As for the bathrooms: yuck. I try to avoid public restrooms whenever possible but since we were planning on doing more shopping after our lunch I decided to brave it. Dirty stalls, dirty sink, trash overflowing with used paper towels falling from the opening. Completely unacceptable.  The one positive: we had a great waiter. He was efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely worth a gracious tip. Overall, in an area saturated with some really great burger places, next time I'll be bypassing Red Robin and dining elsewhere. Better yet, I'll grill my own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Alex P.,"Atlanta, GA",64,18,5,4.0,10/31/2016,"If you like garlic, you must try the garlic fries. I was expecting regular french fries with garlic salt, but I was happily surprised with real, fresh pressed garlic smothering the french fries. It was awesome. The food is great, but more than just the food, even the service is fantastic. My fiancee and I wanted to split a burger, and when they brought it out, they actually cut the burger in half, set two individual plates with each their own portion of fries. That is the kind of above and beyond service that leaves a positive impact.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
G A.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",93,5,1,1.0,10/17/2017,"Horrible service, no one was at the front hostess station when we walked in, waited 5 min before someone showed up, then it took the waitress more than 5 min to come to our table after we were seated and when she did she had resting Bit** face and attitude the whole time. What is wrong with these people? Food was horrible, my bun was cold and I didn't get my sweet potato fries until 15 min later after I asked for them again and my husbands fries were cold when he got his meal. Total disappointment. Won't go back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Amy E.,"Fort Myers, FL",18,379,282,3.0,11/22/2016,"First time ever in a Red Robin, and I chose the Gulf Coast Town Center location. I can't down rate this place on the first try, but I also can't give it the ""I'm a fan!!"" star treatment either. As a whole, I found everything to be just right; ""A-Ok"".  That being said, I know a lot of people rave about Red Robin, and I honestly have trouble understanding why.  Sure, there's the ""bottomless fries"" offer, but they're steak fries you can buy at the supermarket (or make your own). Yes, the burger I had (Smoky Jack Tavern Double) was good. No complaints about how it was cooked (medium and still dripping from the grille). Although, it was a little messy in the beginning due to the barbecue sauce. As a whole, I found it lacked a ""smoky"" flavor (why are they calling it ""Smoky Jack"" - is it the ""Smoky Campfire Sauce"", the ""bourbon-infused Whiskey River BBQ sauce"" or ""melted Pepper-Jack cheese"" that gives it the flavor? I couldn't tell. However, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet - that was nice kick). For $6.99, I guess I got what I paid for - two small patties on a sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion with Jack cheese and BBQ sauce. Plus hot / fresh steak fries. The burger was quite interesting, given the circumstance. Restaurant as a whole: I feel like the place can't decide if it wants to be fast food on a ""trying to be modernistic and fun restaurant"" budget, or on the next level up restaurant that wants to pretend it sells $10 burgers for the hipster sports crowd. Either way, once I got to look around, I know I've seen the kitschy wall art before... same kind of ""off the wall"" / random decor that most sports bars / funky one-off chain restaurants try to emulate. They want you to have fun eye candy while you wait for your meals.  With the added 12"" iPad (?) standing on each table, Red Robin has become one of the places to bounce its' clients into the 21st century by actually paying on the tablet. There was an Apple Pay type of Square attached to the machine, so you could swipe via gift card, credit card, phone (I think I saw) or have a ""buzz for server"" option to come collect your monies. The downside to this touch screen / pay it yourself program is the fact you do have to wait for a server to collect cash from you. If you don't want to pay by plastic (they assume you will... even our server said ""pay when you're ready on the machine""), it's hard to look at an actual paper receipt and want to put down paper money. You do get a small receipt that's spit out on the bottom of the tablet, so you have proof you paid and what your rewards points are up to. The whole deal comes down to being tabulated on the front end Point Of Sale system and streams magically to your table to this individual POS table top computer. One down side to this, is no free wifi. If you have these tabletop POS computers, offer clients wifi because when you add the Red Robin Rewards system to the checkout, you're expected to do things on your smartphone (like sign up for the rewards on the tablet and then activate everything on your phone, as the rewards number you get isn't yours until you create an account). The plus side to this, is the waitress said if we got on our smartphone right then and there, activated the rewards card, we got a free piece of cake.  All in all, our waitress was nice, and she checked on us when she could. However, she had a lot of tables to wait on in the process of attempting to expedite orders. For two people ordering the $6.99 Tavern burger deal, we walked out almost two hours later, having had an additional order of fries (you honestly only get a solid handful with the burger) and the free cake for signing up.  Will I go back? I don't know. Maybe I'll try another Red Robin somewhere else to compare today's lunch to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,4.0,11/2/2016,"Delicious burgers, so many awesome choices, but I seem to always go with the sautéed shroom burger with a veggie burger. Loads of fresh mushrooms, swiss cheese and a garlic sauce make this burger delicious. The buns are always so fresh and soft too. The veggie burger is a frozen garden burger variety, but the toppings do it for me. The unlimited steak fries are a huge plus too, we order them as soon as we sit down. The food took a while, so we had a few baskets before our food came. The place was nearly empty and the food took a good while to come out, but we had fries.

Every time I ordered bottomless fries the waitress conveniently stays away from the table.  They come to the table twice every time- once for the order and the second time to drop off food- this is also when they tell you how to checkout on table/computer. If they upsell a product that is supposedly unlimited refills why should the customer have to bend over backwards to get them. Just knowing they ordered bottomless they should automatically make an effort to visit the table. Now just the other day was my first time getting the prime rib sandwich- the waitress explained it was a hot sandwich- the place was empty and our order took about 20 mins to come out.. When it did my meat was cold to the touch. I was so hungry I just ate as much as I could bear and survived off my fries. The au ju that it came with was even cold- but surprisingly the sandwich was colder. It looks cooked on the plate but touching and eating it, its was cold. Complete disappointment. Another issue I have with the location is the rewards program on the touchscreen device- it is hit or miss each time. Sometimes it recognizes my phone number and then other days it doesn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers
Chantal M.,"Cape Coral, FL",23,6,3,1.0,7/6/2016,"Flies, bad service, bad food.  The hostess...she took 5 minutes to get to hostess stand when we came in, she seemed drunk or very high & slow, she made a smart ass remark but then laughed at herself, and mumbled.  Waitress...she seemed very new and did not know happy hour menu, she did not come by to check on us after food arrived, and kept calling us sweetheart, babe, or baby.  Food...horrible!  A bit warmer than room temperature chicken for the grilled chicken on a stick. ""Fruit salad"" was red pineapples (ew) and apple bits. Bbq chicken salad was nothing like menu stated...except that it had chicken and lettuce, but it had items missing and items added. It was not worth almost $11. It was missing the dressing stated on menu and after I saw waitress pass several times looking away from our table, my mom finally got her attention for dressing. She asked what kind I wanted and I told her that I wanted what the menu stated and she came back with ranch. At the bottom of the small $11 serving, I saw a bunch of shredded carrots which I avoid and weren't supposed to be in the salad. I had given my son one piece of chicken, cut up, for him to eat. The rest I left next to me and when I went for another piece for him, I noticed about 3 flies on the food. These same flies kept going after everyone's food and we kept swatting them away.  My mom and daughter both enjoyed their food and everything came out for them how they wanted.  The waitress finally checked on us when we were ready to pay and leave. When asked if we needed a box, I was able to tell the waitress that my son's food had flies on it, so we didn't want the baby eating it. She apologized and offered a replacement meal.  Someone (the manager??) came over and knelt down next to me to ask me, ""What happened? Why does he need a replacement meal?""...me, ""Um, there were flies on my son's food."" Him, ""Yeah, we can't keep them out of the place. They're making another meal for him right now."" Then he go up and walked away. I'm guessing that was the manager who did not want us to know his name because he came back while I went to the bathroom (that's a whole other bad review right there) and gave my mom a $10 gift card.  All in all, I never go here, we decided to try something new, and we won't go back.

The worse service I have ever had. Food took 45 mins and he never even came by to apologize for the wait. He only had 6 tables and no bar guests. He was not busy. As a bartender myself I know what it is like and I could not believe how bad he was. Didn't smile once and took my husbands soda away when it was half full and never replaced it. I'm giving them 3 stars only because we had to take our cold food home and when I ate my burger it was amazing. Best burger hands down. I will never sit in the bar area again though.

Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1406,703,282,3.0,9/1/2013,"The reviews on yelp of virtually every restaurant at Gulf Coast Town Center include scathing commentary about service. However, we had absolutely no complaints about our service at Red Robin. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and a man named Antimo treated us like valued customers and really showed us some hustle and fun. Even though we were there at a time where there were no Happy Hour drink specials, the value and taste of our experience was very good and we also appreciated how Red Robin does NOT allow any children in the bar area based on posted signage. More restaurants with designated bar areas should also adopt this rule and give adults a place to quietly enjoy a drink and meal without being exposed to loud and undisciplined kids. This is a bar...not a Wal-Mart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=40

I was hesitant to have the gluten free bread because most of the time it's not very good. Well, he did say if I did not like it he would bring me just the patties with all the trimmings and there would be no charge to fix the burger the way I wanted it.

Welter A.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",4,25,9,2.0,12/19/2014,"Sorry to say that the only Red Robin within 2 hours of me is less than mediocre. Every RR I've been to has been decent or good, this one has been a nightmare twice (0 for 2 here). Went here for my birthday burger (sign up for their rewards, their program is good, but apparently need to go to another store for decent food, read on).  This last time was so dreadful. Service and kitchen were REALLY SLOW (took 20 minutes for apps to come out, half hour for meal AFTER we finished the app), but diner was about at medium capacity. My wife was sitting without any sweetener for her tea for about 20 minutes until the forgetful but nice waitress finally got them (sweeteners were requested from near the beginning). The Jalapeño coins used to be the best anywhere and sometimes I would tell my wife she was on her own because I would get a double order just for myself. I normally never do that anywhere. Now, I think they changed manufacturer and the jalapeños taste pickled, which make them taste super salty. The manager tried to tell me it's because they prepared it with the fries so maybe some salt stuck to it. I call BS because that is how all the other places' coins taste like - they probably caved and are now receiving their shipment from the lowest bidder like everyone else (try Square 1 burgers' jalapeños and tell me they aren't the same?). The portions for the coins were utterly disappointing, but I'm glad it wasn't more, because they sucked - I didn't even finish the tiny bit that I had. This used to be one of my favorite appetizers in any restaurant ever and now... Sigh. My wife's wrap felt like hard duct tape. If the zombie apocalypse ever happened, just wrap yourself with this Red Robin's wrap and you'll be bite proof - no way they can chew through that.  Some of my fries were undercooked and I felt like I had to go through a minefield with trying to find out which one was cooked and which one wasn't. It was gross and I should have stopped, but I'm fat. Since I was still hungry and disappointed, I ordered more fries and asked the waitress to make sure they were cooked well. The burger was ok, it was the only redeeming quality even if the bun was super soggy. The diet soda tasted terrible so I exchanged it for the only other good thing which was the tea (if you manage to get sweeteners with it). With all that mediocrity going around, at least the manager came around and talked to us and gave us a 50% discount which was really nice of him. We used the 50% discount and my birthday burger so it came out pretty cheap. But too expensive for the horrible experience we had. We really hate to ask to be comped, so we left it as is, we think it was a lot more than other managers do. To be honest, I had to hold back from giving it 1 stars because I know that I am extra disappointed that the only RR near me is this bad when I used to live 20 minutes from one that was a PLEASURE to go to. The manager said he was going to check on our fries and walked away. Waitress brought us the check, and told us she was going to check on our fries that we asked for 20 minutes ago. We waited patiently for another 10 minutes sitting at the table with our dipping sauces at the ready and the check paid for. But we just decided to leave. Since we originally ordered the fries it was a whole half hour. Half hour for a refill! We just left without receiving our 1st refill of ""bottomless fries"". This Red Robin has been such a disappointment that I wish it were called something else so as not to tarnish the name of such a great franchise. I really hope for new management soon and I hope corporate steps in to train them, because this place really needs the immediate help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=40

But whatever, it was still amazing and free refills. I unrolled my silverware and to my shock, saw a piece of lettuce still on my knife. Looked caked on. So probably ""washed"" and left on. Gross. Thankfully, I didn't need my knife. Still really gross. The meal was great. Food was really good and everything was tasty. During it, my girl needed a refill.
