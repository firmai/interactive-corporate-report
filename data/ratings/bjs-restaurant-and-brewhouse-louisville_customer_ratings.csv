121,Brittany V.,"Calabasas, CA",2,13,2.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"I've had good experiences and bad. on the good side: I always brought out of town guests here. There something for everyone, and the food is dependable and enjoyable. My go to food choice is the Santa Fe salad with salmon. There's one steady server named Priscilla that's an excellent server. She works up by the bar if you can have a preference. on the bad side: the turnover is very high. It seems like there a new, inexperienced person struggling through their first day every time we step in. Carry out can be a blunder. After driving back twice with messed up orders, I had to be ""that guy"" and check the bags of food before payment after that. The micro-brew is well done, but never went there for just a beer. If you're not a Bro-skulling Cardinal or UK aligent, you'll start planning your dinners and drinks away from there when there are hot basketball games going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=120,3.468,3.468,3.468,3.468,3.468

103,Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16.0,4.0,2012-03-06,"My experience here could not have started out worse. *Sitting down at the bar at 12:45pm on a Sunday, bartender approaches* Bartender: ""I'd ask if you're here for the beer, but I can't serve you any until 1pm."" Me: ""Seriously?!? Is that a state law or something?!?"" *cries* Bartender: ""Yep, sorry. Can I get you a water or something?"" 15 of the longest minutes in the world later, I got my beer. The Tatonka Stout. Holy crap, that was a good beer. Worth the wait, much to my chagrin. I would order that beer several times over any day of the week. They have 8 of their own standard beers and a remarkably good good selection of other craft beers. I was VERY pleasantly surprised at their draft beer selection. The menu was awesome as well. I've never been to a BJ's before and was happy at the diversity of the menu. It reminds me quite a bit of the menu you see at the Cheesecake Factory - just that they traded the cheesecake in for beer. Lots of really interesting things you can find there. The one complaint I have is that the service was not good. Perhaps is was the fact that I was there with a couple friends and their two kids, but the waiter largely ignored  us. We kept having to request that our water get filled (which is one of my biggest complaints).  It was a great experience and I'll gladly go back. I'll just hope I don't have the same waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.6000000000000005

What else can I say?  The marketing geniuses of this place summed it up in those two letters.  They accomplished the best a chain can:  cavernous, comfortale space; convenient location; big TVs; great drinks; giant menu offering quality and quantity of food...plus great service! I found the best turkey burger here!  It contains all of the stuff I love on a burger, none of the crap I usually have to pull out of other burgers.  Large, juicy turkey patty topped with melted Swiss, sautéed mushrooms, fresh(not previously frozen!) avocado slices...all of that on a soft multi-grain bun.  Mmmmmmm....turkey burger!  I did not even miss the beef when I eat this.  The patty is more wide than thick, has a sizable circumference to make my favorite part of a burger:  the patty over bun overhang!  My meal was not for the calorie counting crowd.  It came with crispy thin fries and I dipped them in a side of mayo...yum!  I had to try their wings, too.  Meh...I've had better.  In fact, the only thing memorable about those wings is their tiny size.  I remember thinking it was not worth the long plate they were presented on and the price tag. And if you don't like beer like me, try the Wyder's Pear Cider!  So good and so not like a beer!   BJ's has longer hours than your usual suburban place.  We finally found a place to go past 9PM here in the suburbs!

The guy who seated us apologized for it, but he didn't bother to clean it up! After scooting over it, I ended up sitting on a bunch of crumbs...I was wearing shorts, major bummer.   Then, we went on to order our food: avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini-bruschetta and fish tacos. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things or maybe it was an off night. The avocado egg rolls weren't bad, but part of the wrap was chewy, not exactly the best texture to go with avocado! The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach artichoke dip, breadcrumbs and cheese; they were okay, but they were served warm, not hot. The fish tacos were just alright. The mini bruschetta was the biggest disappointment of the night; the bread was hard, I couldn't even get through one piece.

I am a big fan of their blue cheese burger with garlic aioli(be sure to ask for some of their BBQ sauce on the side, delicious).  My wife had their boneless buffalo wings(breast cut into cubes) which was pretty good, but a bit too hot for me.  We started with their calamari(rings & babies) which was very tender if slightly bland.  It might help if they cut their rings a bit thicker.I had their strawberry lemonade which was pretty good, if a bit too sweet.  Very true strawberry flavour though.   James the bartender was our waiter because we arrived early for lunch.  A very nice young man who did not rush us through our lunch & was happy to converse with us on a variety of subjects, while diligently going about his work.  The olympics had just started so it was nice to see the action on the big screen over the bar.   Overall, it is a very nicely appointed restaurant/bar with great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472
118,Shal V.,"Louisville, KY",32,192,47.0,5.0,2012-08-19,"Went to this unfortunately-named restaurant around 9pm last night for an impromptu date night after an evening of shopping at Oxmoor Mall. As soon as we walked in, I was struck by the ambience that melds a stylish design with a sports bar feel while not being kitschy in any way. They have a deceptively large seating area but tables are adequately spaced apart so you don't have to worry about inadvertently jabbing the person in the adjacent table in the eye with a fork or listen to some garrulous old crank bloviating about something (although in this case, you may feel the urge to wield your silverware as a weapon).  We started with the Chicken Wonton appetizer (Filled with marinated chicken and cream cheese, lightly battered and fried) - you can get them Buffalo or Thai style. We got the Buffalo-style, which means they serve it with Buffalo sauce and Ranch dressing. Muy delicioso!! My wife ordered the Grilled Burger Melt (a half-pound Angus burger, grilled to order, topped with cheddar & Swiss cheeses, caramelized onions and BJ's special burger sauce on grilled sourdough bread) - she loved it. I had the utterly scrumptious Black and Blue Burger (1/2 pound blackened Angus patty with a melted creamy bleu cheese topping, crispy Applewood smoked bacon, roasted garlic aioli and tomatoes), which was easily one of the best burgers I've eaten in eons!! I can't stop raving about it - cooked and seasoned to perfection, with the delightfully succulent combination of blue cheese and garlic aioli perfectly complementing the flavor.  Samantha's service was exceptional too! She was prompt, friendly, had an exuberance that was charmingly infectious, and she was candid when giving us her recommendations. As I've stated in previous reviews, I try to avoid chain restaurants as much as I can but our dining experience at BJ's on Saturday night was stellar!! Every time I'm at Oxmoor Mall, it will be hard to resist the enticing siren call of BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572

I decided to indulge in one of my guilty pleasures...cream soda! Also fantastic and well worth the extra calories! For my main meal, I got the shrimp tacos. I have had them here before and I love love LOVE them. I don't know what it is, but they are super.

56,Kellyo O.,"Prospect, KY",201,512,1136.0,4.0,2013-04-30,"First off: the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Fun place and good food. Went with my family and the first thing I noticed was that BJ's was right next to Dick's. Seriously? What genious planned that layout? Since I am really a 13 yr old boy underneath, I was chuckling pretty hard and trying not to let it show so I didn't get 80 questions from the kids. The only two bad points that I am going to point out to get out of the way is that my dad, who walks with a cane, thought the floor was wet and about had a panic attack walking out of the revolving door. (PS - DO NOT let your kids follow your father through the revolving door. While he is holding the door for stability as he is testing the floor with his cane to see if it is drenched with water the youngin's will PUSH with all their might to make that door keep revolving. Bad things can happen and as funny as it looks from the outside - sorta like a Three Stooges comedy routine - it is not funny when you find out the back story.) Anyway, after making it past the incredibly WET LOOKING floor that is really just 100 gallons of shellac, you get to be seated in a gigantic room. Which brings up my second issue - try not to be seated under the big air blowers, they get kind of cold. On to the good stuff! Mom and I had the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Hubby had the avacado egg rolls & he thought they were good and daughter had the calamari which she deemed ""pretty good"". She just eats calamari when we go out so she's had lots! My dad had the pot roast and potatoes which I am guessing were fantastic since they lasted about 5 seconds on his plate. I also ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen which I thought was tasty. I will be back to try some of their other brews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.472,3.76

Once I had the best cobb salad I have ever had, next time it was completely different and not worth eating. Burgers were overly greasy. Yes I agree a greasy burger can be amazing, but there is a limit to greasy. When you realize it is greasy and hear yourself getting fatter, that's too greasy. I actually didn't finish my burger because I knew it must be horribly bad for me and it wasn't amazing enough as far as flavor to be worth it. Great place for larger parties. Hand crafted beers that can get a little expensive since they are just ok. They do have some lighter options on the menu, so you can eat relatively healthy here if you want. The lighter options are pretty good too, so don't over look them . Menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory in that it is very extensive and actually has the same feel. Apparently some of upper management from Cheesecake Factory now work at BJ's, so this explains the same feel from both places.

127,Sarah H.,"Louisville, KY",127,224,102.0,3.0,2013-08-03,I have been to Bj's twice now. My biggest complaint is the size of their menu. Restaurants that seem to do everything rarely do anything well. I think their pizzas are what they really specialize in and having tried both the deep dish and thin crust I will say that they are pretty good. The other food however while not bad is nothing outstanding. It's about what you might expect from any chain restaurant. As far as the pizza goes I recommend the deep dish. It's bready and cheesy and delicious. The thin crust was good as well ( I had the buffalo chicken pizza) but part of my crust had gotten pretty soggy by the time I tried to eat it. In fact two slices fell right apart when I picked them up. The buffalo chicken topping was good and pretty spicy. I think it would be better with either crumbled blue cheese or blue cheese dressing drizzled over the top instead of ranch. I think if they scaled down the size of their menu and focused mainly on their pizzas and a few other options this could definitely be a more frequent dinner spot for me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=120,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.404,3.92

You could sum up everything with 'pretty good'. There's nothing particularly awesome here but everything is pretty good. The highlight is the broad spectrum of selection from menu and everything is solid, not spectacular. The only real issue I had here...the service. Now, I'm rarely one to use service against a place. Having been a server for a long time, I know there are a lot of reasons a server can be busy and appear un-attentive. I am more forgiving of this than most. But on the most recent visit, the service was just plain bad. The restaurant was pretty busy, not packed, but busy. It took about 15 minutes to be greeted once we were at our table and then another 15 minutes to get our water...I don't remember how long it took to get the beer but I think we had to set up a tent for the night and get it in the morning. The food, that didn't come for 3-5 days later I don't think.  I only knock this down to a 3 star, but for some people the service would have been a dealbreaker. So use this as a word of caution, if you are in a hurry on a Friday or Saturday night or you are just one of those people that is really particular about this sort of thing you might want to avoid BJ's Brewhouse except at some off-hour on a weekday. Because I sense that when they get even a little busy this place grinds to a halt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.2760000000000007,3.92

We decided on BJ's restaurant, which was about 10 minutes from our hotel. My husband called and ordered the Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which we split so we could both have a little bit of each. We also ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Santa Fe Spring Rolls for appetizers. Both our kids had the Macaroni and Cheese Kid's Meals. My husband said when he went to pick the food up, everyone there was very helpful and even offered to get him extra utensils and napkins since we were staying at a hotel. When he got back with the food, I couldn't believe the portions; they were huge! The Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken were both excellent, as well as the White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes that came as a side with the chicken. The appetizers were delicious as well. I particularly liked the spring rolls with the avocado cream sauce. In all, it was a delicious and filling meal, and it was reasonably priced for a family of four and as much food as we received.

So what I like about their menu is that they have an extensive drink menu. Especially beer. I'm not a huge beer fan, but I love their beer. They have seasonal beer that they brew on their own, and it's delicious. I remember going to BJs during Halloween season and having a pumpkin flavored beer. It was yummy. Last time I was here, I got their berry cider. SOOO PRETTY and SOOO YUMMY!!!! Come here during lunch time. The pint of berry cider was only $3.50. I wanna go back to have some beer on my own right now just thinking about it. The staff at this particular BJ are all very nice and attentive. I've never encountered anyone rude. So on to their food. I don't get anything but their deep dish pizza. So yum. Their crust is so nice, fluffy, and chewy. Kinda reminds me of how Pizza Hut used to taste like 20 years ago... when they used to be good. hahaha. My only complaint is price. You can get pizza these days at one of the typical pizza joints like papa johns and dominos for less than $10. I got a medium sized 11"" pizza for around $20. It's a little pricey. I would def come back here for their drinks and food, but not as often as I would like because of their price. But you get what you pay for. Their pizza is delicious. So if you like chicago style deep dish pizza, come and try their pizza! Oh so they extended their menu and they now have the regular hand tossed pizza as well. So for those of you who don't like deep dish, you can now get the hand tossed here. Fabulous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.408,3.88

My fiancé ordered the pasta lunch special with soup.  Spaghetti with clam chowder.   The Frito Nachos app was tasty but something we could easily make at home. The clam chowder was surprisingly good for a non seafood style restaurant.  Our waiter gained some points back from the beer confusion by bringing a box (as it was too much food for us)  and the check without asking.  Overall the food was good, service was polite and friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant.  If I was in the mall and in the mood for a beer I would stop in again.  FYI - They have a military discount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.308,3.8

Thirty minutes before arrival I called and was told I needed to make a reservation. I was insistent that I was told differently and after a minute or so she begrudgingly put my name on the list. When we arrived we waited for over thirty minutes (why did I call ahead?). A couple of people in our party didn't show so we were seated after the adjustment was made but it all seemed like such a chore.  The food was ok. The Tomato and Mozzarella Salad was very good. I got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and there was a lot of good flavor but the shrimp was cold. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be or not. But I wish it had been hot or at least warm.

I hate to write negative reviews, however it's sometimes unavoidable. I have been to BJ's a number of times with varying table sizes and at different occupancies. This week two other Yelp Elites and I went to BJ's for half price wine night after a workout class. It was very crowded. Our server came and asked if we knew what we wanted. At the time we just asked for waters. When she came back (after about 7 minutes) she brought waters and took our wine orders. It took forever for the wine to arrive and my water sat empty the whole time. Once we got the waters, we ordered our dinner. I asked if I could get one of the quinoa bowls listed on the menu without meat, since I am a vegetarian. She said I could, but they would charge me for the meat. I told her I did not want to pay for salmon or chicken if I wasn't eating it and she said she'd ask the kitchen and come back with an answer. It took about 10 minutes for her to come and tell me they would adjust the price of the quinoa bowl and serve it without meat. During that time she went to several other tables and checked on them, while I still had no water. The quinoa bowl was good and the wine was a great deal, but I will avoid going back to BJ's for a while because the service was so bad.

When we walked in, the hostess asked us how many, and we told her two. She then directed us to stand by a sign about five feet away while she collected the menus. I thought that was odd and felt more like a child lining up for recess instead of waiting for someone to take me to my table. The server got our drink order pretty quickly but then took awhile to come back to the table to take our order. When she finally did, she promptly put it in the computer. Our food came out quickly and everything was right. The only problem was the our server didn't check on us until we were almost done. We needed some napkins and water and it would have been nice if she was more attentive. The food was excellent. My wife got the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and I got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich. We will go back because the food was good, but the service was not something to brag about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.472,3.76

11,Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",387,338,279.0,4.0,2015-12-27,"Fresh and delicious entree salads, California flatbread, and pizookies are just three little reasons BJs is on my ""go to"" list!   Despite being a chain restaurant, BJ's offers inspired and healthy creations made from quality fresh ingredients that keep bringing me back. I wouldn't be reaching so far if I suggested there is almost a mom and pop feel to many of their dishes!! Far more than a Friday's or Applebee's, this place offers consistent quality to their salads.  The roasted kale and brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite item on the menu, featuring lovely bits of tender chicken, crisp, piquant onion, salty pepita seeds, acidic and creamy goat cheese, sweet dried cranberries, and juicy purple grapes---all perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangy dressing.  Then there's the twisted Blt with Bleu cheese, spinach, copious amounts of bacon and a tangy honey-Sriracha dressing. I get two and make it my entree (it's a side salad but you can make it a ""double"" upon request) It's truly a party in your mouth!  Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.3440000000000003,3.8

60,Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",165,290,384.0,3.0,2016-03-30,"I rate the food at BJ's 4 stars, but the service here is so awful that it brings my rating down to 3 stars. I generally base my reviews almost entirely on the food and value, so the service has to be pretty bad for it to affect my rating. I've dined at BJ's many times, and the service has never been great, but last night it was horrendous. I arrived at 5:40 on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a respectable amount of other guests, but the place was not crowded by any means. After being seated, it took 15 minutes to be greeted. Unacceptable. I was with my BFF who had her newborn, so going elsewhere was not an option. We ordered and received our meals in a comparatively timely fashion. Our food and conversation kept us occupied so we didn't notice our missing waitress as much until it was time to pay. After requesting our checks, we waited 20 minutes to receive them. After placing our credit cards in the booklet (and leaving it open so she could see they were ready to be taken), we waited 20 minutes for them to be picked up. Ridiculous. There should be a 20-minute rule similar to when your college professor is late/no-show for class. If your server doesn't take your payment in 20 minutes, you're allowed to leave. I mean, come on, we're trying to give you our money here. After everything was said and done, we pulled out of the restaurant at 7:30. Almost two hours for dinner on a Tuesday afternoon. It took so long that instead of shopping afterwards like we had planned to do, we had to part ways so my friend could get home for her baby's bath time. From what I could tell, the problem is that they are understaffed/servers have too many tables.  One last complaint before I think positive thoughts... It really annoys me when restaurants feature happy hour prices that are available in the bar area only. Why should I have to pay full price when someone sitting 10 feet from me receives a discounted price? As a customer, it feels unfair. It discourages me from buying drinks more so than if there were no happy hour at all. I don't get a drink solely on principal. Either that, or I'll walk myself to the bar and order a drink. It's a pretty stupid policy that really grinds my gears. #rantover Now onto the positive. The food is actually really good, especially for a mall chain. As mentioned previously, I'd give the food 4 stars. The menu is large, and everything on it looks delicious. Everything I've tried has been above average. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. BJ's also features an ""enlightened"" portion on their menu, with plenty of options under 675 calories. It's nice to have more than one or two options if you want to go the low-calorie route. I typically go with a large entrée salad for dinner, or a sandwich combo for lunch. Those are my go-to's, though I've tried plenty of other dishes and have been pleased with them all. Overall, BJ's is a good choice. Perfect for a leisurely day at the mall. If you're in a hurry or have somewhere to be though, be warned that BJ's could slow you down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=40,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.2440000000000007,3.76

I ordered the bacon cheese burger with wedge fries (there are thin or wedge fries) and my daughter got the bacon ranch piadia with wedge fries. The fries were very good. The burger was cooked over a gas flame which was evident by the gas flavor through the whole burger. The fixings in the burger were fresh and generous.  The over all taste was however bland. The burger wanted to be good but it just did not make it.  A bit of seasoning may help. The homemade sodas are to kill for. I tried both the root beer and the cream soda.

After bumping into a friend at Oxmoor Mall, we went to BJ's for dinner. There was a 30 minute wait for a table, and it was really cold outside/by the door. We asked about sitting at the bar. They told us it wasn't reserved, so if we could find a seat we could take it. Luckily, as we approached two people were leaving. We swooped in and sat down. We were quickly greeted by a supercalifragilisticexpiali-friendly bartender. His name was Matthew. And he truly made our night incredible. He let us try samples of their beer. I knew that BJ's was a brewhouse, but I did not realize that they brew their own beers. In hindsight this does make sense. I had the Harvest Hefeweizen. It was super hella good!  And the fun didn't stop there, Matthew brought over a few samples of your own beer mixes. Some sweet brews mixed with a Porter and things like that -- just to be friendly.  My friend, Meghan ordered the calamari as we sat and sipped our beers.  It was a Friday, but I had Taco Tuesday on the mind. So when I saw that they had shrimp tacos on the menu it wasn't a hard decision.  I appreciated the menu had lots of pictures of the food. The menu itself is a tad overwhelming, it's a large book of options much like the book/menu at Cheesecake Factory.  Everything sounded delicious: pasta, flatbread, pizzas, burgers... But I wanted the tacos. So tacos I got.  The tacos came with a side of chips and avocado cream dip -- it was really good.   Meghan ordered the pasta, I didn't try any but her plate was totally cleared by the end of our evening so I'm going to assume she liked it.   Meghan's birthday just so happened to be the same week, so our random chance meeting at the mall turned into a ""hey, let's go celebrate your birthday dinner"".  We asked Matthew if they gave any sort of dessert for the birthdays. I'm pretty sure his answer was ""hell yeah!""  A couple minutes later a small cast iron serving dish with a fresh, chunky chip chocolate cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a lit candle arrived.  She loved it!  The desert and the extra touch of the candle really made her feel special. And she was kind enough to share with me, making me feel special too.  With it being her birthday and all, I wanted to treat her to dinner. She didn't know that I was planning to do this and was surprised when I said one check.  With the three beers, an appetizer, the shrimp tacos and the pasta fettuccine, the bill was just over $50.  When I checked-in on Yelp, I saw that there was a banner advertising buy $50 get $60. I decided to do this.  The banner on Yelp took me to BJ's website. When I added a $50 e-card to my cart and attempted to check it out, I noticed that it totaled $50, not $60. I was hesitant to buy through the website and not be able to use it so, I asked Matthew about it. He wasn't sure but he suggested that his manager was a pretty cool dude and I could talk with him.  The manager (I wish I could remember his name), was really nice. He said he thought that it would send me a separate $10 e-certificate, but he wasn't sure.  He also thought that maybe it was an old advertisement, like a Christmas special.  I told him that it was my understanding that a check-in offer or Yelp deal like this would be set up by that restaurant, not just something Yelp put out there without asking. I asked him if he would just take $10 off my check to make it easier on both of us. He agreed without hesitation and went over to the computer to input the change immediately.  I was really impressed by this customer service. He could have easily told me there was nothing he could do about it, but he didn't; and now I'm more likely to return to BJ's. I respect a business that follows through with what they promised. When I return I will want to sit at the bar to high-five my new friend Matthew and I'll try to time it during a happy hour so my bill is a little smaller. But, for an impromptu birthday celebration with one of my besties from High School, it could have been more awesome!  I honestly think Matthew was the difference maker for our visit. We came in having long, rough weeks and left 3 hours later with big smiles and a new friend.  Why the 4-stars versus 5: - the breading on the calamari was a little thin and soggy in a few spots. The red cocktail sauce was delicious, but there wasn't enough. (I feel confident that if we'd not been so busy catching up and asked for more sauce -- they would have brought more) - the Yelp Deal not working correctly through the app. Parent company - if you're going to advertise and have the offer on your website instead of through Yelp directly .. make sure the link works.  (And send your manager a thank you for being such a great guy and following through on that promise) :)  -- his reaction could have been a dealbreaker. Integrity is really import to me; and your store manager has it!  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville,3.64,3.79,3.79,3.632,3.7300000000000004

For food I split a Cobb salad with my boyfriend and my friend got a burger. All the food was great! And for dessert we had to get the Pizookie because that is the specialty. I like that they now offer sample sized ones to try different flavors. We tried the smaller size of peanut butter, regular, and cookies and cream. They were all amazing, but the cookies and cream one blew us away. Make sure you try the cookies and cream pizookie!!

This week we chose BJ's for our party of 20. The reservation was made the morning of and we were each kindly greeted upon our arrival. Since the layout of the seating was one long thin table, a request was made to rearrange the tables where we could talk easier among the large group. They quickly accommodated that request as well. That was just the beginning of a perfect night. We had two waitresses that took our orders, delivered them promptly and courteously, took our dinner orders which came extremely quickly, all while serving every needy request of our large group. Out of the 20 of us there was not a single complaint about our food, service or the amount of time it took to get our orders. This is our fourth trip to BJ's as a group (I go more regularly) and I can tell you not a single one before was any different than this trip.

92,Michelle W.,"Louisville, KY",31,72,136.0,5.0,2017-09-01,"Restaurants attached to malls are not my favorite. I don't try to hardcore judge them, but it takes away some of the cool factor to have to fight mall traffic to get in or park. For some reason though it doesn't bother me with this place. The ambience is what you'd want from such a place, the entrance into the mall isn't glaringly obvious, and if there's a long wait I can just browse in Sephora!  I used to exclusively get pizza and not even look at the rest of the menu, until a friend introduced me to their parmesan encrusted chicken. My eyes were opened to amazing other options that they serve and I've never had a bad meal yet. The most appealing part however, is the homemade sodas. Homemade rootbeers, and drinks that are made from their homemade rootbeers are my favorite. But the black cherry is also delicious. Actually they all are, I'm not biased.
