I can't believe they charged me a dollar for 4 slices of jalapeño, I paid 2 cents for a Whole one at the market yesterday. Ridiculous. Next time I'll bring my own it will be fresh,not the trash they served me it was mushy. I still can't believe it. If you're going to charge it should at least be fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20
Katherine D.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,9,,5.0,10/14/2017,"My husband and I stopped in Thursday evening , after a movie.  No waiting, we were in a booth with drinks and menus in under 10 minutes.  When a issue arose with my order, it was corrected immediately with no fuss.  After this, we weren't ignored as can happen after a complaint.  In fact, our server Joshua and his trainee, Zoe, were fantastic!  Sometimes mistakes just happen, it is how they are corrected that is remembered.  Great service & a wonderful meal.  Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20

Pamela K.,"Tustin, CA",672,660,395,2.0,8/3/2015,"After some afternoon shooting we decided to get some burgers at Red Robin. This was their famed burger with a runny egg on it. ""Gourmet"". This was hardly gourmet but they had a nice selection of different burgers on it. Even with bacon, this was sadly still very much a backyard burger. I was pretty disappointed since it cost around $10USD. The runny egg seemed like a delicious endeavor at first, but ended up becoming a runny mess, most of which just ended up on my plate. Much to more dismay, my fries was but a small cup. I realized later this was similar to places like Eureka! in Claremont, but at least RR had unlimited fries. Which kept coming in small batches. WHYYYY. I felt like I was eating a watery burger because the lettuce and tomato had absolutely no flavor. This was just an epic fail of food. If you want a real burger, go to Pie Dog in Fullerton, or G Burger in La Habra. If you're feeling adventurous, my number one place is still Golden State off of Fairfax in Los Angeles. Those are real gourmet burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20
Tim F.,"Chino Hills, CA",76,192,262,4.0,8/25/2015,"We lifted our cup of fries and discovered: The cup is bottomless. Oh wait, HAHAHAHAHA. I've only ever been to this Red Robin location. I come here randomly once a year, so I may be biased.  In short, I like this place. It's a pretty chill vibe, they got lots of burgers, and bottomless fries. I've gotten different burgers every visit and I liked 'em all (Wolverine Burger, Monster Burger, Chicken BBQ River ??? Burger to name a few).  The only thing I don't like about this place is this: the cup of fries is small. I need to hail a server every 10 minutes because I just demolish mine instantly. I usually come here with a few friends and eat slowly. If you eat at any kind of respectable pace, you'll be hailing constantly.  Servers are nice about it. More fries? Yeah, of course! After the first time, they give you a plate of fries. And this plate of fries probably fits into your bottomless cup (it's like 1/4 of the plate). So this place is pretty stingy with fries... But a $10 burger is typical at other restaurants (Tahoe Joe's, Mimi's Cafe, Smashburger are all like $7-$10) without bottomless fries. Considering that, it's a pretty good deal. Even if you gotta stack up plates on plates of extra orders of free fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20
Ida C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",760,435,613,3.0,4/19/2016,"Note: The iPads on the table charge money if you want to play games. Seriously, any kid can bypass the ""parental consent"" and just start playing games. Just beware, so you won't be shocked when the bill comes and there is an extra charge.  The burgers here are pretty good and there are a lot of choices to choose from. They are offering ramen burgers now. I think everyone can agree that the unlimited fries are what keeps them coming. The freckled lemonade also comes with free refills. In the end, it's a pretty good deal. They have ""healthier options"" now where you can substitute buns and have your burger wrapped in lettuce (think protein style burger from In-n-Out). I opted for that option to make myself feel better about devouring some fries. You can also order broccoli or beans instead of fries. I also saw some gluten free options too, for those of you who are allergic to gluten.  A lot of families frequently come here and I can see why. The food is plentiful and there are lots of different choices for everybody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20
Ryann N.,"Ontario, CA",2,8,2,1.0,10/30/2017,"If I could give zero stars I would.  We had a party of 4 adults and two kids. The restaurant was empty but we had to wait 15 mins to be seated which was understandable I guess if they wanted to set up an area for us... We finally were seated where we waited another 15 mins with hungry kids and no one even came to take our drink order. We had to leave because we are hungry. My dad tried to talk to a manager just to let them know we were forgot about.. when the ""waitress"" or whoever was ignoring us walked up to tell the manager that that's not how it went down. Which is completely rude. We were only in town to go to the pumpkin patch down the street but I will never recommend this Red Robin to anyone. Thanks chumps.

It was happy hour time and we ordered nachos to start our dinner. When it came out, I took the first bite into the nachos, but my peripheral vision saw something moving next to the chip where I had grabbed my first bite. Low and behold! It's this itsy bitsy spider! OMG! with a web attached to it.  So disgusting!!! I picked it up to make sure I saw what I had thought I saw and yes, it was a spider all right!  Yea, so I lost my appetite on the nachos...

Scott R.,"Irvine, CA",519,157,2690,3.0,12/13/2015,"The evening started off well.  The sever came by shortly after we were seated and started our order.  They were demonstrating a new tabletop device that customers can use to order food directly.  I wanted an appetizer wedge and the server showed me how to order it.  Our server assured me that the salad would on it's way quickly because the order had been transmitted directly to the kitchen.  He then took the rest of our order in the traditional way.  About 20 minutes passed and no salad was delivered our server also never made it back to the table.  The rest of the meal was delivered and the server basic dropped it and dashed.  Another 5 minutes and the salad showed it.  It looked really good but by this point in the meal I no longer wanted it and sent it back.  No one ever checked back with and we had to use the call button to get someone over to for drink refills.  When the time came to pay I had have the manager come over to remove the salad from the bill, which had not been done proactively when I refused it.  The manager apologized for the poor service and gave me a $10 gift card as compensation.  I like the idea of the tableside device to get order and get the attention of server but in this case it served to disconnect us from the servers who relied on it to heavily and did not provide any kind of proactive service. Besides the difficulty with the device and the service the food was good and prepared to our specifications.  They do need to work on their bottomless fries.  All to often they have arrived cold and it's been difficult to get refills.   I've had many good experiences at Red Robin and hope this was one was just a blip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=20

Haven't seen one commercial. Go figure! When we walked in, we were super confused. There is a host podium, but no host. No sign stating seat yourself. So we stood there for a minute, as staff walked by. Decided, welp, let's just sit. Apparently that was the thing to do. Someone came and gave us menus.  It was lunch hour, but not terribly busy. Maybe half full. But it still took 25 minutes for our food to come out. We had to scarf it down, to ge back to work in time. (We did, with 4 minutes to spare! Yesss!) I got the original burger, which I asked for well done. It was still pink in the middle. Grrr! No time to send it back. I delt with it. It was good. But, they aren't the best. Garlic fries don't have very much garlic. But they were good.  My husband got the french dip, I think it was called. That was pretty darn good! I wish I had ordered that. It came with cole slaw, which was also good.  Our server was on top of things. Asked if we wanted refills. Asked how we were a few times.  We will be back. Maybe when we have more time.

Michelle E.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,75,244,5.0,3/9/2017,"Red Robin is, in my opinion, the best place to fulfill your food cravings. The service here is always very friendly, the food is amazing, and the design and decorations are cool and trendy. *Banzai Burger w/ lettuce bun & vegan boca patty (5/5): This burger is amazing! It has 2 grilled pineapple slices, ranch, teriyaki sauce, tomato, and melted cheese on the vegan boca patty all put together between lettuce buns. *Donut Ring Tower (5/5): These donuts are seriously AMAZING. It's really unique because it tastes like a donut but at the same time like a cronut??? The donut is soft and chewy with the outside coated with sugar. It's the perfect sweetness and paired with the chocolate sauce is even better! The donut tower comes with a side of chocolate sauce & strawberry sauce. I like the chocolate sauce the best :) *BBQ Whiskey River Burger (5/5): This is my Red Robin go-to order. It's probably one of the best burgers at red robin. This burger has lettuce, tomatoes, mayonnaise, melted cheddar, bourbon infused Whiskey River BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, and a beef patty all put together between 2 warm buns. I love how the burger's not overkill & greasy like other fast food restaurants. The bbq sauce is the key component in the burger and I love how it tastes and brings the entire burger to life. Amazing. *Onion ring tower (5/5): You can't go wrong with their onion rings. These onion rings are crispy on the outside, but not too greasy and the two sauces that comes with it is delicious too. Dip the onion rings in the sauces and you've got heaven in your mouth. *Root Beer Float (5/5): One of my favorite things here that's a must have for me. I love it even more because it's bottomless, so unlimited root beer float! Their root beer is the best! Every time I want to ensure a great meal experience, I always go to Red Robin.

Carlos O.,"Riverside, CA",0,24,1,1.0,7/8/2017,"I should've known this was gonna be bad when I noticed our waiter had a heart tattoo on his arm dedicated to his mom. That level of douche baggery was only emphasized by the anchor and chain tattoo on the other arm. Someone please call Kat Von D.  I ordered a root beer float for a drink, which I read was bottomless. He shows up with our drinks and hand me a flat half empty glass of root beer with no ice cream, returns with a mug full of runny soft serve. This is not a root beer float. The people at A&W would be wildly offended. I then asked for a traditional float, no side of flat soda and received the most bastardized version of a root beer float this country has ever seen. So I settled and took it, at least he met me half way.  Our appetizer was late, and when our food got here, the fries were cold and the BBQ sauce on my wife's burger looked so dry you'd think it had been sitting there for a week. An do we really have to ask for extra napkins? You seriously expect 1 napkin to hold you over for a BBQ burger, fries and onion rings?? I then mustered the courage to ask for another float (since they're bottomless) and the waiter with the fashionable tattoos told me there were no refills. I said fine, bring me a Coke. He checked the menu and shamefully brought me another float.

Will D.,"Ontario, CA",13,10,1,1.0,7/25/2016,"I've been here once before on the recommendation of a friend, and that first time was a terrible experience: from a waiter who made me feel stupid for not knowing how to prder a double cheeseburger that wasnt the ""kid's one"" as he put it, to fries that were not only not well done as I had ordered, but were undercooked entirely. Today I tried to give them another shot, as my fiancee said that she was hungry and it smelled good.  I figured fine, it's been years, and maybe they're better. In my opinion, nothing has changed.  I thought I ordered what was described on the menu as a double cheeseburger with bigger patties ""The Big Tavern"", but apparently I was wrong, as i only got a single burger, and the waiter didn't show any care for my confusion at all -- very reminiscent of my first time here.  He also forgot my fiancee's ranch and brought her the wrong beer... but maybe it was his first day -- who knows. What bothered me even further is that, as someone who has just started playing Pokemon Go! And was enjoying it, I overheard the two bartender women speaking in a condescending manner about its players ""my son plays it... but of course he's also fifteen"" etc.  As a location that has been marked as a gym, you may want to embrace the free publicity instead of having your staff alienate the demographic.

I ordered the Poppin' Purple Lemonade (Prickly pear lemonade) as I always do, but at this location it was TOO sweet. Its like they put too much sugar syrup and didn't mix it well. I had to add 1/4 of water to it just to dilute the sugar. Food-wise, everything tasted good as it always does. Burgers are huge, steak fries are bottomless. The stack of onion rings were on point. The only complaint I had was that my boyfriend upgraded his steak fries to garlic parmesan (which you now have to pay for) and it was not worth it. They just sprinkled some garlic and a dash of cheese on the same fries. It tasted like the normal fries. If you want some real garlic tasting fries I suggest getting normal steak fries and upgrading the dipping sauce (extra $0.99) to the garlic aioli. Its cheaper and better!  Overall the food is always good. Burgers are delicious and bottomless fries are a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=40
Simon C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",240,66,108,5.0,6/16/2016,"Service was amazing! Fries came out with no hesitation and was fried to perfection.  The wait for the burger was very short.  The waitress was very helpful and eager to help us order and bring the food out.  I especially enjoy that Red Robin is sort of melting the garlic and cheese on the bottomless fries.  As a fries enthusiast, it is very nice to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=40

Going to the bar to pickup a to go order is challenging, especially when the bar is full.  It makes more sense to out the responsibility on the host or hostess who have more free time to assist with to go orders. I recommend red robin uses a setup like Chile's.  Chile's has the to go order and pick up process down pat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=40

Our bartender was friendly and provided relatively sufficient service, though she was clearly distracted and preoccupied chatting it up with an off-duty coworker. Food and drinks were fine, Burgers had the taste of being on the expo line for a few minutes too long (You can clearly see when your cheese was melted 10 minutes ago), but other than that, no complaints. We'll surely return when we're in the area because we are RR fans. The service wasn't BAD, but wasn't great either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=40
Karen F.,"Pomona, CA",49,32,31,4.0,5/26/2015,"Gotta love Red Robin, another stomping ground of mine. I love the atmosphere--the 50s imagery, the movies, music, and artistry. They have changed it a bit, with different style seating. The bar high chairs are a little uncomfortable unfortunately. I also see that some prices have gone up, which I'm not too wild about. The food has always been great. They always cook our burgers to order and it's always very hot and fresh. The best thing about Red Robin, I think, is their burgers. Not only are they creative with styles and flavoring, but those burgers are ORGANIZED. You know what I mean, like the TV commercials that advertise burgers that look so luscious and clean, they could be made of plastic? That's how Red Robin burgers look. You can tell that they really care about their food presentation. It's on point.  My favorites are the Onion Ring Stack, Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger, The Orange Cream Soda, and the Mud Pie--all to die for! They also have really delicious shakes! Their portion sizes are enough to make you wish you'd worn your stretchy pants. Overall, the service is great with very few lags, the atmosphere is fun, the place is always squeaky clean, and the food is scrumptious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=40

She came right back out, so I looked around the corner and our Bartender (Christina) was there, I asked if she could help me with Linda, she said sure!

Francisco R.,"Ontario, CA",35,4,1,2.0,12/3/2016,"My family and I usually go to the Red Robin's in Rancho Cucamonga, and their food is delicious. I expected the same here in Chino, but I had an upsetting experience. First my daughters Mac and cheese seemed less appetizing, and she had a tough time finishing it. She loves mac and cheese more then any other, but she didn't seem to be enjoying it after having a couple of bites. My wife noticed it was watery, and a bit discolored. I ordered the Whiskey River BQQ burger, and by the time I ate half of it I felt my stomach starting churning. I also had the buffalo wings appetizer, but my wife ate them as well and felt fine. After eating half of my burger, and finishing my fries I felt queasy. I headed to the bathroom with my 3 year old because she had said she felt sick as well, and I had thought maybe she would vomit (she didn't). I ended up vomiting almost all of food. Coming back to my table, and seeing my burger made me feel worse. The waiter came to ask if I wanted a box, and I told him that I had become sick from eating my burger; that I wasn't going to take it home with me. He simply apologized for me becoming sick, and removed my burger from the table. After taking my burger I tried settling my stomach down a bit, but once again I went to the restroom to vomit some more. Returning to my table my wife told me the waiter came back to ask if I was alright, and brought me a Ginger-Ale. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of my waiter. He apologized, and brought me something to ease my stomach. I am not happy that I paid full price for half a burger that made me sick. I'm not the type to make a scene, and I'm a very patient man. My waiter was nice, and I don't blame him for my food making me sick, but I just wish more could have been done. I will not be coming here again, and will not recommend this Red Robin's to my friends either.

The servers are friendly, and they're always very apologetic for the bouts of waiting, but I mean..that doesn't change the fact that service is slow. If you come here when it's slow though, you might not mind as much because they really do make great burgers. The temp of my medium burger is always right with just a hint of pink, and not over-done like so many other burger joints. The steak fries are hot and burn-your-mouth delicious, so be careful and don't forget to sprinkle on their house seasoning salt (available at purchase at the front and no they don't pay me to say that). Wash it all down with their freckled lemonade or their root beer float, both bottomless! So yes, come here, but to speed things alot, make sure you know what you wanna order, and put in an order of fries as soon as the waitress will allow haha.

Mel B.,"Pomona, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Unfortunately there is no ZERO star rating here, otherwise they would have gotten it. My wife, got a coupon through her email saying she gets to have a free burger of some sort. The small print was, with the order of an entree and two drinks. Which is fine as we went together and I was going to order something for myself. But again this is Red Robin and everything on the menu is ho-hum.  So, I decided to order a large order of buffalo chicken wings. Before I placed the order, I showed our server the email coupon and she acknowledged that, she knew about it. When we finished eating and I wanted to pay the  bill, I noticed the burger was not taken off. Called our server and she said it is only valid with an entree and the large order (more expensive then most burgers on the menu) was just an appetizer.  She could have warned me about this situation before placing my order and I would happily order a burger or a salad. When I made this point she went inside to talk to the manager abut came back with the same story. Paying $6.99 for a crappy burger is not going to kill me but I will make everything in my power to kill as much business as possible for them from now on. If it is her oversight, maybe she needs to be more attentive and management should correct their employees' mistakes to prevent bad publicity.  If it is the management's decision to prevent the servers from warning people so that they can not use the coupons sent to them, it is chicken excrement and they deserve to lose business till they have to shut the place down. I was not a happy camper tonight and will not be returning to Red Robin again.

They change the old garlic fries now they have more herbs on them and seasoning. I was a bigger fan of the old ones.

Natalie G.,"Chino, CA",1,26,9,3.0,1/1/2017,I'd give them more stars but lately they've been quite mediocre. My family and I frequent this location because our three boys under the age of 11 enjoy eating here and it's loud enough so they don't have to be so quiet. While most of the staff is friendly and nice there are times when it's not the best service. Like yesterday afternoon. When we sat down we ordered drinks they came out fairly quickly. But then we said we needed a minute to order and then the waitress didn't come back for a very long time. When she did return to take our order our order came out also fairly quickly. However my son's meal was supposed to be 9 pieces it was only 6. She bought the extra 3 pieces in a small cup. My fries and my mother in laws fries were cold. my husband got a Whiskey River wrap that was a quarter of the size it usually is and had no lettuce in it or very little I should say. When we showed it to our waitress who corrected my husband and told him there's lettuce there's just very little she took it to the back and the chef just shoved lettuce in the front of it. I wish I would have took a picture because it was a damn shame red robin is much better than they performed yesterday. Across from us we noticed another Booth calling our waitress over which they pulled a very long hair from their food. The manager did visit their table not sure what was said because you could not hear. As I walk out by the kitchen we could see a few people working back there. One was the young lady with very ratty hair coming out of the back of her hat. I think she needed to have a hairnet at the least.

We all ordered salads instead of the french fries. What I didn't know, was that you could basically have bottomless orders of the salad since we opted for it instead. I got the bacon cheeseburger. It was cooked exactly like I ordered it...well done. Everyone seemed pleased with their meals. I added a tall beer tonight. Now it was louder than average in here and there were a couple small children crying but that's kids. So basically, everything was good. But for me, there was nothing special or over the top here...just average, so for me, just 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=80

The fries are also good, so that is no problem. I did feel a bit disappointed with the fried clams I ordered, they were not very appealing and I probably should have ordered a burger at that time instead. Regarding drinks, I had the skinny margarita, which tasted like a watered-down margarita, but not all that bad (which is probably why they call it skinny).

Binh T.,"San Gabriel, CA",375,652,2076,4.0,7/18/2012,"This Red Robin is by far my most liked location. Let me tell you why.  BOTTOMLESS is the most talked word at Red Robin's, so it will also be so in my review. If you never been to a Red Robin, your fries are BOTTOMLESS, meaning you can get as much fries as you want with your order. On top of that, so are their drinks, even the specialty drinks like their famous Freckled Lemonade (strawberry lemonade with strawberry slices). So, drink up that lemonade because it's BOTTOMLESS.  My top 3 burgers from here (in order) are:  1) Guacamole Bacon Burger. I love guacamole in a burger! Need i really to say more? 2) Whiskey River BBQ Burger. I don't normally like barbecue sauce, but in this burger, I'll take it.  3) Sauteed 'Shroom Burger. It's all about them mushrooms. I like mushrooms. And so does my boyfriend. Therefore, I like mushrooms more.   For you couples, best friends forever, or not-much-of-an-eater, you can ask your server to have the burger split in half. My boyfriend and I usually request this because these burgers are BIG and with BOTTOMLESS fries, half does the job. One of the things I didn't know until a year or so after of coming here often is that you can substitute your fries with other sides. Salads, coleslaw, and steamed broccoli is free of charge. Other items such as their mac n cheese costs additional. But regardless, whichever side you get, it is also BOTTOMLESS.  But why this location? See, whenever I come here, my whole party will get a Freckled Lemonade and they'll only charge me for one because the rest, our server considers as BOTTOMLESS refills. You can bet I tip my server well! In addition, our server always brings out baskets of fries while we're waiting for our burgers. Now that's some service.  Huge parking lot and lots of stores in the same plaza. Right off the freeway, too.  RED ROBINNNNN!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=100

There were only three other tables occupied so we decided to sit in one of the half-booths next to the bar. There was still plates and cups on the table from previous customers but it has never been a problem before. We sat there for five minutes and watched six different people walk by us at least five times each and no one even acknowledged our presence. After a few more minutes of this we decided to attempt to just get a table in the regular dining area. We put our name in with the Jessica the hostess and sat down. We watched as three groups come in after we put our name in, two of them also parties of two, and were seated before us. I went up to the hostess and asked if there was a problem with me or my wife and explained what had happened. She said there was no problem and said she could seat us right away.

The strawberry lemonade and mint brownie shake are YUMMY SCRUMBOES and are two things I will always get everytime.  Service: I came here on a Wednesday night and it was unbelievably busy! Not only was about every table filled, but when I was leaving at around 8pm, a huge party was coming in. However, I would have to give service a 4/5 because our waitress was incredibly nice under all that pressure. She was one of those people who knows what to do on nights like these. Instead of bringing out one refill of lemonade at a time, she would bring out two to stay ahead of herself and to keep her customers happy. I do need to knock off a star though because the food came out so slow. Yes, they were busy, but I've seen busier and nicer restaurants work faster in the kitchen. No excuse.  Food: meh. I'm never impressed with their food. Their burgers are thoughtfully made, but maybe I'm just impartial to greasy American food. Though I do enjoy their burger with the egg in it. So good! During this visit, I opted for the Red White and Bleu salad. Yup. Definitely not impressed. The salad was a regular mix of iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots and cabbage with honey mustard dressing, candied walnuts and Bleu cheese, and a chicken breast that did not seem natural. I could've gone to the store and bought the same ingredients and still have made it better.  Overall: I'm glad they changed the look of their menu because the old one was out dated.

My experiences dining at this location has been pretty a-okay. Parking can be a bit difficult to find during the weekends, because there is also an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant that shares the same parking lot. The wait time can extend to about 20-30 minutes long during the weekends, but the host/hostess has been courteous and polite upon the arrival of customers. The interior of the restaurant is colorful, decorative, and clean. Make sure to watch your step when entering to sit in and exiting from the booths because there is a step. The servers are friendly and come by frequently to ask if you need anything else. Their beef patties are cooked however you would like them to be cooked. I highly suggest trying their D.G.B. burger, which may or may not be a limited-timed menu item. I am not so sure. But, it is so delicious and full of flavor that you will not be disappointed! After dining, the server will ask you if you prefer to pay the bill by cash or card and there is even a convenient tablet on the table that will allow you to quickly pay the bill by card. Overall, the food is tasty but the prices are a bit up there in my opinion. However, on a positive note, this restaurant is a great place to grab a drink, watch sports, or catch up with friends.

Candace O.,"Ontario, CA",117,46,54,3.0,1/2/2015,"I've been to this location several times and lately my experiences have been going downhill. A couple of years ago, I would come with a group of friends at any time and be seated in no longer than ten minutes. It seems like business has picked up since then or maybe everybody craves a Red Robin burger the same time as I do. It just always seems so busy. I came in this evening to have dinner with my family. The wait wasn't too long. Our server came to take our drink order right away, but never introduced herself. After a few minutes we got our drinks, then we placed our orders. Fifteen minutes passed by and we saw a couple of tables that we're seated after us get their order before us. Then ten minutes later our food was here. The guy that brought us our food confused one of our burgers by calling it by the other name of our burgers and that was a bit frustrating. The taste of our food was amazing. I love Red Robin's burgers and their bottomless fries. I'm sad that the bottomless fries are half the portion that they used to be. We had all finished our burgers, while holding back a little and were still waiting on our second batch of fries. By then we didn't want it because there was nothing to eat it with. Also, our server wasn't as friendly, maybe she was just overwhelmed with her multiple tables, not sure. In the past, all of our servers were friendly and had recommendations, but times have changed. We only came because we had a gift card and it being Friday evening, we wanted to go out. I was hoping for a better experience since the last time, but I'm slightly disappointed. The food is the only thing that I'd come back for with hopefully better service. I wouldn't want to stop by for a while based off tonight. It makes me sad to write a review like this, but I was a true Red Robin fan and would recommend this restaurant to others because of the great food and service I had received. Not anymore.

Cheri S.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",46,22,3,3.0,2/8/2015,"I will start by saying that the manager tried really really hard to make it right.  She came to our table to apologize personally, she didn't charge for the burgers and she offered to bring us extras.   The last time we were at a Red Robin was 2009 just before we moved from Nashville, TN.  The main reason we hadn't been back for a while was that there was not a Red Robin very close to where we were living until we moved out to the Inland Empire last year.  A much more minor reason was that we are simple burger people.  We don't eat cheeseburgers, and Red Robin is so much about the toppings.  We always felt like we were paying for topping we were asking to hold.    But, we remembered it as a super delicious if very indulgent meal. Then a couple weeks ago we saw an ad for the Keep it Simple burger.  This, plus the fact that my brother-in-law had been talking about going to Red Robin with his family in St. Louis led my husband to develop a hankering for Red Robin.  Unfortunately, this time, the burgers were a big disappointment.  As we were waiting for our burgers, I thought about the fact that I did not remember the waiter asking us how we wanted our meat cooked.  (We generally order medium).  The burgers came shortly after, and they were charred.  So much so that the waiter said, ""wow, those look overcooked"" when we took off the top buns.  I even considered the possibility that it was just the grill marks from the open flame, but when I took a bite of mine, it tasted burnt.  The waiter immediately offered to replace the burgers without us even having to ask and, as I stated above, the manager came over to apologize.  The next burgers were not charred, but, unfortunately, were still not particularly good.     As I said, we are simple burger people.  All we want from a restaurant burger is for it to be thick and juicy.  Juicy with the meat juice running down your fingers as you eat it.  This was not that.  This was a bland, dry, unimpressive patty.  If your name is ""...Gourmet Burgers"" you have to do the burgers well...even the plain ones.   i have to blame corporate.  Either there was a corporate decision at some point to skimp on the meat or there was a training problem, but either way chains should be about consistent quality across locations.  I know the problem was not lack of effort on the part of the waiter or manager.   On the bright side, the fries were good as always.  We love that we can opt for the bottomless fruit salad.  Gives the ""freckled"" flavor in a much fresher and healthier way.  We also love the choices on the kids menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=140

The evening began with my wife and I showing up around 8. The place was a little crowded and we were told it was gonna be a 20 minute wait. During the wait, I walked back to use the restroom and there were open tables all over the place. So, why did they make us wait? The restroom is another story on it's own. They didn't have any paper towels, except for the ones littered all over the counters and floor. It smelt awful and the urinal was covered in pee stains.  After we finally got seated, our waitress was anything but polite. She had a very big attitude and was not personable at all. One thing that really disturbed me though. When she brought out our silverware, the napkin had a huge, cold, brown stain like someone had dipped it in coke.  The only reason I am giving it two starts is because the food wasn't half bad. As I said above, I love me some Red Robin. Although, I probably won't be any wear near this one again.  My suggestion would be to go eat somewhere else. There is a lot of restaurants on that block.

I am a fan of their strawberry lemonade. I hope they never change their formula. Their burger combinations are vast to suit many varying tastes. They serve huge portions so you'll never walk away hungry, but I will say the burger patty itself isn't superb or bad. Its just , well, ok. After prettyfying it with toppings, usually comes out pretty good.  Ask for a basket of fries to start. Try their fries well done with a side of honey mustard and ranch, I cant ever decide which dressing I like better.  Most of  non-burger items are that great. I've had soups, fish tacos, the wraps but none of those were worth a second try. BUT I will say the crispy chicken sandwich (almost all variations), battered/fried arctic cod sandwich, and chicken strips are all delicious.

Ellen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",468,474,148,3.0,10/25/2010,"I usually really like eating at Red Robin but my latest visit was only worthy of 3 stars. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It's pretty much a regular hamburger with shoestring onion rings + bbq sauce. I liked the onion rings in it. The onions are sliced really thin so you can really only taste the fried batter. Pretty good. I think my hamburger was missing the bbq sauce though. I could barelyyy taste it at all and I had to ask for a side of it to put on my burger. Maybe this hamburger is meant to taste like this, but it was a little too flavorless for me.  They have a large assortment of burgers. I probably wouldn't get the Whiskey River bbq burger again but a lot of the other ones sound good. All the burgers come with bottomless fries, which is a huge plus. But service was pretty horrible this day and we had to ask 3x before they gave us another basket of fries.

After about a year of not eating red robin, I decided to give this place another chance. The food was never a problem. The Bonzai Burger is always a good choice or the crispy chicken tender salad if you aren't in the mood for a burger. Basically, whatever you like, you should be able to find on the menu here.  The service has gotten better, but I think the key is to sit in their bar area.

You can basically feed a group of four by just ordering multiple orders of those two! The last time I went I had a grilled chicken sandwich (technically it's a burger no matter how you look at it), it had good calories and sodium count (thank good for nutritional values on their menus!) since I'm looking for ways to lower my sodium intake. It was very simple, it had your tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, pickles and slab of grilled chicken. The chicken was very moist and tender. It had a lot of juice in it that it was dripping when I took the first bite. That's when you know you have a good piece of chicken in your hand! But what I love most is their fries (I didn't eat much, but still so delicious!) They're large and not an anorexic looking fry that some restaurant serve and it's always perfectly fried so that it's not so much just the crispy part, but they had a good amount of the potato in there. The freckled lemonade is also one of the things that makes me return time and time again... I like their use of real strawberries at the bottom and tangy flavor of the lemonade isn't overwhelming so that your face isn't stuck permanently in a squished 'too-sour' kind of expression.

Kione E.,"San Jose, CA",321,693,402,1.0,10/29/2009,"Weekend. Lunch time. Joining friends/family for lunch before heading over to our golf lessons in Pomona. A Red Robins or any type of chain restaurant would not be my choice of places to have lunch, but since that's where the friends/family chose to have lunch at, that's where we were. 7+1 child. We get there and friends/family are seated and already reading the menu. I heard that the burgers are pretty good, so I took a look at the menu to see what choices they had. It didn't take too long to figure out what I wanted. About 10 minute goes by. When the kid-waiter-dude finally got to us to take our drink orders, but we were ready to order lunch as well. So, he went about in an orderly fashion receiving our requests. We had a lot of question and he pretty much had all the answers. Not too bad...so far. When he gets to me, I ask for the Red Robin Bacon Cheeseburger, rare, cheddar w/ fries. Kid-waiter-dude informs me that they ""cannot"" cook their burgers rare, but can cook it medium rare. ""What? Really?"" I asked. He gave me some spiel about health code and other crap. I translated it to: ""The quality of out meat product is crap, and just so that we don't get a law suit on our hands, we will cook you meat as much as possible. Thank you."" sigh.... pause... I wasn't happy. ""Alright, medium rare...if you have to."" I said. ""And some coffee please. Thanks."" And, off he went to place the order. About 10 minutes goes by... ...and no one has their drinks yet. Although, we see kid-waiter-dude running around taking orders from his other tables. There must be some runner bringing us our drinks, I think to myself. Finally, our drinks show up. Question: Do you want to know when I think the coffee is crap? Answer: I use a lot of sugar and cream. I used a lot of sugar and cream. It is part if my nature...that has been ingrained into me as a former restaurant/bar GM...to observe and access my surroundings. This is what I saw: Servers with more tables than then can effectively handle. It was the weekend and lunchtime...and this location is surrounded by shopping malls. Lack of runners. The floor manager pacing near the line, trying to look busy... ,,,and some prick who was most likely the GM or worst DM walking around with a stupid smile on his face and empty eyes, trying to chat with some of the servers and runners who were running around frantically, trying to do their jobs. I flagged a server down for a refill of coffee. Now, the thing that really irritated me was: 1) I was hungry. 2) Everything was taking longer than it really needed to be. 3) The prick  GM (or DM) decided...in the middle of the fucking lunch rush, that it was time for a team prep-speech. Are you fricken' kidding me? DM...it had to be. Only a DM of a chain restaurant can be SO stupid. I really don't know what was being said, but the crew was responding with practiced shout, claps and cheers. Kind of like when you command your dog to speak, for a treat. But, without the wagging tail to show it's excitement. Dogs can't lie. Afterward, the crew broke from their huddle, most looking annoyed and went back to their tasks. Just as I was about to flag a server for another coffee refill, our food shows up...on the cooler side of warm. Damn, it's been sitting around waiting to be picked-up and delivered. And...my burger was medium. Question: You want to know when I think a burger sucks? Answer: When I use a LOT of ketchup. Yup, I used a lot of ketchup for that burger. Yup.

Andrea L.,"Chino, CA",3,30,3,1.0,6/26/2015,"I RARELY write any reviews but i had to write one this time. I was dining here with my family after work and was not prepared for the terrible service I received. To start off we had a waitress named Michelle P. ...it was a long wait to get seated to begin with and an even longer wait to place an order. Upon ordering she kept trying to sell us on different menu items than what we already wanted which was annoying enough. I ordered a Whisky BBQ wrap to share with my other sibling. The appetizer also took forever to come out.  Anyway, once we received our food, I noticed our wrap was gross...It was completely DRENCHED in BBQ sauce....had NO lettuce in it which it was supposed to have, and no ranch...It was disgusting and barely inedible as it was soaking wet in BBQ sauce...I managed to flag down our waitress after she ignored us for a good 20 minutes after our food came, along with forgetting my other siblings ranch sauce which we ordered in the beginning. I flagged the waitress down and explained to her in a nice way that there was no lettuce and way too much sauce in the wrap, she gave me a rude look and took half of the wrap away and told us she had to ""show them"" .....okay ? even if u had to show them we weren't eating them, and for the money you pay to eat out I just wanted it re made right? Our waitress disappeared after that and scoffed off with an attitude. more time went by and a nicer waitress who wasnt the original one we had brought out our food. Our waitress Michelle P , never bothered to 1. apologize 2. never asked if everything was better 3. never asked us for refills or anything. I was particularly bothered because I work in customer service and I was offended at her rudeness and would never treat a customer that way ever no matter what. She finally came by 20 more min later to ask if it was right, then quickly sped off before I could get a word in and asked her for a side of ranch....she rushed an said ""yeah"" and walked off with an attitude again. 10 minutes later she returned ""THROWING THE RANCH AT ME ON THE TABLE QUICKLY"" and walked away with the attitude never asking or saying to me but actually tossing it at me on the table, my family and I looked at each other and wondered how anyone could be that rude....I was so upset....We soon received the bill only to realize that she once again messed up our bill and overcharged us....(probably on purpose) , we waited another 20 minutes later because their manager had to correct it, Again the waitress was RUDE telling us we only have 4 points now on our rewards, and threw the bill on the table not even apologizing. I have NEVER experienced customer service this bad in my entire life, No one told her to work there. I feel bad for whoever else has her as a waitress. I don't think I will be returning to this location. I would've talked to a manager if everything hadn't already taken 2 hours but I was tired and wanted to leave. It was terrible. It was so bad that the people next to us were complaining  to the manager about how their Shrimp was hard as a rock!

Linda Y.,"Irvine, CA",372,549,21,4.0,5/22/2009,"In high school, I used to be able to eat a burger and the side of fries, and probably 3-4 more baskets of fries WITH a freckled lemonade. I was such a beast! I wish I could eat that much now T_T I obviously love the fries and love dipping them in various sauces. You HAVE to try the poppy seed honey mustard dressing. I also like to order ranch and add ketchup and a few dashes of that Red Robin seasoning. Have you ever looked at the sodium content? It's out of control but it's so good.  I usually get the 5 alarm burger or the mushroom burger, but this time I ordered blackened bayou burger. It was decent. It has coleslaw, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and a chipotle aioli.

Burgers and fries.   Service. Now this is where there chain restaurants fail most of the time but for my visit. It surprisingly did not. My strawberry lemonade was always full and the waitress made sure to check on us but not be bothersome.

rachel p.,"Chino Hills, CA",5,14,14,1.0,5/31/2013,"I usually LOVE Red Robin but I'm writing this review because of the horrible experience I've had here today. Not with the food, but with the service. The husband and I decided to grab a late lunch. My husband ordered a beer for us to share. Our waitress Noelle asked for his ID which never really happens as my husband looks older than 21. When he took his ID out we realized his licenses was expired (by less than a month). I took my licenses out so we could get the beer and I even mentioned to our waitress several times that we would be sharing the beer! Not once did she say he wouldn't be able to drink because of his expired licenses! The licenses expired but his age didn't! Nonetheless, if she would have informed us that legally he wasn't allowed to drink we would have abided by the law! We wouldn't want to get anyone in trouble! Instead she sent the manager over to tell us my husband couldn't share my beer (which he only had a few sips!)! We had no idea it was a problem because again my husbands DOB clearly shows he is over 21! Expired or not. Again, if the waitress who I told we would be sharing would had said something to us at the beginning it would all have been avoided! Instead she completely avoided our table. When we finally flagged someone down and asked for the check she sent other servers to collect payment! I have never felt so uncomfortable! To make matters worse she obviously was still attending our section as she went to every table but ours! I asked to speak with the manager as this situation did not sit well with me! I explained we had no idea he couldn't drink as his birthday isn't invalid and he was over 21 and they had served me the beer! Noelle neglected to tell her manager I had mentioned we would be sharing the beer and (And AGAIN!) she never said we legally couldn't. The manager really couldn't do anything to make the situation better at that point but did say if I had bad service I should tip accordingly. I've never not tip! I usually over tip but today I left her $0! Considering she didn't do anything but take our order and make us feel uncomfortable I feel it was only fair! She completely mishandled the situation.

Shauna B.,"Chino Hills, CA",92,40,2,5.0,4/2/2013,"Since joining the Red Royalty Club last month, I have been finding excuses to go to Red Robin. Recently, I treated my children (age 14 & 12) to lunch. During our order, I also put in a to-go order for my mom. We ate our delicious lunch and my to-go order arrived the same time as my bill. After paying my bill, my husband texted me that he, too, wanted me to bring home lunch for him. Noelle graciously took my last second request and put it in immediately. Bonus for me: it was free, thanks to my Red Royalty card. As we sat waiting for our last order, I realized I inadverdantly ordered my husband's burger with a regular bun instead of the available Gluten Free bun! His order was almost completed by the time I notified the kitchen my huge mistake. Noelle and the (female) manager got out the ""allergy book"" so I could verify the ingredients in his burger and quickly stopped the order and revised my request. I'm am certain they had to make a new burger. The male manager on duty was the one who ""stopped the presses"" and made sure all allergens were tended to. He soon brought out my husbands order and I apologized profusely for my mistake. He assured me that everything was okay and wished me a wonderful rest of my day. I appreciate Noelle, and the two managers quick response and how they painstakingly made certain my husband's order was correct. I really wish I had ascertained their names!!

Jamie F.,"Chino, CA",43,90,25,5.0,3/10/2010,"This is a great place for families.  I have a 3 year old boy and we go on Tuesday nights because we know ""Red Robin"" is going to be there to greet the kids.  The food is always good and who doesn't love all you can eat fries.  I do have one downfall.  I never know what to order because I love everything there.  Also I'm so stuffed after my dinner that I never have room for dessert.  I've also joined their birthday club and I got a free burger for my birthday.  That was a great plus.  Red Robin never goes wrong and the employees here are attentive and always get us what we need.  My favorites on the menu are the Chicken Ceasar Wrap and Clam Chowder Soup, the Royal Red Robin Burger, and the Fish and Shrimp Duo.  Like I said everything is good, but If I had to choose my top 3 those would be it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=280
Yi E.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,21,,4.0,6/24/2010,"been there a few times, always have good service with friendly waiter/waitress. Food is pretty decent also, sometimes it can take a while for food/drink to come out. But overall pretty decent with service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=280
D M.,"Chino, CA",1,62,3,5.0,1/22/2010,"A new favorite in our house!! I've had RR randomly throughout the years, but over the last few months, the one in Chino has become a weekly must! It started with an obsession with the Gingerbread shakes YUMM!!.. and endless steak fries... wow!! but we've always had great and friendly service which keeps us coming back. Plus, my little munchkin loves talking to ""Red"" on Tuesday and Thursday nights..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=300
Darren Y.,"Pasadena, CA",132,100,516,4.0,7/19/2006,"I know you haven't tried every single burger on their menu. I have, and they're all worth the the $8-9 each. You can't beat bottomless steak fries either. Maybe it's just this Chino location but they have consistently good service and food. The wait time here (Friday, Saturday nights esp) may be longer than most so keep that in mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino?start=300
