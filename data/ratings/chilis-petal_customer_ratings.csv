5,Scott H.,"Clinton, MS",3,4,2.0,4.0,2014-03-01,"Good service. Ate at the bar and the bartender was great despite being very busy. I had the carribean salad, margarita and chips. Good quality",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
7,Randall H.,"New Augusta, MS",3,5,1.0,4.0,2014-04-21,"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Chili's bar and Grill in Petal MS is a great place to stop eat and enjoy good company with friends and family, we go there often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
4,Jennifer R.,"Hattiesburg, MS",2,9,2.0,5.0,2015-05-28,"I love the Petal location.  Staff is very friendly, eager to please, and the building stays clean.  #1 place the family likes to eat at.  ToGo orders are always on time which makes getting lunch during the week easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
3,Dennis B.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,20,16.0,1.0,2015-08-13,"As with any restaurant - sometimes if you hit them up an hour before close you may get less than desirable food. Went in to the Petal location and noticed there were only 6 customers in the place at 9P. Went ahead and ordered food. Appetizers were about a 4 out of 10, but we decided to get the fajitas and once they arrived it just didn't smell right and the chicken and steak were way undercooked and one fajita plate had a hair on the chicken. Will not return to this location, as it just didn't seem like a tight operation managed well - but it may not be so horrific if you go during prime time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
6,Phillip D.,"Laurel, MS",0,1,,3.0,2016-01-07,"I have been to this location about 4-5 times and it is always very good.  But today was different. We ordered the Fajitas (like always) and ate all the tortillas.  We asked for more and it took the kitchen around 20-25 mins to get us our tortillas (Yes you heard me. 20-25mins for tortillas).  But the waiter was very nice and tried to help as much as possible.  So it was really the kitchens fault.  This location is always very good, so that is why I made a exception and didn't leave one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
2,Marlon M.,"Honolulu, HI",103,35,14.0,3.0,2016-02-17,"This place is kind of hit or miss, my last visit was good. The food was tasty & service was great but the cleanliness of the tables fell beneath the mark. It was not crowded when we arrived but yet all the tables were dirty. We moved from our original seating and at that point just decided to clean it off ourselves. Overall satisfied but it will be a while before I return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
1,Michael D.,"Petal, MS",9,26,4.0,5.0,2016-03-14,I can't think of a bad order I've had yet. The best entree(s) I've had so far are the Tacos (both prime rib and carnitas). I never thought I'd get good tacos from Chilis. The staff are extremely friendly and good at what they do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
0,Lee S.,"Denver, CO",2,2,2.0,5.0,2018-01-04,"By far, hands down the best Chili's I've ever eaten at and I love Chili's. The service is impeccable. The food is always hot. Sherry is the best waitress I've ever had also. Ask for her in the bar area if you visit. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-petal,,,,,
