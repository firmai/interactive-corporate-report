Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",3576,1312,9473,4.0,11/11/2011,2 for $20 Cheese sticks Sirloin steak veggies baked potatoes Asian salad with chicken Where can 2.5 people eat for 20 bucks? Here!!!  Current promotion let's you pick one app and two entrees for 20.  We started out with the cheese sticks.  Which were really good!!!  They also came out not super hot which was good because our little one was there.  This was her first cheese stick. We are either good or bad parents!  I wanna say good because we waited 5 years for this moment.  She really liked them...I can't blame her!!! Then for our entrees we had the oriental salad with chicken and the sirloin with vegetables and baked potato.  We honestly had too much food.  We could hardly finish it. Everything was really good.  Also a large Miller Lite on tap was 3 bucks.  Now that is a deal!!! Our waitress was also really good too.  She went out of her way to make our meal enjoyable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
K P.,"Oak Park, IL",0,44,3,1.0,9/19/2014,"I am being generous when I give this Applebee's  one star. I came into establishment. No one waited on me for over 15 mins. On a Wed. night, it was not crowded How pathetic. Don't go there unless you are into poor treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Tishawn F.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,205,113,3.0,7/6/2010,"I cant seem to give anymore than a half ass review for chain restaurants..Sorry but there isnt much you can say other than about the customer service , the location and the things you either hate or love about the location.. With this said ill just start off with saying that if you're a vegetarian then i suggest you find some place else to go. I was with my mom and going to an Indian buffet was out of the question for a 70 year old black women from the   mom loves meat and ever since ive been a vegetarian ive been trying to convince her to stop.. oh well, i had to compromise today with applebee's. Location: right next to Denny's in the Menards plaza.They also have a petsmart and a copy place i forgot the name of.Located across from the entrance of Gurnee mills. Customer service was great..that also could be because nobody was in there.They never left us without  and service always came with a smile. Great place to go with good meat selections.. a few too many if you ask me.A handful of veggie selections and im not talking about the salads either.I think all of them had meat in them. I wont be going back but it was a great place to spend the day with my mother after shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Richie D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",2043,1175,7611,4.0,10/15/2008,"Yes, I'm aware it's a chain restaurant.  Usually that pushes me away, but what can you expect for a Chicago suburb--especially one like Gurnee.  However, I always enjoy coming here.   To drink I go with the raspberry or strawberry SYRUP iced tea (not the nasty Lipton's Raspberry Tea off the ""tap"").  What keeps me coming back for more are the TASTY, FRESH, UNIQUE salad options.  I can't get enough of their Oriental Chicken Salad that has the crunchy chicken and Asian noodles with a tangy dressing.  Or, I also recommend the grilled Shrimp'N Spinach salad.  Both are delectable!  For an appetizer, get the sweet Honey BBQ dipped Chicken Boneless Buffalo Wings.  You can't go wrong with that. With the deteriorating economy, many restaurants are offering good lunch deals--It's about time!!  Applebee's follows the trend and offers the Pick'N Pair lunch special Mondays thru Fridays before 3 pm.  This bargain includes your double choice of either a soup or salad or sandwich/pasta for $5.99.  For $1.99 (usually $4.99) you can also add the perfect-sized (not too much to make you feel like one of your pants buttons will pop) dessert shooters (sounds dirty, but it is similar to a larger-sized shot glass filled with sweet delights).  See!  This is why I love Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Matthew W.,"Aurora, IL",2,34,18,3.0,4/2/2011,"This is your basic Applebee's Grill.  The service was fine and the food was as to be expected.  We had an early dinner on a Friday night and did not have to wait for a table. I had the wild idea to try the ""Southwest Jalapeno Burger"" and it was quite fiery !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Stanley I.,"Chicagoland, IL",35,20,,3.0,6/10/2010,Pretty much what you expect from a chain restaurant. I recommended the nearby tgif but the family wanted otherwise. We ordered their appetizer and 2 entree deal and the portions were disappointing. I don't order Applebees but if you liked them before you'll probably like their Gurnee location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Julio H.,"Waukegan, IL",0,4,,2.0,10/18/2012,"Its not what it used to be, been to this location twice first time it was good second was like the wife said to cry. Service was nice but being a family restaurant i'm there  for the food unlike tilted kilt where your there for the"" ambiance"". Food was bad even the kids meal was bad, no flavor just salty food. I'm not picky when eating, should've just gone to golden corral where even though the food might be in the warmers for a while, at least I know there's variety without having to pay more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Critic L.,"New York, NY",0,73,1,1.0,2/1/2013,"Food is decent but the entire staff are kids. Would have like to see a responsible adult. Ordered bottled wine only to be told later that the particular one is not available by bottle, picked another only to be informed that they ran out of wine glasses...has to ask twice for silverware while my starter sat cold in front of me.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
Edwin M.,"Gurnee, IL",0,59,1,3.0,3/14/2010,"This is the local Applebee's for me.  Compared to other Applebee's restaurants it is fairly average.  The food is decent and prices are reasonable.  Service in the restaurant has improved greatly from a few years ago. The system they have for take out is awkward.  When placing an order, they ask what kind of car you will be driving.  Instead of entering the restaurant, one waits in one's car in specially designated parking spaces.  The system breaks down because there is no acknowledgment of one's arrival.  The person delivering the orders is not able to make change on the spot nor does s/he have a way of taking credit cards on the spot.  Several trips back and forth are required to complete the transaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gurnee
