Toria D.,"Canton, MI",327,9,,4.0,10/21/2017,This is a pretty good Friday's restaurant. Service is always good and the food is always hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Nina M.,"Detroit, MI",315,428,244,1.0,9/24/2017,"After several dine in visits and a couple of carry outs I can say that the service has become inconsistent whether busy or not.  Bartenders: there are 2 regular bartenders that are very attentive. A young lady and a guy named Rob. Anybody else and it's hit or miss.  Dine-in: servers have always been attentive when I have dined in regularly with family.  Carry out/online: check you order throughly before leaving. Neither of the 2 orders I've placed were accurate and I don't understand how it's possible to mess a standard sandwich with deletions and a change of cheese.  Still better than Dearborn or Southfield, but stellar. I'd still come to this location to have a cocktail in the bar area. However, after mindlessly not checking my online order, getting home to is being wrong and having to make a drive back I'm not impressed with the back of the house. Only reason I would dine here would be to use the remainder of my points that I have for free food. Friday's across Metro Detroit are becoming sub-par:(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Aaron A.,"Canton, MI",62,122,2,1.0,3/2/2017,"One of the worst experiences, if not THE worst, of any time I've been at this location. The food (steaks) was sent back not once, but twice, then the 3rd time (sizzling chicken), one of the breasts was scorched burnt. Rachel, the manager, took only 20% off the bill, even after I asked her to remove it fully. (Chicken is the most expensive item on that plate and half was burnt up...tell me how this makes sense.) Rachel has been there for awhile, her employees are already not fond of her, and now, her managerial skills are falling apart....she needs to go. I come in here more than most ppl (once or twice a week, on average), and this lack of customer service is unacceptable. This was to the point of blatant disrespect. The servers and bartenders have ALWAYS shown great service for me. This review is NOT about any of them. I tipped above 20% on the pre-discounted bill so this was not some money issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Ryan W.,"Westland, MI",1,8,,1.0,11/16/2017,Horrible horrible horrible! The worst service I've ever had!!!  Food was cold and over done. I'll never be back here again! Should have stuck with chillis where the food and service is always good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Kellie C.,"Dearborn, MI",79,143,165,4.0,2/3/2017,"This review gets four stars for its consistency in food taste and offering a trendy variety of menu options.  Just a go to for an after shopping treat or some takeout. In this visit, the server was efficient and the regional winner in TGI Fridays mixologist contest. He show off some expert flipping of the shaker and tossing drink moves. Come to canton and check him out sometime.  Got the jack Daniels wings (traditional style) even though I believe they are no longer listed in the menu, they are a long time fav pick. My drink was a margarita with a refreshing Popsicle added.

Alley S.,"Canton, MI",0,4,,1.0,3/4/2017,"The service here is literally terrible.  Ordered something and it came with toppings not listed on the menu-- one of which I'm deathly allergic to. Sent it back stating I would have ordered it without had it stated so on the menu only to have the chef come out and act extremely inconvenienced and inform me it DOES say it on the menu. I went and got one. It didn't. No apology. Nothing. Just attitude.  Tried again a few months later asked for a booth. Was told I couldn't have one because the person whose turn it was didn't have a booth in his area. Tons of empty tables, including booths. We left without eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton

Olivia Z.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",348,5,,1.0,8/15/2017,"If you have four hours to kill this is a great restaurant to go to for dinner. The food is OK. We had a long wait from the start. Bring a sweatshirt because it's really cold here too. There's also plenty of really big butt cracks to look at while you eat. What a great sight. I don't want to totally blame our waiter, I know how it is in the restaurant industry. However, the manager should've been around doing a lot more damage control then I saw her doing. On the plus side, the takeout containers are microwavable and dishwasher safe. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends... I would however recommend this place to all people I don't like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Laura C.,"Milwaukee, WI",55,264,10,5.0,6/18/2016,My goodness.  I had a great experience here!!  I ordered one of the lunch specials with soup and a half sandwich AND a side.  SO tasty and so affordable!  The waitress was so kind and professional.  They were extra helpful and accommodating since I had my baby with me.  I really enjoyed myself and went to a different TGIFridays location a week later!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Kathy P.,"Wayne, MI",9,110,74,3.0,2/15/2016,"Had a great time.  Food was moderate chain restaurant food.  Our waitress Dominique was very attentive to us and our order.  She worked in the bar area. I didn't care much for the hostess as we entered.   Actually there was no one to greet us.  We stood there maybe 5 minutes before this lady came from the bar area.  I asked if the tables open in the bar area is first come first serve and she said no.  There were 4 open tables yet a wait for dining area of 45 minutes.  She asked 2 couples if they wanted wanted to sit at those tables instead of wait for a table in the dining area and of course they said yes.  I proceeded to the bar for a glass of wine and asked the bartender if we could have the empty table that seated 6 cause we were a party of 4 and he said ABSOLUTELY.  He didnt understand why the greeter lady was making us wait for a dining room table.  All the others who were waiting for a table were couples.  After all it was V Day. The establishment itself could use more organization and a complete cleaning.  The first thing you smell when you walk into the bar is bleach.  I hate that.  Makes me think they are hiding a funky odor.   Neither of us used the restaurant restroom so I'm not sure of its cleanliness. I would visit this location again when I'm in the mood for my sizzling chicken and shrimp.  It's in my neighborhood.  The service isn't that bad whereas I would drive long distance to go to another Friday's. Food average, and 2 thumbs up to Dominique and the bartender who offered us seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton
Patrick D.,"Westland, MI",0,21,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"Well, I think I am done going here. I enjoy the endless apps and they are pretty good. Well, apparently their success means they shouldn't be around anymore.  Tgif employs a great new strategy to make people not go anymore. First, shrink the portions down to below child-size. Next, make you wait *forever* for your next refill. After that, make it so cold in the restaurant that you don't wait for those refills. Finally, charge $2 more for all of these great features. Add in a snotty waiter who barely comes around to get plates and refill drinks and you have TGIF in a half full restaurant on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton

I don't eat beef burgers often but when I do I'll definitely be ordering this again!  If you like burgers and have never tried this you gotta stop in at TGIF and try this.

Kevin G.,"Plymouth, MI",50,278,62,2.0,8/8/2016,"My wife and I tried this location out tonight and their Endless Apps promotion. Seated right away by two very nicely dressed young men. Our server, Jess showed up right away. Very friendly and outgoing. She explained the promo rules and took our order. All together we tried the deep fried green beans, the potato skins, the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza, and the pot stickers. All were good. Not great just good. The pot stickers were the best of the bunch. Not too bad for 10 bucks a person. I wish they had a few more choices of apps. But the biggest issue, and the reason this is a 2 star review, started about 20 minutes into our meal. A couple on the other side of the dining room had a small child with them and the child started to cry out quite loudly. THIS WENT ON FOR OVER 20 MINUTES. As you can imagine the other patrons are all looking over at them and wondering why one of the parents did not take the child outside. This is completely the parents fault. I can distinctly remember multiple occasions of leaving a just delivered meal because one of my youngsters was throwing a fit. I also cannot believe the manager did not even attempt to take care of the situation. Completely unacceptable. Might try again but it was not a have to go back kinda meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton

Trina L.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",15,9,12,1.0,3/30/2014,"Ordered a ribeye steak and 10 minutes later, our server informed me that their ribeye steak was frozen and they're unable to serve any at the moment. The manager informed us that they do indeed have the product but it wasn't seasoned so they are unable to sell it. It would have been nice for the kitchen manager to communicate that information with their server (who was awesome, by the way!), that way they can tell customers right off the bat that the product is not available at the moment. I ended up ordering a sirloin steak with shrimp, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. I also ordered a cup of broccoli cheese soup, but when I took a bite, it had a freezer-burnt after taste which was really unpleasant.  I usually love TGIF's but I might not be coming back to this particular location for awhile.

KawaRider88 ..,"Detroit, MI",0,8,9,5.0,10/22/2015,My wife and I have been coming here for a while now. Even before we tied the knot. TGIF in Canton is our go to spot. Its awesome. We save alot of money with the points you earn. The bartenders are the finest. Andy competes nationally and can serve up what ever your heart desires. Dakota is a sweetheart and is a mans bartender. He can serve up one good gin martini. Rob is the bomb. He has cool stories and is someone you could drink with all night. TGIF is deserves more than 5 stars.

We sat there almost 15 min before we were greeted, however I was entertained by the other servers talking about their plans for the night. Finally, we got a server! Put our order in, and the food slowly trickled on the table as it should, but we were missing silverware, plates, dressing, the list goes on. You know there's a problem when the manager is taking and bringing orders, but no worries, the servers are planning their awesome night!  Had to send my sandwich back, it wasn't done the way I ordered it, but it came back missing my side condiments.

M P.,"Washington, MI",62,412,48,2.0,6/3/2016,Short staffed.  Broken. AC in waiting area.  Group after us got same treatment and left.  We should have too.  Took forever to get water.   The crazy part is this is the weekend of the canton cup. The biggest soccer tournament in Michigan. They have it every year so they should be looking forward to it as a business for a busy busy weekend. Instead this place had more than half the restaurant shut off from service at all in the part that was open got very slow and unprofessional service. The young man who was the host had to explain and or argue with several groups of patrons that came in about the seating arrangements or lack there of. Before I left I told our waitress who was nice but not exactly great that they should be trying to see is many people the way the people wanted to be seated as they could. I mean if I own the place I would be wanting to get as much of the money as I could instead of turning people off.  The food we got was pretty good. Then just to burn the point into our brains a group came in as we were leaving and they were going to be seated at three random tables. The woman pointed out that the front room had tables and they could have three together. The staff again refused to see them and started arguing. It was kind of comical because it was so stupid on the part of the Friday staff to argue with potential customers who want to pay them money.  My guess is this location won't be in business very much longer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=20

El Capitan J.,"Plymouth Township, MI",13,17,2,1.0,5/19/2015,"So apparently tonight was ""Zombie Night"" at TGIF and I guess that means they do not acknowledge real LIVE people because we waited at the front for somebody, anybody to greet us and possibly seat us. At least 3 employees saw the 5 of us waiting at the front door a girl behind the bar even waved, I gestured back like is anyone coming to seat us?

Tim K.,"Fraser, MI",261,289,51,2.0,6/29/2011,"Is just me or does this place seem to change their menu at least once a year? It gets frustrating when you go to a place every once in awhile and have something particular in mind to eat and low and behold it's no longer on the menu. I believe their logic is to try and keep things new and fresh, but to me all it's saying is ""we cannot make up our minds"" and leaves me believing that they and others must not like the food they are serving if they are always changing it up.  I wish they would just revert back to how it was a few years ago where the only things new on the menu were the Food Network's ""Ultimate Recipe Showdown"" winners. That made the place unique because you got to see it on the show and instead of thinking ""man that looks good, I wish I could eat it"" you actually could. The service was ""meh"" and it's hard to blame the server entirely because the hostess triple sat her. Granted I worked as a server before and getting triple sat is common and shouldn't be too hard to juggle. She wasn't rude or anything, but seemed distracted and uninterested. It baffles me at how they just ignore you when they know that you are responsible for roughly 80% of their income via tips. The one thing that stood out on the menu that I thought would be good was their Southwest Wedge Salad. I like the concept of the Wedge Salad and this one sounded good, but it was just okay at best. One of the ingredients they use in it is Cilantro which I like, but in moderation and it was if they just took a giant handful of it and dumped it on top and all around the plate. It was just way too much. Another complaint was the dressing. It was good, but there was very little compared to the amount of lettuce and other stuff you got which left the salad a bit on the dry side. I also got half of the California Club sandwich which actually was better then the Salad (I thought it would have been the other way around). I wish I would have just got the full sandwich and not the salad instead of the lunch combo I got. Another WTF issue I had was that even though we came during Happy Hour the only way you could get those food and drink deals is if you sat at the bar. If you wanted to just relax in the dining room say with you kids you were denied the Happy Hour prices. Talk about segregation why don't you. Is this the 1950's again? Sheesh! Forget Fridays and stick to Tuesdays if you are looking for something similar. That is when it comes to places to eat, not the days of the week. The actually day Friday trumps Tuesday hands down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40

(I saw SEVERAL tables beong served their food).  She returned & said there was an error & our order didn't go through to the kitchen.  I said I wanted to leave & asked for the check & the mgr. I told the manager, D'Andre (sp?) Lewis, our story & he was very kind & understanding.  He went to check on our food, which he said he'd comp for us (more waiting), & came back to say the server STILL never put our order through (WTH?!?) so he'd give me vouchers for a free appetizer next time we come in. I'm also disappointed that for over an hour of my time and hunger and all we were offered was a free appetizer card.  At this point, I'm not sure we'll ever go back. Majorly bummed about this experience. AND STILL HUNGRY!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
Jen P.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",0,20,3,5.0,8/23/2013,"LOVE LOVE This place. I go about once a week, would go more but it is far from my house. In fact I pass up the one in Dearborn to go to the Canton location. Food is great, love the stripes rewards and the bartender (Andy) is the shhh-it. Yea, he is cute but I'm married so I just admire from afar lol . No, for real the guy can throw bottles like a champ and does some magic tricks too. Sit in the bar area and hopefully you will get a show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
Liz W.,"Belleville, MI",1533,1111,145,2.0,11/10/2009,"Very meh but again generally a good place to get a tasty mixed drink and a couple appetizers. Not cheap for drinks but they are generally good. We are in the e club and they often send us each a coupon for a penny appetizer at the bar which we both take advantage of and have a discount cocktail hour. The classic buffalo wings here are decent and one of my go to appetizers. The fried green beans work with the wasabi sauce and the pot stickers are nice with extra sauce. The spinach dip is a classic and is usually liked by all. After drinks and apps it all goes downhill though. I usually get a salad and they all seem equally ok. Not stellar, not horrible but not anything you are going to come out specially to get. The sante fe chopped is nice enough. The pecan chicken salad is better at O'Charley's. The Shanghai salad features some of the good potstickers on top so I like it. I have never had a sandwich here I liked so I generally don't pay attention. The pepper crusted pork chop on the right portion, right price menu is a fave of my dad's and it is decent. I do like the idea of that menu but can't seem to get enthused by the selections on it myself. The chicken here is oddly thin in the main dishes, likewise the shrimp is tiny. They also seem to have an obsession with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, the appeal escapes me. The brushetta chicken pasta is my go to dinner and it is good but was better when it came with ciabatta garlic bread. My husband generally gets the sizzling chicken and shrimp with extra cheese on the mashed potatoes. I think the mashed potatoes are the standout in that dish. All in all another place my husband and father dig but I just don't get. It's not awful but I wouldn't go running out to get it either. If you go, stick with apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
BD Traveler R.,"Superior Township, MI",0,72,166,4.0,5/12/2009,"Generally, all of the fast casual dining restaurants are about the same to me, but recently it seems that they are trying to find some way to set themselves apart. For me, what makes Fridays different is their ""Right Portion, Right Price"" menu items.  This is a selection of menu item that are smaller than their regular entrèes and priced accordingly. In my opinion, portion-size-inflation at American restaurants has gotten out of control and this menu is a welcome relief. The last time we were there, I had the Cedar Plank Salmon Pasta from the Right Portion menu, and my leftovers were still sufficient for a full lunch the next day - all for under $10 for the dish. It was quite well done as well (although too heavy on the butter/cream I think - anything tastes great under a heap of cream).  Imagine the size of a regular entrée! In addition to this, the service was excellent for this class of restaurant. The waitress was informative, attentive & thoughtful. The server was aware enough to ask if our 2-year old's plate (which was warm to the touch) should be given to him or to a parent instead.   I was pleasantly surprised.  I have to mention the green bean fries as well, which have got to be one of my favorite appetizers out there. (Can that count as my veggie serving?) If I was to criticize, I would have to point out the music was a little too overwhelming at times, especially with two kids two and under. Boy, I must be getting old to complain about the music volume...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
Unknown U.,"Westland, MI",247,7,,2.0,3/7/2011,"the new menu is pretty good, but the people who currently work there will ruin everything. the staff is pretty rude, they're all nice to u at the beginning when u walk in, it takes forever to order, they massed up an order almost every time I went there and it takes FOREVER to get a check every single time. honestly I'm pretty sure they're other people who would love to have their jobs",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40

Lexy B.,"Chicago, IL",12,25,,1.0,7/20/2008,"Tonight I ate at  TGIF Friday's or whatever the hell chain restaurant, they all blur together under the category of annoyingly large menus and restaurants that think that decoration means stapling garage sale junk to the walls. To let you know how annoying the atmosphere is of this place- they leave a credit card advert on your plates which allows you to save up points by eating the disgusting ""American style"" slop.   My food was late, not fresh and aesthetically gross!   The food was expensive too, especially for what it was. The topper of the meal was finding a hair in my sandwich- the waitstaff made me a new sandwich, but did not offer any type of discount.  I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but I feel like TGI Fridays is the worst one could possibly choose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
Siobhan M.,"Livonia, MI",1,12,,2.0,6/2/2011,"The food was only ok and the prices were far too high.  The atmosphere and wait staff  were nice but the food was overpriced, bland, and common.  I had fried macaroni and cheese based on a suggestion from a friend and I was not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
Stacey B.,"Oakland, CA",53,261,16,3.0,9/12/2007,"We were driving around looking for a place to have a late lunch.  I figured Friday's has a varied menu, they should have something vegetarian.  We stopped in and asked to check out the menu.  The hostess was surpised we wouldn't automatically know what was on it and politely inquired if we had ever been to Friday's.  We said a long time ago and said we were vegetarian and wanted to see if they had anything.  I could have sworn they had a veggie burger, but maybe I'm thinking of Ruby Tuesday's.  Well, they have a huge menu, but only one vegetarian thing.  It's not a veggie burger.  It's the portabella pasta.  The hostess checked to see if they had any veggie burgers hanging around and was very nice to us.  We decided to stay.  We each got the pasta, though they were willing to leave the meat out of something for us, and my BF got his without the parmesan cheese, since he's vegan.  It was pretty good.  Not the greatest quality, but it was fairly good.  I also got a banana milkshake, because I remembered from my teenage years that Friday's has great shakes.  Yup, pretty great.   Minus a star for only one veggie thing.  Come on, EVERY salad features meat?  As its main ingredient?  Aren't salads supposed to be about vegetables?  And it's not hard to have a box of veggie burgers in the freezer and whip one out now and then.  With a menu the size of a large book, I expect more than one thing veggie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canton?start=40
