Alex X.,"Chicago, IL",190,18,,4.0,10/19/2017,"I've been here at least 6 times now, but only ever for the endless apps deal. Regarding the endless apps: Food quality is good and consistent enough, and tastes exactly like how you expect a 10-15 dollar endless app deal to taste.  The wings are by far the best item on the endless appetizer menu and surprisingly high-quality. The jack daniels wings- my gosh I could eat those all day. Dumplings were tasty (and salty). Nachos were surprisingly good too. I've ordered the quesadilla a few times and it's always been soggy rather than crispy- still pretty good though. I thought the bbq flatbread was boring- but my friend enjoyed it. All the other menu items were okay as well- I've never been disappointed by anything except for the skillet meatballs and potato skins which I found bland. Service at this TGIF has been good- servers seem to be a bit over worked, and waits for refills can take a bit, but overall everyone here's been responsive and friendly. The only inconsistent thing has been the pricing-over the course of a year the prices have jumped between $10, $12, and $15. I wouldn't go back again at $15, but definitely will whenever there's a promotion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago
Nicola P.,"Chicago, IL",477,205,2070,2.0,7/13/2017,"Grabbed take-away here from ordering online and the food was alright. The fried shrimp were crispy but the fries were warm and a little lump. The side of broccoli was soft with a lemony taste that was a little too salty. The spinach was flavorful with garlic salt and tasted nice, but the portion size was laughable. I enjoyed the mozzarella/tomato salad, but there were too many red onions, which in turn, made the salad very bitter. I'm glad I didn't dine there BC the music was too loud and servers were rushing everywhere without saying excuse me. It was kind of depressing, to be honest.   Chicago being what it is with all it has to offer, I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago
Christina S.,"Chicago, IL",52,324,2434,4.0,5/14/2017,"Predictable and consistent food options. I enjoyed the Cajun shrimp and chicken alfredo over linguine.  Really generous and perfectly cooked chicken and shrimp.  The ""cajun"" spices add a kick that provides heat-so much so that it took me three meals to finish this dish.

Jean L.,"Chicago, IL",435,713,1138,2.0,1/11/2017,"I've never been to a TGIF until yesterday. Somehow I've managed to walk past the loud commercials, the loud signs screaming Americana cuisine...and somehow, a coupon for BOGO entree with two beverages was enough to entice me. Go figure. Anyhow, THE BAR: Certain specials are only available at the bar. Like everyone else complained on Yelp, the bar sucks. I waited there without so much as a glance up from the bartender that walked past me at least 3 times. I finally gave up and went back to the hostess stand to ask for a table. The service at the table: surprisingly good. Very pleasant and very accommodating. The food: Meh. I mean, it's OK, but for the price - the portions could have been bigger, and it is oddly reminiscent of frozen dinners. That all being said, with the BOGO coupon, the price is palatable. Without the coupon, I think I'd rather go to a ""nicer"" restaurant. PS: beer's cheap. Large pours for $5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago

Francis R.,"Chicago, IL",687,716,1012,3.0,1/7/2017,"TGI Fridays? I haven't heard that name in years... For reals though, I probably haven't been to one since the good ol' college days where we would take advantage of their happy hour and appetizer specials being the broke college kids we were. Anyways, a recent coupon in the mail was what sparked our interest in paying TGIF a visit. Free entree with the purchase of two drinks & another entree, why not? Maybe I haven't changed much over the years where I still can't pass up a good deal... Let's do this! So initially, we had walked in and opted to sit at the bar front hoping to get quicker service. But I should've known from all the empty glasses and left over food plates sitting on the bar that it would be awhile to get served. We sat there for just shy of 5 minutes before heading back to the hostess to grab a table and what a much better experience. Although we waited for another 5 minutes before our waitress came by with our menus, she apologized sincerely for the wait. Apology accepted. After carefully studying the menu and looking over their specials, we promptly put in our orders for their $5 special 22oz blue moon beers and our entrees, a cajun chicken & shrimp pasta & a grilled salmon caesar salad. Surprisingly the food wasn't bad at all, but then again I didn't have much expectation coming in. If you've ever had the southwestern chicken pasta from Cheesecake Factory, the flavors were almost identical for their cajun pasta. Portions could be a bit more as I did find myself still a bit hungry afterwards. All in all, not bad for just under $30 for 2 entrees and 2 beers (Reminder we had a coupon for a free entree). That's all I got on this one! 'Til next time, cheers! 7/365",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago

We noticed the night manager inappropriate behavior in plain view, which was a surprise & we both said something to each other with confused looks on our faces. It took a moment for our appetizer to come but when it did it was good EXCEPT for the avocado that looked old darkish color. Now when our dinner came that was a different story, didn't look presentable, my black bean w avocado burger had rubbery avocados, butt end tomatoes that were dried up, slimy lettuce and hard fries not fresh, I couldn't finish my food. Her salmon was slightly charred and dry, and her spinach was seasoned heavily in certain areas. His kiddie mac n cheese was bland and watery -but he loved his strawberry shake.

Always crowded with mostly families with kids and may even might need to wait. Not a place if you are looking for place to relax.  They serve big entres with fries and soup sides to choose from.

Adam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Short: They made my girlfriend wait outside after 11pm in the cold while I placed a to go order after they refused to seat us due to her not having an ID at the time (left at hotel), while simultaneously seating families with younger children (ranging from 5-15 years old) expressing that their policy disallowed patrons under age 21 (my girlfriend is well over that age) into their establishment late-night, but minors were allowed if accompanied by an adults.  Troubles did not stop here.. read on if desired: I frequent Chicago often and allow me to make the following clear, for anyone wondering: THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT, A CHICAGO FOODIE DESTINATION.  DO NOT THINK FOR A SINGLE SECOND THAT YOU WILL BE MET WITH ANY EXPERIENCE THAT REFLECTS THE PEOPLE/FOOD OF CHICAGO. Now that we have that settled, onto the actual review.. which I am really only taking the time to write as it is a direct safety concern in regards to their policies, but more importantly, the common sense of genuine morality and concern for others. Anyone who knows Chicago, and for those that don't, most places tend to close relatively early in the city.  Food options become pretty sparse, especially for a dine-in experience, once you get toward midnight as most kitchens are closed if the establishment is even open at all.  On this short trip to Chicago, after a very busy and tiring day, my girlfriend and I were starving and with little options late one evening we remembered that this particular location happened to be very close to our hotel, which was directly on the Magnificent Mile.  We walked over and once inside we were immediately met with rude employees, however, undeterred we asked for a table for two.  They asked for our IDs as protocol, which was no issue whatsoever, however because it was so late my girlfriend had not taken her wallet with her from the hotel, so as a result she had nothing to provide to them.  Though very well over age 21, we do both young, so I wasn't very bothered that we were basically turned away and we opted to retrieve her ID from the hotel and return. During our walk back we decided to hit a donut shop to bring some late night goodies back to the hotel for after our meal that we were aiming to return to, but then we had the brilliant idea of calling and ordering our meal to go from TGI Friday's seeing as the ONLY edible (and delicious, might I add) item we have ever eaten that is even remotely worth ordering off their menu is the Jack Daniel's Chicken.  I called and was told over the phone that to go orders can only be placed at the bar inside.. at this point we were pretty fed up with the fact that no matter what we would do they just didn't want us to eat their chicken, but now stubbornly determined we decided to go back over to the location, order in person for pick up, which we did.  As we approached the door we were denied entry due to her not having an ID, but thought nothing of it until they continued to deny her entry even though we were placing a to go order.  She was made to wait outside as I went to the bar to order and I was planning to step outside to keep my girlfriend comfortable in the cold while the food was being made.  After sitting at the bar it took over 10 minutes for one of the 3 servers walking around to finally approach me for my order.  I ordered two of the Jack Daniel's chicken strip appetizer and only after waiting for 15 minutes did the waiter express that he mis-inputted my order and that I was being made two Jack Daniels chicken breast entree instead - I express that was not what I ordered and the waiter said ""well, I already closed the order and the kitchen is already making it.""  I was pretty livid, but placidly said with a smile on my face, ""that's a shame then, you better tell the kitchen to start making what I ordered.."" he then sent me a manager who was actually very nice and helpful and remedied the situation without question/issue immediately.  I proceeded to now go outside where my girlfriend was waiting and was told that if I left the restaurant then my ordered would be immediately canceled in the kitchen, but I would be forced to pay and would not get my food.  Wtf? At this point I had had enough and sought out the manager who was helpful/kind.  I explained the situation and how much of a safety concern it was to force a paying patron to stand outside in the cold alone late at night, but most pressingly the fact that there were kids ranging from 5-15 years old sitting with their parents enjoying a (probably disgusting, unless it was the JDC) meal.  His mental/moral compass kicked in, but best he seemed to be able to do was let my girlfriend stand in the doorway and I was once again told that I need to sit at the bar to wait for my food or else my order would be cancelled without reimbursement. Food took forever to make.  Experience was awful.  Service is horrible.  Business ethics/policies need to seriously be reevaluated most pressingly for safety reasons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=60

Aja C.,"Kenwood, Chicago, IL",24,1,,1.0,8/13/2016,"I'm very concerned about the staff and service expectations at this location. From the moment of entry into the restaurant and being immediately asked for a photo ID, prior to even receiving a greeting was off putting. To which then the 'hostesses' debated about where to seat us, after pointing at us and saying 'wait over there'... Two other parties entered the restaurant and were greeted, but not initially asked to show IDs, I looked shocked at which point one of the hostesses asked for IDs, and proceeded to seat one of those parties before seating us... At that point I felt it necessary to speak with a manager... 'Q' finally comes and asks who needs a manager, I politely explain what had transpired since we entered the restaurant. She apologized and asked if we still wanted to dine and we said yes. She seated us herself and apologized again... A moment later the waiter Von'e approached the table welcomed us and asked about drinks. I asked a question about the drinks menu and she responded quite negatively with 'she doesn't know, she doesn't drink' so at that point we just ordered waters and our food. Our food comes, brought by another worker who was quite pleasant THANK YOU and even grabbed us utensils, that hadn't been provided by Von'e. So from the hostesses to the waiter no one seemed happy to be there let alone working with a 'happy to help' attitude. Their dispositions were quite unpleasant to be working in customer service.

Nelson M.,"Champaign, IL",246,817,1528,4.0,6/9/2013,"Restaurant Review Pick 2 for 10 enticed me to this location in downtown. With the slumping economy in these chain restaurants, they are offering bargain prices for meals not often seen. I was a bit skeptical at first, but what can you ask for 10 dollars. I left with a smile. It was not too busy on a weekend for lunch. They easily squeezed my wife, a child in a stroller, and me in a table. The waitress was super nice and took our orders quickly. I picked the fried mozerrela which was small planks of fried cheese with marinara sauce. No complaints here, there was more than 6 of these small patties and was the perfect appetizer to share. My wife got the chicken florentine flat bread which was cooked well and perfectly seasoned. My entree was the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta with slices of tomato, cheese, and chicken. The chicken was tender and not too overseasoned. There was a strong grill flavor to the chicken but it went well with the pasta.

Corey D.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,12/31/2016,"This is the second bad yelp review that I have ever given. It's warranted.  I ordered the Jack Daniel's Ribs & Shrimp for delivery via GrubHub. The ribs came; the shrip did not. I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager. In a rather dismissive voice, she told me to call GrubHub. Guess what? GrubHub sent you the correct order. You made the order, and you did it improperly. And even if we assume that GrubHub is to blame, as a matter of decent customer service, would it kill you to say ""I'm sorry that you received the wrong order?"" Evidently that would be asking for too much because no apology was issued. With that sort of attitude running the restaurant, it's easy to see why the order was messed up in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=20
Tanya T.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,6/27/2017,"The only reason I gave this Friday's location even 1 star is because, my husband and I FINALLY ate!!! First of all, they asked if we preferred to sit at the bar, or a table and we chose to sit at a table. I am an average size person (size 10) and could not fit in the booth space. The table was bolted to the wall and couldn't be moved. Neither could the seat. My breasts were literally sitting on top of the table! We asked if we could get a seat outside at the bistro setting and we were told it would be another 25 minute wait. About 5 minutes later, we saw customers who arrived after us being seated outside! I ended up sharing my husband's side of the booth. Secondly, we only had appetizers and drinks and it took the waiter 30 minutes to come back with the drinks. It took another 45 mins. to an hour for them to come back with food. After knowing we were done, no one came to give us a check for at least 15-20 minutes. The place was moderately crowed, which, I tried to come up with excuses for them. But, I've seen way busier places than that especially downtown.

I was very upset at the fact that I've paid about 10$ for a smoothie. And then when the check came I showed him my stripe points so I could claim my coupon he just wrote my rewards number. At this point, the waiter has swiped our card and we had paid full price. The Manager comes in to explain to me that the only way I can use it is if he charges us again and we'd have to wait days for the first charge to fall off.

Eric C.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2014,"Don't normally take the time to complain but this was the last straw. My coworkers and I have been going here just about every week for the past few months because it is steps away from work and the lunch special. We only have a 45 minute lunch break so the location is very convenient. Over time we got used to the slow service and just dealt with it and were usually late getting back because we could not be served and eat in 40 minutes apparently. We would mostly order soup and salad, rarely entrees because of time constraints, and always sat at or by the bar. This particular time it was taking more time than usual to get our food after we ordered a little bit before 12:30. Lunch break ends at 1:00. We started paying our bill around 12:55 because we were trying to save time after we ate and not have to worry about it. Some people got to pay, some people didn't because the bartender walked away. At 1:00 we had to tell the kitchen staff, the bartender wasn't at the bar, to please just box up our food to go because we're already late. This was 5 lunch special orders, mix of soups and salads and 1 chicken tenders. This is Friday's, I don't think the chefs were growing their own lettuce back there or making the soup of the day specially for individuals. The place was not busy at all. It appeared that there was about one employee per every two customers there. People that sat at the bar after us received their food before us. At 1:05, the bartender gave us 2 large bags with our to go food, apologized to us, and we left. We were shocked that the manager didn't apologize, we were not offered anything, and since we all had already paid to save time there was no discount. When we all got back to the office to pass out our food, of course the chicken tenders were missing and a salad was missing. I called the manager and explained the situation and he kept referring to our pick up order. No, this was dine in. He proceeded to tell me that he has my food ready for pick up.  He refused to send somebody over to drop it off after I asked. I had to leave work again to pick it up, no apology, nothing.

Tyler G.,"River Grove, IL",0,1,,5.0,5/1/2014,"My girlfriend and I were walking around the Water Tower Place and we were starving to get a bite to eat. Of course there are probably many well-known places to eat around the Water Tower, but we were craving for some Hamburgers and we both knew that T.G.I Fridays has the Jack Daniels Burger. As soon as we entered T.G.I Fridays the hostess greeted us and she showed us to our seats. As we were passing through the seats, I couldn't keep my eyes off the decoration around me. I saw a long canoe on the ceiling, which I was at awe for that it, was very big. One of the decorations that specially caught my eye was a medium size statue of the Blues Brothers, which I enjoy seeing their signature dance time to time. Like I said there are many things to look at on the walls and everything is nicely lighted and everything is clean. The restaurant gives a good relaxed vibe and with the great service that makes it worthwhile to eat here.  When we sat at our table, we were greeted with a waiter I probably wont ever forget. He looked like Ray Liotta with a personality of a modern Elvis. He starts off with saying his name and then he asked us what we wanted to drink, so we told him we want water. He was nice and patient as we were looked at all the delicious foods and forgot why we even came here.  After we were given a generous amount of time to look at the menu, we decided to get 2 burgers and 3 appetizers.   The three appetizers that we got were called Thai Pork Taco, AHI Tuna Nacho, and the Cornbeef and Swiss Slider. The Thai Pork Tacos look like any ordinary taco with pork, onions, cilantro, and the corn tortilla, but what made it different was the sweet Thai sauce on the taco. The taco was good and filled with pork, but I felt that it had too much cilantro in it. The next appetizer was the AHI Tuna Nacho, which had the strip of tuna on a nacho chip with avocado, Sriracha sauce, and wasabi mayonnaise. The chips were good especially with the tuna strips and the generous portion of avocado that can cancel out the Sriracha sauce and the wasabi mayonnaise if you want. Lastly from the appetizers were the Cornbeef and Swiss Slider that happen to be fairly packed with the cornbeef. The Swiss was melted on the cornbeef and had pickles and onions on it. Out of all the appetizers, my favorite was the CornBeef and Swiss Slider since it was the closest thing to my soon to come double-stacked burger.   The two burgers we got are called the Jack Daniel's Burger and the All-American Stacked Burger. I had the All-American Stacked Burger, while my girlfriend had the Jack Daniel's Burger. The All-American is a big burger that consists of lettuce, tomatoes, onion, bacon, thousand-island sauce, cheddar cheese, and two beef patties. The burger was tall enough that it needed a long toothpick to stabilize it. The burger itself was delicious with all kinds of juices from the thousand island and the patties itself was dripping down my hand. The Jack Daniels is personally on of my favorite burgers since it had the sweet-alcoholic hint from the Jack Daniels sauce. The sauce comes in a cup so you can pour as much as you desire on the burger or you can dip your fries in it. The Jack Daniels has bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, provolone cheese, and a meaty patty. The Jack Daniels sauce is what makes the burger, so I bet you can ask for some and not miss out on the burger itself. Over all T.G.I Fridays near the Water Tower gets a 5/5 for their great restaurant service devoted to the customers experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=140

The manager handled the situation okay, I guess, when I informed her, but didn't seem to care that scheme exists and certainly didn't have any plans to do anything about it.  So, remember, your stuff will probably be stolen unless you nail it to the ground.  If you're lucky enough, one of those trashy people may steal your wallet, then use your money to pay for White Castle and several South Side gas stations.  Awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=140

On my receipt it showed a ""rush"" order on my food.  That tells me that the server forgot to put it in at the time of the rest of the order.  It's a shame Friday's, we been faithful customers for years but we will definitely be taking our business elsewhere and letting others now how you've gone downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=100

The waiter was nice and started us off with water, gave us some time to look through the menu. Everything was going fine, we ordered some appetizers and drinks. Once our appetizers arrived though, that's  where it went down hill, they hadn't brought us any plates or silverware, were we expected to eat these appetizers with our hands or what? So we waited to see if maybe our waiter would pass by, nothing not even the other employees that were just walking around, yeah it was a bit busy but come on like 4 different employees passed by and didn't even look to see that we were annoyed, then we see everyone standing at the computer where the waiter/waitress puts in the order talking  and then my partner had to put his hand up to at least get one of their attentions, he even had to waive just to catch someone's eye until one of the ladies looked and at first she had on this look like we had bothered her by raising our hand, we wouldn't be raising our hand if at least our waiter or any employee was attentive to the guest which I'm sure is the priority right? So then she had the host come to our table to see what was wrong and told him we needed silverware and plates, he brought us the silverware still no plates, then we just decided to eat. The drinks also took a while to arrive I'm not sure if they only had one bartender that night or the drink took a while to make but we had to wait on them too. I also work in the restaurant business and having to have the guest waiting for something or not following up on their table is a big no-no for us. Other than that the food and drinks were good, it was just the service that kind of tanked, and yeah it was a bit busy but when you have 4 or 5 employees running or standing around talking and the guest having to raise their hand to get their attention makes you wonder if the guest is their first priority or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=100

Something about their ratio of lettuce to other stuff, plus the vinegarette dressing they use. Yum. I love 'em, okay? And I'm not afraid to admit it. I was in the area last night. Had margaritas with a few Super Elite Yelpers, and then went to a going away party for a former coworker. Let's just say I needed a little snack, mkay? And leave it at that.

But this . . . the inmates were apparently in charge. It was chaos, I tell you, utter chaos. I'm starting to be turned off. I think ""I'll just visit the bathroom quick, and then decide if I want to stay and maybe eat at the bar."" Enter bathroom. It's in disarray. Dirty, smelly and complete with . . . vomiting woman. Not me. Urrgh. Exit. The house itself smelled like a wet dog, and was packed, just packed. I get that this is kind of a lowbrow place, but it's also an informal place where parents can bring their children to dinner, and teach them things like manners, and the civilized art of dining in a restaurant. Except no such learning seemed to be taking place. Kid chaos everywhere. No restrictions whatsoever on the little darlings. The Restaurant as Amusement Park. Still wanting that Cobb salad, I think ""Retreat to the bar. There will be adults there."" I spy a barstool where I can have space on either side of me, and set out for that.

The plates then proceed to come out at different times from entree first to appetizer(dried up old potato skins) to my entree and then proceed to wait for the third entree which takes forever. At this point we cancel the third order, which our server could care less once more. I tell the rest of my party to head home because obviously at this point she was taking forever to bring my check. Never one apology! Ask who the manager is... She gives the name but per restaurant policy is not able to write it down, I need to walk outside the restaurant and write it down myself.

It was our first time to the city restaurant, and it was very disappointing. To come into the city and have subpar food and subpar service was very irritating. Now back to our food, his chicken was mostly burnt on the bottom, his shrimp was bland, it sat out too long in the window, the onions and green peppers were over cooked, mine was the same experience but without the shrimp. They have an obnoxious amount of servers, I mean I understand for it being a game day, but it is also before holiday and most people are going to be out of town.

Recently I dined in with my little sister as a going away to college lunch. Had a great time and great service. I had such great service i deceided to return a week later 8/25/14 with my roomate. It started with our waitress we were seated and that pretty much all we saw of her. We requested to have the unlimited appetizers 1st and becuase she for got to put the order in and we waited so long, she brings out 4 platters instead of 2 at one time of the appetizers. The table was cluttered and it she never came to remove any of our used plates and glasses, i had to flag down other waiters to assist my table. When she saw me speaking with other waiters she would YELL from across the room that she was coming to assist me. After I had already been helped. My water refills were all done by waiters I had to flag down. Also by the time the entree came, we were full off appetizers so we asked for a TO-GO box. instead she brings out more appetizers. Before I could say anything the waitress turns to me and says: ""You cant take those appetizers home, we will have to call the police if you try to leave with them and we have people watching!"" I was extremely offended!! 1st they are $10 appetizers and i'm sure the police isn't making arrests over something this petty as taking 3-4 potstickers home in our order. In my previous visit the week before, we had a few of our appetizers left and were able to take them home. My point to her was, if she would have brought them out ON TIME, instead of trying to DOUBLE UP and bring out TWICE as MANY at 1 time, we wouldnt have needed to take any home. So we left our TABLE w/4 platters of FRESH APPETIZERS LEFTOVER!!...It seemes like such a terrible waste.

I, personally, do not enjoy this particular restaurant; but I will attend maybe once every other year if a close friend insists. On February 25, 2016 (around 9pm), however, my father was extremely excited to spend his birthday evening here with his family. Worst birthday experience thus far. From the moment we stepped in the door , we were not impressed as the host just leaned on the wall barely greeting us. Then we had the privilege to sit at a booth next to a dirty table, that hadn't even attempted to be cleaned until my father spoke up on it 45 minutes into our dining time. Even then, it was only partially picked up with more to come its way later on. Unfortunately, for us there was only one waitress in our entire section and she wasn't particularly ecstatic about serving. To try and shorten what could go on for lengths, my father spoke with the manager about his dissatisfaction which continued with long waits for food, lack of service alertness, incorrect orders, unclean restrooms and dining area, and not so great meals. After being asked to be spoken with a second time, the manager never showed her face and did not even attempt to provide concern for such grievances. To top things off, my sister and I each had one of the chicken selections, and I can't help but to think that our aching stomachs are a result of the food.

We ended up splitting a rack of ribs and some fried green beans. OMG, the meat just fell off the bones! It was delicious. That alone warrants the four stars. The fried green beans were also good; I liked the slight horseradish taste.  I don't go to these chain restaurants very much, but the last and only other time I've been to TGIF (in California), I had a Jack Daniels burger. I thought it was pretty good (not the best though).  I'd say that TGIF and similar restaurants would usually get 3 stars from me, but because the meat fell off the bones at this particular restaurant, I'd give them 4 stars.

Ellen G.,"Chicago, IL",4,20,,5.0,4/21/2015,"I had the best steak ever here, and the spinach was amazing.  The steak rivaled any high end steak place in Chicago, which is saying something.  $11.90 for 6 oz sirloin and 2 sides.  The spinach has mushrooms and onions, which I've never had together before.  Perfect with the steak.  The jasmine rice was excellent.  The steak had no fat, cooked perfectly, juicy, thick.  They have 10 oz also.   I also had the bacon mac & cheese bites, which I would not get again.  I asked the waiter if the bacon was mixed in with the mac & cheese and he said it was, but that is not the case--he must have misunderstood the question.  They are fried mac & cheese balls with a piece of bacon on top.  4 to an order.  Not worth the calories.  OK to share with 2-4 people, but I was by myself.  Service was great, steak cooked to order.  If you're in the mood for a steak dinner in a casual atmosphere at a reasonable price, check out TGI Friday's in Streeterville!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=80

trina b.,"Chicago, IL",36,81,2,2.0,5/3/2008,"It would be two and a half stars, and I'm not being harder on it because it's a chain, I am treating it fairly and taking it for what it is. That being said, I have had many better meals at other similar type chains. I think it's fair to be able to compare chain to chain. I was floored that the menu didn't have very many options for vegetarians. Hello? It's not 1980 and we aren't in a little town in Texas. We are in a big city and it's 2008! Give at least two decent veggie meal options!! At most places, there is at least an option to sub in a veggie burger. It wasn't listed on the menu anywhere I could find, the only substitute they offered was for a turkey burger. I would have asked my server but he was pretty useless and made himself scarce most of the time. And only came to get our order when I was in the bathroom so my husband had to order for me. I will say that the food came out fast, but that wasn't our server, it was someone else!  We ordered the fried mac and cheese as an appetizer and I must say it was very yummy and it was a mystery to how the mac and cheese inside stayed soft and creamy and not all stuck together once fried. So points for that Friday's. In the past we have also tried the fried green beans and those are good too especially with the dipping sauce. But really anything fried is going taste great and kill you a little bit while you sit lickin' your lips. Expect it. And if you eat it, own it.  We both ordered off the as seen on the food network menu, my hubby got the steak sandwich with fried plantains and he loved it. I got (my only choice on the menu unless i wanted just a side salad and soup) some sort of lasana cold noodle salad on top of fried eggplant. Yes, I thought it sounded strange too but I thought, hey, it won on the food network so it can't be that bad! Ohhh, my. Silly silly me. BAD. Very bad. Cold super long noodles with little flavor that were hard to eat, and slicked up with so much oil they could slide down a slip and slide without water. Then drowning underneath all that were the fried eggplant that were supposed to be warm, but were not. The eggplant also had no flavor. All I have to say is, What a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad idea!! The service wasn't great either, when our server was around, he wasn't friendly and would only stay at our table for a millisecond. We couldn't even ask for our check because he was in and out so fast. (That's what she said!...for my Office friends)  Overall, not the worst, but next time if I want a chain, and I'm downtown, I'm heading over to Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=160

Matthew G.,"Chicago, IL",36,108,5,3.0,2/11/2009,"I have to admit it - I think TGI Fridays is fine.  Sure, it's a chain restaurant.  Yes, Chicago has excellent and far superior independent eateries, but this Fridays location (at least for me) serves a purpose. I work very nearby.  I don't go out for lunch during the work week all that often (maybe 4-5 times a month).  In the immediate area, there is a glut of crappy fast food and sandwich shops as well as many pricey, elegant places.  There is very little middle ground - places that offer a quick, hot meal for a decent price. For me at least, Fridays is that middle ground.  Sit at the bar, read the latest novel, have a hot lunch and then head back to work.  They have good salads, I am rather fond of the fish tacos, they have some well-balanced chicken dishes and every so often, I will have a flat-iron steak.  Are these dishes the most creative things I've ever eaten?  No, but they are fairly priced and consistent. Mind you, I always sit at the bar.  I have found the service to be perfectly efficient.  I never sit at a table, so I cannot comment on the regular servers.  The bartenders take my order and leave me to my book until I'm ready to pay.  They are friendly enough and refill my soda periodically, so I am getting exactly what want. They also have a lunch card (get 5 punches, get a free lunch - only at the bar, not at tables) as well as their ""stripes"" promotion which gives you other special offers that are generally pretty good. I would not make a special journey to Fridays.  I would not choose it for an after-work dinner and movie date, but it serves my lunch time well.  Fridays is a chain, but even chain restaurants have their useful places in the world.  I give this location a solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=160

Moses never explained the endless appetizer deal that wasn't on the menu when we asked about it. A friend at the table, who knew what the deal was, had to do his job and help the rest of us.  Once we ordered, Moses only gave us three plates for our appetizers and never brought us napkins the entire time and never brought the rest of our plates. Two of use had to eat using the appetizer dishes. Also he only came to remove appetizer dishes once. So we had to start putting our empty drink glasses, empty appetizer plates on an empty table as he would bring a few more items on the half hour. We didn't have any more room at the table. My friend's were never able to get a refill on their pop in the entire three hours. I do not eat pork and would get sick if I did. I mentioned that I didn't eat pork when I was ordering my appetizer so he could tell me which ones had pork. I came to enjoy a Jack Daniels burger with no bacon/onion, an appetizer, and a dessert. An hour after ordering, he shows up with a dbl cheese burger full of bacon and proceeds to argue that I ordered this bacon burger and tried to shove it in my face because he didn't want to admit he was wrong. Who does that? He took no responsibility, gave no apology, and his customer service skills were offensive.  I unfortunately, had to cancel my order because I didn't have another hour to wait for him to get it wrong again and our friend's valet time was expiring after dealing with this nonsense.  I spoke to manager, Johnny, who didn't introduce himself nor wear a nametag. We had to get his name from another employee. I informed him of how our service was not good and how I came to enjoy a JD burger and had a bacon burger shoved in my face and the server tell me it would be a ""long time"" before I get my correct order. The manager did not take responsibility nor ownership of his server's poor service, and gave no apology. All he said was, ""I don't think I can get your order out to you faster."" I canceled my order and didn't order anything else. I expect better from TGI Friday's, especially since the manager claimed the Erie St location as the flagship.  During our visit we also had to deal with gnats flying around. The ""loaded"" potato wedges were anything but and they looked and tasted like the restaurant ran out of the appropriate cheese and they substituted with an Aldi brand spray cheese.

Sharon C.,"Chicago, IL",426,382,29,3.0,7/15/2014,"I was here with a group of five other people for the unlimited appetizers deal, which is, obviously, an incredible amount of food for $10, especially because we shared all of our appetizers and got three rounds of each. In case you have less than six people, here are the things we got, in order of how much I liked them:  1. Loaded potato skins. Always the loaded potato skins, which I crave when I can't get, and which I have resorted to buying frozen from Costco in desperate times. These were crunchy, with generous amounts of cheese and an acceptable, if not as generous, sprinkling of fresh bacon. Definitely the favorite dish we got.  2. Bruschetta. One of the things we were on the fence about ordering, but it ended up being a fantastic choice (for those of us who liked tomatoes... so not me). It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty, and really refreshing, especially against the other, heavier things we ordered.  3. Mozzarella sticks. Arrived at the table at the perfect temperature - almost nothing more disgusting than lukewarm mozzarella sticks - and the perfect proportions of coating to cheese.  4. Boneless buffalo wings. I'm not a fan of boneless buffalo wings in general, but these were particularly one-dimensional and featured a very, very thick coating of batter with a small piece of meat.  5. Potstickers. Generic, definitely not something we would have ordered if we had had fewer people. The sauce was the only part of this appetizer that was interesting or different. Would not recommend.  6. Spinach dip. Definitely not worth ordering, it's a huge portion of spinach dip paired with a small serving of chips. The dip was bland and insufficiently creamy, with a weird, buttery aftertaste. Would not recommend.  We also ordered a short glass of Angry Orchard and one of 312, both on tap. Our waitress initially brought us two glasses of Angry Orchard, but she was quick to correct her mistake once we pointed it out.  Service overall, however, was lacking. I understand that, since the bill was so small, she wasn't anticipating much of a tip, but she dropped by our table to check on us only once, mumbling something that only one person heard, and we  only saw her three times more - twice when she asked if we wanted more food (yes), and once when we asked her for the check. Our food was brought out by other people, and she never actually brought us our check. At least ten minutes after we asked, another girl saw us waiting, asked if we needed our check, and brought it to us within minutes.  I'm going to give this experience three stars because service was pretty much nonexistent and because of the wait times, which were far too long considering there weren't that many people in the restaurant. This deal, however, is definitely worth going in for - and it ends August 24!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=40

C H.,"Chicago, IL",40,72,243,1.0,12/13/2011,"Absolutely terrible: -Service: we came in during the early afternoon on a weekday and before we even had 5 seconds to look at the menu the waitress asked us what we wanted after we gave our drink orders. I told her I wanted 'a chance to look at the menu' and she huffs off. She continued to try to 'push' us through our dining even though the restaurant was mostly empty. And even in terms of trying to get people to eat reasonably (I've waited on tables before), she was pretty damned rude and disinterested. Its not like we looked homeless or were rude to her. -Food: the food was horrible except for the cheesecake (which was good). Now I didn't have too high expectations to begin with but the wasabi green beans were inedible/sour and probably friend hours beforehand  so that they were limp at this location, and then I had them 2 weeks later at another location and they were AMAZING. I ordered a grilled salmon entree and it was COMPLETELY INEDIBLE and fruit flies were actually buzzing around it. I was almost sick just smelling how fishy it was. The waitress noticed I wasn't eating it and didn't ask why I hadn't touched my food. She just took it away after my dining partner finished his food, and kept trying to push us as quickly as possible through our meal. You could tell she knew the food was gross but didn't want to comp us outright or something.  After dessert (the only half-way passable food we had even in terms of fast food), she asked if we wanted a check, at no point asking how our food was despite me not really even being able to eat the entree or appetizer, and I mentioned that the salmon had been inedible (nicely). She grudgingly comped the salmon without an apology or seeming to care, but overall the meal was not only unenjoyable, but unpleasant and a waste of money.  I had all the same food items at a different location, as I mentioned, 2 weeks later and they were all amazing and the service was great (at the other location).

One of my chicken breasts was undercooked and tasted like a rubber ball. The broccoli was not steamed at all. In fact, I believe they dipped it in hot water for 30 seconds to give the allusion that they were steamed. The only things that were OK on my plate were the mashed potatoes and one chicken breast... I was so disappointed.  Not to mention the waitress and her assistant (a new hire) completely forgot about me. Funny thing is, the seasoned server didn't ask me if I wanted a refill or if anything was ok at all, but strolled by my table about an hour after I received my food and said ""Sweety, I just wanted to let you know I didn't forget about you.""

The menu is not vegetarian friendly, but I don't know any vegetarians that are dying to go to Fridays.  I have had almost everything on this menu and yes I know they change it like quarterly.  SHUTUP.  23oz brew daddies can make anything taste good.  But seriously, it is great food here.  The only thing that I don't like (which was surprising) was the chicken tenders meal.  I had it once at the Miami F-Days on US-1 next to THE U and it was dry and unappealing.  Other than that the menu is your oyster. This place is consistently better than Chili's, Applebees, Outback, O'Charleys, and other all encompassing American Chain Restaurants.  If you like wings, though, Buffalo Wild Wings is definitely the better mainstream option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180
Karl P.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,3/16/2009,"OK... It's TGI Friday's, right? Standard, normal, no surprises chain food--pretty much know what you're gonna get. You would also think because the economy is in the shitter they would have great lunch specials during the week for the people that still have jobs downtown...  Nope. Biggest rip-off.  For $8.19 I got 2 mini cheeseburger sliders and a quarter cup of fries. It was less food than a child's meal any place else. Also for kicks they charge $5.17or a Miller Lite bottle... A MILLER LITE BOTTLE! Really? That's crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180
Michael O.,"Buffalo, NY",14,15,,2.0,9/1/2010,"I like predictable chain food as much as the next guy, but only when the service is up to par.  We've ordered take-out from this location countless times and always enjoyed our food.  In fact, the only problems I've ever encountered here occurred during our dine-in experiences.  Unfortunately, we've never once eaten in the restaurant and had a problem-free meal. A group of four of us sat down during a moderately busy Friday around 4:00pm.  The server took our orders promptly and brought our drinks almost immediately.  That was the end of our enjoyment.  Our food took 40 minutes to arrive, our appetizer arrived AFTER the meals, and one of our hot entrees was cool to the touch.  Sending it back to be warmed only exacerbated the problem, as the kitchen supposedly threw out the old one and ""forgot"" to make a new one.  After all of that, the server said they could neither award us Fridays Gold points nor accept our free appetizer because their system was down.  Not his fault, but still disappointing.  I know splitting a single check is a pain, so we put two credit cards down with $30 cash.  ""Take the cash off, then split the rest 50/50, please.""  He said no problem.  20 minutes later we ask where our check is -- he says he misplaced it and is looking for it.  What?!  We ask for the manager, who finds our check and says that the meal is on the house.  Imagine my surprise 4 days later when 50% of the meal shows up on my credit card!  Furious, it took me 2 days and 3 phone calls to get the charge credited back. Trying to fix a dinner service nightmare only works if you actually fix it.  I'll never dine in the restaurant again.  Their take-out service, though, will keep my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180
Mike S.,"Chicago, IL",33,32,4,4.0,6/27/2010,"On many visits, found the service to be exceptional and the food was very good as well.  It's right off Michigan Ave, so the neighborhood is decent. Outdoor seating is relaxing (a view of the Mile) but there's a slight garbage odor coming from the alley across the street.  Also, since it's down the street from the hospital, it's in the ambulance path - we had about 7 go by (with siren's on) during dinner...so that's a litte distracting.  And, although the service is great, the kitchen is very slow.  One of our entree's came out about 25 minutes after the other (they said the kitchen sent it to another table).  However, the manager comped one of our meals so that made up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180

Yvette W.,"Chicago, IL",44,267,47,4.0,10/1/2007,"I went here for the first time about 4 years ago at this location. The baby back ribs were great, but I didn't like the onion rings. They tasted nasty. I recently visited again last week and had the ribs. They were just as yummy, but they came with overly salted fries and something called ""onion strings"", which looked like onion ring scraps. They were better than the fries, though. I had a dessert which was a peanut butter chocolate chip pudding like thing which came served in a shot glass.

shaina v.,"Chicago, IL",18,106,3,1.0,6/10/2008,"We walked in here because the lure of the air conditioning was strong. We sat down. Looked at the menu. Were immediately reminded that the prices weren't cheaper than the other restaurants in the area. The music was really bad and loud and I asked the waitress if it could be turned down. She said it was at its lowest setting. Look lady, I've seen a volume dial before. Just tell me that your corporation mandates extremely loud soft rock at the lunch hour.

Stefan Fisher P.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,2/8/2013,"The treatment I received in this restaurant  recently was so horrible and insulting, I will NEVER step foot in a TGI Fridays again!! My brother and I were in the restaurant on Erie on February 1st when we were assaulted by a woman and her female companion.  One of the ladies threw a drink on my brother while the other pulled a knife on me.  We didn't know either of these women and had not ever spoken to them before.  I notified security who refused to intervene because he said he didn't see the knife.   I asked him to call the police and he refused.  I then spoke with the 2 managers on duty and they started badgering me about whether or not I was going to pay the bill.  REALLY!!! Then they called the police who came in asking me whether or not I was going to pay my bill.  What about the water and the knife!!!  I filed a complaint on the website and received a call back from a man in guest relations who stated they don't have any control over the contracted security they hire.  They also claimed that the incident occurred between 2 patrons so their policy is to just ask both of them to leave.  So your policy is if someone comes into your place of business, gets harassed, and assaulted, oh well, both of you get the hell out.  That's BULLSHIT!  I'm telling everyone I know to never go there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chicago?start=180

Mmm, chicken was super moist and the fries were delish. My friend and I also ordered the Mango Mai Tai's. The Mai Tai's were good but for the price I would have thought I would have caught even a little bit of a buzz. Service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was clean.
