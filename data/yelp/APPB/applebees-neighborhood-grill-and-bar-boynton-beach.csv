Joel L.,"Delray Beach, FL",111,60,,5.0,1/8/2018,"OK, We lost the Applebee's close to home in Delray Beach however, had a 'hankering' for those Sriracha Shrimp and their Spinach Artichoke Dip. My wife's favorite dish has always been the Bourbon Street Steak. She was not disappointed as it was cooked to perfection.  We always know to order her steak rare as the steak will continue to cook on the sizzling hot skillet.  This dish is extremely flavorful and filling too.  I ordered their well prepared and tender fall off the bone Double Glazed Baby Back Pork Ribs.....this was a real treat !  Considering the restaurant was extremely busy we received our apps cooked to perfection in record time.   Make sure if you order any appetizers that you finish those first before ordering your dinners.  The kitchen was that efficient and ran like a well oiled machine so, you'll want to pace yourself.  Your food will come out hot and fresh all the time.....       I do not know why other reviewers discredit this restaurant as we've NEVER had a problem and have always enjoyed our evenings here.   The wait staff was absolutely fantastic too.  Whomever the manager is running this establishment, knows his business and I commend him on running a great chain restaurant that was incredibly clean too.   We will be headed back here again very soon cause,  we used to eat at the one that closed down near us at least twice a week !  Yeah,....this place is one of our faves ~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach

Natalie S.,"Lake Worth, FL",77,5,,1.0,12/30/2017,We have been coming here as regulars for many years.  That all ended tonight.  Customer service has totally gone by the wayside.  We always ask for a booth.  Tonight they told us no booths were available except when we were seated right next to us was an empty booth.  We asked if we could sit at it.  We were told no they have no server for it.  So we sat at the table.  Except not even two minutes later they sat another couple at that booth & it was the same server we had.  The manager was not even apologetic.  He said it was a language barrier except the girl who sat us totally understood.  Needless to say we will not be eating here anymore.  I guess regular business means nothing to this manager.  I suggest eat at any of the other many restaurants in Boynton Beach.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Jake A.,"Herndon, VA",43,37,13,3.0,12/26/2017,"Went here to check out the $1 long island iced teas. They are pretty watered down/ not strong for the most part, but it's only $1.

I've never had a bad experience here. NEVER. The management is amazing. Chris especially.

Kevin R.,"Greenacres, FL",0,6,1,1.0,10/29/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went in for the $1 margarita. Sat down and ordered drinks, how convenient they were out of tequila for the margarita mix. So seeing if they would compensate for something else and they did not, the management and waiter looked at me like I had a margarita on my forehead. Service sucked. My wife's chicken was literally rubbery and bad. Manager called me a couple days later, telling me how he'd be sending out a few complimentary gift cards to my house. Here we are a month later and I still haven't received a thing. That place is a joke, and he can take those gift cards and give them to a homeless guy, because they would appreciate it more then I would at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Sandy A.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,12/3/2017,"We attempted to have dinner last night at Applebees in Boynton Beach. When we arrived at 6:00 pm. We saw many empty booths as well as people waiting around the front door and seated in the lobby. Upon questioning the front door hostess, we were advised that the wait for service would be 45 minutes to one hour. We inquired about all the empty seats and she just shrugged. I asked to speak to the manager who informed us that he was short help. Short on a cook, waiter staff and kitchen assistance. This was on a Saturday evening. Poor management! We left as did several other customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Scott F.,"Greenacres, FL",19,29,8,4.0,3/12/2017,"Enjoyed the wood fired bone in pork chop with steamed broccoli and garlicky green beans. The pork chop had perfect grill marks, was incredibly juicy and probably about 8 ounces in total. A bit salty but not a deal breaker. Broccoli was well steamed and had salt already on it. The green beans were gross with a greasy coating of garlic butter on them that shouldn't be there. Ever. Restaurant looks a bit tacky, as you'd expect from apple bees but a great family friendly place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Steve S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,33,1,1.0,1/12/2017,"Not sure what has happened to this location.   Last two times we have been there food has come out slow, wrong sides, some in our party dine eating before others get their food.   I guess it is the kitchen. A shame as we enjoy our Thursday night gatherings. Usually 7-10 of us. So  If they do not fix this it will be so much worse ""in season"".    So we returned in Jan.  8 people half empty restaurant... and exactly the same thing. Two meals forgotten, oh it will be right out...Goodbye.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Earl R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",215,22,4,2.0,5/17/2017,"Went to Applebee's in the early afternoon when they were not busy. Waitress was friendly and service was fast. We enjoyed the drinks and thought the selection and prices were reasonable. The entertainment consisted of an older gentleman sitting at the table singing along to music tracks. Would have been great except he was off tune quite a bit, but that was ok. What wasn't was the food. I ordered the select 12oz sirloin steak, mashed potatoes, and upgraded for fire-grilled veggies ($1.50 more). The Steak was so tough I could barely cut it using the steak knife. I had to cut the little pieces in half so I could chew through them. The mashed potatoes were cold and the veggies I paid extra for consisted of 2 pieces of squash, 2 little chunks of roasted pepper and some other veggies. I was going to go to Denny's but decided to upgrade, unfortunately Denny's would have been the upgrade.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach

Chad L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,5.0,2/4/2017,"My girlfriend and I sat down for dinner on Saturday the 4th and had excellent, friendly, happy, efficient service from Christina. We didn't end up staying because my girlfriend is crazy and changed her mind about where she wanted to eat after we already ordered appetizers, even though it was completely our fault as to why we didn't stay they told us don't worry about the drinks or food. On our way out Chris the manager followed us to make sure everything was okay and I just think that was super cool and really think they should get some love for the hospitality and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach
Robert M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,1/12/2017,Lousy service. Came here a lot in the past with no big complaints. Must have changed hands. Terrible service and when the manager stopped to ask about our dinners we told him we didn't order yet because our server disappeared he sorta of shrugged. We asked for our check and our server showed up with an attitude we paid our check and left.

Holly N.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,20,6,1.0,5/15/2016,"FOOD POISONING from (2) Shrimp Sriracha apps with a glass of wine - in a dirty carafe and  a dirty glass to pour it in to on Thurs 4/7/16- burning stomach at 1:30 am w/vomiting and diarrhea- couldn't get out of bed.  Missed a work day on Friday 4/8/16. I Called cust service about the shrimp app on Sat.4/9/16 left a message - THEY NEVER RETURNED MY CALL - I followed up with an email of my experience - never received an email back yet!  I never contacted the actual restaurant, why would I?  They didn't care when I was there and never ""fixed"" the problem!!  I would go here 1 time a week (conveniently located next to BJ's), they have ALWAYS had Dirty/greasy/dried food/lipstick wine glasses & carafes - dirty/greasy utensils - Most times I'd tell the staff to PLEASE replace w/clean wine glass-sometimes I'd watch the bartender take a towel to my dirty wine glass and watch her try to clean it- usually just rearranged the grease..One time bald manager (after 2nd time I sent glass back), washed it himself and the glass was returned to me by the waiter still dripping wet - stating ""the MANAGER cleaned this HIMSELF!""  -WOW!!  How cool is THAT????  How about just having clean glasses on hand???  What a concept!!!!!  (ask Nicole G about my dirty wine glasses I sent back on 2/3/16 - ask Doug L about dirty glasses/silverware and again on 2/23 AND again on 4/7/16 !!  ) ask Eva (I believe she's gone now? - she was great and actually cared), ask Jeremy D about dirty glasses/silverware on 3/17 & AGAIN on 3/30) , ask Daniel A, about the dirty wine glasses/silverware grease on 3/2/16, etc....I'm NOT making this up...ask them about it!   There is an OBVIOUS not caring from the top down - from corporate to the individual Manager's - so that explains why nothing has been fixed. I have lots of choices to eat out every night and Applebee's in Boynton or any town for that matter, won't be on that list anymore.  On the plus side, staff was always nice from the hostesses to the waiters but after the Food Poisoning experience and not ONE response from customer service, (if they acknowledge it, they have to do something about it, and it's been over a month, that shows how deep a problem they have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boynton-beach

Our shared appetizer was the buffalo wings (which they gladly changed to BBQ wings)  I had the fiesta lime chicken entree with the rice and he had the three cheese penne. Was not necessarily impressed with either but a good option if none other available.  The Happy Hour Drink Specials sound great. All Day, Everyday!

Apparently I was mistaken this location is essentially the land of the dead the average age of the locals is about 77 leading to a concert merely dead atmosphere..almost like heavens waiting room. Barring that the drinks were good well poured no shortage of alcohol.. The food took forever and I mean forever when it came out with my all day brunch burger ..it was terrible an over cooked egg on a sloppy totally ugly burger that looked like my 8year old made if he was asleep the wonton tacos were ok the Mac and cheese terrible and the grilled cheese like it was taken out of the freezer.  Needles to say I was very disappointed with this visit and especially this location.

I had to ask for my sons order to be ""complete"" (they first messed up the carrots, we asked for steamed carrots and they sent it raw, then his lemonade never came, I had to track down the server so we could get the dang lemonade).
