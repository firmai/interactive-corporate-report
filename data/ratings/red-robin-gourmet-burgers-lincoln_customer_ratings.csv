104,J T.,"Lincoln, CA",0,31,3.0,2.0,2012-05-05,"Not too satisfied with this locaction. When they first opened, it was always an enjoyable experience. Now, not so much. The service is the sore thumb. I have a hard time pinning this on the staff so I hold management responsible for this. Things seem to be inefficient at all hours of the day.  Everyone is polite. They just seem to not check in with you or get you what you need (like extra fries are hit and miss) . It seems the individual servers are always overwhelmed or get stuck working on tedious and time consuming tasks while my food is standing on the counter getting cold. This is especially true of tables served directly by the bartender who is responsible for making all the drinks in the place (obviously) . This leaves less time for his/her tables. The only reason this isn't 1 star is BC when I do get my food before it's cold and I get everything I asked for (I just wanted an extra basket of fries), it's good stuff. However, getting ""all "" of that has proven to be a challenge so I'm thinking I need to drop this place, or just this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=100,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472

We have had other instances of frozen burgers being served, wrong orders delivered, etc.  It's becoming harder and harder to come back given the other choices in the area.

My high point here are the servers.  They are always timely, attentive, and friendly.  At least there is a high point to discuss in this review.  Because it won't be the food, pricing, or decor.  If you're in a hurry or just aren't very picky about your burgers then Red Robin is a safe bet.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=100,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

I've been to this place more than a handful of times over the past couple of years because this one seems to be less busy than the Red Robin in Roseville. My drinks are never refilled, it takes over ten minutes just to get a basket of fries and ranch after ordering, my burgers occasionally come out cold, and they have even brought out my order wrong more than once. I should also mention that whenever I'm there, they're never all that busy. After about my tenth visit, I refuse to return to this Red Robin for their lack of service.

140,Sacto N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,37,,2.0,2013-01-30,"The food here is okay.  However, there are a few problems.  1. The service was way too slow.  It took at least 15 minutes to get our drinks. Our server said the bar was backed up, but it was a slow Tuesday night. It also took probably another 15 minutes to get more fries, twice.  I could have picked up fries at McDonalds and drove back in less time.   2. The service was poor.  The hostess was chatting with another worker. As we walked in she asked ""How many?"" then noticed that she had been ignoring this woman who had been standing there and came in before us.  Awkward moment.  When the waiter told us the bar was backed up, he disappeared, and didn't offer or just bring water over.  We got the water with the drinks.  When my friend asked for more fries again, the waiter came back about 10 minutes later and asked if anyone had gotten the fries for him.  They hadn't.      3. They have a $5 margarita that is about 8oz.  Maybe 10oz at most?  I've never seen a margarita that small.  Most places serve at least a 12oz to 16oz margarita for $5-$7, and this was supposed to be part of their 'happy hour' specials.  It was in a small cocktail glass.  The margarita was blended, and someone dropped it off without a straw, which the waiter saw and corrected.  I asked him if they had made a mistake on the size of the margarita.  He said that's the normal size.   I can't say I'd suggest this place until the service improves.  They also need to either make bigger margaritas or charge less for them.  The food was fine, good fries, decent burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=120,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.504,2.64

95,Jim A.,"Lincoln, CA",80,2,2.0,2.0,2013-05-25,"We went to Red Robin yesterday (Friday) at about 5:30PM. The place was about half full. We were greeted by someone at the desk who was about to seat another group, so he asked one of the other front desk staff to seat my group which consisted of me, my wife and our daughter.  He initially checked on one side of the restaurant and there was not a booth available, so we went to the other side. He was about to seat us at a table, but I saw that there were about 7 booths available on that side. When I asked if we could sit in one of the booth's he got an annoyed look on his face, but took us to one of the booth's. At no point after I asked to sit in one of the booth's did he say one more word to us.  He left us there and after about 15 minutes, and watching people who came in after us, a female server came to get our drinks and let us know that she was helping our server who had not yet come to our table. She was friendly and took our drink and appetizer order, which came and were finished before our server made it to our table to take our meal orders. He said very little when he did make it to our table and did not offer any apologies for not taking care of us in a timely manner. The food, when it finally arrived, was good. Our water was refilled once and then we were left with empty water glasses.  One other note. They had a huge sign inside the restaurant about honoring veterans. I am a veteran and had my Navy ball cap on and had asked if Red Robin had a military discount. They do not have a military discount and, based on my experience last night, they do not honor vets. The discount is not a big deal. Acting professional is. Especially in a service industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.3120000000000003,2.72

The buns on all of our burgers were cold and squishy. When we asked for new fries, they threw the old fries back in the fryer and tried to pass them off as fresh.

It took at least over 10 minutes to bring our drinks out. mistake 3. it took over 30 minutes to bring out our appetizer.

They never cleared off any dishes so we had a table with a very active baby that was trying to touch everything at the table and it was just about impossible to keep him from the dishes that can break or drinks that can be tipped over.

We know what to expect and this was FAR from it. We sat there for about 15 minutes. We saw one waitress and one waiter in our area but they were going to other tables and ignoring us. The hostess came to the bar area and we asked when we were going to get drinks and she pointed to the male waiter and said he would be over in just a minute. After another 5 minutes the bartender came over and took our drink and food order and apologised to us. We obviously were not her responsibility since she was the only one trending the bar. Either this place is way sorry staffed or the wait staff just doesn't care. We will stick with the elk grove location and never go to this one again.

70,Eric M.,"Lincoln, CA",57,32,2.0,1.0,2015-05-02,"Today was our youngest son's 4th birthday, so we took him to the Red Robin here in town to celebrate.  This has become a birthday tradition as you get a free meal on your birthday and it is a fun place to celebrate, especially for kids.  Our kids look forward to this birthday treat, and rightly so, our birthday boy was excited to go.  He talked about it all day.  Upon arriving he proudly announced to the server, as did my husband and I, that today was his birthday and that he was 4 years old.  He beamed with excitement. The server smiled and said that she would be sure to sing to him.  He was beyond thrilled to hear that.  After everyone was done eating dinner the server plopped down an ice cream sundae without saying a word and walked away.  My husband and I exchanged looks.  She returned a few minutes later and said ""Happy Birthday, little guy"" as she cleared some plates and walked away.  That was it.  Our son just sat there looking at his sundae.  I could tell that he was crushed.  We started singing to him, but just as we started a group of servers congregated at the table directly NEXT to ours as there were two birthdays being celebrated there.  The servers started singing 'Happy Birthday' to them.  Our son turned around in his chair and watched this take place.  When they were done singing the group of servers left and our son sat down in his chair and pushed his ice cream sundae away with tears in his eyes.  I was speechless.  Before I could even say anything to our son the servers returned to sing to that same table for a SECOND time because one of the persons celebrating their birthday had been in the bathroom when they sang the first time.  As they walked away -AGAIN- my son climbed into my lap and started to cry, saying, ""why didn't they sing for me? I ate my whole dinner and I was a good listener.""  I was crushed.  How do you explain to a 4 year old little boy that the server was possibly having an off night or whatever the reason was for her to be so thoughtless.  I worked in the restaurant industry as a server while in high school and college.  I get that it is a hard and an often times thankless job, but regardless I find tonight hard to excuse.  I talked to the manager on our way out and I honestly felt like he wanted to start laughing at my complaint.  I don't think you have to be a parent to know the importance of a birthday to a child.  My wife and I like to support local businesses here in town, but we will not go to Red Robin again.  This is not the first time we have had horrible service there.  We have been back several times since, hoping it would get better but tonight was a deciding factor for us.

The Best thing about RR is the Royalty Rewards and it is a nice treat to know you always get a Free Birthday burger on your Birthday month.  I think by now, I have used them the last 4 years and gotten at least 4 Free Birthday burgers, but this is the first time I can remember getting a Free 10th item! We got service by Victoria, she was very nice, helpful, and checked on us.  I highly recommend trying the Orange cream soda because as someone who rarely drinks soda, this was delicious and perfectly fizzy!!!!  It is everything I imagine a 1950's style soda shop would serve.  The flavor was awesome because I really love Orange creamsicles ice cream pops since I was a kid and that is exactly what the soda flavor reminded me of. I highly recommend trying the burgers, you definitely can't go wrong and there are sooo many choices to choose from!  Plus, enjoying bottomless french fries is pretty cool, which are cut like thick steak fries!  The most I've ever been able to eat is two servings, but the second refill always taste better because it is usually piping hot fresh.  We were asked a couple times if we wanted more fries, but two servings is always enough!   I like all their dipping sauces too, very tasty and even if I have to pay extra 50 cents or whatever, I really do not mind at all.  Every table has their Signature Blend seasoning, which is good and they also sell them, if you want to buy one to take home!  I like the new S & P grinders, those are actually very nice to have available compared to a regular Salt & Pepper shakers. I have tried a lot of their menu items over the years.  I definitely like RR waaay more than Chili's or Applebees, so this would always be my first preference.  The menu has good options and a variety of different choices, prices are very reasonable.   I love the French Onion soup,  I always order it!  They have great appetizers, I haven't tried much of the desserts though.  Their Strawberry Freckled Lemonade is AMAZING, I really like the Purple Popping drink too.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour if you want to order alcohol cocktail drinks or beers. The Southwest Chicken salad is one of my favorite things to order!!!  It's super good and Healthy.   I recently tried the Avo Cobb O salad and that was pretty good too, it's a big size and worth the $10.99 for all the toppings you get!  It comes with focaccia bread and that was yummy!  I feel like since the menu changed, and some RR restaurants got remodeled, it's just gotten so much better!  It's a nice family place too, you can bring your kids or grand parents or have large groups/small groups!  There is something for everyone to enjoy dining together. I am glad I had a good lunch experience here.  Thank you Victoria and Red Robin staff in Lincoln, CA.  The location was easy to find, tons of parking, and it's in a very nice area with other businesses, very close to Lowe's.   They also have cool bicycle parking here, you can ride your bike and have a decent place to lock it up at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.9640000000000002,2.0

I've even emailed the corporate office a copy of online complaints from a local Facebook group from many...many...many...unhappy locals.  It's truly disappointing Red Robin doesn't care about this location. The service is just mediocre.  My last visit was this past Sunday for a friend's birthday and the air conditioning wasn't working AND they didn't have hardboiled eggs.  But did offer to substitute them for cucumbers. Really? I wanted eggs for protein, not cucumbers.  I believe this location has a lackluster management and too relaxed of an employee-management atmosphere.  On another visit I witneased the manager on duty drinking a soda back in the area where employees get customer beverages,  food, etc.  This is a no-no!  On another visit,  the same manager is casually chatting with an employee as we walked in the door. Instead of promptly walking to the front and greeting us, he continued to chit-chat while we waited.  :( Lastly waiting for bottomless fries takes forever and when I ask for a well done burger, on more than one occasion, it comes out pink. Servers are always more than willing to take back the burger and are very apologetic, but they just need to step up their game and get things done right the first time.

This used to be a fun place to go with the family, but now it's just annoying with those money sucking, distracting tablets on the table. Not to mention it takes up room. Service is subpar and quality of food is where Red Robin really fails! My kids used to love coming here for the burgers and I was happy they had good salads. The last time we came here, my son ordered a cheeseburger and the meat and cheese looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 30 min or so. His fries were cold too. Oh, And I wonder if they don't do the ""bottomless fries"" anymore because we never got any before our meal and were never asked if we wanted more.  My BBQ chicken salad was awful! Lacked flavor and lettuce was disgusting. Chunks of iceberg lettuce that was all brown and the ""mixed greens"" were brown too. The quality of what was served was definitely not worth $11 for a salad at all!! I've had prepackaged salad from the store that was much fresher and tastier.  I'm really disappointed at this chain. It is not like it used to be. I would really like to see them get rid of those tablets, I think they're annoying and a waste of space. If people really want to play games, I'm sure they will use their phones/iPad/tablet in which they already pay for. Or maybe, they will have conversations with each other like the old days. Also, if the restaurant is dying down a bit after the dinner rush, please train your servers to be aware of their surroundings. No one wants to hear or be around immature behavior.

The small wait at the front door didn't intimidate us, knowing that the bar area is open seating (21 and over at all times,)we decided to high tail it over there and easily found open tables & booths. Red Robin has changed over the years. It got away from its Red diner look and has gone into a more modern look.

Lol Logan greeted us right away. He was energetic, knowledgeable, and when we ordered appetizers, he showed us how to do it on the table device. So smart! We only waited a short period of time for my wedge salad. It looked perfect! My friend ordered chili cheese fries. Since it needed to have melted cheese, it took a few minutes longer. We paid on the little device on the table. It's much faster, easier, and more convenient for the servers on a busy night. It allows you to split your check, leave a top, and do a small survey....

I have been to both many times but I prefer this one in Lincoln. It's got a nice parking lot where finding a space has never been an issue. The location is clean and well-taken care of. The employees are always friendly. Whenever we come here, we try to get a booth inside the bar area. You don't have to wait for a table with the hostess. Just walk into the bar and see if there are any seats available. This is perfect for catching a game while enjoying some awesome food and drink. I've had the pleasure of having Noe take care of my wife and I whenever we sit at the bar. He is always friendly, enthusiastic about his work, and efficient. He always comes back to check on us to see if we need a refill on beverages or fries. It's almost like he knows when our glasses or basket of fries are nearing empty and in need of a refill. I've seen his interaction with other customers and he is just as friendly and awesome. He recognizes us and never disappoints with his service. My favorite menu items are: Avo-cobb-o salad with honey mustard dressing or the guacomole bacon burger. It's even good if you substitute the beef patty with either a turkey patty or the Boca patty.... yes, I said Boca patty. It's the best veggie substitute that tastes close to beef. without having the funky texture. The garlic fries are awesome but you can't go wrong with the regular fries. If you get garlic fries, there is an extra charge though but it is bottomless. Whichever fries you order, make sure to get honey mustard on the side. This is hands down the best honey mustard anywhere. Can't find an analog in the grocery stores or other restaurants. If you are a honey mustard fan, this is the bomb. I wish I could buy this. It's that good. The strawberry lemonade is always often but I am particular to the peach iced tea. It's not as sweet as the strawberry lemonade but just as refreshing. I love coming here because it is not overwhelmingly crowded and not hectic. This is a great location for a yummy meal. Other locations, you will have to fight for parking, wait for a table, and feel like your cramped. Not at this Lincoln location. It's just an awesome location. If you have a chance to eat in the bar area, I hope that you have a chance to be taken care of by Noe.

26,Jon G.,"Roseville, CA",48,7,,1.0,2017-03-31,"I have never been a huge fan of Red Robin's but generally it's adequate to good. This Res Robin was one of my worst dining experiences ever. Right off the bat with the host did this place already turn me off of it. I walk in and there's no one at the podium, ok that's fine, as I wait I'm looking around and I see an employee in the dining area straight ahead talking to two gentlemen at the table. I figured he was the host and being genial with patrons, so at first I was fine with the wait. After quite a few minutes he walks up and seats me in the same area as those guys he was talking to and here is when I find out that they weren't guest but merely his coworkers that were on break. He made me wait pointlessly just because he wanted to gossip and not do his damn job. This was strike number one for this place. Once we are seated my waitress wasn't that polite and welcoming at all. Was rushing us a bit but hey we came in at a bit before 9:00PM maybe she was getting off soon, so I can forgive her a bit. She took our orders and the appetizers arrived promptly afterward. The cheese sticks were good but the tavern fries were just depressing, the fries were cold and the cheese wasn't fully melted. Every time I would grab a fry to try another one hoping the previous one was a fluke and eventually it'll be good but it never happened. Finally after that pile of depression our burgers arrived and it did not get any better. I got the black & bleu burger and something about the flavor just didn't taste right compared to previous Red Robin's. I took 3 bites and called it a day. The side of fries that came with was just another spiral of depression with how far this rabbit hole of disgust could go. My girlfriend said her burger was bad and that we could've got tastier food from dumpster diving behind an Applebee's that shared a dumpster with a dog kennel.  Overall I will only ever come to this Red Robin again if I'm forced by gunpoint to go in though I'd rather taste the bullet than taste the food here ever again.

However, yesterday we decided to drop in for a late lunch and grab some food. Service was so-so for it being slow. The food on the other hand was super bland. We had artichoke dip that was not good, small portion and just not flat out not good. We both had wraps that were dry, not tight. The wife had avocado that looked like it was sitting out for 2 hours.

16,Brett C.,"Roseville, CA",24,4,12.0,1.0,2017-09-16,"Service is was ok?... But if you come expecting to have a few beers and watch some football, I'd think about going somewhere else. Manager, I'm guessing she was trying to see what is on offer then football, changes the Chanel and could figure out how to get it back to the game. Then they argued with us about changing of the Chanel's. Even the waiter said something about females and remote controls, not a good mix. If it wasn't for the good burgers and fries we'd go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.44,2.27,2.27,,2.338

13,Wendy W.,"Elverta, CA",0,12,,2.0,2017-10-15,We were very disappointed yesterday.  We love the breaded cod and we always get it with your delicious cole slaw.  Guess what?  We ordered it to go and the cole slaw had no dressing on it....just shredded cabbage and there were no lemon wedges or tartar sauce included.  What a waste...will have to check our order in the future IF we go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.32,2.21,2.21,,2.254
0,Victoria B.,"Newcastle, CA",3,28,7.0,5.0,2017-10-22,"This is my favorite go to restaurant in Lincoln. There is rarely if ever a wait for a table at the times we go (usually early dinner). The lunch rush can be pretty busy especially in the bar room but we did find a table. (Self seating in the bar- find a table and take it). The servers are usually on task and attentive. I actually like the table top check pay option, no waiting for a bill, change,etc-just pay and go! The burgers have always been fresh, juicy and full of flavor. The fries are good with unlimited refills. They will alter or make substitutions without a fuss and unless it's a premium upgrade, it's no cost! If you like turkey burgers, theirs is perfectly seasoned and juicy-really the best turkey patty I think I've ever had. The condiments they offer are also very good. And the campfire sauce, in my opinion, is so delicious I could drink it!  I haven't ordered a burger I didn't like but the Siracha double tavern is my current favorite, a perfect blend of flavors and just the right size. Don't forget to ask for campfire sauce on the side for dipping your fries an adding to the burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.36,2.24,2.24,,2.2880000000000003
10,Alicia F.,"Lincoln, CA",0,25,,2.0,2017-10-24,"I've been to this location three times and I've ordered takeout once. Every single time, the service is extremely slow. The utensils never seem to be entirely clean, the hamburgers look like the thin dry patties you get in bulk from the freezer section. The plates they serve on are strange orange plastic plates, like something you would use camping, or give a child to throw on the ground.  I do not recommend coming to this restaurant.  I give two stars instead of one because the hostess was delightful, considerate and opened the doors for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.28,2.25,2.25,,2.262
2,Emma K.,"Lincoln, CA",18,1,,1.0,2017-11-24,"Worst Red Robin I've ever been to.  Was on hold for 15 minutes on the phone just to see the wait time. The waiter didn't talk to us for 10 minutes.  Was very rude to us when taking the order. Yelling ""I can't hear a word you're saying to my little brothers that are in elementary school. I have celiac desiese, so I ordered a gluten free but and gluten free fries. When the waiter didn't ask me if it was an allergy I told him that it was indeed and allergy and he responded ""well, yeah""   Once I got my food I took one bite into my burger and chocked on a hair. I was hacking and coughing at the table then proceeded to run to the bathroom. When I got back to the table (with the hair still stuck in my throat) the waiter and some guy came over and told me that the cooks were wearing hats...  After they left, I went to eat my ""gluten free fries"" they had seasoning salt on them. (Not gluten free)  I work at a Red Robin and I know how things SHOULD go. This was horrible.

1,Quincy Y.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-25,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I should have known it would be bad when we called to check wait times and were put on hold for 15 minutes. When we arrived, they told us to wait on the bench while they seated others who came in after us. Once seated, we were forced to wait around another 10 minutes for our server to offer us drinks, although we were ready to order food at that point. Our server was very rude and made us repeat ourselves multiple times when we were speaking quite clearly and loudly. He got things wrong and we had to correct him, almost writing down broccoli when we clearly said salad. My sister did not receive the usual request of ""pink or no pink"" for her burger and did not get to choose her cheese. She also choked on a huge hair found in her burger and almost threw up. The server and manager proceeded to make excuses and dodge responsibility. Incompetence in almost every regard by the staff and an all around TERRIBLE dining experience. Management needs to make serious changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.12,2.25,2.25,,2.1980000000000004
9,Maria C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-17,Took the family out last Saturday and paid thru the kiosk tool on the table. At the end of paying the kiosk had an error come up. Waitress said my payment didn't go through. I pulled up my banking info on my phone and showed where the charge is pending..so thought that would be enough. She brought the manager over and I showed her the same...They both confirmed that it wasn't going to go through and they closed that ticket. Made me run my card again which I didn't want to do. But my bank account wasn't enough proof for these people. Well guess what BOTH charges came out 2 days later and I'm still waiting to get my money back. Called and spoke to couple of different managers and get same response...I.T. is working on it...never get a courtesy call like promised..just horrible!! Oh best part I got a $15 Egift card for a meal that cost us $71!!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.08,2.25,2.25,,2.1820000000000004
17,Karen M.,"Rio Oso, CA",0,14,,1.0,2018-01-01,"I've only been to Red Robin a handful of times my whole life.  But the first couple times I went, I remember enjoying it.  Usually when we go out we pick Indian, Thai, or Japanese over anything else.  Over the years I've lost my taste for the larger chain restaurants.  But the other night we decided to take the whole family to Red Robin.  The service was decent.  I was concerned about that because of the reviews.  But we got in and were served pretty quickly.  But the California Chicken burger that I used to enjoy years ago was different from how I remembered it.  I remember it being more crisp.  But now it's soggy.  Overall, it was pricey for what we got, and most of us just felt icky after we left.  Also I ordered one of the special tequila margaritas.  So I paid several dollars more for a better brand of tequila, but I could tell that they skimped on the tequila.   Add to that there was a $1.99 entertainment fee added to the bill -presumably because my husband poked around for a few seconds on the device that was sitting on the table.   All together we spent over $25 more than if we'd gone to a good Indian or Thai restaurant, and it wasn't nearly as satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln,2.08,2.25,2.25,,2.1820000000000004
