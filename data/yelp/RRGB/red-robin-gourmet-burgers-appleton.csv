Josh B.,"Denmark, WI",16,46,5,5.0,11/17/2017,"This place is very family friendly and I can't get my kid to stop coming here.  Food is always great and cooked how we ask. I've had both average service and great service. With the Ziosks on the table it adds an option to get refills or extra food quick, as well as pay and go quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Jess F.,"Appleton, WI",69,169,1087,3.0,7/12/2016,"Stopped tonight for an unplanned family dinner.  Red Robin is an easy option with the kids as they have a large kids' menu that meets all tastes.  Their new kids' menu is even more complete - Burger, pizza, corn dogs, grilled cheese, chicken tenders, and the famous mac n cheese.  The serving of mac n cheese is small; however, it comes with free refills.  Be sure to ask of the refill as soon as you receive your meal - it takes a bit at times.  The kids' meals are also served with endless sides.  Lots of options there too - fries, apples, carrots, broccoli, oranges, etc. I've had several of RR's gourmet burgers.  They are good and flavorful.  My concern is always the price for the serving size.  RR also has a full bar; however, their beer selection is a bit weak.  And, the prices on their drinks (both alcohol and non-alcoholic) are really high. They also have tablets on the table that allows you to order drinks, apps, and desserts as well as pay your bill.  Watch the little ones as it's easy for them to pay the $2.99 for endless games while they wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Dao T.,"Appleton, WI",13,14,5,3.0,5/17/2017,"I came to Red Robin for the first time after the many years of driving past it.  The store looked pleasant and clean.  It's got a sports bar feel to it.  We were seated right away.  It took a while for our waitress to come because she was also training a new waiter.  The menu is huge.  I think it can use some consolidating.  Some of the burgers seemed very similar.  I rather have a few good items then a ton of mediocre options. I ordered the Southern Charm Burger with the garlic fries and a 22oz spotted cow.  My wife got the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with regular fries and a raspberry limeade.  The drinks came out quickly but our waitress spilt some of the drinks on to our table as she was giving them to us.  She apologized and used the napkins that were for us to wipe the spill.  She never brought us more napkins even though she said she would. The drinks tasted like how you would expect.  I believe the glass for the spotted cow was chilled which is always a plus.  The burgers didn't take too long to come out afterwards.  I order my burger with a little bit of pink.  I can't remember if they cooked it right or not but the burger tasted good.  I highly recommend you just ask them to bring another round of fries right away when you get your food.  The number of fries you get is lacking.  My burger although flavorful was also lacking in portion for the price of it.  My burger was supposedly a  1/2 lb. burger but I'm sure it was the same size as my wife's cheeseburger; which is supposed to be a smaller burger.  The waitress and waiter did check up on us periodically.  We were asked if we wanted more fries and gladly accepted the refill. Final verdict is that the prices are inflated for pretty much everything on the menu.  Serving sizes needs to be increased.  The initial serving of fries and the second round of fries equates to how much fries you would get at any other restaurant.  The food and service overall is just okay.  Having the ability to check yourself out with the tablets on the table was convenient.  We probably won't be coming back if we are craving for a good burger.  There are better burger joints in the Fox Valley in quality, flavor, and value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Brandon C.,"Summerville, SC",647,3,3,1.0,7/23/2017,"My experience here was awful. The waiter was so bad but wasn't good.

Karen L.,"Neenah, WI",0,3,,2.0,4/6/2017,"This place is a joke! Service was really slow. Once we got our food I noticed one side of the salt shaker was smashed in with broken glass. We told one of the wait staff walking by and he just looks at it and says okay. We had to ask for another one. The one and only time the waitress came by, we asked for more sodas. She said refills are not free. So we all got water instead. When we got the bill they charged extra for the little dab of sour cream. Couldn't believe they charge for every little thing. And the service was incredibly slow. You will only see your waitress once. I suggest going somewhere else, unless you have nothing but time and money to spare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Klay S.,"Plover, WI",0,62,15,1.0,1/2/2017,"The restaurant was nearly empty as we arrived after the lunch rush. We were stopped as hostess found out 2 servers only left.  We got Scott or Steve, older balding guy with pony tail and glasses. We ordered drinks and pretzels. My strawberry shake was a liquid and my daughter's sierra mist had something floating in it. We ordered.  We were able to get a fresh drink ordered for her as he passed us to wait on the only other people there who had to be put right next to us. I hate that!! So, no apologies, nothing.  We waited and waited, no one around. About 40 minutes later he brings this thing to us. I said, what is this? He says it is fried pickles....gross! He got order wrong, but says feel free to eat them...pass. About 20 minutes later we get our food. Our burgers were ordered well but came back as dry, charred shriveled up meat on a bun that the bottom is saturated with...idk what since my burger was juiceless. I took bottom off and ate rest. The fries were cold and broken and by the looks of them had been sitting for a while or were from another table. Our waiter never asked if we needed anything.  When he came to give us bill, 70 minutes after arrival...said he mentioned pretzels to 2 managers and still not there. Did i want them? Since my daughter had ordered as her main dish, would have been nice, but not at this point. He asked if i could use table kiosk to pay and left.  This is the third time we have been there...never been ""wowed"" but have never been so grossed out either. My 85 year old mother wanted fresh fries, but i suggested we leave befpre we were stuck there another hour. We will never return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Keri B.,"Appleton, WI",2,20,17,2.0,1/28/2017,"This is the 2nd time I've been at this Red Robin the past couple years.  Tonight, I remember why I didn't come back the first time.   My friend's son made the decision where to go to eat after the afternoon movie (Red Robin).  They got there about 1 minute before me.  When I walked in, they told me there's a 10 minute wait and it was shortly before 4pm.  We were waiting and at least 3 families came in and went to be seated right away.  We started looking at each other and her son said he was going to go ask why other people were being seated and we're not.  Just before he asked the lady told us we can follow her.  Walking through there was about 10 tables open.  Made no sense why we had to wait.   Sat down in a corner table and ordered our water and got the water right away.  Wasn't ready to order the food but had a couple questions.  Asked if the mushrooms was fresh or from a can.  Waitress didn't know and had to go ask and they're fresh.  Then my friend asked about the gluten free buns and the waitress had no clue about the gluten free buns.  We ordered our burgers and fries (mine was sweet potato fries).  I don't think it took more than 15 minutes for the burgers and fries to be on our table.  Waitress stopped by not even a minute later to ask how our meal was.  None of us even had time to taste the food yet so we told her it looks good.  When we started tasting our food, my medium burger was well done, my friends garden Boca burger was super dry, and her son didn't complain about his burger.  My friends son was all done eating fast and the next time the waitress stopped by the boy had to ask for more fries.  At least 10 minutes later, both of us girls were completely done eating and the boy never even got anymore fries.  I never understood about the bottomless fries and drinks.  You get a very small portion of fries at first and you never get anymore and they never refill the drinks (water) either.   I paid cash and my friend paid with a card and she had to use her card on that little machine on the table.  The machine totally jammed her receipt and it took more time for the waitress to come back. It wasn't a horrible experience but I definitely don't want to revisit for a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton

Kelly J.,"Appleton, WI",17,5,1,1.0,7/1/2016,"The new menu is a mistake.   I tried the new Nacho.m.g.   The cheese was Luke warm and there weren't many chips.   The chips are strips and we're kind of lame.   For $9.00 I expected some combination of bigger and/or better.   My son had the ribeye steak sandwich.   He said it tasted good but it was about the size of a Subway 6"" and the price was $14.95.   We should have either just stuck with the tried and true burgers or went someplace else.   I was very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Lara K.,"Appleton, WI",0,4,4,1.0,6/1/2016,I have eaten here many times and food was good. It still is good but quality has gone down. The speckled fruit salad had a mint leaf garnish that showed signs of decay and the fruit looked like it had been marinating for days.  Not fresh.  The surfaces behind the bar were dirty and quite noticeable in addition to a thick layer of dust on crown molding. It felt unclean. I probably won't go back. On a positive note the staff was friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton

Jenna T.,"Appleton, WI",0,6,1,1.0,6/5/2015,"The worst service I have ever had, hands down!  It took over 15 minutes to get drinks, which I then had to send back because they didn't even uncap my beer (which was $5.30 for a bottle). They never brought us menus, had to hunt someone down and ask for them after 20 minutes of waiting. We waited over an hour and a half for food and when they brought it out, it was cold.

Doug S.,"Appleton, WI",0,5,,1.0,7/5/2015,"After our last terrible experience our family attempted to give this location another chance. Walked in at 7:15 pm on Sunday night to the same scene - maybe 1/2 the restaurant full with a third of the empty tables dirty. The hostess said she would have to bus a table for us before we could be seated. She cleared the dishes, walked away, and then the table just sat! After five more minutes of us waiting, the hostess never coming back, and the table continuing to sit ""unbussed"" we walked out. The saddest part is we still have the $30 gift card Red Robin gave us to come back and give them a second chance!! What a disgrace for what once was a great family restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton

John D.,"Greenville, WI",0,24,3,1.0,4/3/2016,"We've been coming here for years and for the past 12-18 months, it's really gone downhill.  Today was the last straw.  We were seated and I had to ask the server 3 times to wipe down the table.  Then they got our drinks wrong.  40 minutes into our wait, no refills and still no food and the server told us that they are all out of corndogs so we decided to leave.  On the way Out, we told the manager that we are leaving and not paying for drinks And he said that they had corn dogs on their way. I'm not sure how they could do that on a Sunday night, unless they went to the grocery store next-door. Probably won't be going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Tracy P.,"Green Bay, WI",0,3,3,1.0,6/25/2015,"Stopped in about 1pm on a weekday & the place was gross! I counted 14 dirty tables. The knife they gave me had dried food on it. Even though the dining room had just a few occupied tables we waited a LONG time for our first greeting and then our food took WAY too long, even if it had been a full dining room. I was amazed how many times the servers and manager walked past the dirty tables. I did not understand why they would not at least grab a few dishes each time they walked past. We did get drink refills but only because we had to flag our server down and ask. I typically love Red Robin but this location/ experience was far from good or even acceptable. Saving grace was the food was good and consistent (other than my sweet potato fries were cold) to what we expect from Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton
Carolyn T.,"Riverside, IL",403,402,922,3.0,4/2/2013,"The serving size of the food was perfect. Most of the time, I have leftovers after going out to eat, but I ate absolutely everything on my plate. I left feeling satisfied and not at all stuffed with food.  My boyfriend got a bottomless root beer float, which we both shared. Maybe that's tacky, but I knew there was no way I'd be able to finish one of those myself!  I chose the fruit salad as my side and the waiter let me know that they had not updated the menu yet, but that the I had to pay extra for it. We paid the extra $ for the fruit salad, but it was really small and not particularly fresh. It tasted a little wilted, like it had been sitting in a huge bowl of fruit salad in the fridge overnight.  The vegetarian options were pretty decent and what I would expect of a place like Red Robin. I opted for the veggie burger, which was your standard BOCA burger that anyone could buy frozen from the grocery store. The whole burger (with bun and fillings) tasted overall just fine, though. I would say that Red Robin is a bit overpriced for what you get (very standard American food), but I enjoyed my meal nevertheless.  Note: There's a model of the Statue of Liberty that greets you when you walk in. Kitschy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton

C L.,"Appleton, WI",0,8,,2.0,11/22/2015,This place has gone downhill. The quality of their burgers has definitely suffered as their prices have gone up.

Coleton S.,"Appleton, WI",0,3,3,1.0,12/27/2014,"Something has gone horribly wrong at this location. We (two people) came here at 3:00 in the afternoon for a late lunch. We were asked to wait twenty minutes. But as we looked around we saw empty tables. We finally went and counted during our near half hour wait. 27 empty tables! Big tables. Small tables. Two-tops all over the place. And yet, there was a 20 minute wait for two people at 3:00 in the afternoon. This place is poorly managed, and it looks and feels like they have no idea what they're doing. It's too bad, because the servers are friendly and the food is good. We'd love to come here more, but the first impression makes you wonder about how well the kitchen is run and the food is produced. Come at your own risk. Hopefully you can dodge the insults flying across the room from waiter to waitress (a server was loudly reprimanded in front of several tables). I'm certain you'll get your food, and it'll taste great when you do... you may just have to wait an hour, in a room full of empty tables, for one burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton?start=20

David A.,"Euless, TX",4,34,19,4.0,1/2/2014,Yum.... I like this place a lot.

Matt O.,"Appleton, WI",0,65,4,4.0,8/31/2011,"Great specialty / themed burgers. The RedRobin burger is by far a must have... at least once. The thing that makes it so interesting is the fried egg on top... don't tell RedRobin but I sometimes put a fried egg on my burger at home now! The other nice thing is the bottomless steak fries and beverages. If you are looking for a health alternative; don't fret. You can always order a chicken sandwich, Bocca Burger, or any other combination of protein on lettuce or in a wrap (watch the calories on wraps... from what I can tell RR's wraps are slightly less than a bun; so there is a little savings there).

Dave L.,"Appleton, WI",1,30,15,2.0,10/15/2012,"Red Robin is a place we go to 3 or 4 times a year.  Usually the service and food is pretty good.  Yesterday, the overall service was on the backside of below average.  We walked into the lobby to find two pans catching rain dripping from the roof.  We were seated immediately but after waiting 10 minutes (in a restaurant that was half-full) and watching wait-staff and cooks goofing around in the kitchen area, I finally had to ask a hostess if someone was assigned our table.  The waitress that finally came to our table was friendly and did a nice job.  When we ordered, the waitress broke the news to me that causes me to rarely consider going back to a restaurant, ""Sorry, we are out of that item"".  In this case, it was the pretzel bun for the ""special"" that was advertised on a huge board in the lobby and in everyone of the menus at the table. Inexcusable and usually a sign of poor management.  The burger I ended up ordering was the guacamole burger.  A good burger, however, I had to ask for the waitress to bring some guacamole as the cook had apparently decided a 1/4 teaspoon should suffice.  Lastly, one of our party used the men's restroom and reported that the garbage can was overflowing and there were paper towels all over the floor.  Overall, not an experience that will bring me back to that particular restaurant anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-appleton?start=20
