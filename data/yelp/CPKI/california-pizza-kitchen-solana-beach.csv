Andy D.,"Encinitas, CA",66,1,4,2.0,10/5/2016,We ordered a small chopped salad.  I am so disappointed.  Not only is it much smaller than it was in past years.  The quality has changed.  I looks like airport food or a McDonald's salad.  The chicken doesn't even look like real chicken.  I will never go back based on this meal. How sad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20

Over the next 15 minutes many staff members walked by refusing to acknowledge our presence. No one stopped by to take a beverage or food order.  We decided to leave and walk across the plaza to eat.

I tried the new tricolor salad pizza it was delicious. For dessert we all shared the butter cake! It was a huge piece with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! Even the four of us couldn't finish it all. All in all good food, good service and very affordable! A family of four can walk out full for around $60. Great deal in my book.

So flavorful!! Delicious!! My son had a bowl of the potato soup, he described it as a Thanksgiving dinner!! Haha My other son ordered a Cobb Salad with Chicken!! What a BIG portion!!

Lysabeth L.,"San Diego, CA",139,299,217,5.0,9/23/2014,"The perks of working at a school with a year round schedule is that when most are just starting school, I'm already on vacation! Yes, it's Fall Break and I'm totally loving it! One of the things I love to do when on vacation (and every other day at that) is eat! I'm always up for a great meal!  The restaurant has undergone a complete transformation, from the design and décor to the menu. The Solana Beach location is among the first in the country to roll out the new design and menu items, with other locations to follow. The vibe in the restaurant was casual and very ""SoCal""! The staff was very excited to share the highlights of the new items on the menu. They were all very friendly, knowledgeable, and inspired with the new changes for CPK!  Hubby tried the Fire-Grilled Ribeye: A 12-oz. USDA choice ribeye grilled with housemade Pinot Noir sea salt and topped with creamy bleu cheese butter. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic arugula salad. It was tender, juicy, and everything a great steak should be! I tried the Hearth-Roasted Halibut: Wild caught from the Aleutian Islands, roasted on a cedar plank with butternut squash farro and grilled asparagus. The flavors were rich and definitely made my tummy happy!

Valeria N.,"Helotes, TX",0,1,,5.0,4/12/2017,Wow! The staff is great! The manager and our server Mikey were really good to us. Did not expect California pizza kitchen to have such an amazing and efficient team. Definitely dining at this location again just for the outstanding service. The Sicilian pizza is the best. And the bianco flatbread. The butter cake for dessert was pretty good but it was very very sweet so I would recommend to split between 4-5 people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20

Bijan A.,"Encinitas, CA",1,1,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Me and my Mother, both of whom have good palettes and can actually cook, anonymously agreed that while the service was adequate, the food not only lacked in substantial taste but also size portions. While this review can only be limited to the dishes we tried, (and probably the last we will ever try) which were the Salmon in the main dishes section of the menu, and the Hawaiian Pizza (a personal favorite of mine); we were underwhelmed by the severe lack of seasoning on the salmon, and portion size for a whopping $20; and the lack of flavor and blandness on the pizza which costed us $14, which tasted similar to, if not worse than a store bought pizza for 5 dollars.  The evening out which I anticipated to be at-least somewhat decent since I'd seen the place had been renovated and items where priced higher around the $15-25 range, unfortunately turned sour quickly. When we got there, we were shown good customer service. We took a while to order since everything was priced so high and even asked how large the portion sizes were and were told we would be adequately fed, so I anticipated no predicaments in relation to being fed enough. While we decided we were given delicious fresh baked rosemary bread with an olive oil basil dip (which I thought was a little too oily and could've used some balsamic vinaigrette). But after we ordered the salmon and the Hawaiian Pizza and got them we noticed a multitude of unacceptable problems that paying $34 for two people is not what you'd expect for the food to have. First, the Salmon, seasoned with paprika and butter (which for the record is NOT what you season salmon with, I haven't a clue what they were thinking when they thought that would taste good). Butter is just more fat, something that drowns out the tender flavor of salmon and offers an oil that fish doesn't need. And paprika which is primarily used to give food an orange hue, doesn't offer any saltiness or spice or sourness that makes fish so delicious, it's just food coloring to pretend something has flavor. The Salmon was a completely bland, narrow strip no more than a few inches longer than my pointer finger and index finger stretched out together, with tasteless broccoli which I asked in place of the white corn which would've undoubtedly have been worse. Granted me and my mother split the Salmon dish and the 11' Hawaiian pizza but even after both we felt underfed. And I am by no means a heavy eater, or fat for that matter. And when we talked to the manager working there, complaining about the lack of flavor, and how we payed $20 for tasteless crap she dismissed us by saying, ""It's part of what we do, to add little seasoning so the customer can add their own salt and pepper."" I was infuriated talking with mom about how, ""If you pay $20 for Salmon you're expecting it to have it's own unique flavor to it, you're expecting something to be cooked with perfect seasoning before you cook it in a correct portion size, not the customer literally adding salt and pepper from the table onto it to give it flavor and having the salt and pepper roll off the top cuz the Salmon is already cooked and none of those flavors were cooked into the salmon."" If it had been cooked onto the salmon with a little lime juice it would've made it much more delicious. It's ridiculous, when you go out to eat, you the customer, especially if you're paying $20 for Salmon, are expecting well prepared food better than you could cook on your own at home. That's part of the whole premise of eating out, taking a break from cooking yourself, and eating good food, and I can honestly tell you, that is miles away from the experience I had. Moving on to the Hawaiian Pizza, like I stated before, for $14 I could gone to Blaze's pizza and gotten nearly two build your owns, choosing each and every flavor I'd want, to make it far more delicious than what we were served. Similarly you could go to Round Table Pizza and get a $14 with a uniquely designed pizza with a hundred more toppings than the mediocre pizza we got that was no better than a store bought basic pizza. After being completely dissatisfied and being told straight up, ""We are the only ones they've heard that have complained about their food,"" we told them every aspect of our dissatisfaction, and the manager feeling sorry, said she would give us a free desert. The desert I had was a cake with basic vanilla ice cream on top, and, NO Joke literally whipped cream from a spray can...I mean come on, I can spray cream onto a loaf cake I buy from a store for $2 and stick a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and charge someone close to $10 dollars, I mean it was free for us, but for the poor sucker paying $10 for something with such a little amount of complexity to it is laughable.  I would never recommend to anyone, going to California Pizza Kitchen, there are MUCH BETTER ways to spend $20 on Salmon or $14 on pizza. I regret ever coming here and it was a complete waste of money. Don't buy into their scam!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20
Drew L.,"San Diego, CA",301,280,432,2.0,5/9/2015,"Prelims: the interior looks like every other CPK in the world, with a bar, some booth seating, some regular seating, and a full view of the pizza making process. I went at lunch time on a Saturday so I didn't get the lunch deal of half pizza and salad. The lighting is pretty good, it's spacious, and it's located in a plaza with plenty of parking. But I came on a Saturday so take it with a grain of salt, although it is Solana Beach so maybe parking is never an issue.  I set aside a specific paragraph for the service. Normally I couldn't give a rat's behind about service because I come to restaurant to eat food, not to be served. As a former worker in the service industry, I know and understand that service is oftentimes very dependent on other customers, the kitchen, and a lot of other things outside of a server's control and they shouldn't be penalized on the tip just because they are the face of the disaster that's slowly detonating behind them. But in this case, I am fuming over the way that I was treated at this location. I came as a single. Yes, the fiancee was sleeping after work - I'm a sad, sad little man. I came after playing ball for 2 hours and then having a light workout at the Fit Athletic Club next door (SHOUT OUT TO TRISH FOR THE YELP FIT EVENT! YOU'RE AWESOME!!!) so I was understandably starving for some sort of protein. Hell, for any sort of food. But as a single, I don't really represent a lot in terms of tip. So if I'm a little lower on the priority list, fine. Whatever. I was seated at a booth and it takes 15 minutes for the server to come and tell me that she would be ""right with me"". 10 minutes later, water. ""Right with me""...right.... So after 25 minutes, I finally get to order. I order the Works pizza. 8 minutes later, she comes and offers me bread. I refuse out of principle that this is taking forever and the fact that I need to watch my figure. It takes another 18 minutes for the food to get to me. So a starving single man needs to wait 40 minutes to get his food - while the mom and daughter sitting behind me gets seated 10 minutes after me, gets orders in within 5 minutes, and gets their food, all before I even order. They finished eating when I GOT my food and left while I was eating. Are you kidding me? While the server makes apologies, in this case, all apologies are excuses.  The food was standard. The works pizza is with sausage, bell pepper, red onion, and oregano. It was ok. But the food was totally spoiled because I was sitting there playing with my phone for a solid 40 minutes. I left after one hour; 15 minutes to eat. One hour for a single person to sit, order and eat. Objectively, the food was standard; it tasted like a pizza and I only ate half because I was past the point of hungry and I saved the rest. If you are desperate for pizza in this area, I would recommend putting your craving off and eating at Rubio's next door. Better food, better service. I regret putting down $18 (yes, I still tipped. You should too) for a substandard lunch. If I'm not worth your time, serve me faster so that other customers get my table. Whatever. Lesson is seriously learned.    TL;DR Don't come alone or they treat you like you are not worth their time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20

Fritz H.,"Del Mar, CA",6,43,51,1.0,10/4/2014,"Have been coming here for many years - usually when we wanted an uninspired but consistently adequate meal, acceptable service - notwithstanding the creepy older busboy that leers at little boys, and a comfortable unpretentious feeling.   But this was our first time in since they redid the concept and design.  A freakin' grand disaster!  Service was AWFUL!  Food was late and orders wrong.  The whole remodel looks cheap (IKEA?) and appears to be trying to capture the small local farm to table silliness - chalkboards, lotsa raw wood, Brussels sprouts and over easy eggs on pizza, er now ""flatbread"".  (Is the name changing to California Flatbread Kitchen? Ha ha). But the absolute worst part is they took out the noise reducing improvements the previous team had added.  The ambient noise is bounced around that room so badly and so many times it is impossible to carry on a conversation without raising your voice.  The waiter had to come stand next to each of us and lean in to hear.  Even then things had to be repeated.  And the joke is that much of the staff are wearing the headsets - the hostesses, the head chef, the busboys, - like they're working crowd control at a hip hop concert.  Effing joke.  Doubt we'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=60

The kids were tired from the party so I was worried about getting them fed and watered quickly. The hostess sat us right away and our server was there instantly to take our drink order. After we ordered, our food came out very quickly. The girls got the kids Mac and cheese and our son got the kids Hawaiian pizza. They all loved their meals and there was enough for lunch the next day. The hubs and I shared the Brussels and bacon flat bread and the pear and gorgonzola pizza. Both were outstanding. The Brussels sprouts were just slightly cooked so they were still crunchy on the flat bread. It was really good. Everything was great, especially since I was worried that the kids would self combust.

Choose your favorite salad and have it put on the tricolor pizza crust undercooked (make sure you ask for it undercooked or else it will come out too crispy). This is a healthier option giving you a satisfying meal without having to choose between a salad and a pizza. Best of both worlds! We love the half order Chinese chicken salad on the crust.

Valerie P.,"Boise, ID",2,13,,1.0,8/16/2014,"If I was writing this review a year ago, it would have been four stars. Today, I feel that giving one start is generous. Read on to hear me out.  I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant. My boyfriend and I ended up spending our entire Friday night date talking about writing this yelp review to warn others in the community.  First complaint: Waitstaff  We were greeted by 5 people hanging out at the host stand-excessive and overwhelming when you walk in. Two different hosts put their fingers on our plates before they set them in front of us...  If you haven't been recently, they've renovated and changed their menu. The new furniture is a bunch of cheap decor trying to be modern but ended up being inconvenient- our table was uneven and the coasters too thin to slip under the table legs. In fact, the coasters were so thin, they didn't even absorb the condensation from our glasses. Yet again giving off a cheap vibe.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted another entree when she came to take our entree plate... I've never heard of that before. Who goes and buys two rounds of entrees? Wouldn't you just order them at the same time? She complained to us that another server took our drink orders before she could get to our table, unprofessional. Later  our waitress was audibly arguing with other waitstaff before bringing our check.. unprofessional.  Not to mention, while sitting on the patio two children were running around and yelling without their shoes off trying to touch the fire in the heaters. Unique to our experience, but added to our frustration.  Second major complaint: Food & Drinks Our drinks were severely watered down and overpriced for sure... who orders a margarita and doesn't even feel it?!  A little picky in some points in my review? probably. The whole time my boyfriend kept saying, at least the food tastes good! At least our meal is good.  But here's the kicker..... My boyfriend got food poisoning from his sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni pizza.  It had to be that because we ate all of the same food all day leading up to the entree!  CPK used to be great! We enjoyed going out once and a while.... but that will be our last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=40

The pizza was on a very thin but edible crust that did not taste rice floury - like some of gf stuff does. However, the crust does come out of the fridge / freezer so is not that fresh - from what I can tell. Everything else was pretty standard toppings. I felt it was really nice to have the option and CPK has definitely trained their employees on how to avoid cross contamination (new gloves, own baking dish, different prep area), but in the end Udis frozen is pretty much the same thing and about $4 cheaper.

With a teenager and preteen trailing along, someone's usually not happy at any restaurant we go to! This one trumps them all. We're all happy! I have to say, there's been some great changes in the last year or so. I had complained on one of their surveys about the cold bread they bring to the table when you order your drinks. I suggested warm, out-of-the-oven bread and dipping oil. Well, they must have listened (I'd like to think it was all me!) because now they're serving just that! Totally made a difference to me!  Next, they just need to add more greens to their Tri Colore Salad/Pizza. I used to get it and it had piles of greens. Now they don't even cover half the pizza bread.

Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761,3.0,7/18/2016,"Service here was slightly lacking on a Sunday night (6/18/2016). We walked into the restaurant where 4 different staff members were standing, talking around the host stand and failed to acknowledge us until a few moments later (including a manager). We were finally noticed and taken to a table (you could tell the host had no idea where to sit us at first). I don't mind tables at all so that wasn't a problem for us - just had to add that.  Although our server, Julie, was friendly, I received my drink and my friend didn't receive his beer until a good amount of time later (from the bar tender).  After we received our drinks, it really took a while for her to return to take our orders. I was pretty hungry so this was quite frustrating. She asked if we wanted bread, in which case of course I said yes being the starch-freak that I am. Bread was brought out promptly and devoured fast. I always love the bread and olive oil combo at CPK - it's one of my favorites. We eventually received our food (not from our server) and were asked if we needed anything else (pepper for the salad, etc). I tried a few slices of the Roasted Garlic Chicken my friend ordered and thought it was excellent! I hadn't tried this particular pizza yet, so I may go ahead and order it again the next time I find myself at CPK. As for my Caesar Salad, I think the quality and taste of their Caesar's have gone down in the past few years. It didn't taste as good as it used to. In fact, as mentioned in a previous CPK review at a different location, it seems like their food and portion sizes have gone down indefinitely. For some reason (maybe because I love pizza), I still find myself coming back even with these negative changes - haha.  All in all, this location's layout is unique (as I find most CPK locations to be), but I think I'd try something different if I'm in this area again.

Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,3.0,3/9/2015,"I recently revisted CPK and learned that they had revamped their menu. There are now a lot of non-pizza options, which is great because I've never been super impressed by their pizza. I decided to try the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken and actually found the dish to be very good. The sauce was amazing and there was plenty of sundried tomatoes to add extra flavor. The portion size proved to be plenty for two meals for me. Unfortunately, my man didn't care for his Tostada Thin Crust pizza at all. Although it's topped with black beans and cheese, the lettuce seemed to overwhelm the pizza. The tiny bit of ranch drizzle and the side of salsa didn't add enough moisture to overcome the lack of a sauce. He thought that each slice made a better taco than a pizza. We also had some trouble communicating with our waitress. We signed up for the Pizza Dough while we were at the table and tried to get her to add the points to our card but we don't think that it happened. She tried to tell us that she already added it but we hadn't given her the number yet. We eventually just gave up. On the plus side though, you get a free small plate for signing up and we were able to redeem that. We chose the White Corn Guacamole and Chips and thought that it was pretty good.

Jeff J.,"West New York, NJ",4,41,,3.0,9/4/2012,"Notable stars sprinkled throughout this menu. After moving to the east coast, there's not much that stands out about the pizza from this place. Then again, there's a couple things I'll admit I miss a little bit. The BBQ chicken pizza was always a big hit with me. It's sweet, tangy and a real good pizza.  Growing up, this was always the place my mom wanted to go for her birthday. At night, it gets crowded, so try to make a reservation. She raved about their salads. Since I haven't tried one, I can't give any other insight into it.  What stood out to me was their chicken caesar sandwiches served on herb cheese focaccia bread. Note to self: I got to find out how to make this bread. Anyways, it's served with a cup of soup on the side; they used to offer this awesome one, the adobe chicken chowder -- a tad of spice, not too much chicken and some crispy tortilla chip strips laid on top added a nice crunch to it. My school was close to this place, so for lunches, we often ordered it to go. It became the usual go to place for a quick pick up and affordable, yet delicious, lunch. This brings me to my next point. My favorite part about CPK: roadside service. Simply pull up to the tent marked as such, and that's it. Let the waiter/waitress come to you. It's easy, convenient and best of all, fast. No waiting for a table. Only friendly, curbside pick up. If only everything was this easy. Just remember, try to leave a small tip. These waiters/waitresses/curbside hosts/hostesses need some lovin' too.  I'm proud to say to my east coast friends that I'll be back when I'm in the area.

Alain G.,"Encinitas, CA",3,29,,2.0,12/1/2012,"I kind of wish I could enjoy California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) more than I really do.  Because there are just so many good things about this restaurant!  However, every time I go I just end up thinking ""meh."" Let's start with the pros.  The food isn't bad.  The menu is a nice mix between standard pepperoni pizza choices and slightly more adventurous Gorgonzola/pine nut/pear pizza options.  I like adventurous pizza so this aspect to the restaurant appeals to me.  CPK is also a chain located in several areas around San Diego including Solana Beach, La Jolla and downtown San Diego area (off Friars Road).  These locations make it a reliable, convenient choice.  I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes at any location.  So if you're starving, it's the kind of place you know you could get into on a Friday/Saturday night in areas of San Diego that normally tend to be more crowded. The cons?  While the food isn't bad, it's not great either.  Nothing I've had at CPK has been especially memorable.  I don't mind eating the food but there's really nothing ""signature"" about a CPK pizza.  I would just as soon get a pizza from any other place. However, I will admit that CPK is a great place to take kids.  It's definitely a step up from Pizza Hut but still has the kind of things that kids like to eat.  So as a family outing it's a good option.  As a going out on the town with your date option?  Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=80

I really think the thick bland tortillas overpower this dish and take away from its Mediterranean lightness. For my main course I had the Thai linguine, pasta with a zesty peanut thai sauce, bean sports and carrots, it is a nice flavor change from the usual fair.  I added a good amount of red pepper to up the spice, however the poor service meant i finished 1/2 of my dish before the red pepper arrived. At my table people ordered the mushroom ravioli in the garlic cream sauce which was good, as was the kung pao spaghetti.  What I do wonder is why must it be so noisy?  They pump up the music, so everyone talks louder, the open kitchen noise and the unfinished ceilings make it hard to even order on a busy night.

We had been on our weekend Harley ride all day and stopped in a quick bite for dinner. Once seated at our table we waited about 20 mins for the waiter to come over and greet us. Once he did he was really blunt and stuck up. He was a Mexican guy and a few of us in the group Spanish is our first language meaning we are more comfortable speaking that language. One of our party started ordering in Spanish and he stopped her in the middle of her drink order and told her in his broken English "" I espeaka english, OK!"" little rude fuck!! She looked at us like I cant believe he just said that. She then continued in English for this guy. We all ordered drinks and the guy disappeared for another 20 mins. Finally the manager came over to check on us, then our drinks appeared. We made sure to order while we had the guy there. He was supper annoyed by us and his attitude sure as hell showed it. The manager came over and was checking on us while this guy was MIA our food finally showed up. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and it was very dry even at the point of starving the food was just ""OK"". We ate our food and the only time this guy was on it was when he brought the check. I paid $40 for a salad and a 10"" pizza that taste like bread with melted cheese with dried out ham and dehydrated pineapple on it.  I think this guy needs a job somewhere behind the scenes and not dealing with customers I am not saying fire him but put him somewhere else.

As pizza, we chose the gorgonzola, pear variety. This pizza went perfectly with our salad, was mild and just a touch sweet, great crust.

Next time I'll order it without the ice cream and ask for more vanilla cream. The texture was a dream, so was the flavor. Rich chocolate, not too sweet, warm and creamy, not goopey - just perfect.

Roslyn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,2/6/2013,"Words cannot describe how utterly horrific it is to make a togo order from this place. They have some train wreck of a call center in Colorado that takes your order, then sends it to your specific location. That is, if you can understand to which location they are referring and if your order will ever make it to the one that you ""called"". The operators call Solana Beach by the name of the shopping center (did anyone know that center even had a name??) and pronounce La Jolla ""luh jawla"". And that's honestly just irritating; the truly bad part is that they ALWAYS MESS UP YOUR ORDER: I ask to substitute shrimp, I end up with chicken still tossed into my salad and a side of hot shrimp. I ask for bread, nope, no bread. When every single person insists dressing comes one the side, the one time I finally stop requesting dressing on the side, my salad comes drenched. The other part of the call center that drives me insane is how many times the call has cut out in the middle of ordering. You then have to call back, hope you remember the person's name, and try to confirm that your order made it to the restaurant and wasn't lost somewhere over the rockies. Then, to top it all off, they try to upsell you some ""delicious slice of key lime pie"" or an ""iced cold beverage' its like no, thanks, if I wanted that I'd order it, please just listen to what I DO want and maybe you'll get it right for once. Either every single person in that call center has had a lobotomy or is enjoying Colorado's newly passed marijuana laws a little too much because I have yet to come across one who is competent. Bottom line: wish I could count how many times I've just gone home to eat frozen deli-mex taquitos from 1998 over having to deal with CPK's togo issues. The service inside is equally as bad so dining in isn't exactly a viable option either.

This CPK is one of a sizable chain...and for a chain restaurant..it has a formula that basically works: good food, fresh ingredients, decent enough prices and a full service bar. One thing I always appreciate about any CPK...is that they offer whole wheat dough as a substitution for any pizza's regular white dough crust. Now here's a little known fact, they will also cheerfully substitute this whole wheat dough for the white dough in their hummus and bruschetta appetizers. This makes them delicious and even more nutritious! The quality of service is really the only point of contention I hold with CPK...and this location is no exception. You see...CPK was the brain child of a trio of attorneys...their formula is a strict one...but, in my experience, is strict on the wrong level. Every CPK server is grilled extensively on the ingredient listing of the CPK menu. But folks...waiting tables effectively..with intelligence, warmth and common sense...is a far different test than the by rote memorization of a menu. Thus, service at any CPK is often hit and miss. More often...it is a hit (or is at least semi-competent)...but when your waiter is unable to help you select a wine..and doesn't seem to be able to competently open the bottle...the wrong training is being stressed and enforced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=100

However, I'm usually a huge fan of New York style thin pizzas and I wasn't expecting to like anything pizza with California in the title.  I'm no hippy and I don't eat vegetables, so why would I? The Jamaican Jerk Pizza, though, blew my freaking mind.  Even though I get a stomach-ache EVERY SINGLE time I eat it, I can't stop.  I'd eat that pizza every day for breakfast lunch and dinner. As for this location in particular, it's a chain restaurant.  What do you expect?  Just try the Jerk and you won't regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=100
Steph L.,"San Diego, CA",66,175,6,4.0,5/9/2007,"I don't have much to add to Julie's review.  The only 2 things I ever eat there are: Tostada Pizza.   Sounds gross, but it's oh so good: Black beans, sharp cheddar and monterey jack cheese, topped with lettuce, fresh tomatoes, green onions and crispy tortilla strips with garden-herb ranch dressing. Tomato Basil Spaghettini.  Thin spaghetti with imported Italian tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil.  I've eaten at CPKs all over the country, and the consistent good taste of their food never ceases to amaze me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=100
G J J.,"San Francisco, CA",13,570,,5.0,10/14/2007,"High marks for most CPKs.  Taco Pizza, Margharita. 'Nuff said, really.  Tiramisu is decent, and so are the salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=100
Chad V.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,29,1.0,7/12/2010,"Don't eat here unless you enjoy having PUBIC HAIR in your pizza. Because that's what happened to me. It was not just a normal hair, but clearly a pubic hair. The way the situation was handled by ""the Management"" was also unheard of. They tried to bill me for the two salads that we had before we got our Pubic Hair special surprise, instead of comping the bill which is what you do...UNBELIEVABLY shitty experience and horrible customer service skills. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=120
Tom R.,"Nipomo, CA",0,49,,3.0,2/7/2010,"For a chain, CPK does a very good job.  Lots of interesting stuff, well prepared, on the menu.  Some favorites have disappeared in recent months.  Some of the replacements were very interesting, some were not. The service is good but not great.  The only major complaint I have is the noise at this particular location of CPK.  The place seems to have been deliberately constructed to maximize the noise level.  I know that some restauranteurs believe that customers find a place with a high noise level to be ""exciting"".  If you, like me, prefer to be able to carry on a conversation without raising your voice, don't go to this location when the restaurant is more than half full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=120
paige m.,"San Diego, CA",100,209,1,4.0,7/8/2008,"cpk is awesome, obviously.   the selections are diverse... where else will you see pear gorgonzola pizza, tostada  pizza, bbq pizza, mango tandori pizza and greek pizza on the same menu?  and they pull them all off.salads are good, pizzas are good, appetizers are good, pastas are boring.   what kind of sucked is, while eating with the fam, my mom asked for a booth instead of the chairs they put us at, and the hostess said they couldn't give that server any more tables..and guess what?  another group of 4 got the booth literally 1 min after us.  one other complaint is that we got the hummus appetizer and ran out of pita.  we asked for extra pita and it came after they removed the hummus from the table.  so we had pita that we paid for, but no hummus..  so that's my justification for docking  a star from a place that has always been totally consistent, reliable and yummy.  i recommend it wholeheartedly if you're looking for some fun pizza and salads.   also they do curbside to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=120
Craig Y.,"Del Mar, CA",4,45,,2.0,2/1/2011,"Let me first say that I've always been a big fan of CPK.  It's of course a little pricey for what it is but the food is very consistent and of good quality.  Ever since my daughter was little, it has been her favorite restaurant--from Manhattan Beach to Fort Lauderdale to Beverly Hills.  But I have to say that this restaurant is not one of the better ones in the chain.  It's one of the smaller layouts and consequently the atmosphere is not very good.  If you get a booth near the windows it's fine but if you have the sit on the kitchen side of the partition, it feels crowded.  The service is hit or miss--they have some very good waiters but also some distracted ones. (They do have one GREAT busboy though--an older gentleman that seems to have been there forever).  The parking is almost always difficult (I can't believe the parking lot passed the city code with so few spaces for the number of businesses).  We live in Del Mar but are ready to start driving to the La Jolla restaurant for our CPK fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=120

Aluna Y.,"La Mesa, CA",2,157,,3.0,6/9/2010,"CPK as it is - nothing special. The same quality and the same food you would find in any other CPK location.

Pete B.,"Solana Beach, CA",5,172,3,1.0,2/2/2009,"CPK has very ordinary food that's a step up from Denny's. Pizza and salads are ordinary and the bread is awful. It's typical of chain restaurants that take little pride in using fresh vegetables or local ingredients. If you want pizza and salads Pizza Nova, a mile or two away is far superior. And it's locally owned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=120
