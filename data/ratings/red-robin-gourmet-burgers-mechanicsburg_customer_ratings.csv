49,Dave P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",3,102,,3.0,2012-02-28,"I don't like to write reviews about chains, but here's my two cents.  I have been here quite a few times.  It is simply what it is.  Its a good burger.  I have had quite a few different burgers and all have been decent.  I tend to like the whiskey river chicken wrap. Service here is generally good.  It is staffed usually by teenagers.  Take that for what you will.  I have read where other people have had service issues.  I can certainly see it happening, but I haven't experienced it. A decent burger or wrap, not much else to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg?start=40,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
19,Craig H.,"Washington, DC",89,400,1064.0,2.0,2012-03-21,We had a disappointing visit tonight. The big red sign showed a ten minute wait but we easily waited 25 minutes while there were many open tables. No doubt not enough servers on duty. Two of the four ladies working the hostess stand might have been better employed as servers. Hint Mr Manager.  Burger was good once it finally showed up but by then I wish I had stayed home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
51,C R.,"Walkersville, MD",0,43,,2.0,2012-11-18,"Red Robin is NOT yummmm.  Group of 7 ate here on our way to Farm Complex.  No wait; we were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We odered the tower of onion rings, they were just yucky.  Should have been our first clue.  Than we waited over an hour for our food, what would be an hour wait for a burger, and fries?  Finally asked, the waitress; she said it would be out shortly.  It came about 5 min. later.  3 ordered mushroom burgers, all cooked differently.  Not one of them got the burger they ordered, I have a suggestion, put a tooth pick with the doneness marked on it.  2  of us got burgers with endless fries, I got cold, greasy nasty half cooked fries, and the burger was half warm, and nothing special.  Pretty sure they had been sitting on a warming table somewhere.  One of us ordered cheese fries and they arrived at the table when we had almost finished our meal.  Question if you are making endless fries how long would it take to melt some cheese on top of some?  We asked for ranch dressing and mayo.  Still waiting for the ranch dressing.  I am not sure if all Red Robins are like this one; and Yes, we could have asked for new burgers and fries, but like I told the waitress, why should we?  It shoud have been right the first time.  Sure wish we had found a 5 Guys.  Better burgers and fries, faster and cheaper.  I won't bother eating at Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg?start=40,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

Let me begin by saying I have been in the restaurant industry for years and so sometimes I can be a tough critique but this Red Robin was simply on point, everything about it.  I went to this Red Robin on Tuesday night, July 1st around dinner time with 2 other people and we were seated right away. Place wasn't crowded but not dead, either. Ambiance nice. Food was fantastic, especially being a chain restaurant. I just got a veggie burger and even that was the best veggie burger I have ever had. Great sweet potato fries. My boyfriend and his brother had burgers and said they were really great too. Food came out fast. Now the best part was the service. Service was perfect. Good job Red Robin.

27,Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",466,419,4091.0,4.0,2016-03-03,"I have always wanted to go to a Red Robin and try their burgers... I finally got the chance when I took a ride to PA with a friend...Upon entering my hostess was very friendly and immediately seated me... On my table was a mini style upright computer... Great for kids or anyone who likes to play computer games or Trivia... I chose to play trivia while I waited for my food to arrive...( I won both rounds) A nice server by the name of Lucardy handed me a menu, made some suggestions and took my order... I ordered the ROYAL RED ROBIN BURGER. It was a beef burger on a soft bun with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo with a fried easy over egg on top, and melted American cheese... It came with thick cut steak fries... My burger tasted fresh and juicy. The bacon was very crisp, the lettuce and tomato was cool and added a nice touch. The fried egg and melted cheese really made this a burger something to remember... My friend ordered the RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGER. It came with Red's pickle relish, lettuce , tomato, onions,pickles, mayo and American cheese. That too was a nice size juicy burger with lots of toppings.  My server Lucardy brought over a  big bowl of french fries for each of us. It seems Red Robin gives you a choice of unlimited french fries. You can substitute coleslaw, side salad or steamed broccoli for no additional charges.. For a small fee you can sub, Sweet Potato fries, garlic herbed fries, Freckled fruit ( no idea what this is) Mac n cheese, a cup of soup, a cup of chili, onion rings, chili cheese fries,classic mini wedge salad, southwestern black beans, and a GLUTEN FREE BUN.That's great for people who are GLUTEN SENSITIVE..If your really hungry you can add a 2nd patty to your gourmet burger for $1.99... I love that there are so many combinations and choices to choose from. Red Robin also serves Fish, Chicken, Salads and Wraps along with Soup...  If you enjoy beer you can choose from the list that Red Robin recommends with each burger or pick your own.. I chose coffee because I was cold.. My coffee tasted delicious and fresh.. The decor is bright and vivid. The dining room is very large with a bar and old posters and pictures of famous movie stars are up on the walls... When I was finished my server Lucardy showed me how I could use the mini computer on my table to pay my bill.. It was very easy and convenient .. I chose a paper receipt over email and the computer printed it along with giving you percentages to tip from 15 up to 25 range . All I had to do was slide the little bar and  the computer tabulated what that amount would be. Then I hit the one i wanted  and it added that amount to my  bill. I really like this idea and I wish more restaurants would do it so that if you're in a hurry, or on a limited lunch break you don't have to wait for your server, you just eat and go. This Red Robin is in a strip mall. There is plenty of free parking...  I am glad I got the chance to try a Red Robin and will definitely look for another one in my area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.352,2.52

31,Randall G.,"Harrisburg, PA",33,207,445.0,5.0,2016-05-10,"We have frequented this Red Robin location several times over the years and had pretty much stopped in the past few for several reason which no longer apply I'm happy to say !   ;-)  Recently we received a really good promotion via email. This spurned my cheap @ss to nag the other half into giving them a try and going again. Upon entry of RR and also within the menu, I saw no mention of the promotion. As a result, I brought it up on my phone and KINDLY ( remember, it really does go both ways ) asked our waitress if it was honored. Our server pleasantly informed us it was indeed available.  ( I can't remember exactly what the promotion was but it was a REALLY good deal, I do remember that. I would imagine that might have had something to do with the lack of any signage within the menus or table clutter. )  Speaking of which ... We don't go out to dinner to play with a touchscreen & ignore one another. We go out to interact with people & enjoy our meal. Sure, I love my techno-toys and am writing this on an IPad however, a dirty child mangled germ infested touchscreen to amuse jr. @ the table isn't necessary imho.  I was thankful the server took it away when requested without a word or a sales pitch.  Yes, I understand why these are on the tables ( sell add on's & amuse people )but for me, they are certainly not an incentive to spend additional money ... Good service & food are.  If jr. can't be away from the screen long enough to scarf a chicken nugget let M&D bring them a tablet that they already slobbered all over. Seriously, these things are as gross ( aka dirty & germ infested ) as those dumb pagers Panera makes me hold for 5 minutes for a Togo order. Think I'm kidding ? Watch and see how many people don't wash their hands prior to eating yet grab onto these nasty things.  Perhaps you could hand them out as requested instead of plopping them on every table ?  Remember "" Smoking or non smoking "" ?  How 'bout "" Techno toys or not "" ? :-)  I'll play with my iPhone if I absolutely MUST interact digitally while eating.  Our burgers were quickly served and I can say that Red Robin has REALLY improved ! Years ago their quality began to suffer but we were happy to see this neat chain get its act together;-)  Our waitress also allowed us to swap out "" unlimited starch "" aka "" bottomless steak fries "" ... ( Really .. Does anyone GO to RR for this ? As if potatoes are expensive or something anyone truly wants an "" unlimited "" amount of ? ) for a single order of onion rings which were GREAT !  By the way, we gladly offered to pay any up charge that might be associated with a substitution and she graciously declined to allow us to pay more. The food was prepared as ordered and quite flavorful. Condiments ( lettuce, tomatoes, etc ) ALL flavorful & fresh. Meat juicy and cooked AS REQUESTED;-) Our excellent waitress kept our soda glasses full and had a genuine smile on her face which scored her a tip equivalent to more than whatever the amount the promotion saved us. ( I gave her a 20 and I know what I saved was less than that ) for her attitude, professionalism, personality, and HONORING the promotion.  Service goes as far as the food in my opinion and this RR excelled @ both. Thank you for both ! Truly glad to be able to give 5 outta 5 stars and see Red Robin improve ensuring more of our patronage ...

34,Megan T.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",44,1,,1.0,2016-06-06,"On Friday, June 3rd, we took my daughter to celebrate her 12th birthday. I knew Red Robin was one of the places that sang to the customer and stuff for their birthday. We had this planned for 2 weeks. My daughter was super excited, because we usually love Red Robin. Well.... NO MORE!  When we were seated, and our waitress came to take our drink orders, I said ""Today is my daughters birthday."". The waitress said ""Happy Birthday"" in a very I don't care sense and asked what we wanted to drink. We were thrown off by the waitresses attitude. She did not seem like she wanted to be there, and didn't care what anyone thought. Even so, we proceeded to order food, and hype my daughter up for her ""embarrassment"" to come later.  Silverware was dirty. Her father's burger came out with a hair sticking out of it. Sent it back, took FOREVER to get new burger. (My daughter and I were done with our meals by the time his burger came back) The new burger was very undercooked. He asked for no pink, it was very pink. He ate it anyway, because we had a movie to get to in 30 minutes. THEN. We were all done. The waitress came up to ask if we wanted anything else... I asked her if me daughter could have the birthday dessert. She said yeah, and left. I turned to my daughter smiling and told her to get ready. (We had watched 5 other people have their birthdays celebrated as we were there. My daughter counted, shocked at all the people with the same birthday as her.)  Next thing I know, our waitress is back. Places the ice cream sundae in front of my daughter, and..... leaves. Nothing. No Happy Birthday again, no clapping, no singing, no other servers. NOTHING! My daughter was heartbroken. Felt totally rejected. She slowly ate her ice cream, and we left to rush to the movie that we were now later for. Now our one burger was compensated due to the hair, but the manager didn't even tell us that. We only knew when we saw the bill.  So thank Red Robin Employee. Thank you very much for breaking the spirit of my little girl on her birthday.  Nice to know that it was so difficult for you to clap your hands and sing with some other servers. You're a stand up girl. Thanks for ruining a 12 yr old's birthday dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

3,Josh C.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-09,"We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday to find the restaurant barely a third full. The hostesses took a minute or two to decide where we could sit, which felt weird since there was space everywhere. We got to our table and ordered drinks. My freckled lemonade took 10 minutes to come out. After ordering food, we sat and talked for a while. 50 minutes later when the food came, one of the dishes did not come out as ordered and some of the chicken fingers had been dropped on the floor so they had to bring out more food. In the 50 minutes that we were waiting, our server did not come to our table once. We had to go seek out the manager who came to our table at this point to see what she could do about our meals. Finally, the food did come out properly and we all started eating an hour after we sat down. The manager did what she could by taking the one meal off the bill and providing us gift cards but it was still a poor experience.  We have eaten at Red Robin many times and enjoy it usually. The food was the same decent food we were used to. The service was what made this visit terrible. Staff were standing around and sitting at tables and not checking on their tables. The one waitress was sitting with her boyfriend while working.

30,Michael C.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",20,10,2.0,1.0,2016-08-14,"TLDR; Poor server with attitude ruined the experience. My family and I came in around 3pm on Saturday afternoon, and our server was almost immediately very short with us.  She came across as being eager to leave our table as soon as possible. For example, I ordered a virgin daiquiri for my pregnant wife, and asked for poppyseed sauce to come out with our fries. Before I could also ask for bleu cheese, she cut me off by asking my wife what kind of daiquiri she wanted. She immediately left after getting her answer. When she returned, she dropped the drink off at the table and quickly left. We had to call after her after realizing it didn't come with a straw. The drink was topped with a stack of whipped cream, and drinking it without a straw would've been nearly impossible. Our server's interaction with us involved almost no talking. The kitchen staff girl who brought out our main courses out never got the memo on the dipping sauce, and had to go back and get them.  When she returned, she asked if there was anything else we might need. In the span of two minutes, this one kitchen staff member showed us more customer service than our server did the whole meal. At this point, the poor service we were receiving had me curious. I thought maybe our server was having a bad day, but her interactions with everyone else seemed normal. She smiled, laughed, and took time to listen and ask questions. Whatever her issue was, it was clearly with us.  10 minutes later, our server came to check in on us. This is the one single time. We had to flag her down a few minutes later to get a refill on our bottomless fries. Then again a few minutes later to ask for a to-go box. She dropped off a tiny Styrofoam container, then quickly left. Mind you, there were five of us with $60 worth of food. We had to flag her down again to  ask for something bigger. Then again to ask for lids to our dipping sauce. She did a ""drive-by"" that involved dropping the lids off on the table without so much as slowing down. All of this back and forth could have been avoided if she just took a second to listen. We were never rude at any time. We have three kids under three, but they were on model behavior. We weren't loud or demanding, and our children were seated keeping themselves entertained with the crayons and food. Nothing was being thrown about, and nobody was crying. After I packed our boxes, we sat there for around ten minutes waiting on the bill. We wanted to flag her down again, but she kept her distance and never once looked in our direction. I finally stood up, intending to pay at the door, and she comes by and asks ""Have you guys figured out how to pay on the tablet?""  It was at this point that we finally call her out on her poor service. We were in a huge corner booth, and the tablet was a small device hidden at the far end of the table among the drink menu and condiments. We never really paid it much attention, and I assumed it was just for pay-to-play video games. Anyway, after pointing out how poor her service has been the whole entire time, she feigns ignorance and asked us what was so rude about her asking us about the tablet.  We're relatively new to the area, and my Navy job just recently brought us here. We've always loved coming to Red Robin, and it was one of our favorite places to eat in San Diego. Our last city didn't have one, and we were actually pretty excited when we saw that they had a restaurant here. Our very first time eating at this location was just last month when we came down to go house hunting. We received a traditional paper bill, so I know for a fact that these fancy table gadgets are a new thing. Instead of apologizing for her oversight, she double downed on her defense and stated ""Almost every restaurant has these nowadays, I thought you knew what to do."" A quick ""feel free to pay your bill at any time on the tablet"" would have sufficed after she dropped the boxes off.  Basic server etiquette 101. Everyone knows that the bill subject comes up shortly after asking for to-go boxes! My best guess is that we were dumped in her section after we requested a booth, and she wanted everyone to know how much she didn't like it. Or maybe it's something else, I don't know. Whatever issue this lady had with us, she knew exactly what she was doing. She intentionally made it clear she didn't want to serve us. Her behavior was completely normal and upbeat with all of the other patrons, and she seemed experienced. Today wasn't her first day ever being a server. We asked for a manager, who politely listened to a shorter version of this. She apologized and comped a few things by way of gift card. All in all, there were many positive people who work here. Judging by a few of the other reviews on here, there appears to be a small cadre of bad apples that care more about themselves than customer service. They need to do a little housekeeping if they want to keep a loyal customer base.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

22,David H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",108,157,737.0,4.0,2016-10-07,"We have been coming to this Red Robin for at least one of our birthdays each year since we moved to this area 10 years ago. Aside from the free burger for the birthday person, as well we could not resist the lure of bottomless fries.  We've seen the departure of my favorite 5 Alarm Burgers, and the roll-out of the tabletop tablets.  A very kid friendly and fun place to dine.  My son used to crayon some activity sheets while waiting for the order to be served, and pick a balloon in his favorite color as we leave.  There used to be a free birthday sundae in addition to the birthday burger. The prices of the burgers have also gone up over the years.  Still, we continue to love this place.  I celebrated my birthday here again earlier this week. This time I had the Wild West (buffalo) Burger, and my wife had the new Bee's Knees Finest Chicken. My son had the Swirly Twirly Pasta from the kid's menu.  The Wild West Burger was hugely satisfying. The Bee's Knees Chicken was visually stunning. But it's more on the sweet side and the honey made the hands really sticky. We had to run to the restroom to wash our hands because the napkins just did't cut it.  My son loved his Swirly Twirly Pasta.  The service was great this time. Our waitress did everything by the book.  We got our fries right away as we waited for our burgers. Drinks were refilled.  My son even got his pasta ""refilled""!!!  That was a surprise!!  In the end, our waitress even offered to give us a box for the leftovers.  Needless to say, we gave her fat tips for her impeccable service. We will continue to celebrate birthdays at Red Robin, that's for sure!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

24,Ryan D.,"New Cumberland, PA",0,33,,1.0,2017-03-08,"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! Ill preface this by saying, I love Red Robin, always had amazing dinners with the family. But honestly, NEVER GOING BACK! I went in with wife and 15 month old for a 7:30pm dinner on a Wednesday, very slow, got a table right away! Cool I thought, should be a quick, easy experience. Wrong.  Server greeted us after what seemed a bit longer than usual, but we are easy going, and we thought nothing of it. We gave her our orders, AND THIS WAS BASICALLY THE LAST TIME WE SAW HER. -Food runner brought our food -Server never checked on us -Manager never table touched us -We paid via Ziosk on table She finally came back while we were putting on our coats and getting ready to head for the doors, at this moment she asked us if we ""wanted more drinks or fries"", HAHA, really?! We sat there for 20 mins with empty glasses, empty baskets and you ask now? With coats on? What made it worse was a few factors.  1. We ordered poorly for our little guy, and I was going to order something else for him as he was being a little more discontent that normal. But she never came back, so me and the wife took turns walking him around the restaurant while the other ate.  2. While walking around the very empty restaurant, I noticed the entire time we sat with empty glasses and for myself atleast empty fries, as it was the only thing my son would eat as the ""healthier"" option we had gotten him was not to his liking, our server was doing nothing more than rolling silverwear.  Look, Ive worked in restaurants my whole life, I appreciate people are not always at their best, and that down times can be especially hard to motivate ones self. But this was THE WORST case of table neglect Ive ever seen, experienced, been around etc.  I tipped the lady 17% (which is an absolute TERRIBLE tip from me), as I RARELY tip less than 20% and usually tip about 30%. So I still took care of her to some degree, but she probably is completely oblivious to how terrible of an experience that really was for myself, my wife and especially my toddler who ate so little and was never afforded the option of ordering something else.  I took the Survey on the Ziosk letting Red Robin know how displeased I was, as well as the Survey they email to you to elaborate on your experience. I have received replies to NEITHER! So obviously those surveys MEAN NOTHING. I was going to wait to not post these on social media if they had gotten back to me, but obviously they dont care, so I dont care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mechanicsburg,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

Our server was very slow and not knowledgeable about the gluten free menu. (I am and knew more than he did).  Doesn't even know that honey mustard dressing is in fact GF. He proceeds to come back and tell us they are out of HM dressing.. like WTF?? Your most popular item? Okay order food. Comes out cold with a burnt GF bun.. (not his fault). Fries are mushy and cold. Manager stops by. Concerns given, she brings new fries. And says I will discount your meals. 10% you big discounter.. waiter has been MIA most of the time.

So you know from the get-go that quality and customer satisfaction take a back seat to corporate regulations. Plus, everytime I come here I never get served any more french fries than the paltry first serving, even though they're supposed to be ""neverending"". Once we asked the waiter three separate times over the course of our meal for more fries but we never got them. It's almost as if the wait staff is told specifically not to fulfill the extra orders of french fries. I'll come back with the folks since they like the familiarity. But I'll never pay a dime out of my own pocket for this quality of food and service. A better local alternative is Black and Bleu down the Carlisle Pike. Fresher food and a more authentic experience.

She started off our visit badly and therefore ruined anything good that happened afterwards. She did not greet us, and never even smiled. As she walked us across the empty resturaunt my friend commented about taking us so far when the place was empty. She than put the menus on the table and in a snotty voice said, ""well here you go"". When my husband and my friends husband came back, we realized how small and uncomfortable the booth was, so we moved down a few booths. The waitress, Natalie was very sweet and understood and told us it was no problem. Here's where it took everything I had not to say something to the hostess. When she saw that we had moved, she gave us a dirty look and than proceeded to go up to our waitress and talk about us. I could not believe her, no customer service skills, I mean come on if you're going to talk about a customer at least do it where they can't see you. I have to say though, our waitress was super sweet and you could tell she was trying to make up for Rachel the bad hostess. The food was consistent with Red Robin's quality.

21,Amy G.,"Hampden, PA",122,387,25.0,1.0,2017-10-06,"So much potential. So much failure. My hamburger loving son wanted to go here to celebrate the night before his birthday. When we arrived, the hostess took our name and said it would be a 15-20 minutes wait. I looked around the restaurant and saw lots of empty tables and tons of staff. I asked why there was a wait with so many tables open, she said something about not wanting to seat her servers twice (whatever that means). We finally get seated, after a while, and we are put at a booth next to the back walkway between the dining area and the bar. It smells like bleach - I assume from whatever they use to clean things. Yuck. Blech. Stinky. We waited about 30 minutes until someone stopped at our table. After watching staff pass our table again and again (because everyone was going to the bar on a frequent basis) some guy finally realized we had been sitting there for half an hour without any drinks. He's not our server, but offers to get us something to drink. Our server stops by and seems surprised to see us there. She offers to take our drink orders but we tell her someone was already getting them. We put in our orders and wait. The only positive of the night was when our server asked if we'd be wanting fry refills. When we said yes, she said she'd go ahead and put in an order for two refills so they'd be ready. Food was decent. Burgers were decent. Fries were decent. Unfortunately, nobody cleared our plates. So, we sat there with empty plates, baskets, napkins, empty drink glasses, etc. Hubby was about to walk them to the table next to us (which had been empty for about 15 minutes and still hadn't been cleared) just to get some space. Our server came back to ask if our son wanted a birthday sundae. She brought one out, starting to melt. She looked sheepish when she said she hadn't been able to round up any servers to sing to him. I told her it was OK. Then, about 4 minutes later, a bunch of them sang to someone on the other side of the restaurant. We weren't the only victims. I saw a woman on the other side of the restaurant actually walk to the kitchen entrance, looking exasperated, to ask for something. For the price, particularly with tons of staff milling around, I expected much better service. MUCH BETTER! If someone from corporate sees this, it was the worse Red Robin experience I've ever had.

Most of the time the service was getting more fries. The bottom always comes early. So to get around this I ask for the extra fries up front. That worked the next two visits. Yesterdays visit was it. I will no longer go to RR. We get there, wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. Place our order, ask for the extra fries. Waiter comes out with oir drinks but no straws. Have to flag him down for that. Then 10 minutes later he stops by and we tell him we didn't get the fries. He comes back with an order for each of us. Mine was the size of a kids portion and my brother's was about two portions. Then came the burgers. I got the big pig out and he asked for a bacon cheeseburger. Half way in my brother asks what's on mine, and he said thats the same thats on his, so ourquestion is are they the same? Whats the difference? Anyway, waiter brings out another order of fries then like 5 minutes latter another, different waitress comes out with more. But thats the service part, now for the quality of the burger. As I said, previos visits the burger(same  order each time) was pretty good. This time I picked it up and a flood of grease oozed out. The bottom part of the bun was so saturated it was limp and falling. Needless to say I didn't finish it. But it was the gift that kept on giving...spent the rest of the afternoon on the toilet.
