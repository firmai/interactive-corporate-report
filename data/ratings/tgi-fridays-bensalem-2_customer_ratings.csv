98,Stephanie N.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,,1.0,2012-10-13,"I went here with my dad and it was a bad experience. It took ten min just to seat us and the place wasn't packed. After seating us, two waitresses came over because one was new and didn't know what to do. They took our orders but took forever to understand exactly what we wanted, we didn't even want anything complicated. The one waitress just couldnt understand the other, wtf. My dad ordered pasta that originally comes with chicken, but he doesnt eat meat so he asked for extra pasta instead of the chicken. I ordered moterzalla sticks and chicken fingers. His pasta was small and looked no where near like they had put extra pasta in it. So bascically we paid for a full dish but only got half. The moterzalla sticks were nasty, and tasted cold. The chicken fingers tasted horrible, like they weren't cooked all the way. We had also gotten fries that were cold. The waitresses didn't come back at all to check up on us, we had to flag them down to get our check. It was expensive for no reason,the food and service sucked. Don't bother eating here, you won't finish your food because of how cold it is, and you'll waste your money for nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

Because of the traffic I was in a crappy mood, so I came in with an edge. Anyway, I sat at the bar and got waited on right away - service was great.  Then I ordered the burger with the Jack Daniel's sauce - woah that stuff is good.  The burger itself is nothing special, however, the Jack Daniel's sauce is what makes it.  After all - it's a chain restaurant burger.  Long story short - it was a solid experience and for the top service I gotta give it 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

On March 13th 2015 my boy-friend and I decided to come to this establishment to celebrate his graduation night and all of his recent achievements. Before placing our appetizers my friend had ordered a House Long Island Ice Tea (LIIT). As our waitres brought out the appetizer my friend had ordered another LIIT. After sharing a few appetizers our entrees came out and that's when my friend had ordered another LIIT. Towards the end of our meal and before wanting to order desert our waitress had asked us if we needed anything else and my friend asked for another LIIT and she softly said let me ask if they will ""let"" you have another one, confused she walked away and within' a few minutes a man I'm assuming was the manager came with the check and asked us if we needed anything else.  We proceeded and told him that we had asked our waitess for another LIIT and didn't know what the problem was...and he proceeded to say how he couldn't serve us any more drinks due to the amount we have already ordered and left.  Now, being a business owner myself I understand that ""if"" there were a 3 limit drink in the companies policy then their decision this night is understandable. But that wasn't the case. If my friend had acted ill mannered due to his alcohol consumption such as speaking sluggish, not being able to walk or stand I would understand that limiting his drinks is in his best intrest but again that definitely wasn't the case. We are adults and would like to be treated with the respect that we are responsible enough to know our limits.  If there were any concern for my friend and his alcohol consumption they could of approached us more professionally. Such as, asking if my friend was driving or if he was okay. But both the waitress and manager fail to do so.  Overall, I feel very upset over this situation and will be taking it to corporate.

Instead some other staff member talked to someone else on the phone right in front of 4 waiting guests.  #2: we waited 20 minutes outside for a table when there were maybe 1/4 open tables in the place. We did overhear an explanation from a hostess to another group of annoyed guests that they had a no-show and their manager couldn't make it in. Kind of crazy that two missing staff members would cripple a TGI Friday's on a Friday... #3: we were then seated and waited another 20 minutes while not 1 but 2 parties, one of four and one of eight, were both seated, greeted, and had their drinks brought to them while we sat completely forgotten by any staff.

16,Tom G.,"Churchville, PA",1,6,6.0,1.0,2016-06-22,"We were returning from a day in Philadelphia to our homes in Buck county. It was dinner time so we agreed to look for a place to eat. We passed up a few other restaurants that had long wait times to be seated.  We spotted a TGIF Fridays and quickly decided to stop for a bite. To our parties amazement, we were quickly seated, and that's when the experience started to go downhill. The table was sticky and on further inspection so was the floor. Evidently an earlier patron spilled their beer. While gazing at the sticky stains I sized up the general cleanliness of my surroundings.  It looked as if they had not swept or washed the floors for who knows when. Trash and various pieces and parts off of the bussed plates were everywhere.  The waitress was obviously overworked and unsmiling.  She took our drink orders and reappeared in what seemed like 10-15 minutes. While waiting for her to return with our beverages, we collectively had ample time to take in the menu. I'll admit that it's been a while since I last visited a TGIF's... but WOW the prices were outrageous. This is definitely NOT a fine dining restaurant. We finally settled on some of the apps and smaller portion dinner entries.  The four of us were equally disappointed with the quality of our offerings, Which ranged from the Jack-sliders to the Chipotle Yucatan chicken salad, and two of the Bruschetta chicken pasta. The sliders contained questionable (mystery )meat and were over cooked. The salad was dry and flavorless, the chicken desert dry. The pasta was undercooked as well. If you spot a TGIF Friday's run, don't walk, as fast as your little legs can take you, in a direction far, far away from this nightmare.  You may thank God that it's Friday... you'll thank yourself for passing on this insult to dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.4440000000000002,1.96

The service wasn't any better.  There was a special on a certain draft beer - making it the same price for two sizes of the beer.  The waitress brought us out the smaller size, twice, and told us that it was okay because it was the same price (even though we were getting a smaller glass).

Every person would be charged $10 if they didn't get a meal ($40) even though we were only getting two apps ($20 value).

Lastly, there were new servers there on our last two visits.

They used to have a great menu, packed with diverse meals.  Their portions used to be huge.  The staff used to be energetic, friendly, and eager to please.  The food used to be served promptly and brought to your table at the same time so everyone could eat their meals together. Sadly, ""used to be"" is the key phrase here. My family and I came here for dinner a few days ago.  From the moment we sat down to when we walked out the door we were shaking our heads.  In summary: I asked for a large beer.  Got a small glass of beer.  Ordered French onion soups.  Got bowls of someone's ""interpretation"" of French onion soup instead.  Namely, a small bowl of cold broth with a piece of cheese covered bread floating in it.  My family were served theirs, while I waited about five minutes for mine to eventually arrive.  My daughter's salad? Arrived few minutes after that.  Also, soups were brought with teaspoons, not soup spoons. Meals also arrived one at a time, many minutes apart.  All the while, we watched the wait staff standing around, talking to each other.  Most were giggling with one another, occasionally hugging one another like they were at a party or something.  They seemed ""put upon"" to go and take care of their tables. Our waitress? Never even asked us if we wanted dessert.  Or refills for our drinks.  Or if our we were happy with our meals.  She was VERY quick to bring us the check and get our payment though.  No doubt she was eager to get back to her conversation with another waitress she was chatting with by the kitchen entrance.  Shame on us for pulling her away! The only really positive part of the whole experience was watching the menagerie of staff when they managed to break away from their conversations and actually go take orders or serve food.  We gave them all names as they passed our table.  Here's a few: ""Tattoo Arm,"" ""Nose Ring,"" ""Hugs a Lot,"" ""Laughs too Much,"" ""Barely Legal,"" and ""Almost Dropped Everything.""

When confronted with this fact, the make host made zero accommodations to try to fit us in and told us we would have to wait until the next day was available... On a Saturday night at 7pm.

55,Staci F.,"Ringtown, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-29,"For starters, I want to make it clear that I love TGI Fridays as a whole- I've been to several and have pretty much always enjoyed myself. With that being said, this is by far the worst TGI I've ever stepped foot in. I travel a lot for work and often stay in hotels so I'm always looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price. It wasn't incredibly busy- a semi-full restaurant on a Wednesday night. I asked for a seat at the bar and was told to seat myself but when I went up the bar was full. I walked back to the hostess and asked her for a table instead since there was no room at the bar and she told me I'd have to wait as she stood waiting to seat the couple that was walking up to the restaurant from outside. So I stood another 5 minutes waiting to be seated at any one of many open tables. Still not a big deal, until I sat at my table for 15 minutes before anyone approached me to take my drink order. When my waitress came up she was fairly rude, she just walked up to my table and stared at me without saying anything. Taking the hint that I wasnt even going to get a ""hello"" I went ahead and gave her my drink order and my food order for the Endless Apps right away. I then waited another 20 minutes for my drink as I sat eating my food. None of this would have been an issue if it weren't for the fact that 1) the weren't very busy as previously stated and 2) i watched my waitress stand around talking to coworkers with her back turned to me. Very glad I found this location through my travels because I would never come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=40,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

I went here many times over the years, and had about a 5 year hiatus since this last visit. I'll stick to the facts- but everything they did (or didn't do) seemed to top the last disappointing thing.  We were sat right away, which was the only positive. We ordered a French onion soup to start, and a Bloody Mary. Both took well over 20 minutes. The soup, I can understand. The drink- the waitress had in her hand while chatting casually for 5+ minutes before dropping off to our table! Watered down by that point. The onion soup was embarrassing. No crusty cheese, just broth. We thought it was an error! But, no, they assured us this was their normal presentation. Cannot comment on taste as it was not appetizing enough to try. Skip to salad. Our salads not only came with wrong ingredients (red onions instead of green- big breath difference). Asked for tomatoes and got two measly cherry tomatoes. Also- dressing on the side? Never came! Told the waiter immediately upon delivery who apologized and said he would grab it. Fast forward 10 min, still no sight of waiter. I physically had to find a random worker to get our dressing.

This employee snapped back about not clocking in for another few minutes. The hostess left with the other couple without saying anything back. But then the unprofessional one stood up, coughed all over without covering her mouth, and took us to a table anyway. I didn't even want to touch the menus at that point. A waitress came over promptly and was nice enough, but when we asked for another minute, she took 10 before returning. The food took forever, and arrived lukewarm at best. My husband's fries were cold. The 'crispy Brussels sprouts' I ordered were really salty and pretty much inedible. What I presume was cheese in my mashed potatoes had also started to solidify due to not being hot.  Our waitress had checked on us before we'd really gotten a bite in, so we didn't realize just how off the meal was. And then she vanished again. I had to wave her down from across the room for the check. At that point, we didn't want to wait 20 min for her to find a manager. The meal had already taken way longer than it should have. Ironically, we just got a $50 gift card to Fridays this week, and we don't even want to use it. That's how poor an impression this place has left on us. We're just going to give it away.
