15,E S.,"Craryville, NY",8,1,,4.0,2012-04-12,"I just went for lunch, all you can eat soup and salad. ..Great food, Great value, Great service...I recommend all should try this restaurant for a good lunch.  The staff was very friendly, the manager came by our table several times to make sure all was well.  We tried several combinations of different soups and salads...spinich and shrimp good and fresh, they even substituted broiled chiken for the fried option...very accomodating.  We will go back, I hope it will be as satisfying...Two ate for 28 dollars with a very generous tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
6,Amanda S.,"Albany, NY",21,155,7.0,4.0,2013-07-24,"Please note that I am giving this 4 stars for a chain restaurant (compared to a joint that would provide homemade meals, Applebees wouldn't come close). I've only ever gotten food to go at this particular Applebees, but I've always had a pleasant experience. The people who answer the phone have been consistently friendly and helpful, not to mention patient because I'm typically calling in orders for a at least a couple of my coworkers. They are quick to get to the vehicle and are just as friendly in person as they are on the phone. The food at Applebees is just about the same as any chain restaurant. Nothing exceptional, though definitely good. They have recently added a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich. What a great combination of foods!! It is SO good! Very tasty and fresh. The French fries are delicious, I'm not sure what kind of spices are put on them, but whatever they are, they're really good. The three cheese penne pasta is good, not great. The pasta is usually a teeeeeny bit overcooked, but the chicken is always good. This meal is sometimes served with a breadstick and sometimes not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
12,Jim H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,58,,1.0,2013-08-26,"The food here (at least what I ordered) was disgusting even by the low standards of Applebees; the service was equally deplorable,,waited almost 15 minutes for an iced tea, followed by a really inedible onion soup (even smelled bad) and their ""signature"" chicken fiesta salad (about 2/3rd of a cup mostly iceberg lettuce) and an equally inedible breadstik...yikes, with all the good restaurants in Hudson what was I thinking?   My excuse was I had auto work done nearby and was clealy hungry, but even starving I wold be hard pressed to eat this as lunch,,,this goes under ""never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
7,Stephanie F.,"Cairo, NY",0,18,3.0,1.0,2014-12-26,"Highly insulting place to eat. Server calls the hostess a ""nigger' in front of customers and a manager. We went to give hostess a gift for the holiday to find out she was fired! Didn't know Applebee's supports racism, hate and name calling. We will never eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
13,Shaun S.,"Hudson, NY",0,1,1.0,1.0,2015-01-22,Service declines with every visit. Walked in at 8:30 PM to completely filthy restaurant. All tables were covered with previous guests food and dishes. There were approx 15 tables with customers and two of the tables had to ask for silverware at the time there food was delivered to the table. We waited 20 min as wait staff walked by us as we sat in a section that only had one other table with guests. We decided to get up and walk out once the waitress decided to clear the tables around us and fail to acknowledge our presence. Unfortunately I must admit we will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
10,Hannah S.,"Catskill, NY",118,1,,1.0,2015-02-26,"This is the first review I have ever written. Though I use services like Yelp! and TripAdvisor often, I've never had the urge to broadcast my experiences across the internet until now.  When our ""neighborhood Applebee's"" opened up everyone was ecstatic. At first, the food was great, service was quick and friendly and it quickly became a popular weeknight dinner stop for many locals. I myself would frequent the restaurant once or twice a week. HUGE fan of the Sangritas and pretzel sticks. How you've managed to turn what was originally a highly promising venture in a great location that should have quickly become a success story, into the shithole sorry excuse for a corporate chain restaurant has completely mindfucked me. No one goes into a restaurant like Applebee's expecting 5 Star food. What we do expect, however, is not to be greeted by a hostess who looks like she would be just as comfortable offering a blowjob as a table. The giant band-aid covering a giant hickey that looks like it was left by an industrial vacuum. Customers walk in, and are greeted by this woman, well, not greeted really because shes too busy flirting with another customer to do anything more than glance your way until she feels like acknowledging you. When your finally worthy of being sat, you're paraded though tables laden with past meals that everyone is apparently too busy to clean off. So they stay dirty. Literally, for hours.    The food, which is mostly microwaved take FOREVER. I'm talking 35 minutes for pretzels. Drinks, which are promptly made by the bartenders who actually seem to be the only facet that has their shit together, just sit on the bar until the servers are done flirting with each other and talking bullshit. 20 minutes for a drink that I can see was done in 5. I waited 25 mins for a steak that came out cold. There was a hair in my mashed potatoes that my waitress just picked out and brought back to me. One time I received a completely different burger than what I ordered and when I brought it to the attention of my waitress (who I had to wait 20 mins to get a glimpse of) she said, ""that's so weird, I'm sorry"" and disappeared into the back for another 20 mins.  I've consistently revisited occasionally because I'm really hoping that someone starts caring and I can actually enjoy eating here again. As I said,  I'm really not one to complain, but someone needs to say something because this is really REALLY bad. I'm not quite sure who died and left this establishment in the hands of what I'm assuming must be either a complete and total moron, or someone who thinks that their job is a total and complete joke. I'm very surprised that higher ups haven't picked up on the complete loss that this once promising location was. Unfortunately, I think we're left with only one option: Burn Hudson Applebee's to the ground, and give us a TGIFridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
11,David V.,"Morenci, AZ",0,12,1.0,1.0,2015-06-29,"This is not the most up to it Applebee's when I first walked in I was stared at like a criminal. I am not from the area and look nothing like anyone else. Guess Hispanic and native Americans shouldn't come here. Feel very racist at this location. After a few weird moments the hostess says ""just 1"" I say yes and get directed to a table. I looked over the menu and figured out what I wanted and then waited for a good 15 minutes, and the place is extremely slow, for the waiter to come he gets here and I ask for sweet tea which they don't have. So I get unsweet and add sugar which didn't work I added about 30 packets and it wouldn't turn sweet like a sugar monster kept stealing it. It was so old that it wouldn't take sugar. So I got water can't go wrong there. I then place my order and what do you know the ribs are cold so I go to the fries and what else cold, at this point I just deal with it and eat it. I finish my cold meal and then the waiter comes back and asks if I want dessert so I had to decline. I did ask for another glass of water and got that. The best part of the whole visit the water. Plus I got charged for the nasty tea that was very old. This place is sad a call to the cooperate office is in order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
9,Cavan K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,29,,2.0,2015-09-27,"The service and food here is inconsistent at best. There is a constant ebb and flow of managers and supervisors -- some who haven't a clue about restaurant management. My gf and I have witnessed fights from the kitchen spilling out to the bar's service area. Service is much better at the bar but, if it's crowded, the bartender is overworked, often without a temp back up. Corporate really needs to step in and solve these major issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
8,Patricia S.,"Hyde Park, NY",0,9,,1.0,2016-05-07,"Went to Applebee's in Hudson my today to have a steak and play a couple games of quick draw... Usually stop there before shopping for a decent meal... Well I was given a menu and that was it... Several servers walked by me...several servers talking by front entrance ... No sevice... I work in the food and beverage industry and could not believe I was never acknowledge... So another restaurant got my business and money... Needless to say I wll not return... I always liked having a bite to eat there, but will not return...hope you find more attentive staff in the future... If it were busy I could understand but to watch these servers talking to each other and not giving service sucks!!! Sincerely. A customer that will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,

3,Jeffrey A.,"Hudson, NY",2,11,1.0,1.0,2016-05-22,"Two strikes you're out. We were seated and orders taken. Sunday afternoon and only 20% full. After waiting for 15 minutes wAitress says kitchen changed so orders did not get in. I ask where are drinks? She says sorry, right away. 10 more minutes the drinks arrive. 10 more and salads arrive. Silverware in 5 more but DIRTY. I complained. They brought another set DIRTY blaming dishwasher. 5 more minutes manager comes by and I explain. He says sorry I'll be right back with clean silver. 10 minutes and nothing. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
4,Sue R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,10,,1.0,2016-08-06,"One of the worst Applebee's locations. Slow service, uninterested hostess, manager and waitstaff, and dirty glasses and silverware. I keep giving them chances, thinking I'm visiting at an ""off"" time, but these guys can't get anything right even when it's slow. Orders are screwed up, tables sit uncleared for 30 minutes, and servers walk around seemingly oblivious and unwilling to correct issues. You'll have a better experience at the Taco Bell nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hudson-7,,,,,
