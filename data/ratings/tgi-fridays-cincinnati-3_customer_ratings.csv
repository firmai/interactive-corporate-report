After the freezing experience at MLT, this was a nice closing to the night. Beth and Erin are regulars here so the bartender knew there order before they sat down. Being the driver i just had tea.  There was a little wait for a table, but not to bad, We sat at the bar and had a few empty seats, after 8:30 it really opened up at the bar. I've never eaten at a fridays before but after looking and smelling what crossed my path, this is now of the list to try.

We dropped in spontaneously at this location for a late dinner one night, and we were reasonably happy with our service. It was a slow night for them apparently, so service had the opportunity to be top notch. We had no complaint with our food - the food was properly prepared, tasty, and fast. No real complaint with the server either - it just was not an outstanding experience.

Go for the chicken instead. The service, on the other hand, has always been fantastic. I hate going to a place and having to spend any amount of time dealing with bad service, so I enjoy coming here, where I can always expect people to be friendly and competent. The rotating tap at the bar is pretty solid and I think they go out of their way to find some decent craft beers to offer. In the past I've had Stone IPA, Bell's Oberon, Bell's Two-Hearted, and Great Lakes Christmas Ale. The selection is unique to this Friday's and is better than I would expect from a chain restaurant.  This is an acceptable place to go have a beer and a sandwich. Very middle-of-the-road, but you're unlikely to have an awkward and unenjoyable experience there. You'll probably have a decent time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

However the apps aren't as unlimited as we thought or all that great. They have a certain selection of apps to choose from (which is pretty understandable) the part that I didn't really like is once you pick one you have to stick with it you can't change it up even tho they are all the same price. Also the are ""unshareable"" unless everyone at your table gets an unlimited app. I got the spicy chicken tostada which was decent but nothing to go back for and J got the sriracha load potato skins which neither of us were fond of. The chicken had a weird taste to it, it wasn't spicy, and it was practically all potato.  However I did find a good gluten free beer while we were there called omission that would probably be the only thing I get again.

I then asked the manager to please switch us to another section and server - she did that. The food order was completely wrong.

35,Amy C.,"Cincinnati, OH",261,130,140.0,2.0,2015-07-16,"The one thing I associate with TGI Friday's are their iconic, delicious potato skins. Not anymore. I'd seen the ""new"" version on commercials and wondered if the taste was as good...um, no. They're dry, freezer-burnt, have a Cheez Whiz like substance on them versus real, gooey, melted cheese & basically are inedible. I cannot understand why the chain would make this switch. The frozen type you can buy at the grocery store & bake at home taste fresher & have a better texture. I sent the ones on our appetizer sampler platter back, in hopes of better, ""fresher"" ones, but they were the same in taste & dry, old texture. We did try the new French onion soup wontons in the app sampler & they had great flavor; however the next week I saw commercials about this new app & they were covered in Swiss cheese. Mine didn't come with cheese at all. My husband loved the wings (also on the sampler) and his chicken skewer/rice dinner. Unfortunately, our appetizer & entrees arrived at the same time with everything lukewarm at best & his dinner without sauce. My French dip sandwich was good, flavorful & the fries well seasoned, though only barely warm. It was annoying to me to have a ton of food at one time & not much was hot, especially when I was really hungry & wanted to pace out what I was eating. This was a second try back at the location after ordering the exact same sandwich a year ago in which it was brought incorrectly to me twice. First with horseradish (can't really scrape that off), then ice cold. My very pregnant, starving friend had completely finished her app & sandwich by the third time I was served my lunch correctly. During this time, the manager came up oblivious after wrong/cold sandwich 2 & attempted to do a super quick, ""Everything's great here, right?"", which in itself isn't looking very proactively to help. Friday's used to be so much more. Such a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

Based on a number of visits to this Fridays, we've found that service is always very good, the restaurant is always very clean and the food is generally good.  On this visit, my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with breaded shrimp combo and I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with the crispy shrimp combo.  The ribs, chicken and breaded shrimp with all very good.  The crispy shrimp, on the other hand, were indeed crispy but not all that good.  A little too crispy and a little too skimpy size-wise.  The weather was great and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio.

29,Jay S.,"Indianapolis, IN",40,70,16.0,3.0,2017-02-21,"3 stars is generous, I feel. The only thing that brings me back ever is the Jack Daniels sauce for various menu items and the fact that the kiddo loves their chicken strips. I don't expect top notch service when I dine here, but things like refills, checking back, and accuracy are things I do expect. None of those were done when we dined here Monday. I feel like Friday's is one of those chain restaurants that will be shut down sooner than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
30,Tawnia L.,"Cincinnati, OH",27,7,2.0,1.0,2017-03-05,"This location is a complete and total joke. We arrived at 6:50 for a 7:00 reservation. In fairness I was told that we would be seated closer to 7. This is not an exaggeration when I say that nearly 3/4 of the tables were empty.  At 7:05 i asked when our table would be ready and I was told that it would be another 20-25 minutes. Are you kidding me? Had I been told this 15 minutes earlier I would have left. Clearly bad management! You should be full and turning over every table; that's how you make money. I'm going to guess that TGI Friday's will fall doom just as other ""once upon a time"" popular restaurants are folding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
38,Mark W.,"Milford, OH",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-03,"Extremely slow service, incorrect orders, a careless waitstaff and just dirty.  TGI Fridays used to be a good place to go for lunch or dinner, but it has gone downhill.   I don't expect them to be around much longer at this pace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

27,Hailey W.,"Mason, OH",37,18,9.0,1.0,2017-07-06,It was 40 minutes before close and we tried to call in take out they told us they don't do it this late so we drove to location to eat in. They mostly seemed annoyed it was 20 min before close. They then tell us kitchen closes in 10 minutes and last call is in 20 I order one drink and she comes back 3 minutes later telling me last calls actually now  as well as the kitchen closing this is at 11:45 they close at 12:00. so if I want any other drinks to tell her now. They rushed us and it was very rude and unprofessional. The drink I did order  tasted like syrup and not alcohol the other drink tasted like how sunscreen smells. My boyfriend got a water and they didn't fill it up the whole time we were there.  Then when the check out and out comes a different server. On top all that the manager was walking around is street clothes on her phone.  On top of that are potatoes skins were a joke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
26,Zaria D.,"Cincinnati, OH",56,107,98.0,4.0,2017-08-30,"I went in for lunch. The hostess appeared to be new and uneasy. She sat me at a wet table. My waitress, Andrea, came and wiped out down while she greeted me. She was very friendly. Since I have the rewards card she immediately ordered my chips and salsa and drink. She then gave me the time needed to place order for meal. I had the sizzling chicken and cheese which is one of my favorites. It came out just as I finished my chips and salsa. The pan was so hot that all the cheese was burnt so just had chicken and potatos. The chicken was good just like the cheese with the meal. I also order the strawberry lemonade. It was not as favorful as I would have liked but I made it work. Also ordered chicken and shrimp cajun pasta to go which was good for the person trying it.  It was a good experience. Andrea was very good with following up and providing good customer service. The food could have been better but overall it was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
