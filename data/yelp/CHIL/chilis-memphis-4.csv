Fred G.,"Glenview, IL",3,90,1,3.0,2/6/2012,"This is the typical Chili's. Our service was good, the food was good.  The atmosphere is that of a suburban family restaurant - so the noise level was pretty high and there were a handful of kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=40
JR S.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,9/27/2014,"9:45 Sat nite. Ordered medium steak. Delivered very well done. Asked for replacement, it came the VERY same way. Mgr came both times. Gave up and left for ice cream. Oh, and they shook pepper over the whole plate of food and I asked them not to do that on the 2nd plate, but they did",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=40
Chris G.,"Memphis, TN",3,161,11,2.0,3/12/2014,"I find the seating and the service at this location to be slow and unfocused.  It also appears to be more run-down than the other Chili's that I have visited.   With its sparkly East Memphis location, I find  the ""ghetto"" vibe here really surprising.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=40
Wayne R.,"Memphis, TN",27,144,41,4.0,1/19/2013,"You can never go wrong eating at Chili's.  I usually order the 2 for 20 deal, that also comes with an entree.  Their food selection is variable, and they give you plenty of it.  Be careful though; if you order to-go, some of your food may turn out cold.  My girlfriend's Talapia was a little cold when we got home to eat.  Every other time, though, Chili's has been on point!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=40

Kevin W.,"Euless, TX",692,570,464,3.0,10/23/2016,This is a chain restaurant and it is not special. The good is that they have some very affordable options. My dad and I split a 2 for $25 deal where we both got entrees and we split an appetizer. It was too much food for either of us to finish.  We split the Texas loaded cheese fries. The fries were extremely salty. It took forever to get some extra ranch but the food was edible. The chicken crispers are my favorite. I thought they could have been better but I the portions were large. Come here for happy hour or when you are low on funds.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4
Madison L.,"Cordova, TN",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Placed a to-go order online where the estimated wait time was 24 minutes, arrived at the store about 20 minutes after placing the order and proceeded to wait an additional 30 minutes for the order. The pasta I ordered was ice cold after the ten minute drive home. The store was dirty, trash on the floor, tables needed bussing. Had to step over a pile of trash swept into the middle of the floor and left there. I don't expect much from chilis but if your lobby is that disgusting, I wonder what the kitchen looks like. Will never be returning to this location, save your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4
Carolyn D.,"Memphis, TN",0,21,,1.0,9/14/2017,"Yes, I think so. I am rating this restaurant for one reason. I was taken for about $1.00 on a gift card, just found out today when I visited a Chili's in Oxford, MS today. This is what happened, I went to Chili's at 4609 Poplar in early August 2017 and ordered a take-out meal. The waitress came brought me a menu then left and came back for my order over 15 minutes later. My order was less than $10. I paid for the order, about 20 minutes after I ordered, I paid with a $10.00 gift card. The waitress took my card and left the ticket and the gift card for me to sign. I  drew a line through the tip line wrote the total and signed. I did not leave a tip and did not give this lady permission to take my change on the card. She did not deserve a tip. She kept me waiting too long for a takeout order. I was not willing to give her a tip. So she stole my balance on the gift card. The card never expires, therefore when I was told today that the Chili's gift card was zero balance, I immediately knew what had occurred. Shame on this thief. If I wanted her to have a tip, I would have given her a tip. You just can't trust some of the people at this restaurant. Watch out for your gift cards and credit cards. I have heard stories about crooked workers at east Memphis restaurants stealing off customers credit cards. SHAMEFUL!!! I ordered ribs and the meal was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4
Leonor-Lee G.,"Raeford, NC",45,8,,5.0,4/19/2017,"We loved this place.  I had only been to a Chili once in my city area which is Fayetteville, NC.  We were in Memphis to visit Graceland.  I can't say enough nice things about this place and the waitress.  The grilled chicken salad was outstanding.  The food came pretty quickly and the waitress was very, very nice.  As a result we are going to our Chili's in Fayetteville tomorrow because I was with my grown son in Memphis and I want to take my husband to enjoy now.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4

Jerica B.,"Memphis, TN",259,21,11,3.0,9/10/2016,"I received a gift card from my manager for helping out with extra duties at work, and I took my kiddo. Otherwise, I would probably not come here, and I actually would have gone to On the Border or Macaroni Grill, just thought this was more kid-friendly.  Our server was super sweet, but overwhelmed, though I felt like she probably did her best. She forgot my kid's chocolate milk, so he received it AFTER we finished eating.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food to come out, so we were too hungry to even consider sending anything back. The cooks browned my kid's cheese pizza to the point where, if you did this at home, you'd growl at yourself, then scowl while eating it, and sigh heavily after deciding to throw the rest of it out and order some Papa John's instead. He felt the need to put KETCHUP on it to even consider eating any of it. He ordered mashed potatoes as his side (yeah, weird, I know), and, again, put KETCHUP in the taters to mask the odd taste. I tried it, and even though I liked it, it didn't seem to be made for a kid, had garlic or something in it...or it was old. I really couldn't tell. I ordered the Classic Bacon Cheeseburger. Their signature sauce was very good, and their garlic pickles were a great touch. The bacon was cooked perfectly and was really, truly a satisfying burger. The fries were good, as well, and I took the rest of those home. The best part of this visit was that molten lava bundt cake thing with vanilla icecream. The server rushed it out, because it was ""melting, and just let me know if you want another one!"" I told her I didn't care, as long as it tastes good. Indeed, the bundt cake was collapsing under the weight of the icecream, but she wisely provided 2 spoons, so my kid and I dug in. I've never seen Rowan eat so fast in my life, I felt like it was a race against time. It was very delicious, and I give that dessert 5 stars, falling apart, hands-down. A happy kid is everything. All in all, I won't return, unless I'm doing the 2-for-1 drinks or something. I gave our server an  $8 tip on our $16 bill, and I guess she was too shocked to thank me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4

Syd M.,"Memphis, TN",18,36,37,2.0,11/12/2015,"Came here to grab something to eat before catching a late night movie and regretted the decision shortly after being seated. We waited a while to be acknowledged by a hostess, just standing around while staff walked past us. We were seated next to a large, loud party in a tiny two person booth. When the waitress came to get our orders, I asked what time the kitchen closed and if we could count on getting good food that wasn't rushed. I was reassured that we had plenty of time to order and that it was no problem. So we ordered and when our food finally arrived, my mozzarella sticks were cold and rock hard :( Hungry and disappointed, I made the waitress aware of the issues and she sent over a manager so I could parrot the same story. The manager took the item off of my ticket and offered to remake the cheese sticks but for me, it was too close to the time the kitchen closed for me to confidently expect edible food on attempt #2. My friend's food was okay so that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4
Marcus H.,"Cordova, TN",0,6,,2.0,9/18/2016,"My family experience  at THIS location was absolutely terrible, 4 out of 6 of our orders were either wrong or not prepared properly.  Anytime you asked for anything from the waitress like refills etc. , it took an extended amount of time. Also, if I had passed the kitchen on the way to the restroom prior to ordering my food, I would have just left then. Food  was scattered all over the counters and floors (nasty) .

Benolyn C.,"Memphis, TN",13,10,1,1.0,1/8/2017,"We have visited this Chili's location twice in the past month and both times are experience has been awful. The service in both visit was extremely slow.

Yesterday, we decided to give them another shot.  We were seated and our drink order was taken and 15 minutes later the drinks appeared.  After we received our drinks, we ordered our food one of the food orders came our wrong.  We were never checked on once our food was brought.

Rachel K.,"Memphis, TN",303,48,77,1.0,4/7/2014,"I've eaten at several Chili's locations in the past. But because of my most recent visit to the Chili's near Poplar and Perkins, I'm confident to say that I may not again visit a Chili's in the future. The service was absolutely terrible. There was no host/hostess when our group of four walked into the restaurant. We stood around and waited for a few minutes, while other servers walked past us and the bartender just blankly stared at us... Since there seemed to be no host/hostess around, we decided to sit at a table in the bar area. It was difficult choosing which table to sit at. We had he option of sitting at a dirty table, nasty table, and gross table. We chose to sit at the LEAST DIRTIEST of the tables. We sat at our sad, dirty table for about ten minutes. Then a server finally came to clean our table and take our drink orders. Although she wiped the table (with a dirty tag) there was just TRASH all over the floor! When I walked to the restroom, I could see there was trash under almost EVERY table. There was trash on the floor even in the kitchen!! Next, our food arrived. 2 out of the 4 meals were INCORRECT. But because the service was already lacking, we didn't even want to complain, knowing that our complaint would probably be shrugged off. The whole time we were eating, there was a child about 2 or 3 years old, running around the restaurant and through the kitchen. He was barefoot and wearing a saggy diaper! It looked to be one of the Chili's employees' baby. An employee brought his or her child to work and let him run around the kitchen and eat fries off the ground. A man who appeared to be a manager was standing around laughing and not even paying attention to the mess and to the unhappy customers. This location is very unkept. Please look at the photos from this location that I am posting as well!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,1.0,3/24/2015,"I hate this location. Word of warning: do not ever come here for lunch. You'd think being in East Memphis they'd be better equipped to handle a rush, but they're not. The staff are just downright rude and neglectful, even after explaining I am in a rush, I get completely ignored. On two separate occasions when I've been I found the service so appalling I asked to speak with a manager, was told one would be coming by, but they never did, despite me asking multiple times. Clearly then this location doesn't actually need anyone's business. This part isn't this location's fault as menu changes are corporate decisions, but I hate how they keep updating their menu. Things I like keep getting removed and replaced with stuff I hate. I would consider going to another Chili's in the future, but definitely not this one. If I were in the area and needed to grab a bite, I'd sooner grab junk at the gas station next door. It's incredibly disappointing how horrible this location is and that management doesn't even care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20
Aaron C.,"Memphis, TN",34,24,4,1.0,4/14/2015,"My chili's experience wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. We had a great serve. He knew exactly what was what and on point with every question. He was awesome and very friendly.  But, we had problems with our food. One, I had something floating in my water. Two, they salads there aren't tossed and are very, very disgusting. I had the boneless buffalo chicken salad and the chicken looked like rubber and the salad dressing tasted old.  Maybe at some point in the future I will return to chili's and trying something different and update my review, but as of right now, my review stands and I might not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20

Ashley W.,"Memphis, TN",3,12,,1.0,11/14/2014,"Last was hands down the worst service I've ever received. The service actually would have been better if the server had delivered the food and never returned. We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt throughout the meal considering we were a slightly larger party and everybody has off nights, but what happened at the end of our meal was completely unacceptable. Some people just don't have the personality to be a sever. It takes a special person to be a great server and this guy did not have it at all. He seemed annoyed the whole time and since we were sat right by the kitchen we could hear how frustrated he was with his coworkers as well. At the end of the meal one person in our party paid with a card and he was helping him use the kiosk that you now have to use to pay. The person said they would tip him in cash since he was hovering over him while entering his card. The server came back as we were starting to get up and asked the person where his tip was. Give us a chance to get our stuff together dude!! I paid my check with cash and he got really annoyed that I wanted change. I always tip 20% at least and giving him all my change would have been a 30% tip. I've given 50% tips before for service that was above and beyond excellent, but his was not. Just ridiculous. Then as we were putting coats on, I had my one year old in my arms when another server emerged from the kitchen with a large tray of food. The other server said excuse me and before I could move out of the way, our server put his hands on either side of my shoulders and tried to physically move me with my kid in my arms!!! It was insane and I'm sure the whole restaurant heard me tell him not to touch me.  I will never return to a Chili's unless I absolutely have to.

It's a chain, but they have a great happy hour and it's generally pleasant.  I did have an awful experience there the other day, which I feel is worth mentioning. Basically they don't have a server in the bar at lunch, so even though I was told I could sit at a booth in the bar, I just had the bartender (for the entirely full bar). I only got a drink refill after asking someone else for it, and even though I was only about a quarter done with my food, she tried to take it, brought me the bill, and brought me a to go cup ""because it's bigger and you won't need as many refills.""

The only thing and I think this is probably the same for other chili's is that their mashed potatoes are clumpy... gluey overall horrid with a bit of garlic and stuff for flavor... if they can get the texture down... and get their food to come out hotter(not cold just kinda barely warm) that would be great. Also the guacamole... no. Overall decent food, good service and some fun with friends... especially if you go during happy hour, who doesn't love 2 for 1 margaritas or other mixed drinks right? :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20
The J's H.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,157,40,4.0,1/21/2011,"Happy Hour Review Like a lot of restaurants, happy hour only takes place in the bar area. That's more than fine since there are plenty of bar stools, high top tables, & booths to accommodate happy hour patrons. Upon settling in at a high top table, we learned that this particular Chili's location has happy hour all day, every day on drink deals! The 2-for-1 drink deals at this location turned out to be better than the ones I had found on-line. For $3.99 each, we ordered frozen margaritas (strawberry & mango) that were served in frosty mugs. For those that don't like their margarita glasses lined with salt, Chili's lines the glasses of the flavored drinks with sugar. Like salt, it might not be for everyone, but it was a nice surprise. All appetizers are priced from $2.99-$4.99! Thanks to the prices, we were sure to fill up our table with goodies. We had 2 orders of the famous boneless buffalo wings, southwestern egg rolls, burger bites, & fries. It was until I had the boneless buffalo wings that I forget how truly amazing they are. How they get the wings to be crispy and juicy, I'll never know. Too bad the nearest Chili's in LA is a bit of a drive from the Happy Hour Tour headquarters. Another welcome surprise about Chili's happy hour is that happy hour takes place during all professional football games. More and more bars are expanding their happy hour to inlcude sporting events since games often start when happy hour is already half over and people are sure to be there for hours in need of food & drink. It's nice to see a chain restaurant see the importance in happy hour during football. Hopefully, the deals expand to basketball and baseball games, too. Regardless of the sport deals, I will be sure to be back for happy hour whenever I find one in the neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20

Joel C.,"Cordova, TN",14,133,,2.0,9/29/2013,Managment changed a few years ago. It is not what it used to be. I wouldn't go here to sit down and eat. The customer base has changed a lot. I ordered some to-go last night and went and picked it up. I got a real feel of the place not being what it used to be since I have been here a lot over the course of many years. In the waiting area of the to-go section the floor was very dirty with chips and what not. I felt as though the enviroment was on the low end of mediocre and just the general feel of the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20
