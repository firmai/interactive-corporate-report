Chuck S.,"Parker, CO",447,378,257,5.0,8/23/2012,"We came in on a quiet Saturday early afternoon.  4 of us ordered the all you can eat soup and salad and my son ordered the kobe tacos.  Just as my son was commenting on how the tacos were pretty skimpy Steve, the manager, walked by and asked us how our meal was.  The soup/salad combos were great, however we let him know about the tacos.  He brought three more tacos out for my son.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greeley

William A.,"Denver, CO",13,171,15,2.0,4/7/2012,"As a chain restaurant, you would think they could teach the staff on how to remove the uneatable onion skin. The food was okay tasting, but definitely over priced for the quality/quantity. The ahi tuna with avocado crisp were good, but wish they gave more than just 5 small bites worth. They do have a tendency to drench the food in the Jack Daniels sauce, smothering any respectful taste that the meat might have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greeley
Bob S.,"Greeley, CO",0,119,,3.0,8/5/2011,"Like so many other similar restaurant chains, it's usually too noisy.  The food is decent and selection is good but turn it down!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greeley
