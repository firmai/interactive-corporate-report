209,Alexis R.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,8,2.0,5.0,2015-10-27,"Opening day!  Place looks like every other location, nice sized and same decor. Perfect for the Santa Monica Place. Definitely what it's been missing since every other establishment has closed down.  Sat at the bar and was instantly greeted by Andrea. I had my usual, BBQ Chicken salad, and glass of Pino Grigio (happy hour can never steer you wrong!)  Awesome and quick service. Food tasted as it should. Andrea was a pleasure to talk to. I had a perfect spot right in front of the TV to watch NBA opening day games, so I can't complain.  You would never know this was their first day to the public. Will definitely be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=240,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676
438,L W.,"Coto de Caza, CA",1,11,28.0,4.0,2015-10-28,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory. I hope the new location at Santa Monica Place can be as good as or even better than other locations. ---------update--------- Today is Oct 27, the first day this new location open to public. Visited there today for dinner. I've never seen so many waiters and waitresses in a restaurant, of course I know they are being trained . We walked inside and were led to our seats. After a while our server came and ask us what to drink. After the drinks came we waited for more than fifteen minutes for the breads to come. Too bad our server forgot to bring the breads, which are my favorite food at CF. I asked one of the servers to bring us the breads and finally they were on the table. Foods are very delicious as usual. One more thing I need to point out: it was 70 degrees outside. Why did you turn on the heaters??!! I asked them to turn it off, and 30 minutes passed by it was turned on again. One of the managers came ask if it was too hot. All the customers said YES. Maybe in the near future it'll all get better.  Love, L To be continued.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=360,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
382,Alice C.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,125,171.0,2.0,2015-10-30,"Don't really go to large chains, with all the great local places in SM. But figured we'd give it a try since they have some nice salads. We sat down today at 7 pm. Our server J comes by soon after, and asks us for drink orders. We order around 7:25 as that is the first opportunity to do so after we had put in our drink order.  Time goes by...I ask one person (who I thought was a manager) after another about what's going on. Each person say they will get a manager, but no one comes. Then the final straw was another couple of people sitting at an adjacent table, who had sat down AFTER we had ordered, gets their food at 8 pm. We still had not gotten our appetizer. J keeps trying to tell us that various foods take longer. Apparently I look like I'm an idiot since he feels that I will believe that 2 dishes of hot food will take longer to make than 2 salads. (The people looking like managers were trainers who were supposed to help the staff keep on target with their tables, but clearly this was a fail.) The only reason I did not give my review 1 star is because of the manager Rebecca. She was soo sweet, and acted like a true manager, taking responsibility for what was poor service, and making it right by us tonight. I will amend if we ever try going there again. I will just ask for someone besides J.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=280,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

The food and decor is very similar to other locations, but the best part is their patio area! The patio is so spacious and dimly lit, and you get a great view of the Third Street Promenade. The heating lamps warmed me up and it was just a perfect Santa Monica evening!  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.

451,Christian A.,"Willowbrook, CA",4,38,29.0,1.0,2015-11-02,I was so excited to see the new place at santa monica. Went to the bar looks likes all the the cheescakes nothing much has change there. Bartenders were great food was good to. They were out of tex mex eggrolls:(.         The only thing that did bother me was when they told us we had to leave. There was more guest inside the place as well so why can they stay and I had to leave. Felt very uncomfortable as they were rushing me down the elevator to leave. As a manager you have to know how to talk to guest in different situations. And theese two guys we're not professional at all.1 star for management he ruined for everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=300,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

Unfortunately for me and my son we visited this location only to find out the kitchen is extremely slow Alexandra our waitress was apologetic my food came out a whole 10-15 minutes before my sons chicken strips ( nothing fancy) than waited another 5 minutes for his French fries!

I was on an hour lunch break, and by the time the food came out and I was  able to figure it out, There wasn't enough time to order something else or send it back. I was pretty disappointed.

Our order took a long time to arrive and when it did,  one of our party didn't get his food--took another half hour for his food to arrive! They did comp his meal and the food was excellent. The big disappoint was that my cheesecake was not good. No excuse for that when your restaurant is named Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake had a hard crust on top like it had been sitting uncovered too long and did not have a dense consistency--too fluffy. I like a good cheesecake. I will go back though, hopefully they get better with practice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=460,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

We waited forever to get acknowledged and then never had our waters refilled. Not even once. This is at the bar. Where you are directly in front of the wait staff. Are they blind? It can't be that they're understaffed. There's a million wait staff walking around to the point it's hard to walk through Cheesecake Factory without having to dodge through them like its the Super Bowl. Oh no, they don't move of your way. You make room for them.  Maybe because they just opened but from the reviews below, they've got a long way to go.

I am gluten free dairy free, so eating out is a challenge. The waitress had me talk to the manager, which gave me some GF DF options. I saw a dish I loved that had gluten, but he made it work. He replaced a wheat bun with gluten free bread and made the breaded chicken just grilled. He made it double the size also, and took it off the bill for time inconvenience. I also ordered a salmon special that had mashed potatoes and a dairy sauce, which was put on the side and replaced my fries.

Never have I ever been anywhere with such poor service. I timed it - from the time I was seated to the time we were acknowledged by our waiter was 16 minutes. Take in mind it was 9:30 - not busy at all.  Also we were seated at a half booth and we kindly asked the hostess that was seating us if we could get a booth. She said ""that might be difficult as we will have to walk back up to the front to see where we can seat you"" totally unacceptable.  Not only did my menu have food and grease in it but so did my friends.  Food is consistent however service is the worst I have ever seen. I always see the manager going back and forth not quite sure what he's doing?  The solution to this problem is hire senior wait staff and waiters that care and don't congregate in one area and hang out.

445,Optimus U.,"Santa Monica, CA",9,123,25.0,5.0,2015-11-20,"Changing my review. I come to cheesecake quite a bit. The kids do love it. We had some issues last time we were here. But looking at all these other reviews giving one star is extreme.  Many said the food was good, the atmosphere was good. So they need to work on the service a bit. But Cheesecake Factory is better than 2.5 stars. Come on people.  I guarantee most will be back. Give them some time to line things out.  I remember when the new one opened at topanga plaza it was the same thing.  Back again tonight and it has gotten better. Not 5* Better but better. I'm giving the 5* to counter balance some of the reviews that were excessive one stars.  There are still many good things about this Cheesecake Factory. Let them work on it and give them another shot in a month.  It will get better. Just like the one at topanga plaza.  Food is good, ambiance is good, cheesecake is good.  Besides, James has been busting his butt to please us and props to James.  The fact is last time I was here I was pissed and over reacted and shouldn't have written the review without settling down.  This is my 3rd visit and they have improved 200% from last time. So they are on the right track.  Cut them some slack. It's a big place and takes allot of staff.

191,Sara P.,"Santa Monica, CA",27,27,6.0,2.0,2015-11-21,"I realize this location is new, so I will happily change my review if I happen to go again and have a better experience. But seeing as this is the second time I've gone since they opened, I decided to write a review this time.  The Restsurant was very busy, as it was a Saturday afternoon, so I'll give them an extra star for that. But seeing as every person on our table of 8 had something wrong with their order, the kitchen needs to get themselves together.  I ordered a burger, pretty simple, I figured it was a safe bet. This burger didn't come with lettuce, so I asked if they could put some on, no problem! (By the way, our server was very nice, my problem was with the kitchen.) So, the burger comes with the choice of a wheat bun, which I chose, but when I got it, 1) no lettuce, and 2) it was on a roll, like they give you in the basket when you sit down. I ignored the roll part but did ask for some lettuce. When I got it, I realized there was only tomatoes and cheese on one half of the ""roll"" I wouldn't call it a burger. And the other side just had meat, lettuce and a bun.  My brother in laws sandwich was missing the sauce, my father in laws salad didn't come with dressing, and my mother in laws didn't have the right one. The only meals that came out fine were the kids meal 1/2 pizzas, however it was one pizza that they made together (makes sense), but they didn't put it on 2 separate plates for the 2 separate kids.  Overall we were there for almost 2 hours.  Our family was in town visiting and had never been to Cheesecake Factory.  We had convinced them to come because we've had excellent experiences at the one in Marina Del Rey, but they left very disappointed. As did we.  We live a few blocks away, so I'm sure in time we will try this location again at some point.

Other than that, this cheesecake experience was the worst. Service was horrible and you could easily tell that the staffing is new.  1) While my boyfriend and I were eating, a server wasn't paying attention and he was leaning on my boyfriend.. He quickly apologized, made an ""oh shit"" face, and walked away. 2) Our server didn't come back to see if we were ok. Didn't refill our water.  3) We were waiting so long for her to come back so we could ask for the check, so we asked another server. So that server gave us our check and we paid. Then the original server comes back and gives us our check again.. No communication amongst the staff whatsoever.  4) Last but not least, servers were very rude with no smiles on their face and not greeted properly.

Went in thinking I was gonna have a great dinner with my family. Well I thought wrong. Had to wait maybe 20mins when they said it'd be 30mins... got called early and the table wasn't even ready for us to be seated. Waited another 10.. OK. Anyway I looked that over and then our original server was so nice. Well we placed our orders and all and I got the wrong order. I ordered a Hibachi steak with no wasabi. They brought me a steak diane instead..... well done. I like my meat medium rare and it wasn't correct. They brought out my original plate but it was, again, overcooked and cold as hell!! I usually don't complain but I haven't had steak for a long time and I really wanted a nice steak dinner, cooked right. My mom had some pasta and she wanted extra sauce and she waited 20mins for aside of sauce..... we called a manager over to get it resolved and I really appreciated Joe, the manager, for correcting it and personally serving us. He brought back my steak and it was cooked right and it was the right plate... but it was cold too... it's okay I overlooked that as well.... anyway we got through dinner and decided to order dessert. Got our 1st dessert but we waited another 15 mins for a separate one we ordered at the same time! Ok... we overlooked that as well. We let it be.. now... we asked for the check and our server again was great. She let us know she was going to take a 10min break and that DAKOTA would pick up our check and take care of us... DAKOTA came over to pick up the check and we said we needed the change back. Took her 20mins to get us our change. Our original server had been back from break already and asked us if everything was ok and what we were waiting for and we let her know and she went to go look for DAKOTA. Another 10mins... DAKOTA came back from getting change and told my mom she only took 5mins.. at this point we had Joe back at the table since we wanted to leave already to enjoy the rest of the night/beach since we live 2hrs. away... and DAKOTA thought it was a good idea to sass back at MY MOM and started an argument with her!! NO WAY I WOULD LET SOMEONE TALK TO MY MOTHER IN ANY SUCH WAY!!!!!!!! DAKOTA had to be told to not do anything and was walked off by our original server. I was look for DAKOTA so I can speak to her and her manager. I went and followed her around and see maybe I could get her attention. Then I finally got her to see me and in asked her what her name was (I didn't know her name until after) SHE LAUGHED IN MY FACE AND WALKED AWAY WITH A SNOBBY ASS ATTITUDE. OH AND DID I MENTION DAKOTA WAS TALKING TO ANOTHER EMPLOYEE AND CALLED MY MOM A BITCH? YEAH. SO THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED HER AROUND SO I CAN GET THE MANAGER AND TELL HER. So I got another employees attention and asked her for (Dakota's) her name. At first she said she didn't know and then gave me DAKOTA'S name. I got ANOTHER manager by the name Sara. Told her what happened and she walked to our table and tried to make everything right. No way, after all that mess we wanted NOTHING to do with this location again. I never had had such bad service in my entire life. And I'm a chef btw and I have great customer service skills. I've never encounter such an ugly environment and such bad service.. the managers were nice and said they needed to get rid of TRASH LIKE DAKOTA. She made that very clear. So I hope no one goes through such horrid service like I did and I made that clear to the manager. All in all, a wonderful night wasted we didn't even get to go to the stores in the promenade cause everything was closed by the time we left.. literally wasted 2 1/2 hours and money. Never again will this place get my money or service. So DAKOTA if you see this review or anyone that works here in that manner...

495,Elaina And Nai D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,5,,1.0,2015-11-23,First of all we get there and the hostess was nice said it will be about 30 min wait so that was ok. The thing she gives us buzzes saying our table is ready we go up there and then the male host says to give him a min and stand to the side we wait 5 more mins for him to take us to the table. We get to the table and it is still DIRTY! There were still dirty dishes on the table. He asks us to stand to the side while he cleans it up. (Are you kidding me?) we see an open booth for 4 and we ask if we can just sit there and he said no. Ok? Because it makes sense to have us wait more for you to clean the table that should have been cleaned before you tried to seat us but alright. We order our food and it comes out appetizers are good and then we receive the main course and my aunt asked for extra pasta sauce and my cousins order is just completely wrong to begin with. She asked for the hibachi steak medium rare and got the steak Diane well done. They came back with her correct plate but the steak was also well done. And 15 mins past my aunt has not received her extra pasta sauce. And one of the managers came and helped us correct the meals and it was ok. Then our waitress who by the way was incredibly sweet was telling us she was going on her 10 min break and that Dakota would take our checks once we are done and she did. Our original waitress comes back from her break and Dakota still hasn't brought us back our change. We let it be known that she took 15 mins to give us our change and she talks back to my aunt and then turns around and calls her a b*tch. Really? How unprofessional. And a manager was standing right there and he didn't say anything. I couldn't believe this place. I'm visiting my fam because I'm out of town and my first night here and they legitimately ruined it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.18,2.44
128,The R.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,33,8.0,1.0,2015-11-25,Update- 7/22 had a terrible experience and no reply from website feedback form. Will never return. The waiter was nice. Food was not up to standards. They cut my grilled cheese sandwich in to 8 strips. Then gave me one quarter the normal amount of fries in a little tin cup. Big let down. Edit: I got a few comments saying it was the kids grilled cheese. I did not order the kids grilled cheese and was not charged for a kids grilled cheese. I was charged full price. I got a message from the cook saying it looked like I had gotten a kids grilled cheese and next time he would make it right. I still don't like the fact  that 2 years or so ago they started putting french fries in a cup and serving you half as many on all the meals. I'm hoping that next time I'm able to get my fries on a plate and get a proper amount.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=200,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.18,2.4

Our server (Lauren) Greeted us with a huge smile and had drinks and bread out before i even looked up from my menu which was very fast. The menu is huge and i think she could tell i was overwhelmed, she asked if she could assist in any menu questions or suggestions, i gave her my options and she helped me decide that with my love for spice and pasta to get the chipoltle pasta with chicken. It was amazing i found my new favorite dish for the next time i come visit. As well as our delicious desert the oreo cheesecake was to die for.

Also, a lady in a purple shirt walked by...possibly the manager bc she asked another table about their food. Anyway, our waiter Ross finally introduced himself, yep we were ready to order.

The following week, we went on a Saturday night.  It was very crowded and we were told it would be a 30 to 40 min. wait.  Then I asked about a table on a patio facing the mall.  I was told that would be a 20 minute wait.  So I switched to that.  25 minutes later, I was told we had 13 minutes to go.  The hostess was mad at me because I pointed out a mistake she had made earlier.  I figured that was punishment.  Meanwhile, two tables sat empty on the patio for at least 20 more minutes and then she sat someone there that came way after us.  That was it.  I got a manager's attention who said he'd take care of.  I guess if you call waiting another 10 minutes taking care of us he did.  The rest of the service was fine though.  But that hostess had a real chip on her shoulder.  I hope they clean house soon to make it a more pleasant experience for their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=460,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.152,2.68

Our waiter was pleasant but unfortunately he did have body odor which probably bothered only me since I'm sensitive about this. Every time he'd pass by, I'd get a strong whiff. BO is understandable after a long whole day of work but really if it's only 12-noon and the restaurant opened at 10 or 11am, really? Is it necessary to expose us all to that? Can you please use some anti-perspirant? In any other industry, maybe it's accepted if you're an athlete but if you're working in customer service, have some customer service smells to go with it. So all was alright until we started receiving our orders....the bf ordered a chicken sandwich and they brought him the wrong sandwich. And yanno, sometimes that happens! However, what really irked me is that our waitor insisted that his sandwich was the right sandwich and since the bf has been eating at Cheesecake Factory for years upon years on end, he knew it was not the right sandwich. So, they brought it back into the kitchen. But what sucked is that everyone else's food had already been brought out and now he has nothing to nibble on. Ok, I fib, he has a tiiiny salad. But the waitor essentially forgot the dressing? What gives?  So now about 10-15 minutes later the waitor brings out his sandwich and it is TINY!. We're all looking at it like, ""Where's the rest of the sandwich?"" So the bf asks, the waitor looks at it, and then he *insists* it's the normal size sandwich as the bf did NOT order from the lunch menu and ordered the regular portion. Finally after about 2-minutes of back and forth, the manager walks by and affirms that it is INDEED not only the lunch portion but the SKINNY portion size. So now they've messed up the order twice and everyone else is pretty much ¾ or almost finished with their meal. To top off the cake, even though I had specifically ordered the lunch portion and everyone in our party had heard including the person sitting right next to where our waitor was standing, the waitor gave me the dinner size portion and charged me for his mistake. Aiyah, a little too many mistakes, Mr. Waitor--I'm sure in a couple months you'll be a great waitor if you can just stop arguing with the customer when you make a mistake. That kind of just, stinks. Pros: Food is still great! There is absolutely no wait on weekends for lunch. Wowzers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=320,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.152,2.68

I was mostly taken aback by its grandeur -- very nice date place, and its huge. Adrian (I think) was our waiter and he was kind. Its tough though, because big location = lots of servers running with their heads cut off because = lots of mouth to feed = you'll have to wait sometimes. But eating is not just about food, right? If you're in good company, its really also the conversation. (Ie = if you are starving, likely do not come here, lol, although wait wasnt horrible).

121,Romayo S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2016-01-02,"Utter disappointment.  We went to the new cheesecake location at Santa Monica place a few days ago for a weekday lunch  We ordered the Luau salad, chicken scampi pasta, sweet corn tamales and a BBQ chicken pizza. This is our go to order, we have ordered this many times before at other cheesecake locations.  1. The waitress, Rochelle? Michelle? Rachel?, was so soft spoken we couldn't even hear her name. When we ordered the pasta dish, she asked us to specifically point out the name because it seemed as if we were describing a dish, not ordering one. Aren't the staff supposed to memorize the menu?  2. We got the bread, which was warm and tasty like other locations. Then the food came out, after a seemingly longer than usual wait and the waitress took away the rest of our bread. WTF.  3. The food was not that hot, if anything lukewarm. The salad was anemic. See side by side pic for the luau salad we had at the Newport Beach location in November vs the one we had in Santa Monica. Where is the salad part? Seriously it was all wonton skin. And no, it's not the lunch version because there is no lunch version on the menu.  4. The pasta. We cut into the chicken and it was raw. Not pink verging on cooked, but RAW. So we flagged the waitress and she had them fire a new one. In the meantime we finished the rest of our food, another waitress tried taking our plates, even though we were still waiting for the pasta. Finally what it seemed like the manager in red came over with a new pasta, asking us to see if the pasta is to our liking. It's not that we were picky about the taste, we were bothered by the fact that it was raw and risks bearing disease. Anyway yes, the chicken was finally cooked. But now there was an issue with the taste of the pasta. The sauce was not cooked all the way through, just tasted like cream and raw garlic. At least with the first pasta, the sauce was an actual scampi. Midway through this pasta, another waiter brought out another chicken scampi dish, even though we already got one.  5. We were so sick of this place that we didn't even order a cheesecake. We thought we would at least get comped the pasta dish because we had to wait again for another one that was subpar to begin with. But nope. We were ""comped"" for the second pasta dish that was brought out by mistake.  All in all, throughly disappointing. Terrible representation of the brand, and of the locale. Luckily tourists will surely let it thrive. Next time you are at the promenade go to any other place to eat, seriously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=200,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.2760000000000002,2.4

Upon entering the restaurant a lot of waiters were just standing around the hostess desk looking like they were waiting for instruction. Our hostess took us  to overpopulated section of the restaurant that was not very busy looking, a lot of the customers only have water and nothing else. Upon being seated it took 10 minutes for me to flag down a waitress asking to be waited on. The waitress I flagged down told me she's not in charge of my table so she would need to find the waitress that was. Another five minutes later a different waiter came by our table asking if we had yet been served yet to which I replied no and he said that he was from a different section and that he apologized for the delay. And upon taking our order our actual waitress came by and and took over taking the order after the initial waiter had already written our order down showing me that the whole thing was very unorganized. It took another 3 minutes to get our waters to our table, and another 10 minutes to have our cheese cake slices delivered. Also I need to mention that when I looked over to the kitchen I saw a lot of wait staff just messing around doing nothing.

After 25 minutes pass by my husband goes up to the desk to ask if the food was ready. They said they were waiting for the pasta to be ready.  45 minutes later we FINALLY get our food. Keep in mind...the place was practically empty. No one apologized to us...in fact the lady behind the counter seemed irritated that we asked how much longer we had to wait after 30 minutes.  We decided today to give this place another try because we figured they just opened and they were still working out some kinks. NOPE!! Once again we ordered take out.

250,Don W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",223,236,1282.0,1.0,2016-01-10,"I came for Sunday brunch with a group of 6.  I was actually surprised there was no wait, because at any other CF I've been to on a Sunday at brunch time, there's at least an hour wait. We entered on the side with the elevator, and sat on the patio near that entrance. If you sit on the permitted by the glass wall, you get a great view of the 3rd Street Promenade.  Our group was too large for those tables, so we sat In a booth on the opposite wall. The patio is covered, which is great, so you still get the feeling of sitting outside, without sitting under the sun. They also have heaters above the table in case it gets cold.  I didn't realize how HUGE this restaurant was until I had to use the restroom. This is probably the biggest CF I've seen, in terms of the number of tables.  Our server greeted us quickly after we were seated, and the beverages and bread followed quickly.  However, waiting for the meal to arrive took an unusually long time, especially for CF, where the service is usually speedy. Most locations have the speed-of-service down to a science. Not so much with this place. However, after I saw the size of the restaurant, it's clear to me that the kitchen is just too small to handle the volume of tables -- and the restaurant was half empty when I was there.  When it did arrive, everything looked fine. I ordered the California Omolette. You can see by the photo I attached that the plate looked fine...until I tried to eat the toast.  The bottom of the toast was nearly burned BLACK! And the cook obviously tried to hide it by serving the toast black-side-down.  How is this place going to survive if their cooks can't even make toast correctly? I gave my review 3 stars because our waitress gave great service, and I didn't have to wait for a table.  But the reason I come to CF is for the food, and for this experience, the food came out late and not well prepared.  This was by far the worst CF meal I've ever been served.  Note to management: please get your act together at this location.  Most of the traffic on 3rd Street is tourists, and when they see a Yelp average of less than 3 stars, they're not going to dine here. UPDATE - January 9, 2016 I've reduced my rating from 3 stars to 1 star for the following reasons... I returned to the restaurant with 3 family members for dinner, and we sat at a table in the bar. Our waitress was great, very attentive.  When we ordered, two of us customized our orders. Nothing that difficult, just replacing cheese with avocado on a salad.  The first time the salads came, we realized there was cheese and no avacado. We each took a few bites of the salmon that was on the salad before we realized this.  Our assigned waitress had gone on break, so we told our sub-waitress and she took them back.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the salads. This time with no cheese or avacado. Also, they put the same half-eaten salmon back on the salads. So we asked for the manager, hoping that he could remedy the situation.  When he came to our table, he apologized for the mistake.  He returned about 10 minutes later with our two salads, again with half-eaten salmon on them. We pointed out to him some pretty obvious things that he should have spotted as the restaurant manager. First, he was serving new salads with cold, half-eaten salmon on them. Second, how would he have known who gets which half-eaten salmon?   He apologized again, and took the salads back for a third time. At this point, the other two people at the table were almost done with their meals, so the manager said he would like to buy them each a cheesecake, so we are not eating alone by time the salads comes back out for the 4th time. He also said that he would not charge us for the salads. He returned about 5 minutes later with the salads, but no salmon. He said the new salmon was still cooking, but he didn't want us to be waiting for our meals any longer.  About 5 minutes after that, he brought the salmon.  When the check came, the two desserts were listed as free, but they were still charging us for the salads.  So we had to ask for the manage AGAIN to fix that error. This meal turned out to be way more frustrating and stressful than enjoyable.  This restaurant has a long way to go to reach the level of high quality food and customer service that the Cheescake Factory has spent decades to build at their other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=100,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.7640000000000002,2.56

My fiancé and I both tried to make eye contact and my fiancé even tried to get their attention by saying ""excuse me"" with one of these servers standing next to us.

287,Madeline L.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,4,16.0,1.0,2016-01-24,"Very disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory location...  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi which was served on a plate whose edges had not been wiped clean prior to sending it out of the kitchen. I turned a blind eye to that in hopes that the quality of my food would make up for this. Being very hungry, I was eager to dig in. Unfortunately, part of my pasta was undercooked. The first time it was sent back, my waitress offered me some soup or salad while waiting for the kitchen to process a fresh batch of pasta. I asked for the soup, but that soup was never served to me. My food was served within a few minutes and to my surprise, the pasta had been more undercooked than it was the first time around. I immediately asked for the manager. He wanted to reimburse me for it so he offered some cheesecake. The bill was then put to our table and I was still charged for the Shrimp Scampi which I barely consumed. Again, I asked for the manager who did not hesitate to remove the Shrimp Scampi from the bill.  I expected more from this huge and beautiful location. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my food had to be sent back to the kitchen twice because it was undercooked. The highlight for the evening was the front desk staff who was very courteous and also the fact that I did not have to wait for a table. Overall, it was not an enjoyable dinner.

It's always been a great experience as you always know what to expect. It was my first time visiting the new Santa Monica location and I will guarantee that I will not return. I went in on my lunch break and it seemed a bit quiet. No wait, was seated as soon as I walked in. I waited about 10 minutes for my server to arrive to greet me. I placed my order for my meal and for a glass of water. I was brought a basket of very dry bread (I usually love their brown pumpernickel bread), but still no drink. It took him an additional 20 minutes to deliver my water.  I was then brought my entree immediately after my water which was extremely underwhelming. As the entree was placed on the table, the person who brought my food noticed that my table was wobbly. They notified my server who came by and let me know that he was going to fix it. He brought over some napkins to place under the table, without even asking me if he could crawl under the table while I was eating. He would rock the table to the point where my water almost spilled on me multiple times, no warning at all. Was this actually happening? I ordered a veggie burger wrapped in lettuce. The veggie burger seemed undercooked and completely soft. It was impossible to hold it to eat, and almost impossible to eat with a fork as it kept falling apart. It also came with a tomato that looked like it was chewed and spit out, and red onions that were cut extremely thick - not sure who would ever eat them that way.

She informed us that she made a mistake and did not program the beeper. I thought okay mistakes happen and it's a new place. We were seated in a large booth right away which was great. We then waited for over 15 minutes. My wife finally got up to go and find a Manager to alert him of the lack of communication taking place. He came over apologized and offered to buy is an appetizer which was nice. After he took our drink and food order our server finally arrived. She seemed flustered and immediately started to apologize. I felt bad but my immediate thought was why didn't the Manager communicate to the server that he took out order. Our food came out timely with 4 people bringing our food including the Manager. Unfortunately, one of the serve handed me my plate of food which was extremely hot. I dropped it on the table before I got burned. The Manager didn't see but walked up as soon as all of the food was put on the table. He asked how everything was so I made him aware of what just took place. He apologized and offered to bring me an ice bag.  I refused but asked him to coach the server so this doesn't happen again. The key is that their communication is very poor amongst their staff as well as their training. Hopefully they'll improve but I just can't believe how unprepared they were. I will not be back.

388,Teepu K.,"Colton, CA",121,12,,5.0,2016-03-03,"While Cheesecake Factory doesn't have the best food in the world, for a big restaurant chain it excels at offering a variety of foods that are pretty decent. I enjoy coming here with friends on occasion and the desserts are always tasty to boot! All that aside, service is the ultimate defining feature of a restaurant, and this place excelled at that. Molly was the Hostess and was very patient with me despite a bit of a wait. She was clearly doing everything within her power to make sure I get my table and I really appreciated that type of care and attention.  I was then sat at the terrace overlooking the third street promenade with Anthony as my server. He was also very attentive and easy-going. I tend to be a bit annoying at restaurants because I ask for a lot of water, but he made sure I was always cared for, and that speaks volumes of the service. The food was standard but the service was exemplary. I'd definitely come back here given the opportunity.

290,Catherine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2016-03-08,"Dining at this Cheesecake Factory was probably one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. A group of 8 of us went to dinner to celebrate a friends 30th birthday. To start we were told the wait time to be seated was half an hour, not too bad, but 45-50 minutes after we got there we still had not been seated. I went up to see what the deal was and was told they were ""clearing"" off the table and it would be 5 minutes, 15 minutes later and two check ins, we had still not been seated and  we were told it was going to be 5 more minutes. We could see a number of empty tables and it wasn't until the birthday girl went up to say we were leaving that they sat us. Now to the actually dining and wait service. Once we actually got a table we were sitting for about 15 minutes before our waiter even came by to introduce him self and take drink orders. We had to ask for bread, which didn't show up on the table until another 10 minutes, and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. About 30 minutes in we finally were able to place our food orders and who knows how long it took to get the food but it seemed like an eternity. The order was mostly correct but they forgot the birthday girls food. The waiter never really made a appearance during our visit and we had to flag someone down to tell them we were missing items from our order. The manager at this point got involved and apologized, saying he was getting the samosas fresh and that he would ""comp"" the samosas. Good thing the company was nice or we would have all been really cranky. When it came time to pay the check we had to find the manager to get the bill, which came back to us incorrectly, it took them 15 minutes just to process the payments and make corrections. The manager had come by again noticing that we were all agitated with being ignored and offered up cheese cake. The birthday girl ordered and we proceed to wait another 10 minutes to find out that he was going to give a single piece of cheese cake to the group of 8. At this point we had already been at the restaurant for 3 hours and didn't want to wait any longer so we left without the piece of cheese cake.  Given all of the places near by you're better off going somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=380,2.4,2.49,2.49,2.244,2.454

It was miserably hot because of the heaters. We ordered our drinks, my usual strawberry martini!  My husband ordered for us while I ran to the restroom. It took 15 minutes to get the drinks. This drink is always the same no matter what Cheesecake Factory you visit. Not this one. I noticed the pink wasn't quite the right shade. It was too light pink. The strawberry on the side was hard and bitter. I guess the ones used to make the drink were the same. I drank it. I mean who wants to throw a drink away. That's  alcohol abuse. But it wasn't good.   Our server never checked on us after the drinks arrived. It took 20 minutes after we finished our drinks to get our check. The bill was near $30. It wasn't worth the price or the time. And we weren't even offered the bread service.  I would probably give it another try because the Cheesecake Factory's strawberry martini has never disappointed me until this one. It was the service that was the true let down.

She made the ""shooing"" motion and said ""one second""....from across the restaurant. I'm not sure if she thought we were blind or hard of hearing, but we definitely saw and heard their interaction. The new waitress came over to our table and apologized. She let us know that she spoke with Dakota and she would be over shortly.

The sauce was too sweet and not slightly spicy like it's supposed to be. The portions seem to be smaller at least at this location. My plate had only 2 shrimp so I felt like it's misleading to call a dish chicken and shrimp when there's barely any shrimp and barely any chicken. For 4 people, we spent $100 plus tip, and just didn't feel we got what we paid for. They don't even do anything special for birthdays anymore except clap.    Very disappointing for a birthday dinner. Nothing special about the food either. The rest of us had burgers and pasta carbonara. They forgot to bring the fries with the burgers until we had to ask for it. It makes no sense for them not to leave condiments like ketchup, mustard, and sugar at the table so the waiters don't have to keep going back and forth.

This location is surrounded by shopping stores and offers an excellent view of Santa Monica. Upon locating this location, from the street level, one has to take an elevator to get to the actual restaurant.

It felt awkward to be in a full eating establishment and no one there to greet you at the hostess stand. After being seated, about six minutes later, a male came by the table and dropped off silverware. He actually placed it onto the table with no napkin or paper to protect silverware from substances on the table. That was upsetting to see and disgusting. Request was made later for new silverware. Consideration of germs please!  The server arrived and food was ordered. The server seemed like she wasn't excited to be working. No facial expression of excitement.  The food arrived promptly after placing the order. However, there were no drinks with the food or straw therefore, had to wait for drinks and straw to arrive before being able to eat. Personal preference, but staff for the most part seemed rushed and unhappy.  The sandwich ordered was a southwestern as requested. Tasted fresh and the presentation was quality looking. The sandwich was filling. Another person at the table ordered a chicken plate. The chicken was tasty and presentation looked appealing.  Unfortunately, on this visit, the little things mattered though. Having to wait for the check for 15 minutes after eating was also not appreciated.

497,M N.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,13,,1.0,2016-06-28,"I have two young children and a hectic life, so it takes A LOT for me to take the time to write a bad review.  But I had a such a bad experience on so many levels that I had to.  The first time I came to the restaurant with our friends and their kids I asked if they happen to have coloring sheets or at least a piece of paper to occupy our kids, since almost every family restaurant I've been to has them.  Nothing was available--not even a piece of paper, so the waiter ripped a piece of his notepad to give me.  The second time I went to the Cheesecake Factory I had my phone charged ready to give to my kids.  Unfortunately, not only does TCF not offer WiFi like most restaurants do, but it's actually blocked, so absolutely no internet was available.  That wouldn't have been an issue, except that it took close to 10 minutes to get a server to come to our table, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then at least another 45 minutes to an hour to get our food.  Halfway thru the wait, our kids (and ourselves) were out of patience and it became very stressful, because there was no Wifi to distract our hungry kids.  The drink order was incorrect.  We ordered an appetizer that never came.  The meal was incorrect in that one of the dishes didn't have the side-dish it was supposed to come with.  We asked for the bill right away since we were worried it would take another hour to get.  The bill was...you guessed it...incorrect.  They charged us for drinks for the kids even though drinks were included on the kids' meal.  When we got the bill we also pointed out to them that our side dish and appetizer never came.  When they brought the new bill 20 minutes later, they also then brought us that appetizer AND charged us for it.  We never did get the side dish.  At that point we had already finished our meal and didn't want the appetizer.  But we paid the bill, didn't even bother disputing that appetizer, because all we wanted after 2 plus hours there was to get the heck out!!!  Just looked at some of the other reviews and definitely agree about the bad customer service and unwelcoming feel.  From the greeters to the wait staff, to the fact that a huge successful family restaurant does nothing to make families feel accomodated, it just feels like you're bothering them by being there.  All in all, I've had a long history of dining at the Cheesecake Factory, but after this, I think I'm done with the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480,2.84,2.57,2.57,1.988,2.678

477,Ann B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,5.0,3.0,2016-07-01,Very confusing experience during happy hour. The hostess told me that happy hour was at the bar and the tables surrounding the bar. There are  tables/booths in the bar area that face the bar. There were a lot of these empty tables so I sat there and waited for my teenage son to join me. The hostess promptly runs over and rudely says that this isn't part of the bar and there is no self seating. I asked her if she wanted me to move she said no I could stay there since the restaurant is not full. 10 minutes before happy hour is over the waiter brings over the happy hour menu and says that happy hour was going to be over in 10 minutes if i wanted to order that I should do it now. What?? Just at that moment a table of three women at the next table and also wanted to order from the happy hour menu. It seems that this area can either be switched over to non-happy hour if the restaurant is busy. Come on  cheesecake factory - don't be stingy just make this area part of the bar (it clearly looks like it's part of the bar) and just deal with it till 6 o'clock when happy hour is over.

Yeah, I really don't know why I went here during vacation. Anyways, it was a weekday lunch hour and not busy. Generally, the place looked neat and clean. The workers - not so much. Uniform and appearance do not always reflect service, but I felt like that was the case during my visit. Cheesecake Factory, Santa Monica - please (enforce) some kind of hygiene / appearance policies on your workers. Long fingernails, an unkempt appearance and a sloppy uniform are just not acceptable. After ordering our food, we were served essentially room temperature water. As if that was not enough, my plastic cup obviously had some leftover food particle. I almost always use a straw when drinking from restaurant cups - and this visit was not going to be an exception. A second request for straws had to be made, but it eventually arrived. I forgot what we ordered, but I remembered I did finish my plate (they're fortunate I was hungry, or I might've been more critical of their food). I believe my girlfriend finished her plate too. My biggest gripe during our visit had to be our utensils (see photos with knives and napkin). I cleaned my knife by dampening my napkin with a little water and vigorously rubbing the knife. The knife on the right is the one I cleaned, and the knife on the left is the one I was about to clean (my girlfriend's). The napkin shows the dirt that was removed. I believe this location attracts more tourists than locals and constantly has different customers. Hence, this establishment's inability (or unwillingness) to improve their service; they don't really ""lose"" business as a result of their poor service. Yes, poor service (see that 2-star review?).

My boyfriend and I were headed to a late night movie and decided to get something to eat. Unfortunately, our favorite restaurant in the world ( Wokcano ) was closed at this hour so we opted for the cheesecake factory which we definitely love as well. When we arrived the hostess sat us at very uncomfortable awkward seats when the entire restaurant was almost empty and we could have been seated elsewhere. Once our server finally showed up she reeked of cigarette smoke and gave us a very bland greeting. She took our drink orders my boyfriend asked for water and I got a Coke as I always do. The Coke tasted extremely sweet like a Diet Coke and was also flat. When it came time to order she wasn't very informative on menu options. I ended up ordering orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered a make your own chicken sandwich with fries. When the waitress came back with our orders,  she did not come up to our table to deliver the food she delivered it from over a small wall we were sitting next to you which I thought was very odd. Was she just lazy? She didn't bring the sauces we asked for on the side and our fries were completely cold and stale. Being in a rush for at the movies we just ate them anyways. Another server had to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I are amazing tippers when the service is worth it. However for this woman we simply left her a note in her server book saying "" Maybe you should be a little nicer then you'll get tipped. Your attitude was like the food. Cold and stale "".

Since we had somewhere to be and almost half an hour had passed, we got up and were about to make our way inside (where the counter with the cheesecakes is) when the manager told us to sit back down and 'your server will be right with you'. Our server was not right with us. So when the manager turned her back we had to sneak inside without her seeing. Once inside we told a different server about our issue.

309,Nikki H.,"Valencia, CA",0,26,10.0,1.0,2016-07-21,"We decided to go to dinner at this location for my moms birthday celebration last night. We, as a family, go to a Cheesecake factory location a few times a month and have always had a great experience. This was our first time at the Santa Monica Location. We were extremely disappointed and frustrated with our experience from start to finish. We were greeted by the hostess, who was rude and had no personality, she looked miserable and we felt quite unwelcome. When we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes until a server even acknowledged our table. While waiting we noticed that the silverware was dirty and a couple of our bread and butter plates on our table were dirty as well. When she finally greeted us, she threw the beverage napkins on the table and took our drink order. The drinks finally arrived after 10 minutes, one of the water glasses had dried spinach on it, after we pointed it out, she took it away and said she would bring another. I asked if she had any straws on her, she said no I don't and walked away. I wasn't sure if I was going to get a straw with that response. Five minutes later, she arrives again with a new glass of water, with no spinach and a few straws. She took our order and then the waiting began. It took almost 30 minutes for our food. Our food slowly staggered to the table, approximately 5-10 minutes in between each drop and there was 7 of us at the table. As each meal arrived we noticed that there were some issues. We noticed that my mom's pizza was cold, my husbands turkey burger had onions all over it and no mushrooms and a different bun than what he usually has with it. My brothers skinny turkey burger arrived a little after my husbands with a different bun than my husbands and had mushrooms and he was missing his side of double vegetables. My brothers wife's Kobe burger arrived over cooked. She ordered it medium, it was definitely well done and it had a sesame bun. She said she always orders that burger and it has never come with a sesame seed bun. The manager, his name is Keith, happened to be walking by, so I raised my hand nicely and gestured in our direction to come over. I wanted to tell him what has happened. First thing he says to me is, ""its rude to point"", then laughs. Not a good first impression. We all did not find this funny as we were quite frustrated at this point. We told him what happened and he said, ""well did you tell your server?"" (why did that matter?) I said ""no, I saw you walking by and decided to go to the source, as we have quite a few issues."" . He said ""ok what do you need?"" We began to go through the list of issues. He said ""ok I will get a new Kobe burger in five minutes cooked medium, a side of double vegetables, a new bun for your husband"" (turns out my husbands hamburger bun was gluten free. He had ordered the french fries gluten free so we can share, but he can have gluten, so the bun was not necessary)... ""anything else?"" We told him that we needed more ketchup and my mom's pizza was cold. He asked if she wanted another, she said no, he said ""okay we'll take care of that pizza for you on the bill. Ill be back with everything in 5 minutes."" I noticed him walking around and not in the kitchen, where he should be, getting these issues fixed for our table.  After 15 minutes we inquired about the re-fires on the fly from our server, she ended up coming out of the kitchen with the new bun for my husband as his turkey burger was freezing cold at this point, we didn't bother saying anything.  Over 30 minutes go by since the Kobe burger was taken back, we stopped the manager again to ask about the Kobe burger and veggies, he said ""you still didn't get it"" and walks away. After going to the kitchen, a few minutes later, here comes my brothers wife's Kobe burger, still overcooked and still on a sesame seed bun. My brother waited for his wife to eat, so he was now eating a freezing cold skinny turkey burger 30 minutes later, with still no vegetables in site. About 45 minutes later after our food first dropped comes out a tiny side of vegetables. What a disappointing dinner that was. Everyone ate at separate times and did not enjoy their food. We have been sitting for almost two hours at this point we wanted the check and to just leave.  The manager gets our table a free cheesecake, big deal. Took 30 minutes to arrive. We were there for about 3 hours. NIGHTMARE!!!  Horrible service, management is just awful! Ended up paying over $100 at the end of the day for a miserable dinner and bad service....we just wanted the nightmare to end!

Well, they called us and walked us all the way to the back and outside. We told the server we asked to sit inside and she confirmed and apologize because the front desk messed up. Said we can wait and talk to the manager for an inside seating. It was such a mess and we were blocking the way so we said ok to sitting outside. It was hot but there were a fan above us and covers so it was not bad. Our server was quick....so quick she took the order, drop our drinks and no straw for me and never came back until we had to flag her down. Our appetizer of calamari cam quick. soft, great batter but super salty....did they forgot to clean off all the salt? I still enjoy it until the server came and just grabbed some that we were still eating and left. Our food came in good time.....just I did not get any dressing for my salad. I asked for some and the girl look at me like ""you want dressing with your salad?"" look.....I said yes, I like some Ranch. Got that pretty quick and I spent quite a bit of time picking out he rotten pieces out of the salad....they were from a bag and the cook did not even bother to check how bad there were...dont worry I was able to get about 10-15% of edible ones. My ex got the Mahi (tuna) salad and it was so bad he had like 20% total eaten and this guy eats alot. We were done pretty quick, not because we were full, but the food was so bad.

Myself and my family on the other hand was okay with how everything came out and was impressed by a few things.  I forgot the name of our waiter but he wasn't that bad. With the occasional leaving our table unattended for a slight prolonged amount of time, the service was great.  It's weird to hear my mom praise anything that is western food but right off the bat she really enjoyed the whole wheat-oat bread. One thing I have learned is to always trust my mom's palate. Like mother like son, the bread truly was good. Is it weird that the first thing they put down for starters would foreshadow the rest of our meal? My aunt was feeling for some orange juice so she got that while my little brother got Diet Coke and the rest of us got water. Water service was great, other than the Diet Coke our water was always filled in a timely fashion. As appetizers we ordered the baked mac and cheese and wings. The wings looked dry when you look at them, but they were alright. I was impressed with the baked mac and cheese balls, that came with a nice serving of marinara sauce. It was delicious. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya just because I ordered it before. I forgot what my little brother ordered but we ordered miso salmon, herb crusted salmon, and then charbroiled steak.  The miso salmon is the only one I do not recommend. Although the salmon was cooked really well, the amount of sugar in the dish was just so unappetizing to me. My dad who loves sugar even thought it was too sweet. The rest of the dish was good. Oh I also ran into two of my high school friends which was neat.  Overall great place to eat. I had a great time.

Last weekend we saw an afternoon flick and went to grab a bit to eat at Cheesecake thereafter. I was craving a burger and fries and that was when I discovered that on this huge menu, you can either be vegetarian or gluten-free but you cannot be both! They offer gluten-free burgers on every other option - beef, chicken, turkey patties, but no vegetarian. I don't know if you've improved your veggie patty but while you're making it gluten-free, you could definitely improve upon it - add more protein, that's what us vegetarians are often missing in veg items - and look into QUORN products, a non-soy mycoprotein source that is gluten-free! So I had a alcoholic liquid dinner of wine to help me cope with the disappointment that a restaurant with a menu the size of a book couldn't accommodate me. Come on guys, this is California, get with healthier options - if I can get a gluten-free animal based burger shouldn't I be able to get a gluten-free vegetarian option as well??

Entrees: brioche breakfast sammy and chilaquiles, and what appeared to be 2 kids meals. Everything was wrong and cold when it arrived. We even had to ask multiple servers for syrup for the kids French toast . Oh, and they just decided to ignore some components of the order.  Begs the question, why not complain?

27,Aaron B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",535,215,232.0,4.0,2016-09-21,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory like most of the world at some point. However this is the first time I've eaten here with the intent to eat healthy...it seemed like a daunting task but I think I may have succeeded. After doing research and looking up calorie counts, ingredients, reviews, etc. I opted for the Tuscan Chicken dish on the Skinnylicious menu. I ordered this for take-out and was pleased by the simplicity and ease of the process. I arrived 15 minutes after ordering by phone and my meal was ready and payment was painless. I then ate about 10 minutes after that back at my office. The food honestly surprised me. For just under $20 I got a pretty substantial dish of chicken breasts, artichokes, a ton of tomatoes, and asparagus (I substituted the farro for more veggies). The flavor was great, albeit just a little salty. There was some more oil than hoped for too which made me doubt the ""under 590 calories"" claim of the menu, however.  That said, if I'm looking to experience some new flavors with a $20 budget and want to be pretty satisfied as far as portion-size goes, Cheesecake Factory isn't a bad option! If you're looking to eat healthy here just make sure to avoid the carb side options (potatoes, rices, etc.) and load up on veggies. I'll try more of the menu over time perhaps but as shot in the dark I'm pleased!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=40,3.04,2.65,2.65,2.768,2.806

434,Antoine K.,"San Fernando, CA",1,6,,1.0,2016-09-26,"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. As you can see I seldom review places I go to but this place really deserves the bad review. My friends brought me here for my 21st birthday. First of all our waiter James did not say hi, he did not ask us how we are doing, he simply tossed our bread in front of us and asked ""you want anything to drink."" I know this is a large chain and all but I have gotten MUCH better service at much cheaper places. I order a filet mignon and it was great. Then after waiting 20 minutes for the check (not an exaggeration it was 20 minutes) another guy comes up ""hey guys your waiter James had to go on an emergency break Ill be taking over, did you guys get your 4 strawberry cheesecakes yet?"" And thus the surprise was ruined. My friend had gone to the ""bathroom"" to order the table surprise birthday cakes and this guy ruined it. We canceled them immediately. Not his fault, why couldn't James have said ""oh hey they have a surprise"" instead he kept up the consistently crap service he provided in the first place and all was ruined. Not a single factor of the whole night was redeeming. Once we talked to the manager he was very apologetic and said ""dont worry your cheesecakes will be free."" We were absolutely astounded WE DIDN'T GET THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR STAFF. So instead he payed for my steak which again, was nice, but I would have much rather paid for the food and have received nice service rather than get a free meal. And a side note the manager we talked to was a visiting manager and he was great, very apologetic and sharp. Once the actual manager of the place came over and heard the story and I had told him that Im going to give this place a bad review and not come back his response was simply ""ok cool"" and he walked away. All in all if you dont care about the service go ahead, no complaints about the food.

144,Shiran W.,"Culver City, CA",24,41,34.0,1.0,2016-10-05,I don't think I've ever given a business one star before. If there was a way to give them zero star I would. Now you have to first understand the full situation. I was so pregnant about to pop (tired was an understatement) a friend came in town that I haven't seen in years so I decided to meet her at the food court for our kiddos to play. I wanted to eat healthy and there was no line at the Cheesecake Factory so ignoring the bad review I went in. I mean how bad can take out be? WRONG! The lady at the bakery was friendly and nice. My husband wanted something different it was basically buffalo chicken strips with the sauce on the side. I wanted the standard Miso salmon. Mine turned out just right they got him the wrong thing after already missing my friend for 15min waiting I had to go back and tell them it was off. Honest mistake. I waited maybe 10-15 just for the manager and he reentered my order this time correctly. Me being pregnant I had to stand (no more room to sit) another 15min waiting. Slightly annoying no big deal. Except when I got the order it was wrong again!!! I didn't realize it until I got to the food court. Back I go to let them know. I ask for the manager right off who didn't show up!!!!!! I waited and waited standing again The lady who was nice that helped me finally after 15-20 minutes ran back to the kitchen to start a new one acknowledging the kitchen screwed up. Now this is 45min missing out of my quality time with my friend while standing there 9 months pregnant where the manager did not show up to speak to me until I asked for him 3 times!!!!  I finally got the correct order 1 1/2 hours after placing the initial order. By then hubby famished already ate poor daughters pizza from the food court. I voiced my frustration with the manager when he finally came over. He said he will send me a gift card as an apology and got my address promising to mail it immediately. It never showed up. A week later I called for the principle to complain spoke the main store manager said she would look into it and give me a call back for sure. No surprise never heard from them again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=160,2.88,2.68,2.68,2.34,2.7600000000000002

We arrived approx at 745 pm and were told to wait about 15, minutes or so, after seating down at 8pm we were approached by a server who introduced himself but failed to take any drinks orders, he said he will be back.  About 10 to 15 minutes later the server came and took our drink order and food order. we then waited 15 minutes to get the drinks which is unacceptable. The drinks came at 830 and as he placed them on the table he spilled the skinny margarita on me, the guy felt so bad I told him not to worry and dried myself off, at this point I'm a little upset it took 30 min to get drinks and no appetizers. Roughly 10'to 15 min later we received my drink and had to wait a few more min for appetizers which was unacceptable. I then asked about the food and received it around 850 approx , the steak and burger were asked to be medium rare but both came well done, when I asked the manager how they look he said well done and took them to be replaced. Meanwhile we had to wait till about 915 to get the food at that point I was starving and even thought the steak now came cold I just ate it. Also forgot to mention had to send my drink back 2 or three times as it was made incorrectly, also we asked for napkins and Parmesan cheese about 3 times. When we got the bill the manager refused to take the steak off because he said I ate it.. I told him it was cold and he started trying to negotiate with me, this was so embarrassing, he then said he will give me 50 percent off which was unacceptable, when I refused he said ok I'll take the steak off but add the 50 percent back, this isn't let's make a deal!! You guys clearly messed up spilled an alcoholic drink on me and now want me to pay?? I left 45$ on the table and walked out with my family.  Note the manager twice said we are a new store we only been here for a year..

She said she would ask, but then just scurried over to the computer. Finally after about 15 minutes a waitress came over.

First, the waitress and waiters seem very unhappy to be here. They often ignored us, spoke only to each other, and moved extremely slowly. When our waitress took our order, she did not write anything down. Therefore, it was not surprising when our orders came out all wrong. My friend ordered pasta with no onions --- it came with onions. My other friend ordered the salmon and it was cold by the time it arrived at the table. I ordered an omelette with spinach, tomato, ham and avocado. There was no avocado and mushrooms instead of tomato. 3/4 of the orders came out wrong.  When I asked them to fix this, they took twice the amount of time to bring me my omelette back --- and it still had mushrooms in it with one piece of avocado. I gave up and just ate this. The potatoes that came with the omelette took another 20 minutes to get here, which by this time, we were completely done and waiting for the check. In fact, the check arrived before my food even got here. The waitress seemed very grumpy to have to fix these mistakes.  Definitely avoid going here if you can.

The french fries were too salty.  They said they had pancakes but didn't, so my other child ate the burned pizza instead.  My Cobb salad was good.  But after we left, I found myself wondering why anyone would pay $75 for the meal that we had.  Luckily the cheesecake was free, but still.............Given the wait time and the disappointing food quality, I'll wait a while before I come back. The good thing is that I was able to pay and swipe my parking ticket before the 90 minutes was up so I didn't have to pay $1.25 for the parking.

Our order finally gets there, my plate had a ton of mushrooms, we still never received bread, my husband had no water, and by the time the waiter finally came by to see how things were going, I had a side plate filled with mushrooms, cause I poked everything out, and all he can say was he's sorry for all the mistakes but wasn't really sincere about it. He came by maybe once the whole time we were there. Worst service ever!! Never coming to Cheesecake Factory again!! I felt like we were a bother, cause the attentiveness was not there, and neither was customer satisfaction!!

143,Joey W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-04-08,"Most unusual and memorable restaurant experience I have had. Not in a good way. The customary process of sit, order, eat and pay was a challenge here. We went to the bathroom between dinner and dessert and when we came back the dinner dishes were cleared. A moment later, a hostess tried to seat a party at the table. We told her we were waiting for our dessert, and - by the way - had not paid our check. Over the ensuing minutes, a series of increasingly responsible restaurant staff came over and confronted us, accusing us of various and sundry misdeeds, including ""self-seating"" and demanding that we leave the restaurant. A young woman did an exceptional impersonation of Columbo, demanding that we describe our waiter in detail and explain - if we had eaten - where the dishes and our drinks were (""We don't clear the drinks after dinner""). Finally the manager came over and started the same routine, I responded as before. At this point I didn't even care about the desserts, but kept reminding them that I had not paid a check. Finally, they located the waiter and the manager came back to explain that there had been a series of mishaps: table number was in the computer wrong, then the bussers thought we left when we went to the bathroom, then the desserts fell over before they could be served. I don't think he really apologized for those mistakes, and hey, things happen. But he definitely did not apologize for several members of the restaurant staff accusing us of all manner of misdeeds and crimes and trying to kick us out of the restaurant. He ""graciously"" took one of the desserts off the check. For having been embarrassed, interrogated and accused (because of their series of mistakes), I got $8 off.

She told us to give her a few minutes to ""figure out the situation""... so we waited... and waited... THIRTY MINUTES PASS BY and still no drinks. Like how hard is it to get us our drinks?! She didn't even check In with us to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else, yet she was happily serving other tables next to us. But it gets better. One of the food runners delivered our drinks and accidentally placed the beer in front of me instead of my dad, and me and my mom were busy taking pictures to notice. LINDSEY comes up and scolds myself and my parents for allowing ""kids"" to take sips of ""adult"" beverages and told me that I could get her in trouble with her manager.

A manager came by to apologize. No big deal . Finally the food arrives for two of us. My food however did not arrive for another half an hour. When it did finally arrive brought by Katya , it was a well done New York steak  , I ordered a medium rare rib eye. Katya tried to argue that the New York was basically the same as a rib eye , not to mind the $10 price difference . Umm no , I want what I ordered and a New York is for sure not a Rib Eye. So I had to wait again for another 15 minutes while she brought another steak , a rib eye , medium well. They tried to tell me that the steak was rare because the red lights from the outside patio was making it look red. I used the light on my phone to show everyone it was mot pink at all . Either way a steak no matter how done or rare should not be tuff and flavorless like this steak was . Even the waiter agreed with me about the steak and couldn't believe Katya spoke to me the way she did. Especially for being a manager. The way she spoke to was condescending and rude and basically made me feel like I was crazy. I am in the service industry and I know how annoying costumers can be , and I was totally not being unreasonable . I just wanted a nice rib eye steak medium rare.

Our food came out fine... the chicken wings looked weird inside so we asked and turns out it was the vein which I completely agree with I just wanted to make sure. They both were very tentative about our needs and made sure we were take care of so on their part they're both amazon servers and the kitchen did great.

I order takeout because I don't have enough time to eat in. I also want to say this: It is NOT the workers fault. They are very fast and generous when it comes to dealing with the lines. I have no idea why their management would put ONE person in the takeout AND bakery section. This place gets PACKED and one worker will be dealing with cheesecake orders, to-go orders, orders for online apps, phone orders, and running back occasionally getting food.

I've been dining with them for years in San Francisco.         On Sunday, June 25th, we were visiting their Santa Monica location. They had a 20 minute wait which is their usual time for a table of 4 plus a kid. We got sat in 15, but waited 10 for our waiter to say Hi. Our waiter eventually came and took our drinks down. We order our drinks plus a kid's water. He seemed rushed so he asked if we were ready to order right away, which we said yes. He then told us, ""wait, never mind, I'm not ready."" He spend 2 minutes at our table looking for a pen in his apron, then finally took our order. We ordered a calamari to start and their bread which are both delicious. Our waiter brought our drinks and calamari but forgot about our kids water and bread and took down our entrees. Our Stella came with a dirty glass and which we told our waiter, he told us he would bring a new one in two minutes. Which was okay, since he seemed busy, so we just patiently waited.         When another staff dropped of our food, our waiter quickly came to check everything was okay and took our calamari before it was even half done. We all work in the restaurant business and we know how busy it can get, but pulling food before asking if the guest are done is just rude. We asked to speak with management at this point, the manager promised us a new Stella plus another calamari on the house. We got the other calamari dropped of by yet another staff member but still no Stella. We asked them about our kids water which they quickly brought. The waiter passed by about 10 minutes after, not to ask how we were doing, but to sarcastically apologize about taking our appetizers, we just ignored the comment.       The waiter brought our bill crumbled up in his hand, while shrugging and apologizing for not having any books. I get that, but come on! A crumbled up bill. We told the waiter we never received our second Stella and the first one was never drank so we wanted it taken off. He said it couldn't be done so we asked if the manager could stop by. After waiting for 5 minutes, we see our waiter and the manager walk by us laughing as if we never asked to speak with him. Maybe our waiter didn't tell him. Lucky we flagged down another manager. We told them we were really upset at the whole experience and both the manager and waiter were immature. She said she was very sorry, but would try handle the situation.         We finally payed and were about to leave our table when the waiter brings us a new Stella, which we refuse and he followed back by rolling his eyes. At this point we just wanted to leave and never come back.  Not only did our waiter not care about us, but neither did Carlos, A Manager.

How do you run out of bread? That's like Papa John's Pizza saying they ran out of cheese. What gives!??!!? Anyways, they said more bread was being baked and that we should just wait. Um, okay. So we waited. Anyways, when the bread finally arrived, we had been seated for a good ol' 25 minutes already, and they gave us one measley portion of each. Lol. Ok. I swear they used to give like 4 slices per table. We ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, the Combination of Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon w/ Mashed Potatoes, the Tira Misu, and the S'mores Cheesecake. Surprisingly our food came quicker than I expected. I was also decently impressed with how soft and tender the salmon was.

He took our order and was helpful with getting our drinks to us quickly. Other than that, this Cheesecake Factory visit was disappointing. First he said they were out of the wheat bread, which is really everyone's favorite. Eventually he brought some out, but oddly it didn't taste fresh baked or warm or anything. Next I ordered the reason I come to Cheesecake Factory the few times a year I'm in a city that has one, the Chicken Bellagio. When the food came out, he apologized because they were out of Arugula, which is like an important part of what makes the dish. I wish he had told me WHILE placing the order, so I could order something else. I didn't have the choice to return it as my toddler and I were hungry and nap time was approaching.

The waiter didn't offer to discount the meal, and I was also charged for the half lemonade/half water my toddler drank, which seems silly for a family restaurant to charge so much for something that costs them virtually nothing. I could have saved a few dollars just letting her share my lemonade, but seems like limiting the spill factor with a smaller cup with top was for their benefit. Dissatisfied with this visit, which is disappointing because I rarely get a chance to travel to a big enough city to have a Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=80,2.28,2.48,2.656,2.216,2.4

The servers aren't very friendly and they take forever to bring your drinks bring you your bread. They are slow to put in your order for the food and it can take up to 20+ minutes just to get the food that you ordered, even when it's a salad or a sandwich and soup. They are often out of the ingredients that you need for example when I went for lunch today they were not serving anything with turkey and did not offer to substitute the turkey for anything else so we had to order completely different items off of the menu. The last two times I ordered soup came out and was not appetizing. The servers really check in to see how the food is doing.

253,Annette G.,"Carpinteria, CA",0,14,,1.0,2017-07-17,"I would like to state I have been a waitress for over 5 years. We sat near the bar on the tables with the high chairs. If facing the bar we were the table second from left to right. Directly behind the host. Last night 07/17 my boyfriend, cousin and her boyfriend went out to eat our favorite place The Cheesecake Factory. We have been to the Topanga and Thousand Oaks locations great service every time. However, our waiter (male, light skin, spoke Spanish, not positive on his ethnicity) gave us THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!' You ask why? Hmmm well we immediately got seated out our table, not greeted, table was completely empty. No napkins or utensils. Okay, of course as a waitress I understood they were busy no problem. 25 minutes later STILL no idea who our waiter is at the time because we have yet to get a simple ""hi so sorry, I'll be right with you or even greeted us."" I waited 5 more minutes now sitting on 30 mins. Finally went up to the host and asked who our waiter may be to let him know we're ready for him or her. She apologizes and says I'll go find him so sorry for the wait.  Again, no problem maybe there was a misunderstanding. Finally, our waiter comes up to us and apologizes and asks what we would like to order.  First I said can we please 4 waters all around AND may I get fettuccini pasta no chicken, later my cousin, boyfriend, and her boyfriend ordered after me. We also ordered drinks.  Another 20 mins and we ask the waiter when we will be getting our drinks? He said oh that's right LET ME GO GET THEM. Honestly, our patience was starting to run out with this guy.  Everyone got their pasta EXCEPT ME! I asked the our waiter how much more time until I receive mine. HE TELLS ME I NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING. EVERYONE AT THE TABLE HEARD ME WORD BY WORD ASKING THE WAITER FOR MY PASTA.  He later orders me my pasta and apologizes ok, a bit upset at this point because once again the service just getting worse and worse. The pervious busser who originally brought out the food for my boyfriend, cousin, etc finally came with my food. Great, awesome at this point I was relieved to finally get food in me. We noticed our waiter coming with another plate of fettuccini Alfredo and quickly turn around noticing I already had my food. Aka I did order my food it just came late okay that's fine. THIS WAITER NEVER ASKED US HOW OUR FOOD WAS, OUR DRINKS WERE EMPTY BEFORE WE GOT OUR FOOD AND DIDN'T ASK FOR A MORE, AGAIN WE DID NOT HAVE ANY PLATES, BREAD, NOR UTENSILS.  I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU THE BEST PART..... MY COUSINS BOYFRIEND PAID FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL AND HE SAID TOLD US, guys I'm sorry I'm not going to give this guy a tip the service was trash no excuses. I will admit we did leave a tip $1.75. We start to leave the restaurante and my cousin and boyfriend are left a little behind so they could quickly finished the two drinks they ordered. THE WAITER RUDELY COMES US TO THEM WITH THE TIP BACK AND PUTS IT IN THEIR FACE AND SAYS ""YOU FORGOT YOUR CHANGE."" THEY RESPONDED WITH KEPT IT AND WALKED AWAY.  FEW SECONDS LATER, THE WAITER COMES BACK AND FLICKS US OFF. HONESTLY, AGAIN I'VE BEEN A WAITRESS FOR OVER 5 YEARS. YOU GAVE US TERRIBLE SERIVE THE WORST WE HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR LIVES AND NO APOLOGY FOR YOU LACK OF SERVICE AND YOUR COME BACK TO US IS FLICKING US OFF IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT AND CUSTOMERS. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. I'm blaming it on the company I solemnly blame it on the waiter.

He apologized and I said thank you however, it was not his fault but his waiter/ co-worker.

Went on a dinner date with the hubby early Sunday evening called ahead & was told 10-15 minute wait for a table for two. Got a pager & waited & waited & waited several minutes passed & we noticed someone had left their pager behind on the lobby seat & it was going off so we decided to turn it in & be honest about it that though it wasn't ours we wished to turn it in & since we were waiting for a table & whom ever had left that pager behind wasn't going to use the seats could we take their place?? Blonde hostess double checked with another dark haired girl behind the hostess counter to see if it was ok & 2nd girl said NO, mumbled something under her breathe & gave us her back umm O.K. we figured there wasn't much time left to wait on our pager anyways & gave them the benefit of the doubt perhaps it was a table seating larger group whom the pager we turned in belonged to. We waited & waited & waited saw other groups being called, we were so hungry by this point & noticed a couple whom had arrived long time after us called to be seated I couldn't believe this?! I spoke to the blonde hostess again asked for an explanation why was there a hold up on our pager when we already had been waiting 20minutes if not more after double checking our phones on the time & other couples were being called who'd arrived later. She tried double checking our pager to see what happened & apologized for the process, she asked the same Rude dark haired girl with the receding hair line, blue eyes, & brown matte lipstick from last time behind the hostess counter who seemed to be in charge of monitoring the pagers on the computer screen, I asked to know what happened, the dark haired girl just muttered you'll be seated O.K. that didn't answer my question obviously something is either screwed with their system or pagers are falling off the grid, I persisted can you tell me what happened I don't understand earlier we were nice to return a forgotten pager & honest to admit it wasn't ours but request the table paged because we'd already been waiting little over 10 minutes which had been granted was the wait time anyways for us & was blatantly without regard denied & now your dismissing our request for an explanation?! again she replied you'll be seated pursed her lips & gave us her back wOw. I was stunned this was the most disrespectful disregard to clientele satisfaction I've ever experienced, no apology, no B.S. excuse at the least for having dropped the ball & not having called us, no restaurant courtesy compliments for the faux pas plus blatantly rude behavior from the dark haired miserable hostess with receding hairline. Computer error can be easily dismissed, rude miserable attitude towards dining customers??? I don't think so. It's sad that that girl is one of the first things you meet because otherwise the rest of the staff, ambiance, hostesses, servers are totally on pointe on trying to make your dining experience elegant & tasteful, but that dark haired hostess just totally brought the experience to shoot down the drain from the start.

20,H H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,14,,1.0,2017-08-14,"I had dinner here Saturday evening and inadvertently left my credit card behind and this is when the nightmare ensues.  I called in at 10:30pm the following night to make arrangements to come by and pick up my card and I'm not exaggerating when I say, the phone rang 20 times before someone answered.  I knew that they were still opened because I had googled their hours and they were not closed for another 30 minutes.  I proceeded to inform the hostess that I left my credit card behind and gave her the necessary information for her to locate my card.  She then put me on hold and again I'm not exaggerating, for 15 minutes!  I decided that she must have forgotten about me and called back in. The second time, I let the hostess know that I had called earlier and someone left me on terminal hold.  She then told me she would need to put me on hold yet again.  I had a feeling I would get better results if I drive there and sure enough in the 11 minutes that I was on hold, I was able to drive to the mall, find parking and walk to restaurant.  In fact, when I got to the restaurant I told them that the person that they have on hold was actually me and showed them my cell phone which showed I had been on hold for over 11 minutes. I again informed the hostess that I left my credit card and asked to have the names of the managers who were working that night:  Mariana Lopez, Carlos Williams, Arianna Toledo and Wayne Maflin were the managers on duty that evening.  Yup, 4 managers and they still cannot get their act together.  Needless to say by this time, I've lost my patience.  Not one manager came out to address me but 10 minutes later, the hostess came out with my credit card.  I did not leave the restaurant until after the place was closing down.  Hence my Yelp review.   It is my personal belief that they were again understaffed that night as they had been the night before when I was dining there.  If they weren't, it wouldn't have taken 20 rings for someone to pick up the phone.  I would not have been placed on terminal hold twice for a combined total of 25 minutes and it wouldn't have taken them another 10 minutes to get me my credit card.   I have left my credit cards behind at other restaurants and none of them have been this horrific of an ordeal.  I call to tell them I'm coming to pick up my card, by the time I get there it's waiting for me and I'm in and out in less than 3 minutes.   Yes, it's my fault for leaving my card behind but I'm sure I'm not the first nor will I be the last to leave my card behind.  They seriously need to get their act together because this understaffing is going to severely affect their customer service, their Yelp reviews not to mention their repeated business.   Maybe the problem here is they don't care all that much about the regulars or the repeated business because they can survive on walk-in business from tourists?!?  Well if their reviews are low enough, they will lose some of that business as well.  I intend to post this review on TripAdvisor.  Hopefully someone in their corporate office will read this and care enough to make a difference in customer service.  It all starts at the top...if management sucks, if the restaurant is repeatedly understaffed, the service will suffer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=40,2.24,2.33,2.604,2.308,2.2940000000000005

I hate to say it but this time the bathroom was full of pee. I could even have my daughter who couldn't hold herself go there. We walked all the way to the food court to use their restrooms. This makes me really sad for sure.  We visited cheesecake on Sunday afternoon for brunch and to celebrate my father in laws birthday. It was early when we showed up so there was practically no wait. I did tell the host that we wanted to sit inside so she handed me a buzzer until an indoor server showed it. I gave the buzzer to my daughter who was super excited about it. The moment it started buzzing, she screamed out of excitement as this was probably the first buzzer she has ever held. We came inside right away and waited for someone to show us to our table. We waited about 10 minutes which was weird since the restaurant was empty :/.  They gave us a table that was roomy for 8 people so we were happy about that. I ordered the corn dogs and the fruit plate for my little ones. They placed the order right away and brought it out. The kids were super excited about it. Two bites into the first corn dog and they didn't want to take another bite. The fruit plate looked old and wasn't fresh.  We all placed our order and were waiting a good 30-40 minutes before the food came out. We ate all the bread on the table and got two rounds of refills on our water before the food came out. The server was really funny and kept making jokes until the food came out. I believe they may have been short handed on the kitchen staff.  I got the shrimp tacos off the skinny menu. They were very delicious but were lacking a little in overall flavor. I did ask for a side of pico to turn up the flavor a little. The beef medallions were also very flavorful. The cheesecake was delicious. I mean I would assume it had to be for the restaurant to live up to its name. Haha Now my biggest issue besides the wait for food was the restroom. I had to take my daughter in and it was filthy. I was afraid to even let her sit on the toilet.

After 30 minutes passed, I went inside to check on our table. Brittany the front desk greeter said the system was down so the pagers don't work. She claimed to have called us for our table but we weren't there so she gave our table to someone else. Her solution? Put us back on the list to wait another fifteen minutes. She lied. She did not call us when out table was ready. Other customers outside had been called for their tables - we were not. Brittany's did not accept responsibility for the oversight, and instead lied. When I objected, she screamed ""You can't talk to me that way! Do you want the manager?"" What I wanted was a table. At that moment in time, a an employee, she was the Cheesecake Factory.
