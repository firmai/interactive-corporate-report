Ryver S.,"Tampa, FL",0,85,5,3.0,10/11/2017,I wanted so badly to like this place. When we first got there the service was extremely slow. Like crazy slow. But as the meal went on the service got better. The dip was good but a little off. The veggie fajitas were a little off as well. They weren't bad but just a different from the other locations. Could have been the sauce they put on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa
Jim K.,"Tampa, FL",162,251,254,2.0,8/30/2016,Why 2 stars?  Because this location is going down hill.  They served wilted lettuce on my burger.  It was so wilted that it was turning black. My wife only eats burgers well done.  Her plate had blood on it from her burger.  So much that her bottom bun was soggy from the blood and grease.  Are you still hungry?!! We never received silverware or napkins which wasn't good for me when eating the chips and salsa.  It ended up on my shirt as usual and I couldn't clean my dirty self!! Tonight the waitress has been terrible.  We've been sitting here waiting to order the dessert that comes with the meal for awhile.  We finished wating 15 minutes ago and it's not busy tonight.  I love Chili's but this location needs help.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa
Christopher R.,"Spring Hill, FL",4,196,101,2.0,1/2/2017,"Pretty much your average chilis.  Today, they were slow.... I mean sllllooooooow.  All while the place was kinda dead.  Ordered a beer and it took about 10 minutes for them to tell us they were out of what we ordered! When was waiting, I kept looking at the bar and lack of bartender. Where was everyone? For one beer, over 15 minutes.  Food had a minor mistake (besides the soggy fries) but again took about 10 minutes for them to correct it.  Not impressed with this visit at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa

Trevor D.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,7,1,5.0,11/10/2017,"Ordered online. Weary of the time promised because no one has it ready on time.

Nikki F.,"Odessa, FL",42,15,12,2.0,1/15/2017,"When I used to go here more back then the food was really good and I had no issues but the other week when I went with my boyfriend I was not pleased. It wasn't so much of the service, the waitresses were checking up on us which is fine but my issue was the food. I had ordered the chili bowl and a Margarita grilled chicken and went home sick. I ended up throwing up because of the chili and the my chicken wasn't even cooked all of the way... There was pink/red parts in the chicken and ended up not eating it. Needless to say I probably won't eat here for a while just cause I don't want to experience something like that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa
Terrance D.,"Lutz, FL",3,5,1,1.0,6/9/2017,"Empty, Long wait, poor service... All because a manager choose to cut staff. It's getting worse and worse each time I come in.

Shawn M.,"Tampa, FL",1,48,2,1.0,9/13/2016,"Don't waste your time here. This was the worst location I have ever been to. Why you ask?  Because of the following: Debby/Debbie which ever way she spells it. The assistant manager of this location. But when I called to complain, she said she was the manager. What a classic Sigmund Freud case. This is why... She was so rude to me. The location screwed up the order and didn't cook our meat good. Raw meat after I said well done.  After realizing I would get no where with her I stopped trying to make my point. She was soooooo big and tough over the phone, but wouldn't talk to me after I came back. This is so typical of this type of person. I will take the high road, oh yes I could take the low road, and not let this...type of person bother me. Big fish in a little pond. Knows nothing...nothing about customer service 101.  Yes, the meal was comped. The district sent us $40.00 in gift certificates.  But, that didn't make up for the bad experience.  Debbie/Debby.... You suck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa
Lynn H.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,11,2,5.0,3/19/2017,Came in for a quick lunch. We sat in the bar so we could watch the game.

Geoff P.,"Tampa, FL",128,126,6,3.0,10/25/2016,Chilis is pretty standard with decent food and drink specials.

Lindsay S.,"Tampa, FL",1,2,,1.0,3/21/2016,"My family would pass another chili's to eat at this location, but we will be rethinking that. Food was decent enough: 2 salads and a steak for lunch. Only complaint was the terrible service. I'm not sure of our server's name because of how much of a stranger he was, but he was the grey-haired bartender.  We sat ourselves in the bar area and were greeted promptly enough. We ordered drinks and food at the same time, and while every other table had chips and salsa, we were not offered any, and we waited about 15 until I had to flag him down and ask. We then waited several more minutes and didn't receive them until right before our meal came out. We were never asked if everything looked okay or if we needed anything else (my sister and I ended up needing extra sides of ranch) but he was back behind the bar. It almost seemed like he was trying to avoid serving us. I finally made eye contact with him halfway through the meal and raised my hand and smiled as if to communicate ""hey I need something but don't want to yell across the room to you"" but he proceeded to give a few guys at the bar their checks, and then waited, and then processed their payment instead of seeing what it was that I needed.  At this point my brother and sister were cringing and telling me to forget, and I would've let it slide but then he started getting a to-go order ready for someone who had just walked in... The meal was basically over at this point but he finally came over and I asked for two sides of ranch which, again, I had to wait longer for, but finally got. When we were finished, we cleaned up the table and stacked our plates in a neat pile because my sister and I both work in the industry and are very conscious about making things run as smoothly as possible. We sat like that for a while, and a manager had to come by to bus the table for him. We sat with nothing but empty glasses on the table for way too long and for about 5 minutes were the only table in the bar area. Two tables came in and he greeted one, while the manager greeted another. We finally flag him down again and tell him we're ready for a check. He smiles and nods, gets an order from one of the other tables, and disappears into the kitchen... The reason I asked for a check is because I wanted to pay cash instead of using the tabletop cardswiper. It got to the point where I checked the price of the bill ($34.??) and I ended up throwing $40 on the table and walking out. I thought about talking to a manager but honestly I felt like an idiot for feeling so disrespected by a stranger for the entire experience. We walked out completely confused and embarrassed. I can only assume he's spent many years serving has left him jaded, and that maybe he has a bias towards younger tables. As a server, I pay attention to little things when I go out to eat, but this was blatantly rude and awkward.  I do NOT recommend being served by this bizarre bartender.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa
Karen S.,"Land O Lakes, FL",0,71,1,1.0,8/17/2016,"This is probably the worst Chili's I've been to.  The bad part is, it is the closest one to my house.  Over the past year or two, it has really declined.  Went for dinner and sat in a booth that is in the bar area.  It was early (5:00ish) so it was empty.  Most of the tables needed wiping down.  We sat down and all our menu's were covered in salsa.  The window had a large splat of ketchup?  There was salsa all over the window ledge.  We told the waitress, but she didn't seem to care because she didn't get a towel to clean it up.  The only thing the female manager and employees cared about during this time was making all their employees drinks that were heading out to a baseball game. We knew what we wanted to order so we ordered promptly.  She said our salads would be right out.  Well, no they weren't.  We waited quite a while.  During our wait a man with kids sat in a booth behind us.  He was ignored by the waitress for so long that he packed up his three young kids and left.  That table was also dirty and remained that way during our entire stay.   Our salads came out and shortly after that our burgers came.  Our waitress was basically invisible to us, so once we caught her eye we asked for our bill.  That proved to be another challenge because she had taken the battery out of that device that they put on your table.  So again we waiting for a new battery, then for it to reboot so we can pay.  Once we paid, our device had no paper, so we couldn't get a receipt.  No biggie. The female manager came around and we let her know how dirty everything was and how long it had been like that.  Also let her know customers left.  Her only excuse was that the waitress was by herself.  It was empty when we got there and it was the same waitress.  The only thing we could figure out was that if the table stayed dirty, no one would sit there and that was what the waitress wanted.  The manager made no apologies, nor did she make any attempt to clean the mess anywhere. I hope this Chili's closes and something good goes in there.  We have enough Chili's in the area that are clean and give good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa

Tim R.,"Tampa, FL",8,28,49,1.0,1/3/2015,"Why 1 Star?  Let's start by me observing our server drop napkin wrapped silverware on the floor and pick it up and place it back in a basket of other silverware.  When I brought it to his attention, he denied what I saw. To continue the stellar 1 Star experience, I asked for an extra side of salsa and it took over 15 minutes for him to bring it to us, during the time he was chatting at another guests table (attractive lady). The manager on duty was a fill in, and did nothing about it.

Laura S.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,1,1.0,10/21/2016,Terrible experience. They never ever get their order right for To-Go orders. They also have made me wait several times for 15-20 minutes past the time the food was supposed to be ready for a To-Go order. I try and try to give this chilis a chance but it's so pointless and management does not seem to care. I honestly rather drive a little further than ever return here.

Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,270,2.0,12/2/2012,"I've dined at this particular location a few times.  Every time there just seems to be service issues that far outweigh the experience with the actual food.  Most times I've ordered it has been online or by phone for the curbside to go.  I always show up promplty at my estimated completion time, but every single time it takes at least 10-20 minutes longer to even be acknowledged or for my food to be ready.   The most notable experience for me at this establishment was when I placed a recent order.   I showed up 20 minutes later as I was supposed to, and no one came out to acknowledge me for at least 25 minutes.  At that point it was a matter of principle and I called the store and no one answered in the ""to go"" area.  I finally left without my order or speaking to anyone.  I called the manager on duty once I got home and he profusely apologized and sent me $20 in gift cards in the mail.  That was the only reason I chose to give this rating 2 stars over 1.  They really need to get it together with their curbside to go area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa?start=20

The kitchen, however, must be completely disorganized and severely untrained.  We, we being a 2 top, have never received our appetizer in less than 30 minutes. If you try to order an appetizer before dinner, be prepared to spend at least an hour before dinner is served.

Andrea D.,"Lutz, FL",0,7,1,1.0,5/26/2014,"This has got to be, hands down, the worst to go location in the entire system of chili's locations. I live so close that I've always put up with the terrible service and consistent screwing up of my order. Usually just ordering for one, so it's not lengthy or complex. The girls that answer the phone are snarky and will tell you they don't have things that are on the menu because they obviously don't know the menu. The parking lot can be empty, and you can see inside that they can be having a slow day. But they will still not come out to your car or even acknowledge you're there. I always would go 10 minutes after they told me to be there thinking they'd be prepared. Never the case. I would surely be understanding if I noticed they were busy, but that's not the case. I've been refunded for the times I got home and noticed it was wrong. So I guess that's a plus. But I would rather pay and have what I'm desiring then get a free meal bc it's screwed up. I'm talking about getting chicken instead of steak kind of screw ups. Last time I even emphasized over the phone that it is usually messed up so maybe they'd pay closer attention to the mistake that's usually made. I pulled up and was ignored for 10 minutes after arriving 15 minutes after they told me to (bc they are slow and always make me wait). I could see the girl but she was not going to come to my car so I went inside. She said it would be done shortly, and that they made a mistake. The same mistake they made 3 times prior. I thought it would be nice if she had come to my car and told me it was wrong and they were making a new one. Not just ignore me. Maybe an apology for the wait. Then the new order came out and it was wrong again. SO, I now drive 10 minutes down the road to go to the chili's near collier pkwy and I've always had great experiences there! Friendly staff over the phone! They actually come out to your car within a few minutes! They have always gotten my orders correctly! And every time I've been there they are packed and super busy. That's never hindered the great service I receive.  Maybe the dine in experience in Odessa is a better experience. But the to go is a complete nightmare.

Also the food was not correct for what was ordered. FYI if you order something and they are out of be ready to have it changed, altered or not included at all, it's a lack luster practice they incorporate. I mean it can't be that hard to tell the customer,aka the one paying MONEY for food, that a change is going to occur and ask if they approve or agree. This business just chooses to make the change on THEIR own preference to fit their situation. But hey don't worry they will still charge you for what your special request was and make sure to not include what you wanted.   But hey we all know the customer is not always right, especially when it comes to your food and what you expect to eat, so if you are ready for a time you will never forget go to this location.  P.S.
