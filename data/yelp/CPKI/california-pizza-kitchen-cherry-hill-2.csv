Raymond L.,"Sicklerville, NJ",123,107,13,3.0,1/1/2018,"Eh. I haven't been here in at least 5-6 years and I only came because a friend had a gift card they won at work. It's decent pizza for lunch I'll put it that way. The pizza is more of a large personal pizza and a small sharing pizza. I got the shrimp scampi pizza I think, acceptable. The feel of the place is weird, imagine a local pizzeria but renovated and larger, that's the vibe I get from this place. It's not horrible but it's not amazing, but definitely get their ranch. It's a buttermilk ranch with dill in it and probably the best thing there for my ranch lovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2

This was my 3rd time here (8/12/17) and I ordered Pepperoni and Sausage pizza. It's really good. They do serve bread which is also good.

Russ H.,"Philadelphia, PA",158,49,40,3.0,6/3/2017,"Came here for a quick dinner as the other mall options were swamped with '17 grads. I started with the Split Pea and Barley which was good.                                                                              For dinner the wife had the Grilled Chicken Salad which she enjoyed. The salad was fresh and the chicken was seasoned and grilled perfectly. I had the Zucchini Shrimp Scampi. For the sake of time, in one word Terrible. Bland on all levels.

Priya S.,"Philadelphia, PA",41,74,69,4.0,5/28/2017,"I haven't been to CPK since moving away from California. This is a really good chain restaurant. I got the CPK BBQ chicken salad and my fiancé got the Carne Asada Pizza and a Mango Lemonade. Free Refills!  No complaints. Service was good. My salad was really fresh. CPK always has fresh salad. The lettuce is never wilted and the vegetables don't seem that they have been sitting around all day. My fiancé enjoyed his pizza and his lemonade and got a refill.

Matthew W.,"Lumberton, NJ",65,208,20,5.0,1/25/2017,"I am surprised to see so many poor experiences here. I have been here a little over a handful of times over the past years and never had a bad experience I can remember. I do know they become quite busy so it is always wise to call ahead if planning to attend during traditional lunch or dinner hours.  My most recent visit was Veterans Day for their special (I am a Combat Veteran). I believe I came in around 0830-0900pm. I sat at their bar where you can watch the brick ovens. There was plenty of room. I believe at the time only one other gentleman was seated there. The waiter/bartender came over, explained the specials to me and asked me what I'd like to drink. I ordered a beer and asked if he could put the Flyers game in the tv closest to me and he did. I ordered a pizza, enjoyed the beer and enjoyed the pizza when it came. It did not take long for my order. The bartender checked in regularly and we shared in some conversation. It was a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2

First of all there were crumbs on my seat which I noticed after I had sat down. Second the waiter brought us stale bread which we didn't care about because we were there for the pizza. Thirdly, the marinara sauce for our rolls was cold. Fourth, the tostada pizza we had ordered had most of the salad in the middle, barely had any herb ranch sauce and what is supposed to be a crispy pizza was hard and chewy! The waiter took away food and plates before we were even done eating. The food was barely edible and was completely disappointed as I had heard some great things about CPK!

We were seated at a table that hadn't been properly cleaned so it wasn't set & there were crumbs around. Not great, but no big deal. We ordered drinks & food, it came out approximately 15 minutes later and everything was fine. The only standout was the buffalo cauliflower, which satisfied a craving I had all week. It was fairly slow at the time we came in but most of the staff seemed disinterested. I've been here before & had better experiences, so maybe it was just an off night...

Mario F.,"Hoboken, NJ",9,62,87,2.0,4/16/2017,"I ate at California pizza kitchen Few times in he past maybe 3+ years ago. I have been mostly going to blaze pizza once opened up nearby and since I have not been there for a few years i said this will be a good time to check it out on my way back from Washington DC trip and a pit stop in Cherry Hill. Wow all I will say they will need to change business model soon as Blaze pizza will hands down destroy them when it comes to coal fired pizza. We ordered a plain pie  for the kids to split and when it was ordered I just said 1 kids pizza to split as kids were not that hungry. We also ordered 2 salads to keep it light, 1 half size w chicken 15$ and full size arugula and Quinoa with Salmon 19$. I also ordered Moscow mule 10$. The salads below average very plain not tasty you would expect a lot more for the price paid. Honesty I had better almost any place I can think of. The drink way too sweet the worst Moscow mule I had. All I tasted was lime juice and no alcohol. Now to the pizza, it looked like a good size kids pizza with way too much crust , it turned out this was a regular size pizza that was 11.99!! Wow.. the waitress ended  up changing it it to 5.99 but kind of put it on me that I didn't explain?? What is there to explain I ordered plain pizza to split for my 4 year old kids to split from the children's menu? The kids pizza is super small as I have peeked and seen from another family nearby! We are used to paying 5$ for super nice Blaze pizza much tastier with no huge crust which we all know kids don't like. Service overall below mediocre Waitress disappeared for 10+ minutes and had to ask around for out waitress as we had to leave. I will never come back to this place period, waste of money And no value at all. This business coal fired pizza model restaurant need to change before I visit for now I will stick with Applebees and Blaze pizza for much better quality service and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2

Clinton F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",14,43,6,3.0,8/24/2016,"I eat at CPKs all over the country. It's almost impossible to have a bad experience. This one is an exception. I've eaten here many times, and although I've had several reasonably average experiences, most of the time something goes wrong. It might be a long delay in getting your food, or  inexperienced service, or a dish that you've had many times that's not quite right. Or it might be that the music is really loud on the patio, to the point where the speakers are distorting. Or It might be that the lights on the patio are really bright like you're in a diner. Or it might be that no one is there to greet you when you arrive at the podium. Something is almost always slightly off.

But that night, I feel the service was a bit short. If not, I wouldv'e give a 4-stars. However the food is always good! My fave is the kungpao spaghetti with shrimp. It's very flavourful!! Always a hit for me! My husband tried the California special pizza ... Which looked very ""healthy"" with all greens on top of the pizza. But the taste was just nothing special.

I thought it was just busy in the past, but tonight we ordered ahead, and went in exactly when it said our order would be done. Guess what!? It wasn't. It was mostly empty, so what were they doing for those 20 minutes when we had called ahead? We had to sit and wait 7 minutes. I know it's not long, but it's disappointing. The hostess didn't apologize for the wait. We got the order home, and the salads didn't even have what we ordered on them. We paid extra for avocado, yet it wasn't there.

They have a few gluten free options that are safe for people with celiac, including a few pizzas that are made separately. They are especially careful and even have the manager oversee the preparation of the gluten free items and bring them out specially to make sure there isn't cross contact.  It's usually not that full so it's a good place to stop while shopping at the cherry hill mall.

Waiter was pretty busy, seems like they're understaffed. Pizza is overpriced and not even remotely worth the price of the meals. There were 7 of us and we all got a different pizza, all with the reaction that it was O.K. Meal wasn't worth $269, it's worth $150. Quality isn't that great at all to be driving from Philadelphia to New Jersey. Drinks were NOT made right. They all had too little or too much alcohol. (that's 7 messed up drinks, 7 meh pizzas) Overall experience is that it's an ok place, but I would not both driving a long way here nor would I pay this much for mediocre pizza. Would not go here again. Bread and oil was like someone who doesn't know how to cook mushing all those ingredients together, did not taste good. Same with the rest of the food we got.

Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",276,476,329,2.0,8/1/2014,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) recently donated food to a local animal rescue event I attended. After trying a sample of their chicken cesar  sandwich, I knew I needed to go and have the full thing.  So on a late Sunday afternoon I battled the parking at the Cherry Hill Mall and made my way to CPK. I was warmly greeted and seated right away in the empty restaurant. It wasn't until a few minutes in that I realized there was outdoor seating- the hostess never offered this.  I didn't even have to look at the menu- as I knew what I was getting. I decided to get an appetizer because I had a free small plate coupon- I went with the mushroom and spinach flat bread- it was delicious and came with 4 reasonably sized pieces. Normally its about $5.  I was happy to see that the chicken cesar salad sandwich came with a side salad that comes out with the dish. The sandwich was as great as I remembered- all of it was delicious. That was until I bit into a cold piece of chicken- very gross.  I expected better service since it was a slow Sunday afternoon. The waitress didn't pay much attention to us, because instead the wait staff was busy socializing. When it came time to pay the bill- the waitress brought over the check. I put my credit card in and waited 15 minutes. Finally after realizing the waitress was too caught up in hanging out I switched my payment to cash and left. I'm not sure the waitress even knew I left. This could be a great place- they have an awesome menu, tons of drinks, a great customer rewards app, and a very cool trendy atmosphere- but they need to pay more attention to detail and their customers.  I won't be writing off California Pizza Kitchen completely, but I don't think I will be visiting this specific location any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=20

The bartender is obviously too busy conversing with the kitchen to make our drinks. And out comes the appetizer. But no water. When we questioned this, the expeditor looked at us blankly. A manager was requested and the appetizer was sent back with our server, who by this time had displayed a level of incompetence that is exemplary at this time.

Nancy P.,"New York, NY",364,583,233,3.0,7/19/2011,"My first experience with California Pizza Kitchen was before the Harry Potter movie in Cherry Hill. The place itself was nice..open kitchen and a roomy dining area.  I started off with the White Sangria. This was very pineapply and too sweet; I probably wouldn't get it again.  We started with the Avocado Club Egg rolls. Bacon, cheese, chicken, avocado..I'm already a fan. It was great with the ranchito sauce. We also got the Waldorf salad but I wasn't really into it.  For pizzas, we got the wild mushroom pizza with chicken. Such a yummy white pie and I really like mushrooms. The margherita was okay. It needed more sauce (which we asked for but never received).  Lastly, we ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti. This was also a miss for me. A bit spicy but the flavors weren't great. A lot of the peanuts in the dish were burnt.  The pizzas were kind of on the smaller side for the price. It's pretty good for a chain restaurant though. I guess you could consider this place 'kid-friendly'.

I had a hankering for some BBQ chicken pizza and headed straight over. Hostess was really friendly and asked if we had a seating preference and accommodated our request of a booth next to the TV so we can watch sports.  I was pleased to see they had the thin and crispy option of pizza for $1.25 more. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, as I mentioned earlier and the boyfriend had the Habanero Carnitas. Fantastic.

The Waldorf salad was ok--but didn't like it enough to order it again should we come back. The Wild Mushroom pizza was also a table favorite. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was lacking a bit on the flavor end but it wasn't terrible either--my girlfriend found it spicey but i found that it just had a slight kick to it.

Jade V.,"San Jose, CA",315,383,405,3.0,3/21/2012,"A reliable chain restaurant experience. I know CPK gets a bad rap for being crazily unhealthy, but sometimes you just want a cheesy, oily pizza. Or pasta. Or appetizer. Maybe it's something about Saturday nights. Because that's when we came; a Saturday night after a long day of running errands. Tons of people in line, but because there were just two of us, we managed to grab some of the first-come-first-serve sitting room at the bar. CPK had a full house that night, so it took a while for our server, who was also the bartender, to get to us that night, but it was pretty understandable. You know, up until this visit, I didn't realize that this was a ""thing"" people did: Stand at the bar without grabbing a seat and order drinks. Just a standing bar! No seat required! Maybe I'll try it sometime. But I digress. While service was understandably slow, the bartender/server was extremely friendly and helpful. The drinks were good, the bar area was clean, and, most importantly for our hungry bellies, the food came very quickly! It's CPK, so prices are standard, but it seemed like a decent value to me.

Let me start from when i step my foot in the door. There where people standing and sitting in the waiting area. So I already knew it was going to be a wait. As we approach the host stand we were greeted properly. We where given a 30-35min wait time. We where fine with that. (Last visit the hosts where very disorganized)So me and my girlfriends decide to go to the bar to have a drink or two while we wait for our table. First things I notice is that it was type cold inside. The heat needed to be turn up some.(last time is was nice and warm)We sat at the bar and the bartender was making a drink. First thing I notice was the way his face was all screw up. He looked like he hated his job. It took him 10min to approach us. When he do  he acted like we was disturbing him. So we didn't bother getting his name. After We receive our drinks. We drink quickly. Then we went back to the front.(last time the bartender was friendly and cheerful. A bartender name worth remembering Craig). 5min after returning to the waiting area. Our names was call. The server greeted us properly. Marissa was friendly and aware of the menu. We need more servers like her.(last time the server Stevie was unaware of the menu. Took for ever to greet us and took for ever to check us out). The meal was great. Both visit! Good job kitchen. The only thing that bug me was the Guy Supervisor sweeping under the table while we eat. Like hello sweep when people are not eating at the table. After dinner we our server check us out promptly.

I had the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and the husband had the Habanero Carnitas Pizza. Mine was a classic, good stand by. My husbands was SO GOOD.

Cookie R.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",60,25,5,4.0,4/24/2013,"An under-utilized dining option at the Macy's wing of the Cherry Hill Mall, California Pizza Kitchen has a menu that delivers on its promise. Take a look at the menu, there's plenty more than pizza. I've been sampling my way around that menu lately, and I've yet to find an item I wasn't pleased with. So far of the pizzas, my favorite is the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach. While these are pizzas it would be nice to share, I embarassingly polished mine off in one sitting. Making happy food noises while I did it too. I dig the lettuce wraps, similar to the ones at PFChangs/Pei Wei. The split pea and barley soup is good. There's flavorful fish tacos.  The new addition section of the menu had a salad that featured quinoa that was good, though the little bits of asparagus in it were a texture disconnect as it was too raw a feeling, when asked what I'd like to add, I learned salmon was an option. It was outstanding. When you dine take-out with them, they are generous with the utensils. When you dine in the restaurant, there's a wonderful selection of drinks. The strawberry pina colada was too good.  The staff is very accommodating and on a recent visit was happy to help our large party out of the who-has-cash-and-who-brought-credit-cards jam by issuing separate checks. The ambiance is good, the music great without being distracting. Full disclosure, this CPK partnered with my store in our Earth Month fundraising with a dining out event. I'm sharing this not just so you know I'm interested in them doing well, but because I would encourage anyone who is looking to do a fundraising event to work with them.  If there's anything I'd have be different it pertains, as usual, to my own selfishness. I'd have them stay open a little later like some of the other restaurants at the Cherry Hill Mall. I'd love to unwind there, or bring home items from their wonderful takeout menu. Alas, with the exception of Sunday, they close at 9:30. Same time the mall closes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=40

Instead of ignoring us like other restaurants would have, the hostess came out and explained the waiter was also sat with the large party and took our drink order - vodka clubs. It was obvious this was out of her expertise, but kudos to her for taking care of us. Then the manager came out to greet us and ask if we had any questions about the menu while we were waiting.

Susan B.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,12,,1.0,1/28/2010,"Worst. Service. Ever. I usually find it silly when people write reviews for chain restaurants, because although a lot of times I get bad service when I go to them, I still go back because of a dish I crave or just need to have. This is definitely the case for this CPK. I want to preface this rant by saying that during my summer breaks from attending university, I work as a server at a restaurant at the same level as CPK. I consider myself laid back when I go out to eat, as long as you get me my drink and food without much fuss then I'm more than happy to tip 20%. If you're funny, definitely 20+%. I met my friend here a few days after Christmas to catch up around 6:30. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes, and the hostesses were very sweet. When we were sat, we waited at least 10 minutes for our server to even acknowledge our existence. I order a soda (still 4 months away from 21) and my friend orders a simple draft beer. She comes back 5-10 minutes later saying their computers were crashing again and she apologized for the wait. I would be fine with this, however she didn't have our drinks. I know you have to use a computer to get most drinks from the bar, but she could've brought my soda and my friend a water, right? She takes our order without writing it down, which I know is a mistake from the get-go. I have one modification on my pizza. To make a long story short, my order is run out by a food runner/other server and is not correct. He says the kitchen is making me a new one. Our server never comes to check for at least 15 minutes, though I see her standing around talking to the bartenders and in the kitchen. I don't get the pizza for another 15 minutes, totaling 30 minutes total. When I do get it, it's the same food runner/other server and this time it's still wrong. When I say that I didn't want bacon on it (that they decided to add for whatever reason) he responds with ""Well I'm not your server."" Finally the server get the manager who was very nice, and got me a nice warm barbeque chicken pizza with onion and cheese and no cilantro. I devour it in 6 seconds. The waitress asks if I want another soda, she returns with Coke instead of Diet (not a big deal, I know, but at this point she was just annoying me.) The manager compted our bill, which I thought was a little drastic, but hey I'm not complaining! THE WORST PART, though, was that the whole time I'm waiting for the second pizza, the server (Jamie, I believe was her name) kept coming up and saying it wasn't her fault, it was the kitchen, etc. Scrounging for a tip. I hate that. Hate it. We left her $5, I think due to guilt over the compted bill, but we should've left her $1. Maybe it was post-holiday stress, but they need to get their act together.

The feel of the place is weird, imagine a local pizzeria but renovated and larger, that's the vibe I get from this place. It's not horrible but it's not amazing, but definitely get their ranch.

Wow all I will say they will need to change business model soon as Blaze pizza will hands down destroy them when it comes to coal fired pizza. We ordered a plain pie  for the kids to split and when it was ordered I just said 1 kids pizza to split as kids were not that hungry. We also ordered 2 salads to keep it light, 1 half size w chicken 15$ and full size arugula and Quinoa with Salmon 19$. I also ordered Moscow mule 10$. The salads below average very plain not tasty you would expect a lot more for the price paid. Honesty I had better almost any place I can think of. The drink way too sweet the worst Moscow mule I had. All I tasted was lime juice and no alcohol. Now to the pizza, it looked like a good size kids pizza with way too much crust , it turned out this was a regular size pizza that was 11.99!! Wow.. the waitress ended  up changing it it to 5.99 but kind of put it on me that I didn't explain?? What is there to explain I ordered plain pizza to split for my 4 year old kids to split from the children's menu? The kids pizza is super small as I have peeked and seen from another family nearby! We are used to paying 5$ for super nice Blaze pizza much tastier with no huge crust which we all know kids don't like. Service overall below mediocre Waitress disappeared for 10+ minutes and had to ask around for out waitress as we had to leave.

Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, United States",276,476,329,2.0,1/8/2014,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) recently donated food to a local animal rescue event I attended. After trying a sample of their chicken cesar  sandwich, I knew I needed to go and have the full thing.  So on a late Sunday afternoon I battled the parking at the Cherry Hill Mall and made my way to CPK. I was warmly greeted and seated right away in the empty restaurant. It wasn't until a few minutes in that I realized there was outdoor seating- the hostess never offered this.  I didn't even have to look at the menu- as I knew what I was getting. I decided to get an appetizer because I had a free small plate coupon- I went with the mushroom and spinach flat bread- it was delicious and came with 4 reasonably sized pieces. Normally its about $5.  I was happy to see that the chicken cesar salad sandwich came with a side salad that comes out with the dish. The sandwich was as great as I remembered- all of it was delicious. That was until I bit into a cold piece of chicken- very gross.  I expected better service since it was a slow Sunday afternoon. The waitress didn't pay much attention to us, because instead the wait staff was busy socializing. When it came time to pay the bill- the waitress brought over the check. I put my credit card in and waited 15 minutes. Finally after realizing the waitress was too caught up in hanging out I switched my payment to cash and left. I'm not sure the waitress even knew I left. This could be a great place- they have an awesome menu, tons of drinks, a great customer rewards app, and a very cool trendy atmosphere- but they need to pay more attention to detail and their customers.

The bartender is obviously too busy conversing with the kitchen to make our drinks. And out comes the appetizer. But no water. When we questioned this, the expeditor looked at us blankly. A manager was requested and the appetizer was sent back with our server, who by this time had displayed a level of incompetence that is exemplary at this time.

The place itself was nice..open kitchen and a roomy dining area.  I started off with the White Sangria. This was very pineapply and too sweet; I probably wouldn't get it again.  We started with the Avocado Club Egg rolls. Bacon, cheese, chicken, avocado..I'm already a fan. It was great with the ranchito sauce. We also got the Waldorf salad but I wasn't really into it.  For pizzas, we got the wild mushroom pizza with chicken. Such a yummy white pie and I really like mushrooms. The margherita was okay. It needed more sauce (which we asked for but never received).  Lastly, we ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti. This was also a miss for me. A bit spicy but the flavors weren't great. A lot of the peanuts in the dish were burnt.  The pizzas were kind of on the smaller side for the price. It's pretty good for a chain restaurant though. I guess you could consider this place 'kid-friendly'.

Also shared the Tuscan hummus which is made with white beans rather than chickpeas (not my fav) and the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (sauce was awesome, but dumplings were boiled rather than pan seared).

He ordered a mac and cheese appetizer, I ordered the lettuce wraps, and we ordered our entrees. The server was extremely friendly and made conversation with us, making us very comfortable. Then it all went down hill from there. My lettuce wraps came out but my husband's appetizer didn't. We figured it took a little longer and didn't think anything of it at first. We waited 10 minutes. My husband began to get a little annoyed because he was starving and asked the server about his mac and cheese appetizer and she quickly went to the back to find out what happened to it. She returned within a few minutes to tell us that it should be out in a few minutes. We waited another 15 minutes before she returned with our entrees and an apology about the appetizer. She offered to take the mac and cheese off the bill but my husband declined the order and just enjoyed his pizza, which was Hawaiian BBQ but more bbq than anything else. My Waldorf salad was also soaking in dressing. Huge no no. Anyway, about ten minutes after we got our entrees someone who seemed to be the manager came over to apologize again and told us that she had taken both appetizers off the bill and we could get a free dessert. Great effort on their part but still super annoyed.

Susan B.,"Philadelphia, United States",2,12,,1.0,28/1/2010,"Worst. Service. Ever. I usually find it silly when people write reviews for chain restaurants, because although a lot of times I get bad service when I go to them, I still go back because of a dish I crave or just need to have. This is definitely the case for this CPK. I want to preface this rant by saying that during my summer breaks from attending university, I work as a server at a restaurant at the same level as CPK. I consider myself laid back when I go out to eat, as long as you get me my drink and food without much fuss then I'm more than happy to tip 20%. If you're funny, definitely 20+%. I met my friend here a few days after Christmas to catch up around 6:30. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes, and the hostesses were very sweet. When we were sat, we waited at least 10 minutes for our server to even acknowledge our existence. I order a soda (still 4 months away from 21) and my friend orders a simple draft beer. She comes back 5-10 minutes later saying their computers were crashing again and she apologized for the wait. I would be fine with this, however she didn't have our drinks. I know you have to use a computer to get most drinks from the bar, but she could've brought my soda and my friend a water, right? She takes our order without writing it down, which I know is a mistake from the get-go. I have one modification on my pizza. To make a long story short, my order is run out by a food runner/other server and is not correct. He says the kitchen is making me a new one. Our server never comes to check for at least 15 minutes, though I see her standing around talking to the bartenders and in the kitchen. I don't get the pizza for another 15 minutes, totaling 30 minutes total. When I do get it, it's the same food runner/other server and this time it's still wrong. When I say that I didn't want bacon on it (that they decided to add for whatever reason) he responds with ""Well I'm not your server."" Finally the server get the manager who was very nice, and got me a nice warm barbeque chicken pizza with onion and cheese and no cilantro. I devour it in 6 seconds. The waitress asks if I want another soda, she returns with Coke instead of Diet (not a big deal, I know, but at this point she was just annoying me.) The manager compted our bill, which I thought was a little drastic, but hey I'm not complaining! THE WORST PART, though, was that the whole time I'm waiting for the second pizza, the server (Jamie, I believe was her name) kept coming up and saying it wasn't her fault, it was the kitchen, etc. Scrounging for a tip. I hate that. Hate it. We left her $5, I think due to guilt over the compted bill, but we should've left her $1. Maybe it was post-holiday stress, but they need to get their act together.

It wasn't even a good wine, but the novelty of being able to order a bottle of wine at a restaurant for under thirty bucks is pretty incredible. Unfortunately, I do not think many people take advantage of this stellar deal because our server couldn't open the bottle. I found it endearing.  I always get the spaghettini with tom/basil sauce and goat cheese. And it is always delish. The hubs got THE WORKS pizza. I think only men are allowed to order it because it has such a manly name and it consists of everything but the kitchen sink: pepperoni, onions, peppers, olives, mushrooms,  and some mystery meat.

Tons of people in line, but because there were just two of us, we managed to grab some of the first-come-first-serve sitting room at the bar. CPK had a full house that night, so it took a while for our server, who was also the bartender, to get to us that night, but it was pretty understandable. You know, up until this visit, I didn't realize that this was a ""thing"" people did: Stand at the bar without grabbing a seat and order drinks. Just a standing bar! No seat required! Maybe I'll try it sometime. But I digress. While service was understandably slow, the bartender/server was extremely friendly and helpful. The drinks were good, the bar area was clean, and, most importantly for our hungry bellies, the food came very quickly! It's CPK, so prices are standard, but it seemed like a decent value to me.

First thing I notice was the way his face was all screw up. He looked like he hated his job. It took him 10min to approach us. When he do  he acted like we was disturbing him. So we didn't bother getting his name. After We receive our drinks. We drink quickly. Then we went back to the front.(last time the bartender was friendly and cheerful. A bartender name worth remembering Craig). 5min after returning to the waiting area. Our names was call. The server greeted us properly. Marissa was friendly and aware of the menu. We need more servers like her.(last time the server Stevie was unaware of the menu. Took for ever to greet us and took for ever to check us out). The meal was great. Both visit! Good job kitchen.

Cookie R.,"Haddon Heights, United States",60,25,5,4.0,24/4/2013,"An under-utilized dining option at the Macy's wing of the Cherry Hill Mall, California Pizza Kitchen has a menu that delivers on its promise. Take a look at the menu, there's plenty more than pizza. I've been sampling my way around that menu lately, and I've yet to find an item I wasn't pleased with. So far of the pizzas, my favorite is the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach. While these are pizzas it would be nice to share, I embarassingly polished mine off in one sitting. Making happy food noises while I did it too. I dig the lettuce wraps, similar to the ones at PFChangs/Pei Wei. The split pea and barley soup is good. There's flavorful fish tacos.  The new addition section of the menu had a salad that featured quinoa that was good, though the little bits of asparagus in it were a texture disconnect as it was too raw a feeling, when asked what I'd like to add, I learned salmon was an option. It was outstanding. When you dine take-out with them, they are generous with the utensils. When you dine in the restaurant, there's a wonderful selection of drinks. The strawberry pina colada was too good.  The staff is very accommodating and on a recent visit was happy to help our large party out of the who-has-cash-and-who-brought-credit-cards jam by issuing separate checks. The ambiance is good, the music great without being distracting. Full disclosure, this CPK partnered with my store in our Earth Month fundraising with a dining out event. I'm sharing this not just so you know I'm interested in them doing well, but because I would encourage anyone who is looking to do a fundraising event to work with them.  If there's anything I'd have be different it pertains, as usual, to my own selfishness. I'd have them stay open a little later like some of the other restaurants at the Cherry Hill Mall. I'd love to unwind there, or bring home items from their wonderful takeout menu. Alas, with the exception of Sunday, they close at 9:30. Same time the mall closes.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=40
Amanda E.,"Pennsauken Township, United States",1,15,,4.0,24/8/2014,"I just went to California pizza kitchen for the first time and I have to say it was the best service I ever had. We walked in right after a huge birthday party of about 50 million kids, or so it seemed. Obviously we opted to sit outside. Instead of ignoring us like other restaurants would have, the hostess came out and explained the waiter was also sat with the large party and took our drink order - vodka clubs. It was obvious this was out of her expertise, but kudos to her for taking care of us. Then the manager came out to greet us and ask if we had any questions about the menu while we were waiting. Soon after our waiter came and took out order - white pizzas. They were pretty good but both pies were burnt at the bottom. Considering the immaculate service I'll assume that was a fluke. I'll definitely be going there again!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=40
Ryan K.,"Mickleton, United States",2,48,9,2.0,5/11/2013,Always a fan of CPK but last visit was just so disappointing.  They have changed up the menu which seems smaller in selections.  Not sure if it's just the Cherry Hill location but the change was clearly not for the better.  From our drinks to sandwiches in was a disappointing experience.  We did speak with the manager and apparently we are not alone in our thoughts.  If it ain't broke don't mess with it. CPK please come back with the old favorites.  Bring back the quality.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=40
Andy K.,"Gloucester City, United States",0,15,,2.0,4/11/2012,"Mmm...bland, flavorless, overpriced pizza and a waitress that came by twice after we placed our order until she delivered our check. Not worth the trip. My kids said they really liked their pizza, tho, which is why they got 2 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cherry-hill-2?start=80
