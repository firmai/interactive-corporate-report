12,Sam W.,"Kiel, WI",0,8,,1.0,2013-12-25,Poor service. Customers walking out. Employees bickering amongst themselves. It wasn't even busy from what I saw. Finally got our food after about 45 minutes waiting. My fish was swimming in grease. Burgers were cold but plates were on fire. Employees texting instead of working. All around one of the most chaotic restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. I'll add they did provide a gift certificate for the cost of our meal however I would never ever consider using it at this restaurant again. It's humorous to think that even a free meal isn't worth utilizing because I would consider McDonalds leaps and bounds above anything they could offer and I hate McDonalds.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
11,Brian M.,"Port Washington, WI",47,41,15.0,5.0,2014-06-29,"Fiesta lime chicken is good, but be careful,  the plate it's served on is 3000 degrees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
10,Elena O.,"Sheboygan, WI",8,8,,2.0,2014-08-21,"Service isn't great, waited for over half an hour just for appetizers. The restaurant wasn't even busy. Waitress never came back to see if we needed refills. Food was ok. Food was mostly warm but plate was super hot? I would not recommend trying this place..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
9,Adina K.,"Sheboygan, WI",24,38,4.0,1.0,2014-09-26,"Another miss with this Applebee's location. We ordered an appetizer sampler and it was very sad. We didn't have enough chips for the artichoke dip, our wings didn't have much sauce, the mozzarella stivks were terribly grease, and our quesadillas were very flat and disappointing. We also orderes the chili cheese nachos and there were huge chunks of meat all over. It was annoying to break that up before we could eat. Our waitress only gave us new drinks when we had asked for them and didn't genuinely seem to care about is as customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
8,Amanda V.,"De Pere, WI",0,3,,1.0,2015-01-24,Terrible service...we have been waiting for our food for over a half an hour and the table behind us ordered way after us and was served.  It was chicken tenders and shit common applebees,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
6,Junell H.,"St. Anne, IL",2,189,,3.0,2015-05-15,Food and beverages were good!  We enjoyed a late night snack but we're disappointed that some of the half price appetizers had been changed. We were Looking for sliders and pretzel sticks on the appetizer menu but they weren't there. Hopefully if enough people complain they will put them back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
7,Julie L.,"Cedar Grove, WI",37,37,8.0,3.0,2015-08-18,We ordered the all in bugers and they were really good. However one has a fried egg on top so I asked if it can be over easy and the waitress looked confused and said she didn't think cook could do it because it's a new menu item and they are not good at making eggs yet. Once it came out egg yolk was good. I asked for yellow mustard so the waitress went and got a bottle. The top of it was very dusty that the top of the bottle was dark in color because of all that dust. I wiped it off with my finger and the table next to ours made a comment. It was disgusting and her tip will reflect it. I'm sorry she couldn't miss it and when I said something she walked away. It doesn't take much to get a rag and wash it off before bringing it to your customers. That should be basic common sense!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
5,Pat G.,"Normal, IL",0,16,,1.0,2016-04-03,"Service so slow it took our party of 6 almost two hours to have lunch mid afternoon on a Sunday. The server was nice, explained they were short-handed. How short-handed do you have to be to take almost 2 hrs to serve drinks and simple entrees (no appetizers or desserts)??  The food itself was a mixed bag. Thai shrimp salad was nice and lite. The srichacha shrimp was terrible (""slightly sick to my stomach and still hungry""). Caesar salad was ""insubstantial "" but swimming in dressing.   Not a good value in terms of prices. Guess we will try the nearby Noodles next time we need an on/off quick bite in Sheboygan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
4,Bethanny R.,"Sheboygan, WI",0,9,1.0,1.0,2016-10-14,"Don't waste your time or money. Spent close to $50 for curbside to go. Instead of 15 minutes it took almost 30. All 3 steaks were cooked wrong, the garlicky green beans have zero flavor, just like the fire grilled veggies. Instead of the specialty burger we ordered we got a plain cheeseburger. The only good items were the appetizers. I won't be wasting my money here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
3,Santos V.,"Sheboygan, WI",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-05-06,If your waitress says her name is Katrina head straight to the bar ! Terrible service and left after 10 min of being there which was 5 min longer than we should have been there in the first place ..headed to Chilis instead,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
2,Marie C.,"Seattle, WA",0,138,15.0,5.0,2017-05-13,"Jenn my waitress was polite, welcoming and checked in with me several times. My glass was never empty and my food came out hot and fast. I ate in the bar area was exhausted after a 12 hour shift,  Recommend the extra crispy shrimp. Thank you for being top notch on service and food! I will return soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
1,Deb V.,"Oostburg, WI",0,16,,1.0,2017-12-10,"I am done with this location.  Wi-Fi never works, we sent out artichoke dip back 3 times because it was nice cold.  After the 3rd time we were told their microwaves were not working.  My salad came out with dressing on it, I asked for it on the side.  We were one of 5 occupied table's & out meal took 35 minutes!!  We were offered a free dessert, but nothing off our check for the horrible experience.  This was approx the 5th time I've been to this Applebees & it's worse every time.  My sister has lived in that area for 15 years & said the service is always horrible, but there are not a lot of options to eat out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
0,Gay Lynn B.,"Cascade, WI",8,1,1.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"This was our first dinner out in a long time. We came bwvaise someone gave me a gift card for my birthday. Service was good, food was decent. Hubby really enjoyed his whisky bacon burger & I liked the sweet chili dipping sauce for the AYCE chicken tenders. It was quiet tonight & we appreciated that after the hubbub of the holiday season.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sheboygan-3,,,,,
