A W.,"San Francisco, CA",226,555,39,5.0,1/4/2018,"It's rare that I visit a chain resto, but since I was in Fresno to meet a friend for lunch on New Year's Day it really was the only option.  I've always liked CPK, since back in the day I ate at the original WELL before it was a chain restaurant, in Beverly Hills. I love their pizzas, salads and other items I've tried, lately, esp. the drinks!  We wanted dessert but everything was just too heavy on the dairy for my lactose intolerance, so we had to pass.  What made it special though was we told our server who was great, we just wanted to sit and catch up.  Because it was a holiday and we were there very late, it was no problem, no one made us feel we had to get out and the service was stellar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno
Bonnie L.,"Downtown Berkeley, Berkeley, CA",249,14,32,4.0,12/25/2017,"I come here quite often whenever I'm in town. The service is okay but the food lives up to the CPK chain expectations. Typically you would not except to have a long wait to get a table.  Some go-to items I like to get are the spinach artichoke dip, Kung pao spaghetti and the Sicilian pizza. The dip is my favorite appetizer and they usually give you extra chips if you find there are leftovers at the end. I usually get the spaghetti without any meats because they don't give much and it costs extra. The Sicilian pizza comes on a thin crust and I believe they charge extra if you prefer to have a thicker crust. It comes with Italian sausages, basil and salami",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno
Misty A.,"Fresno, CA",91,25,12,3.0,11/5/2017,Really like the pasta and pizza here. Service is usually pretty nice (there was one time where it wasnt very busy and the server took about 30 minutes to take our drink order. We ordered water and left. We just didn't think it was worth it. Today unfortunately I ordered the Pesto Penne and added chicken. Not impressed. 5 pieces? Yeah. No.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno
Greg S.,"Fresno, CA",56,282,372,2.0,8/4/2017,"The service is good here but the food isn't. It looks and sounds great on the menu but I've yet to get anything here that has been decent. This last round was a take-out order of dumplings or potstickers. At over $10.00, I received 6 mushy, jelly fish like, dumplings. The filling was chicken because they don't have pork. It's was pee gravel grainy and not moist and juicy inside. The dipping sauce was the star here, sweet and wonderfully spicy. My last meal here was a rip, too. So much so that it inspired my last disappointing, ho-hum, review. California Pizza Kitchen: The idea is always better than the reality and because they essentially skimp on EVERYTHING, it's a place I will not bother with again. I'm not a cheap person but neither will I tolerate the weak offering here and the lousy value. Put some dang food on the plates! -G",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno
Nicola B.,"Fresno, CA",656,517,1232,3.0,7/5/2017,"Had a quick Friday afternoon lunch with a friend last week and had a pleasant enough experience. We arrived at 1pm and there were only 2 free tables - the place was absolutely packed. Maybe because schools are out for summer? We were seated right away but service was pretty slow. Our waitress was friendly and acknowledged how busy it was and that there'd been a wait, so she was realistic with us.  I'd had pizza a couple of nights beforehand, so I ordered a lunch combo - half chicken club sandwich, half superfood salad. My friend got the BBQ chicken salad which she's had a few times and enjoys. My meal was filling - the superfood salad has some quinoa, walnuts, spinach, and cranberries. The sandwich was on a brioche roll, really sweet, it was sweeter than I usually enjoy but since it was just a half sandwich it balanced nicely with the salty bacon. Total with an iced tea and tip was $17 - more than I'd usually spend on lunch. It reminded me that this place is here and has pretty good food, though, so I'll probably come back for a pizza sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno

Portion sizes were good, everyone found something to eat and cleared their plates. At that time it was a ghost town but they do not take reservations so plan accordingly. I ordered a mojito which was fine but sprigs of mint would have been preferable to the diced within an inch of its life mint.

Joel G.,"Fresno, CA",16,66,16,2.0,12/3/2014,"I've never understood this place. I mean back in the 90's when it was a cool business model to put a new hip spin on an old classic, Starbucks you're my Rachel, and CPK you're my Ross. CPKs food is basically over priced flatbread and horrible salads. I don't care you have a bar. Not much going on here.  Much like the TV show Friends, CPK has not aged well with its white button ups tucked into their jeans like they're competing with Ellen in a mom pants contest. To refer back, Rachel and Starbucks you went on to become more relevant and seductive over the years. CPK, you are a bit of a dinosaur just waiting for a meteor to completely crater your business. One day a Jewish paleontologist from New York named Ross will unearth you and declare you permanently extinct while sipping from a warm hot cup of arabica Rachel goodness. I wish CPK nothing but failure and perhaps the restaurant space will one day be filled with something worthy of that elite corner location like say another Starbucks.  Nothing personally to the staff as they are kind and friendly enough. I doubt they'll have a hard time finding another restaurant gig in river park. There are as many restaurants to choose from in River Park as there are triple-bypass patients at the heart hospital up the street. And as anyone knows service skills are easily transferable. As longs as the patrons keep coming, and the doors stay open don't listen to me CPK staff. But honestly it's flat bread, have some pride. It's a one trick pony. Without sauces you've got nothing...just saying. Three stars for service, minus one for food. Total, 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=40

Wenwen Y.,"Clovis, CA",3,3,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Please read this! This is a fatal warning. I'm very disappointed. Really. We got the take-out, since my mom was too busy to cook. We ordered three pizzas and the Kung-pao chicken spaghetti. Horrible service. We ordered the food, and waited at a nearby empty nearby booth. We couldn't sit in the waiting area because there were people sitting there already. We waited for about 20 minutes and the waitress behind the counter still didn't call our name. The people sitting in the waiting area left, so we moved there. We waited for a couple more minutes, and my mom went up to the waitress and asked if they were done with our food. The waitress asked for our name and checked a shelf under the counter in front of her. It turns out that the food had been sitting there for about 15 minutes. The waitress argued that since we weren't sitting at the waiting area, she didn't call our name. My mom told her that there were people sitting left and we moved there. The waitress just shrugged and didn't even offer a ""sorry"". My mom asked for some utensils and she only gave us one pack, even though we ordered three pizzas and one spaghetti. When we were leaving, the waitress caught up to us and put three small cups of sauce into the bag and said she forgot to give them to us. When we got home, we found out that she didn't place the cups right side up and were leaking all over the bag. The bag was stained with oil.

Michele A.,"Clovis, CA",0,23,,2.0,6/14/2016,"My mom and I go to to CPK often and usually have great service. I went with a few people for a special occasion yesterday, including my mom. It took a long time just to order, and we saw our server walking back and forth, not making eye contact with us...and with two small kids that was hard to just sit and wait that long...just to order. Then we all ordered our food and it took a long time to get our food...we ordered basically all salads and soups...cant take that long to plate. The kids orders came back great...besides that, everything was wrong..we had to send a few things back and or deal with the mistake and say nothing because it just wasn't worth it. My mother is allergic to cheese and she asked for ranch, specifically ranch, no blue cheese on her salad and they brought out blue cheese, on the salad. She gagged at the table and I told the waitress the issue and the manager came over, with her hands in the air, and said,"" I can guarantee you this is ranch, okay??"" And put the salad back in front of her... We were stunned the attitude from this manager, who normally is very nice. A few minutes later she came back with a change of attitude saying, ""oh you know what, ill have them remake it just in case there is more cheese in there...""  After that, the waitress was more attentive with our refills on tea and bread but before that, she was basically non existent.  I asked for separate tabs and all the tabs were on one tag, and it took about 20 min to just get the card back to sign the receipt.   It was ridiculous, the lunch was ruined and the service was horrible.

VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",63,624,11989,4.0,10/6/2014,"The pizza here is great...you really cant go wrong. I have been a CPK fan for many years and was here yesterday to get a sick relative something to eat.  Instead of getting my order to-go, I decided to dine in. The hostess was in an almost zombie like state, she took us to our table, laid the menus down and muttered something about wanting to eat my brains...I kid, I kid. I don't have brains, lol. She did not tell me about the specials, she just laid the 'specials' menu down. She never once said who my server was, enjoy my meal or anything.  My waitress was good, but a little on the slow side. I asked for a refill on my soda and it took her over 10 min to come back. She was even slow with the table behind me, and they ended up being compensated for that...that's how slow she was. Unfortunately I was not compensated ;( Anyways, my server was great to tell me about the specials and their current promotions. Right now if you sign up for their e-mail membership, you get a FREE small plate app. You can either register online or on the card in house. For my free app, I opted for the Fried Mac n Cheese. It did not come out the way in which my server described, so I was kind of bummed. It was four tiny little fried balls with a little bit of cheese sauce. I do have to say, the panko breading was REALLY crispy and good. The mac n cheese tasted like Velveeta, which isn't bad if you like Velveeta. The cheese had a really generic flavor, I expected more from CPK since they are all 'gourmet' and fancy. I personally would not order them again. For my main entrée I went with the crowd favorite...BBQ Chicken Pizza. It was served piping hot within minutes after I ordered it, and was brought to me by the Chef himself...perhaps he knew that my server was slower than a snail and didn't want my food getting cold. The pizza was near perfection. There was an abundance of toppings from the cilantro, onions, chicken all the way to the BBQ sauce. The dough was super warm and had a nice crisp to it. Only complaint about the dough was that it tasted a tad too salty. The atmosphere has changed over the years, not sure for the better. The pizza prices continue to climb, but the service and ambience have been going down. They used to have your silverware wrapped in a black cloth napkin, and now you get it rolled in a generic brown paper napkin. You no longer get bread and butter when seated, you have to request it. They also took some good menu items away. All in all it is a decent experience and I quite possibly will return, but with so many other options in town it may be a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=20
Audra S.,"Clovis, CA",71,132,997,5.0,2/8/2015,"THE best gluten-free pizza I've EVER had, even better than BJ's Restaurant! The rice-flour crust was soft but not mushy, with excellent flavor. The tomato sauce was sweet and slightly spicy. The cheese was VERY stretchy; the real deal. I like the chunks of fresh basil and tomatoes, too (we got the Margharetta).  I like their GF appetizer options; the wedge salad had a sweet dressing offset by the rich bleu cheese and bacon. My friend got the corn-and-black-bean guacamole; I could try it because the mole itself is GF, but the chips are fried in a cross-contaminated fryer. The chewy corn gives texture to the creamy avocado, and the flavor of each ingredient is expressed.  My server, Lindsay, was attentive and quick, even when asking her lots of safety questions.  TOTALLY recommend this restaurant to the GF community--and everyone!

Cole S.,"Fresno, CA",0,11,1,4.0,2/5/2016,"This is probably one of the better inexpensive chain restaurants in the area. It's not gourmet, but you always know what you're going to get--and fortunately, what you get usually tastes pretty good. The dining area is bright and clean, and the employees seem well-trained and friendly. I've dined at this location multiple times as well as ordered takeout, and I've never had any major complaints. The last time I ate there I tried a shrimp alfredo and found the sauce a bit too watery and that the tails were left on the shrimp, which I'm not a fan of in pasta dishes. You're probably best just sticking to the pizzas; my go-to is the BBQ Chicken. Apparently there are some healthier options available on the menu as well, if that's your thing. I'd probably rank their customer service four stars but their food just a three.

We had one guest who was running late and Kelly was very sweet and said he could push the tour 5 min. to wait four our last arrival. He then gave the kids a very fun Q&A tour.

Drew W.,"Clovis, CA",0,9,,2.0,10/3/2013,"Things that happened at CPK last night: 1)  We came in a large party (14+).  A few folks in our party ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti, but one person ordered it without peanuts.  The food took a long time to arrive, and when it did one of the servers messed up and gave the no-peanuts Kung Pao to the wrong person, who already started eating it so it was too late to swap.  Oddly enough, the server didn't tell the person who got the no-peanuts Kung Pao that their dish didn't have peanuts and just assumed that they would be OK with it.  To make matters worse, apparently they ran out of spaghetti so they had to remake the dish (which already took too long to come out) without peanutes and with a different type of pasta.  To make matters even worse, the restaurant didn't even have the decency to offer some kind of discount for their screw up.  They charged full price. 2)  I had ordered the 2 for $30 deal and nothing else.  When the bill came, it was $50.  When I asked the server why my bill was so high, her automatic response was, ""oh it's tax and tip,"" which, obviously, uh no.  I told her I don't think she charged us right, she eventually agreed and took the bill to her manager.  So bill #2 comes back and this time it's around $40, with a $7 tip, which amounts to a ~21% tip even if the tip was calculated after tax.  Evidently, the only thing the server changed was the base price of the meal and she didn't recalculate her 18% gratuity based on the lower price.  So the tip was calculated based on the incorrect higher price from the first bill.  Ultimately, the second bill overcharged me by about a dollar.  For a half second I thought about whether I should send the bill back AGAIN, but eventually just let it slide since she already demonstrated a deficiency in math so she probably didn't do it on purpose.  Enjoy your extra dollar (hopefully on a math book). I have to give CPK some credit for having decent tasting food, huge portions and reasonable prices (when they charge you correctly).  However, yesterday's service was pretty bad so IMO there's no reason to go unless someone else in your group is really craving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=80

I also think the location has some factor on the price, it's a nice part of town so obviously it's a little bit more. The waitress I had was so sweet and caring, she had a great personality and wasn't forcing anything on us, that's a rare trait. I really like how attentive everyone is at this restaurant, I'll see the managers talking to tables and taking the kids into the kitchen to flip dough and what place does that besides Cpk? NO WHERE.

I ordered a salad tonight and clearly said NO AVOCADO. I had a long day and just got home to eat my salad. Imagine my shock when it was full of avocado. I called the restaraunt, that is now closed, and told the girl who answered about the salad. She got a manager on the phone. I was polite but not happy. She must have been having a bad night because there was no apology at all and the first thing she said was ""what do you want me to do about it""? After I recovered from being taken aback from this question I said I would come in tomorrow and get the correct salad. She said she couldn't do that, that she would have to either send me something in the mail or reverse the charges. I told her to reverse the charges. When she looked up the order she said I did ask for avocado. No...that was my sons. After enduring her tone I asked her if she was upset with me, because it sure did seem that way. Then I got the lecture. It was at this point I realized she didn't care and I just wanted the call over with. She reversed the charges on my card, I hung up. As a very regular customer I find this so disappointing. My food allergy is very serious and I have always appreciated the extra care CPK seemed to take when it came to this. I guess I would have expected the management to at least act like they cared and not treated me in such a manner. Pretty sure they can look back in their records and see this is the same order, pretty much every time, and I have ordered this A LOT.

When we arrived at 7pm, it was a typical Friday night: busy.  We waited a brief 20 minutes outside and were seated promptly.  Being a party of two meant quicker seating at one of the many 1x1 booths. Five stars so far. (We did notice that when we were seated an overwhelming number of tables hadn't been cleared which was contributing to the long delay) One seated, we waited several minutes before getting menus and drink orders.  The unsettling part is the waitress who eventually served us had passed by multiple times.  A simple ""I'll be right with you guys"" would've gone a long way. -0.5 stars When we placed our drink order, we also ordered the corn guacamole from the small plates menu.  We both enjoyed everything about it.  Still no drinks. -1.0 stars We ordered a cobb salad on romaine with blue cheese dressing & beets, five cheese and fresh tomato pizza and two cups of soup; the soup is what the Mrs was craving the most.  The waitress asked if we would like the soup first to which we confirmed.  After a surprisingly short wait the food arrived and the drinks soon followed.  We asked about the soup and the gentleman said he would check.  He ended up bringing only one cup at our request.  The pizza was great and the salad was fresh.  However, the salad was coated with ranch, not blue cheese.  We also had to ask for utensils.  -0.5 stars for each.

Cece C.,"Merced, CA",0,17,18,5.0,8/2/2015,"After coming back from a trip to New York and Brooklyn I understood what good pizza should taste like. I came here with my two young kids. They each ordered their kids pizza and I ordered a lunch special which was a mushroom and spinach personal pizza with a chicken Caesar salad. They also brought us warm bread with warm olive oil and basil--- so delicious. The pizza crust was thin, light and airy- the way real pizza should be! You can tell they are using real dough, not frozen. And I've also been to Italy where they make pizza this way. Ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. Needless to say, we ate everything and my kids each finished their pizzas as well (which they can never quite finish anything). I definitely recommend this place and will be coming back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60
Karen P.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,2,4.0,6/1/2015,"We wanted to ride our bikes to a restaurant that has a patio so we could keep an eye on them while eating. We choose CPK because of this. We had the patio to ourselves which was surprising as the evening was very pleasant. We were promptly seated and our waiter, Mikey, greeted us immediately and took our drink orders. He personally made our Long Island ice teas which, for the first time anywhere, were every bit as delicious as TGIF's recipe. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza which was cooked perfectly. Mikey was an outstanding waiter and was attentive without being overly so. CPK was smart to hire him. The only reason I did not give this establishment a 5 star rating is that the patio was in desperate need of a deep cleaning, mainly the tile floor needs a good streaming to erase all of the unappealing stains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60
Michelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,109,33,3.0,6/16/2011,"3.5, to be exact. The handful of times that I've eaten at CPK, I've actually really enjoyed it. If you're looking for something different from your traditional pizza, then this spot is definitely up for suggestion. Also, I DO love the fact that the food is somewhat lighter than your average. I can still breathe after inhaling an entire order of pizza, and not leave feeling like oily goodness is seeping through my pores. Or is that just me? I have yet to try a pizza or salad that I don't like here; however, maybe this place is just too commercial for me (who knows?) because it's never a place I PERSONALLY choose. Perhaps it may be the the lack of service. My customer service experiences with Fresno's have been somewhat subpar - not that any of the waiters or waitresses are rude - just not very attentive, I guess. Whatever the case, no complaints here food-wise (in reference to all CPK's in general).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60
Samantha P.,"Fresno, CA",1,1,,4.0,7/29/2014,Great Gluten Free pizza! Staff was nice and we didn't wait too long. I have to be cautious of where I eat as I can get sick from gluten. Had a good experience and will be going again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60

You could either say the portions are a little small for the price or the prices are a little on the high side for what you get hah. Service is good - the servers have always been very friendly/accommodating, and sometimes exceptional.  Sometimes it does take longer than I would like to get food but I enjoy my dining experience enough to come back frequently.

Latosha L.,"Fresno, CA",323,136,289,3.0,7/18/2011,"The pizza here is good but average. It was really nothing special to me and is overpriced, in my opinion. If you come here, make sure it's for the atmosphere and fun experience, not for amazing pizza. I had the fully loaded ""combination"" pizza (I guess you could call it) and it was pretty good, the veggies were fresh and everything tasted as expected. The food came out quick and hot, and the portions are ok...good for 1 to 2 people.  I also had the mango and strawberry mojotos, which were pretty tasty but the bartender took forever and a day to make my drinks. I waited like 15 minutes for my drink to come once the waitress took my order and the bar was dead! So there was no excuse for the service to take as long as it did. Thats my only real gripe about this place. The customer service was good and the workers were friendly. The restaurant was extremely clean and well organized, which I loved. I'd come back just for a little lunch with a group of friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno?start=60

They said they could sit us at 2 tables. I didn't say it, but our family isn't able to get together much. We are all in town because my Nonno passed away. Kind of important for us to sit together.

I guess I'm ambivalent about this place. I'd wouldn't be my first choice for pizza, even though Fresno hasn't really proven to me that it's a pizza town. Having said all that, I like their pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza on their honey wheat crust. Again, I seem to be getting better service in Fresno than K.I. which is kinda weird.

Brian M.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/4/2011,They offer a wide range of specialty pizzas. I my favorite is the original BBQ chicken pizza. Their pizzas range from $12-$18 which is very pricey when they are the size of a Me-N-Eds personal pizza. Besides their pizzas they also offer many different pastas and salads.  Since it is located in River Park you have to realize your paying more for the nicer atmosphere compared to a pizza parlor. It is a classy place and is fun to go with a group or a date. My waiters have always done an exceptional job and their is usually only a five minute wait to be seated.
