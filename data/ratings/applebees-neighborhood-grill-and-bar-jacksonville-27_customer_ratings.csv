5,Jared J.,"Lincoln, NE",0,2,,1.0,2014-08-13,"Worst Applebees meal I've ever had. I ordered a sirloin with mashed potatoes. The steak was rubbery and tasted like it was microwaved.  The ""garlic mashed potatoes"" tasted like instant potatoes. Awful meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
3,Chelsea A.,"Albany Park, Chicago, IL",97,38,9.0,2.0,2014-11-27,"I have gone here a few times with my family when I home to visit them. Usually there's something wrong with the food or I feel that my meal was not as good as it could have been. The service has, for the most part been fine, though.  If you're hanging out on or near Morton, want a sit-down meal, and don't have time/don't want to go to the downtown area, I would say go here only then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
0,Emily D.,"Edmond, OK",0,14,,5.0,2015-05-23,My family has really loved all of their food! The service has been outstanding. Very nice Applebee's. It appears to be clean. Service was quick and accurate as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
4,Lisa N.,"Crystal Lake, IL",4,8,,5.0,2015-06-17,"I can't say anything about their food, but the rating is mainly for Alex in the bar. We were trying to cool off in between baseball games/waiting out thunderstorms at Lenz Fields. We took over the bar and Alex served all of us (12 15U players, 4 siblings, 13 parents) quickly and accurately. He was able to separate bills by family. Made a fantastic Fireball Whiskey Lemonade. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
2,Carl H.,"Vienna, VA",1,13,1.0,2.0,2016-05-11,"Definitely a bad showing from Applebee's. It took 10 min to get a table, not because they were crowded but because they didn't have staff to clear tables. Once we were seated it took the waitress 3 tries to remember our drink order (a beer, jack and coke, rum and coke). 15 minutes to get the beer because they didn't have any clean glasses. The appetizers were pretty solid, wings could've used more sauce though. Our party of three order the steak (medium) and Parmesan shrimp, a grilled chicken breast, and a blazin' Texan burger with sweet potato fries. The steak came out overcooked by about 20 min with no shrimp. Their solution was to bring out a plate of shrimp with the sauce and swap the steak off the plate. The chicken breast was drier than California right now. The burger that came out was the brunch burger with sweet potato fries. Once the correct burger was brought out half of the fries were gone. Needless to say the whole time there were people waiting to sit simply because there was no staff to seat them. We were shocked they didnt comp anything, but I guess that's why it's the lowest of the casual restaurant chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
1,Russell Corky M.,"Las Vegas, NV",72,1,,2.0,2017-02-21,I eat at Applebee's about 10 times a year and I am never dissatisfied with my meal until tonight. I used their carry out service and that will not happen again (if I go back). My sirloin was ordered medium rare and there isn't any pink what so ever and it was as tough as leather. My garlic mashed potatoes had dried crust on top indicating they had been in the container for quite sometime. I received no bread or dinner roll.  Very disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jacksonville-27,,,,,
