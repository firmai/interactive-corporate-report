Noelle J.,"San Jose, CA",559,881,11402,3.0,12/29/2017,"Noelle's Yelp Notebook 2017 My husband, son and I dined here a few weeks ago. We came on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all. Customer service was friendly and accommodating from start to finish. We ordered the following: Pretzel Bites appetizer (3.5/5) Kids cheese pizza (4/5) Red's Tavern Double Burger (3.5/5) Crispy Chicken Salad (4/5) Kids milkshake (4/5) One soda One iced tea  Slice of Mud Pie (4/5) The pretzels bites weren't bad but the cheese that accompanied it was a tad on the salty side. The kids Pizza was freshly made and my son seemed to like enjoy it. My husband ordered the burger and said it was okay. I had the crispy chicken salad which was delish but there was at least a cups worth of wilted pieces- just as a side note this is very large. The slice of mud pie was super large and delish but too big for two people, we didn't finish it at all. This is a decent spot to eat at when heading to the Gilroy Outlets. I don't recommend waiting if there is a line out the door- because the food is just okay. Our bill was $50.20 before tip, so after it was said and done our bill was closer to $60. Noelle's Notes Overpriced and just okay tasting food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill
Astrid D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,52,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"I feel bad giving it such a low rating since the service, the hostess and waitress were so nice and accommodating but the food is TERRIBLE. Later after eating here, me my husband and son got sick. The food also looks bad and presentation is lazy. The burgers look and taste everything but gourmet.  We've visited many other locations and always loved it so we ended up very disappointed after our visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill

Travis N.,"Pleasanton, CA",454,20,3,2.0,1/2/2018,"My wife and I finished a long day riding dirt bikes and wanted a delicious burger. She ordered a chicken sandwich that she enjoyed and I got a ""Smokey bacon cheddar"" something burger.. sounds delish right? The lettuce was half turned and the burger was dry as could be. Their bartender was good but spread way too thin. I could tell by the heat off my plate it was sitting in the window for a long time. They took a long time to reach the table. All and all, I'm skipping this place from now on. They are consistent. Consistently bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill
Eric S.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,18,1,2.0,1/8/2018,"Food is usually pretty good, can't go wrong with any of their burgers. However, I've come a handful of times where the service is REALLY SLOW.

Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",110,158,287,4.0,9/17/2017,I decided to come here bc I was too lazy to cook and I had a 21% off to go orders coupon. I arrived a few minutes early so I went inside to wait. The eye candy bartender was a major treat. I think I would come in just to watch him like one would repeatedly return to a store to stare longingly at a Hermès bag that they want but can't have. The food was nicely packaged and ready even before the estimated time.  I ordered the smoky tavern burger and upgraded to poutine fries. I went home and started with the fries. I enjoyed the saltiness of the cheese curds with the garlic aioli and gravy. The flavors blended so well together. I don't think I can eat their fries any other way now. I'm not sure I'd order the cheese curds alone because smaller pieces were more breading that cheese. They were very filling. 5 stars The burger just didn't deliver like the sriacha double tavern I had a couple weeks ago. The BBQ sauce was delicious but needed more. The pepper jack cheese though I love didn't really do it for me. There was no heat. No savory taste. I think corporate needs to go back to the drawing board with this one. At least there was ranch in the bag that I could dip the burger in to enhance the taste. 3 stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill
September R.,"San Jose, CA",126,44,2,2.0,11/27/2017,"Yet another swing and a miss. Previously we have gone here and I've had poor service, but this time was an epic fail.  I ordered a burger with ""sauce on the side, no pickles, tomatoes or raw onions, but I still want the onion strings on it."" At any other restaurant, this is a normal request. However, my burger came without any sauce, produce of any kind, and none of the onion strings or other things that should have been on it. Picture a plain patty of meat with a slice of cheese melted on top.  I requested the onion strings and sauces, but only got onion strings.  I'm tired of going to this place and having my order messed up. I eat on a very controlled diet, and very rarely want a burger, but when I do, I want a great burger. Next time, I will not go there. :(  (This isn't the first time!)  I'm giving 2 stars because they actually brought us fries a couple of times... which doesn't always happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill
Wendy R.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/22/2017,"Really wish I had read the reviews before I came here! I came because my friend who lives in another city says that Red Robin has the best fish and chips. And they might have been okay if they weren't cold. The Long Island iced tea, on the other hand, was the worst! All it tasted like was a lemonade.

America Y.,"Redwood City, CA",5,5,,1.0,9/27/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. Went to a Red Robin in another town after finding it on the Find Me Gluten Free app. Celiacs runs in my family, and I get extremely ill when exposed to gluten. After going to the one in San Bruno, I knew the deal and knew what to do... I thought.   As a chain, I had increased trust becaude they have a higher legal stake from being largescale. I have been to Red Robin before in another city very recently so I knew how the process this time. First I asked the hostess for the gluten free menu. The hostess instead argued with me that they don't have one. When I mentioned the previous Red Robin, she argued more and tried handing me the nutritional menu (which only shows calories). I told her to ask her manager about the gluten free menu, and she STILL argued about it until I demanded that she ask for it. Lo and behold, the gluten free menu does exist. Anyways, the waitress was very outgoing but wouldn't stop talking about my gluten problem. She kept mentioning not ever hearing about it until the last few years (my aunt was diagnosed over 30 years ago, but okay, sure. It's brand new). She basically made me her teacher, and while I was willing to explain, it was altogether uncomfortable. Anyways, she wrote Celiac on the ticket and took my order. The food took a while to come out and when it did I started eating it. About half way through something seemed off. I opened it up, and sure enough there were breaded fried jalapenos in there. I'm not the kind of person to demand a manager or demand a refund, but I expect the waitress to take it seriously after the restaurant POISONS a customer with an allergen. This is a legal issue. No manager came by, and no discount was given for the meal. The waitress LITERALLY said ""Just BELIEVE that you won't get sick!"" As I write this, the migraine and stomach problems are already creeping in. I feel awful and I will be feeling awful for at least a couple days. I don't get to BELIEVE I won't get sick. It is my biology. I'm lucky to only have a gluten problem. If I had an anaphylaxis inducing allergy to something I would be in the hospital tonight instead of just having to call in to work and school. I will not be eating at any Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill
John W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",4,28,2,1.0,11/26/2017,"Just plain horrible service. You'll be lucky to get a second serving of ""bottomless"" fries within 20 minutes of actually finishing your whole meal. I honestly feel like the management here intentionally does this so that you get less food and the get more profit.

Keira P.,"Morgan Hill, CA",69,13,2,1.0,11/10/2017,Really bad service! The endless fries are not endless because they never bring them! We are not coming back.

Svenne R.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,26,7,1.0,8/2/2017,"I have been a Red Robin fanatic for years. Went to the Morgan Hill location while in town for a tournament. Wait was normal for a Saturday.  The host (Anthony) seated us, and I requested if they could put on the local Fox station, because there was a UFC event on that afternoon. Anthony did, and all was good...ordered our drinks and apps.  2 out of 3 drinks are brought, (ran out of the draft I ordered) no big deal, I ordered something else. We order our main, and went to town on our onion rings. Server never asked how we'd like our burgers cooked, so I pray and hope it comes out ok. Finish our o-rings, and our burgers arrive about 10 minutes later. Burger is cooked all the way through, yet the cheese hasn't melted onto the meat. As if they cooked off 100 patties earlier, and just nuked them later. Burger is cold, cheese is goeey, and the fries are cold and almost soggy.  Server was nowhere to be seen for about 15 minutes...so I didn't have a chance to bring it to her attention. Halfway into our burgers, Anthony comes over with the remote, and changes the channel. With 3 other TV's, I asked him why he changed the channel. His response was ""my manager told me it's a corporate policy, not to broadcast it"" Being a bit annoyed, and dissatisfied, we left in a hurry. I forgot my Oakley sunglasses, and my Patriots hat I wore. So the following morning, we stopped by on our way out of town to collect those items. Girl at the hostess stand, tells us that the items are nowhere to be found. My guess is, the busser grabbed the Oakleys, and tossed the hat. A few days later, I reached out to Red Robin Corp, and asked if there was a policy against showing boxing, or MMA - apparently there isn't one. The manager just had her panties in a bunch, and deemed it inappropriate for adults of age to watch. I've been to at least a dozen different RR's, and luckily I live FAR away from Morgan Hill. So chances are slim, that I'll ever visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill

I mean, for being just a red Robin joint in a outdoor strip mall, I was definitely impressed here. Friendly host greeted promptly upon entering. We were seated within 5min. Serving staff happily waited on us for drink orders in just under 5min ...all smiles and politeness. We had our 3yr old and the server easily accomidated sooner than later bites for our son to snack on while waiting. our food came accordingly but timely  what was awesome was the constant check in on us and drink refill ...u don't get that at all in some places.

Almost all the tables needed clearing and stayed like that throughout our visit.  We wanted wings. All out.  Ordered two drinks. Did not come. After about 15 minutes, had to go to the bar and ask. Ordered dinner. Delivered salad for one dinner and burger for the other. Very skimpy fries with the burger. Salad not tossed so dressing in a puddle in the middle. When dinners delivered no silverware. Asked. Took 5 min to arrive and when it did waiter had glasses of water in his hands and silverware under his arm pit. No kidding in his armpit.

I was fine with that but when we went to pay the bill he had overcharged us by $10. Sure, it was a mistake but he certainly didn't deserve a tip. Other restaurants would probably say more than just sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=60

Our server was super nice and gave me lots of bottomless fries and my bottomless strawberry limeade arrived quickly. I ordered the Banzai burger & ate the whole thing! It was delicious! So sweet and savory with every bite and the meat was super juicy along with the pineapple slices that topped everything off.

Jonathan G.,"Newman, CA",18,15,14,1.0,10/30/2016,"I would like to tell my story about this particular Red Robin. I have always been a huge fan of Red Robin. I love their food and mostly their friendly staff. We were visiting some family in Morgan Hill and we decided to grab a late lunch/early dinner. We arrived at Red Robin and greeted by the host immediately. We were seated in less than 5 minutes. Shortly after being seated our original waitress addressed us stating that she was told to go home because she was on overtime. Meanwhile, we still weren't asked what we wanted to drink. Our new server was introduced and again failed to take our drink order until we asked her. She ended up taking our kids order so they didn't get impatient . However, the service went to crap from there. We were sitting for another 10 minutes or so before we finally told her we are ready to order and she rolled our eyes. At this point our order was placed and we were patiently waiting for our food. While waiting for our food another waitress was sticking her hand down her pants scratching her bum. We were all disgusted with this behavior. Thankfully, she was not our waitress. Our waitress arrived with our food shortly after the previous incident. While 3/4 of our party received their food the other 2 did not and she apologized and had the kitchen get the orders out asap. This is were it got interesting. My sibling and his wife received cold chicken sandwiches as well as mayonnaise which they didn't ask for (not a big deal). Well, I bit into my sandwich and I bit into a big long blond hair. I literally almost threw up on the table. We immediately asked for the manager and we had to ask 4 different waiters before she came over. She asked what the problem was and I aggressively told her that I had a hair in my food. She told me to calm down and not be aggressive. I asked her what she would do if she bit into a piece of hair? Guess what? Crickets!!!! We told her that we just wanted to leave and she became irritated and started rolling her eyes telling us just to leave. This behavior is not tolerable at all and she didn't try to rectify the issue at hand. I believe the way she managed the situation was her poor and she should not be working with the public. I have to say, I am not the one to complain; however, this was not acceptable nor will I ever be back to a Red Robin again. I will spend my money elsewhere. I will be writing a letter to the corporate office to tell my story. Thank you for reading my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=60

Red Robin, here we go! Getting seated was fairly quick; however, everything that followed was slow and executed poorly. Took 20 minutes before our waitress (name removed) got our orders. It took another 20 minutes for the food to come out. My friend and I each ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger (which was cold by the time it arrived) and ate some of it and noticed it didn't taste right. We waved down our waitress and explained that our burgers were missing its signature ingredient--Bleu cheese! She stared at the burgers and shook her head in disapproval. Instead of saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry"", she appeared to be annoyed as she said, ""hold up, I'll get you some Bleu cheese. What the hell? My friend took action into his own hands and grabbed both of our plates to another waitress for two newly made Bleu Ribbon burgers.  Oh, and the ""bottomless fries""? I got gray hair just waiting for a refill to replenish your eaten fries. Technically, it is ""bottomless"" so long as you have the superhuman patience to wait for their service.

After much grief I approached the hostess who sent over the manager. The manager served the rest of our food, got us more fries and drink refills and ultimately took care of our entire meal.  This manager said that she coached this server and that she is fairly new, and my family thinks that this server should let customers know she's new to the restaurant. It would inspire more sympathy.

The silverware I was given, not wrapped so there is no excuse, was utterly disgusting. Greasy with drops of something sticky all over it. The plate I just ate off also looks like it was never washed, and for god sakes their beer selection sucks ass. I recommend shying from this RR. Leaving disgusted.

Big place so no issues getting seated either.  Having said that, the place wasn't anything remarkable. We had to wait quiet a bit for the check. Probably because it was late in the the night and there was just one guy taking orders. Nevertheless, was a long wait. Besides, the cutlery wasn't too clean.

Alexandra S.,"San Jose, CA",8,1,1,2.0,9/19/2014,"I'm not exactly sure where to start with this one. The service was alright, I mean it was busy so that part I understand. But you should make sure your patrons have at least utensils, that's pretty essential if you ask me. Secondly I ordered the culls an shrimp; I've ordered this before at a red robin in Vacaville and it was really good there. Here- not so much. It comes to the table the shrimp looks Unappealing and you can tell by first glance it was cooked in extremely unclean oil. Plus there were only 5 small pieces and two chicken strips; if I remember correctly the one in Vacaville came with more- it was actually worth 12 dollars. This one was not. Not at all.  Now when the manager came over, he didn't  exactly help either. I said I didn't want it several times and yet he insisted to take it off the bill and get me more strips. That wasn't the point. I did not want it. And he did not listen because awhile later he comes back with more strips.  Thankfully though another, (what I believe to be) manager came over. He was much easier to work with and actually listened and got us everything the other manager & waitress did not. Sadly I don't know his name but he was probably the only reason I have two stars. Though! I found it awfully rude that when the second manager was speaking to is for the first time the second manager came over and told him not to bug us even though he was doing a lot more good than the first one ever did.

Elle M.,"Gilroy, CA",16,93,,1.0,9/15/2014,"I don't come here expecting 5 star anything when it comes to a fast food place. I would be happy coming here, knowing that it is a solid 3 stars. Not today and not in the past either. We were pleasantly greeted and seated right away. Server came out, sort of quiet but pleasant as well. We ordered our drinks, and she quickly came back with the kids but ours were still being filled at the bar. Fine. She came back, without the drinks and took our order. After 10+ minutes of taking our drink order, they finally arrive AFTER reminding her that we were still waiting. Beer was coldish, wine was warmish. Husband got a wedge salad which was not fresh. The lettuce appeared to have been cut since morning as the edges were dry. The outer leaves were limp, the other problem was that the dressing was on the outer leaf which was inedible. Husband asked for more dressing and we never got it. We told the server we would not be paying for the salad. She never apologized and just said okay,  We all got our food, the kids were happy with theirs, husband got fish and chips which were what he expected and I got a chicken sandwich and ordered the fruit for the side. All I got was a chicken sandwich in the basket, no fruit, wilted produce and an onion with the skin still on. Peel the onion. Simple. The server noticed that my basket looked missing so she brought me out some fries. 12 of them, they were warmish and I think she took them off of another table who already picked over the good ones. Terrible. None of our food was hot or fresh tasting, it was dying at the window and no one picked it up on time. It was basically one of those meals where you go home hoping that no one gets food poisoning. I will not be coming back. Even if I get a gift card. Blech! I will not be coming back to Red Robin in Morgan Hill, Chili's, Chevy's and Famous Dave's in Gilroy.

She told us she needed to ask her manager & we were okay with that. When she came back she not only was giving us attitude but started arguing with us. She then told us the manager approved the passport and my friend could order a drink, but she told us she wasn't going to allow it. It was an experience that definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth & it wasn't something we expected at all. Since she became rude and argumentative we no longer wanted to stay and eat there seeing as she was the only waitress so we decided to leave.

Luisa L.,"Gilroy, CA",0,9,5,1.0,11/26/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for a burger a few weeks back and had the worst experience. The hostess told us the bar area was open seating if seating was available in there. We looked for a table which there were 6 but ALL of them were dirty. We asked if one could be clean and she said the busser was busy and continued on her phone. We walked around the bar area to see if one had gotten cleaned but no. During this time staff is just passing us by and passing all these dirty tables by, while other guest are waiting to sit in the bar as well. Finally the busser gets to them, he was probably the only one in there working hard that night. I ordered a root beer and decided I wanted a root beer float instead so the waitress who is also the bartender brought me a cup of ice cream to pour my root been into, other waiters see it spilling all over as I'm trying to pour it and don't even offer napkins as I'm trying to clean it with only one. It took forever to get our order taken, food to come out, and to get any assistance from our waitress since she was also busy at the bar. The waiters who were in the bar area saw out red light on and just walked past our table with the ""that's not my table"" attitude. The food came out and was cold and just thrown together. Our waitress never came around to ask for refills or more fries on the so called bottomless. I can continue to complain about staff but at the end of the day this review falls on the management. If there is a need they should be there to make sure it is met. No manager was anywhere to be found to make sure the restaurant was running smoothly and the guest were happy.

The waitress laughed at me and said no. I don't know what's so funny about wanting a non-alcoholic beer. I asked if she's SURE you don't have any because most restaurants have it. She said she's sure they don't have it.  So I walked over to the bar and ordered a non-alcoholic beer and they did indeed have it. I went back to my table with it and when the waitress came around again, I showed it to her and said this is a non-alcoholic beer. The waitress said ""I don't know anything about beer."" I pointed out to the waitress that she said she was sure they didn't have it. The waitress responded ""I'm new here"" First off, I don't appreciate a waitress laughing at me because of my drink selection. Second, I expect a waitress at a restaurant to know the entire menu, including the drink menu. If a waitress isn't sure whether they have a certain drink or not, she should CHECK instead of telling me she's sure you don't have it, when she really has no idea what you have or don't have.  I find the service insulting. As for the food, I ordered the A.1. Peppercorn Burger which is $11. It took the food a long time to come out, and mine was served cold.

Also just a note, I have read some people have had really slow service or bad service here.. I am wondering if it depends on floor and kitchen staff changes?

One burger was not only burnt, it was missing most of the ingredients as listed in the menu. The second burger was also burnt..:black around the edges. Neither burger was hot..:slightly warm at best. We each took a bite of the burger and it was hands down the worst burger we had ever had. We promptly paid our bill leaving a bite only out of the burgers and went to In and Out which is where we should have gone in the first place. We will never patron this restaurant again!!!

My boyfriend called to order our food, only to be put on hold for at least 15/20 minutes and had to hang up and call back. After asking to speak to the manager he was able to order our food. He was asked specifically if he wanted his burger cooked all the way or with pink in the middle, his answer was ""burn it."" He likes it crispy.  After picking up our food and bringing it home, I didn't even want to eat it. Not only was all of our food COLD AND SOGGY, his burger had pink in the middle and was partly raw. My chicken sandwich was not cooked all the way and had a good chunk of fat on it, I had to stop eating it. Also for a place that has ""bottomless fries with a burger"" in the Togo orders they are HELLA STINGY with their fries, we are not happy whatsoever.

Jeff R.,"Watsonville, CA",52,111,3,1.0,4/1/2015,"After posting a lengthily review of my experience on Yelp, I was contacted by (what I assume was a manager) via the yelp review asking me for my contact information.  I forwarded this to them and never heard back from anybody. Oh well........ Just to make sure others can see my original reply that was minimized by this current update, I've cut and pasted the review here: Decided to eat at Chili's off Cochran in Morgan Hill.  As we drove up we saw a large group of people in the foyer.  Didn't know if they were waiting or leaving, so we decided to drive next door to Red Robin instead. It was Sunday night at 8:00 PM.  Walked in and there was no hostess for over a minute.  We were the only ones in the Foyer.   As we were standing there, other employees passed us without any acknowledgment.  The place was kind-a of busy but the first thing that we noticed was so many tables were empty but need to be bused from the past guests on both side of the premises, bar and main dinging room.  Finally young women (Hostess) walked up with wind-blown hair and greeted us.  Her hair was so frazzled it was like she just flew in from a hang glider......Not very professional nor kept! We were seated and five minutes later our waitress came over and said she'd be right back. Ten minutes later she came to take our drink order.  She must have been pretty new as she didn't know the prices of the import draft beers nor the condiments on the burgers listed in the menu.  We placed our order and waited another ten minutes for our drinks to arrive.  Side note; all the tables that need to be bused still remained.  See pictures.  Another twenty minutes went by and our waitress came over and surprisingly dropped off a basket of fries and apologized for the wait.  She scurried off.  We grabbed the ketchup from our table and it was empty.  I went over to another table a retrieved another from a vacant (un-bussed table) but it was empty too.  I finally found a half way full bottle and duped our fries.  The fries were absolutely room temp cold.  Needless to say we didn't eat them.  Also to be mentioned as we were waiting, I noticed that one of the cooks (in the kitchen) with long dark hair did not have a hat of cap on. I think this might be a requirement of food staff........ More time passed and our waitress never came back.  The wind- swept hostess was busy making red balloons and remained much focused on her little task.  As other people entered the restaurant they too had to wait in the foyer.  It was now 45 minutes since we'd been seated, the tables around us still remained to be bused and oh yeah, never a manager around. At our fifty minute mark without any food and cold fries, I decided to leave.  I left money with the hostess for our drinks and we left. Drove across the freeway and ate drive through at In-N-Out Burger.  Way better and no drama nor wait! I haven't worked in the food service industry for quite some time, but if this was my establishment heads would be rolling.  I would hate to have a review like this one on my property.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=120

After being seated I noticed that there were more dirty tables than clean tables. Only two servers and no bus boy.  Our server Cynthia was very nice but only checked on us once throughout our lunch.

Others had warned me but we decided to give it a try. Even the water tastes bad in this place. The service is slow, the food is mediocre.  When we sat down they told us they were short staffed. The servers and hostess were working hard. From all the dirty tables I have to assume they didn't have anyone to clean the tables. I would recommend that the manager who was walking around, half heartedly asking each table how their meal was, could have pitched in and cleared some tables.  We were really hungry so we ordered chips which didn't come until after we got our entrees. They were kind enough to take them back to the kitchen. We had burgers which were just ok. When our burgers arrived I realized we didn't have napkins or utensils so we waited, staring at our burgers for a bit. They did return with the silverware and napkins but unfortunately only forks. I needed a knife. More waiting. They brought our table of four 1 knife which we all shared to cut our food.

I order the same item every time I eat at Red Robin, the Whiskey River BBQ Wrap, and each time it's placed in front of me the preparation is different. Is the chicken supposed to be hot or cold? Is the lettuce supposed to be hot or cold? Should the cheese be melted? Is there supposed to be ranch or BBQ on it? This place is so inconsistent that I don't know how my entree is intended to be prepared.  The servers are nice, but the service is bad. There just isn't good communication between the servers and their guests. It takes WAY too long to get your food at this location and when you do it's sub-par at best. I often find myself twisting around in my seat to find someone, ANYONE, who can give me the status of my order/refill a drink/drop off some fries because my food is taking faaaar too long to get to my table. This could be mostly alleviated if the servers were better at stopping off at their tables and communicating with their guests. It's also frustrating that after a bad experience the server will drop off the bill without apology or attempting to make the customer happy. A free round of drinks, dessert, entree really goes a long way after a poor dining experience.  Management needs to step it up at this location.

She even got our drinks fairly quick as well. It was amazing! Then it went downhill in the typical Morgan Hill Red Robin fashion. I asked the waitress if we could get a basket of fries since right away I had a little one who was hungry. The answer was yes. Of course I knew I wouldn't be getting those fries. I've asked the same question 3 times during my last 3 visits and told yes each time. And all 3 times my request was ignored. Try it if you're reading this. See what happens.  Anyway, the food comes out 25 minutes later. I have a bacon cheeseburger. It's nice and cold. Fries too. We ordered fruit for my son's meal and got fries instead. Happens all the time there though.  Glasses never got re-filled. Waitress hardly checked on us. Had to ask for utensils and napkins. Ketchup bottle was empty.  It just seems this place is massively understaffed. I will never go back there. I have learned my lesson. One lesson I can't seem to learn is that I can make better food at home but still go out and spend $45 for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=160

Less than half the restaurant is full.  15 minute wait for a table after the girl at the front said, ""I can't help you because I'm trying to get off my shift."" No clean silverware at the table because ""we are so busy we can't keep up with the dishes""  Server was apologetic up front and said they have been behind all day.

Kids meals arrived promptly (three kids in the party) Our burgers (3 adults) took another 30 minutes to arrive.  Our server explained the kitchen was so behind that the manager was back there helping.  Food finally arrives.  Sweet pot fries are completely burned. When we questioned him about bringing us burned food he said, Ok I'll get you another basket.  Asked for dessert menu for the kids.  15+ minute wait.  Server brings the regular menu and says, we don't have a kids dessert menu. Track him down for the bill. Ask for the manager.  She will come see us ""in a few minutes"".  She comes out and acts like she has absolutely NO CLUE about the condition of her restaurant.  Asks if we want to sign up for reward cards?!   It's now 10:00 p.m.  The kids are melting.   Manager offers to ""see what she can do"" about the bill.

He did his best to bring everything out as fast as he could and provided a great service. I also liked that the kid's menu had healthy sides such as sliced apples. But then... As the evening wore on, the restaurant got progressively louder. There was a lot of screaming, ""What?! What?! I can't hear you,"" across our table. We finally gave up trying to talk to each other. The restaurant is a large, open area with not much to keep the noise level down.  The food was just okay. The reason it wasn't great was because everything was literally drowning in salt. I thought I was imagining things until I picked up the nutrition guide on the table and it confirmed it. It's a shame because there were a lot of great ingredients in the food with the potential to shine on their own without needing to be overly enhanced with this specific seasoning. People can always add salt if they need more but you sure can't take it away once it's there. I got that, ""I could make this better at home,"" kind of feeling.  I'd come back here for T.J.'s service alone,  and maybe during an off time when there aren't as many people, or if I'm having a raging salt craving, but it won't be my first dining choice when eating out in Morgan Hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=160
Joe F.,"San Jose, CA",3,8,5,1.0,1/1/2015,"12/29/14 3:00 PM - Terrible experience, our team has eaten about 1000 meals at Red Robin, Morgan Hill.  Mostly pretty good.  But today, we had to leave after an hour of sitting at our table and not getting our food.  5 Waitresses in the shop, very few customers.  It took about 20 minutes to get drinks after asking three times.  Ordered food at same time and waited for almost 1 hour.  Repeatedly asked several waitresses to check on our food - nothing unusual - Jut burgers and salads.  Each waitress promised she would check and get right back to us.  10 minutes later, nothing.   We watched the manager and the waitresses talking back in the serving area for at least half of that time, having a grand old time.   I think Red Robin corporate needs to visit this place and get it back on track with their good service, not the type of service we've seen today.   By the way, we took the team over to Eriks Deli and have sandwiches and salads in about 5 minutes after arriving.  I guess, it's time to change we we normally go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=160

Granted, you have to like broccoli.  But they have a wonderful way of preparing it here.  It's served in a small bowl like finger food.  The pieces are cut into small flowerets, so it was easy to eat like finger food.  You could see char-broil marks on the sides - an added grilled taste.  Perhaps it was soaked a short while in brine, because I didn't need to add salt.  And it was done exactly right - not squeaky, not limp.  It was a perfect broccoli experience!

Sam W.,"San Jose, CA",7,20,,1.0,4/13/2015,"Made the mistake of taking my family in here Sunday evening for the following reasons: 1. Understaffed - which led to empty tables with a long wait plus un-bussed tables for us to look at for long periods of time while we were eating. 2. No one greeted us at our table for well over 5 minutes. Maybe 10 minutes. A waiter was walking by and saw that we hadn't been greeted yet, so he would ""help us out"" and take the table. Sorry, but I don't come to a restaurant and drop almost $50 to be a charity case. 3. During the meal, I asked our server for a refill on my soda. He took my half full cup and placed it on the nearby shelf. I had to wait well over 10 minutes to get another drink. Train your staff to NOT take guests' drinks and to simply bring them a new one when the ask for refills. In the server's defense, I think he was frazzled due to having too many tables which leads us back to short staffing.  * The food was excellent as always though.

Maria N.,"Hollister, CA",8,7,,1.0,2/25/2016,"This was worst dining experience I have ever had.  Let's start with how long it took for my party to get our drinks. We sat down, about 15 to 20 minutes for us to even see our waitress to take our drink order. While we were waiting for her to take our drink order, about 5 minutes into sitting there, a random drink shows up. Which wasn't ours since we hadn't even seen our waitress. Finally we put in our drink order. Takes another 10 minutes for us to get them. By this time, a friend of ours left work, went home changed clothes. Drove from Hollister to Morgan Hill to get there in enough time to order his dinner. He put in his order and drink order. So by the time our food gets here, one of my friends food didn't taste like a single thing. He put salt and pepper. Even the fries seasoning. Nothing. We had to flag down the waitress to get her attention. Told her it was terrible. She took his burger and didn't charge him. Btw the person who drove in from Hollister and got there late, she forgot his drink order! He was 1/2 way through his meal before he got his drink. Plus, the drink that was sent over from another table, we also got their food order. She mixed us up with another table. So, this is the part where it really gets bad. We are sitting and sitting and sitting and sitting. Waiting for our check. Btw, we told her it was all separates tabs when we sat down. Now, red robin has tablets at every table where you can split the tab and pay.  As we tried to do this. She messed up everything single tab. She only charged two people of our party for drinks. Others, she added extra appetizers that another person ordered. She even added extra drinks. Once again, we flag her down. Told her we'd like the check. She tells us to use the tablet. We tell her they are messed up. She leaves to fix it. And we wait. And we wait and we wait. And we wait. All of us feeling held hostage cause ALL WE WANT TO DO IS PAY AND LEAVE!!! So I go and find another waitress ask for the manager. She disappears. And we wait and we wait and we wait and we wait. So, finally I find the hostess. Ask her for the manager. She disappears. We wait and wait and we wait. Finally I get up and look for him myself. Found him, sorting through all our checks. Finally I was able to complain and get things straighten out. Plus, all our appetizers were taken off for the wait. Which was nice but the waitress had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong!? She didn't do anything right! I watched other people be seated, get there food, and leave. THEY ARRIVED AFTER US! She waited on them! She did not wait on us at all! Sad thing the bill was about $120 dollars between the 5 of us. We ended up only paying $40! She lost them so much money! We were even planning on buy more alcoholic beverages and desert. Nope!

Our food came out about 20 minutes after putting in the order.  I ordered a Garden burger with no sauce.  It was actually ok.  I've had better ones at The Counter..lol.  The steak fries was hot and crispy.  Since they were bottomless, my friends were able to get more fries. =) When it was time to light the cake, the server helped us find a lighter.  He even gave us the bill pretty fast.  I liked that we didn't have to flag him down..lol.

When host did arrive she turned her back to everyone and started looking at her iPad. People had to say something to her to get her to put their name on the list. We put in our names and we were told 20 min wait. It was 1:00 on a Sunday so I figured not to bad.  3. Looking around the restaurant and counting the number of empty/dirty tables and I was shocked. There were 14 dirty tables and with a full waiting area you think they would put some hustle in their step. NOPE they are moving like snails. The servers walk by dirty tables over and over again. I get it, it's not your job but I think you would want more tips and the longer we wait the smaller the tips get....... 4. 35 minutes later with 3 clean tables in the place (yes still 14 dirty ones) we get seated. I am not over stating anything when I say 14 dirty tables, the table right next to the waiting area was dirty from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. 5. We are seated, starving, and with a hungry 6 year old so we want to order now. Takes the server almost 10 minutes to come to our table. There is a table to our right complaining that it has taken 30 minutes to get their check and a table to our left that keeps asking for the manager. We order everything the moment he arrives. 6. Order is:  Soda, Tea (extra lemon), kids lemonade, and chocolate shake. Kids spaghetti, Blue Burger, and a red robin burger.  When we got the drinks there was 1 lemon wedge and the shake had no whip cream & no tin with extra. When my Blue Burger arrived it had burnt onion strings. The server did get me new onion strings but that is a big fail at quality control. He never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.  7. Check please! We asked for boxes and the check as soon as we could. Another 10 minutes to get the check.  8. And last but no least, the bathrooms. I'm lucky that there was a roll sitting on the handicap bar. There were empty rolls on the floor. Garbage can overflowing. You can ell no one had been in there in HOURS. As I'm washing my hands the hostess walks out washes her hands and leaves.

The service was even worse. My husband (who also reviewed) asked if they sell non-alcoholic beer and the waitress laughed at him and said no. When she returned later to take our food order, he asked her again if she was absolutely sure they don't have any non-alcoholic beer, and she said she was sure they didn't.  I don't get the attitude at all. First of all, it's really rude to laugh in the face of someone placing an order.  Second, isn't it in the waitstaff's best interest to get the customer's bill as  high as possible? How do you think tips are calculated? He ended up walking over to the bar and paying for the beer over there (because yes, they actually DO serve it). That's four dollars off our bill, so more money off her tip (well, in addition to the money he deducted for the terrible service. Seriously- don't laugh at your customers).  When she returned he showed her the beer and not only was she totally flippant about stating she was sure before, she didn't offer any apology for her attitude and said she was ""new here.""  I have waited tables before, and while I understand completely it takes a while to learn the menu, how hard is it to ask the bartender which beers are available if you're not sure?

Ok... so part of it's my fault.  I tried to swing by with a co worker during our hour long lunch break, only we were a bit short on time, since it took us a good 15-20 minutes before we decided to head out of the office. That leaves us with 45minutes top for lunch. Now this place opens around 11, and we had lunch just around that time, so we were in-fact one of the first through the door.  Moving forward we'll call in our order but today was a learning opportunity, so well... we didn't. Now we know. I was dropped off at the front door, as my co worker parked.  I tried to open the door while holding my purse, umbrella,  and something else important I'm sure.  To my dismay, the hostess stood watching; as I nearly dropped everything trying to open the door.  Had I not have been afraid of destroying my hair in the rain, I would have dropped my umbrella, but this was not an option. Hostess= 1 star. Upon being seated we were quickly ready to order, unfortunately we had to wait while the waiter checked on two other tables, and input their orders, before even taking our drink order.  I used to wait, and this took way too long. Finally, I mentioned to the server, that we were in a bit of a hurry.  He asked if I wanted my appetizer first, responded with whatever get's it here fastest.  Fastest. Faster. Most Fast.  Um.... If I've already mentioned that I'm in a hurry, and I ask for the fastest method; then why does my food take 20 minutes? Why does my appetizer come out with my food, piping hot from the fryer, when it could have been fried from the get go in 3mins?   And finally.... Why was I able to see my food at the counter, being passed up by waiter after waiter, rather being immediately brought to my table? Yeah... What a waste.  We literally scarfed down our lunch in 8minutes.  Yumm... Not. You cant even taste it when you eat that fast :( Also Bottomless fries, are only good if they give you more than like 10 per person.  Why be skimpy?  They're bottomless, darn it!

They make you wait forever so you will get tired of waiting and just want to leave.

Peggy R.,"San Martin, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/29/2016,My husband and I took our three grandson's to Red Robin on Saturday March 9th. It was the middle one's 9th birthday and he requested to go to there. We should have walked out when our waitress came to our table and said have you been here before I am trying to get out of here and showed us the device on the table to order ourselves. We were unable to order ourselves as the device was broken she came back after 10 minutes and took our drink order. The boys of course wanted the all you can drink root beer floats. When she dropped off the drinks she took our order and we did not see her for a while everyone needed refills by this time. Someone else dropped off out food. We had no silverware and my husbands order was wrong. It took a while to get someone to acknowledge us as they were all back there chit chatting We had someone else bring us silverware then our waitress came and asked if we wanted refills. I told her my husband did not order sweet potatoes fries and would like regular fries. He did not get the fries until long after he was done with his meal. I pointed out that we were charged for the sweet potatoes fries she said she would take care of it took the bill. When she returned it was still wrong. I just paid for it. Our bottomless french fries never happened the endless root beer floats never happened. The whole experience was a let down especially for our grandson whose birthday it was.

Burger was cooked with a little bit of pink as requested and the fries were good as usual. BOTTOMLESS FRIES YAAAAYYYYYY!

I was hungry, it was hot outside, I just wanted to bury my face into my delicious Royal Red Robin burger BUT WAIT! I don't have any napkins. I can't eat without any napkins. What if I get my face hella sauced up, what I am going to do? So we waited, and waited, and waited and then finally our waiter! We ask for napkins and then back to waiting, still waiting, oh yeah napkins..........So we finish our meal and I pay with my card. He brings back the receipt and my buddy asks for a refill. I grab my card and look for a pen to sign the receipt but no pen, should I just leave? lol 10min pass by and no refill, no pen, and nobody around. We eventually get our refill and a pen but didn't leave too happy, full, but just a little annoyed.

Em O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,82,3,1.0,11/18/2015,"Every single time we resort to coming here it is the same: Servers are very sweet, but the actual service is inconsistent.  We were both servers, in fact I was a server for over a decade and I am absolutely shocked to see the amount of servers going to the back without full hands (meaning they have pre-bussed a table) and coming out of the kitchen without full hands, meaning they are not bringing food out. The result for the customer is a table full of empty glasses and dirty dishes, and that your food has been waiting so long to be delivered after cooking that it is just warm at best when it comes to the table.  My former managers at the various restaurants I have worked at would never have allowed this. Getting the food out hot was one of the top priorities even if the food you were delivering was to a table that was not yours. The server should be in tuned to the guests' needs even if the those needs are not outwardly expressed.That means if someone has a kid, get them in and out as quickly as possible or ask if they can fire up a kids meal asap. This means bringing refills out even if a guest doesn't ask for them.  we asked for refills, and they were never brought. It seems to me that the management could help guide the servers as to how to manage their sections more like one big table rather than individual tables. For instance get all the drinks at once, get refills at once, refill waters all at once and even refill waters in a station next to yours for another server, clear dishes all at once etc... Management could teach servers how to multi task when they are going in an out of the kitchen by making sure that everyone has full hands in and full hands out. I worked at a restaurant where we were not even allowed to go into the kitchen without bringing something back from the tables and not allowed to come out of the kitchen without something to deliver out to a table. Bottom line is they have a staff that is friendly and wants to please people but just need the tools and guidance on how to do this better. These are easy simple fixes that don't take a lot of time, but vastly improve the quality of the food and service.   Needless to say we won't be back after so many not so great experiences. The two stars given are solely for the staff's sweet disposition and the kitchen who I am sure puts hot food out on the line before it sits there for 10 or 15 minutes getting cold",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=240

Since the bill had already come, she needed to add my burger on. So she took the bill back and disappeared for about 15 mins. When she came back the burger had been added. It seemed like forever to get my burger. I swear it was at least 30 mins. She had passed our table several times and never offered to check on my meal until we finally flagged her down and asked her about it. She apologized and trotted off to the kitchen, but not before I reminded her it needed to be in a ""to go"" box.  Viola! My burger finally comes out. On a plate. I sent it back and reminded them it was ""to go"" for the 3rd time. They apologized and finally brought the burger out in a box.

Very unprofessional didn't comp my sisters meal comps the kids meal. Then the manager goes over and ripped the server at the servers station where everyone could see!! So unprofessional. None of this would have happened if the manager would have trained his servers properly.

I don't even want to give this a star but I have to to write this awful review on this shit hole all together. Bad bad bad service. I don't even think The waitresses there were even trained. And they don't care what there cooks do obviously with what I saw. DO NOT!!!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT!!!!!! GO HERE TO EAT EVER. YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THE SAME EXACT EXPERIENCE I JUST HAD!!!! Shut this place down and get new management in there right away if you want to continue ever having service there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=260
Ken J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,10,3,1.0,1/31/2015,"Update: 5/2016 Despite previous experiences, my family has eaten at the MH location and others a few times since my last comments. Our recent experiences at the MH location up to last week have been mixed. On two early lunch time visits the service was extremely slow despite the relatively small lunchtime crowd. The food was fine and the service though slow was attentive to the needs of the table. Another dinner visit started out fine. The place wasn't busy (~50% capacity) and service was slow but good enough. The order was messed up or the food was prepared incorrectly (missing items). Asking the server for clarification didn't help. We were told that the food item was prepared correctly and that we were probably mistaken... That's possible.  Jump to last week.  For a treat we decided to eat out and my kids voted for RR. We went early to avoid past problems. We were seated right away and had a great waiter that got us started immediately with drinks. The table and seats were quite dirty and littered with crumbs and smudges from the previous diners. My daughter took her first sip from her water and the straw blocked... thinking it was ice tried again and got what looked like a piece of pickle (we hope) in her mouth. The food came and again one of the items was prepared incorrectly or was completely misrepresented in the menu. Asking for clarification on this occasion was answered almost exactly the same way. The Ketchup at the table was empty and the one we got from a neighboring empty table was so greasy it had to be wiped down with a napkin to be held. My fingers looked wet. The well-done burger patties on two of the sandwiches were burned on one side (truly burned). An attempt was made to hide it under the cheese and abnormally large amounts of sauce. I couldn't eat mine.  In short, the server was attentive but unaffected by questions about the quality of the food preparation. The table was dirty the dishes were dirty and the food burned. I left a full tip, at least two half-full plates and probably left for the last time. 1/31/2015 I love Red Robin's burgers and fish 'n chips.  I try to keep an open mind  when it comes to reviews because we are more likely to be motivated to voice a complaint than praise. However, last night was beyond belief.  I've taken my family to the MH location for a couple of years  and eaten at the restaurant at locations all over the US. The menu and service is generally good or on par with other restaurants of this type. But in this case with the MH location  I've been steadily and increasingly disappointed with the service.  Last night was a busy  Friday night.  We were prepared for a long wait.  We weren't well enough prepared.  We ordered after a long wait.  We asked for utensils  which we didn't have.  An hour later we had had our drinks refilled  once but my son had to leave to go to work without eating. The food came about 20 min later.  It was cold.  We still didn't have eating utensils or drink refills. After asking our waiter twice and another waitress for utensils, my wife got up and walked back to the prep station to find him. He said he'd get them  but continued for some minutes with whatever else he was doing. I found a waitress who finally got us something to eat with.  Our waiter came along 15 minutes later with drinks and a Sheepish grin. We began our cold  meal 30 minutes after the food came.  The food was ok but would have been good or great if warm.  The sad thing is we were not alone. Some tables got up and left in frustration.  Needless to say that was our last visit to the MH location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=260

We ordered queso and guacamole for an appetizer. The queso came out, but the prep guys never made the guacamole, so it was about thirty minutes before I even got that. The food came out finally after we were wondering if we were going to be able to make our movie. Food wasn't even all that hot. Fries were cold! Waiter came by and asked me if I wanted a refill.

They basically threw some 7-11 style jalapenos on the burger and had some chipotle mayo that was basically mayo with some paprika in it.   They offer this thing called ""bottomless steak fries"" where you can get as many fries as you want but I have to agree with other reviews saying there was too much salt. Way to much salt even for me.   Got some fancy lime, sprite drink that was so so but 3.99 for that plus the 9.29 for the burger seemed way overpriced for chain restaurant food.

I now have to make a 25 minute drive north to enjoy Red Robin in piece and quite!! I suggest a reform in management if this place wants to stay in business.

What a mistake that was. The wait was approximately 20 minutes, that's understandable since it was a Sunday night and everybody's out. However, once we ordered our food, that's where things went bad fast. First of all we clearly told our waiter that we wanted our burgers with the Salsa and Mayo on the side (twice). After waiting about 30 minutes for our food, it comes and sure enough, BOTH orders were wrong. We decided to eat them the way they were, since we'd probably have to wait even longer for them to remake our order. Once our waiter comes back, we ask him for the dressing for my wife's salad. Sure enough, he kept forgetting. Once again we had to wait for the bill to come back, and for a to-go box.

Go here for great food and nice staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Dustin I.,"Morgan Hill, CA",1,4,6,3.0,11/9/2010,What can you expect from a chain? I ordered the steak sliders and the meat was pressed in circle forms which brings back memories the McRib from McDonalds,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Mike M.,"San Jose, CA",24,40,,2.0,5/30/2010,"My 5 year old loves the Pizza and the Red Bird characters.   I go there for the bottomless onion rings, but this place has terrible service and I will not go back.   I know it is not a TOP restaurant and I  would give them a break because we all can have bad days, but I expect better service than Mcdonalds and I blame the management for these characters.    -Mr Personality (the host) after being told how many was  in our party might learn to greet us, let us know how long the wait is, or ask us to follow him rather than focusing on making sure his menus are clean.     -My lost  in thought (waiter) could try serving us, maybe getting drinks,  within 15 minutes after ordering and get have silverware on the table before the food has arrived..  Weird how I made four different request for these things.   The last straw was asking, or reminding, the staff that they did not have any toilet paper in the bathroom.     I have one word for everyone:  CHILIS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Melisa Y.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/7/2012,"I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a few modifications. Instead of fries I had the Mac & Cheese. They are really great about letting you modify anything you order & my burger was cooked just right. Ambiance is casual, & the price range is not too expensive. Overall, good service & good burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Ace R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,28,,1.0,4/20/2011,"First, if I want a good tasting burger, I'll go to in and out. This service was subpar. Case in point, my order came with fries but I wanted onion rings. I told the waitress that I wanted onion rings instead and she said sure no problem. My order finally came with....fries!!! Ummm, can I have onion rings instead please, the waitress apologized and brought me my onion rings 10 minutes later. I ate one ring and wanted to barf, I waited 10 minutes for this. So I trashed them and ended up eating the better tasting fries. I get my bill and they charged me $.99 extra for the gross onion rings. I called the waitress over and asked her what was the deal. With a matter of fact attitude she said, ""yeah, didn't you see the writing on the menu"". Oh yea, I'm sorry I forgot my magnifying glass. Red Robin, you've been shot down and being fed to the buzzards. I will never ever eat there!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Jesika F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",43,45,18,1.0,6/5/2011,By far the worst customer service! Their hostesses were beyond rude and cared more about the story a waiter was telling rather then seating a customer. Apparently you cant be seated at their bar unless the bartender isn't off break yet a person is standing in the bar making drinks. Everytime I've went into RR the service was horrible I wouldn't recommend at all!! Of course unless you want to leave irritated. The one at Eastridge mall is by far the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Tony B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,47,6,4.0,2/27/2012,"Food is solid, kind of what you expect.  Waiter service is great, though the front/greeter staff are nowhere near as good.  Too many empty tables while people wait with no explanation.  I enjoy visiting here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Lorene M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,77,,1.0,8/19/2011,"Went there to meet up with family for a great meal.  Truly disappointed from the get go, took 20 minutes to get anyone's attention to seat us.  Then I ordered a burger well done, no cheese and of course got a rare burger with cheese.  At first, I had just asked for steak sauce before I even bit into the burger, that took forever, then I noticed it was not cooked to well done, couldn't find anyone to help out.  I then asked for the manager, she offered another burger, eveyone else had eaten at this point so I said no.  Sad to say, I won't be back, if they can't even cook a hamburger, nor can you find your waiter for help and then the manager comes along at the end of your meal for a replacement burger that just doesn't work.   Truly disappointed in a local place to eat, I'll go elsewhere to catch up with family and friends and a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Trent C.,"Chicago, IL",11,194,19,3.0,8/18/2010,This is probably one of the few Red Robin's that I've been to that have good service.  Always busy at lunchtime but you can be in and out is a short timeframe.  Food was good.  Expect to see families here with kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
R A.,"Gilroy, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2011,"So we get there around 6:30 and we're starving, we place our order and ask for a basket of fries to hold the 5 of us over until our meal is served.  My wife had asked 3 times and 2 different people to please bring us the basket of fries, we were continually told they'll be right out. We also had to continually ask our waiter for drink refills.We finally got them when we received the bill.  The food is good but the service SUCKED!!  This place used to be decent for service and food but seems to be lacking in our several recent trips.  Chili's is right across the parking lot guys, figure it out quickly.  Enjoy your $2 tip, we wont be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320

Brian K.,"Morgan Hill, CA",2,10,,4.0,11/24/2008,"Have gone three times and each time the restaurant has been busy but the service was surprisingly good.  Wait times were very reasonable and the servers were pleasant.  I think it's pricey for just burgers, but they are above average burgers from a size and taste perspective.  All-you-can eat fries are kind of pointless since no one I know has room for more fries after eating a big gut bomb burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320
Worker B.,"Milpitas, CA",0,58,,3.0,11/18/2008,Just okay. Burgers and fries are about the same each time. But service varies wildly. It totally depends on your server whether you get your food hot or in a timely manner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=320

Brandi T.,"San Jose, CA",181,35,5,2.0,11/13/2008,"I'm giving these guys two stars not one because I do enjoy the burgers, they're standard chain restaurant fair, whatever. I grew up in Morgan Hill, I didn't live there but I went to high school there and couldn't WAIT to not have to go there everyday to be harrassed. Ok, so that being said, I'm working for my step-dad who's office is in their house IN Morgan Hill. So a week ago our car was in the shop so my boyfriend couldn't come pick me up and he'd had a rough day at school so I thought I'd cheer him up with some Red Robin burgers! Nice, huh? Then I walked in. I felt like I was the outcast in high school all over again. Is it SO hard to have your wait staff greet your customers with a smile? Is it? How about training them to NOT give people dirty looks? So I look a little odd, what of it? Does that make my money not good enough for you? Lucky for us we don't live that far from another Red Robin. I'm not a fan of eating IN their restaurant as it gets too loud and crowded but I won't be coming back to the Morgan Hill location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=340
sarah m.,"Morgan Hill, CA",2,11,,2.0,7/10/2008,I concur with the other two reviews.  I add salt to everything and even I had a hard time with the burgers - at times it seemed as thought the cook straight out dropped the salt shaker in the burger.   I couldn't even allow my kids to eat their fries because they were marinating in salt.  Pretty nasty.  Service was okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=340
