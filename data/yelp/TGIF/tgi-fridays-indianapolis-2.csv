Nicole W.,"Louisville, KY",91,167,134,3.0,4/19/2009,"This place is clean and conveniently located, inside the mall food court. They did seat us right away on a Saturday night when all the other places in the area had a 1 hour wait. However, we did not know they have a limited Friday's menu that lacks the new gourmet mac 'n cheese that we were craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Margaret V.,"Canton, MI",286,1088,186,3.0,5/26/2014,"It's a Fridays and it's a place to get a hearty meal and a drink after shopping!  My husband and I usually stop here and get a drink or snack while in town for the Indy 500.  It's a little smaller than a regular friedyas, but they have the same menu and promotions as others.  So far, the staff has been nice!  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Kevin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,29,1,2.0,12/13/2013,For a restaurant in the mall this isn't bad. Meal was affordable and the food came fast. Good beer specials ever on a Friday night! Lajoya is a good waitress too! Update!  Later last night once we were home my wife started feeling nauseous. She ended up vomiting twice last night. She is almost back to 100% so it's pretty obvious this is most likely a case of food poisoning. Bummer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Jennifer S.,"Indianapolis, IN",470,359,3014,2.0,2/12/2014,"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but with a teenage daughter who insists on an occasional trip to the mall, I find myself here every so often for a beer while I wait.  Don't go hungry, the foods not good. Better to find a healthy option in the food court. The inside is small and kind of crowded (with a family), though the bar area is a little bit better.  Service is just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Scott H.,"Indianapolis, IN",65,389,2,3.0,9/12/2013,"Went there for lunch and I ate at the bar. I was eating a late lunch so the restaurant was pretty empty. The bar area was clean and there was a cool TV layout for sports fans. I ordered a cheeseburger and cheese fries, but they forgot the cheese fries order. The bartender was great. He went to the kitchen and quickly brought out fresh cheese fries. The food was pretty good. Not bad, but not fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Yessie B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/16/2013,First time I came here I both I and my husband got sick. We decided to give it another chance last night and service was poor we got to order at 10:04 we didn't get our food till 10:59 I know well done steak takes a while to cook but not an hour!! And still ended up paying$61&some change never again!! Pissed us off to see all waiters host whatever there called sitting down on chairs by the restrooms. Not professional! If they have no tables help clean or something!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Nichole H.,"Joshua, TX",64,321,,3.0,10/1/2008,"I really don't love TGI Friday's.  To be honest, I've never had a stellar experience there, but we always seem to default there when we're shopping at Castleton.  I guess we don't want to eat the typical mall food. The first time we ate here was okay.  We sat in the bar, the service was decent, our food was relatively quick and it tasted fine.  Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. Second time we sat at a table.  The service was noticable slower, although they weren't busy, and our food was mediocre.  Wait, no, mine was terrible.  I ordered fish and chips (what was I thinking!!!) and the fish was squishy. How do you have squishy FRIED fish?  By default fried is crispy, not squishy.  I suspect my meal was ready well before my fiance's and it sat.  LAME.  I should have sent it back. The only saving grace of this place - green bean fries with the chipotle ranch. Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Andy W.,"Indianapolis, IN",36,31,5,3.0,7/7/2006,"If you have to go to a chain restaurant, you can do worse (ahem...Applebee's) but it's still a mega chain, loud and has pretty much the same kind of options other mega chains have.  Considering how run-of-the-mill Friday's is, I'm always surprised how much I end up spending. If you're shopping nearby, there aren't a lot of inexpensive options so by default, Friday's is one of the better places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Nikki B.,"Greenwood, IN",9,57,,3.0,4/3/2011,"We were out & about yesterday & decided to eat here for dinner. The waitress name was Brandy that served us. She was a riot! My friend's hubby is a cut up & she was able to hang in there with him! lol! I ordered the half rib with loaded potatoes & vegetable medley! I ordered peach mango lemonade which I happened to be very pleased with. My friend ordered their chicken dinner with mexican cheese sauce. Unfortunately I forgot the name of it. Any who, she didn't like it & ended up not eating anything at all. :( My friends kept bragging about the vanilla bean cheesecake. I was stuffed to say the least so I took mines to go with chocolate sauce on the side. I like their food, it tastes good & they make it fresh. I also like that they clean the menus, since I'm a big germ-a-phobe. The fact that they do this accommodated me very well. My overall experience personally was good. As for my friend I think she was still mad at the fact that they didn't serve shrimp. That's what I think that her problem really was. It's a small spot in the mall & Brandy explained that they don't have enough space to serve shrimp on the menu.Like I told her, she needs to not eat so much seafood being pregnant anyway. This place served it's purpose for me at  least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
Jamie O.,"Fishers, IN",0,5,,2.0,5/15/2010,"The server was nice, but the service was slow.  We ate lunch there with our children (who often eat out and love to do so) - but by the end everyone was exasperated from waiting.  I was also surprised by the cost - we could have eaten more upscale for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-2
