143,Aaron F.,"New Orleans, LA",92,46,110.0,4.0,2014-06-18,"Good opening day. Great for business lunches to impress clients. The portions are huge. The waitstaff still needs gone tuning but it was the first day and it was really busy. Hostess were extremely nice. The decor and the menus are fancy. Plenty of seating. It's like any other one, but at least we have one here now. The happy hour deal is great. Still it's a bit on the expensive side.

100,Sharett L.,"New Orleans, LA",24,119,129.0,4.0,2014-06-20,"Visited this location during the weekend of their grand opening. Had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. The wait was almost 1 hour for the entree however 3 of the locations big shots (I'm guessing managers and regional managers) kept visiting my table to assure me that my food would be out promptly without me calling them or suggesting that I had been waiting a while. I'm sure this convenience will end 2 to 3 months from now once the location isn't so new.  The steak and scampi were fine (4stars) it was just alot of mushrooms! The service was fair for the amount of patrons in at one time since it was the lunch time rush.  I must admit that the busboys are very meticulous keeping the tables spotless and giving great detail to how they arrange flatware on the table. I just honestly hate how all the franchise locations don't put the silverware on plates or napkins, but directly onto the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=100,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times before, but this is the first Cheesecake Factory in the tri-state area (Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana). It's in a great location and the dining room is bigger than many other CFs I've been to. As always, the menu selection was amazing and the food that was ordered was flavorful and nicely presented (Dynamite Shrimp, Buffalo Blasts, Greek Salad, Chile Rillenos). Id also add that the service was exactly what I expected: phenomenal. Cheesecake Factory attracts a certain clientele that is sure to really make the area flourish.

229,Cinnamon G.,"New Orleans, LA",4,19,,1.0,2014-06-23,"We came here for dinner last week, the day after it opened. I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory anywhere else before and I thought I would give it a try because cheesecake sounded good that day. Food was OK, similar to what you'd get at Olive Garden, TGIF, or similar chain restaurants, but The Cheesecake Factory costs twice as much. The decor feels very much like an old hotel restaurant that has had many renovations and has an ongoing identity crisis. The service was some of the worst customer service I have ever had. We waited much longer than the ticketed estimated time, and I noticed that the hostesses kept telling people that the wait for a table would be less than it actually was, despite knowing that the wait would be longer. We were told repeatedly that the wait time would only be five minutes longer. Their ticketed waiting system is weird and inefficient.  Once we were ready to be seated, an African-American man with a purple shirt whom I presumed to be an assistant manager led us to our table, and when we arrived after a longer wait than we'd expected, the table had not been cleaned and had dirty dishes all over it. He asked us to wait our turn for the table to be cleaned and I saw many open tables and booths nearby that were cleaned and ready. I asked the man in the purple shirt for a different table and he stated that those tables were being reserved. As we continued to stand there while the busboys cleaned other tables before they could get to ours, I watched people that were behind us in line being seated at the clean tables and their drink orders being taken. After we were seated, we waited over fifteen minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence. It felt like we were being purposefully ignored. I noticed that we were the only Caucasian people in the vicinity and while we were being ignored, the African American man in the purple shirt was coming by and asking the tables of African American people around us if they needed anything. I've never felt the kind of blatant racism at a restaurant that I felt at The Cheesecake Factory. It was terrible.  Finally, a server from another section came by and asked us if we had been helped. She promptly took drink orders and brought us drinks. About fifteen minutes later, a man who was assigned to be our server came by and took our dinner order. We ordered garlic bread and zucchini and both of these appetizers were better than our meals. I should mention too that the menu at this restaurant has ads for other businesses on every other page. I've never seen anything like it, it felt cheesy and classless. I come to a restaurant to eat, relax, and enjoy myself, not to have more advertisements for other businesses tucked into my menu and flashed in my face. It's irritating and I felt disgusted that this restaurant thinks it's OK to intrude upon my leisure time out with more marketing. Are they not making enough money as a chain restaurant? Ugh... Offensive and presumptuous to say the least.  The meal arrived after about an hour and it just wasn't good enough to justify the price. The menu here has as much of an identity crisis as the decor. A little bit of whatever is popular right now, toned down and made palatable for the masses. ""Asian flavors"" are all the rage right now, as most foodies know. However, most foodies eat authentic Asian food regularly and this menu is very loosely inspired. Your palate will not be surprised and intrigued. It will be tricked by focus group tested entrees that are unadventurous and rather bland. Passable, but not memorable. A disappointment for any foodie. Trying to get drink refills was nearly impossible. We had a hard time flagging down a server. The tables near us though, seemed to be receiving excellent service.  After very little service throughout the entire meal, we were suddenly pressured to order dessert before we'd finished eating. When my friend finished his meal, the server tried to take his order for a dessert instead of waiting for us both. I felt rushed to finish, I really got the feeling that they wanted us to hurry up and leave. When I did finish, I had to flag the waiter down. We ordered two strawberry cheesecakes. Simple enough, right? Five minutes after we'd placed the order for the cheesecakes, a man I thought to be a manager or some corporate manager of one kind or another came by to inform us that they were out of strawberry cheesecake. We asked for cherry cheesecake instead. Five minutes later, he returned again to inform us that they did not have cherry cheesecake either. Day two at a restaurant called The Cheesecake Factory and they didn't have either. Absolutely perfect! The manager came out ten minutes later with two unappetizing slices of warm, melted cheesecake topped with cherry pie filling. We ate them quickly and left. The warm cheesecake was good, but certainly not the best.  You can eat better in NOLA and eat local, I do not recommend this restaurant for service or food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=200,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
138,Sara D.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",7,36,15.0,2.0,2014-06-24,"BLAND! I know that this restaurant is a chain and I had eaten at one many years ago but I don't remember being so disappointed. I stopped in yesterday afternoon for a leisurely lunch and to get a fix for my raging sweet tooth. My husband and I were seated immediately and service was way better than I would have expected for a place that recently opened. 4 stars for service.  The menu is ridiculously large. One page of small plates, two pages of appetizers, one page for salads, one page for pastas, one page for burgers, ect, ect.... What is on the menu is all over the place as well. Want Mexican? You are covered. Italian? Got it; pizza AND pasta. Asian? Plenty of choices. Seafood? Anything you want! Comfort food? But of course, the Cheesecake Factory has it all. With a menu this large though, everything has been toned down in flavor. The crab dip that I had ordered was so lacking, that I almost sent it back. It was crab and flavorless cheese served with hard, toasted bread. I had to swipe some fried onions from my hubby's burger to mix into the dip just so it would taste like something! And there was not enough bread for the amount of dip served.  My husbands burger was just OK. Not good enough to justify the price. He was going to get the chicken and biscuits, but at $17, that seemed a little outrageous. My sandwich was boring as well. I wanted a fancy pants turkey sandwich with a good spread or compote. I got a plain ol' turkey sandwich with wilted lettuce and a grainy slice of tomato and a tiny side salad. How dull, especially considering it was $11. The cheesecake was good, although we did not order the standard ones. Mine was a pineapple upside down cheesecake. Good, but not great, and served with two enormous poofs of awful whipped cream (tasted just like ready whip). His was a lemoncello torte. That was very good, nice and refreshing, however also served with the awful whipped cream and some tasteless strawberries. Tip: do not get the strawberry shortcake. The same tasteless strawberries are used for it. The table next to us ordered that and was complaining about the lack of flavor the whole time.  The set up of the restaurant is weird. There are so many tables crammed into the space; it is very difficult to get around with out knocking into servers, hostesses, the table next to you or other patrons. There should really take out about 20 to 30 of the small tables. I don't think I will go back again. Like I said, service was good, but that was just not enough to make up for the overpriced and incredibly bland food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=120,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

133,Shannon S.,"Garden District, New Orleans, LA",348,1780,629.0,2.0,2014-06-25,"I'm not the biggest fan of chains and generally I think in the New Orleans area we can get far superior food at a much better price than most national chains can provide.  It has been several years since I last ate at a Cheesecake Factory so I caved in and gave the new Metairie location a try (mainly because I was hankering for some cheesecake).  I've eaten at quite a few Cheesecake Factory's across the country from Nevada, Texas and Georgia and they are all pretty consistent as you would expect a chain to be.  As a chain comparison the Cheesecake Factory's food and ambiance is better than an Applebee's but less so than a Houston's. My theory on chains was proven as for my lunch portion of the shepherd's pie, iced tea, and a cheesecake the cost was $25 so I could've just gone to Commander's for a way better experience at a comparable price (that would've also included 25 cent martinis at Commander's so that bonus blows Cheesecake Factory out of the water).   The shepherd's pie was a hamburger patty broken up into the gravy and vegetable mix with mashed potatoes put over the top and while it was ok it was one of the least flavorful shepherd's pies I've ever had and probably one of the least well executed dishes that I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake and it was decent but I've definitely had better cheesecake locally and from Whole Foods.  The real price shocker is that the iced tea was nearly $3 which is ludicrous for plain unsweetened tea.  Their are some definite positives here as they do have a very large menu with a selection of items that should make most people happy.  The staff provided great and friendly service and were literally tripping over each other providing attention to my needs.  Clearly their reputation has proceeded them and there is frequently a large line waiting to be seated at this location as at many of their locations I've seen around the country. Other than the wide selection of cheesecakes and some tasty burgers I'm not sure what would really draw me here on a regular basis and put up with the crowd.  Personally I prefer the food at local establishments and find that at the Cheesecake Factory's price point I can have far better dining experiences elsewhere.  The good news is that now out of town tourists and suburbanites can now have a place to go to and leave my local gems unsullied by their uncouth and overly casual habits so I hope they enjoy waiting in their line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=120,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

It was hotter than normal, took the bun off and looked like it came out of the microwave. The meat inside was mediocre. I tried the Mac n cheese burger. The Mac n cheese component is fried. I think if it was hotter it would have been okay. As for the burger, you could tell it was not fresh. I would say the only thing that was enjoyable was the cheesecake.

42,Lauren L.,"Uptown, New Orleans, LA",277,249,454.0,2.0,2014-07-10,"Describe the Cheesecake Factory in the first three words that enter your mind! Go! Noisy Bread  Overpriced I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before, so this is solely based on my experience at the lakeside mall location.  First of all, there were an extreme amount if people gathered in front the restaurant, and immediately inside the front doors. People were blocking the door so badly at 530pm this Thursday night that we could hardly avoid knocking people while trying to get to the hostess station. The hostess! Oh my, the hostess. Have you ever heard anyone speak after inhaling helium? This was WORSE. 200 times worse! Her voice could PEEL the industrial PAINT off of an aircraft carrier.   We were told the wait would be a half an hour even though there were plenty of open tables; thank goodness it didn't take that long. We were seated and could barely  hear the waitress over the overbearing base line of the music playing. That is the only bit of the music you could hear over the cavernous echo-ey space filled with the voices of patrons, staff, clinking plates and cups.  We were brought bread pretty quickly. Free bread appetizer! I'm always a fan. Their pumpernickel and French bread earned one of these nifty stars. Very good. Our waters (water is a very complicated drink), were brought to us after we had finished the bread almost a half an hour after we were seated. Then, they brought out my brother's entree, about 10 minutes passed before our waitress came and asked US where the rest of our food was : I Really, lady? We are all sitting here waiting patiently for our food while his is getting cold.  So, here's the breakdown of the items we chose. (We all usually share) Spring rolls - pretty good. My brother was a fan of their peanut sauce. They had the Asian noodles on the plate and also wheat spaghetti = strange. Spicy chicken sandwich -not spicy, but still good. Chicken Madeira - picture here is about half because I was splitting it with my mother, and we ate some while waiting on an additional plate. And yes, I ordered specifically stating we were splitting it. Poor service on 2 counts now. She did refill my water glass frequently. Perhaps these two things were not within the waitress's control; it didn't affect her tip. It was delicious. I loved the potatoes. I had to ask though - ""are asparagus very expensive?"" There were two chicken breasts, and abundance of potato, but only 4 asparagus on the entire dish...ok...  While the food was acceptable, I found it very overpriced for the chain restaurant quality of food we received.

Four hostess was standing in front but did not greet us. I guess standing around talking to each other is more important than acknowledging the customers. Eventually we got seated. We sat there for a good 20 or so minutes with no service. Finally our waitress came by and took our drink orders. Waited another 20 or so minutes for drinks to arrive.

Calamari were small and batter too thick. $11.95 -I had the salad appt which was decent. $9.95 -Bf wanted the herb encrusted salmon but was told they were out of salmon for the evening (Really!?!? lame).

127,Dana P.,"Metairie, LA",176,283,8.0,2.0,2014-07-28,"Ok first off, I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories in California. So, I know what to expect from them. That being said, this location seriously needs help. Get some new management and staff pronto because this place running at it's current rate is completely unacceptable. I really wanted to leave a positive review since there are so many negative ones and I hoped to give them a chance. I seriously can not give a positive review after our experience yesterday though. We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a total of 4 in our party. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. Every other location I have been to always has a long wait as well, so I already expected that. They are just a popular place and always have a crowd. What I was not expecting though, was the inepptitude of the host staff. There were at least 4 of them ""running"" the front desk and they seemed to be unprepared at the overwhelming process of all the people. When our 40 minutes passed by, we went up to make sure we had not been forgotten. They said we still had 4 groups ahead of us. It took at least another 15-20 minutes before we were actually seated. One person took our drink orders. My table all ordered water, except for me. I ordered their iced tea. The iced tea alone is one thing that draws me to the Cheesecake Factory. They serve Paradise brand Tropical Tea and it is one of my favorites. Our ""server"" showed up a bit later. I use the term server loosely here because this guy's future actions depict him more as just a ""player"" looking to pick up phone numbers from women at other tables. He had no interest in conducting the duties of a server...mainly delivering food. He had his flashy watch and tie and seemed to spend the whole time we were there hanging out a couple tables away with 2 other women, just socializing the afternoon away. We gave him our order and asked for our comlimentary bread, which should have come out with our drinks and had not.  He never did bring the bread. We had to ask someone else passing by. I had ordered the Avocado Eggrolls as an appetizer. Some other person brought that out. The Avocado Eggrolls are always a favorite and they were just as delicous as I had remembered them. After some time passed, yet another person brought out 2 entrees for the other couple we were with. They were starving and said they wanted to start eating rather than wait for our entrees to come out. We understood and that was fine. My boyfriend received his entree yet from another different person. I never received my entree. We never did see our ""server"".  The other couple we were with started having doubts about their meal. Their pasta was supposed to have chicken in it, but it didn't have any. Our ""server"" finally showed up about 10 minutes asking how everything was. I said well, I never received my entree. He didn't seem to care much. Nor did he care that the other 2 people in our party were missing their chicken. He instead argued with them and said they must have ordered the wrong dish. He told me he would go see what was up with my missing salmon. We also asked for a refill on our bread. We never did get any. We asked 2-3 times over the course of the entire event, and he never brought any at all. When we looked over to see if he was finding out about my missing entree, he wasn't checking on my missing salmon, he was over hanging out with the women at the other table again. My boyfriend had to try and flag him down again. I told him to just forget the salmon, that by the time he ever would get around to bringing it, I would just need to take it home. I just finished the Avocado Eggrolls instead. We were never offered any drink refills by anyone. I had to wave down busboys a few times to help us out in that department. No manager ever came by to apologize for the missing meal. Looking back now, we should have demanded to speak to the manager.  At that point, the ""server"" just wanted to get rid of us. I guess we were interrupting him too much from his women. He wanted us to just pay and leave. We said we would like to have some cheesecake. He begrudgingly took our order. The cheesecake was very good as I remembered it to be. I know this place has been open for over a month, and yes they may still be trying to figure things out. But, you can't have this kind of horrendous staff ""working"" there. Please hire some professionals who are actually interested in doing work.  We won't be coming back here for quite awhile I'm sure. We might get take out and see how that goes, but it's doubtful. I'm thoroughly disappointed with the place. They do have good quality food, but the service is the pits. As for the prices, they are on the higher side, but they do serve large portions. The entrees are usually large enough to take the leftovers home for another meal. In my case for yesterday, I was not given that option since I never received my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,1.9280000000000002,2.84

It took us two hours from the time we got there until we got our food, I had an appointment and had to get my food put straight into a box waited another 15 minutes before they brought me dessert and when I got to my appointment and finally got to eat my food it was awful, don't order the fish tacos!

When we lived in NY it was the same story.  You can't just decide on a whim to come here, unless you want to wait an obscene amount of time.  If you're a larger party it's going to take even longer. The later you go the less stuff they'll have.  Don't feel like waiting a long time for a table? Go sit at the bar or the high top tables near the bar. At least this was an option while living in NY.

70,Jessica N.,"Gretna, LA",285,133,123.0,3.0,2014-08-05,"Normally I'm not a fan of chains but I do really like CF (have eaten there a few times in other states), so I was thrilled when I saw that the Metairie one had opened.  The BF and I went here on a Monday night around 7:30. It was our third attempt trying to eat here because each time we had tried, it was super packed with a crowd of people waiting outside to be seated. I figured Monday was typically a slower day for most restaurants so it was our best bet. The hostesses were friendly and initially quoted us a a wait time of 15 minutes but ended up seating us right away. I did see a couple of available tables but for the most part, it seemed to be a full house and very busy. The interior is beautiful and on par with other CF locations: same design, setup, menu, etc. Our server (I believe his name was Andrew or Andy) did an excellent job. I'm in the service industry myself so I'm usually particular about service wherever I go. He was very pleasant and checked on us several times to make sure everything was okay. Our appetizer, entrees and dessert came out promptly and we never had to wait long for food. Also, refills came steadily and complimentary bread was given to us without us having to ask (which I noticed wasn't always the case with other reviewers). We tried the bite sized crab cakes, crab and artichoke dip, Kobe burger and buffalo blasts. No complaints on the food at all. The side that my BF ordered didn't come out with his meal but Andrew/Andy was quick to take care of that and brought it out soon afterward, nice. The entire dinner took about an hour and we left feeling stuffed and satisfied. We'll be back. My thoughts overall after reading some of their bad reviews on Yelp: keep in mind that this location has only been open for a month. If you choose to dine at any high volume establishment this early on, you should realize that there are going to be kinks to work out with the food, staff and kitchen. Instead of going on a weekend where the wait and food times may take longer than expected or they may be out of certain times, I would recommend going on a weekday/night towards the beginning of the week. I'm sure this place is going to be a great addition to Metairie and will do very well here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.1559999999999997,2.6
190,Skylar C.,"Metairie, LA",0,5,,2.0,2014-08-07,"We have now eaten here twice, and both times turned out to be a disaster. The first time, we had lunch here. Our waitress was incredibly slow and inattentive. We waited for nearly an hour and a half for our food to come out. When we complained, the manager kindly told us that our food had been sent to another table by accident. (lol nice try. the waitress forgot to put our order in, but ok.) So after another 25 minutes, we received our entrees and a bill for the entire meal. Classy. Wanting to give it another try, considering the large menu, we decided to go for dinner this time. To begin with, we arrived at 9:20pm. Due to the incredibly slow service, we did not leave the restaurant until 12:35am. (how was this possible, by the way? Your restaurant was at about 30% capacity and you had more waiters and bussers running around than I've ever seen in any other place. Seriously....) Anyways, after being seated and handed menus by the hostess, we waited..... and waited.... and waited some more until finally, after about a half an hour, I got up to ask the hostess where our waitress was. Cut to 10 minutes after that when a girl who had passed us about 50 times before came walking up to our table apologizing because ""she didn't know it was her table."" sigh..... I decided to order this incredible eggplant sandwich, which turned out to be the least incredible thing I've ever consumed. It was practically oiled up, chewy eggplant with about two pounds of cheese on top of it and thrown on a soggy bun so that when you go to take your first bite, everything falls out and you're left with a pile of $12 slop. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the cheesecake is good. Also, $7.25 for a beer?

126,Bryan P.,"Westwego, LA",82,3,,2.0,2014-08-09,"Where do I start? I've been here twice since it opened in Metairie and plenty of times when I was out in other states on business trips.  My first time here was when it opened and it was good! My date and I were promptly seated and my waiter was really nice! Mind you we went at around 4 pm. I had an okay experience. Food was a little pricier than I remembered but, what the heck?  There's complimentary bread slices with cold butter- who the f does that?! If you're serving bread, make sure it's room temp.  I ordered the Southwestern Eggrolls, buffalo wings and a burger- don't remember which one (wasn't that memorable). I established that I liked the place enough and would come back with friends to have them try it. 2nd time we went was on a Friday night. Dear sweet baby Jesus was that the worse idea ever. We got there early...and I mean early at 6:30 and get this... We didn't get seated until 8 O'FREAKING CLOCK! It was only 4 people, mind you. Okay whatever, I had a good time catching up with friends We were sat at the veryyy back. Literally the window overlooked a brick wall. Our server, bless her heart, was an Indian girl for whom I could not, for the life of me understand. I felt so incredibly bad because none of my friends or my date could understand what she was saying either and had to ask her to repeat herself multiple times.  So, 15 minutes in, we still didn't get our drinks. The waitress finally comes back, gets our drink and finally our orders... We wait. And we wait. And for goodness sakes, we wait. It's now, oh idk, 8:35 ish and she comes back to tell me that my entree is out- seriously?! I pick something else, French Dip sandwich I think? Who cares, whatever...  During this whole escaped, we see 2 separate tables being seated... One was  a large group of women, about 6-7 seated at a round table next to us, another 4 party group, seated a little farther from us.. Well, it's now been about a 45 minute wait and our food has still yet to come out and our waitress has yet to check on us. BUT, OHHHH, the 2 tables that were seated much after us received their drinks, apps and entrees before ours even came out. WTF?! Literally at this point I wanted to just walk out of the restaurant, but I figured I waited this long and I didn't think my friends and date would have done the same. Lol. Finally, it's pushing close to 10pm and we get our entrees. Never again will I go here. We ordered 2 macaroni burgers, French dip, and a breakfast omelet combo. No one enjoyed their food and we were all pretty tired from waiting so long to eat an overpriced, sub par, chain restaurant. By the time we left, we had seen our waitress about 3 times. Once for drinks, second it take our orders and 3rd to give us our check. The runners brought our food out... Oh, and for clarity, we left the restaurant at around 10:45.

This is the first time I have ever intentionally left $0 as a tip; believe me she earned it.  Out with friends to celebrate a birthday, we decided upon the Cheesecake Factory for two reasons: it's newness in the area & proximity.  The wait was 35 minutes; we provided a cellphone number, as requested, for notification when our table was ready. We asked for 1st available with a preference for outdoor seating.  *****Reasons for less than 5 stars***** More than 5 items we attempted to order were unavailable or the kitchen was unable to prepare (for 1 reason or another) A bread basket was promised before the meal, however, it arrived AFTER our food was served.  Drinks were not refilled even after the server visited our area on more than 6 occasions, yes I counted, she managed to steer clear of our table - maybe she was embarrassed, idk.  Three in our party & one person received her meal 20 minutes prior to the other two of us  We had to request silverware, which arrived 5-7 minutes after the 1st person in our party received her food.  Appetizers were NEVER delivered or even spoken of until we had to remind her NOT to place them on the bill.  The manager brought our food out & apologized for the error; as he stated he was just made privy to the disastrous issues & he comped our desserts; however even though she was aware of the freebie, because she reiterated the plans of free dessert as stated by the manager; little miss sunshine STILL charged us for the cheesecake (crickets); we felt like this should've been an episode of Punk'd!!!  *****Reasons for AT LEAST 2 Stars***** Extensive menu, lots to choose from.

I was like okay we have a seat and can order. Well I didn't know I was going to play server all night. I sat in the middle and was passing food and drink, plates and trash back and forth all night. The plates when they came out were on fire with no assistance I had to pass not one but 2 hot plates, which burned my hands, that didn't even phase the waitress.

72,Katie S.,"Metairie, LA",194,116,716.0,2.0,2014-09-06,"So I went here once and had a pretty good experience. Since then I felt the need to update my review because the last few times I've been here they have ""run out"" of my favorite menu items, which I found a bit odd. The bartender explained to me that they pre-make everything in the kitchen the day before to a certain quantity, so they only have a limited supply of certain menu items for that day. So, if you go anytime in the late afternoon or at night, there's a big chance they will have already run out of a few popular menu items. I have came here 3 times since, and 2 of those times I was told that they had ran out of my favorite item of macaroni and cheese bites. Such a shame! I literally go there specifically for that crispy fried macaroni and cheese fix! But that's not the only thing that runs out, apparently several other items tend to run out pretty frequently as well. You would think this should be a pretty easy problem to solve. Just prep for more orders on popular menu items that constantly run out right? Well....nope....corporate has rules apparently that prevent that from happening. The staff is usually pretty apologetic about it and sweet but it sort of turned me off a bit knowing that if I come for something in particular I have a 50/50 shot that they might not even have it.

I ordered the chicken & ""biscuits"", even though it only came with one biscuit. The chicken was a little thick, although it was pretty moist. It was just bland. The ""pan drippings/gravy"" was just ok; again bland. The mashed potatoes - excellent! The biscuit was stale. It comes with mixed veggies, but I asked to substitute broccoli. Unfortunately, the broccoli comes covered in mushrooms. I wish I would've known that. I I HATE mushrooms. It also came covered in onions, of which I had no problem. Just not worth $16 in my opinion.

Just kidding,  I knew the menu was extensive just making fun of how extensive. Carly behind the bar easily guided me telling me where to look, by page number no less, for what I was in the mood for. I asked her favorite burger and she mentioned the Americano(sp) burger which I happily went for with a side of sweet potato fries. I also started with a side salad as I felt really piggish today. Since I'm in the industry I had several questions which Carly was more than happy to answer. As we were talking I told her I work just down the street. That's when she informed me we had actually met when she was having dinner at my establishment.  The salad and burger was everything I was expecting. However, I would have like a little more time between the salad and burger. The burger arrived before I really had begun to tackle the salad.  The gluttony continued after the burger with a piece of upside down pineapple cheesecake.  Needless to say I'll be walking this meal off for the next few days.  Overall it was a great lunch.

Our entrees were huge, but terrible.  I had the bang-bang shrimp and chicken.  All I could taste was toasted coconut.  I even tried pushing the coconut to the side, but then the shrimp and chicken was bland - not the curry flavor I was hoping for.  I could not eat it.  My husband had the Spicy Chicken Cashew.  All he could taste was heat, but little flavor.  If fact, it did not even taste fresh.  One son got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - again heat, but very little flavor.  My daughter had the Margarita Pizza.  The flavor was OK but it was room temperature when brought to the table.  All four of us could not eat our meals.  The only one that did eat the entire entree was my other son that got the Grilled Ribeye Steak. I will say that our server was great and immediately got the manager when he saw that four of us had barely touched our meals.  The manager had no personality.  Made no apologies except to say that people either love or hate the bang-bang shrimp.  Why serve something that so many people end up hating???  But he did not charge us for the entrees not eaten.

Hostess was extremely lazy and rude and was just standing there gossiping with another hostess (there wasn't a wait time or anything). When she finally seats me, she just flings the menu my way. NOT A WORD. It took about 15 MINUTES to be acknowledged by my server and only because I stood up and asked one at random ""who is my server?"". Turns out, she is my server. She passed by my table so many times by the way, and not so much a glance came my way. She very nonchalantly said ""Oh, it's me. What do you want?"" like it was normal for a customer to approach her just to get a freaking glass of water.  I completely understand when a restaurant is busy and the service is slow. But when you see your server just stand there talking and laughing with her coworkers while dishes are piling up everywhere and people are waiting for their checks, it is extremely off-putting.

123,E b.,"Kenner, LA",23,69,588.0,2.0,2015-01-07,"DO NOT ORDER EVELYNS FAVORITE PASTA!! Sorry, but I had to put that out there first. I have been here twice. 20-30 minute wait both times. The first time was for my birthday with my bf. We waited by the bar and ordered frozen drinks while we waited. Delicious but not very potent. Seating:  I hate the seating! The lighting is intimate but the seating is not. They have everyone seated so close together, I could hear the people next to us smacking their lips as they ate. We were seated next to a group of cackling hens. At the table: They serve nice warm bread with pats of butter first. We order mac and cheese balls for appetizers. I have to say that was so good!!!  I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering Evelyns favorite pasta. Its like a mixed pasta with veges in it. I actually gagged at the first bite. Thinking maybe I probably needed to stir it up some, I took a second and third bite. It tasted even worse.  I told the waitress how awful it was and she was very accommodating. I was allowed to order something else (and agreed that that dish was just nasty).   Meanwhile, my bf was chomping on his KOBE BEEF BURGER with swiss. As I waited for the waitress to return with the menu, my bf looked like he was enjoying that dang burger way too much. So I asked him for a bite. This burger was yummy...wait let me say that again...YUMMY! It was big enough for two. So when the waitress finally came back with the menu, I said ""I already know what I want! I want exactly what he's having...except with sweet potato fries!""  Well, we were full off his burger and just took mine to go...which ended becoming his lunch for work...kobe beef lunch. Must be nice. Yaaaaas, thank you, it was. Anyway, we couldn't get that kobe beef off our minds so we decided to go back a second time... with a game plan. It seems their servings are ample enough for two, so I find the prices somewhat reasonable for the amount of food you get. We got seated in a different area but it was still too close for comfort. Im beginning to believe that the dim lightning isnt for ambiance,  but so you dont see the people next to you chew their food!  We got the same sweet waitress and I was straightfoward, "" We're gonna split a kobe beef burger and a cheesecake."" Just like that. She even gave me an extra plate for my half. I filled up on that dang bread they serve in advanced. So when i got my burger, I couldn't even finish half of that half...bummer. (Not for him, though. He ate the rest.) We sat around talking, letting the food digest and then ordered BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. Im glad we only ordered one, bc that sucka was big. It was good, but we were hoping the banana slices were in it...not around it. It also had ALOT of whipped cream with it. Whipped cream is good. Heck, it's great!!! In this case, it only serves to fill the empty spaces on plate...which is ok. Overall, the food is pretty good. If you dont like it, they will accommodate. (That doesnt mean eat half way through the dish you didn't like!!) The server we had was very nice. Pricewise... I would say it would have been worth it if I wasnt surprised and dissapointed with it being a 'nice..but not really' restaurant. The atmosphere is set up to give you higher end expectancies, but the crowd and seating are not what you get. I go in there dressed for a nice evening out and there is a mish mosh of heels, work shoes and flip flops walking around. It's off putting.  My friend had to remind me that CF is attached to a mall so I should expect the mall crowd to show up.  Oh and did I mention..don't order Evelyns Favorite Pasta and seating sucks.

Our server was attentive and we never had to ask for anything. She was funny as well, several times we heard plates crashing and she was like 'it wasn't me' she was just fun. One thing that I am still unable to wrap my mind around is the fact this place has a 21 page menu! That was not a typo----21 pages!! This made choosing what to order more than overwhelming and when I see places with such giant menus I can't help but assume there is no way a restaurant is going to do that many things well. I mean, I feel like these type of menus are all about pleasing the pants off everyone in the universe verses (like I said) making every single dish amazing in its own right.  I prefer places that have smaller menus that do what they do on a smaller scale but that do everything really really well.  On to the food.  The presentation was well above average for a mega-chain. The sesame bun was fantastic and the plate just looked really nice all around. They give you some blue cheese dressing on the side and it was just ok, nothing amazing. The sweet potato fries were great and they were presented in a little metal canister with wax paper which was a nice touch.  I did not order cheesecake because I pretty much don't like sweets of any kind. However my friend is a cheesecake aficionado and he really enjoyed himself.

60,Brittany G.,"Metairie, LA",129,148,419.0,1.0,2015-10-26,"Yikes! This was the worst dining experience I have had in some time. I do not like giving bad reviews and this is my first 1 star review (I've written around 60 reviews). This restaurant makes me sad because it has so much potential. I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory in other states, and I have had great experiences. The really sad thing about this place is that it seems to be getting worse. Right when a restaurant opens, it is expected that there may be some confusion/mistakes happening. I went here a few weeks after it first opened and had a good experience (4 stars). My grandma and I came here a few months ago and had a mediocre experience (3 stars) due to lackluster service and wilted lettuce for my chicken lettuce cups. This most recent time, last Saturday, is what is making me give the restaurant only 1 star because of how bad it's slipping. I went with two of my friends and one of them brought their child (a 3 year old). My friends did take awhile to order due to the complexity of the menu. I ordered a lunch special which was a half chicken salad sandwich/soup/and a side salad for 11.50. I saw on the menu that if you wanted a the side salad to be a caesar salad then it was an upgrade, I decided not to do that and chose a different dressing. My two friends both ordered salads for their meals. My friend ordered her daughter chicken strips off of the kid's menu. About 20 minutes later, the waitress comes up and tells us that because a dish broke that they could no longer serve salads? We would have to re-order. I didn't feel like going through the long menu, so I told her to keep my order and just not to worry about the side salad. Both of my friends re-ordered and chose the turkey-guac sandwich with fries. Twenty more minutes go by and a young man, who I am assuming was the manager, comes up and tell us that they actually can make salads, but they do not have any turkey. They have been out of turkey for a month. What?!?!?! Why are these items still listed on the menu if you've been out for a month? So my friends go back to their original order of the salads after being in this restaurant for almost an hour. My friend's daughter was getting very antsy at this point. About 5 minutes later, the kid's meal comes out. Five more minutes go by and my food comes out with a side caesar salad. Ten minutes and my friend's salads come out. I tell the waitress that I did not want the caesar dressing (I really didn't feel like being charged more). The waitress takes it away and tells me that she will pack me the one that I ordered to take home. The baked potato soup was pretty good (it was different but still yummy), but the chicken salad sandwich was nothing to write home about. We got our checks, but I never got my salad to go. I didn't care about it enough to wait another 15 minutes. Overall, we spent entirely too long and too much money. Next time I will go to La Madeleine's if I want chicken salad, soup, or salad.

Every time we dine here, at least once every other week,  we notice that most of the waiters and waitress are new.  We've had some good ones in the past, but every now and then we get one that is clueless. Why can't the kitchen turn out a tables food all at the same time. I've noticed other tables experiencing the same problem.  Please get on track as we like your restaurant however, with over 1,400 other restaurant in our area, if this continues and the problems not addressed, we will not be returning to your restaurant.

183,A. B.,"Metairie, LA",0,6,,2.0,2016-01-13,"This place is a hit or miss. Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The place wasn't packed and we were seated quickly. Our waiter came and got our drinks. Our complimentary bread took forever getting to us, but when it did, it was warm. I ordered Steak Diane medium. When I got the steak, the outside was burnt and when I cut into it, it was super dry. When our waiter came and asked if everything was okay, I asked for steak sauce. I usually don't eat steak sauce but I was hoping it would help with the dryness...nope. I stopped eating and when our waiter came back, he asked if I needed a box. I asked him if they could make this meal again since my steak was dry, the waiter goes, ""I came by and asked if everything was okay earlier."" Dead silence. Then he went to get the manager. The manager came over and I explained to her what happened. Everything was fine till the steak came out, I ordered medium and it was well done. She explained that since the steak was cut in small portions, the steak gets dry fast. Um, okay. I told her I usually eat my steak well but ordered my steak medium in case they cooked it too well. I cut the rest of the steak on my plate to show her how super well done it was. Also, I told her I didn't want to complain to the waiter so I asked for steak sauce hoping that would help me finish the steak. She wasn't rude and offered to make me a new plate, which I did take upon that offer. I was surprised by the waiter and manager's excuses to my problem before handing it a better way. I had 80% of food on my plate before I complained, its not like I ate everything and said something.

I'd  go as far to say they are my favorite chain restaurant. BUT... this location is severely lacking on all fronts. When I walked in the door, no wait the hostess was off in space and then started screaming at a woman across the way...over and over ""MISS LORETTA MISS LORRETTA"" who also apparently was good at ignoring people so the hostess was forced to do her job a seat us. The restaurant was pretty empty so we had a choice of seats but the hostess tries to put us right in front of the bathroom. I kindly said would it be possible to sit away from the bathroom and she said oh..how about here...the table also next the the bathroom on the other side of the entrance. I wuzzz like ummmm is there a difference???UMMM AAAWWAAAYY from the bathroom in your empty restaurant pahleezzz.  Next our waiter greated us and was nice although the drinks seemed to have been forgotten a few times and we got that look from him (you know the one) ohh YEAHH...their drinks.  That nice.. yet forgetful attitude carried it's way thru the meal.  Finally the veggie melt I ordered came out and half the ingredients such as avocado, goat cheese artichoke, roasted red peppers were not on the sandwich and I guess they figured they could just put mushroom, zucchini and bell peppers instead. Not that it couldn't be a nice sandwich but I hate mushrooms and it's not what the ingredients listed on the menu were. I went and grabbed a menu and showed the waiter what I had ordered and showed him the sandwich. He was like Ohhh did u want them to remake it? Yes..yes I do. 30 minutes went by and no sandwich and finally just told him I needed to go. A manager of sorts came by to apologize and said he would bring the sandwich right back to go and take it off the bill  I said ok. 10 more minutes the waiter comes back and hands us the bill but still no sandwich. Finally got it and left and went home. Checked the box when I got home and although it was closer to the menu description it was still not as described on their menu.  I even mentioned it was my birthday and you would think maybe they would do a little something to make it a little less horrible. NOPE! Id hate to see how this branch operates when they are actually busy. They defiantly need to work on things.

I didn't really know what to expect from a national chain, but I kept an open mind. We came on a Thursday evening and the place was PACKED. Seriously, there was a 20 minute wait and I was pretty surprised. I guess because it's attached to the mall it gets a lot of action. Anyway, after waiting for a bit we were seated and given the huge super long menu they have. It pretty much has everything on here you could want from burgers and fish to ribs and their version of Thai food- no kidding. I decided to get the fried catfish which came with sides of mashed potatoes, corn and green beans. When the food came, I was immediately impressed by the portion- three good sized pieces of catfish and generous amounts of sides. The fish was cooked nicely with a thin crust and had a good flavor. The sides were okay- my favorite was the mashed potatoes but I could have done without the green beans as they were a bit under cooked for my liking. All in all, dinner was good and more than I expected from a chain. Since we were at the Cheesecake Factory, naturally I had to try some of the good stuff. I got the Hershey's Cheesecake and not only were they generous with the portion, but it was delicious! It was basically a chocolate bomb and I had to stop myself from scarfing down the entire thing. As for service- our waiter was a bit slow, but that was only because the dining room was full. The guy was still very sweet, so it wasn't a huge deal. While I wouldn't rush back to Cheesecake Bistro, I wouldn't balk if I ended up here for dinner again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=40,2.32,2.37,2.37,2.48,2.35

Well, the floor manager came up to apologize that my husband's side of corn had taken nearly 30 minutes, and thats when i told him i couldn't eat my meal. He gladly convinced me to choose something else, which i choose the parmesan crusted chicken. I got it fairly quickly, and soon after my husband finally got his corn, which was bland as hell. My new meal was delicious, but i felt too disgusted to eat. Ordered 2 slices of cheesecake, which are pretty dense and oversized.

218,Jessica C.,"Slidell, LA",0,2,,4.0,2016-05-14,"I look forward to going to Cheesecake Factory.  We had been to one, several years ago, in King of Prussia Mall.  Back then, they had more choices of burgers, including some with goat cheese and avocado.  It seems they've scaled back on the burger choices, which is disheartening.  But I had fallen in love with the raspberry lemon cheesecake, which they still have.  They also have a great mango key lime cheesecake.  I am one who prefers a tart cheesecake as opposed to a very sweet cheesecake, so the lemon and key lime choices are great.  I have ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta several times.  I have also gotten the Cobb salad and a few of the burgers.  I do enjoy the food and the bread.  My mom enjoys the salmon.  If you're a fan of bleu cheese dressing, make sure to get a salad.  Not everything comes with a salad, but, if you don't like a particular side item that comes with an entree, you can usually substitute a salad.  For example, you could choose a salad instead of the mashed potatoes.  They sometimes bring out a sizable container of dressing for the salad.  If your salad comes with dressing already on it, it's no problem to ask for extra dressing.  As for the service, it is kind of hit or miss.  We had gone after a Saints game, one late Sunday afternoon, and there was a shift change, so it seemed like we were temporarily forgotten.  My mom put in a complaint about the service through email, I think, after our visit.  Probably a few months later, they were just getting to read the email!  But someone did call and offer a free slice of cheesecake.  When we went back, the service was fabulous.  The next time, good service, but then, yesterday, back to slow service, again. And that was at an earlier lunch time.  The waitress was very pleasant, but the food took forever.  My mom ordered a salad to substitute for a side item that came with her salmon, assuming the salad would come out first (which it had in the past), but it didn't.  In fact, the waitress brought out the salad dressing about 20 minutes before the salad came.  Then everything was coming out at once.  She is a slow eater, so she ended up giving me some of her salad so that she wouldn't feel so rushed.  One special perk, though, we got a survey on our receipt to do online, and we get $5 off of our next visit.  We will definitely go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2?start=200,2.52,2.44,2.44,2.448,2.472

The downside is it is inconsistent, the service is hot or miss, and some items on the menu are too salty for my taste. My favorite items are the Tex Mex egg rolls, omelets, and the cheesecake, of course.  The chicken salad was the least favorite item I had, too salty. The chicken pot pie had a strange flavor, and lacked CHICKEN.   I think the place has atmosphere, and potential, but the service is usually sub par, .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-metairie-2,2.2,2.5,2.5,,2.38

We arrived at 7 P.M.. There was not a line so our table wait was very short. This was my first time here but my date had been here before. I found the atmosphere quite pleasant. We were escorted to our table and shortly after being seated our waiter arrived. Everyone was nice and our waiter was prompt and attentive.  We ordered our food and drinks and received them within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the seared Ahi Tuna dish and my date ordered the fried shrimp dish. She was not too pleased with her choice. She said it was alright but that was about it. The Ahi Tuna on the other hand was very good. I felt like the amount of tuna was a little small and it did not come with a side dish. All-in-all it was a good first experience but certainly nothing to write home about.  I tried to make a reservation but was told that they do not take reservations for Friday and the weekend, only for Monday thru Thursday.

Our server introduced herself as Kelly and she was very attentive. Took drink orders and came back with that and the bread they give you with the slab of butter. We ordered the crispy crab bites as an appetizer and our entrees came off the lunch menu. My mom got the herb crusted salmon which comes with a lemon glaze underneath and a bed of mashed potatoes w/ asparagus. I got the Cheesecake Factory famous meatloaf which also comes with mashed potatoes and corn maque choux. The app was basically little ball sized crab cakes with a side of I think they called it mustard sauce? These were good, really crispy on the outside. My lunch portion was HUGE. It came with 2 slices of the meatloaf smothered in a mushroom and onion gravy. I really liked it and I'm pretty picky so that's a plus. My mom liked her salmon a lot and ended up finishing it. We had a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake to share and that topped of the meal. The prices are very reasonable esp for lunch and those portions! I can imagine a dinner size then. My tea was always refilled and we were checked on often.

I'm guessing because we spent like $100 the morning before we were being economical. But tid was a mistake.  We both ordered from the brunch menu. I had Green Chilaquiles with carnitas and eggs, pork version. My partner had the Fried chicken & Waffles  Benedict. In both orders the eggs were ... I mean I don't mind a soft scramble but this was gross mush. For the chicken and waffles my partner asked for scrambled eggs on the side. They put the wet mushy eggs like yellow stuff on top of the waffle. The syrup taste like butter. The chicken batter was nothing. Like not seasoned. Just bland.  Green Chilaquiles with carnitas and egg. I'm not trying to be gross but as I tried to eat it, it started to look like a thrown up omelette. It was like omelette soup. It also lacked flavor. And structure and I asked to the sever to take it away because it made me want to throw up. And I'm sure if I had it's look just as it was presented to me.

24,Michelle B.,"Fairgrounds, New Orleans, LA",81,330,6800.0,5.0,2017-11-07,"So normally I would give this place 4 stars but the service from Alex and Mary plus the food (definitely get the Pasta Napoletana and the Pasta with sausage and shrimp, and of course the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!) pushes it over to 5 stars! I remember when this joint first opened and it was packed! Hehe we're slow in getting things in Louisiana and Cheesecake Factory is no exception! I have very fond memories of going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock Building when I lived in Chicago. I don't even remember what I ate but knew it was always good, the menu was ridiculously long and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake was divine! So for this visit one of my best friends and his friend and I enjoyed a relatively quiet Monday night. We didn't have to wait which was fantastic. I didn't even realize how huge this place is with two huge areas for outdoor seating. This is fantastic for down here bc patio seating is life! I definitely recommend asking for Alex as your waiter. He had great recommendations, refilled drinks before they were even empty and was attentive! And Mary was very kind in checking on us too asking how everything was! As for food I really enjoyed the Pasta Napoletana which Alex described as a dish trying to be a pizza. And if you're like me you're pouring the grated fresh Parmesan on top of it! And hey, my bestie didn't use all of his Parmesan cheese so I got the other half of his too' hehe can you tell I love my cheese?  I would also try a regular on the menu which is the Pasta with sausage and shrimp. Normally I don't like spicy things but this dish has the right amount of kick to it!  And of course we came here for the cheesecake but were so full we took it to go. My personal favorite is the Godiva chocolate cheesecake but my friend's white chocolate macadamia nut caramel and salted caramel one looked amazing! They also have a bar and a large circular table at the end! This would be great for large groups!

It tasted good, but I've had better from Chinese take out. My boyfriend had the shrimp scampi. We are the type of people that look at the menu online before we eat out, and the scampi looked nothing like the picture on the website! It was very buttery, but he liked it. We loved our cocktails, Irish whiskey coffee & typhoon punch. Excellent chocolate cake. Serve Bitney was attentive and checked on is regularly.

First they recommend that you order it ahead of time so I did that and then I called to make sure my order was ready on the day that I was supposed to pick it up and the person who took my order did not even put it in. Their website also does not tell you that the half of a cheesecake for $25-$30 is per half not for the whole thing. I ended up having to pay $65 to get a half-and-half cheesecake after believing that it was going to be $30 as the website indicates. I could not even get the flavor that I ordered because of the incompetent person at the bakery who did not put my order in I had to choose something else.

Sometimes that's just what you're looking for and that's fine, but mostly that is what keeps me away.

If you want to eat here make sure you have time to spare because you will be here a while no matter what you decide to order. I've never had anything bad to eat here, but I have noticed that the food itself will be luke warm and the plate it's on is scalding hot. I don't understand that at all.
