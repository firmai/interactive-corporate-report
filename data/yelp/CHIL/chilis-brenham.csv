Robert V.,"Spring, TX",8,24,,5.0,4/4/2016,"We set up this location as a meeting spot. We had a great experience! The food was delicious, compared to other locations we've been to, and the service was great! The restaurant was clean. I'm trying to think of a negative experience, but nothing comes to mind! A great experience all around!  Food tip: get the loaded baked potato soup! Wow! I could eat that all day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Hope B.,"Brenham, TX",69,66,8,1.0,7/30/2017,"No, just no. I hate chain restaurants.. but this place is awful. The food is bad, everything is expensive and don't go when it's starting to get dark or you'll start to see cockroaches climbing up the wall by your table.. or over the host stand.. word of advice if you do go.. don't take a toothpick..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Brian J.,"McAllen, TX",47,83,265,2.0,4/3/2016,"Looks like they had a busy weekend and none of the 17 kids they have working has done any cleaning. I ordered take out and the entire take out area was disgusting. You could see into the kitchen and it was OK, but the guest area made me feel dirty. So I went to the restroom to see how they were maintained. They were just as bad as the take out area. Looked as if they haven't been cleaned in hours. At least the soap and towel dispenser were full and automatic so I didn't have to touch anything. I only came here because there are very limited options in Brenhan, Texas on Sunday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Kimberly T.,"Brenham, TX",7,9,7,1.0,4/1/2017,"Specifically ordered a classic 6 oz steak dry... I guess next time I have to tell them no sauce. The steak came out with some type of sauce and avocado on top. Next I ordered the house salad only with tomato, cucumber, and red onion...the house salad came out with a spring mix with blue cheese. When I sent the order back in the steak had butter garlic sauce on it, not dry as what I requested. My salad had croutons with salad dressing, not as requested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Eddie H.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",79,5,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Not prepared for a crowd on Saturday night.  One bartender for a full bar.  When we tried to order drinks the bartender told us if we don't have a seat he can't make us drinks.  Very rude and unprofessional, a good bartender should make every accommodation to the customer to serve drinks. Waitress was very flustered & seemed out of control, kept complaining we were in her way at the bar and she couldn't do her job.  Completely unprofessional all the way around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Madison B.,"San Marcos, TX",7,27,22,5.0,4/14/2017,"I've been here many times and never had any problems. My favorite area to sit is the bar, I always get great service. The food is quick and correct and I always enjoy my visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Lynn S.,"Leander, TX",0,27,1,4.0,8/26/2016,"Very nice meal. We sat at the bar because there was a 20 minute wait. The bartender was Eli. He was amazing. He worked hard the entire time we were there. He made sure to keep our drinks full, and checked on us frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",224,89,158,3.0,9/12/2015,Nicely located...however it's a smaller location. Came in after a Brenham football game. Was seated fairly fast however it was dishes on every table it seems. The server escorted us to our table & we were crunching chips under our feet. As more people came in the employees started cleaning tables. Our food came out fast & was hot. It's a nice establishments however management needs to keep it clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Robert B.,"Houston, TX",42,419,809,3.0,4/22/2014,"The is one of the smaller Chili's I have been to.  Server did well even though she got a couple things wrong or messed up. But she corrected them well. Ordered the spinach artichoke dip. It was okay. Certainly not the best. But ehhhhh Had the carnitas and steak fajita. It was surprisingly good. Steak was cooked medium and pork came out very lean. Onions and green peppers where semi-charred and well seasoned.  But the best part was their 6 sample of different topping to put on your fajitas. Pico de galo. Guac. Shredded Cheese, and a pickled onion and jalapeño salsa which was super tasty.  All and all it was tasty for a change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Christina B.,"Katy, TX",47,24,5,3.0,5/24/2016,"This location was really small, but given the location I wasn't surprised.  My waitress was friendly, and checked on us frequently.  The chips and salsa was surprisingly delicious, and the chips were served hot.  I have always been a fan of the fact you pay and go, no waiting on the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Dennis W.,"La Porte, TX",94,36,45,3.0,1/31/2016,Service was slow. The fries were over-seasoned. The appetizer onion rings were not that great. Food took forever to arrive and was just average tasting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Kevin G.,"Katy, TX",0,13,9,5.0,7/24/2016,"Clayton was one of the best servers we have had at Chili's.  Very professional, helpful and friendly.  Food was tasty and plentiful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Ashley F.,"Houston, TX",21,31,12,4.0,3/8/2015,"Our waitress was really nice. The food was good! The game system is .99 unlimited use which we highly enjoyed, before you knew it our food was served, the 45 minutes passed quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Kim C.,"Cedar Park, TX",31,19,1,1.0,11/15/2015,"Stopped in with the family on the way back to Austin from the Texas Renaissance Festival.  First impression - looked like the floor hadn't been swept all day.  The service was so-so.  The food was terrible; bland steaks, lukewarm soups; tasted like everything had been pre-cooked, frozen and then microwaved.  Even the menu choices have become boring and stale. I think I'm over eating at Chili's in general and at this Chili's location in particular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Maria A.,"Texas City, TX",0,3,1,5.0,5/18/2014,"This location is personally our favorite, and we never have problems with service when we come here. Service is always attentive, bartenders know how to make their drinks, food is excellent (and we're very picky with our Chilis).  Today was second to worst service we ever had in any restaurant. Food was just as good as always, but everything else made us feel that we've spent too much. Menus in the lounge area had old food on them. We were the first ones to sit down, but we were the last ones to get served. Once we ordered our margaritas we were never even offered waters, and we had really missed them when we got our drinks which were REALLY strong. The pomegranate margarita, which usually is light, was strong compared to presidente. It took quite a bit of time for our waitress to come back to check on the drinks, and we got our replacement as we were getting our food. It seemed that our waitress worried about everyone else but us, which is interesting because we had ordered drinks, and expected to be checked on more often. When we got our check we were disappointed to pay because the service was not worth the $40. Just to clarify, when it comes to service we expect the best because in our field, my husband and I would do our best, we just want to be treated the way we expect others want to be treated.  We definitely recommend coming here, but the experience we had today was awful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Tonya C.,"Hempstead, TX",5,44,9,1.0,4/18/2015,here's what to expect if you decide to eat here food that tastes similar to a hotpocket it was the worst food I've eaten in a while my drink never went empty for long but the food was terrible I would have to say eating here was a bad life choice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Richard K.,"Shiner, TX",6,93,26,1.0,8/23/2014,no lunch menu on weekends. computers and self pay at the tables. fast food experience for dine in prices,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Joe P.,"Tomball, TX",0,15,2,1.0,4/11/2014,Worst Chilis on the planet.   Service takes horrible to a new level.  I should have made any other choice.  Stay away from this crap hole.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Jarom A.,"Pearland, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/10/2015,"I was in town and we decided to go here for dinner. We called ahead and were told they would hold a table for us when we showed up five minutes later they had given the table away, and that they weren't allowed to hold tables for customers. we were told 15-20 minutes. 45 minutes later we finally had our table. every time we asked what was going on we were told oh, they're wiping the table now. extremely poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Catherine H.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,206,20,3.0,6/21/2011,"Ok, so im not a BIG fan of franchise resturants such as Chilis, its just so... plain jane, and I for one am not a plain jane type of gal...  Food - typical american food.. bleh! I had the Avacado salad with a sweet tea!  Lets see, the only thing that i liked about this particular chilis is that its in my home town and alot of my high school friends work here! I had the best server! Guy White! He was defitnely on point with the good service! From what I hear, the margaritas are good as well! :)  Thats all I can really say for this review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham
Jeffrey S.,"Brenham, TX",17,368,77,2.0,2/3/2011,"It's chili's...you know what you're gonna get. My order was ""to go"" and as usual something wasn't correct. I received a TexMex version (bell peppers, grilled onions, and no romaine lettuce) of a chicken caesar wrap. Chili's is good if you have no other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brenham?start=20
