And with this Red Robin location in the same parking lot as the mall, we wouldn't have to move the car through the killer traffic before eating. SOLD.  I went with my RR staple, the Bonzai Burger with bottomless fries and a strawberry freckled lemonade. The burger itself was totally fine, but the fries, which they're known for, were absolutely awful. They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. I'm pretty sure I got the last remnants of the batch because on the way out of the restaurant, I saw some decent looking fries on other tables.  My wife ordered the chicken caesar salad and chicken-tortilla soup. The salad was pretty good she said, but the soup was terrible. It had also been obviously sitting out for a while, so the tortillas were completely soggy when it arrived at the table and there was hardly any chicken in it.

However, with that having been said, the food and drink are Red Robin, meaning they're really good. I tried their Blue Moon/Svedka cocktail in a can, and that was the best decision I've made in weeks. Their Gardenburger is yummy and made even better with the addition of avocado slices. I do also love the concept of endless steak fries as well, as theirs are hot, crunchy, and well-seasoned.  Give it a shot.

It was a beautiful day out, but it was definitely too cold in the restaurant. So we asked if we could sit outside and were told to go ahead out there. The waitress told us she would be right out. She never came out. Another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped and took our order.  The outdoor section was also unkempt. One table not cleared after people had eaten.  Waitress was very friendly, took our order and came back with water. Food came quickly: I had the Red Robin burger and hubby had the Smoke & Fire burger. Both burgers were good, although hubby asked for his pink in middle and it was cooked all the way through. I had sweet potato fries and he had steak fries.

Our waitress was very attentive but with the new gadget Robin on each table she was only needed to take our entree order and drink refills. For what we paid for our burgers and the taste any quality of our food, it just isn't worth going back. Hell they even charged a $2.00 entertainment fee! Wtf was that for?

17,Angela C.,"Charleston, SC",4,33,8.0,1.0,2015-11-06,"So far this entire dining experience leaves me wishing we had just gotten burgers at a fast food place. The waiter took forever to come get our drink order. He seemed frazzled like maybe he was overwhelmed with the 5 tables he had.  We ordered drinks and our meals at the same time as our food as we had more than ample time to look at the menu.  Our drinks finally arrived and my margarita was probably the most poorly made margarita I've ever had. It tasted like I was drinking sweet and sour mix straight from the cup. There were no straws to stir it so I walked to the bar to get some. The bartender was rude and asked ""oh you want straws. We don't have any"". This restaurant charges for extremely overpriced burgers and can't afford stir straws?!?!???  I managed to choke down the margarita without breathing so I wouldn't taste it as the waiter did not care that I said it was disgusting with no offer to replace it. I ordered a bottled beer instead thinking they couldn't mess that up. I was wrong. Instead of my bottled hard root beer, he brought it serves over ice cream, which I did not order and which cost $4 MORE than just the beer. I said fine don't worry about it, as my beer sat on the bar for 5 mins before I even got it and didn't want to wait another 5 mins for a drink (I was in full view of the bar and timed it).  The burgers were decent as usual. Not worth $15, but tasted good. I was not able to finish the root beer float concoction because it was not only very heavy with a large burger, but because it tasted terrible.  The bartender and waiter were both unconcerned with our complaints and we paid the check in full. I didn't make a huge issue of it, I just wanted to leave.  I WILL NOT be returning to this particular Red Robin due to the terrible service and poor attitude of a very untrained bartender.

Burgers tasted like they are precooked over the flame grill, then just barely heated up to serve. 1 was ordered well done, and came out quite pink. Neither burger was hot (hence my theory of precooking and re-heating). The buns disintegrated before we were 1/2 done - I ended up using a knife & fork for almost 1/2 my burger. The fries were awesome, but it did take quite a while for the 'refills' to arrive.

He was courteous, and he came back just enough to let us know he hadn't forgotten us while not feeling like he was being intrusive. We recieved GREAT service. Thank you, Louis. The food on the other hand was not so great. Specifically, the macaroni and cheese. I got some kind of burger, and it was delicious. However I'm concerned about the quality of meat served because I wasn't allowed to have my burger served rare. That is usually an indication that the meat is not too quality. My BOTTOMLESS sweet potato fries were also spot on.  My husband got a different burger and macaroni and cheese. It was quite literally just cooked macaroni with melted cheese in top. No seasonings.

55,Tisha S.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,2,,1.0,2016-02-17,"For starters, I work at a local chain restaurant around the corner so I know how the business can go on behind the scences so I am not a typical ""entitled"" patron.  Ok, I hadn't been to this location in years and couldn't quite remember why not. My fiance kept bugging me about eating here so when we were in Raleigh the other day we dined in for lunch and both LOVED the food. We decided to go to this location in Fayetteville yesterday and I can now remember why I wasn't impressed initially.  Our servers name was Lisa? and she greeted us within a reasonable time. My fiance and I ordered the chilli cheese fries (which were actually good) and then the same exact thing I had ordered at the last location..the insaine romaine salad. It is two very large wedges of romaine heads grilled and drizzled with Caesar dressing and parmesan as well as a grilled chicken breast.  So here's the real review. As she was carrying the plates out I was just hoping that it wasn't our food. From afar it looked unappealing. She sets the food in front of us and it looks as though the cook got a little negligent with our lettuce on the grill, it was very scorched. Not only that but the lettuce looked as though it needed to be thrown out a week ago, it had so much slimy mushy parts. The chicken breast was so dry. I tried a few bites and was just over it as well as my fiance. Well there was no way to tell that to the server because she didn't come back to our table for quite some time. the same with the other location as well. (Maybe I'm a little biased by my restaurants ""3 minute bite check"" ) so we just ate it as to not be a ""bother"" or difficult. Nor did we want to wait any longer for someone to walk by. when she did come back I was a good way through the salad, but that's not why she returned. She asked if we were paying card or cash and if we were familiar with the tablet to pay on. I said yes and her response was something like ""okay! No rush I just wanted to make sure I didn't need to come back over here for anything"" ummmmm what???? Needless to say our drinks NEVER got refilled. And no she never did return...at all. These tablets are allowing the sever to become complacent and thats the experience from BOTH restaurants. I'm typically a very generous tipper as I know the struggle, even when they are crappy and I am teaching my fiance this concept. I literally give him a lecture every time. I didn't even bother asking if he tipped or how much as I was so disappointed that I could've cared less. We at least paid for the crappy food that's the most we owed them.

We had a server by the name of Nicole and she was not attentive whatsoever.  We waited over 40 minutes to get our food.  She had offered to bring fries in between our wait, but that never happened.  In those 40 minutes she only checked on us once.  Super unhappy with the service we received here.  I was tempted to not leave her a tip but I did.  Management seriously needs to look into hiring servers that will be attentive.  A busy night or not, servers should be checking on the customers.  By the way it was not a super busy night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
5,Shawn W.,"Hope Mills, NC",0,13,,1.0,2017-12-16,"We went to Red Robin for my son's birthday. After being lead to a booth, we waited for 25 minute with no one to ask for drinks or anything. It wasn't crowded as it was on a Monday about 6:45pm. Well the four of us got up and began walking out with still no one stopping to ask if we been served. We've been here a few times and this was terrible, and I told the girl up front that it was my son's birthday. Thanks for a great birthday dinner! NOT!!! Never eating here ever again. We ended up going to Bubba's 33 and had a great time, great service, awesome  food, the manager even ask how was our food was and even a birthday surprise for my son.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
2,Kira B.,"South Haven, MI",6,17,40.0,2.0,2017-12-20,"This is my first visit to a Red Robin. I have to say that this review is more influenced by our server. She started by walking up, offering us the bottomless root beer floats only to promptly tell us we couldn't have them when one of our party ordered one. She was very slow to refill the bottomless drinks and fries and instead stood at a table behind us to flirt with two guys (which is where she spent most of her time).  We asked if we could switch our drink refills to a different bottomless drink and she informed us that we would be charged more if we did. We are not sure of the validity of her information, but we all believed her to be incorrect. Why would they charge us more for a different bottomless drink that was the same price or less expensive?  We ordered some pretzel bites, which came with half of a small container of dipping cheese for a large amount of pretzels. I had to ask three times for extra cheese before she bothered to come back with it and seemed overall disinterested in serving us.  The food came out relatively quick considering our larger party, but the garlic fries and burger buns were soggy with grease. Aside from the soggy bread, the burger was above average but nothing to write home about. The sweet potato fries were pretty good though.  Once we paid, the waitress never came back and ignored us. We were still eating and awaiting refills. We waited over 20 minutes before we eventually went up and asked for them.  Overall,  I think I'll pass on visiting Red Robin in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
1,Krisna S.,"Charlotte, NC",37,77,27.0,2.0,2017-12-28,"I love Red Robin but I don't like it here. They're so stingy with the ""bottomless"" fries and the hostess was such a jerk.  We came in at a busy-ish time, so, I let the hostility slide. After ordering, the waitress did a really bad job at tending to us and making sure everything was okay. However, I assumed the time of the day played into effect about how we were being treated. The burgers were good and like any other Red Robin as expected from a chain restaurant so nothing really strikes out on this which gives the two stars in my rating.  I've visited other Red Robins, like the one in North Lake and there was such a drastic difference in atmosphere and service when compared to Fayetteville's. It's such a shame because I love this restaurant. Unfortunately, this is just going to be a restaurant I avoid, especially if it's a bad day for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
3,Andrew T.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,5,,5.0,2018-01-07,Amazing burgers! One time I messed up an order and they fixed it for me free of charge! They are the perfect place to eat before or after shopping at the mall!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
