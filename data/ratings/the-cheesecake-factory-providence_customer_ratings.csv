Overpriced. The food is mediocre. The decor is atrocious. It is incredibly loud.  And my biggest complaint--the unforgiveable-- THERE ARE ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE MENU (sorry to shout)  As if it's not annoying enough to pay those kind of prices for lame food, they are actually trying to sell you things right there as you decide on what to eat.  I found that so appalling that I actually wrote an email to the company.  They replied with:  ""Thank you for e-mailing us regarding your dining experience at our Providence Cheesecake Factory restaurant.

It was not our intention to offend you. I will certainly share your comments with our company executives."" The ads are not for area businesses, they are for handbags, cruises and the like.  And how does adding ads make something ""book-style""?  Books don't have ads, you morons, magazines do.

Everything was so good, came out at the correct staggered times, cooked properly, etc. Instead of cheesecake we both had a Georgia Peach cocktail, consisting of vodka, and frozen raspberry + peach puree swirled all around in a snifter with a huge piece of mint.

210,Eva B.,"New York, NY",10,38,,4.0,2012-06-26,"I've been to the cheesecake factory on multiple occasions over the years. I enjoy their huge selection and being a vegetarian, it's nice to go to a chain restaurant that has more than two vegetarian options on the menu. Their cheesecake is delicious, the only cheesecake that I will eat. They also have delicious pasta dishes like Garlic noodles and Evelyn's pasta which I usually get. Their raspberry lemonade is divine and their crispy artichoke hearts are the perfect appetizer. Just recently I went to the cheesecake factory with my boyfriend and I decided to try some new items off the menu. I got the farro salad which was absolutely delicious and unique with chewy farro, sweet beets, goat cheese feta, tomatoes, and crunchy english cucumbers. The salad was refreshing and as a small plate, just the right portion. In addition I also got the Sweet corn tamale cakes, which were also very unique. These mexican style corn cakes had a very yummy salsa verde, fresh pico, and creamy avocado pieces on top. However without the sauce the cakes tasted a tad bit too sweet and would have tasted better if they were cooked crispier and weren't so soggy. My boyfriend enjoyed his food for the most part, I believe he got the steak diane. On the downside however, our waitress was terrible. She put items down and ran away and was the slightest bit personable. I had to talk to two other male servers to get the lowdown on the tamales, assuring me that they were good. When I asked her she gave me a blank stare and seemed unsure in her answer to my question. she cleared our plates promptly, but didn't posses the best people skills. You usually cannot go wrong with the cheesecake factory, the only huge problem usually is the long wait.

My water was always full, and everything came in a timely manner. Now the food. I was torn between using the skinnylicious menu (yes, that is right, they have an entire menu of ""healthy"" options -- everything under 590 calories for an entree -- and all delicious) or the regular menu. I opted for the skinny version of the veggie burger (which is the same veggie burger on the regular menu, sans cheese). It was not your traditional gross microwaveable patty. It had farro, brown rice, beets, and some other ingredients -- and was absolutely delightful. And healthy.  After dinner we both ordered our cheesecake. Yes, they are a bit pricier, but I'm a dessert person and it is always fantastic, so I didn't mind spending more on something I really enjoy.

208,Ami G.,"Providence, RI",25,99,,4.0,2012-08-10,"Six weeks ago, I declared to my husband that when I finished my semi-torturous session of summer classes, we would go out to dinner (on a weekday night) to the one place we never go to since it is way too busy on weekends but that we both mutually love and adore- the Cheesecake Factory! See, here in Providence, there is only one Cheesecake Factory, and it is epically busy on weekends, to the point you usually have to wait an hour or two if you go around a normal dinner time. We typically get there at least twice a year, but this year, we haven't gone once yet! In fact, since I became vegan in December, the Cheesecake Factory has been off of our radar!   Well that all changed on Wednesday night.  We didn't get there until about 8:30, and there was still a fifteen minute wait.  I wasn't sure how much I would still be enamored by the Cheesecake Factory now that I avoid dairy and gluten, but after my experience there, it is safe to say the Cheesecake Factory remains at the top of my chain restaurant list!   They brought out their famed pumpernickel and sourdough bread and butter, both of which I passed on but did have a love affair with in my gluten-eating days!  We started with their made-to-order guacamole, and I asked that they leave out the sour cream in favor of double salsa.   The guac is outstanding! We ordered it spicy, and while it wasn't really, it did have a nice kick that reared itself periodically. It was uber-flavorful though- way better than any store-bought guac I have tried, and honestly, it was better than the guac I get at my favorite Providence Mexican restaurant!   Of course, no guac is complete without an endless supply of salty, crunchy tortilla chips!   For dinner, I ordered their ""Skinnylicious"" fresh vegetable salad. Now a word on this ""Skinnylicious"" business- I think the only difference between this and their regular fresh vegetable salad is the pomegranate dressing is low-fat in the Skinnylicious version. Honestly, I could have cared less if I got the Skinnylicious version or the regular one, but since the lower-fat option was available, I went with it.    I did make some changes to the original salad- I asked that they leave off the cheese and grilled chicken, and instead add some pecans and dried cranberries. Out waitress warned us there was an extra charge for that, which I thought was silly because I was essentially just making swaps, but whatever- I did it anyway!   The salad was. . . astoundingly gigantic, to say the least! It was an awesome mix of greens, edamame (yay for vegan protein in a chain restaurant salad!), apple, cucumber, tomato, green beans, beets, pecans and cranberries. Everything was chopped into perfect bite-sized bits, and the pom dressing covered every single component perfectly. I have to say, this salad was epic (been using that word a lot in this post!) and incredible and I am sad I was only able to eat about a sixth of it!   The reason I couldn't devote my full appetite to the salad was because my husband and I made an ordering oopsie. He got a burger, and asked that the fries be on a separate plate so I could have some. However, I had my eyes set on sweet potato fries, so of course, I ordered them too!  You figured out what our oopsie was right? Talk about over-ordering! My order of sweet potato fries was about double the size of the ones he got, which in and of themselves were quite plentiful in the fry department! In other words, we had fries up the ying-yang, and since they don't come home as leftovers as well as my salad would, I had to prioritize and keep my focus on fry consumption. Ok, when you have fries this crispy-on-the-outside and gooey on the inside, perhaps my dilemma wasn't entirely so bad! I ate a load of fries, and they were so tasty, but truth be told, there still was a load or two left!   I am upset with myself that my stomach shut down so quickly.  On a good day, I could have eaten so much more of those delectable sweet fries drowned in ketchup. Back in the dairy-eating days, I would always follow up my meal with a huge slice of either the peanut butter cup or Oreo cheesecake. I am actually glad (for my stomach) that I didn't even have that option last night, as I don't think following up that enormous meal with cheesecake is what I needed at all!   The Cheesecake Factory, in my opinion, is like the Bentley of chain restaurants. The food is always so consistently delicious- in all my times going there since it opened in Providence years ago, I have never had an experience with their food that was less than stellar.with their food that was less than stellar.

I'm not one for chain restaurants, and normally I wouldn't be caught dead spending my money here. But we had a gift certificate and gave it a shot. I've been in CCFs all across the country and their m.o. is always the same: we'll make you wait at least an hour for a table, feed you a ton of food and overcharge you for it, and you're gonna like it, beeyatches. And this CCF is ALWAYS mobbed. Ahem. In spite of this philosophy, today was pretty good. We went right at open and there was no wait. Our server Heather was friendly (if not overly chummy), very helpful, and delivered everything with the quickness. The kid food was kid food, but well presented. The rugrats thus satiated, I settled on a Firefly margarita (egads, sweet!

And the brown bread. Gotta love the brown bread.  The price tag was surprisingly cheap, as no single plate was more than $7... The margarita was the most expensive item.

Okay. I got the chicken quesadilla app. It's HALF a quesadilla, 4 slices. This is a perfect portion for an app to share with someone before a meal....for $6 not for the $12 it actually cost. And because everything is so overpriced, I decided to only have an app as my meal. However the price, it was a decent quesadilla. Not the best, but I enjoyed it.  The cheesecakes that I took home were $15. This I don't mind because I'm not about to make a banana cream cheese cake for fun at home. It was by far the best cheesecake I have ever had! Ugh I really loved it. I've also had the Oreo, which is good, but was just too rich for that whole piece.

Anyway, Cheesecake Factory  is a nice place to go in terms of how clean it is and the fixtures/furniture inside.  From a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being McDonalds and 10 being a place you need reservations 6 months in advance this is a solid 6.  The music is instrumental jazz playing on a loop.  The volume was too loud for me to have a conversation with the other person at my booth at a normal volume.   The service is good; the host and waitress were friendly and welcoming.  The real problem has to do with the prices for what you get.  I ordered a grilled fish dish for $18 and my date got a pasta dish for $17.  It looked like reheated Sysco made food to me.  It was not bad but in places I go in my hometown you get made from scratch food made to order for $12.  Portions are generous and there is a lot of variety and custom combinations for everything.   If the prices were lower and more in line with what you get for what you pay it would be better.  The mall could have more police/security out in plain view to prevent incidents before they start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=220,3.24,3.46,3.46,3.1440000000000006,3.3720000000000008

Our sever came along to let us know of a shift change and introduced us to our new server.  He offered more bread and a refill on our drinks which we declined.

Our new server came along again and said he just checked and found that the sandwich was ready but there seemed to be a problem with the chili. From my experience, chili, along with soup are items already prepared and just waiting to get bowled up. Along comes the manager who begins the conversation with ""your food will be out shortly"".  Not an apology, no offer to get us something while we continue to wait.  We commented that it had been 45 minutes since we ordered and he appears to get all defensive as if we just insulted him personally. He walks away and still 5 more minutes pass when the new server comes along again with no food.  We tell him we are not willing to wait any longer and to get our check.  He says he will be right back with it.  I couldn't believe he was actually going to bring us a check for club soda.

Recently my boyfriend ordered the pear & blue cheese flatbread, and it was one of the best things we have ever eaten. The combination of flavors was wonderful and all of the toppings were very fresh. The blue cheese crumbles were HUGE and had a bit of a nice smokey flavor. Our only complaint about it is that the serving was much too small. We also loved the zucchini, portobella and avocado fries. They were nice and crisp and not greasy or soggy at all. On the side it came with two dipping sauces that were very good.

Oreo Dream Extreme is also amazing, if you like oreos (profound, eh?).  Why the 3 stars? While service is usually good, once in a while there's a waiter with an attitude. Also, the savory food is really not that special. The only savory food I would order again is the blue cheese, pear, and walnut flatbread - a cliche yet scrumptious combination of sweet, salty, nutty flavors. The perfect appetizer to a dinner of cheesecakes (you need something savory to keep yourself sane). As long as you make cheesecake the main event, you'll have an enjoyable time. P.S.

As I'd hoped, it wasn't too busy. I limited myself to the one page lunch menu and chose a lunch-sized salad. This was an incredible salad. It was huge, dressed perfectly, and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I love salad but I don't usually order it in chain restaurants because they are too often overdressed or limp.

193,Amy G.,"Acushnet, MA",7,37,22.0,5.0,2015-01-18,Visited this location after a show at a local theater - and we were looking to have a quick bite so we could get back home to relieve the babysitter.  Unfortunately we had a 30min wait - but seeing the bakery area where they display all those Devine cheesecakes - we held on. First and foremost our waiter was fantastic - we let him know we were running short on time - and he worked his magic with getting bread and drinks on our table in a flash. I know that this sounds too good to be true - but we got our meals within 10 min of order - I was shocked!  I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps and I was more than pleased (ordered a light dinner as I knew that trying some of their legendary cheesecake was in my definite future). The chicken was grilled perfectly and coated in a delicious  sauce. The Bibb lettuce was crisp and held the ingredients well. The two sauces they offered were a great compliment to the dish. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and he actually commented that they cooked it the way he ordered it - amazing as he hasn't had that happen in a long time. Due to the rapid disappearance of his burger I noted he was enjoying it - one thing that really impressed me was the thick cut bacon they used (not that thin crappy kind you get at other places). The waiter was so attentive to our need to scoot outta there - he gave us our bill without prompting and delivered two ice teas in take out cups for our ride home. I could have hugged this guy he was so good. Now we had pre-planned that dessert was going to happen but we needed it packed - so when we got home (and our stomachs had settled) we got to enjoy the real star of the night. Godiva chocolate cheesecake and Tiramisu cheesecake - it was so rich you just can't finish the slice. They prepare the take home slices with the sauces and whip cream so they do not spare the details - which makes this dessert a must try!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=180,4.04,3.55,3.55,2.836,3.746

The bread they gave in the beginning was fresh and toasted perfectly on the outside. I ordered the pizza which is cut into 10 slices and reasonably priced and filling. The dough was soft with a bit of crunch to it and just really good. Finally trying the cheesecake was just out of this world! I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which includes a bottom chocolate crust layer with regular cheesecake and humongous globs of cookie dough with walnuts drizzled on top and in the cookie dough. I can't forget the whipped cream they put on the plate and on top of the cheesecake. Lastly the chocolate chips they sprinkled on each whipped cream circle. Why you may ask this is only four stars? If the food wasn't good then this would have been another one star for me. We waited 2 hours and 32 minutes to be seated. No reservations could be made on Sunday, so we took our chances and went in at 4:15 for a 5:00 dinner. They said an hour and a Half wait so we put our name down for the next available table and we went to the mall next door and looked around. Nearing the hour and a half mark we went back to the restaurant and was told another 20 minutes. Ok another 20 minutes we can live without it. There is one small booth to wait which was filled to The max with people. So we waited and waited, our feet getting tired of standing , our stomachs grumbling and then our buzzer vibrates. We arrived at that restaurant at 4:15 and was seated at almost 7:30 with the exaggeration of only 20 minutes left.

So that was good. We had two servers in the beginning but one of them went on break and forgot to tell the other one of my friend's order and she got her meal while we were eating dessert. At least our other good server continued to be wonderful and asked if she wanted any bread or food to tie her over until then. One server was amazing(wish I caught her name ) , the other terrible.

I will forever keep returning The Cheesecake Factory.  Sure, it's a little pricey for a chain, but the portions are incredibly huge. If you're super hungry, it's worth it, or you can take home leftovers. Win-win. I have a love affair with the Chicken Bellagio. I remember when it was a new special on the menu years ago and I'm so happy they made it a permanent menu item. I have a really hard time ordering something other than that when I'm there, but I'm getting better at venturing out. It's easy with such an insanely big menu. The nachos are amazing but more filling then you could ever imagine (even without chicken on them). My boyfriend and I made that mistake... ordered nachos for an appetizer and got entrees. Never again. Now if we're in the mood for nachos, we get another small appetizer to split. Usually the chicken sliders. They're amazing. My boyfriend was only disappointed in his meal once -- a Hawaiian pizza that was seriously undercooked and looked like it was frozen. He didn't eat it, we were comped, and it was okay. Now, he stays far away from the pizza. Luckily, there are a million other options for him to try.

While we have been here many times, the large selection on their menu always causes a long debate. However, this time I couldn't branch out I had to re-try the Orange Chicken. I had ordered this previously at a different location. it came out beautifully garnished and with a strong orange scent. Who would think, Chinese food at the cheesecake factory could be so delicious. The flavor was one of the boldest flavors I have experienced when ordering Orange Chicken. My only disappointment was the lack of sauce, I live for the extra sauce on the place and due to the beautiful garnishments and presentation there was no extra sauce to be had! This was such a light, refreshing chicken dish prepared with a light and crunchy coating.    Louisiana Chicken Pasta, this was an AMAZING dish. This was a  Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The New Orleans sauce was to die for!! Such a bold cream sauce, packed with flavor really made the dish. The chicken was perfectly coated and baked, but the best part was the sauce... I truly cannot rave enough about this sauce!

Pro: Nice decoration Professional and friendly wait staff Large portion Reasonable price as per portion and decor Fresh ingredients Delicious cheesecake Con: Cutting corners/steps in cooking The BBQ Pork Sandwich was noted in menu as using pulled pork.  The product contained chunks of pork, none pulled into stripes.  The flavour didn't infused inside the pork chunks.  This shortcoming would not have been noticeable should someone have pulled the pork into stripes.  Having said that, the burger was delicious (thumb up to the sauce) if this was a BBQ Pork Chunk Sandwich.  My suggestion is to either pull the pork as described in the menu description, or change the menu description into ""chunks of pork"".  I never expected fish tacos to be authentic in Rhode Island.  What I expected was something that looked like fish tacos and tasted good.  The fish tacos looked okay and came in double corn tortillas.  The white fish strips were chunky and fresh enough.  Unfortunately, the double corn tortillas were completely cold and half stiff.  This indicated that they were not kept warm and moist, or at least not re-hydrated and warmed up before use.  The best way I can describe how unenjoyable these tacos were is to imagine someone serves a hamburger in cold and half hardened buns.   The accompanied bean and rice were not refried beans and Mexican rice, yet both tasted alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=40,3.28,3.47,3.47,3.0200000000000005,3.394

It was a party of family members travelling as far as New Hamshire for my birthday. It was 11:45 am when I arrived for my 12:00 reservation, traffic was horrible due to April construction and there was practically no parking. The restaurant was empty. I went and told the host that I arrived for my reservation, she said, ""Actually they already checked in but we can't seat you until everyone is here."" I turn around and see six of my party over in the waiting area. So half of my party is already here (since my boyfriend and I arriving makes eight people) and they won't even seat us? I sat down with them and my seven year old brother and one year old sister are getting restless since there is nothing for them to do and we wait for the rest of the party to get here. My grandparents call me and say they are parked but can't find the restaurant because it's a hike from the garage, and while I'm on the phone with them the hostess comes back over and says that she can only hold the table until 12:05. So I turn to her and say, ""You are going to turn away a reservation for a party of 15 for not being here within five minutes of the reservation? In what universe does 15 people arrive at a place within five minutes of each other?"". She explains it's ""house policy."" In every restaurant we've been to, reservations are held for a courtesy of 15 minutes. My boyfriend gets off the phone with the remainder of our party, which traveled in together, and said they were walking over as we speak, and the hosts are already dismantling the table (it's 12:01!).

I'm a cheesecake fanatic, but the advice was sound, ""You're in a new city, sample the local flavor."" I agreed that line of thinking made sense and it had occurred to me, but I still planned to have some cheesecake since the Cheesecake Factory was just a block away.  The local fair I decided to try was a let down, and only the beer I had was worth it. So I didn't eat and beat my feet back up the hill.  Because I wanted to room for my cheesecake and this place always gives a hefty piece, I opted for 2 appetizers rather than a meal. I decided on the: *Chicken Samosas - Crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken. Served with cilantro dipping sauce. $5.95 *Crispy Crab Bites - Bite sized little crab cakes served with mustard sauce.  While the samosas were good, I didn't entirely enjoy the pairing with the cilantro sauce, though it wasn't bad. The crab bites and mustard bites were nearly divine and at 6 for an appetizer, that's more than enough.  For the reason I go to the Cheesecake Factory I tried a new cake flavor that I've never had. Which was: *Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - Banana cream cheesecake topped with Bavarian Cream and fresh sliced bananas (I got my bananas on the side.)

My girlfriend received a gift card for the Cheesecake factory so we decided to have to appetizers and drinks before going to the movies at the Providence Place Mall.  The restaurant already had a line forming at 4:30 so we sat at a high top at the bar.  Our server seemed completely disinterested in us, and I was disappointed there were only 3 draft beers available, sam adams, sam adams winter, and blue moon.  So I ordered a tall blue moon and my gf got a strawberry basil margarita.  Little did I realize, upon checking some of the reviews on here, that there was a happy hour from 4-6pm, as our server never informed us, nor gave the special happy hour menu.  Whether or not this was to get us to buy items not off that menu (which are 15-30% cheaper) I don't know, but when I asked her for a happy happy hour menu she seemed confused.  Long story short, we ordered (from the happy hour specials), the beet and goat cheese salad, buffalo chicken pot-stickers, tuna tartare, and pretzel crusted chicken. My beer was flat, my girlfriend's drink sugary and lacking almost any alcohol, for 10 bucks a pop on those drinks you expect something half decent. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out to us, which I understand it's busy but these were all appetizers that didn't require much attention.  All I took away from this was a mild stomach ache.

For those that don't like too many choices this may be overwhelming but I personally love it.  So in breakdown by dishes:  Skinnylicious Tuscan Chicken: The dish was gigantic so if you're going hungry and considering this it will not do you wrong. The sauce soaked in the tomatoes and the farro was mouthwatering. I absolutely devoured the tomatoes. However, the chicken itself was not cooked that well and was very hard to break it off. It also didn't really have a taste which was surprising because you would have hoped that the sauce soaked into it. I think there are better things on the menu.  GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE:So the group I was with for the most part we were all trying to be healthy but this was something we could not resist. The nuts are a perfect compliment to the smoothness that is cheesecake and every bite only left you wanting more. I love white chocolate so perhaps I may be biased but 4/4 of us said we would order it again.  Key Lime Cheesecake: THis didn't hit the home run quite so much. It definitely was strong in the key lime flavor so don't expect anything else. But I personally dont enjoy cheesecakes that are fruity based because I am looking for chocolate.

We arrived at the restaurant around 730pm on a Saturday and were told that the wait would be approximately an hour for the four of us. We were find with the wait (its Saturday night, there is going to be a wait wherever we go) and were handed a pager.  Around 845, we still had not been paged/called. I went up to the host and asked how much longer our wait would be, seeing as how they told us an hour at 730. He said that we were next on the list and it shouldnt be any longer than 10 minutes for a table. At 9, I went up again to the host. Said it had been 15 minutes, and asked if we had been forgotten as people who were waiting that arrived after us were being seated. He said we werent on the list, and insisted that he had paged us 10 minutes ago. I had the pager in my hands. It had never gone off.... He said ""Im paging it right now."" as I held that pager that was not going off right in front of him. So, CLEARLY your pagers are not working properly and your ignorant host(s) have no clue what they are doing... Fast forward to when we order, my husband and I ordered salmon and pasta, both of which came out together... My SIL and BIL food was no where to be found. TEN minutes later, the waitress walks by and notices that they dont have their burgers. She comes back with the burgers and tells us the places are EXTREMELY hot... which in the restaurant world means ""Sorry, your shit has been sitting under the heat lamps for a long ass time so if it tastes awful, my bad."". My BIL and SIL didnt touch their burgers, they were completely inedible. They looked disgusting. The waitress took both burgers off the bill... By this time it was close to 11pm...

This review however is specifically for our server Anthony S.  He was very fun. He didn't have to read specials off a little notepad but he remembered it and all while not sounding like a robot (I hate that) he was for the most part being himself which is awesome. He was extremely patient with my four year old Delilah who had a lot of questions that Anthony had no problem answering. He made her smile the whole time. When the food came out he was concerned about delilahs plate being hot so he brought out a side plate and even helped her cut it so that it could cool off.  I am in the industry and have been for 11 years Anthony actually taught me something last night and I thought I knew it all. What a great server. If he's not the head server you should most definitely make him one and he would also make an excellent manager. I will deff be back and ask for Anthony.

I don't know about all of you, but my girlfriend and I sure love cheesecake, but honestly that is probably the only thing that is actually really good at this restaurant.  I normally order the burrito grande and allows enjoy it and the food seems to be just above average for the rest of the menu from what I here from friends and those whom we eat out with.  Honestly I believe some of the meals are overpriced and the service as been diminishing since this place became so well known.  My girlfriend and I went here this past Friday with two friends of ours and left not as satisfied as we expected.  I ordered the burrito, like I said, and she ordered the eggplant parm.  My meal was very good and filling and was at a cost of around $15.  Her meal was similar in price; however, the eggplant was very dry, the pasta was plain, and there wasn't much sauce that came on it at all.  Overall she was not satisfied with the meal she had gotten.  My friends ordered two pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy them enough; however, weren't ecstatic about their meals either.  We started off the meal with the traditional bread which is allows some that that is great to hold you over before a meal.  We also ordered the nachos and my two friends bought two beers to start as well.  The nachos were pretty good; however, it took an extremely long time to get them and that something that simply shouldn't occur with an appetizer.  My friends beers were at a cost of $9 which is a little pricey especially for the common beers that they chose. The beers took over 15 minutes to get to the table and that is another thing we were disappointed in.  The server seemed like a robot not really caring about what we wanted, but more so focusing on giving some what of an automated and typical  introduction of the menu.  She was polite; however, very slow.  We all ordered cheesecakes to go and three of us had meals to take home.  The server took each plate and wrapped them for us, but when she gave them back to us she handed them to us individually and when we all got home we realized she had given two of us the wrong meals.  We had already parted ways at this point so we weren't able to switch them back.  The cheesecake was very good as it always is.  I had the red velvet cheesecake and Tori had the Oreo cheesecake and they were both very good.  Honestly this place has changed since it began and not in a good way.  Overall the food was subpar for what you pay for, but the cheesecake was still good.  I'm not sure if I will come back again due to the bad service and average food, but I may be back just for the cheesecake because that is the one category they never disappoint me with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=80,3.2,3.36,3.36,2.184,3.2960000000000007

Our waiter was a cool guy and did well serving us. The drinks were well presented and of decent size. I asked for my mojito to not be too sweet. It was too sweet and progressively sweeter with each order as if my server or bartender forgot the detail.. Each mojito was $12.95.. which is a totally incorrect price for a chain restaurant. $10 would have been more appropriate. Their meals in general were, in my opinion, a few dollars more than they were worth in many instances too.  I ordered Baja Chicken Tacos. The tortillas were [for some reason] double layered and mushy to the point of falling apart. The rice you could probably chip a tooth on.  I only ate the inside of the tacos and small side order of beans. Most of the others at our table ordered burgers which were decent. I tried someone's fries when they came out and they were room temperature. One girl did not even eat 1/5 of her burger and our server did not ask if she liked her meal (she did not).

I didn't know what to get so I go with something I've gotten many times before....the orange chicken. In the past the chicken has definitely been a slightly better quality and the vegetables were way too salty this time around. Too much soy sauce. My boyfriend got the Catfish. I tried a bite and it literally tasted like pure dirt/mud. We Google immediately what the flavor is supposed to be and come to find that the dirt flavor stems from not being washed/soaked properly. YUCK!!! He asks to take it back and get something else. This time the chicken and biscuits. It was good except when I took a bite, got a little crunchy sensation.  Previously I had asked for a ginger ale which I don't know why took so long. So she finally brings out a small bottle of Canada dry that has already been opened?!?!?!?! Wtf.

The food to me, in general was ok.  The apps which consisted of calamari, nachos and stuffed mushrooms were all good.  No complaints there.  The entree I got was the spicy chipotle chicken on penne.  It wasn't bad, but it had some sweetness to it that didn't seem to fit.  Others that I ate with that had been there before commented on how the food tasted rushed as it was much better when they had been there previously.  The overall consensus was disappointment. For dessert I got the banana cream cheesecake and tried the Godiva and tuxedo slices as well.  All ranged from good to ok, but not good enough to makeup for the wait or the main course.  The apps and our server were the only saving graces from going with a lower rating though a 2 1/2 would be more accurate.

You wait at the top of the stairs for them to call your name. Not a great system if you ask me....Then the wait service was slow and the food took forever to come out. The food was just average and I found it to be a bit overly salted. I think the cheesecake was the best part of the meal. The place was so noisy and crowded and clearly could not handle the large crowds of people. People were also fighting in the bathroom for stalls that actually had toilet paper as most of them did not. Was not a good experience here I get it was on a busy night and such but no customer should have to fight so hard to have dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=140,2.56,3.01,3.304,2.44,2.8299999999999996

153,Tea L.,"North Providence, RI",0,8,,2.0,2017-03-09,"Definitely had one of the most bad dining experiences here. First, let's talk about how they do not take reservations on weekends ( their busiest times) I personally do not understand this logic. Because as soon as you walk into this restaurant it's like trying to enter a club..it's literally shoulder to shoulder ridiculous. The wait was 45 mins (ended up waiting over an hour). That's fine, it's expected on Saturday night. But ..but.. how do you not take reservations, knowing how busy this restaurant gets and have a waiting area big enough to seat two ppl! So it literally is comparable to chaos in there. For such a huge restaurant they definitely could do better with the seating issue. Now when me and my friends finally were seated. We waited about 10 mins just for our waiter to get to us (with no water) then waited an additional 15 mins for our drinks. Still, with NO water. The waiter did not bring us anything the whole time we were sitting at the table like idiots with bread with nothing to drink!! Our waiter was ALL over the place could not focused and we could barely get his full attention for more than 60 seconds. The only reason I'm rating this place 2 stars is because the food no doubt was DELICIOUS. I mean after waiting 35 mins for it it's better be right? Anyways, after finishing our food and asking for our check. We waited 15 mins before our waiter shouting about how his house was on fire and had to leave immediately. So he left and we sat at table again like idiots waiting for our check with no one waiting on us... finally we caught the attention of another frazzled waitress and got the hell out of there.

Saturday night, around 6pm, we are given an hour wait time. No big deal. We expected that so we killed an hour outside talking. When we finally get to our table, the girl waiting on us was very sweet. She was filling in for our server, Grace, who was on break. We ordered waters and then about 15 minutes later, our meals. He went with a bacon bacon burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered Parmesan herd crusted chicken with red skin garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Our food took a normal amount of time for a busy Saturday night. Our food was exactly how we ordered it. I only ate one of the 3 pieces of chicken and a few bites of the mashed and also green beans. It was amazing but I just couldn't even dent it. Our server Grace was back at this time. She took my food to wrap it up and we ordered a huge piece of chocolate cake to split. It was delicious.  She brought my food back and also our bill. It was only about $50 for the both of us and he put his card in with the check. Our server ran the wrong check with his card despite giving us the proper check in the first place. She charged his card $130 for the table across from us. This wasn't a huge deal. Just a pain and a stupid mistake.  We fixed that and left. Later that evening when I got hope, I opened up my left overs thinking I'd have some more chicken but nope! The girl sent me home with the wrong left overs. So gross. Someone's half chewed asparagus was in the place of delicious meal. This was such a let down. I had 75% of my meal left.

I've gotten the salad previously at another Cheesecake Factory location and really enjoyed it, but this time not so much. The beets tasted like they had been fermented in a salt brine. The last time I ordered this, they did not taste that way. The salty flavor did not complement this sweet salad at all, and it was just plain funky.

It wouldn't be as packed as the one in Providence only b/c there were other restaurants around the vicinity. I also noticed that the price of the Well-Mannered Dirty Martini in Braintree is $11 and the one in Providence is $9! Score!... Since I moved back to Providence and it is my favorite 'tini! I always call ahead to see how long the wait is. It is the only one in Providence so you have to expect a long wait time, especially on the weekends. I love the fact that they're open late to 12:30AM on weekends! You have to imagine how the hosts & workers feel with hungry, hangry, rude customers complaining about waiting 10-20 minutes. They must be stressed out with all those customers hovering over the hostess stands. Give them a break! I LOVE their food. I've had almost everything on the menu, no Lie. My favorite though, is Steak Diane (med rare), stuffed mushrooms ( that I cannot find the recipe for), fried zucchini, shrimp scampi, bistro shrimp pasta, tuna tataki salad....Oh man, the list goes on!

Right in the downtown occupying prime real estate. What a waste of my time for choosing the worst customer service ever. This incident happened last night 06/23/2017. It started with me and my friends waiting for 5 mins to 10 minutes to be noticed by a receptionist . There was no one at the reservation table. After asking a guy who was adjusting the menu, he helped us out and got us seated in 10 mins which was a pretty quick service.  There comes our waiter- tries his best to show off with his specials menu and then asks for a drink. Once the drinks are placed he hurries us for the order, at that point my friends and I order appetizers and were in no mood for entree. The guy gives this nasty look which my friend feels offended . I brushed it off saying he  probably didn't mean anything. Once we were in the middle of our appetizers he comes back and asks for anything else. At that point I ask him for dessert recommendations. He points at the menu on the table next to me and says give me the menu. I was taken back and offended by way he asked (rude and demanding) and when I asked him dessert recommendations again, he repeats three times to give him the menu on the table . There was no please or may I have the menu please?. At that point I was furious after handing him the menu and he turns to the picture on the menu and says I wanted to show this. This is all in his condescending, arrogant attitude. I wasn't sure what his problem was, I am not sure if it was because we were brown skin ( this is the first time ever I had encountered this kind of incident ever) . I didn't want to confront him for his behavior , I politely asked him to call his manager. By the way the waiter name is Anthony.  Manager showed up and said he was sorry on behalf of the waiter . I asked for a different waiter/waitress which he did. (the new waitress was courteous and professional and even apologized at the end for his colleagues behavior) .I asked the manager if there is going to be any follow up about what action he will be taking, he didn't have an answer. I insisted I would like to know and I will be posting a review on yelp for response. Manager told me I could post one but he can't answer to it .  I am not sure what policies does cheese cake factory has to deal with this kind of behavior by one of their staff members. The manager did try his part to be professional, but had no information for further response.

53,David E.,"BUZZARDS BAY, MA",1,93,,4.0,2017-06-30,"Ate here today with my mom and aunt. My mother got crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms. and my aunt ordered flatbread pizza and a side salad. I picked two items. First, I got something new from the ""small plate"" options, Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (if you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, it's fried chicken brushed with a spicy paste that includes smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, then served with dill pickle slices and white bread). For my entree, I picked a filet mignon grilled well done, with mashed potatoes. To drink, we all just had ice water. My mother and aunt only said they really enjoyed their food, not saying too much more about it. I really liked the Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (any time I can get boneless chicken is a plus) they were a different take on spicy chicken than buffalo wings, and pickles were a nice touch. Unlike hot chicken served in Nashville, this did not come with any bread, just pickles and a side of ranch for dipping. My filet was cooked just as I wanted it, juicy and flavorful, with no pink in the middle. I know that Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where the prices are on the expensive side, but I didn't even see how much the bill came to, because my aunt snatched it up right away, and announced she was paying for lunch, and didn't want any arguments. No problem here. Our waitress was friendly and attentive (frequently coming by to see if our water glasses needed refilling, and doing so without us having to ask her). Our food did take quite a while to come out from the kitchen, but we attributed that to the crowded dining room. I'll be back soon.

The asparagus was cold. Chicken was okay but nothing to write home about. I asked for extra lemon sauce for the chicken and I got it, thankfully because they never put enough on. Ok, so portion size is very large. It's enough for three meals. Restaurants should start offering half portion sizes with 25% to 30% discount.

Otherwise the place is overpriced for subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.76,2.8,3.168,,2.784
2,Robert S.,"San Antonio, TX",4,29,6.0,1.0,2017-11-24,"Warning: do not visit here. If you do, it's buyer beware. Long wait times and questionable food safety.  Waited 90 minutes for seating after being told 45 minutes was the wait by the hostess. Warning, there is very limited indoor / outdoor seating.  Waited 10 minutes after seating for our drinks.  Waited another 70 minutes for food to arrive.  Yes, we made a poor decision waiting that long.  Then the worst started.  One meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had several hairs in it.  Another meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had pieces of plastic the size of a fingernail. Waitress stated that ""sometimes the kitchen just rips off the plastic on the frozen chicken and accidentally cook plastic into the food"".  After getting the bill, the waitress accidentally stepped on one of the children's feet (2 year old that just learned to walk). To be fair, little one was standing close by her side next to the table.  We had our meals comped. The Cheesecake Factory here is really far below standards. Our regular Cheesecake Factory in Texas never treats us that way in all our years of visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.68,2.77,3.152,,2.734
38,Tingxin W.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-17,"DON'T COME--BAD SERVICE. Last night I had dinner with my friends at the first floor. After we paid, the waitress did not give back our cards. We found out this morning and we had to take uber to the restaurant  to take them. The lady with glasses at the counter helped us take our cards back, without saying anything. So I explained the situation again to her, to indicate how their people caused our inconvenience. After hearing what I said, the lady simply relied ""ok, I give your cards back."" SHE DID NOT EVEN SAY A SORRY. She acted like it was my own fault. I once liked their cheesecake so much but I THIS IS MY LAST TIME HERE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=20,2.52,2.76,3.144,,2.664
5,Maryam A.,"Providence, RI",43,38,63.0,4.0,2017-12-27,"SHOUTOUT TO OUR SERVER BRYAN R! I've been to TCF more times than I can count, but last night's service prompted me to want to write a review. Our server was absolutely amazing. He was attentive, refilled our drinks numerous times and checked in on us every time he walked by. Usually the service here is okay and sometimes subpar, but last night we were very pleasantly surprised. Reason for the four stars is really their lack of appetizer options available last night. Also, the food is good, but not five stars good. We shared a fried cheese appetizer, since the stuffed mushrooms and  avocado egg-rolls we wanted were not available anymore for the night. It was good, nothing really memorable. I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta and it was delicious. My friend had the four cheese pasta and the sauce for that dish was very tasty too. All in all a good place for lots of comfort food. Thanks again Bryan R for the great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.64,2.78,3.144,,2.724
1,Anthony C.,"North Providence, RI",49,3,13.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"From the start.   No call ahead seating we waited in a cold area for 45 min The buzzer they wanted us to hold smelled like a dead animal.  It probably was not disinfect in weeks. We sat down in the middle of the restaurant and it is about 60 degrees.   I asked for heat and it just got colder the excuse is it is because the doors keep opening.  I would expect this from a small local tavern not at a million $ chain. Ordered food and they are out of 2 things I want.  I am here with a gift certificate.  We had to ask for water and a piece of bread for our meal.  So far I blame management not our server she is pleasant.   We ordered non alcoholic beverages.   15 min and the bread finally comes out no bread dish.   Our children are now waiting for food ours is here and getting cold.  I never eat without my children getting their food it is just plain rude. Food came out for all and it tastes great.  Portion is good.  We just went from a 1star to a 2 star because we are rating the entire restaurant experience, Not just the food.   Deserts are good but my Linda's Chocolate cake is frozen $9 per slice for a cake made in a warehouse not their kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.64,2.76,3.144,,2.712
35,Cheryl T.,"Attleboro, MA",12,2,,2.0,2017-12-28,"9 of us went there last night for my granddaughter's 16th birthday. We were seated fairly quickly, but it all went down from there. Service was very slow. We ordered our meals and waited quite a while before we got our meals. My father never got his. When The manager came over and apologized for not getting his chicken salad sandwich we told him it was chicken Parm. He said he would personally take care of it. Half hour later no sandwich.  Both were very apologetic waitress and manager but no sandwich. He finally got it boxed up when we were ready to Leave. When he got home and saw it it was so burnt he could not eat it. My meal was called but if I said something I knew I would not get fed that night so I ate it. My husband wrapped up his large portion of fish and chips and when he get home the only thing in the bag was the coleslaw. He asked for the coleslaw separate but not completely without the meal! Tried calling restaurant twice since then And ask for a manager but manager never comes to phone. Still the company was wonderful and we enjoyed it but do not think we will go back there again. The manager did take that the sandwich off the bill and along with a couple of other desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=20,2.6,2.74,3.132,,2.684

Food was ok, drinks ok, and usually the wait staff is ok, but this time it was exceptional! We had Katie M as our server and she was amazing! Very attentive, very spritely, and overall made us very happy. We had a server before that and she changed out with Katie M and we are thankful for that as she was a lot more attentive and happy serving us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.64,2.73,3.124,,2.694

That being said, the experience is made much better by some pleasant and very attendant staff. The wait to get a table can be long since it is attached to the mall and within walking distance of many of the downtown attractions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.6,2.75,3.116,,2.6900000000000004
3,JonSteph R.,"Attleboro, MA",14,12,,5.0,2018-01-11,I'm not big on chain restaurants but I make the exception for this place. FYI read a menu before going they have so many choices its like reading a book and will save you time choosing. I love the food but I usually get the same meal every time. The chicken marsala over pasta. I have not tried one better anywhere else yet. And no cheesecake will compare to theirs. Why you ask? I'm not even a fan of cheesecake. But theirs taste so good! And if you are full after your meal just take one to go. That is after you finally decide which kind you want.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence,2.64,2.75,3.12,,2.7060000000000004
