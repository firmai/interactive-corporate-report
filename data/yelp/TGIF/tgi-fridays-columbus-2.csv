Caerleigh T.,"Grove City, OH",6,53,,1.0,9/9/2010,"Fridays suckered us in with a coupon for a free appetizer.  We will know better next time! First off, no complaints with service or front of the house folks.  They were all very pleasant and nice. But the food...oh, the food.  Appetizers we ordered potato skins and mozz sticks.  The mozz sticks were nice, but the potato skins had the smallest, measliest amount of cheese on them.  But, no biggie...if the main course was good, that could have been ignored. The main course...was NOT good. Hubby had the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  Chicken was dry, it wasn't seasoned or flavored very well.  I had the Grilled Shrimp Scampi and Salmon with a side of broccoli.  The shrimp was decent, but the kitchen KILLED the salmon, completely overcooked, and the broccoli was yellow and sad and incredibly salty.  I also had sweet potato fries...unremarkable, but at least not bad like the rest of the dish. To top it off, the bill was like $42.  I would expect MUCH better for $42.  Will never return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40
Courtney W.,"Daytona Beach, FL",50,337,195,2.0,2/15/2013,"First time sitting in the dining room at this location. I didn't like it. The set up was nice and it all looked like a Fridays, but the wait staff threw me off. Back home, Fridays is known for their drinks but the prices in NJ are higher then they are in Columbus. I wasn't expecting them to have the same prices. Expect your drinks to cost $10 each. A cheap drink here is around $8 or $9.  The food at this location isn't what I remember. The chicken wings, something I used to get all the time in college, were dry and bland; only thing I tasted was ""hot"". The potstickers were pretty bad too. It's such a shame, like I said, I used to love Fridays but this location has me wishing I was back home. Seems this place just cant cook. I got the fried shrimp which gives you a lot of food for the money. The shrimp had this weird off flavor to it, similar to when the shrimp aren't cleaned first which was surprising since I thought these were frozen and just baked. I don't have a lot fo expectations for Fridays so I tend to judge them higher automatically since this was my hang out in College. But this location just isn't worth going to, esp since the prices are so much higher then what I'm used to seeing out here.  Past experiences here would leave me never ordering anything aside from app's, cocktails, and burgers. With prices high on drinks and the apps being bland, and a recent change in only serving well done burgers I cant see myself coming back here.  I think the only reason I gave them such a high review last time was I came with a buzz already. I don't tend to see price signs when Ive been drinking lol. they do have a really cool bar though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40
Paul F.,"Columbus, OH",175,927,2263,3.0,8/14/2009,I took a friend of mine to dinner this afternoon and he got to choose where we were going to go.  He really liked his sirloin but my ribs were seriously devoid of meat.  The service was good though but I'm never going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40
Jeff A.,"Chicago, IL",1166,309,7,3.0,8/7/2009,"Meagan was a great waitress, my group ate here twice, after having a wonderful dining experience we went back and requested her a second time!  I have never been the biggest fan of Friday's but they have good food and an easy atmosphere... The first time was the day I flew in I was tired and my coworkers were in a rush and knew exactly what they wanted, so I opened the menu saw the long platter of Jack Daniel's sliders and went for it...  These were the thickest sliders I have ever had, i did not need to eat all 4 but I did...LOL I can be a pig...  The flavor was on point and I can't imagine many people finding disappointment in these beefy treats... The second time I did a Jack Daniel's combo with sirloin and chicken, the meat was all flavorful and the veggies were perfect, the only thing I would change for next time is the mash potatoes the consistency was questionable, next time I will substitute in sweet potato fries or onion rings for sure! Meagan was great she kept the drinks full and was ready for any request and some of my coworkers can be high maintenance to say the least! Friday's you are better then I remember!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40
Brian W.,"Oakland, CA",27,281,42,4.0,1/7/2012,"This is a classic TGIF store.  We get lots of offers via email and FB, so we rarely go in a pay full price.  With this advantage, TGIF is actually a great value, often about the same as a fast food burger place.  There's definitely a formula to this place and little originality, but the basics are there and well done.  Go, but take a coupon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=40

Steve M.,"Orlando, FL",10,176,73,3.0,9/9/2011,Been quite a spell since I've been to this place and I was happy to return. We sat in the bar area and were served early and often. I had the parmesan chicken and my wife had the captain Morgan chicken sandwich . Both were excellent choices the flavors and textures were spot on. They lost a little when they took our refill order then forgot about it. But it only resulted in a delay of about 10 minutes.

Chang L.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,2.0,3/26/2016,"The only reason for me to give a 2 star instead of 1 is because of their service. The Waitress who served us was nice, call me babe a lot but it's fine with me.  Okay, their food. Are terrible. We ordered two burgers. All came out BURNT like on fire burnt. The buns are dry. Ribs we ordered was crispy, I've never got crispy ribs before I don't know about anybody else.

My Boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had an amazing bartender (William) and two other ladies, I am not aware of their names though, but they were fantastic! The food was wonderful and the drinks were perfect! $3.00 Long Islands on Thursdays as well!

Loraine A.,"Columbus, OH",16,26,23,4.0,7/27/2015,Sat by the bar to eat; the staff were very attentive. The food took a bit long to receive but I later learned they were short staffed in the kitchen.

Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,3.0,6/15/2012,"It is what it is...a Fridays!  The food can be a crap shoot sometimes, meaning sometimes it is sooooo good and then other times it can be a greasy mess.  But if you like their offerings then you won't go too wrong here.  Service has always been good and sometimes interesting like when I got into a sci-fi movie discussion with the server. I really liked that they had $4 glasses of certain wines the day I went and I'm a sucker for their fried green beans.  Fried green beans? Rather defeats the purpose of a healthy low calorie veggie, huh? It happens!  If Friday's food is your thing then go forth and enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=20
Heath D.,"Columbus, OH",97,172,130,4.0,8/5/2015,"Nice location. The wait was a little crazy when we went but I suppose it could've been worse. Several tables opened up and searing had not begun, so that was a little weird. It was dinner time so I'm sure they didn't have staff go home. In fact, when we asked, they said they would accommodate and seated us within minutes of one of those empty tables. Rather weird. Food was great though. Service was good too. Though there was a server working the bar that was...very odd. He was attentive, bust just strange. Not to be mean about it, but if we knew we were getting his table again, we would wait. The guy was THAT weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=20
Donny S.,"Columbus, OH",74,17,1,3.0,8/6/2015,"Waiter was very friendly, however he brought B&B plates with ketchup all over them for us to eat our appetizer platter off of. Salads arrived before he returned with clean B&B's and entrees were brought before we were halfway done with salads. They kept asking to clear plates that we were still obviously working off of. It just seemed like we were being rushed. Both steaks came out well done; my wife ordered medium and I ordered mid rare.. the waiter dropped the check off before our re-fire even made it back to the table without offering desert. My first visit to this location was great which is why I'm granting 3 stars.. but this visit has lost my business completely.

Em G.,"Columbus, OH",44,7,,3.0,9/18/2015,My experience here last night was good! Bartender was friendly and food was satisfying. Some things I wish were different though was the bartender took a while to check back in with us after ordering drinks to order food. there were a lot of menus and it wasn't super clear what their specials were. I ordered the chicken and shrimp which is super delicious but I probably wouldn't get it again because the tails were still attached to the shrimp and the chicken and shrimp was served with an abundance of mashed potatoes and cheese with just a little bit of vegetables. I still like this place though and would go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=20

Another person brought us our app, no big deal, however we never received any napkins or silverware.  The whole time we were there, two other bartenders or servers came to the computer directly in front of us, and they never asked if we needed anything. Our bartender finally comes up to us when we are completely out of beer and our food is done, after about 10 minutes being done. At this point we just want to leave and he says ""I'd hate to see you go"".

Nick C.,"Columbus, OH",6,9,6,2.0,6/3/2011,"As has been the case recently, I had to succumb myself to the glutenous Polaris shopping area north of Columbus to take advantage of it's close proximity to Costco, World Market, Target, etc. Providing my family with some basic, affordable essentials due to a recent relocation has been a must. Speaking of basic essentials, our afternoon culinary pursuits have included eating at some of America's most generic ""not quite fast food"" chain restaurants. Why did we choose TGIFridays? Basically, the decision boiled down to realizing that my wife had a $25 gift card in her purse and it had to be used. We were also curious to see if we could get her, my 2 year old daughter, and I fed at or below the $25 mark.  The last time I ate at a TGIFridays was around 1999. The memorabilia and flare that famously hangs from every wall and ceiling in establishment evokes me to feel like I just ate there last week. Not much has changed over the years, except for the loud music selection which was all about Avril Lavigne. My wife ordered some sort of endless portion soup and salad lunch deal. The Caesar salad that she ripped through was highly concentrated in a dressing that appeared to be pure mayo. I took a bite... it really may have been pure mayo. I also could have drank her broccoli and cheese soup like a glass of milk. Talk about a combo that could be dangerous... mayo and cheesy soup. Luckily, she fared just fine. My daughter got a hamburger (or as she likes say, a ""Hanga-burger"") with some fruit on the side, and a special scoop of vanilla ice cream to help celebrate her second Memorial Day on this Earth. As was the case in my review of O'Charleys, which is across the street from TGIFridays, she seemed to enjoy the food. This is really the only reason why I rated my experience 2 stars instead of 1... she was entertained and actually wasn't picky throughout the meal. It must be a butter/sugar/salt thing that inundates the menu. It's probably a way to get the customer hooked at a young age. I recall from over a decade ago that TGIFridays actually has decent French Onion Soup, so I ordered a bowl and half of a club sandwich. The soup really is decent, but it made me extremely thirsty. I think I had 3 refills of iced tea. In the end, our bill came to tally just over $23, so we achieved our goal not to spend a single cent of our own money (unless you're counting tip). The next time I go to a TGIFridays, I may find myself in a spot like Polaris again shopping at Costco, World Market, and Target for the basic essentials that my daughter will need as she goes off to college.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2?start=20

Kimberly S.,"Marengo, OH",9,48,13,2.0,3/6/2013,"Kind of disappointed with this place. I've always loved their food, but.... In order to get the happy hour specials you have to be seated at the bar? Why? We had out 16 month old son with us, & they don't make booster seats high enough to accommodate the pub height tables that are in the bar. - 1 star. Then service was just blah. Could've been better. The server made sure to tell us non of our drinks came with free refills, even my sons' apple juice. Really? We're paying close to $100 when this is all said & done & we can't get a refill on an infants apple juice? That's just irritating. Also the place was empty, but they sat us at some funky round table.

Laura R.,"Bloomington, IN",11,46,148,3.0,9/6/2016,"My husband and I went here yesterday as we were traveling back from our Labor Day weekend trip. We stopped in for lunch around noon and were greeted by the most monotonous hostess. (Seriously, the least enthusiastic person I've ever seen at a restaurant.) We were greeted quickly by our waiter and were able to have our order taken within 5 minutes. Our waiter was a little socially awkward, but I appreciated that he was very attentive to us. I got the Truffle burger, after figuring they didn't have a lunch menu since it was a holiday, and it was just all right. The burger was a little burnt and wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.  As I decided not to ask about the lunch menu since it was a holiday and I figured they would have given one to us if they were actually serving lunch portions, I was frustrated to see a patron ordering something off of a lunch menu when we were leaving. (Entrees for $6-7 rather than the $12-15 menu we ordered from.) My husband and I paid nearly $35, including tip, for the two of us just for lunch.

So -- when it comes to rating the service, my comments are based on my lunch time experiences.  This is actually one of our favorite lunch time haunts.  My wife and I come here at least once or twice a month for lunch and the service has always been exceptional.  With the exception of one over-zealous (translate that as ""over-bearing / over- attentive""), the lunchtime staff have all been exceptionally good - prompt, courteous and professional.  And -- after asking the over-zealous waiter to ""back-off"" a little, he complied. For some reason, I had never associated TGIF's with burgers but but what brings us in and keeps bringing us back for lunch are their burgers.  I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu but my wife and I are both hooked on the burgers.  Between us, we've tried most of the varieties on the menu and all have been very good.   This is a good place to get ""in and out"" during your lunch hour and the burgers certainly won't disappoint you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2

I got the ribs, plus a Caesar salad to try to at least look healthy.  The salad was good- they pointed out that the dressing was more a vinaigrette than the typical creamy one, and it was fine.  The veggies were fresh. The ribs came, and had good fries and excellent slaw on the side.  So, more health food!  I tried the bacon-topped ribs, the chipotle, and the Memphis dry rub.  I was prepared to be disappointed- but they weren't bad.  Oh, not great, but there was some flavor in the meat itself, and the texture was about what I like- tender with a little pull.  The sauced ribs were oversauced, but in the case of the bacon ones I guess they need something to hold the pieces on.  And though I figured bacon on top of ribs would be overwhelmingly fatty, it worked fine.  Sort of the ultimate dry rub, savory and salty (okay, it wasn't dry with that sauce, but maybe you can see what I mean.) Service was very good.  The decor is fine, if forgettable.  Pricing was fair- $10 for about half a rack.  They're baby backs, though, so it's a small rack.  I won't be running back here, but if I'm with a group that just has to go, I'll be able to get something decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2

Dave B.,"Delaware, OH",33,3,,2.0,7/19/2016,"I like Fridays in general but there is a bad smell in the bar, sorry to say, but like vomit or mold.   I have been there with my family 3 times to make sure it was not by accident and if it was just a bad day.  All 3 times it smelled.   We cant go there anymore.  Food is good, but smell is bad.  If management is listening please fix the smell so I can come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
Oni W.,"Columbus, OH",0,28,3,1.0,12/22/2016,"Yup, this place sucks now. I havent been in for about 3 months, so I came in for the endless apps, which I looked up online to make sure it was going on before I made the trip here. Of course when I get ready to order, I'm notified they don't have it even though it's on their website. They got rid of my next selection, which was the reuben. I ended up ordering the full rack of ribs, which was more like a half rack if you were to order it anywhere else. The ribs came out semi warm. I had enough points for a free dessert, so I ordered the brownie obsession, which is now half the size it used to be. I should have gone to Makenzie River across the street instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
Jacinta Y.,"Columbus, OH",117,279,103,3.0,2/15/2015,"So if you've been to a Friday's, then you pretty much know what to expect here. It's standard American casual fare. We were there in the evening, and it wasn't especially crowded, so we got seated quite quickly. Overall, I'd say that there wasn't anything that especially stood out here. The food was ok, and the service was decent. That's about the gist of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
Deb K.,"Columbus, OH",2,4,,4.0,10/2/2014,"We stopped here for lunch on Monday and we both ordered burgers. They were delicious and cooked perfectly to order. I substituted grilled asparagus for the endless fries but my meal came with fries. The waiter apologized and quickly brought out my freshly grilled asparagus which was really tasty. I was worried that they would be overcooked, but they still had a nice bite to them and were seasoned well. My husband ordered the Caesar  salad with his meal while I had the tortilla soup. Both were good. Meals also came with choice of chocolate chip or macadamia nut cookie. One really nice aspect was that they brought out a sampler of a beer that my husband wasn't sure if he would like. So he got to taste it before ordering!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
Tiffany M.,"Cleveland, OH",55,174,76,1.0,8/27/2014,"Dear Lord, never again. Yuck yuck yucky yuck.  Boyfriend has the mixed grill with sirloin and chicken, Chicken was so dry It was stiff, stiff enough that it could have been used as a hockey puck. The medium rare sirloin was burnt.  I ordered the prime rib and lobster. No! Bad lobster, you should not look like a dry white turd shriveled up from the exoskeleton of a poor tortured creature named Mr. MyBodyWasWastedOnThis? The prime rib was dry as heck as well.  Sides? Sweet potatoe fries, meh. Mac and cheese? Meh. Potatoes, decent. Cole Slaw, dry. Lemonade? Cool.  Public Service Announcement: honestly save your wallet for something better it WILL be worse then the frozen diner you forgot about from two years ago. But hey the service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
Beth Ann D.,"Charleston, SC",0,7,1,1.0,3/7/2016,"Wait staff was clueless. Husband's food was cold & had to be sent back. Management didn't care at all. Won't be back.  Also, waitstaff continued to call me Babe & Honey. Unprofessional, irritating, and unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbus-2
