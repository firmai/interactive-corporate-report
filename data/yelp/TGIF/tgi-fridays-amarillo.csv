David A.,"Amarillo, TX",81,381,642,3.0,4/15/2007,Not bad- the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta is really good.  For some reason the house salad is always a bit watery and the service is hit or miss.  At least the goofy hats are gone!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amarillo
Alexandria J.,"Gilbert, AZ",36,37,10,1.0,5/22/2013,Possibly the worst customer service ever. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer never saw the bartender again. The other two severs sat at a table and ate. I was never offered a menu or another beer. Shouldn't have paid for the one I did have,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amarillo
Tania H.,"Austin, TX",55,246,403,2.0,8/12/2009,"This was part of the Ambassador hotel, which was downstairs for me :) I had a couple of meals there due to bad weather.. hotel even uses them for In-Room service. First try I had the salmon pasta, it was extremely over salted... I had to mix it with the pasta or better remove the crust to be able to swallow it.. I gave up half way through the lunch...  Service was prompt and friendly. Second time around, I ordered steak, I meant the New York Strip steak medium rare... how hard is that???  apparently quite difficult, my first order came overcooked.. I sent it back... my second order came a sirloin and not a New York strip steak...  I ate I paid and I left. Oh well..!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amarillo
David K.,"Topeka, KS",14,135,18,1.0,4/26/2011,"When you agree to feed a group of people for a meal at a certain price you should ensure that you have the resources (food) to accommodate. Don't come crying to me that you ran out of food. We have ordered this same meal more than 10 times in as many months and never had one of the managers treat us like that. I guess next year we will spend our food budget somewhere else. Besides, the Alfredo sauce was so thin I think whole milk would be thicker right out of the carton. Terrible, I will not be back!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amarillo
