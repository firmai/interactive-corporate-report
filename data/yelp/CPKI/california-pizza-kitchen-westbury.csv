Diane S.,"Syosset, NY",158,364,483,2.0,1/23/2017,"OK, I am particularly annoyed today with CPK for the following reason: On line, looking at their menu with no prices, I see the down at the bottom - lunch 'duos.' yes, I see the word DUO and know what it means... I'm going to get a nice bargain here ! A coworker was on her way there, and I was to text my order. Looking at the menu it starts highlighted: STEP ONE: choose a personal pizza or half sandwich... easy, I can do that... STEP TWO: choose a cup of soup or salad... fantastic - here we go - no problem... then STEP THREE: add your favorite to complete your meal.. there's a few beverages, a few apps and a few desserts - sweet !  bonus like a happy meal... then Jess comes back with my lunch and my change of a TWENTY is 92 cents. WHAAA?? The online menu fails to inform you that Step three - complete your meal, comes at a premium.  This makes me mad. I figured the lunch ""SPECIAL"" would be $8 - $10 $12 ? tops... nope. Lets review the food. 7"" Pizza - I chose the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza - it was dry and a bit hard to chew, not chewy - it was hard to chew, like cardboard is hard to chew.  The toppings were tasty however. Salad: I chose Caesar, a dull standard, I know, because after all - I really only wanted pizza, but it was a lunch special for god's sake. The salad was lost in the huge container it came in - the lettuce not chilled, so wilty would have been a kind word.  The parmesan shaving and the big bricks of crouton made it look good but didn't save it. Last and certainly least - the ""Butter Cake"" I guess this was ok if it is supposed to be one of those Italian desserts that are meant to be stale and break the plastic cutlery.  California Pizza Kitchen...

Albert K.,"Jericho, NY",2,93,,4.0,10/5/2014,"Even though the on in Huntington may be the better one to go to based on ability to get served, I still think this location is still pretty good. The food is consistently good between visits (even between locations) and the service usually good. I haven't had a bad visit yet between the two locations.... Yet. The only drawback is that this location is located in one of the busiest area's on Long Island, thus fairly busy during Friday's and weekend nights, thus it can become a hassle to come here during those times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40

We spent over an hour and a half there and most of the time it was waiting for our server. He spent more time chatting with co workers than attending to the customers.

Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515,4.0,7/9/2013,"After months of listening to a colleague tell me that i had to try you out, i visited with the hubs.  Bored with some of the other establishments in the area we decided to try something new.  So glad we did.  I had a great meal. After calling ahead (saturday night around 9 there was a 15 minute wait) we arrived and were immediately seated at a table in the middle of the room.  The arrangement and décor is on the simple side.  Large picture windows take up most of the wall space on 3 sides of the restaurant and a large curved bar with an exposed kitchen swings you around to the dining room.  The space was open and bright yet still maintained an intimate feel. After several minutes our waiter arrived to take our drink orders.  He was a true delight.  Very friendly and totally accommodating*.   We started with a couple tortilla spring rolls ($8.50 for 2).  #1: Baja chicken (jack, cheddar, corn, black beans, onions, cilantro and  guac.)  Yum.  #2: Thai chicken (sprouts, onions, carrots, cilantro, mozz cheese and peanut sauce.)  Yum yum yum.  Thai was definitely the winner.  Loved the flavors and the peanut sauce was soooo good. Order size is really good, because they're made in, like, 9"" tortillas each roll is cut into 3 pieces and ended up being a larger appetizer than we originally thought.  Next up were the pizzas.  Having never been before we weren't sure of the pizza size and ended up ordering two*.  First up was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken (jerk seasoning, bacon, onions and bell peppers on a thin crust).  Really good flavor.  Had great spice that you could actually see and the crust had that perfect crunch to it.  And they did not skimp on the bacon.  Yay bacon! Second pizza on the table was the Original BBQ Chicken (bbq sauce, smoked gouda, red onions and cilantro on a regular hand tossed crust).  MMmmm I love BBQ chicken pizza.  And this one was top notch.  Sauce was smoky and sweet and there was plenty of chicken.  Both pizzas were good, but I think we both liked the crust of the original better.   After spending the day outside in 97* temperatures it was nice to sit in an air-conditioned establishment and enjoy a quiet meal, and the free refills on sodas AND flavored iced teas/lemonades didn't hurt.  Between the two of us there must have been 10 refills.  And our waiter even poured me an extra one for the road.  So nice of him and really was the icing on the cake.  I'm reserving that 5th star for the next time but our first trip offered up great pizza, good atmosphere, refreshing mango iced tea and I'm absolutely looking forward to my next visit.  *Depending on the level of your hunger one pizza can easily feed 2 people.  Of the 2 pizzas we ordered we took home just a little less than a whole pizza.  Don't get me wrong- it made for an awesome left-overs-lunch the next day but next time I don't think we'll order so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40

Kay L.,"Long Island, NY",0,31,,1.0,11/13/2016,"Bleckkkk...first of all with a minimum of 3-4 workers sitting around at any given time, why isn't the manager requiring that these employees with so little to do pick up a broom or mop and clean up the massively dirty lobby, bathrooms (I won't even share with you what these were like for both my husband and myself), seating area, blinds, etc? It's bad enough that the place was FILTHY (and I am not exaggerating one bit) but the food was lackluster at best. What happened to the delicious sandwiches, wraps, etc. that CPK once offered in addition to tasty pizzas? Where did my beloved portobello mushroom sandwich go? We opted for the pear and Gorgonzola thin pizza, but were sorely disappointed. Had we not been so hungry on the day we ""dined"" here, I would've about-faced and found somewhere else to actually dine. What a disappointment!

We didn't order any drinks.  We sat in the bar area and throughout the night we were watching this working Brandon multitasking.  We were very impressed... SERIOUSLY! We watched him help out everywhere. He knew his way around the kitchen. We also saw he started handing out water bottles to the other workers. WHO would be thoughtful?  Brandon seriously took care of not just the customers but also his coworkers.  Definitely a MANAGERIAL material! And the attitude? Throughout the entire dinner we kept on saying how impressed we were. California Kitchen should totally promote him to run the place.  His persona was just very impressive.  Thanks Brandon!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40

Indra S.,"Floral Park, NY",0,7,5,2.0,4/3/2016,Went there last night (Saturday). Usually this place is easy going but anything that can go wrong did last night. Waited a few mins for table a table for 2 no biggie. As soon as we sat down someone brought over 3  pizza dishes to us. (Not our order-sorry).  Finally our waiter came over took our drink order while we wait for drinks someone brought out 2 more dinner dishes to our table - again not our order. I did both ice this wasn't happening to just us. There were servers circling the dining room with dishes they didn't know which table to serve. I ordered a salad and a main and my friend ordered a pizza. My main course was served (just mine and before my salad came out) we had no small serving plates. When I ask for some they brought over 3 (table was small and we were only 2).. Anyway midway through my main my friend was serve her pizza -- wrong pizza! Sent back pizza only to come back burnt 15 mins later. I received my salad (who knows how many trips the salad took before it found its way to my table) . We also ordered 1 pizza To go and ask that we get it with check. They brought the to go pizza before we were serve our meal.  Who's running the kitchen and managing the orders and staff? It made for a very unpleasant experience. When I made a comment to our waiter that service was poor tonight his reasons was tonight is better than its been. To which I said I won't be coming back because tonight was BAD! I also ordered a coffee and the spoon that came with coffee was so big it barely fit in the tiny coffee cup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40
Gurchurn M.,"New York, NY",80,12,21,2.0,4/20/2015,"Came here with a group of 9, 9 hungry folks.  The place seemed busy. Busy enough for no one to greet us? Sure, I guess.  We were finally seated. The server was kind enough to give us  bread after we ordered our food. 9 pieces of bread.... I busted out laughing. And then the waiter came back in 5mins and said ""oh you guys inhaled that"". Um duh.  We ordered 4 pizzas, all of which are not memorable on a good note. The pizzas, all of them, were chewy and hard.  We order two pastas, the mushroom one and the pesto one. The pesto was good and wish I had that on top of a pizza.  Overall, they didn't seem to have our orders under control. But Jerry, I'm guessing the manager, came over and apologized for the mix up. Thank you for that.    But the food lacked.  Would I comeback? No.  You're better off going to Baci Cafe or Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40
Kenneth K.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",58,77,714,3.0,8/17/2013,"Growing up here is what makes me tolerate this place now and what keeps this rating from going down to two or one. At 20 years old, I've come here for over ten years and so shouldn't be so surprised at what a kiddie farm this is. There are families everywhere, many with toddlers and pre-adolescents. The service is nonetheless swift and deals pretty well with the audiences. Parking is rarely a problem, on the outskirts parking lot of a Costco and Sports Authority. It's just the restaurant that's crowded all the time and groups of people always sitting and standing around the entrance waiting for a table. It can feel chaotic with all the noisy lounging, running and dining. Still, the staff manages to deal with this crowd. As for the food and the CPK chain, I mostly have to talk about discussing food quality here. Whatever you're risking for flavor, the average hot dish will give you the heavy chest feeling and icy throat fire of heartburn with its abundance of oil. The mere thought dissolves my appetite. The food tastes great, sure, if you eat it before it hardens after spending 15 minutes in the open air, but the consequences are still the same. Desserts are decent, still just as fattening. I hear drinking hot fluids afterwards helps alleviate this issue, but I mean that's considering you and you friends have room if you haven't cleaned the plates you've been served; then you just get bloated. The bottle of table wine always confuses me.  But still, if you eat little and fast enough, you might get away with something that I never have. Maybe I should stop coming with my family or something, ordering so much food and all, jeez.........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40

Moises E.,"Westbury, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2016,"This place is soooo bad. Here i am thinking that its regular pizza shop and as i walk in its like a restaurant type. I sat down ordered i might as well try if im already here, BIG MISTAKE!!! I ordered a large pie and some drinks for 3 people. We wait we get some dry bread and oil ? Not sure what that was about but it was so hard. After a while we finally get our pizza !! And guess what ? This is a extra small pizza literally the size of 2 slices in any other shop ! No joke!!! I was so mad and the guy told us "" oh our pizza is kinda small like personal "" yet when we ordered he said nothing or even mentioned there sizes specifically after ordering a large pizza in his face! And the worst part was that the pizza was 16$!!! Never going back here again ! Save ur money and visit a real pizza shop like marios or ginos or alfredos!! Stay away from this place!! A lady next to me literally left after being served without pay because it was ridic!! Stay away and save ur money and get a full sized pizza!!

I felt like I was reliving my friend's birthday party the previous year because she had also wanted to eat the cheesecake factory and we had to go to CPK because it was impossible to get into the cheesecake factory.  I always love any CPK I go to, they are one of the few chain restaurants I actually enjoy eating at. Most chain restaurants I find mediocre or I can't stand them.

Barbara A.,"Westbury, NY",4,35,,1.0,7/27/2017,"My husband said his salmon tasted funny, my salad was less then OK, and my son said his chicken was good, but I never saw such a small portion. We also shared a so so pizza and the price was $90.00 before the tip. Did I mention that the service was also pretty bad. The waiter disappeared until dinner was over, so we never got refills and I never got to tell him he brought the wrong salad dressing, and literally out of nowhere, at the end of the meal he asked if we wanted water. So if you want to go to a fairly dumpy place, have the worst service and less then average food, for a pretty hefty price, go to the California Pizza Kitchen.  There are three chain restaurants right there in a row on Old Country Road, California Pizza Kitchen, Olive Garden, and Ruby Tuesdays, and the California Pizza Kitchen is by far the worst and most expensive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=20

While not high level dining it's not McDonalds.  Service is table side and efficient. Food is fresh and the selection of salads and healthy choices is better than I expected.  Personal Sicilian pizza and a fresh vegetable salad were good choices this particular visit. Not a full bar but wine and beer available. Worthwhile experience.

Usually my family goes here for dinner, but the lunch deal is great! I had the pizza and salad ( all their salads are pretty good) and was satisfied! The pizza is such a treat! It was a personal pie that did the job for me and the salad was just enough. Want extra dressing? No problem!  My son had the kids cheese pizza with added black olives ( no extra charge) and he too was satisfied. My bill came up to less than $20 including soft drinks.   For dinner, I usually get the chicken Milanese which is a nice portion. The chicken is tasty and the salad is delicious! My husband loves the spinach and asparagus spaghettini or the chicken piccata. I've never had a bad dish here really!   The kids are always happy with their orders off the kids menu.

Alexandra L.,"Manhattan, NY",891,579,2064,4.0,5/13/2015,"The Quick: This might be a chain, but the food is so delicious and worth the wait. Jamaican Jerk chicken pizza and the avocado egg rolls are mouth watering (just avoid glancing at the calorie facts).  The Details: Now that most chain restaurants in New York have to put the calorie facts next to the entree options, I feel like there's literally nothing I can eat and not feel guilty about (always trying to lose 5 lbs). That being said the California pizza kitchen is definitely calorific so go into that expecting you'll have to do a few more lunges afterwards.  They recently made their pizza smaller to be less gluttonous, and probably less expensive to make. Either way the food is delicious. I dream about the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza and the avocado eggrolls as mentioned above (comes with a fantastic dipping sauce that I always ask for extra of) . Other winners are the BBQ Chicken, California club, anything with chicken and/or bacon really. It's always crowded, but it's a fun spot to go for comfort food (yes pizza is my potatoes and gravy style comfort food).

The tuscan hummus is amazing!!!  You can order it without the tomatoes they put on top.  They serve it with your choice of white or wheat bread which seems to be hot pizza dough.

My son ventured from his normal pepperoni and tried the Hawaiian kids portion.

M K.,"New York, NY",0,32,,1.0,11/15/2014,"I had one of the worst dinners I've ever had at this venue.  Going with my wife, we initially requested a booth.  The person at the front led us to a booth that had the seat completely ripped up.  I obviously asked for a different seat, at a non-booth table. Next, we were seated and left wondering who our waiter was for 10 minutes.  Following this, the waiter came out and took our order for a couple of appetizers, a flat bread mushroom/spinach flatbread and tortilla spring rolls.  My wife asked for bread and butter as well.  The waiter said he would be right back.  15-20 minutes later, the waiter came back with the appetizers and bread together.  Why didn't they give is the bread while the appetizers were cooking? The appetizers came out cold, the waiter offered to heat it up, we took him up on the offer.  In the mean time, we started on the bread.  It was stale, definitely not fresh.  The butter was spoiled, it tasted terrible.  Because it was not fresh, the cold bread just tasted terrible. 5 minutes later, the appetizers came back, they were basically around the same temperature as when we got them.  The waiter asked if he could reheat them again, I told him it was fine, we would deal with it.  The actual taste on the spring rolls was weird, it had an odd smell to them.  I'm not sure what it was.  The flatbread was lukewarm and not really crispy, because it was made long ago.  Why must everything be lukewarm, and why can't the food be fresh? We ordered a basil pesto penne for the main entree.  It was also lukewarm, and actually quite dry.  The flavor was just ok, almost decent, not something I would ever seek out. The dessert was a chocolate soufflé.  This was actually good, the only part of the whole meal that was something that had taste.

It wasn't that crowded when we got there..however by the time we were finished and leaving it was PACKED. Service was BAD. This waitress obviously didn't want to be tipped. She came over to our table to take our drink order about 10 minutes after we were seated. When she finally came around to bring our drinks, she didn't apologize for the long wait, rather put down our drinks and LEFT. Yes, LEFT without taking our FOOD ORDERS. WE WERE RAVENOUS. When she finally took our orders, it took another 30 or more minutes for the food to come because the ""kitchen was backed up"". People who sat down AFTER us were ALREADY eating. Kids were getting cranky and couldn't sit still. Food finally arrived. We ate, and ordered some more food to go for the parents who didn't join us in our meal. We asked for the check as well because we figured it would take a long time for her to bring us that check anyway, we didn't want to stay there any longer. Long after the take out food arrived, we were STILL on the seat, waiting for the check. Unfortunately, I didn't bring cash that day so I paid with card and had to wait for the waitress to bring me my receipt to sign.

We were seated right away by the host and the server came over pretty quickly. He asked what we would like to order and we asked for the dessert menu. We ordered the cake and then we were asked if we wanted anything else so I decided on ordering coffee.  The cake arrived in a good amount of time and he came back to say the coffee was brewing. The cake and coffee were very good. No sooner than we put our forks down he asked if we wanted anything else. The tone was a bit off putting so I assumed it was closing time. It was only 10 PM and the restaurant closed at 11 PM. We continued to sit and chat and then he came back and said do you want the check now?  Again it was rudely stated and like he was rushing us out of the restaurant.  We paid and he had the nerve to ask if we needed change. Ummm taking a $6 tip for yourself for dessert and coffee for one. No. The price didn't warrant it and neither did his attitude.  I noted that he was a lot more friendly with the table beside us.

My BF has his usual chicken piccata.  I come during the slower hours, so that may have helped. The reason for this place getting 4 stars is based on how we were discriminated upon entering. The hostess was in the front with a waitress having a quick convo...whatever...and the waitress gave us one look...and blatantly shook her head and said, ""uh uh, don't put them by me..."" did some scratching off on the section floor plan that the hostess has, and continued, ""i'ma change my section!""   I didn't care...because there was no way I wanted to tip or give my money to THAT miserable, obnoxious, judgemental and possibly racist person! Overall, I get great service from other servers. I've even seen the servers do a great job. Not only do they help the customers, but they help one another without question.  I'm pretty observant of servers because my sister was one at a 4 star restaurant in Manhattan. I've also done my fair share of hospitality work and know it is NOT easy!  Servers start stereotyping the kinds of people who come in, for example: ""asians and tourists don't tip"", or, ""that family always eats everything then complains and wants everything comped."" I know it's done. But seriously, don't freaking say it out loud or in front of people...ESPECIALLY CUSTOMERS!!! I would never mistreat a server.

My husband and I haven't been to CPK for over 5 years so we decided our Friday night dinner will be spent here since all the other good restaurants around had a long wait while this place had no wait at all. We were seated right away when we arrived and 10 minutes later, the server finally came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. He came back with our water but forgot my lemon. I reminded him shortly after but didn't get my lemon until about 15 minutes later. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer, a sausage with pineapple thin crust pizza and my husband got the mahi mahi tacos. The spinach dip came out about 10 minutes later and it looked watery (not creamy).  The dip was not cheesy and lacking all ingredients. I could honestly say the spinach artichoke dip from Trader Joe's was better than this. Our entrees took FOREVER to come out, it wasn't even that busy and it took like 40 minutes before it finally came out. The pizza was the WORST I've ever had in my life (at this CPK location)! It was soft and soggy like undercooked pizza and lacking sausages in some areas. My husband said his mahi mahi tacos was ok, it needed more fish in them and the salsa dip looked rotten. The service here was subpar, server was not friendly nor attentive. My pizza cost the same as all the other specialty pizzas; if I knew that was the case, I would've just ordered a regular supreme.

I could've understand that it was a mistake, but the fact that he laughed and then I saw him laughing every time he looked over the table just pissed me off. Then the head waitress came over and said oh I just put a new piece in as a rush for you he'll be here in a minute and walked away like no one apologized, I shouldn't of had to pay for pizza. Then the pizza came and it was dry, burned, and disgusting.  Did I mention that I had a SWAT away little flies, probably fruit flies, during the entire time we were there?

My tried and true favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza with bacon and pineapples! CPK lets you split your pies in half for like a $1.00 charge I believe. So you can try two flavors at once and I do it every time I come here. If you're into salads, the BBQ chicken chopped salad is amaze-balls lol  They have a rewards program and if you come here you can rack up some freebies. I would suggest anyone to sign up.

I usually get the BBQ Chicken Pizza on Thin Crust and my Mom is more of a menu explorer. When we went last she got the Garlic Cream Fettuccine. It was so good! OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! The pasta tasted fresh and homemade. Not like Olive Garden or Bertucci's which more tastes like of of the box(not that there is anything wrong with Olive Garden's rendition). I was shocked and amazed by the pasta. There really was no garlic flavor, so if you want a dish with heavy garlic flavor, I would not recommend this one. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that is was just regular Fettuccine in a cream sauce. For dessert, I usually get the Butter Cake, but I can find it to be a little on the dry side. Definitely do not get it without ice cream. This time, I decided to try the Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake. It was the best decision ever! It is so good and the vanilla bean sauce makes it even better. It gives it a nice flavor without overpowering the chocolate. The only thing is, there is no chocolate sauce in the middle, so I wouldn't really call it a soufflé. I will definitely make California Pizza Kitchen on of my regulars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury

We sat right down, got served really fast, and the place was calm and quiet. That was nice. Ahhh. Our server though, for a random Wednesday, was a little questionable. Every other table got bread, not us, and I definitely got the ""I'm better than you"" vibe, snotty! Then, when the pizzas came, it seemed like they shrunk! No fair! They were delicious, but definitely definitely definitely smaller than the last few times we were there. This place is a little pricey for such small pizzas. Maybe my appetite has grown since the last time I came, but I really remember leaving CPK super full and carrying a doggy bag.

Since then their operation has steadily declined in terms of service, food and the amount of people who actually come to eat here. Any time I've placed an order for takeout in the last 2 years or so I've waited an insanely long amount of time and received food so cold it was inedible. The staff has been completely incompetent and unapologetic on multiple occasions (took over an hour past quoted time to bring out food for a takeout order and an additional 30 minutes of nonsense to swipe a credit card correctly for 'curbside pickup', then gave a nasty attitude when they didn't receive a tip).

Gilbert T.,"Uniondale, NY",1,44,1,4.0,1/12/2014,"I came here with my family today for a late lunch. We have been to CPK years ago, but haven't been back recently. Our experience was fairly good. We started with a Half Waldorf Chicken Salad and a Half Caramelized Peach Salad. I have had the Waldorf Chicken Salad previously and I remember enjoying it a lot (this was actually the only reason why I convinced my family to go back to CPK--for their Waldorf Chicken Salad). I was ecstatic to have my salad and devoured it in no time flat. The variety of textures, the crunchy pears, the creamy bleu cheese, the soft red halved grapes, with the leafy greens was just as I remembered it. However, my sister did not like her caramelized peach salad, but put up with it and finished it. She was nauseous afterwards but she sucked it up. For our main entrees, my parents shared a Mushroom Sausage and Pepperoni Hand tossed pizza which was good! I'm a big pepperoni fan and there was a good balance between the three flavors. Highly recommend it. I shared a California Club pizza with my sister and it was okay. There was lots of lettuce and not enough dressing. It was kind of dry and sort of bland. I wanted something sort of citrusy/vinegary to cut through the avocado. If there was a little more dressing and salt and pepper, it would've been excellent.  My other sister had the ""Two In a Bowl"" soup. It was split corn and pea soup. She finished the entire bowl and really enjoyed it. No complaints there. Tip: Be adventurous with the menu. What i LOVE about this place is that they encourage adventurous eaters who are willing to try new things. If you don't like something you decided to try, they'll replace it with something you do love. Such a great policy. Also, if you get the flavored ice tea, make sure to mix it before enjoying.

Not sure if the waitress was on her first day on the job or what the situation was but other staff/ manager walked around and had nothing to say with the obvious discomfort. For starters we ordered wine which was left on the table for us to pour on our own. The waitress did not know the obvious difference between Pinot Grigio and Pinot noir (red/ white). From appetizers to entrees and then to dessert all dishes were left on the table. We were so uncomfortable that we just kept pushing the plates towards the end of the table. Dessert was served without spoons. Once requested we were handed 5 serving spoons that were nearly impossible to fit in our mouths.

I am a particular fan of their flavored lemonades -- kiwi is my favorite -- as well as their tortilla soup.  In the past, this soup was a tomato base and they also offered an Adobe Chicken Chowder.  The Chowder has since replaced the original Tortilla recipe and the chicken has been removed from the equation.  For a real treat, add crushed red pepper to the soup. As for the new sandwiches, my dad and I like to order one of each (CPK Club and the Cranberry Walnut one) and share half.  This comes with soup, so it's a good deal.

Dont go by the pictures on their website because it does not do those magic bites any justice.

Peter B.,"Little Neck, NY",5,61,,4.0,3/12/2013,"First things first, this isn't a fast food place, if you come here you're gonna sit for a while while they cook your pizza. They have some weird/funky options for appetizers, but the pizzas are the real star of this show. The jerk chicken pizza is easily the best pizza they have on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",828,2232,20,3.0,8/5/2007,"Decent food, sterile atmosphere. I wound up sitting at the ""bar"" only because the wait was long - it is ok but the bar area is wide open and kind of overlooks the kitchen so, in my opinion, it is not such a great place to sit and chat with your S.O. or whatever because you feel like you are on display - the whole restaurant is behind you without the benefit of a dividing wall. That aside, the food is fine- the pizzas have some odd combinations but then again, to me anything other than mushrooms and sausage seem odd on pizza.  The odd toppings are tasty though and I guess that is how they built a whole chain around it. Service was decent but not spectacular - nor was I expecting anything more than what we got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Katiemarie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,17,,1.0,5/14/2011,"This place is utterly disgusting, the people are nasty, and the pizza looks and smells horrible. Too much money for anything in this store, when the food is horrible too begin with.  They call themselves California Pizza kitchen but yet its not even in california. I dont like this pleace at all, it looks dirty too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Billy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,370,3,4.0,7/19/2010,"When CPK first started out I was blown away at all the crazy combinations they offered. Years later, it now seems pretty common place to get pizza anyway you want, though I still find CPK is still pretty decent when it comes to hard to find pizzas. I tend to go with the Roasted pepper and goat cheese pizza. The combo of goat cheese and the spicy peppers is consistently great and the dough they use is nice and chewy. The avocado egg rolls with dipping sauces are good as well as their foccaccia. I was a litle dissapointed they took the shrimp scampi pizza off the menu but when I ordered take out, the guy who took my order was nice enough to note that they could make it for me. The curb side check in, for those interested, went pretty smoothly. I ordered before getting on the road and once parked I probably waited five minutes for my food and my check to be returned to me. It was great having a parking space right in front and not having to wait in the busy lobby which this place has because of the crowds of families dining out. Overall it's a good place to bring kids because of free refills, fun combinations of pizza, and other menu offerings like soups and pastas. I'm sure there are better pizzas out there but CPK will always be a favorite for hard to find and consistently great pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Audrey K.,"New York, NY",287,376,559,3.0,5/5/2010,"Aside from the obvious - their pizza's are fun, creative and yummy.  It's not the best you can find but worth checking out, especially with this location, if you are picking between CPK and Olive Garden - go for the CPK! They let you mix soups in a bowl - and oddly enough, have AMAZING jambalaya here!  It's spicy and flavorful and impressive.  Veryvery surprising!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Jose S.,"Flushing, NY",30,36,11,4.0,7/12/2010,"This place is great. My first time here and I am in love with the food, the service, everything! I tried the Thai chicken pizza and suddenly it's my new favorite food. My friends looked like they enjoyed the food as well. One had the california club which looked like a salad on a pizza and the other had a white pizza. The best part was when the food arrived. Everything smelled so good and looked even better. I could not wait to dig in. We all commented on how fresh the ingredients tasted and how filling the meals were without the bloated feeling. Tried the chocolate souffle cake for dessert and I am glad I did. They used my favorite ice cream brand (Haagen Daz). Need I say more? Service was great and the waiter was very friendly and checked in on us frequently. Cannot wait till my next visit. Until then dreams of fresh pizza and mouth watering desserts will haunt me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Leila Y.,"Woodside, NY",9,173,101,3.0,3/18/2012,"My best friend and I came here after shopping at Roosevelt Field Mall. When we arrived we noticed there was a long wait, but we didnt expect it to be that long. We waited 45 minutes before we were seated. By the time we were seated, we were starving! We ordered a Tuscan Hummus as a appetizer. It was pretty good. After that we decided to share a Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. It was also really yummy. The worst part of our meal was the drinks. I currently cant remember what we ordered. It was some kind of fruit non virgin pina colada. It was so sweet! It was such a waste, both of us only drink a little of it and decided to order water instead. Besides from the drinks everything else wasn't bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Jenny L.,"Elmont, NY",3,17,,1.0,7/29/2012,The food was good but the waitstaff sucked.. 45 mins for 3 salads and when a full glass of water was spilled all over the table the one waitress just watched me clean it up and we had to go find our own napkins.. The bathrooms were a disgrace and no one came to check and see if everything was fine. Was very close to walking out!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Ralph D.,"New York, NY",0,25,,3.0,6/11/2010,"What a shame.  The food was excellent compared to other chains at this price range. But when I go out to eat, I go because I want to be served.  The Chain should tell its waitresses that they are in the customer service business and that they should kiss the customers a$$. Unfortunately, not only was she lazy and some what arrogant, she even screwed up our doggy bag by giving us someone else's leftover. I am amazed at the level of incompetency sometimes, but that stems from management.   3 star comes from a 5 star for food and 1 star for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Greek P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/14/2012,"Went there for dinner.    Ordered our entrees and a soup for appetizer.   The drinks were served fast.    Were brought out quickly.   Service was beyond slow.   Waitstaff seemed like they don't give a crap.   Soup was brought out with the entrees when it should have been brought out way before.   Anyhow, no problem with that.   Service SUCKED!    The food was good.  We had no complaints about but the management -owner/s have to be there to monitor the staff.   Get people who are hungry to serve and are willing to make $$$$ on tips.   These young kids have no clue what's going on.   Waitor brought me my change 5 bucks short and after speaking to the person realized it was short and gave me the 5 bucks.  Honest mistake?   Don't know.    Again, the food was good-no complaints- service awful! mangement has to screen waitors alot better and clean house.    Experience SUCKED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
Kathleen B.,"Long Island, NY",135,451,17,2.0,9/1/2008,"I'm a chef.  I like chain restaurants because of their consistency.  I was craving BBQ pizza and a glass of White Zinfandel (lol, I know, the HORROR).   I walked into this place and I instantly noticed a funny odor.  It smelled like there was something wrong with the dishwasher and santizer or something. Only at dessert did I realize that it was the plate that my dessert was served on that smelled this funky smell.  CPK Westbury, please fix your sanitizer.  I bet it's not operating at the proper temp right now.  I hope I don't get sick tonight....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120

Adrienne B.,"New York, NY",40,317,5,4.0,10/27/2010,"Me being a fan of CPK is new.  I avoided it for many years because I just wasn't blown away by the offerings and didn't really think they had any good healthier options.  When I realized I had a wheat allergy I really avoided it.  Recently, my Husband and I have tried it out again, he was always a fan, and I realized it is better than I remember.  They've got some great salad options now- and my husband has been enjoying trying the various pizza options.  The waitstaff at this location are friendly and efficient and the place overall has a nice vibe to it.  We'll continue to head there for sure!  I think it is a great weekend lunch option when you've been on your feet running errands all morning!  My favorite salad is the thai peanut one, and the white corn guac is just the right amount of appetizer to get you going, but not leave you too full for the meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120
