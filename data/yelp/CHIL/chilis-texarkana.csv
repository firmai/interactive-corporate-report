Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1282,673,344,4.0,12/3/2016,"We stopped in at this Chili's on our way to Hot Springs. My wife and I were both hungry and it was lunchtime. Service was quick, promptly and our food was delivered as we ordered it. My wife had a salad and I ordered the beef tacos. Yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Mike P.,"Biloxi, MS",13,5,1,1.0,8/13/2017,Just left after sitting at a table for 15 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a waiter. Other tables looked like they were still waiting on there food. We thought we would try and see if it had improved any. We will not go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Shayne H.,"Bradley, AR",0,13,5,1.0,3/17/2017,Loved chilis several years ago but no longer a fan. We go a very long time between visits hoping it will get better........it doesn't. Food very slow coming our waitress would disappear to the point we had to ask a waiter for assistance 2x (his name was Chris he was great). Chicken strips were tough and  has a different batter than they used originally.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Krystal H.,"Atlanta, TX",27,42,79,4.0,12/19/2016,"This Chilis is one of my favorite local  chains. The food is always hot and yummy and I love the new texmex items they've added to the menu. Stopped in here today to get a gift card and had a late lunch and throughly enjoyed our visit and our waiter, Nick, was awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Brian L.,"Hooks, TX",63,10,18,1.0,11/2/2015,"Terribly disappointed. This is my 3rd time here. Food was late, cold and just didn't  seem like there was a lot of give a damn involved in its cooking. Had to send my black beans back because they were cold, had to cancel my daughters soup portion of her soup and salad because the rest of us were halfway done with our meals before we were notified of the delay. Bottomless chips and salsa were good till the third tray (3 adults, one pre-teen eating) which actually had cold chips. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
JoAnn H.,"Texas City, TX",3,24,1,1.0,3/8/2016,"Wow. Wish I had read the reviews before coming to this particular Chilis. We were passing thru and had a lot of options near our hotel, but since we had stopped at several Chilis during our 2 week road trip we thought it would be fine.  Bad idea.  First of all our server, Brittany, didn't even acknowledge we were there for a good 10 minutes. Btw, the place was not crowded at all.  The table near us had a different make server who really seemed on the ball. Oh well, just our luck. To make a long story short, after finally getting our drinks, by the time she brought our food, it was barely warm. I wasn't about to send it back or I may have still been there. Just paid and left. Doubt I'll be in Texarkana again but it has also soured us enough not to go to Chilis anymore. Shame...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Paula G.,"Emmet, AR",0,44,1,1.0,8/20/2016,Horrible !!!!!  No hostess at front door ! Numerous tables to be cleaned !! Lots of customers waiting to be seated! I love Chilis and we were very disappointed !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Amanda B.,"Plano, TX",25,29,17,1.0,5/15/2015,"We are here from Dallas for a college graduation photo shoot so we decided to eat here, since it's Chili's after all. Big mistake. The lady at the hotel told us to avoid it due to bad service but we didn't listen. The service was ok. Not that great.  When we walked in, there were 5 employees standing at the front and we were not greeted by any of them. My coworkers and I looked at each other and I commented that it felt like we were inconveniencing them.  As a paying customer, you should never ever feel like you are inconveniencing the staff at a restaurant (or anywhere).  So after several minutes of waiting, we were sat.   We sat at a freshly cleaned table. So freshly cleaned that the seats and table were still wet from the dingy bleached water (that had probably been sitting out all day).  So our bottoms ended up soaking up the excess cleaning liquid.   I had ordered a black bean burger and when it came out, it was overcooked to the point of hardness. It was awful. There were little black specks from grill all over the burger - I felt like it was speaks of meat that had been cooked on the grill before.  The lettuce was wilty and the pickled were awful. I had ordered extra pickles because they are made in-house and I've had them before and they were delicious, but not these. These were dried up and gross. I felt like they had been sitting out all day.     We will never eat here again. We come here every fall and spring to shoot the graduation so I imagine that we will spend our money elsewhere.  I don't think I'll be able to step foot into another Chili's for a loooooong time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Amanda V.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,7,1.0,5/4/2016,"I've had it with this Chilis. I stopped going for about 3 years bc they had roaches on the tables, chip machines, ect every time we went! This time, it was ice cold, they brought us BROWN, CRUSTY mashed potatoes and I showed our server and we literally finished our meal before we got the replacement. The entire restaurant looks grimy and slimy. Dirty glasses brought to the table, ect...just not a clean place although the food is good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Justin S.,"Quincy, MA",0,4,1,4.0,10/24/2015,"Michael was our server and he was very cheerful, prompt, and had a winning personality. Our food that my Wife and our friends enjoyed was all just about perfect and we all couldn't have asked for a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Jarrid S.,"Hot Springs, AR",35,29,4,1.0,12/26/2015,Been here for an hour... Ordered a burger and fries... Took 10 minutes to get a beverage and now I continue to wait for food..... Service here leaves a lot to be desired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Kim I.,"Ponder, TX",40,6,,1.0,6/4/2015,Awful service at lunch time. Took 45 minutes to get our food.  Everything was COLD. Won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Tiffany P.,"Texarkana, TX",303,28,27,5.0,12/19/2014,So much better than befire..minimal wait. Super server ..excellent presentation. .and fantastic food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Melissa B.,"Garland, TX",131,510,173,1.0,4/13/2012,"Booth was dirty, server was rude. I ordered a lunch combo with salad. I wasn't asked what kind of dressing I wanted and was brought a salad covered in too much ranch dressing. She left my fries off of my sandwich plate then when I asked she stated she didn't notice. Several employees could be heard talking loudly about customers who'd just left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Philip P.,"Dallas, TX",19,62,46,2.0,2/21/2015,Be prepared to be there at least 2 hours during lunch.  Service was extremely slow.  Food was decent...just not worth being there 2 hours.  We thought our waiter actually took a lunch break at one point.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Josh W.,"Bedford, TX",15,31,7,2.0,1/13/2015,"First time here and I doubt ill be back. The wait was short and the service was good, but the food was just bad. I had shrimp tacos, and while it wasn't terrible, the flavor was off (i think it was whatever the white sauce is) and the shrimp was overcooked (read: tough). Since there are several options in Texarkana, I would look elsewhere in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
James S.,"Claremore, OK",39,14,,2.0,1/14/2015,"Not a lot to say about this  place other than slow, slow, slow!  No wonder it's not very busy at lunch time despite being near a hospital, shopping mall and other retailers. Hope there is a retirement home near by as I may be of age to join by the time I get out of here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Allen M.,"Tullahoma, TN",32,135,4,2.0,4/26/2013,"Hostesses wouldn't make eye contact when I walked in, going toward the restroom. Same thing when I went by them to the bar area. Justin is a great bartender, working the wrong place. The building is old and shows wear every place you look. I wasn't about to order food. I gave them an extra star because the beer was cold and good price on happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Carla H.,"Texarkana, TX",0,8,5,2.0,6/15/2014,"Ate there Tuesday night after driving in from New Orleans. Not a pleasant experience at all. Took forever to even place our order for beverages, hostess took it then they never came until we asked our waitress about it when she came much later to take our dinner order. 3 tables around us stayed dirty for time we were there. Food was mediocre, for the price of our bill it should have been superb! Seemed that the waitress had the entire side to take care of so not sure if service is her fault or management for not staffing more. If they don't correct the problem soon, there will be an empty Chilis bldg in Texarkana!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana
Amanda L.,"Texarkana, TX",3,7,4,1.0,2/12/2015,Well I hate to say it but chilis has really declined food is sucky staff is not helpful At all both times I've went in last month my server didn't refil our drinks unless asked they way over salted our wings and it took forever to come out anyways,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Milt K.,"Silvis, IL",0,14,,1.0,12/31/2014,We ate at Chili's on 30 Dec 2014 at 7:00pm.  The worst service I have experienced at a Chili's restaurant! The servers were horrible as well as the host. I will never eat there again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Robby D.,"Houston, TX",0,2,8,3.0,12/8/2014,"Decent service for a busy lunch.  The staff smiled but didn't talk much.  I ordered the sante fe salad.  It was ok. I didn't expect iceberg lettuce for a ten dollar salad, but I did end up eating it all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Robert C.,"Texarkana, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2015,"I went to the chilis here in Texarkana for a couple beers and appetizers. Unlike all the other Chili's I went to I was informed that there was no happy hour and we were generally treated as and inconvenience.!!! What was especially discouraging I emailed the corporate office and to this date have not received a response from Chili's office or the management of the Chili's here in town. I would suggest with the proximity of other restaurants, I would avoid this Chili's and go to those other restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Dan L.,"Denton, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/2/2015,"Having dined with Chili's since they opened the first unit on Greenville Ave in Dallas I can say I've been a fan. However, I'll never darken the door of this store again. Ordered the triple dipper appetizer combo and was really pretty excited about it. Was so disappointed when I saw the batter on the fried pickles was light colored and sliding off them . . . hardly cooked at all. Sent them back and ordered the panko crusted rings as a replacement, the waiter came out later to say the pickles came out the same (I did not ask her to try it again) and so brought me the requested rings . . . limp and greasy. The sliders were so overcooked I could hardly choke them down. Then the loaded potato skins, also dripping with grease and so overcooked as to be rubbery. I was hungry in a hurry to get to a meeting or would have sent it all back. Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Robert G.,"Texarkana, TX",8,235,131,1.0,10/21/2013,"Shabbiness is not chic.  The place is shabby inside.  AC ducting has rust spots, and the booth seating is worn down to the padding. Menus were dirty, and the tableware none too clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Joyce W.,"Thoroughbred Estates, TX",1,2,,1.0,7/12/2013,Store opened at 10:45 and we were there at 10:50. Ordered a trio Fajita to share with my husband. At 11:20 waiter came to apologize that a pick up order had been called in so our order was delayed. It came 5 min later. The corn tortillas were old and VERY tough. Husband is allergic to the flour so had to have corn. The grout on the tiled tables were very soiled as was the bath room grout as well. Will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20

M P.,"Dallas, TX",29,43,22,1.0,9/17/2011,"I have visited this location for years when passing by on I-30. Always a solid mediocre dining experience..until today. Upon arrival everyone was placed on the wait list and given the vibrating beeper. But wait the dining room is far from filled, well with customers. What is was filled with was dirty, uncleared tables.  I still didn't panic and bolt back out of the door...but I should have. Two appetizers ordered, they arrived at the table several minutes apart. In all fairness the young man who was the server appeared to try to please but when he required prompting for silverware and later for plates from which to eat the appetizers....I came to believe poor (very poor) training was the problem. For the rest of the meal he kept drinks filled and took away dishes pretty well. The area remained cluttered with uncleared and half cleared tables throughout my entire visit.  I couldn't help but notice the adjacent table of five adults and their female server. A man brought out a tray of food, which he balanced on one hand while passing out food with the other hand. Yes...passing out!  Exaggerated leaning across diners to reach the other side of the table with a plate of food and the large tray still balanced on the other hand was comical to watch...and the diners wisely intercepted the plates and served each other. I couldn't believe my eyes. In short order four dinners were on the table...but wait there are five diners. The man, who I've decided looks like a used car or maybe a used book salesman, departs and it becomes painfully obvious to all the fifth diner's meal may not materialize. Several long minutes later four eaters have drained their beverages, offered bites to their hungry companion and are all looking around hoping to be rescued. In a while longer the waitress appears with the missing food and turns to apparently get more beverages. The diners group five mugs together and sure enough new drinks arrive. The empties are ignored and the server went away again for long enough to cause her diners more distress. She returns and is apparently asked for the check. She walks away empty handed again even though there are now stacks of empty plates in addition to the ten or more now empty mugs. I can't watch any more! It's like a bad sit com! My server apologized when I commented on the ""apparent negative energy"" in the restaurant. I thanked him for service ""that was just fine"" and that I was thankful not to have been seated one table over.  I won't give this particular Chili's another try for quite a while to come. If any owner, manager or franchisor reads my remarks....there is serious work to be done here, get at it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Keri J.,"Jacksonville, AR",3,21,,1.0,10/11/2011,We have frequented this restaurant for years and have never had a problem until recently.   The service was VERY slow and it wasn't busy. We weren't given silverware or plates to go with our appetizer (which was cold) it was just a very negative experience. We left and ate dinner somewhere else and won't be going back for a long while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Christy C.,"Texarkana, TX",2,2,,1.0,7/7/2012,"If I could rate a NEGATIVE 5 stars, I would! We waited for over THIRTY minutes to get a table. There were several clean & EMPTY tables when we walked in. After the ridiculous wait time, since they were NOT busy, I asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She acted like it irritated her to even look. When I commented on the empty tables, she said they were trying to clean up & seat people. I told her that at least 3 of the tables I could see had been clean since we got there. She rolled we eyes at me. I handed her the beeper and told her we would take our business elsewhere, where we would be appreciated! We came to Texas Roadhouse, where we were seated almost immediately, they are happy to see us, and the food is better anyway!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
Janelle L.,"Jacksonville, FL",41,11,1,2.0,12/17/2010,"Went to this place at around 3:30 PM on a Friday.  Felt like we were bothering the wait staff for coming in during an ""off peak"" time.  Only ordered dessert... Molten lava cake.  Which was good I admit, however, it was weird to find ICE pieces in the ice cream.  It was like the ice cream melted, they put it back in the freezer and it got freezer burn.  hmm... Oh yeah and we ordered spinach artichoke dip.  The cheese wasn't melted and it was not hot... Service was so so... found it odd that they didn't even have the check holders.  The waitress just handed us the bill... Don't think I'll be returning to this place.. Not recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texarkana?start=20
