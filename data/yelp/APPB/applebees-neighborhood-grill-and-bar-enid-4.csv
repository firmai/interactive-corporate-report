Jack M.,"Denver, CO",7,9,,2.0,1/27/2009,"Our appetizer was good. Our main courses were also good, however the side dishes were cold and were obviously prepared well ahead of the main course.  The service was a bit slow and some requests that were made went unfulfilled.  Overall, I would avoid this ""neighborhood grill"" for something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4?start=20
The M.,"Kemp, TX",2,61,38,1.0,6/3/2011,Absolutely nasty gross and dirty. While I was waiting for 25 minutes for my Togo order at the bar a roach crawled up on top of the bar! I killed it and showed the bar tender he acted as if it wasn't a big deal! Must be a common occurrence ! Will never step foot in there again !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4?start=20
Cassi T.,"Enid, OK",2,42,,1.0,10/14/2010,I refuse to eat here anymore the service is horrible and the food is below average the only thing that they have going for them is they do have a really good bartender.. which your going to need if you plan on eating there!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4?start=20

Dwight C.,"Hemet, CA",140,233,76,4.0,10/19/2017,Not sure why others rate this restaurant as low as they do but we had a good experience with present wait staff. Am family really with the chain and the food quality was as good as any Applebee's I have dined at. Building is an older property but is clean with good food. Parking is next to the building and easy access,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Greg B.,"Warner Robins, GA",46,20,2,1.0,1/4/2018,"Don't be in a hurry is very right. It took forever to be served food and the waitress was very inattentive and forgetful. When food finally arrived, they in no way resembled the pictures. I ordered a steak salad and the lettuce was soggy with like 4 tiny pieces of steak. My wife ordered a quesadilla sandwich. She got a tiny little hamburger patty and the tortilla was a mess. The kids got burgers and they said they were greasy. Not recommended in any way, put this place out of its misery please.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Connor C.,"McDonough, GA",5,1,,1.0,11/1/2017,It feels like the entire Applebee's restaurant sprouted legs just so it could saunter over & crap directly into my stomach cavity.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Shelley C.,"Benton, KS",51,420,1567,5.0,5/29/2016,"One of the few times I started a review before the food came, my level of disappointment is already boundless. We came for half-price appetizers. They have THREE, count them, THREE choices. Spinach dip, boneless wings and cheese stix. Really? That's it?  We get several choices in Kansas, depending on which one we go to. I wonder why they only offer 3 things here. I'm hoping the portions are decent and the food is tasty. For now, I'm sulking, because I was looking forward to sliders, or steak towers, or Asian tacos at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
LaDonna W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",30,1,,1.0,7/20/2017,"Service was okay but waited almost a hour for food. My husband ordered medium rare steak got well done. I got oriental chicken salad, dry dry dry! We hadn't been here for awhile so thought we would give it another try. Won't be going for a long while if ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Sharon A.,"Kingfisher, OK",111,10,15,1.0,9/5/2016,When we arrived at Applebee's it was quite a while before anyone even acknowledged we were there. At the time there were only three other tables in the whole restaurant that had people sitting at them.  When someone finally came to seat us they said they would go clean a table for us and be right back. That's when we looked around and noticed that EVERY single table in the restaurant was dirty. Like really....every table. There was even a a guy and his kid clearing a table for themselves to sit at. Once we were seated we had a chance to look around and see how dirty everything was. Dirty dishes were piled everywhere. That's when we decided if it was that dirty for what we could see...how dirty is it in the back? So we left and went to the clean restaurant next door.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Michelle D.,"Enid, OK",5,128,44,1.0,2/29/2016,"What a difference  a few years make. Went to dinner here with my husband. Hostess was not very friendly. We attempted to order nachos as appetizer. We were promptly  informed they were out of nachos. Seriously?  We had to ask for silverware. Next, the sirloin with stout gravy is nothing more than sirloin with some brown cheap pkg gravy poured on top. Gross. Very gross. We asked for churro  smores for dessert  and again...we're told they were out of that dessert.  We won't go back. The food was sub par and not worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Jocelyn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",722,980,376,2.0,10/5/2014,"We were in Enid for an Air Force graduation and decided to do a fancy dinner. So our options were Chili's or Applebee's. We must have been watching too much Talladega Nights and seen too many quesadilla burger commercials on ESPN, however, because we ended up here. Unfortunately this establishment needs a good cleaning. The smell alone is the common old, dated restaurant funk. My friend asked me if it was the smell of feet. It was not our feet. (I'll spare you the details of verification.) Bang for the buck is quite terrible. They charge a lot since this is one of their ""nicer"" establishments in Enid, but the food quality falls into line with that of Hot Pockets and Totino's Pizza Bites. Chips and salsa- I like to eat my grease without feeling like I'm eating my grease, you know?  Either the oil was too old (I'm leaning towards this one) or they were fried at a very low temp and absorbed a lot of grease. Manager was very nice to take them off the ticket and take them back. For lunch many folks got half and half combos with salads, soups, and mac and cheese. No cheese was completely melted on the French onion soup or the cheeseburger.  Can a manager please write back and tell me if all the chicken for salads is pre-cooked or if it is actually cooked fresh? Either ya'll have got a pro using Henckel knives back there, or the strips come pre-cut to the store... I had the cross cut ribs. (Probably all that advertising on ESPN did it... again.) They were confusing to eat. Probably because they are literally... cross cut. I don't expect a smoke flavor from here, but also not enough meat on them to justify the price tag. Fries on the plate were fine. Nothing to complain about nor write home about. Had the broccoli as a side, which actually came out fine! Some people microwave broccoli to hell. Applebee's, however, has mastered the art of microwaving broccoli. I can appreciate that. Server was a genuinely nice person, but service can't make up for bad food and the fact the store needs a good cleaning. If I end up at Enid's, maybe I'll head to Chili's for my next fancy night out?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Jeremiah A.,"Enid, OK",0,47,,3.0,10/30/2016,Only get three stars because the food is ok most of the time there's a few good waitresses there but the management and overall atmosphere an attitude isn't up to Applebee's standards whatsoever,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Nick K.,"Tehachapi, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/14/2016,"No one to greet and sit a party of four. We waited 10 minutes. We sat ourselves. Finally a waitress appears, and takes drink orders and brings our menus. 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. Individually mind you. She leaves. Another 10 minutes she's back to take our orders. 45 minutes later, three of the orders arrive. Cool, but no where near hot. Another 5 minutes the last order arrives, steaming hot. Never say the waitress again. I will never eat at this restaurant again. All this on a very slow Sunday evening. There were 5 guys at the bar, maybe two couples in the place. HORRIBLE SERVICE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Lisa B.,"Enid, OK",15,24,4,2.0,1/9/2016,"The new remodel is nice, the menu looked great. Ordered the sirloin with the Goudy stout gravy off of the pub menu! Just saw it on tv and the entree filled the entire plate! My husband ordered the same thing and his looked totally different from mine -- it came with red potatoes, I think there were like 7 little potato qtrs. My steak tasted like fast food step up restaurant steak. Not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Trevor W.,"Andover, KS",50,17,2,4.0,3/7/2015,"Typically I don't post reviews for restaurant chains like this, they mostly are all the same; mediocre. However, every now and again you get great food with small-town customer service. Despite a family coming in during rush hour on a Saturday we had a great waitress and host. When we got there the waitress was on break so the host say us and gave us our drinks which is not in his job description. The waitress kept the chips and salsa coming! (Three hungry boys!) She was all smiles despite the mess a family of six can make. The chicken and portobellos was awesome. My only grip was the restrooms were horrendous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Jodi D.,"Tuttle, OK",8,13,3,4.0,8/27/2015,"Closes at 12 AM on Wednesday. So their late hours are very convenient. We were greeted promptly and asked where we wanted to sit and that is always nice. Our waitress was very friendly and appropriately attentive. The Cesar salad was awesome. The 9 ounce sirloin steak (MR) was decent, however, since my husband is such an awesome grill master  it's hard for me to find a steak at a restaurant that compares lol. The mashed potatoes were tasty but I did not care for the coleslaw. All in all,  I would recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Garen M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",45,609,4,2.0,7/21/2013,"It's been a long time since I've been to Enid Applebees. Since dining choices are limited in Enid, I try to keep most of my options open so we gave it another try today. Meh, and double Meh. We started off with a dirty table and chairs (at 11am on a Sunday), followed by a round of ""could you please bring us some clean silverware"" that we finally on the 3rd try washed ourselves with drinking water and scrubbed with napkins. We both ordered the Margarita queso chicken and shrimp. After waiting 25 minutes, the food arrived close to room temperature. I'm always a bit frightened to send something back at a chain restaurant in fear that the cook might make a special sauce for my reheated entree, so we went ahead and ate the lukewarm dinner. The food was tasty enough and had a good mixture of spices and grilling, but it's hard to get past the temperature. Our server was friendly and helpful so I gave them a second star. I don't think I'll add them to my list of  ""no return"" Enid eateries - Golden Corral, El Chico or Mazzios, but Applebees ballot has been marked with a couple of ??, ??.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Deborah B.,"Kingfisher, OK",0,3,,1.0,9/8/2016,"This is the 2nd and probably the last time for sometime I will try Applebee's in Enid, Oklahoma. Last night we arrived at the restaurant at 5:45 thinking we would have plenty of time to eat before our concert which started at 7:30. There was no waiting so we were seated immediately. A nice young man came over about 10 minutes later to take our orders. We ordered our iced tea and dinner at the same time thinking it would save time. We finally got our salads which consisted of lettuce, 4 croutons and a tsp of salad dressing and our tea, no utensils. Our waiter said he would go roll some utensils which he did and brought them back to the table. At the same time this manager type person, black, very hateful type lady was seen by us shaking her finger at him obviously scolding him which was uncalled for and not professional. The problem with the food was obviously not his fault but fault lied in the kitchen. At 7:10 I found him with this hateful manager right behind him and explained we did not have any more time to wait or eat and would pay for the salad(?) and the one glass of tea. He says no that would not be necessary. She scowled at us, and started scolding this nice kid again. He explained he was so sorry but the food was coming. I explained we did not have time to eat it even it came out then. We left $10.00 all the while thinking she would apologize but she continued to only stare and glare, didn't say anything to us and continued to  rough up on this waiter. Hello incompetent lady manager! The problem was with your kitchen & YOU, not this wait staff. This same thing happened a few months ago only it was around the 9:00 hour after we had been shopping. We waited on our food that night but we sat that particular night til almost 11:00 with very hungry children. Because this same thing has happened twice now, with no apology from management we won't be back. This woman should adjust her attitude toward her customers and figure out the problem is in the kitchen, not with the wait staff. No reason for the wait staff to be wrapping silverware, it should have already been done. And we should not have still been waiting for food 1 hr and 25 minutes no busier than the restaurant was!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Chad W.,"Edmond, OK",4,99,,2.0,6/8/2014,"It's not so much that I really loathe this place as it is just overpriced and underwhelming. The drinks are more expensive here than places twice as nice, the entire Applebee's chain has mediocre food, and the experience is not particularly consistent. Still, the people are usually pretty decent and there's a few things on the menu that aren't horrible. If you're set on run of the mill chain restaurants or don't want to turn off Garriott/412 for any reason, you could do worse. On the other hand, this town has so many better options that it's hard to not crave something better the entire time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
Lindsay P.,"Enid, OK",1,4,,1.0,11/20/2013,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to! Service and food are terrible..

Buck M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,44,2,4.0,12/22/2014,I ate here the last week in November while visiting. I think something's changed from previous reviews as its no longer filthy and service was decent. I didnt expect much but was surprised at how off previous reviews were. I'm happy an will go back. I lacked a star because too many sauces or foods are preprepared and couldn't remove an item I didn't like. Same issue at outback though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
S S.,"Sumter, SC",115,502,583,2.0,12/9/2008,"BARF!  It's been years since I've had that swirling, horrible, I'm-gonna-die feeling in my stomach.  But, Applebee's brought me right down memory lane.  Eight hours after splitting the two for $20 deal, I found myself hovering over the porcelain god. The worst part is, the food isn't even tasty to begin with.  Now, a bacon burger, chicken fingers basket, and spinach dip isn't exactly gourmet, but I've had MUCH tastier food at just about any fast food restaurant.   Service is consistently friendly.  That seems to be enough to bring people in.  The place is always packed with occasional 10-15 minute waits for a table.  I'll eat here again I'm sure, it just won't be my idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-enid-4
