My friend Cassey H. and I got a table quickly, the server Jess was super friendly and kept us updated on how things were going. (The ice cream machine was being grouchy). We got our food and it was fantastic as usual. Our drinks stayed full and Jess was so helpful.

Frederick A.,"Mesa, AZ",190,2,,1.0,10/20/2017,-Should have taken it as a sign when we were seated that there were at least six dirty tables in our general area. Lovely to look at stacks of dirty dishes. -When our appetizer came we had to ask multiple times for silverware. Maybe because there were so many dirty tables there was no clean forks and knives. -It took some time for our food to arrive and when it did it was not even warm. I guess it was sitting in the window for awhile. We asked the food runner right away for more fries. First attempt. They never came. We told her our issue with the food temperature. No solution given. -It took even more time for our server to come back and check on us. We told her about our issue and asked for more fries. Second request. No response. -The hostess actually came over and checked on us and we told her our issue and asked for more fries. Third time was the charm. The fries finally came after we were all done eating. -Another server came over and spoke to us so we told her what was going on. She gave an excuse that our server had only been with the company for a week. Then why would you give the new server a party of at least 12 sitting by us.  -After speaking with four employees the manager never came over. They just don't care. Any time I've been to a restaurant with an issue a manager is usually right over to offer a solution.  -I guess we didn't want dessert because they never asked. Isn't it their job to upset us? The more they sell the more we tip. Hello? -Complete ruination of my wife's birthday dinner. Totally was not worth the free burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa
Robin G.,"Mesa, AZ",39,59,22,2.0,9/18/2017,"I was taken aback by the lack of service from the two females working the host stand on 9/17 at about 1pm. We walked in, after about 15 seconds of the staff chatting with each other and completely ignoring us standing in front of them, the hostess very abruptly said ""you can just choose a seat in the bar."" Wow, no ""hello"", no ""welcome to Red Robin"", no greeting at ALL - and we didn't WANT to sit in the bar. We were there to eat a meal and wanted to sit at a table in the dining room. There was not a wait and many tables were available. Very lazy, dismissive, unwelcoming and quite frankly, really rude - suggest some intensive guest training with the front of the house staff.  Service at the table (Caleb?) was very good (and welcoming - in contrast to his colleagues manning the podium up front.) Food took quite a while to come out - husband's medium-well requested burger was more like medium-rare. Really like the Tavern Double burger - it's nice to have a more reasonably sized portion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa

Doug B.,"Mesa, AZ",58,301,196,4.0,1/22/2016,"I like Red Robin. The chain has undergone some serious reconfiguration in the past year or two, but they have retained focus on their burgers. They have many of the same burgers they have been serving for years -- I still like the Royal Red, which is like breakfast on a burger (bacon, egg, cheese), and the Whiskey River BBQ burger is a classic. Some burgers have been phased out, but they have added several burgers featuring high-end ingredients: the ""D.G.B."" (for ""Darn Good Burger,""maybe?) features oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun. Fancy! The ""Southern Charm Burger"" even features candied bacon. Yeah, it's worth ordering that one just to get some of that. Believe me! The menu now offers beverage pairings for some of the burgers. Service has been consistently friendly, and the servers always make a special effort with my kids, but things can be a little slow when they are full. They have added new touchscreen devices to the tables. These devices can be used to order appetizers and desserts as well as pay the check at the end of your meal. For $1.99, you can unlock a bunch of games to play while you wait, too. That charge just gets tacked onto your bill at the end.  I would normally give them 4 stars because I like the place, but they get 5 at this location for one reason: My son left his retainers at the table, hidden in a napkin, and we didn't realize it until we were down the road a bit. We called them as soon as we could, but the table had been cleared. They held the trash can aside for us while we drove back and even helped my family go through the nasty trash in an attempt to locate the missing dental appliances. (If you have never had to dig through trash to do this, believe me you don't want to!)  We ended up finding one of the 2 pieces, which saved us the cost of replacing the entire set, and we really appreciate them helping us out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa

And recently I've been quite disappointed with them.  We've patronized a couple different locations and continue to be disappointed with food and terrible service.   However this visit was different.  We were greeted by Alex our server and he made our dining experience the best!  I dined with my 2 kids and I'm a service snob, I admit it!  I've worked in the industry and have high expectations.

There was a bit of a wait, but she went right up to him and stated that she would be having a cheeseburger, fries, and ketchup. When we got seated, he came to our table with exactly that.

Bonnie C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,11,1,2.0,3/26/2017,"Let me start off by saying that the best part of this meal is......LEAVING....... pale COLD fries, so an endless basket of them is no prize.

Camille W.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,30,10,2.0,5/27/2016,"Typical Red Robin, slow service. We sat at our table for at least 10 mins before our waitress came over to get our drink Oder and then our food took 40-45 mins to come out; they were not very busy. All this is pretty much what I expect when I go to any Red Robin, some reason they are always slow.  What was really disgusting was the manager Katie came walking out of the kitchen with a mouth FULL of food pushing out a cart of glasses, wiped her mouth while continuing to chew and then without washing or using hand sanitizer she proceeded to empty the glass rack. If that is what a manger is doing imagine what the cooks/wait staff are doing  Too bad the health inspector wasn't there today bc I'm pretty sure that is a FAIL.

Greg N.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,4,,5.0,3/20/2015,"Two years ago to this exact day, my wife found out she had celiac's disease. I remember it clearly to this day, we had plans to go to Red Robin later that night.  The news was such a blanket-sweep that no one knew how to feel or act. But to me it felt like she had lost just lost something or someone very close.   Later on that night, she was completely against the idea of going out to eat because she was so upset. But after some convincing, she finally was decided to stick to our dinner plans. When we were looking at the menu she just started crying.  The once enjoyable experience that she loved going out to eat with friends or family would no longer be the same. No more ordering what you want, no more relaxing, not worrying if  the food you just ordered might be cross contaminated. It completely ruined the dining experience for my wife and I. Could we ever enjoy going to Red Robin ever again?? This was her favorite restaurant to go to...  I'm here to tell you that Red Robin STILL is her favorite restaurant.... Why???? Because Red Robin is the only restaurant I know that truly appreciates celiac customers. Not only do they offer gluten-free buns, but they have a dedicated fryer in the kitchen Strickley for celiac customers to prevent cross-contamination. For those of you who don't have celiac's disease or know someone who does, this is huge!!!    My wife gets to keep coming to her favorite restaurant and enjoy the dining experience, not having to worry whether or not the fries she is going to eat are going to make her sick for days...  So Red Robin, if you are reading this, my wife and I want thank you very much!!! We will be lifelong customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa

Christine R.,"Mesa, AZ",2,13,1,1.0,2/17/2016,"Never have I wanted to walk out of a restaurant before receiving my food. Never. The waitress was distracted at best, and at one point completely disappeared for over 10 minutes. Meanwhile, 3 servers and a bartender laughed at things on their Facebook apps, etc. The on duty servers were more concerned with those not on shift. We asked for fries to come out soon, and everyone else got their food before us.  There was ONE other set of people here in the bar area.  One. The rest of the restaurant was also fairly dead. It was 7:15pm when we walked in and it took an HOUR to get our food. Our original waitress didn't even serve us! I won't make it a point to come here again.

Abby P.,"Rice, WA",1,22,8,5.0,2/21/2016,"My review is for the quality of their staff, not for the restaurant itself, since I did not eat there on my visit.  I recently purchased gift cards for a school event, but instead of receiving three $10 cards, I received one $30 card, an understandable, albeit frustrating mistake. Unfortunately, restaurant policy is that you cannot purchase a gift card with another gift card, so there was nothing to be done. I ended up rebuying the cards out of pocket.  Regardless: The manager, a friendly, classy man named Drew, provided me with about eight free app/dessert cards for my school in order to try to make up for it, and apologized profusely, while the bartender, a compassionate angel of a woman named Terri who ran around like a whirlwind taking care of orders, felt so badly over my out-of-pocket expense that she comped my malted milkshake.  For no other reason than this uncommon display of friendliness and compassion, I'll be back to this Red Robin, and soon.

A waitress came by and asked if someone has taken our drink order yet, we said no and she said well I guess I will take care of you guys tonight. 5 minutes after she left another waitress came by saying she will help us, we advised that we have already been helped. The food came out good but the service this day was terrible. Every time we asked for something the waitress made us feel like it was a bother.

She sent it back to get one done with 'some pink' as originally ordered and it came back very 'well done' with zero pink. Server was unapologetic and lethargic at best.

At first I thought we were in for a good meal with a good server at the start, but it turned horribly wrong.  We ordered the large stack of onion rings, got the small stack.  My wife had sweet potato fries that were cold and took forever to get her new fries.  The server wasn't gracious at all, and when the fries did come out he just handed them to my wife with no apologies.  He came to say he would refill our drinks and it took a reminder and 15 minutes before we got them.  At the end of the meal he promised boxes for our leftover food, took him 20 minutes to get our boxes.  He made an excuse of getting food for another table, well that is not our problem.

Sarah F.,"Apache Junction, AZ",33,228,46,2.0,7/7/2014,"I have always been a big fan of Red Robin.  I love their burgers and I love their fries.  It's a real bummer that the last few times we've gone for lunch we've  noticed that both the service and the food quality aren't what they once were.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what the problem is, but the burgers and sides just aren't as good (lower quality of ingredients perhaps?  Less fresh maybe?) As far as the service goes our waitress really did try, but they seemed like they were understaffed, and the hostess kept seating people in her section.  At any rate the service was slow and we were ignored most the time.

Phil H.,"New York, NY",5000,3190,11370,3.0,11/14/2011,"Eh, it's a chain restaurant like all the rest. Red Robin is kind of like the bastard stepchild of TGI Friday's and Applebee's. As it sits along a stretch of road here populated by almost every chain restaurant known to man it is kind of unassuming and almost invisible. Still, after dropping in here the other day for a quick dinner it is definitely worth a second look. Yeah, it has all the standard retro pictures, movie/sports posters, and goofy memorabilia hanging on the walls that is the basis of their cheeseball decor. Also has the over cheery waitstaff that you really want to strangle and just wish they would shut up and take your order. The menu has a lot of burger choices along with many other entrees and appetizers to choose from. One thing I noticed right away -  Bottomless fries and root beer floats. Yes, BOTTOMLESS! OMG - that is totally evil. Must. Resist. Must.  Not in a burger mood tonight as I was craving some chicken. Went with the Ensenada Chicken Platter. Two boneless chicken breasts rubbed with a chili seasoning and served with a side of salsa and two dipping sauces -  salsa & creamy lime sauce. Also comes with a salad with tortilla strips in it. Honestly, this was pretty tasty. The chicken was cooked just right and the chili rub tasted good, the salad was fresh, and the sauces were decent.

By the end of the meal only one of the tables had been cleared. It was 10 minutes before Kenya, our server, acknowledged us. We requested fries to be brought out before our food but sadly the request went unmet. You couldn't say it was due to the server being busy because there were 3 servers working the section and only 5 tables occupied. Once the food arrived we requested additional steak fries seeing as how they never arrived before. They came once we finished our meal. Our drinks were never filled and she spilled my drink when she brought the first one. The food was decent but my burger was a mess. I couldn't even keep it in the bun due to all the sauce poured on it. There were 2 managers on duty but it was apparent, due to the condition of the restaurant, they had low standards so there was no point in discussing it. I love the Red Robin on Stapley!

(10/6/14) i started going to RR in 2009 about once a month or more. We arrived about 5:30pm, the place was busy, we sat in the bar. There was a drunk guy watching football yelling loudly at the TV behind the bar, people were glaring at him. This loser had no clue. Normally, we're served in about 12 minutes, the food is very consistent. Today our food was luke warm, the fries about room temperature. I thought about asking to have my plate nuked but I never send food back, never. The wait this time was 22 minutes, which probably explains the cool food.  And did I miss something, when they started serving fries in these round metallic rings did they also stop the endless fries thing? I think a very similar burger would be the Fudd's half pounder. I think next time we'll go to Fudds instead. This visit really soured me on RR. Oh yeah, their seasoning salt now has sugar added.

Erin L.,"Mesa, AZ",56,119,42,1.0,3/25/2016,"Such a disappointment. Bae and I took the kids to dinner at Red Robin on a Friday night. When we first arrived it was fairly busy, but we still got a table rather quickly. The first person to approach the table asked for our drink order. We requested a kids menu first. He copped an attitude and said ""it's the same drinks as the regular menu"". Note that the prices are different since some drinks are included with the cost of the kids meal. We think he was a manager because his polo was different from the rest of the staff. The crowd died down shortly after we got settled in. The meal itself didn't take that long to come but it took a good 15-20 min to get a refill on the drinks and longer to get more fries. The dipping sauces we ordered at the beginning of the meal barely made it out with the fry refill, which could have been dessert as late into the meal as we got them. Thankfully the tables have the machines to pay since we never saw anyone else after the first refill of fries. The dishes were dirty and the soda was watered down, the silverware and napkins were sparse. All in all we will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=40

My hubby said his jalapeno burger was not very tasty as their meat is not high quality. The manager recommended eating the black angus burger, next time. If they are known for burgers, then all of the burger meat should be real high quality and more of it on each burger. The fried jalapenos were soggy on the burger.

Clayton J.,"Apache Junction, AZ",5,20,,5.0,10/22/2014,"Red Robin is generally a good place to get a burger, fries and shake. They have excellent onion rings, which is my favorite appetizer to get. The service is usually really good and the burgers are mighty tasty. I enjoy eating here as does my family. I have never had bad service or a bad burger.  For a chain restaurant they do have great burgers and an excellent selection of them. I like their protein burger and that it comes with a salad instead of fries. Tragically it doesn't come with unlimited salad. I am also a huge fan of their bacon chesseburger. Their Royal red robin is fantastic, but afterwards I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. They still have unlimited fries. It's a more upscale Fuddruckers with better burgers. I've never sat at the bar so I can't comment on that. However, everywhere else is very family friendly. I enjoy when the wait staff gets together to sing a birthday song. It always makes me think of Waiting, hopefully I never get the dreaded THUMBS DOWN at any restaurant I eat at.

We chose to go to Red Robin because of the ""bottomless fries,"" but when the food finally came (After 10 minutes waiting for our server to acknowledge us, and 40 more minutes waiting for our meal to come), the fries were cold. They weren't lukewarm, they were cold. This is after we specifically requested that they bring us the fries before the meal. Our waiter said that their policy is for fries to go with appetizers first and then, if there are any extra, they can offer refills or pre-fills.  By the time I got a decent order of fries, I had literally been in my seat for over an hour. They claim to have bottomless fries, but when the place is busy, fries are so scarce, you're lucky if you get more than a handful with your burger.

Luckily the manager told us his name.  ""J"" took   our drink order.  When he came back we had some questions.  We were wondering if the $4.79 salad price was discounted with an entree item?  ""J"" informed us that we could order a salad as a side & it would be smaller or the bottomless fries would come with our burgers as a side.  Everyone ordered their usual.  I decided to try the new ""Mt. Olympus Burger"" with the garlic mayo on the side.  ""J"" seemed to only have two other tables he was tending to.  ""J"" forgot my son's pickles on the side, we had to remind him a couple of times for extra napkins and we had to ""flag him down"" a few times to fill our iced teas (my husband had a cold).   My husband noticed that they had started to rescue the miners in Chile on one of the t.v.s near the other side of the restaurant.  We were the only people on our side of the place, I asked ""J"" if he could turn the channel so that we could see the news.  ""J"" seemed confused but went to ask the bartender.  ""J"" said that the bartender told him that it wasn't the news but they had just cut in to the soccer game.  (They were both wrong)  We had been straining to watch it the entire time we had been there and it was on half screen since it was LIVE HISTORICAL BREAKING NEWS.  My children had wanted to watch the rescue as well because we had been explaining it to them.  My young son asked why we didn't get to watch what we had asked for?  My husbad told him that the waiter was confussed way back when he started taking our order & we would have to wait until we got home to see it.  I had tried to flag down the manager but he was BUSY.  We noticed how the bartender & the manager stood watching the channel we wanted on the 3 t.v.s by the front/bar.

I really like Red Robin and I know this was just a one-off deal, but it was more than a little off putting on how rude she was. So she forgot our fries, our silverware, let dishes pile up on our table and she was rude about it. lol She's young and I'm sure they'll coach her. RR is still my favorite chain burger joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
Sanford R.,"Bloomingdale, IL",6,349,2,5.0,10/28/2012,Red Robin has awesome burgers for a good deal! I enjoy their unique gourmet burgers and I love the concept of free refills on fries. The service is usually pretty good. I come often because of the reasonable prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
Kyle S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,27,5,2.0,9/26/2014,"I asked for a burger done medium, they brought out the most charred, burnt, disgusting burger I have ever had. Two stars because they didn't make me pay for it. Not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80

Rick G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,4/21/2016,"I've had service issues here in past years and I avoided Red Robin for a while.  After returning a couple of months ago and having a decent experience, I decided to go back again tonight.  The food was decent but the service was horrible.  It took almost 20 minutes before the waitress came to take my order, and I had to walk up to the bar and get my own refill 3 times, after my glass sat empty on the table for 10+ minutes, each time.  Botomless fries are a nice touch, if you can get the waiter/waitress to order them for you.  I waited 15 minutes for a fry refill before she decided to yell into the kitchen for more.  By then I was done with my meal, and didn't want any more fries.  After overhearing my waitress order my fries 15 minutes after I walked to the bar to request more -- I asked her to cancel the order, as I was ready to go.  Very disappointing how little attention the wait staff gives customers.  After a long day of work and paying $20 for a burger, fries, and iced tea, I expected better service, especially since there were only 6 people in the bar area where I was seated.  Very distracted and inattentive wait staff.  If you're looking for a quick bite, and attentive service, I can't recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
Angela L.,"Oakland, CA",132,59,9,3.0,6/4/2011,"I've been here 3 times and ordered 3 different things, and each visit has progressively gotten worse. Visit 1: Clam Chowder Soup - pretty good actually Visit 2: Mushroom Burger with Endless Fries - eh, pretty good, but I've definitely had better and it's pricey. Visit 3: Salmon Burger ($10.81) - I can make a better salmon burger than this. It consisted of whole wheat bun (not grilled, just soft), grilled salmon (that was dry), lettuce, and tomato, with Side Salad (super small salad but the honey mustard dressing was one of the best I've had). I would've given Red Robin 2 stars, but I felt that there was a lot of salmon in my burger, which is rare in salmon sandwich/burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80

Kristy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,14,15,5.0,2/8/2011,"This is my husband's current favorite restaurant.  I enjoy it too, although burgers aren't my favorite thing.  They've got a variety of gourmet burgers to choose from.  Their burgers come with bottomless fries, which is a nice touch.  Their appetizers are really good too.  We usually get full after only a few bites of the burger because of the appetizers and bring the rest home to eat for lunch the next day.   Great food for a small price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
Ricky C.,"Mesa, AZ",42,59,,4.0,4/6/2010,"Well I have been here many times in the past so I know what to expect even before walking through the door. There is the Welcome to Red Robin greeting, followed by the question as to how many are in your party? That is where the similarities end with this half burger chain and half sports bar and most chain restaurants.  Yes there are other chain restaurants with locations scattered in and around the valley that all promise the same hand crafted burger masterpiece, but how many of them offer that delicious burger combined with bottomless fries? They may all offer similar products but ask anyone with any experience with chain style eateries and they will tell you there are always those small yet noticeable differences.  This location is near to the mall which means it is usally populated by middle aged couples, 30 somethings who like a few cocktails with their meal ( watch out for them on the road) , and teens who want to hang with friends and share some really tasty burgers. Their claim to fame is their large selection of burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and drinks. I normally order the mushroom swiss, or a bacon blue cheese burger.  With each juicy bite I can feel my stomach growing and my waist line expanding LOL. Seriously if you want those little dried out frozen patties found at your local drive through then this is not the place for you. Honestly as with BBQ it is important to understand that if you are going to do something make sure you do it right!!! Don't take shortcuts, make sure you use the best ingredients you can afford, and most of all do not call something that it is not!!  It is like saying you want a Philly Cheese steak sandwich and then cooking a package of steakums and placing it on two slices of white bread.  Seriously with about 13 of  what they call their signature burgers, 7 kinds of bread, 7 kinds of cheese, and a toppings list that would make old Mcdonald which they came from his farm this is the place to indulge all your grilled beef fantasies. Just make sure you learn from my experience and wear your large eating pants. Trust me you will need them. Case closed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
Jennifer O.,"Phoenix, AZ",368,1822,73,2.0,12/16/2011,"I went here tonight for dinner with a couple of friends and I must say... it was pretty meh. I don't really understand how this chain got as big as it is because it is overpriced and not very good. Plus the 'kitsch' is kind of annoying, right down to all of fake enthusiasm and the names of menu items. I got the potato soup and salad combo (which costs 9$) and the salad was pretty terrible. It looked like they opened a bag of rabbit salad and dumped it on a plate with some cheese on it. The lettuce tasted like it had not been washed. The soup was mediocre, not bad, but not as good as potato soups I have had at other chain restaurants. Oh...and there was a bug on our table. You heard me. A bug. I don't know what it was....but it was a medium sized bug and was kind of gross and unappetizing. I'm not trying to say the place is dirty, because I'm sure every restaurant has had a bug come in...hard to avoid....but I think the place should be maintained enough to keep them off of the tables at least. Anyway, I feel that my money and calories are best spent elsewhere, sorry RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80

Erin M.,"Seattle, WA",417,596,1806,3.0,6/4/2011,"#1 Zagat rated burger? There's no way! I had the Red Robin Gormet Cheeseburger and thought it was A-OK. I ate 1/2 of the bun and mainly the meat portion since I didn't want to waste the burger. Still can't believe it was $9.78... The burger is pretty average and I don't find anything special about it. Fries are individually bigger, but that does not mean they are tastier. The only thing that is good about the place is their honey mustard sauce. Definitely a place I'd pass on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=80
