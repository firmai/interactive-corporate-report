339,Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,4.0,2012-01-03,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Sunday night a few weeks ago, while visiting his sister and brother-in-law.  Its located in the beautiful and fun Town Center, and was a short and convenient walk from the Westin nearby.  We had called ahead around 5 PM to see if we could make a reservation, which we couldn't, but the woman assured us there wouldn't be a wait if the two of us came around 6:15, and she was true to her word, which was helpful. The space is large and decorated like other Cheesecake Factories.  Our waiter was attentive and fairly prompt.  We love their bread basket, and their extra-large drinks, which mean never needing a refill.  I enjoyed my tomato-basil pizza, and my boyfriend liked his burger.  We split a piece of the chocolate chip cookie dough, which was divine as always.  I'd definitely return here when visiting the area.  It's reliable, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.184,3.76

246,Michael S.,"Norfolk, VA",7,9,,2.0,2012-03-24,"Upon entering, I was really impressed. The atmosphere has an Egyptian museum look. The staff was friendly. My wife and I ordered and that is when the adventure began. 20 to 30 minutes later the food came and my wife's order was the incredible crispy chicken. I myself had the Salisbury steak. When it arrived, it looked good with the garlic mashed potatoes and long green beans.    Now the meat. Well, it was redder than I preferred and after waiting the waitress to come back to check on us (20 minutes) I asked for it to be cooked more thoroughly. So, 15 to 20 minutes later it returns and I am starving at this point. I grab the knife and slice a little bit of heaven and behold.... still red. So, after another 10-15 minutes of trying to flag my waitress, she returns and and sees the poor abused steak still red. I don't have to say a thing. She apologizes and says  this has been a real ""off day"" whispering something about problems they are having with the chef that day or something. Unfortunately, I did not have time for another warm up.    They did make it right but maybe next time they will have their act in order or another chef. However, I could not pass up the opportunity to get a big slice of raspberry lemon cheese cake.  Ohhhh soooo goood!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=320,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.9520000000000004,3.84

I had the Garlic Noodles and it was very tasty, I just wish it had more vegetables and not a whole pound of pasta! My husband had the Steak Dianne with Shrimp Scampi but again, only 3 shrimp, little steaks and two big scoops of mashed potatoes. Everything tasted good but the carb ratio versus protein and vegetables was not right. I also tried the house merlot and thought it was lovely.

294,Justin V.,"Norfolk, VA",234,141,646.0,3.0,2012-08-28,"The Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach actually isn't a bad place to dine. I find it a little surprising, though, that it's constantly busy because it's not a great place - just a good place. TCF is a bit more of a jack-of-all-trades spot, witness to the seemingly endless amount of items on their menu.  I've dined here sparingly since it opened around 2004-2005, but I've had a pleasant experience each time. The service is very friendly and responsive, and that's really all you can ask for with the front of the house. The only qualm I have with the FOH is the wait, but that's because everyone goes here. Dinner service is tricky because there's a guaranteed wait, but I've had brunch where there's no wait at all. In regards to the food, it's decent. TCF goes out of its way to provide something for every type of foodie, so I applaud them on their diverse selection. That goes a long way towards customer loyalty and thus, repeat business. But that approach is a double-edged sword as there isn't an outstanding menu item (except for their cheesecake, of course) on the list. If they dropped a few items from the menu they can make inroads into making the remaining items outstanding, rather than good. But hey, maybe that's what people want. In my opinion, I want outstanding, especially for the prices they're charging. For anyone trying to impress a date or appease out-of-town friends/relatives, this is a go-to spot. It's centrally located, easy to find and there's something on the menu even the pickiest eater may like.  JV",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=220,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.0840000000000005,3.76

333,Amanda R.,"Newport News, VA",109,131,22.0,3.0,2012-09-06,"Came here just for dessert over the weekend. I ordered a slice of the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake, and my date ordered the Oreo Extreme Heart Diabetic Coma Cheesecake (or whatever it's called). We arrived about 45 minutes before closing time on Saturday, and had a server that was definitely feeling the stress of a long shift. He had a very harried demeanor, and his attempts to be friendly came off very cold and abrupt. He plopped down platters of bread and butter and disappeared before introducing himself or even asking if we wanted bread. Once he came back & we told him we were just ordering dessert, I guess he felt bad for not asking, so he started pummeling us with questions about our lives to make up for it... which was odd, since he never stood in one place long enough to receive answers to those questions.  ""You guys aren't hungry?"" *disappears* ""All that cheesecake - want a drink to go with it? Haha!"" *flees* ""So what brings you all in so late?"" *vanishes into thin air* Enough about the server though. The cheesecake was delicious, as usual. If you're a big chocolate lover, go for the Oreo Cavity Making Blood Sugar Skyrocketing slice. It's tasty.

322,Greg F.,"Alexandria, VA",385,577,313.0,2.0,2012-12-03,"I would love to give this place a higher rating, but twice they almost killed my wife, so no more than two stars here. My wife is allergic to cilantro. We make this perfectly clear every time we go in. This last time we even told our server the story. So, we start our meal off the fried dumplings like we always do. They come out on a plate in the sauce this time instead of a cup on the side to dip them in. Okay... clearly some changes were made. Not a big deal right? Wrong. They now put cilantro in the sauce!!!! Although our server was very nice, hello. We just told you a story about this place almost killing her from cilantro and you serve her cilantro. Damn! As soon as I took a bite I immediately told my wife to stop chewing as she was still on her first bite. See, I love the stuff and can taste it clear as day. Luckily, she had an epi pen on her so she stabbed herself in the leg and no death occurred. When we asked for the manager to come over it actually took him a few minutes. Then he stood there with this blank look on his face. This, well you're not dead look. He had no idea how to handle the situation. He comped our meal (packed the order to go while I went and got the car) but charged us for the dessert. To top it off, when we got home lemon cake didn't taste anything like it did before. They made some changes to the menu that sucked. A couple of items they removed I really enjoyed. Then they made changes to existing dishes like mentioned about. My four cheese pasta was terrible.

My meal came first and it had two eggs upside down fried hard, brown, uh, oops.  I pointed the error out to the young lady who brought it from the kitchen (not our server) and she immediately returned it to the kitchen for a correction leaving my english muffin on the table to get cold.  Hubs meal quickly followed and it was delicious.  I picked at it while waiting for my meal, strawberries, pecans, fluffy french toast, yum.   My plate was returned to me with two perfectly poached eggs on top however everything else on the plate, like my english muffins, were no longer hot, luke at best.  The hollandaise sauce was still in the little metal container and it was also cool and congealed.  I mentioned the sauce to our server and he said it's supposed to be like that, room temperature. It wouldn't pour from the container (I did not ask for it 'on the side')!  Seriously?  I pulled some out with my fork and the tong marks remained in it. The eggs were served over crab hash. The crab was sweet and abundant but the potatoes in it were like mini soggy french fries however everything was very well seasoned with three colors of bell peppers.

231,Rick S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,176,45.0,3.0,2013-03-10,"After once again learning the lesson, from a recent stop at Kincaid's, that a chain restaurant can still be pleasant, we again visited The Cheesecake Factory at Town Center this past weekend for lunch.  The facility itself is still impressive --- big, open-air spaces, high ceilings, exotic but tasteful decorations, lots of glass and light, tons of real plants, and upscale tables and booths/chairs for guests. After making our way past the cheesecake and dessert station, which sits immediately adjacent to the front door, we were immediately seated and began the walk through the restaurant's huge and very complete menu (I'm still not used to the advertising contained in their menu, but to each his own...).  Our server Brittany was very chatty and informative, and, since we were in a lite-kinda lunch mood, suggested we try their freshly-made chicken soup, along with several other suggestions.  My wife settled on a grilled chicken and avocado sandwich, which was served with bacon, lettuce and tomato and a creamy sauce (?) on grilled sourdough, along with too-salty but correctly cooked french fries, which she found very good (except for the french fries).  I tried the chicken soup, and combined it with a half-sandwich of chicken salad (with almonds) and a small salad.  I think the chicken soup was the hit of the meal, for both of us --- it turned out to be more of a chicken chowder, and included grilled chicken chunks, huge black mushrooms of some sort, green peas, celery, artichoke hearts and red peppers, all mixed in a creamy, thick chicken broth and seasoned with a little black, and probably cayenne, pepper.  Really superb, and saved the day for me from the underwhelming chicken salad (Brittany said it was home-made, but, if so, they need to fire the pantry chef).  And then came the big test of the meal --- cheesecake, or not?  Even though we'd had plenty to eat, we thought long and hard on this --- after all, it's The Cheesecake Factory, right?  So what if you can buy them at Sam's Club --- you can't buy THAT flavor at Sam's Club!  But then we thought about having a slice of THAT flavor --- for us, the Tiramisu, Key Lime Pie or Dulce de Leche --- and decided that it was gonna be hard to improve on a real slice/bowl of any of those yummy desserts by mixing the flavors with cheesecake and putting it all in a graham cracker crust.  Hard to duplicate the consistency of good Tiramisu when you mix it with cheesecake, we thought.  So we passed on the cheesecake, and felt a little guilty --- like we hadn't kept our end of the bargain, when we came in for lunch. So I think this visit was about like the two or three others we've made here --- a lovely, comfortable restaurant outfitted with tasteful furnishings, combined with average plus service, and average minus food, excluding the cheesecake.  Food-wise, we learn again and again the cardinal rule of dining in chains --- figure out what they do best (in this case, cheesecake), and don't get carried away with the rest of the menu.  Every time we come in we say to ourselves that, even though we can buy the same basic cheesecakes at Sam's, we can't eat it in such opulent surroundings in our own kitchen, and we're just gonna get a piece of cheesecake and a coffee.  And I think we've finally decided that that really is the right course of action for a visit here --- although now maybe we'll think about adding a cup of soup, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=280,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.8600000000000003,3.6000000000000005

226,J A.,"Cambridge, MA",38,66,65.0,2.0,2013-07-25,"So conflicted.  Usually, I think of Cheesecake Factory and I think of the weird chain that has unnecessarily decadent restaurants. The VB location is absurd. High ceilings and fake plaster everywhere. It's just a decorative mess that I ponder about quite often.  Then, there's the menu. It never ends. Ads on one page and the other page 20 possible entrees. Just an estimate, but the eating options must exceed 100. Who needs that? The prices are reflective of portion of food and definitely not quality. You'll have leftovers for two consecutive meals after the one you just had. Not bad! If you like mediocre pasta microwaved.  HOWEVER!! That cheesecake. Almost all of them are wonderful. If it's cheesecake time, I have someone drop me off at the front. I go to the cheesecake section, grab one to go and the night is great.  Another great thing about the CF is the Thai Lettuce Wraps. They have a peanut sauce that is delish.  Can we note how crowded this location gets? It must be its convenient location in Town Center or maybe people want to be seen and going to any restaurant counts as being out on the town.

The family was in town and they had an errand to run down at Pembroke so after we were finished at the mall we walked across the VB Blvd and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. The place was pretty packed for a Saturday afternoon as there were a couple of party's going on. We sat next to one of them however they pretty much done and weren't noisy. There were 5 of us, 3 adults and 2 children and even though they were busy our server was still timely and attentive, checking with us regally and keeping the drinks topped off, etc. Kudo's to her. We started off lunch with an order of Tex Mex Eggrolls. Six of those came in the portion along with sides of guacamole and salsa. These were good but I've had better at other places.  I opted for a Cuban Sandwich for my lunch. My brother had a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese and his wife had a Club Sandwhich. Let me just say the Cuban and Chicken Parmesan sandwiches were big enough to be 2 meals each. The Club sandwich was no slouch either, however it wasn't as big as the other two. This was hands down the best Cuban Sandwich I've had in recent memory. The Cuban included roasted pork, Swiss cheese, Ham, Pickles, Mustard and Mayo on a grilled and pressed Cuban style roll. The kids had kids meals which included a mini chicken sandwich with fries and a quesadilla.  Were we done yet? Sorta. I was Thanksgiving full, however my brother and his son opted to split a gigantic slice of chocolate cake. I sipped on some Cappuccino while I waited for both of them to explode.

I went here on a Saturday afternoon, before a concert at Hampton Coliseum.  Being by myself, I just went directly to the quaint bar, located to the right as you enter.  I liked that each spot at the bar was already set with a very assortment of silverware and cloth napkin.  I ordered a beer and the Chicken Factory Grande Burrito. The burrito, in a word, was simply magnificent.  It was bigger than I expected and quite tasty (that's what she said, lol).  It was stuffed full of chicken, cheeses, peppers and onions with a nice scoop of guac on the side.  How can you go wrong?   The service at the bar was great.  The food was magnificent.  The ambiance of the building is stately.  Eat here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.184,3.3200000000000003

You can get full size mojitos, Long islands, Margaritas, Cosmos, and my ultimate favorite the J.W Pink Lemonade. That's what keeps me coming back. The J.W lemonade is what I look forward to by the end of the workweek, haha. They also have the usually well drinks, wine, and beer on special as well. When you walk in just seat yourself in the bar area and you might have to wave down a server to start taking your order. The only thing I don't like about the Happy hour is that you can't sit outside and enjoy the specials. Bummer on a nice sunny day. But the interior is very upscale and inviting. I recommend getting to happy hour a little bit early (between 4pm and 5pm) since their happy hour is only for 2 hours (4pm-6pm). You need to allow enough time to look over the extensive menu and order as many drinks as you need. Because at 6:00pm on the DOT, you can not order from the Happy Hour menu anymore. Their computers won't even let the servers ring in the specials after 6pm. .  When I say the menu is extensive I mean it! It takes about a good 10 minutes to read the darn thing. My groups favorites are the Nachos, Tex Mex eggrolls, and any of the sliders. The menu definitely has something for everyone in your crowd. You will not be disappointed. 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.54,3.0800000000000005

235,Boyd B.,"Chesapeake, VA",7,3,,2.0,2014-03-20,"I suppose having to wait to be seated on a Wednesday night at 6:30pm is supposed to be a testament to a quality dining experience. However, our party of ten waited for over an hour. Though the waiter was attentive, he very rushed throughout the meal, passing by my raised hand twice to get to the table directly behind me. This may sound trivial, except for the fact that I could turn my chair around and touch that same table. The high ceilings are beautiful, but the ornate decor belies an incredible misuse of space. All in all, this review would have received at least four stars if the food matched the price tag. Our group ordered the nachos, which were superb. I wish I had eaten more of the nachos than the Moroccan Chicken that I ordered as an entre. The chicken was not seasoned and was drastically overcooked. In addition, it didn't even feel like a full meal. No vegetables? Grilled chicken on a bed of couscous left the meal wanting.  To recap: long wait for EVERYTHING, attentive but oblivious waiter, overpriced and poorly prepared meal, an ineffective use of space, and an aesthetically pleasing, yet noisy atmosphere = 2 Stars.

Even if I'm out of town, I'm going to manage to get to a local CF if time permits. My love for the CF started some 12 years ago when I was visiting family in Cali and we were shopping in Macy's at Union Square in San Francisco (if you've read my Macy's reviews, you'll know that Macy's ain't new to me baby) and CF just so happens to be on the freaking rooftop. Personally, I love outdoor dining and any restaurant on the roof with outdoor seating definitely peaks my interest. It was here that I had my first Chicken Madeira and a love affair with CF was born.  Fast forward some years later VB Towne Center was fortunate enough to get a CF!!!!!!!!!! I love this particular location because of the ambiance. Believe it or not, not all CF's have ambiance. They are well outfitted with the finest of marble and waterfallage, recess lighting, leather and shiny fixtures - but some lack that cozy ambiance. I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal here. On the 50+ times I've been to this location, I've only had one bad experience with a server, that was promptly resolved by the manager. I enjoy the Louisiana Chicken and Pasta, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, steak Diane, Orange Chicken, fried shrimp, avocado rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, fried calamari, shrimp and bacon club ANDDDDDDDDDDD the strawberry lemonade amongst other things that I'm sure I left out. I've also had just about every CHEESECAKE on the menu and my favorite is the Peanut Butter Ripple. So darn good.

The menu is rather large and can be a bit much but everything ordered is usually good. The only other complaint I have aside from the wait time is the wait staff.

On street parking everywhere, parking lot parking all filled..they did have parking garages, but I have a fear of those.  When we were approaching there was many people outside waiting and also inside waiting.  To our surprise we were seated right away, table for 2 was instantly seated. We asked to be seated outside, and were put at this cramped little table next to a pillar. The table was fine but barely enough room for two.  Our waitress came up promptly and we ordered something off the drink menu and an appetizer, the fried Mac and cheese balls are amazing!  Eventually she came back with our drinks and we ordered our meals.  However, she never brought us any water.  We were waiting for our appetizer when a girl walks by with what we ordered and asks a different table if they ordered it, if I would not have noticed and spoke up she may have never found our table.  We finished our drinks and there was still no sign of our waitress, a different girl brought us our meals and we ordered drinks from her. The same girl brought the drinks we ordered from her to us as our waitress finally appeared and was in the process of asking if we needed drinks. We had also ordered cheesecake to go through this other girl since we were unsure when we would see our waitress again.  Overall the experience was similar to other cheesecake factories, but the service was under par. If it wasn't for that other girl, we would have probably not ordered another drink or cheesecake.  I don't think we will be back, the food was great as always, between the parking and this being the only one around for miles (I live on the otherwise of the tunnel).  I really hope they open one closer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.1800000000000006,3.6000000000000005

I'm not sure if they were training a new cook or something but everything, and I mean everything we ordered was mediocre at most. We got the calamari app, I had the fish tacos and fries, and my husband had sushi and veggies. Everything was terrible. I had barely touched my plate and the server noticed but didn't offer any sort of replacement nor cut our check down at all. And as for my husbands sushi, it was quite obvious we weren't in an actual sushi bar. We are both big sushi fans, but not for theirs. His veggies were soaked in sauce and were a bit mushy, and my fries were very bland. The calamari was the best part, but still not great.

233,Taylor W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,26,3.0,1.0,2014-08-03,"Gesh. I hate to do such a negative review because I actually did love this establishment but the mediocre service that my husband and I received was unforgivable.  It was a Saturday evening and as usual around this time they are usually swamped with customers. I was told initially that the wait would be 40 minutes. I had no problem waiting because mind you - this is one of my favorite restaurants. We got there at 6:40...time goes by and it approaches 7:40 so something told me to go inside and see what was taking so long, then I was told ""Oh, we have been waiting for you"". I was confused because our devices never vibrated nor lite up. We were finally seated and we were approached and greeted by our waiter. He seemed to be in a rush and took our order for the appetizers + entrees very quickly. Our appetizers came out in a responsible time. Now on to the entrees, when our food came out it was warm, seemed as though it was waiting for a while before a runner came to give us the food. This is not what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Dinner and my husband has the Chicken Madeira which he said tasted like wet chicken. My shrimp was pretty good but - my steak was as hard rocks I kid you not. I was so underwhelmed with everything that night. Our waiter never came to check on my husband and I but strangely enough he was very attentive to everyone else. He would blatantly walk right by our table (seeing that we were out of water) and not even bother to fill up our glasses. I don't know If he thought just because we were a younger couple that we wouldn't tip that well. Let it be known that I tip every well $10-$20 when the service warrants for It. And tonight was a no bueno . So we finished our meal and I asked to speak with the manager, I will say he was very apologetic on the experience that we had and tried his best to fix the situation. He offered some coffee or desert which was nice but if I wanted some desert I could have bought it myself. You know? It wasn't about getting anything complementary It was the principle. And being that I was a regular at this restaurant It really did rub me the wrong way. I don't know if they had a new cook there that night but it was not the best. And definitely not worth the wait.

I could have ate those for dinner and been good. But i ordered the house burrito which has rice, beans, grilled chicken, an assortment of a corn salsa, guac, sour cream etc. I always order it. Its HUGE! And it tastes amazing. Of course i only ate half to save room for Chris' cheesecake....which is actually a brownie cheesecake cake hybrid chocolate monstrocity of epic proportions.  Overall, service was perfect, food was quick and tasted great and dessert was wonderful.  If anyone from management reads this, consider putting a cheesecake sampler on the menu.

Tasted like what you'd get from McDonalds and their mcnuggets are BETTER. My food was good. Enjoyed. The coke was ok. A bit devoid of that fresh coke fizz. It was just ok. Tried ordering another one. Same thing. My hubby's cocktail wasn't strong, not much alcohol so he didn't order another, in fact he said our hotel bars cocktails were better.

The other thing that makes this place great is the ambiance.  It's just a cool restaurant.  Like eating in a cathedral almost.  Massive chandeliers, vaulted cielings, plenty to look at.  It reminds me a little of Union Station.   Now, the drawback, non-adventorous types that are looking for a high-class, middle tier restaurant will flock to here and the PF Changs across the street.  Which is cool, I get it, but be prepared for a lengthy wait.  Well, unless you just want some cake, you can sidle up to the cake ""Bar"" as I call it and order it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=140,3.64,3.51,3.51,3.408,3.5620000000000003

However, everything went great when I ate there last night!  Wait was only 30 minutes, and our waitress was really nice (gave me a straw without hesitating). We order the chicken nachos as an app and it was great. I'm usually iffy about getting nachos anywhere due to my Mexican roots, but their nachos were pretty good and like the fact they cook their own tortilla chips.  For my entree I got the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta- it tasted yum! Was not disappointed. Couldn't finish it so I brought it home. We also got cheesecake to go, and it was good as expected as well.

187,Abbie C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",574,392,624.0,2.0,2014-11-08,"Came here with my big sis to enjoy a night to ourselves sans work and (her) kids. With just the two of us, we thought we would get seated immediately. The guy manning the hostess desk was new so it took a while for us to get situated. No worries... been in that boat before. He was very nice about it and led us to our table personally. Once seated, my sis and I took a look over the menu. There really was no need since we just ordered what we usually get. After a post massage, we were starving and thirsty. Our waitress gave us the famous bread and some mugs of water. I don't really get why she did not give us any straws, but we asked for them and they got delivered to us eventually. Our food was delivered and both of us had made substitutions. I opted the asparagus instead of broccoli. They were some thick stalks of asparagus. Kinda difficult to eat instead of the thin stalks that they serve at other places. Another disappointment was my entrée of Chicken di Pana  as I did not feel like it was served fresh. It was not as crispy as I have had it before so either it sat in the warming tray for too long or was not cooked right is my guess. Still, it was what I wanted and the flavor was at least there. Both my sis and I were done with our meal and chose to have our leftovers be put away in to go containers while we waited on our cheesecake desserts. In the whole time we had been eating dinner - not one time was our water mugs refilled. Annoying since we were trying to stay hydrated post massage... I can get over that, but it took forever to get our check. Once I got home, I was expecting to eat my leftovers come to find out she had mistakenly given me my sister's entrée instead. Definitely had better service in the past. Quite a disappointing visit this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180,3.8,3.51,3.51,3.1440000000000006,3.626
337,Amanda B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,2014-11-09,"Wait Time: Way too long. I went on the weekend, saturday evening. You cant make reservations, they have a first come, first serve policy...which is strange because similar competitor restaurants (BRAVOS or PF CHANGS) allow for them. So a party of 3 around 8 o clock waited 45 min for a booth. Space: Waiting for the table was of course uncomfortable because there is minimal waiting space. This results to a large crowd of people taking up the walk-in space, confusing the seating process, and the pick up area immediately to the right of the entrance. Tip: tell the host that you are in a party of three or four instead of two, even if that is your real number or request a booth only, if you do not do this, they will seat you in an uncomfortably tight position next to a stranger. We witnessed many couples be sat in odd booth/table arrangements that forced them to be sat next to strangers, and we also witnessed half of those people demand to be relocated in a larger space. For those who did stay in the awkward seating for fear of complaining were subject to an uncomfortable dinner because there is no privacy! Food: We possibly did not order the best dishes that the factory has to offer, but being first timers, our server made no recommendation and offered no advice...huge no no. Honestly, we have received better knowledge of the menu and local favorites by servers with lower expectations at chains such as Chilis or Applebees. Anyway, we ordered,and half of us received bland food, while the other half received cold food. So, we waited 45 min to be sat, then an additional 25 min to receive our food...cold and sub par. To make matters worse, one person received his food 5-7 min before the rest of us, his was hot, but once the rest of us were served, our food was not even warm. It was almost comical as if someone was playing a bad trick. While a member in my party requested extra condiments to cure the blandness, I requested my food to be delivered to me hot. The server asked me if i wanted the food reheated or prepared. I told her i was entitled to fresh food. Over All: I then waited an additional 25 min to receive my food correctly without a word from a manager or any decent attempt to make things right. We will never return. If anything this place is overrated. If you ask me, this place is for people who like to feel important, and spend little money. It is not an expensive place by any means but it gives the diner a grandiose type of experience...when they're not slipping and sliding on the greasy floor. Lucky for the factory the appearance of quality attracts people, however the actual quality of my experience will repel me from ever returning. My advice: Save a few extra bucks and go to a place like Applebees, you'll save yourself two hours and the aggravation of a sub-par performance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260,3.68,3.48,3.48,3.108,3.5600000000000005

Yes, I'm absolutely aware that its a chain however the deserved to be graded a high ratings because the food the service here is extremely superb. Cheesecake Factory widely known as the distributor of cheesecakes but its also a restaurant that offers a wide and extensive diverse menu. This particular branch is busy all the time. I suggest to booked your table ahead of time. Don't assume that once you get in you'll immediately be served and seated. My favourite spot to dine in is the outside deck. Family section and bar area is available too. In recent visit, I came here for lunch with friend whom I haven't seen for such quite sometime. I didn't order appetizer because I'm saving it for the dessert so I directly ordered the main course which is herb crusted filet of salmon over mashed potato and asparagus on the side. Thought the fish was cooked to perfection. It was seasoned well and lots of flavor. The mashed potato was soft and creamy and the asparagus was exemplary delectable and crunchy just like the way I want it. As for dessert, I had the red velvet cheesecake. Oh my god, it was moist, smooth and rich.The cream cheese frosting just makes it more even delicious and elevate the texture of the flavor of the cake. Overall, the food presentation was just visually stunning and the flavor profile was simply exquisite.

186,Josh V.,"Chesapeake, VA",51,58,221.0,3.0,2014-11-19,"I have been here 3 times and have not once been impressed.  The atmosphere is definitely nice and the ambiance is very appealing, but if you ever try to go during dinner time, be prepared to wait....a long time! This of course isn't their fault but it is a reality.  It's located in the heart of the Virginia Beach town center and so traffic is always pretty high. They do have a nice bar area and everytime I've been it has been packed. i definitely wouldn't recommend trying to bring the kids with you as seating with high chairs is almost an impossible task, and even longer wait. The service, however has always been fine so that is a bright side of this restaurant. I've never been impressed with the food as it's just been ok.  That might be fine if I'm at a restaurant that has a quicker wait time and cheaper price tag, but this is a place that is more upscale. For the price, the food is comparable to any mid level chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesdays. Portion sizes are good but I feel like the menu is all over the place where they do several things ok, but don't particularly shine in any one area except of course....the cheesecakes! Now thankfully, they do live up to their name.  Their cheesecakes are, for lack of a better word, the bomb! The nice thing too is that you can simply go to the cheesecake service counter and get your cheesecakes to go if you don't really want to eat a meal there. I've had a various assortment of their cheesecakes but my favorite is definitely their toasted marshmallow smore.   It's a hefty price ($7 per slice) but it definitely takes me 2 sittings to finish the slice because it's rich, creamy and my stomach can only handle so much goodness at one time. If you have a group and can agree on the same flavor, the whole pie is a MUCH better value.  The only downside is that all their whole pies are frozen so it takes about 2 hours for it to defrost.  Don't expect to be eating it right away if you're looking for a quick fix. As a restaurant, I will definitely not be dining here.  But as a cheesecake place, it definitely does not disappoint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180,3.6,3.48,3.48,3.404,3.5280000000000005

I didn't want to go somewhere too casual or too formal, and this place was a happy median.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there wasn't a long wait despite the lunch rush. Our waitress was very friendly and was quick with the drink refills.  I initially ordered the white chicken chili with rice, it smelled good but it didnt look as filling as I had hoped. I hate sending door back, but I asked politely, and the waitress was very friendly and nice about it. I then ordered the fried macaroni and cheese burger with fries and ranch, and it was perfection.

238,Stephanie W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",137,294,262.0,2.0,2014-12-28,"I wish I could rate this place on cheesecake alone, because it would be 5 stars for sure. However, I cannot justifiably rate their food with 5 stars. The 4 or 5 times I've been here to eat their food has left me wishing I had gone elsewhere. Maybe their problem is that their menu is too extensive. I think the cooks must have a hard time perfecting anything when they have 100 different items to prepare. (okay 100 may be exaggerating, but seriously). Why not make your menu smaller and focus on the things you do really well? I wish I could tell them what they do really well, but I've not eaten anything that warrants trying it a second time. Even though the meatloaf is on their ""Signature Specialties"" menu, avoid it at all cost. It's dry and flavorless. Don't waste your time on the Factory Grande Burrito either, another ""Signature Specialty"". This was my most recent attempt at enjoying food there. When it got to my table, the inside was cold. I told my waitress and she asked if I wanted them to make a whole new one or just put it back in the oven to warm up. Instead of waiting for a new one, I just asked her to have it put back into the oven. When it came back to me, you could tell it had been left in the oven too long because now my tortilla was hard as a rock. I dissected the burrito and ate the insides, but the majority of my burrito was rice. It barely had any chicken or cheese. I mean, literally, the burrito was 3/4 rice. My husband ordered a Smokehouse BBQ burger cooked medium-well. The burger was well done, and then some. He ate it because he's not one to complain or send things back, but you could tell he was disappointed. I have given up on ever coming here to eat anything other than cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=280,3.56,3.51,3.51,3.208,3.5300000000000002
273,Emily O.,"Virginia Beach, VA",727,86,517.0,5.0,2014-12-29,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory.  Always a solid, non-argumentative ""date night"" go-to.  With your complex menu, poor choice in all-white server attire (I mean, seriously, WHYYYY?!!!), and luxury-casual approach; who wouldn't love you?  Nobody.  That's who. For the longest of long times, I had real issues with you, Oh Cheesecake Factory.  But you, m'dear, have really changed my tune. See, what I've realized about this place is that you must follow one, very simple yet golden rule: FIND WHAT YOU LIKE, GET IT AND GET OUT. Many times I have followed the advice of servers who, while direct and honest are somewhat biased.  Why?  Because they have verrrrrry different tastes buds than I do.  I have tried many things here, including but not limited to:  Factory Meatloaf, Steak Diane, and Chicken Madiera.  None of them fancying my palette. I felt as if, for the longest time, I was constantly being cornered into going here and choosing menu options that were just not for me.  Boring, lackluster foods that left my beady, little heart desiring a fourth meal. That was until I met David.  What a game changer that was. David is a veteran server at Cheesecake Factory that somehow can seamlessly match up your mood/taste buds to the perfect concoction.  He is amazing, splendid, bold, all of the good things that you look for in a server. He matched me up to the Chicken Farfalle but subbed out the chicken for four large, succulent, monstrous shrimp.  Dear lord, it's good.  REAL GOOD. But honestly, what really sent my magic carpet a'riding was the soy-glazed edamame.  It's glorious; simply glorious.  Get it, drown your sorrows in it, propose to it, marry it, have five (beautiful) children with it, and spend your life with it.  It's just THAT good. Make sure you ask for David, your Cheesecake Factory woes will never go unanswered again.  May God bless you on your journey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=160,3.56,3.52,3.52,3.508,3.5360000000000005

After our entrees we couldn't pass up on dessert. My fiancé ordered the red velvet cheesecake and loved it. I am actually not a fan of cheesecake so I ordered the apple crisp and it was great!

275,Jonathan M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,119,38.0,2.0,2015-05-03,"The dinner actually tasted pretty good. Otherwise, not much great about this place.   We arrived a little before 6 and there were a lot of people already waiting in the lobby. There was no sense of organization at the ""hostess"" or check-in table. Lots of people standing around it and it took us a minute to figure out who was in line and not in line. I think part of the problem is just the setup. It's right next to the cheesecake line and everything just kind of blends in to one. And the hostess didn't care enough to create a traffic flow.   I went ahead and grabbed a menu while we were waiting, because we had some place to be. I'm glad I did, because their menu is WAY too vast. Seemingly hundreds of items, and it even had an insert with more, lower calorie, options. Overwhelming. But, while we were waiting, i found something that sounded good.   At about 6:30 we were seated. Standard vibrating pager to notify you. Really can't complain about the time it took to get seated based on the number of people that were there waiting.    I hate the seating. We were put in a section that is basically one long booth on one side with tables every two feet and each table is supposed to seat a pair of people. I understand they are trying to cram as many people as possible into their space, but this was a bit excessive. No sense of privacy or intimacy. Will never go back for a romantic meal again because it can't be done.    Our server took a long time to come to the table and acted shocked when we told her we were already ready to order. My girlfriend ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken w/vegetables. Server warned us that the jambalaya was incredibly spicy and made sure that's what she wanted.    Drinks took another 5 minutes or so to come out. I ordered water and it came in what looked like a mock beer mug with a giant handle. And no straw. Looked around and realized that's just their practice with water is to put it in that mug and not give you a straw. Straws at least give the illusion of a cleaner drinking experience, so I would prefer to have one. But, I don't think this place cares about stuff like that, otherwise they'd have more of an illusion of privacy in the seating too.   The food took FOR. EVER. To come. We didn't get our food for about 40 minutes. The server kept coming back and saying she was going to check on the food and that this was ridiculous, but it wasn't until about the 3rd time she said that that she told us the chicken was the hold up. What?? Ok... Chicken doesn't take 40 minutes to cook.   The food finally came. The ""vegetables"" looked and tasted like food lion canned green beans. I like canned green beans, but not on a 17 dollar plate. The chicken tasted good. The jambalaya wasn't remotely spicy. Granted I have a high threshold for spicy food, but when the server gives you a warning, I expect it to be HOT. My girlfriend does not have a high tolerance for heat, and she ate it no problem.    We didn't see our server again for a while... When we finally did we flagged her over and said we wanted to order a piece of cheesecake and get our check. We were still eating our dinner, so she asked if we had somewhere to be. I suppose that means she was at least somewhat intuitive, but I was really just starting to get impatient.    It took another 20 minutes to get our check. At this point it's about 740 and we have tickets to a show at the sandler center at 8. For some reason the server kept coming back to our section... She would take other tables orders and come over to our table and give a lengthy apology and tell us how bad sheet about how long everything was taking. This happened 3 or 4 times. Finally my girlfriend just said ""you ARE bringing us our check now, right?"" And she finally did. This wasn't just a problem with us, the people on both sides of us (whose dinner we saw intimately since they were 2 feet away) both were staring off into space, already with to go bags, irritated waiting for their check. We also had to remind her about our cheesecake, which we had to get ""to go"" at this point.    Short, sweet, and to the point. Their cheesecake kind of sucks. You do get a very large piece, which is nice, but I wasn't impressed with either of our pieces. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I get it all the time, and this place's cheesecake is incredibly mediocre. Maybe even less than average, which is insane since that's what the place is called. They do have a lot of varieties, which is nice, but they need to taste better.   I had the same impression of this place the last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory, which was about 8 years ago. Way too much to choose from, way too pricy for a chain, food portions are too big (give smaller portions and drop the price!), and the cheesecake is not good.    It'll very likely be another 8 years before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=160,3.64,3.5,3.5,3.4320000000000004,3.5560000000000005

So the cheesecakes I bought for me and my wife, only one could be half off. Boo!  Anyway, I also decided to order some dynamite shrimp since I haven't had dinner yet. What I didn't expect was to wait 30 min for a kid's sized portion of shrimp. I was disappointed that my cheesecakes were bigger than the entire order of shrimp. And I already had my cheesecakes for 15 min, but it was so hot and crowded that my cheesecakes were starting to melt.   The flavor of the sauce for the dynamite shrimp was good, but not enough to rave about it. Also the size of the shrimp was sad. I've had popcorn shrimp from Wal-Mart bigger than the shrimp they used.  I didn't get to eat my cheesecake because it was on the verge of turning to mush, so I had to stick it in the fridge as soon as I got home.  I would've understood if there was a backup on cheesecake orders, but I thought the wait for my food order was ridiculous. I spoke to another customer that ordered food before me, she said she's been waiting over 45 min for 2 entrees and an order of the dynamite shrimp. Our orders came out the same time, but I was seconds away from canceling the order of shrimp and asking for a refund.

The chicken was so tender, and the sauce was nothing like any sauce I'd ever tasted. My second visit, I ordered their Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It was smothered in Cheddar Cheese sauce! I was a bit confused as to why their Mac and Cheese is not a part of their regular side choices, but is a premium side, and you must pay a $4 up charge of you want this to be your side. Although, their Mac and cheese is to die for! You can taste the different variety of cheeses. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is a winner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=220,3.92,3.64,3.64,3.3480000000000003,3.7520000000000002

The food at best us mediocre. I was disappointed that for the ambiance they try to create, and the hype behind the name and the restaurant itself that I got the same boring food I could just about at any other chain for a lot less. I had pasta which I felt was just a large portion size with no thought process at all behind it on how to actually make it different. I understand that the place is a chain, but I really wanted the place to surprise me. I will say that the cheesecake is good.

116,Ban Ana C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,20,24.0,3.0,2015-09-24,"Usually I would just order cheesecakes because they are really good. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is very rich, and it's not sweet like other cheesecakes, a little bitter, which is perfect for a dark chocolate fan like me. The Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake is rich too. It has a good balance between coffee and chocolate. Those cheesecake are HUGE and rich, and it's not cheap, so I recommend you to share with someone.  This time my mom and I wanted to try their food so we ordered a Shrimp With Angel Hair and Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi. We've waited for 15-20 minutes for the food maybe it was because the other day was a holiday so the restaurant was full of people, which I was ok with it. Also, they provided us free breads with butter while we waiting.  Anyways, the Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi is 4/5. The steak was cooked as what we asked for (medium-ware); the shrimps are big; I assume the mashed potato is made with fresh potato since there are some skins with it; the sauce on the shrimp is creamy and it was good. Now the Shrimp With Angel Hair. It's 1/5. I have never paid $17 for such a simple dish. It's dry and no taste at all. The tomato sauce looked AND tasted like canned diced tomatoes, and it doesn't even have sauce. Even the waiter added some cheese on the top, It's still no taste. The angle hair was too dry that I have to use a knife to separate them. Also, it's warm when it came to our table, so it actually turned cold while we were eating it. Honestly I can cook something better that this crap lol. Overall, I recommend the cheesecake and the ambience of the store but not the food.

Girlfriend had the Kobe burger and couldn't even taste the meat for all the sauce they slathered on it. I had Farfalle pasta. Barely any chicken in it, it was all covered in a very bland sauce which was vaguely garlic flavored but had zero salt and, thus, was essentially flavorless.  We also had the egg roll sampler at the start. It was good, except for the avocado egg roll, which was literally 100% avocado. I thought it would have something else in it as well, my mistake I suppose. The cheesecake was good, however. I'd probably have flipped the table over by that point if it was like everything else. For the price, you can do much better. I've honestly had better food at fast food places. Might have been an off night for them, I don't know. This was my first and last visit to Cheesecake Factory. Walking in, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a menu of Mexican, Italian, and American dishes which seemed like a mess to me.

I just love their ambiance and openness of the establishment. There's never a time during the various hours I've been that there wasn't a wait or a gaggle of people waiting in the lobby for a table. Never. This time was no different. Although it was just me and my boyfriend, the host told us it was a 10 minute wait (wait, what?!) but we opted to sit at the bar where it was fairly empty with only a few other patrons enjoying the last of their brunch. Brunch is until 2 PM and it was 2:10 so sadly we just missed it!  Not to be disappointed we perused through their vast menu and decide to try a Mediterranean salad, their Hibachi steak and mashed potatoes, and their Chicken and Biscuit. My boyfriend is not a big foodie and he mainly eats to survive. Me? I eat for sport. It was my first time ever hearing him make a sound after taking his first bite. He was super impressed and dare I say it, practically in LOVE with his hibachi steak. I giggle when he let me try it. It was definitely tender but the marinate was something so similar and familiar to what we Asians use for our ""barbecue.""  I told him to enjoy it and that I will make him the same dish again soon. My chicken and biscuit was served with mashed potatoes and I was a happy bunny. It hit the spot and was so comforting. One thing I realized when we left was that I didn't have their signature Strawberry Lemonade this time. Kinda made me sad but a quick zip to the nearest Starbucks drive thru made up for it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=140,3.96,3.7,3.7,3.152,3.8040000000000003

Whether you want something kind of Asian to something steak. The staff is nice and lots of care seems to be taken to make sure the customer is happy. I hit this place up on a Sunday, last week, after a Symphonicity concert at the Sandler Center, with my Mom. We had a nice date night. I don't remember our server's name, but he had a huge section of the bar to serve and did a really nice job. He was funny and got us everything we wanted. Our only issue was getting sweet tea, instead of un-sweet. I really appreciated him being upbeat and friendly to my Mom (who is frumpy, and doesn't get out much to engage strangers). Their food can be called a little expensive, but it's really good, and you totally have two servings of food there. We were both able to take home half of the meal and save it for another. Definitely worth it, to me. I ate the orange chicken, since I don't like the snow peas medley that comes with it, the broccoli is a delicious substitute that isn't covered in the sweet glaze. The chicken was breaded a bit heavily, but tasted amazing, and there is a ton of it! My mom ordered a chicken and biscuits dish that was like a pot-less pot-pie. She loved it. I tried it... tastes like pot-pie to me, but if she liked it, that's all that matters. Dessert was some cheesecake that they showed on the big ass TV screen. You can see those things from across the restaurant.

307,Charles C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,,2.0,2015-12-23,"Go here about once or twice a year with the family for special occasions. Not a cheap place to go for dinner but the servings were always large and the food prettu good. Went more for the atmosphere and ambiance than anything else. Went tonight and tried the Chicken Madeira which was my first time. The chicken tasted good and was moist, however, for 17-18 bucks I expected a lot more on the plate. The potatoes were okay but slightly undercooked and not mashed enough. Medium sized chunks of potatoes were in there, maybe because it was too tough to mash. My mom got the chicken di raza? It was a parmesan chicken than came out really dry, but her potatoes came out well done. Sister got the avocado chicken sandwich and that was stellar and excellent according to her. My brother got the orange chicken which is what he always goes for, and I must say he would usually share some, but barely had enough on the plate to share. The same plate would come heaping full at other times, this time it was barely a full plate. We usually pass food around and enjoy the time together, but this time it wasn't as enjoyable due to the okay to blah food for the most part. He did say it seemed like they used too much soy sauce on his orange chicken and when I tasted it, it seemed wayyy too salty. And it was white rice he asked for, so that should have tamed it down a bit too, but it was too strong. The cheesecake as always was the best part, and the pumpernickel bread. I got bored half way through my meal and went back to the bread. Considering we spent well over a hundred bucks here, will probably not come back here again. It's usually a great place for a family meal, but the portions have gotten significantly smaller, the prices stayed the same, and the food much lower in quality. Will try some more of the local places next time around and spend less money and probably be more authentic. Give it two stars for the decor and lighting, it's beautiful inside. I must say though, the constant clattering of plates and other things in the kitchen can be heard while eating, management may want to consider putting a wall up or atleast a sound partition. Felt like someone broke plates almost every 5 minutes. Our waitress was extremely cool, came around and filled up our drinks when we needed, and was very attentive but not overbearing.

It was super inconvenient and unprofessional. So she brought out a big plate of food we asked to have to go, and a tiny box for us to put it in. At this point I was furious and ready to go.

With not a lot of extra space inside due to the large crowd, we waited outside.  I don't know if you recall this particular saturday (just think January winter in Virginia) but it was freezing. After the FIRST hour my friend and I were too cold and hungry to wait outside any longer. We rushed in to feel the warm air wash over our mostly numb bodies and scrambled up to the hostest. Now I was once a hostest and understand the job often sucks, but seriously she had so much attitude and it was absolutely unnecessary.  We asked how much longer our wait was and gave her our name, she scrolled through her computer and found us saying "" you were quoted an hour and a half-forty five minutes, and it's only been..... an hour. You still have to wait"" she wasn't in the least bit polite. I wish I had taken down her name.  So, upset and not ready to go back outside we got in line for cheesecake to have something to hold us over. I got a slice of snickers cheesecake and my friend got a banana, since the man was kind enough to understand my friends lack of appeal towards sugar and allowed him to buy a banana. The line was non existent, but it made it evident that the majority of the crowd was waiting for their ""to-go"" cheesecake as we ended up waiting another 5-10 minutes for it to come out.  Once we got it we dragged ourselves back ourside to the rest of our group informing them of the rudeness from the hostess and showing them the spoils of our journey to the inside. We encouraged our party of seven to go inside to wait hoping the crowded presence would encourage others to eat faster and leave.  Finally our name was called (another forty five minutes later and a second chat with the hostest with the mostest) and were ushered to stand to the side of the host stand. We waited another few minutes for someone to seat us and once arriving at our table the experience was fantastic. Our server apologized for the wait and said all Saturdays are very busy and she brought us bread. Lots of bread. Everyone who ordered the beverages of the alcohol type seemed pleased and we all ordered quickly as we were tired of waiting.  The food came out pretty fast for our semi large group and it all came out pretty close in time to each other even due to the broad assortment of food that was ordered. It was all delicious. At the end, we had been there for a solid four hours. That's right, all other evening plans were spoiled. Why did you stay?  You may be thinking to yourself. Trust me, I tried to convince every one to leave, but their determination prevailed me.

My friends and I tend to come here for lunch. Yesterday I got the Chinese Chicken Salad (lunch portion) however even the lunch portion was pretty big. My friend got the Louisiana Chicken which is the best!!! and the other friend got some gumbo which was just ok.   Of course, the best thing about waiting is Cheesecake Factory's bread, especially the pumpernickle bread and the butter they serve, i forget what brand, it's awesome! I have always liked the way Cheesecake Factory was designed, it's always felt spacious there, the designs are so abstract.

I am extremely disappointed in the service that I experienced on Thursday, March 17, 2016 at this location.  My son had just gotten married and decided to have the wedding lunch here. When we (3 in our party) entered the restaurant we were directed to our tables. Our waitress took our drink orders. Twenty minutes later the rest of the party joined us. A total of 14 to the party graced our section. Ten minutes later the waitress took their drink orders. An 1-1/2 hours has passed since entering the restaurant and my food order has not been taken. Finally, two waitresses started taking food orders. I was the first to order a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries (that is no typo, the name is correct). The people who came in after us, ""the first 3,"" got their orders within 20 minutes. I am still awaiting my food. Everyone was served and still no food for me. The waitress came and brought me my fries and said, ""Here are the fries, sorry for the delay, but at least you have something to eat on until your burger comes up."" A total of 2 hours 10 minutes, my burger arrives. The waitress said, ""You're a saint."" I asked the waitress for a carry-out tray to take it with me, because everyone else was just about finished with their food. I was so upset and irritated that I didn't want to eat when the food finally arrived. Mind you, the restaurant was not crowded for that time of day. I literally walked the restaurant to see just how crowded it was. The rest of the wedding party made comments about how I ordered first and got mine after theirs.

266,Yuniel D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",40,4,,2.0,2016-04-20,"Let me start by saying that my first experience at this Cheesecake Factory was about a year ago when I took my wife for our anniversary.  Never cared much for going to this place, but she wanted to go, so there we went.  After an hour of waiting, not having my sweet tea glass filled even once, and my dinner getting cold while waiting for my wife's food, that never arrived, and the waitresses walking by as if we were not there, I finally had to complain.  Without saying a word back to me, the waitress walked away and showed up with the manager, who was extremely apologetic for the ""misunderstanding"" on their behalf.  Offered to pay for our food (like I was going to pay for it after all that), and gave it to us in a box to take home with us anyways. Fast-forward a little over a year, my daughter received a very distinguished award in school, and against by better judgment I listened to her and took her to dinner here to celebrate for her great accomplishment.  It was Tuesday evening, so I figured how bad could it be?  The waitress was extremely nice and attentive, and provided great customer service.  The place was not that packed, and the appetizer came fairly fast.  However, like my first visit the main course took nearly an hour before the food showed up.  My meal?  A club sandwich.  It's not like I was asking for anything extraordinary, and neither did my daughter and wife. The food was good, but I would rate it ""average"" at best, certainly not worth the wait. So, needless to say, I will not be returning to this place.  As a matter of the fact, I think after this experience it will be extremely difficult for me to ever want to visit another Cheesecake Factory again.  I am a super patient man (sometimes too patient), but my business has to be appreciated with good customer service and some type of timeliness.  I don't care to pay for good food, but not at the expense of an hour wait on ""average"" food.

I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was for my Sister's 25th Birthday. I had asked her where she would like to go for her birthday and she said Cheesecake Factory as one of her choices, so my family surprised her by taking her there for dinner.

Birthday Girl ordered first of course, and ordered Hibachi Steak with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes (was pretty good, but I don't like medium steaks *womp*) My dad wanted any fish dish, so he ordered the Thai Salmon with Brown rice. He said it was okay but not the best. Then my mom ordered the Orange Chicken with white rice, she wasn't that impressed either.

155,Christina N.,"Chesapeake, VA",133,11,8.0,4.0,2016-06-11,I typically have very nice experiences at the Cheesecake Factory chain. The menu has a wide selection so everyone should find something they like. The staff is well dressed and the decor is classic.  I went last night to this location and our waitress did not pay much attention to us. She walked by our table numerous times without checking on us and took awhile to get us waters and refills throughout the meal. We went early on a Friday night for dinner. There were a lot CF staff and a lot of open tables so I was confused as to why everything took long and we weren't payed attention to.  I will still come back because of the many times that we have enjoyed our visit. Love the food and dessert. I usually get the pasta with shrimp and sausage or the factory burrito grande and for dessert I love the Oreo cheesecake,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100,3.16,3.56,3.56,2.9600000000000004,3.400000000000001

We all ordered the lunch specials pasta, pasta, pasta and salmon. Boy they definitely aren't skimpy on the entree. I can only imagine the dinner sizes (jeez). My mom had the salmon and she really didn't like it, she said it tasted old not fresh, overbooked and hard. She had me taste it and she was right. I had better salmon and not their specialty, steamed broccoli was cooked to perfection, but asparagus was also overcooked. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which I hardly do, but it was tasty our waitress recommendation.  It was very tasty as she said it would, but I couldn't eat the meatballs since I'm allergic and it had Italian sausage mixed into it. So she offered to get me grilled chicken in replacement of it. That was reality sweet of her, but the chicken did not have any flavors on them. So I just took it home so I can at least alter it to my taste. (Lol). Both my girls had pasta as well. They ended up not finishing it either. We also tried the flavored lemonades which was very good, I had the Hibiscus lemonade and my mother had the Cucumbers and Mint lemonade very tasty.

Amanda H our waitress didnt just give us outstanding service she provided us with an experience, a Christmas memory that will last a lifetime. My husband and myself both ordered a Bacon-Bacon burger.(his medium rare mine well done.) They both come out phenomenal loaded with just the perfect amount of bacon and melted cheese. I love macaroni and cheese more than anything, hands down that was the best. It was cooked al dente loaded with creamy cheese and baked to perfection. Props to the kitchen staff for that thanks guys/girls. I didn't have to want for anything Amanda H was right there with everything I needed, whether it was getting me a refill or answering questions about the menu.

Once we were finally seated, our server was very prompt and getting our drinks out to us. So, I'll cut to the chase on that major highlights of the dinner: 1. It took our food way to long to come out. For a party of 3, a nearly 45 minute wait for food is just unacceptable. Our server blamed the untimeliness on the fact of a big party being present. It's 2016, kitchens should be able to work around that.  2. My mother ordered the chicken medeira, and her food was lukewarm/cold. She had to request more asparagus as what came with her meal was simply cold. As far as taste goes, her food tasted ok. My aunt ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which she allowed me to sample. It lacked that flavor, and punch you'd expect to find in a jambalaya pasta.  It wasn't the worse I've ever had but it certainly could have been better. However, it was chocked full of shrimp, chicken, and sausage, and was definitely a great portion size. Lastly, I ordered the chicken teriyaki. It came with a pineapple salsa and grilled banana. My food came out excellent, a personal rating of 4 stars. The chicken was charbroiled and glazed with the teriyaki sauce and it tasted great. I was left very full and satisfied. 3. Everyone's silverware was dirty. I'm not sure if the dishwasher had took the night off, or was rushing to get silverware out. But there should never be food particles on silverware.  Overall, this was not the best dining experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory, by my personal meal did make it ok. *As a tip, this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the 757.

But I find their food doesn't ever measure up to my expectations. I ordered the Chicken Di Pana and was so let down. There was next to NO sauce on the chicken which left it overly dry. I actually couldn't even eat more than a few bites because it was just that unappetizing to me. The broccoli was unflavorful and about the only thing I liked was the mashed potatoes which I originally planned on skipping eating because...well...carbs and me don't get along these days. I brought the chicken home for my dog. He liked it much more than I. I also ordered a piece of tiramisu cake which I did enjoy. Lots of red sangria flowed through my glass but it felt like it was mostly fruit and ice so even after three- no buzz. Boo. I arranged a DD for this very occasion...

We are so lucky to have one here. It's a major asset to the area and gives us a leg up toward Metropolitan. We dined for dinner on a Monday night 2/6/17. Ordered two appetizers. The buffalo blast which is a meal and 1/2. Shredded  buffalo chicken wrapped in a crispy breaded wanton style exterior that you can dip in their no-kidding blue cheese (chunks of blue cheese and a little sauce awesome) or buffalo sauce. Arrives piping hot, crispy. Tonight, it was overly salty. Still a winner. The second appetizer/dinner was the avocado eggrolls. Oh My. These are to die for...perfectly ripe chucks of avocado and sundried tomatoes tucked in egg rolls served with a sweet yet tangy cilantro honey dip. I can eat these until I pop. Utterly addicting. A MUST TRY if you love avocado like I do. We typically opt for appetizers and skip entrees as we needed to save room for the grande finale: cheesecake! Tiramisu and Hazelnut were our choices this evening. My husband declared he we leaving me for the hazelnut cheesecake then proceeded to have his eyes roll back into his head and said not another utterance until he had licked that plate errrrr ummmm I mean...until he gracefully finished every last bite. A good time around with good food every time. **Prices have slowly and readily crept up over the years as expected.

I just think at the very least if the meals are not going to come out together bring the kids meals out first.  The chicken and waffles sounded delicious but it was lacking in all aspects. The chicken was nothing more than fried chicken strips that come pre-frozen out of a bag. I don't even think I'd order these off the kids meal for my children. The poached eggs were overcooked and the waffles were very soggy. The potatoes that came with it had no flavor. I'm very disappointed all around with both of these meals (the adults ordered).

Compared to an actual Thai restaurant though, it's not as good. My fiancé got the skinnylicious tacos and it was good nothing special though. Inside is very pretty with an Italian theme, pretty consistent with a restaurant in Town Center.

There's something for everyone on the menu, including vegan options. They also have an additional menu for those dieting, called the skinnylicious menu if I recall correctly.

Our drinks were always full and we felt very taken care of. We ordered an appetizer each, because their appetizers are the absolute best. My boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese balls, and I got the avocado egg rolls. So delicious! Oddly, about 10 minutes after the mac and cheese balls came out, the avocado egg rolls came out with another order of mac and cheese... apparently our apps got mixed up with the table next to ours. We got a fettuccini alfredo with shrimp to split and it was amazing! The pasta tasted SO fresh, the sauce was great, and the portion was huge, as always. I think the shrimp could have been cooked less but it was still really good. And of course, we ordered dessert, but we were so stuffed we took it to go. I chose the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was the perfect combination of sweet and tart, and my boyfriend who isn't a cheesecake fan, ordered the chocolate cake, which had 6 layers of cake and 7 layers of the best frosting I've ever stolen a spoonful of.

46,Marie R.,"Chesapeake, VA",26,269,202.0,3.0,2017-04-14,"Unfortunately I have to downgrade my previous rating.  We ate here last night--my husband and I.  A lot of the menu items have been taken off.  They have added a few new items, but overall the menu doesn't seem exciting anymore.  Additionally, the service last night left a lot to be desired.  Our appetizers And Entree came out at the same time, and if you have ever sat stone of those two seater tables, there simply is no room for two appetizers, two entrees, two bread baskets, a plate of butter, a separate plate for lemons and two bread plates.  Needless to say, it was a little annoying.  Appetizers should come out BEFORE the entree and not with the entree.  We were clearly annoyed but we didn't say anything.  I think because of that, our waitress ignored us (maybe afraid to see that we were annoyed?  I don't know.). She went to other tables in the vicinity and checked up on those tables multiple times but did not stop by to check on us until we were done eating--probably about 20-25 mins later.  To her credit, she was very nice and never rude, but all around that was pretty crappy service that we received.  Since my last review, I have been to Cheesecake Factory multiple times.  Unfortunately I have observed a noticeable decline in service and consistency with the entrees. Due to the lackluster menu, high price and crappy service, it will be a LONG time until we dine at the Cheesecake Factory again.  There are simply too many good restaurants out there to spend good money and not waste it on a dismal experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=40,3.68,3.27,3.476,3.0840000000000005,3.434

152,Raul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,31.0,2.0,2017-06-04,"This Cheesecake Factory was a disappointment.  My wife and I, along with our 3 kids, came here to meet up with her sister and her family (husband and 2 kids).  First, it took an hour and 10 minutes to seat us, luckily we had to wait for my sister-in-law and her family to arrive, so we waited. Secondly, if we hadn't asked for our free bread, I don't think the waitress would've brought any.  Third, I think their menu is too busy.  There is absolutely too much going on in their menus that had me overwhelmed about what I wanted. Fourth thing, they got my sister-in-law's drink wrong twice.  She eventually just drank the second drink but didn't finish it.  Fifth thing, in my daughter's alfredo dish, she found two long strands of dark hair.  She got a new dish but they still charged us for it. Sixth thing, my wife and I ordered two completely different drinks and for some odd reason they both came tasting EXACTLY alike.  She had the mango mix drink (I forgot the actual name) and I had a tropical mango drink.  Granted they both had mango in it, but I don't think they should've tasted the same.  I think the tropical one should've had a pineapple or coconut type of flavor in it.  Lastly, the bill came out to $102 for 5 dishes, 2 chocolate milks, a soda, and two non-alcoholic drinks.  A bit steep, even for a chain restaurant that has mediocre decor and prides itself on their cheesecake (which we didn't eat because we were so bummed at our entire experience) and ""experience"".  You want some real cheesecake, go to Brooklyn, NYC and have a slice at Juniors ... at least there your bill won't be over $100.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100,3.76,3.39,3.508,2.9840000000000004,3.5380000000000003

Which is the one that they were waiting on to bring us everyone else's plates. I ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach and bacon. The hollandaise sauce on top was not runny instead clumpy and cold. I have been here multiple times and never has my food came out like this. There were 5 of us who sent our food back because it was freezing cold. We then waited another 30 minutes for our new plates to come out it's now 1:55pm and we still not have eaten. 3 out of the 5 who received their new plates were still cold. I don't know if the cooks in the back were playing some sort of sick joke on us but freezing cold eggs are DISGUSTING!!! They also gypped us on the amount of breakfast potatoes that were on our new plates. And one person only got one egg on their chicken and waffles Benedict.

They add slivered almonds to it which adds a nice crunch. The fries are perfect and I always order mine with a side of their very delicious ranch sauce. My daughter had a generous side salad and a pasta dish with a pink sauce. I believe it was called four cheese pasta. D Lish! Again their portion sizes are so large that not only were we able to take leftovers home for dinner that night but there was no room left for cheesecake. That may be a fly in your business model ointment Cheesesteak Factory. I know their portions are so large that I actually brought a cooler with ice for my leftovers.

If you are in search of a chef created meal that has layers of taste and flavor just get your cheesecake to go and dine elsewhere.  The biggest tip off should be the fact that there are literally 100 or more items in the extensive menu. There are Italian pasta dishes, Mexican inspired, Thai etc. how can any one kitchen possibly create so many dishes? By precooking items like chicken which is used in many recipes leaving the chicken dried out and flavorless. One member of our group order thin spaghetti with Mariana from the special summer menu.

We ordered ribeye cooked medium with veggies and shrimp tacos. Food came relatively quickly but I wondered what happened to the bread they always serve. I was told that they don't do it outside unless requested. It took me by surprise because we were there couple times before outside as well and we had bread offered . So right there I knew our waiter had big imagination. He brought bread after all after our food was already on the table. So here comes the fun part. The steak came out well done. Literally no pink whatsoever. We sent it back and after waiting some time the new one  arrived ... well done as well. At that time the manager came by and she looked at the steak and agreed that it was well done . But because we didn't want to wait longer we kept it this time.  My shrimps in tacos were over cooked but not too bad so I kept my food.  So in the end we payed 30 dollars for steak cooked not to our liking ... manager didn't do anything with our check. And the biggest kick was when our waiter told us that our medium is not what they consider  medium. So pink inside considered everywhere as medium is not their medium...  so there you have it.  Not going there anymore. Not worth to waste time on crappy food and service.

Their food offerings don't appeal to me and the quality is just okay, especially for their prices. This location is a prime location right in Town Center off of Central Park ave. I would recommend parking in one of the decks and walking over.  Since I had a gift card we decided to come here. Came here in a group of four with two of our out of town friends and we wanted to go somewhere that had an extensive dessert selection; it's almost two pages and had about maybe 30-40 plus different options for cheesecakes, shakes, and a few baked goods. We came on a Sunday night around 9PM and this place was PACKED. Apparently this location is always this busy and it caught me off guard. Luckily we were able to score a table with no wait.  The lighting is very dim which I wasn't a huge fan of, especially since our table didn't have a candle either. Our waitress was absolutely fantastic; she was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable of the menu. She even (jokingly) said I could go with her into the fridge where they kept all the cheesecakes! I got some sort of mango key lime cheesecake that had a macaroon crust.

11,Tess Y.,"San Diego, CA",44,37,129.0,4.0,2017-07-20,"Their food are usually good or satisfying. The ambience is franchise fancy. You could go in casual or dress up for special occasions. But when it's for dinner esp on weekend, maybe dress a bit nicer than plain t-shirt, but overall nobody really cares.  I love the convenience of take out order cheesecake.  Their cheesecakes are unmistakably the best cheesecake I have tasted so far (I know it's franchise, to me it's still the best). Almost tried all their flavors in the menu. It's satisfying when you're craving for cheesecakes, might have to pay more but it is worth it if you are craving for sweets and already see yourself heading down the path of sweet indulgence accompanied by consuming tons of calories. In situations like this, you might as well eat the good ones as it is worth it.  Advice: Due to different flavors, If some that may be too sweet for the taste, Usually taking little bites at a time with milk helps. Never gobble a cheesecake. I used to eat the ones they sell as a platter at the grocery stores. Ever since I have been eating Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes, I don't eat the grocery ones anymore. I also tried a few bakeshop and other fancy restaurant cheesecakes so far Cheesecake factory is still the best place to go. Not that I'm being snob, but I try to choose and eat my calories wisely.

The food was good but not great. We had the edamame app and the fries mac and cheese to start. The edamame is sprinkled with sugar instead of salt. It was weird and we couldn't decide if we liked it or not. The mac and cheese balls were delish.  For the main meal I had the shrimp summer rolls and they were really good but everyone else got pasta dishes and weren't really impressed with them. The pasta was super starchy and it stuck together in big noodle globs.  The cheesecake was on point. It might be my imagination but the pieces looked bigger than usual? We ended up being there for 3 hours. Mostly because we were taking our time. Our server, Matt, was amazing and patient and got more than a 50% tip because I know how annoying it is when you have a party that lingers.  We only make it out to Cheesecake Factory once a year.

I wish they had more lunch size choices and more than one soup a day, though. With a menu that size, you'd think they would do more than one soup choice.  I ordered the bacon bacon burger with a side salad (blue cheese dressing, of course!).  My companions had a chicken pasta Alfredo dish, a regular burger and one of the salads (wish I could remember the name - it was beautiful!). My burger was cooked perfectly mid-rare, as ordered, as was my compainion's. I loved the two different types of bacon on top. The salad (while small - mostly just greens and a tomato) was tossed in the dressing. It was a very nice blue cheese. I would order it on the side next time.

We were NOT disappointed. It was a Tuesday night around 6pm, and we were immediately seated when we walked in. There's usually a long wait, so this was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the Chicken Taquitos appetizer and were not let down. From the presentation on the plate to the taste, they were a hit with us. They were crunchy, yet soft on the inside. The green sauce drizzled over the top made for a unique spin on your regular taquito. For my entrée, I ordered the Orange Chicken with Brown Rice and Mixed Vegetables. You can choose white or brown rice, and I definitely should have chosen white. The brown was a bit dry and wasn't cooked too well in my opinion. The chicken was AMAZING. The orange was not overpowering, and the white meat chicken was very tender with a light crunch on the outside. The vegetables consisted of sugar snap peas and small strings of carrot (?), which proved to be less of a side and more of a small treat. We finished up our night with the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake to share (which we barely ate half of since we were so stuffed from our entrées). It tasted amazing! I highly recommend giving it a try. The melted marshmallow on top made it for me. Our waiter was great at first, and a bit preoccupied when we were trying to order cheesecake and ask for the check.

And then on top of the long hold, I still waited another 20 minutes for my meal after getting there. ...that was the last time I placed a pick up order. Today I figured I'd give it a try again, and after being on the long hold while driving from work, I'm told it'll be another 25 mins for my to go appetizer and that they don't have the avocado for it.
