37,Rick C.,"Goodyear, AZ",20,2,9.0,3.0,2012-05-23,"Chili's ""  what can I say.. The foods good, prices are average for grill and bar type restaurant . My wife and I enjoy sitting in the lounge area most of the time because of the fact you can just grab a high top table without waiting. I've been going to this location for a few years now, food always good. The problem is, even when their not busy your sitting there waiting for someone to come over as much for 5 to 10 minutes.  I've seen people get up and walk on more than one occasion for lack of service.  Where's the floor mgr of this place . The servers are friendly enough when their there but they pull more disappearing acts than Houdini.   This has been a consistent problem at this location. (bar area) They just recently did an inside and outside makeover which really looks great and chic (New York style)  really cool!! Ok""  Iam being nit picky here, but they took the high top table in the far corner And  replaced it with Handicap table, although I totally agree with the need for handicap tables , I cannot understand the placement of this one.  I've seen handicap patrons trying to maneuver through the high tops trying to get to this table.  Like an obstacle course.   Wouldn't it make more sense to locate this table to the entrance of the lounge for easier access for the handicap, for safety reasons?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=20,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

62,Mak I.,"Florence, AZ",0,22,,3.0,2012-09-20,"Maybe this isn't my week because this is the 2nd time in as many days that I've eaten out and encountered substandard help from the staff but this time the customer to staff ratio really made it ludicrous that I'm having to point this out. I walked into this location around 3pm, aside from me there was 1 customer at the bar and 1 table I was customer # 3. Right when I walked in I went to the restroom to wash up and when I came back I found the hostess stand empty.  As I had walked back to the bathroom there was a pair of the wait staff eating in the back customer table by the bathrooms and exit, don't bother to look up and say hi or anything they just kept on doing their thing.  After leaving the restroom I passed 1 table occupied by a female manager that faced the front door, she was busy in paperwork but also oblivious to the fact that someone was standing there, waiting to be seated only 15 feet directly in front of her, not once did she look up or she would have called someone or taken care of it herself.  From the hostess stand you see directly into the bar area, 1 customer was seated at the bar, 2 employee's were sitting at the booth directly line of sight from the hostess station, they glanced over several times and made no attempt to ask if I needed something.  After 3 minutes (I know this because I was counting 30 second commercials on ESPN) the bartender finally poked her head up and asked me if I needed anything, yes I'd like to be seated and have lunch.  I won't rip her too badly because I sat in her section and she did take care of me well, to the point where I left her a 5 dollar tip, however the fact that 5 front room staff who were only taking care of 4 customers couldn't see it fit to take 10 seconds and do what they are supposed to do almost had me walking out.  The food is basic Chili's, honestly never really had a bad meal there but it's important to point out that even with a manager a few feet away and an empty restaurant, I was left hanging, almost walked out and once that happens, it will be a long time before I come back... there are too many choices in a small area and Chili's is not exactly the best of the best of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=60,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

74,Joyce M.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,11,,1.0,2012-12-22,"If I never want to sit in a Chili's for 3 hours I won't go to this location anymore. Only 3 of us. 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants. The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way. Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said ""Oh, you'll have plenty to eat"" Well, he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff. Then he told us we needed cocktails. Uh, no we wanted sodas/tea. He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins. I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it. We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited. It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others. We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal. it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it. Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills. When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake. We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing. He's had the darn thing before!  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money. I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever. Then he came over complaining about ""Women""! and something about seeing the movie ""The Hobbit"" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $.70  Hello, I'm a woman and I want to see the movie!  I would have paid $7.70 to get the heck out of there.  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them.

45,Christopher S.,"San Francisco, CA",333,12,3.0,1.0,2013-07-29,"Went for lunch and sat in the bar area.  The Good:  Cleanliness was good and service was above average. So far so good... The Bad:  Ordered Fajitas Trio with no beans or rice, as I have ordered countless times at other Chili's. Order came out in a timely manner.... but the food was simply terrible. My stomach churns just remembering it.  So for those who don't know, Fajitas Trio is chicken, steak and shrimp on a hot skillet with sliced onions and bell peppers.  First, the chicken came out with no grill marks, looking like a frozen breast that somebody had thrown into some hot water to cook. Zero grill marks.. I mean, can we at least PRETEND it was grilled? Isn't it supposed to sizzle like in the commercials? The chicken didn't even get grilled on the hot skillet! Which brings me to the skillet... it wasn't hot! How are you going to serve fajitas with a lukewarm skillet? Booo! Get outta here Chilis!  The onions and bell peppers looked (and tasted) like they had been pulled from the freezer too since they had no crunchiness at all.  Shrimp is obviously frozen (this is AZ after all).  The pico de gallo, guac and shredded lettuce all looked a few days past their best by date.  You know how good things are more than a sum of their parts? This was LESS than a sum... each item was bad but collectively, it was a terrible meal especially at the price point ($15!). So maybe my memory has failed and the food was always this bad, but something tells me that this was an exceptionally poor representation.  My friend ordered an appetizer sampler and said the sliders were meh (only ate one) as were the egg rolls.  Summary: low quality food, poor preparation.

I had to return the new Chipotle Chicken Bowl thingy because the strips of chicken were full of fat and this was one of the worst renditions of a bowl meal, plus it wasn't even in a bowl. Anyway, I went for the $6 BLT and that was two strips of bacon, shredded lettuce and one tomato on the ole pretzel bun (it is half a sandwich).

The ribs were served cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box, and neither one of our steaks had any flavor whatsoever.

Today I was craving the steak and asparagus meal that is topped with shrimp. It took almost 40 minutes to get to me and the only thing hot was the skillet and the burnt asparagus. Steak was over cooked and cold. Even had a nice lady next to me say that she hoped I hadn't ordered the steak well done. Nope it was supposed to be medium rare.  Manager came by and offered 50% off meal. I told him I would pay full price and actually left him half of the meal. I figured first time was their mistake, and second time was mine. To make it worse, a couple came in 10 minutes after me and was served their third course ten minutes before I received my cold meal.

My husband and I decided to stop by at this Chili's yesterday for lunch. The hostess was very nice and sat us down right away. Waited for a few minutes for our waitress. She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, ""I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.""  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them. The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable. At some point, I'm sure we saw the manager attempting to clean a table, but we noticed he left it for someone else to clean up. Will never go back to this location.

0,Angelina R.,"Sun City West, AZ",37,64,10.0,3.0,2017-05-07,"Not really impressed. I usually order to-go. They never have my order ready when it should be. The portions are weak for the price paid and the quality is pretty poor. Asking for them to run coupons or discounts is like pulling teeth when you have to wait an extra 15 minutes while your food gets cold sitting there while someone locates a manager.  More distinctively remembered- the food was all carelessly thrown in cheap styrofoam containers that were melting from the heat of the hot food... the food that WAS hot until having to wait 15 minutes for a manager then the drive home. Applebees has legit quality plastic containers for to-go food. Why doesn't Chilis?? One thing I ordered was a side of grilled asparagus w/ Roma tomatoes & garlic. Sad presentation & portion for almost $10 of a charge! 4 weak, skinny, stringy strands of asparagus w/ 2 tiny bite-size cherry tomatoes and probably 10 pieces of garlic just thrown in a giant styrofoam container. I like garlic, but it was majority of garlic that I paid for. I could have gone & bought my own ingredients for half the cost of what this was.  I can't say anything else I ordered was worth it, either. It is like they bank on no one checking to-go orders before they carelessly throw tiny portions in crappy boxes. For the price paid, it was a ripoff and not worth it when it came to the quality of the food, either. And when you are offering coupons/discounts through email, those should be honored with no question, not having to make customers wait 15+ minutes to find a manager to approve what your company is marketing to begin with.  The least they did that was good was throw in an extra side of queso. Had it not been for that gesture, I probably would have left the food and asked for a refund. Please get your act together.
