Dale S.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",40,195,113,1.0,6/8/2015,"When you go in based on Internet web page listed specials.   And order what's there.   1.  Mojito (house) 1. Long Island ice tea (house) Special says 3$ each and your bill is 16+.  Damn.  There's a reason this place is dead.   Even during a Clipper playoff game it's dead.   So take head all those that listen to my reviews.   Stay away.   For a great happy hour, hit up Salt Creek.   As for the picture.   I enjoy the ring up for the Ultimate L.I.I.T.    Side note.    Dig the manager consistently checking the computer for updated sales.  Bad move.   Just reeks of desperation.   And yes, I know what I speak of.

Travis K.,"Bakersfield, CA",79,28,77,2.0,2/26/2015,"So after sitting and waiting for 27 minutes in an empty restaurant at 1145, the bar keep, after getting snapped at by us, finally took our drink and food order for a party of 4, 3 adults and 1 kid.   Original ""waitress"" told bar keep it wasn't her table.  Cause the nasty looks will keep coming and bar keep will get a decent tip.   Haven't been here since I was a kid so I was looking foward to eating here, very disappointing. So after 1 hour,  we finally got our drinks and our food arrived shortly after. Rating a 2 star because the burger, beer and step up from the bar keep to help us.  Overall, very disappointed in this visit, especially with the waitress arguing over who's table was who's.  Can't believe it took us to threaten to walk out to get help at our table.  Honestly, I don't see coming back to this location anytime soon.   2 hours after showing up, eating our food and drinks, the manager finally came by and asked about our visit.  We said OK then she walked away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2

This was already a pretty gross restaurant to begin with but they have given up all hope. The waitress uncomfortably came to our table at the end of our meal and demanded that we tip her a specific amount, and forced us to divide that amount evenly among everyone in our party.

Teresa M.,"Honolulu, HI",11,42,1,1.0,6/8/2015,"Poor, slow service! Restaurant wasn't busy, but it took them 10 minutes to seat us, another 15 minutes for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and 30 minutes to bring us our drinks because they had to brew more tea Then, after ordering appetizers, it took them forever to bring it out. To make matters worse, it took forever for our main courses to be served. Mind you, we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm and left at 8:40pm.  To add to this review, the restaurant was dark, dingy, and dirty. They didn't clean the floors after a huge party had left and the restaurant was empty. Does anyone work here? It also smelled pretty funky",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2
Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,980,3113,4.0,3/3/2015,"For my birthday dinner, Schoolteacher asked where I would like to eat dinner. Looking through my remaining birthday emails, I realized it had been some time since I'd been to this TGI Fridays. Certainly long before my yelp days. So, I asked if we could have dinner here. Plus, I had a free birthday desert email.      We parked up on the top level of the parking structure, and then walked down to the restaurant. Turns out on Thursdays they've actually got a farmers market happening here within the shopping plaza. We poked around the vendors selling their jewelries, and their fruits and vegetables. While wandering around, I bought her a bouquet of flowers, we tried some local salsa, and then we finally meandered into TGI Fridays.       The place was fairly empty, and we were quickly greeted and seated in the bar area by the hostess. The table between us was fairly tiny, and when the waitress brought the free chips and salsa because I'm a member of that stripes club, I had to move them up to the top of the wall between us and the booth on the other side.  The waitress who worked with us was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and quick. She was really good at her job and quite honestly made the whole night better.       After perusing the menu and accidentally playing footsie with schoolteacher beneath the tiny tiny table, I went with the Cajun Shrimp & chicken Pasta. Schoolteacher went with the far healthier Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad. We chatted about our days and the discovery of the farmers market while waiting for our foods to come out, which wasn't too long afterwards.       The food was presented well, and delivered hot. My Cajun pasta was tasty, and Schoolteacher's salad was also good.  After eating the massive pasta meal, I was pretty stuffed, and asked helpful waitress lady which desert kept best. She suggested a few, and from among those I chose the Red Velvet cake with ice cream.  Helpful waitress lady even had the cake separately packed from the ice cream, as to not cause soggy Red Velvet Cake. She also had the chips and salsa packed up, being careful to pour the salsa into sealed containers so they didn't spill on the chips and soggy them up either.  I really did like helpful waitress lady. She was super helpful and really on the ball.      As we wrapped up dinner and exited, I thanked waitress lady and hostess girl on our way out of the place. I also thanked Schoolteacher for picking up the bill.  It was a pretty good night all around. Thanks everybody! You made my birthday dinner pretty dang great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2

Shannon B.,"Tehachapi, CA",63,60,72,1.0,7/30/2014,"Very disappointed. We have been to the location in Burbank and had a great experience. However we won't be going back to this location EVER. In the women's restroom the toilet wouldn't flush and one of their faucets were broken. The waitress never refilled my drink. The kids burgers were more like sliders. The kids fruit had canned pineapples not fresh. The French fries were gross. We asked for a fresh batch thinking they were old, and they still weren't good. My husband ordered the French dip and it is a very tiny sandwich. It tasted like it had canned onions on it. My husband eats just just about everything but he was very unhappy with his food. I had Fajatias and the meat was very undercooked to my taste and I wasn't asked how well done I wanted it. Definitely wouldn't be going back to that location.  Oh I forgot, my son ordered a kids milkshake and he received blended ice milk. Gross. Who doesn't know how to make a milkshake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2
Robin H.,"Lancaster, CA",272,56,340,2.0,9/6/2013,"I am so upset about my experience I swear I could just cry (because I had been looking forward to it)! Oh and trust me, I took pictures to show you how dripping blood and under-cooked the hamburger was! And to show you how the hamburger looks in the picture on the menu and on the commercial. Myyyyy burger had less then a 1/4 teaspoon of the sauce, and one tiny little itty bitty speck of an onion. NOTHING like how it looks on the menu or on the commercial! I had to request an order of the onions and sauce on the side! I drove all the way down to Valencia from Lancaster (an hour drive), specially because I had wanted to get that burger (had seen it on the commercial). Ohh yeah and when we first walked in, they were just standing around talking, goofing off and laughing with each other. She even looked at me standing there waiting for them and she didn't care. Fiiiiiinally she came over to us and said, ""How many?"" to seat us. WOW! Are you serious!? Other restaurants do not ever do that. How rude and unprofessional.  PRO'S: Our waiter was very nice and friendly! The margarita's were delicious! The bacon mac n' cheese bites were scrumptious! My boy friend liked it that they had the USC fight live on pay-per-view!

Nicole B.,"Sacramento, CA",498,244,224,5.0,10/16/2014,"I recently moved to Sacramento from the LA area (where I was born and raised)  and I had my going away dinner here with some of my close friends at TGIFridays! What a great experience! our waitress was so awesome, she was really patient with everyone as it was a larger party and she spent a good amount of time at our table. Our drinks were always full and she took the time to separate all the checks, which I am sure was a nightmare. The food was great for happy hour food and rather cheap as well. The drinks were consistent and good every time(touché bartender!) . This is fridays, a cool weekend spot for a non-special occasion but a place you take your wife to for your wedding anniversary. For this reason I feel that I had a 5 star experience. The wait staff, prices and food & drinks were beyond my expectations. Thank you Friday's staff, my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves while saying goodbye for now and your excellent service made it easy for us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,801,7330,2.0,11/5/2011,"(Dined 10/31/11 M): I must preface that I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and unfortunately TGI Friday's does nothing to sway my thoughts on that. I had lunch with a colleague and this location is in walking distance to work (which seems to be the only reason why I've eaten here on other occasions). Plus, I had a promotional coupon offer, so why not? There wasn't much of a lunch rush to speak of so we were seated rather quickly. I do like their strawberry lemonade (although I feel Red Robin's version is better) ($3.29) so that was a must. Otherwise, I also ordered the Jack Daniels pulled pork sandwich ($7.99) which came with a side of french fries. [My colleague's order is excluded from this review.] I love pulled pork sandwiches but in this particular case, it seemed a bit salty for my taste so I used the Jack Daniels side sauce liberally. The french fries weren't anything special, either. The service was decent as there seemed to be only one person in our area, and eventually more patrons started showing up. My water glass wasn't filled up as often as I normally like. I didn't partake this time, but there is a bar area with TVs showing games. I've been here more for their happy hour which is decent. Parking is ample. Hell, it's in a mall! Overall, the entire experience was so-so. I never expect much in the way of food quality at places  such as TGI Friday's, BJ's, and the like. They are good places to hang out and grab a drink with friend or colleagues, but the food is usually second-rate, from my experience. So it is what it is. I can't honestly say there is much value because the food has to be good...it's a freakin' restaurant. But TGI Friday's is a place to grab some inexpensive sustenance as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was under $15 before tip with the buy-one get-one free offer). I just don't think it's worth it. On the bright side, they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2

Randi M.,"Canyon Country, CA",322,886,151,2.0,9/4/2013,"My issue is with the service.  The food is ok, not the best, not the worst.  Sign up on their website and you'll get a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert.   I'm part of a group that goes out to eat in the SCV every Tuesday night.  We pick Tuesday because restaurants are not normally busy and can handle our group.  Last night we had 14ppl and the restaurant wasn't busy, but service still took forever.  We didn't get our drinks until 30 min after we were seated.  We didn't give our orders until 40 min.  I finally got up to speak to a manager and he came over and said he would take care of us.  He handed me some free appetizer coupons so I passed those out and the group ordered a few apps.  Later, the manager came back over and gave me a few more.  We asked for some pitchers of soda so the overwhelmed server wouldn't have to keep coming over to refill drinks.  That seemed to work out well.  I had the cobb salad and it was fine.  The chicken was moist, the produce was fresh.  My partner had a flat iron steak that she ordered medium well and it came medium rare.  She ate around the rare parts and didn't complain.  We had the loaded chips for an appetizer and those were tasty.  A nice change from nachos.  I tasted the spinach dip too and that was good.  The food was ok, its a chain, what do you want?  I can always find something at a chain that will be acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2

I did not Yelp it first because I assumed the brand is consistent everywhere.  Oh how wrong I was.  Our waitress was totally fine.  It took 20 minutes to get any food.  It seems like they were only focused in the bar as there were only a couple if families eating.  I got the fried shrimp and it was obviously old and had been retried to heat, making it a soggy disgusting mess.  My daughters fries were so smushy and limp that the texture was similar to mashed potatoes.   The owner must make all the money off of liquor because the food is horrendous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2

James H.,"Valencia, CA",38,61,,2.0,9/21/2013,"Lackluster food for the price. I had a burger which was supposed to have melted cheddar and asiago cheese and a garlic aioli. The burger was cooked perfectly, but I couldn't taste the asiago, and the garlic aioli tasted an awful lot like plain mayonnaise. I might as well have gotten a plain cheddar cheese burger. The steak fries tasted more like cold chunks of potato with a crusty substance which was supposed to be parmesan (it tasted nothing of the sort) scantly sprinkled about. My wife's chicken was over-cooked, stringy, and crunchy. Yes, crunchy, nothing more to say on that.

Luna W.,"Reseda, CA",13,102,,3.0,9/17/2012,"This was the first time I ever went to a TGI Friday's and I will say that the experience was alright. We had a family reservation for about twenty of us for a family member's 60th birthday. The seating arrangement was alright and the staff were very friendly (too friendly for my taste, almost talking to us like we were children...). Though I'd rather have an overly friendly staff than a bunch of jerks. The restaurant itself is very family oriented and has a decent atmosphere, we were close to the restrooms which I found convenient for such a large party.  I have wanted to try TGIF for awhile now, mostly because of its 2 for $20 deal. What I found very interesting was the fact that they DID NOT give you that menu. You have to specifically ask for it, otherwise you will not see it on the regular menu (at least not at this restaurant).  The 2 for $20 menu is quite limited, however this is expected. I believe you have about 6 entrees to choose from. In this deal you get: 1) Share a Shrimp Cocktail or Order any appetizer at same or lesser value (which would be $9.99, you can choose from almost all the appetizers).  2) Two Entrees (which has a choice of about six or seven entrees I think). 3) Share a Dessert Remember to look at SHARE - this means only one, which is fine to be honest. I had a hot chocolate (can't go wrong with a hot chocolate if you hate coffee). The mug is very large and you have lots of whip cream to go with it, yums. My mother and I skipped out on the Shrimp Cocktail and instead got the Fried Mozzarella which was quite delicious. For an entree I had the Petite Sirloin with french fries (yeah i suck at picking sides). I recommend you get some kind of vegetable in there for this meal. I ordered the sirloin medium well and it came out tough anyway. It was delicious at first but then toughened as I continued to eat it. The fries are yummy though.  My mother had the Pork Chops which was deliciously juicy and very much recommended.  For the dessert we shared the Brownie Obsession - that was heaven! That is a delicious dessert, big enough for two, maybe even three. The brownie was super hot, but that just meant it was fresh! It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and pecan nuts.  Overall I was mostly disappointed with my sirloin... I usually don't get meat/steak at restaurants but I didn't want to get the usual chicken strips (which i regret now).  HOWEVER - I don't mind coming back to try the chicken strips and the pork chops and taste another delicious dessert. I personally would only recommend if you're just going out for no real reason and you're hungry, not for a date or party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=40

Well we all tried something different - (and with extra appetizers since they were half-off) and everyone really enjoyed their food. The burgers were huge and juicy, the freshly made potato chips were salty/crispy goodness and the other dishes measured up. Hint- get the chips, not the fries! Sure, not exactly ***** posh dining- but a great place to go with friends and have a fun meal at a reasonable price.  (Of course the 15% PayForward card rebate made it even better.)

It took her forever to take our order, i guess shuffling over to our table would have distracted her too much from observing air go in and out of her lungs. We were starving, so we asked for some breadsticks first. The breadsticks came out at the same time as the appetizer....which came out at the same time as our food! When the other waiters came to bring our food, and realized we were the table that they just brought the appetizer to, they were like ""Huh?"" I was like can you please be our server, you look alert and lucid. But what i said was , ""yea, in some places its customary to get your appetizer before your entree, but i guess thats too quaint for a ritzy place like this."" I didnt say that either.

Service wasn't great , it took the guy 10 min to bring ur drinks ( he was serving only two other tables) Food came out and only thing that was good was steak thats one star there otherwise if I could I wouldn't give none. My shrimps were salty, brocolli disgusting and fries felt like it was cooked yesterday. My husbands ribs horrible, he used to love it because that Jack Daniels sauce but thats it, it was dry, just a little of meat between bones and fries were not good either. Normaly I would return it and walk out of there but because we were really hungry and tired we eat it.

Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,1.0,9/8/2011,"Believe it or not, I have never been to a TGI Fridays before in my life. My bff, baffled, said that we HAD to go. Okay, how bad could it have been? HMMM...where do I start?  My friend raved about the bruschetta chicken and pasta. The balsamic never should have even been in that dish. Now, I understand that we all have our different palettes, but this was just not the right fit for mine, I guess. I thought the balsamic overpowered the dish and it left my tongue sort of raw, chintzy portion of chicken (the chicken was the only good part of the entire dish), would have been nice if this came with a nice piece of garlic bread or something. My friend got the dragon chicken in rice with vegetables. The ""dragon"" glaze on the chicken didn't taste good, the rice was undercooked way too much to be enjoyable and my friend asked that they not put any broccoli on her plate and that's all the vegetable they gave her. She had maybe 5  bites total and put it off to the side. Luckily, we had gotten the shrimp appetizer which was glazed in this wonderful sauce. Had we not gotten that, neither of us would have been satisfied.  The waitress took my friends meal off the check, clearly she did not like it and when a box was offered, she declined. I had eaten half of mine, so really I couldn't have asked her to take that off too. Before we had ordered, we told the waitress that we had some email coupons, one for buy one entree, get one free and another for 30% off the entire bill. The waitress took my friends meal off, so clearly we wouldn't have wanted to use the buy one get one half off deal. My friend mentioned that we would like for the coupon to be honored. The waitress rudely told her that she had already taken her meal off, as if to say that she did us a favor so shut up, how dare you want something else taken off? She pointed out that there were two coupons on there and she wanted to use the 30% off one, she took the receipt back and then threw it back on the table. Well, not threw it, but sort of rashly plopped it back on the table. We didn't like the vibes she gave us at all.  I wished I could have tipped her better, but I'm not one for the employee to tell the customer that they are wrong, especially if its a disagreement like that. She easily could have told us that she didn't understand or ask if there was maybe another coupon that she didn't know about. It's not like it said they couldn't honor the coupon if the waitress took an entree off the bill.  I'll gladly try this place again, as long as its at a different location and I try something else.

I was very disappointed. The service was awful. I wanted to give the person helping us the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she had a long day. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe her boyfriend dumped her and she was taking it out on us. But then i walked to the bar to get a drink and the bartender was worse. Three people doing nothing walked by me as if i were invisible. Some guy sitting at the bar tried helping me and they ignored him too. Oh well.

Janilyn R.,"Rosamond, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/6/2015,"So we went in for the BOGO (Buy one get one free dinner) it was a Tues night and hardly anyone was there so plenty of empty tables but we got sat at an uncomfortable table in the very back by the server station and back door where everyone went out to smoke. Why? I have no idea...The view was horrible. All we could see were cleaning supplies, the kitchen and whatever it was behind the server station. The waiter wasn't any better. He seemed new and lacked personality among much knowledge of the food or drinks served there. We ordered the steak and lobster which seemed to be the ticket for the night but it wasn't all that good. The lobster wasn't cooked and the rest was just bla. The bill for 3 people even with the one free dinner came to $82 and we left feeling that we much rather spend that kind of money elsewhere. Not a memorable night at all. Probably won't ever go back.

The spinach dip looked like vomit on a plate. My burger was rare when I asked for medium. The waiter asked if I wanted another drink,  I declined and asked for an ice tea. He forgot about it and brought it out with the check. If it wasn't the holiday season I wouldn't have tipped him anything. Fridays had their time. Now it's over.

Gina G.,"Cleveland, OH",561,465,232,1.0,5/3/2009,"I've been here a hand-full of times in different scenarios and EVERY time it sucks worse than the last. Yes, they have alcohol. Yes, it'd damn good. But every time I get suckered into coming here, I end up having to pay for another crappy meal that sucked goat balls.  Friday night me and the BFF came here for dinner. She's obsessed with balsamic vinaigrette. (Don't ask.) So, we get there, they seat us and I have to pee, because I have the bladder of a 4 year old. So I go pee. The bathroom is disgusting. For the most part, its 8:00pm on a Friday night; it is not drink o'clock yet. Why does the women's bathroom smell like dookie logs? Why are there rolls of toilet paper strewn about the floor. Why in the FUCK is there a tampon on the floor? DISGUSTING.  So with that said, lets move on to the meal. I ordered the Strawberry Fields salad. Tami ordered the Jack Daniel's Flat Iron steak, medium well, with broccoli and a side salad with a gallon of balsamic. lol. (that Tami, she's crazy) Anyway, Tami gets her side salad first. But how do they expect her to eat it with no silverware and no napkin? After about 5 minutes, someone comes back with place settings.  Then, they bring the food, and my plate looks like that song ""On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese..."" only it went something like this. ""On top of iceberg lettuce all covered with cheese, i lost my 4 tiny chicken strips..."". Horrid. Horrid horrid! I could have sworn the menu said baby greens, not baby pieces of iceberg lettuce. Gross. I'm not a lettuce Nazi, but when I pay $13 for a salad, it better not have the cheap shit lettuce in it! The chicken was dry. The strawberries were pre-frozen and mushy. The little bit of candied nuts were almost invisible. Let me tell you - the cheese, there was a-plenty! It was Romano cheese. You know? The kind that tastes and smells like a gym locker room. It was a thick layer all over the already-shitty ensemble. I ate three bites and threw in my napkin.  Tami's steak was practically crispy. The cow was FOR SURE dead. There was no doubt about it. She ate half of the tiny palm-sized steak and finished her over-cooked broccoli and she was done also. Sad sad days for TGI Friday's. How does this place stay in business with a BJ's within walking distance? Cheap booze and dart boards is my guess, because the food SUCKS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=80
Jennifer B.,"Long Beach, CA",29,6,,4.0,2/20/2010,"Congratulations T.G.I. Friday's, in order to champion you I have officially become a member of Yelp. I am no longer a lurker, hiding in the shadows reading reviews, I have an identity. Okay, now to proceed with the championing: The food here isn't gourmet and the decor is definitely not chic, but you really shouldn't expect that going in, should you? This is T.G.I. Friday's we're talking about. :-) My boy friend and I come here on a regular basis and the service has always been great. Yes, they can be slow at times BUT our server always keeps the lines of communication open with us. We never feel forgotten about. Maybe I'm setting too low of a standard here but in this day and age good communication in any job of the customer service genre seems too few and far between. Just a few examples: Last week we came here for dinner and ordered sweet potato fries as our appetizer. Our server forgot to include the dipping sauces we requested with them but we let it slide as he seemed new and the place was really busy. About half way through the fries he comes back, apologizes, and offers to bring us out a new plate with dipping sauce. A server that catches his/her mistake AND offers to correct it without me asking? That's rare. I usually start off here with a Long Island Tea with Diet Coke (hey, a girl's gotta save on calories where she can!). One night we happened to get the same server that we had about a month prior and I asked for a Long Island Tea. She says okay and starts to walk away, then turns right back around and asks if I wanted it with Diet Coke because she knows that's how I usually order it.  The food is decent and the drinks are strong. I am digging their Shrimp Key West, the boyfriend usually gets the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese. Their Long Island Tea and their Mudslide are definite winners. Bottom line: What can I say? I'm a sucker for nice people and strong drinks. We'll keep coming here as long as the service stays the same, no matter how slow they can be or mediocre the food is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=80

Carrie D.,"Pasadena, CA",1501,416,2,4.0,2/21/2009,"TGI Friday's Valencia, I just can't quit you! You know how it is when you are doing something you are not supposed to do? You know it is bad and wrong. You know people will disapprove. You know God is going to damn you straight to hell. Yet, like a junkie with a monkey on their back, you just keep doing it. Maybe no one will see me. Just one more time. I can stop if I want to. This is my relationship with my local TGI Friday's. I know what I am doing is wrong. I know that people will definitely disapprove. And, I know that I am going straight to hell...but I just can't quit my Friday's. Here's why: Happy Hour starts at 3 p.m. Monday-Friday (bar only.) Some of us want or need to get our drink on early. This is a full hour to 1 1/2 hours earlier than most places. They have good deals on drinks and bar food. Think about how many extra alcoholic beverages and plates of deep-fried food that can add to you day. The well drinks are stiff, the beer is cheap, and the bar food is 50% off. What is so wrong about that??? Don't judge me! Happy Hour is all day on Sunday in both the restaurant and the bar. Woo hoo...cheap booze on Sunday. And on the 7th day God drank cheap booze! It's in the bible somewhere...trust me. OK, here's the part that has me hooked above all else...If you join the stripes club (their rewards club) you accumulate points for every dollar you spend...sometimes they give you double points. Once you reach 100 points they email you a coupon for $8 off. Additionally they constantly send out BOGO and free appetizer coupons. And, when you eat in the bar or restaurant your reciept has a survey that you can fill out online. Once you do...bingo another free appetizer. So, while their food is far from gourmet it is consistently OK...but seriously what are you expecting at Friday's? The service is OK...again TGI Friday's, hello. But, dollar for dollar, you can certainly spend alot more in Santa Clarita for ""OK"" food. The menu is diverse and they are great about allowing substitutions. There are actually some good healthier choices, which is great for me when I am doing the high protein, low-fat training thing.  Cheap booze! Cheap food! Free food! Really, the dark side is not so bad. Still, you might want to wear a hat and dark glasses so people don't recognize you as you walk in...damn! Now I have to change my disguise. If you see someone in a clown suit walking into Friday's, it's not me ; )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valencia-2?start=80

They have an extensive drink menu and they have varied choices of food which is nice when you just can't make up your mind what you want.

Ender S.,"Chatsworth, CA",2,37,36,2.0,1/2/2014,"Just went here with my wife and kids. My last day off before returning to work from holiday break so I wanted to eat somewhere I never been. We landed here at Fridays since we had a 25% off the bill coupon and I've always heard great things about the appetizers. We were seated promptly but everything was downhill from there. We weren't offered any drinks for at least 10 minutes, The drinks (adios) and the (mango mai Thai) were weaker that an Odouls with a splash of bud light. I ordered extra cheese on the nachos, upon their arrival it appears they were low on cheese, as well the cheese was not even melted. The entire plate was cold to the last bite. Hungry as we were, we continued. The food came, I went with the double stacked burger, the wife with a regular one. The kids both got the ribs. The fries were all cold and tasted rather old, the burger wasn't anything to write home about either but it sufficed. Our waitress seemed to keep getting lost inside (we were seated outside) and come time for the bill we waited a good 10 min or so for her to return to get that. All in all.

The food wasn't even palatable the drinks were seriously watered down and $4 for a pint of blue moon? (and that was the special price). The waitress we had was forgetful and it took her 20 minutes to actually get everyone's drinks out. The place was also pretty dead even at 11:00pm when we left. I seem to remember TGIF was a really popular place even just a year ago.

Pretty annoying. The bar is always really loud and crowded, but I've never cared to venture into it. The food and service get 1 star and late hours get another.
