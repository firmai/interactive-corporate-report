Kelly A.,"Everett, MA",0,1,,3.0,10/22/2017,Went in earlier today and got seated right away. Our food took almost an hour to come out and they forgot the fries to my burger... the service however was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge
Sam C.,"Charlestown, MA",254,149,609,1.0,12/2/2017,"I used to love going to Cheesecake Factory but took a short break...now I see why I did. This time we only went for the cheesecake pick up (after calling in) - easy enough...you would think.  SO disappointed. Anybody who knows me knows I rarely give one star and (TRY) to be patient, but service was too bad this time. I called at exactly 5:30pm for a 6inch strawberry cheesecake and mentioned I will be there in 20 minutes. I ALSO double checked and made sure the cake can be ready for me to just grab and go - OK GREAT. (I know it's Saturday night and it gets super busy and I don't know what it takes to make a cheesecake. Mostly because I don't eat them and this was for a bday.)  We get there just past 6pm (so more than the 20 minute warning) and they say it's not ready and is being decorated, which will take 5-10 minutes. Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (""it's not ready yet"")...and wait. We then proceeded  to watch one of the ""bakers"" take a finished frozen cake out of the fridge to put on strawberries and frosting.... Please note that during this time, I was able to re-download Yelp (new phone! Yay), check in, and write this review. Yes, disappointed.  As Mama would say: If you can't estimate the timing, don't estimate. When you set the expectation, meet it. Please and thank you.  Having said that, this is a not as nice rant and I am sure I'll eventually try another Cheesecake Factory again...maybe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge
Diane H.,"Boston, MA",436,685,726,2.0,11/13/2017,"Meh. Meh. Meh. You would think for dropping $67 before tip for a lunch for two, this experience would be at least delightful. We came hungry, it was 2pm on a Sunday not lunch rush or dinner but everything was just slow. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip which took 20 mins to come- it was good but the bread it came with was hard as a rock. Is cheesecake factory going to pay for my dentist appointment if my teeth somehow breaks trying to chew on this? The boy got an alcoholic drink which he enjoyed and I got a strawberry fruit smoothie which I will advise you to stay away because it's seeds city in there.  The worst part of this was that the boy ordered one of the ""specials"" which happen to be pineapple chicken and shrimp (rice dish). No where did it say it contained cilantro and when it came.......40 mins later it was the biggest part of the meal. HE DESPISES cilantro but did not want to wait for them to remake since it already took so long in the first place so he didn't say anything and attempted to eat it. Oh- to top if off they did not include ANY shrimp but they decided to add in an extra ingredient which he also hates- MUSHROOMS. Wow, just wow. I'm impressed that the chef decided to just alter the dish to his own liking instead of ours. The food runner even said this is the pineapple chicken and shrimp dish. LOL My pasta was fine, I got the FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge
Chris H.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",109,267,766,3.0,5/26/2017,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain restaurant. You should know what to expect.  Our experience started with us sitting at a table without seeing any server for about 20 minutes. We had to finally go and ask someone to come help us. We sat near the bar and asked for the Red Sox game to be put on the TV a couple times...it never happened. Once we had our server she was really nice and helpful. It just took awhile to get to that point. I had the vegan Cobb salad and it was wicked good. Definitely surpassed my expectations. My mom got the original Cobb salad and ""wished"" she had gone with the vegan Cobb! My wife had a ziti vegetable dish and it was so-so. It was an average dish. The vegan Cobb definitely stole the show. My mom loves this place, so we always come here when family is in town.

Connor P.,"Boston, MA",22,234,50,2.0,3/30/2017,"I'm not sure what the overall hype is for this place. They do have an incredibly massive menu, but that's really the only good part.  Maybe it was the certain location I went to. We sat down fairly quick and got our drinks and bread, then ordered a meal and an appetizer for a table of 4. 45 minutes passed and the waitress kept saying our food was coming. She brought out the app with the food which took 45 minutes and they were ice cold hamburger sliders (good taste though). My 3 colleagues received their food and must have waited 5-10 minutes for them to bring me mine. I'm under the impression they forgot my order and thought the app was mine even though I didn't order the app. Anyways, chicken tacos were cold, not much flavor, weak tortilla to hold all the soggy ingredients. Everyone else seemed to like their meal but we were all amazed at the lack of attentive service. I'll try another location but this one was not good. Don't expect the meal to take less than 2 hours at the rate they move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge
Tom B.,"Portland, CT",6,71,23,3.0,3/31/2017,"Yup, it's a cheesecake factory.

Emily S.,"Norwood, MA",164,312,136,3.0,10/16/2017,"It is a Cheesecake Factory - just like other reviews have stated. I am walking in knowing what I am getting, not expecting a 5 Michelin Star experience. I met some friends here before an event and we did not need to wait for a table, which was a huge plus! Our server was attentive but did not hover, and really understood that we wanted to take our time and not be rushed along, that is a big deal since in high traffic places like this, servers want to understandably flip tables for more money. She was great! Our drinks from the bar came in a decent amount of time and were tasty as well. Our food also came out pretty fast, I was impressed, but we may have made it in before the mad rush. The food we ordered was good and we all were satisfied. Again, this is a Cheesecake Factory - it is what it is. The food and drinks were good, service was good and it served it's purpose, there were no complaints and no shining moments, just decent food, decent service and good location for what we needed it for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge

Our server was sweet but it took so long to get so many things. It took forever to get greeted, it took forever to get a straw for one of us, it took forever to get drinks, food, bread, and I never got a refill on my water.

I ordered a friggin salad and it came out a few minutes after she brought over the burger. Like, really? And the whole place was pretty much empty and they sat us across from the bathroom.

Augie A.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,2,1.0,1/9/2017,"In from Atlanta, staying at a nearby hotel (where I should have stuck to vending machine snacks for dinner, v. Eating here).  Called in my order.  Asked what sides come with what I was ordering (which was a combo of grilled salmon and shrimp scampi), I was told by the girl on the phone, ""mashed potatoes... and whatever comes with the salmon and whatever comes with the scampi"". Ha! I could have guessed two thirds of that response. I call the number from the curbside parking (as instructed on their website), no answer. Okay. I go in, pick it up and pay, including a 10% tip (it's take out), and I ask for utensils.  Get to my room (two minutes away), EVERY THING is swimming in some kind of cream sauce. Wrong order. There is shrimp and there is salmon, but clearly not what I ordered (check out the pic after I choked it down). And cold to boot. And I got two plastic forks. That's it.  Don't patronize this place.  I'm not hard to please, but this was a joke, if not a slap in the face. I guess $35.00 for take out dinner for one, doesn't warrant a little attention to detail.  Horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. UPDATE: Just spoke to the manager. He told me they get a lot of complaints about the combos and I should write a letter to corporate.  How about instead, I just never eat at ANY Cheesecake Factory, ever.  I hope potential investors read reviews... save your money folks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge

Erika R.,"Chantilly, VA",196,9,4,2.0,4/30/2017,"I'm in the middle of dining at the restaurant right now and it's not looking very good from how everything is presenting itself. I was surprised to see no host at the front for minutes and was amazed to find that there wasn't a wait time when I came in with my family to the restaurant and we were seated fairly quickly.  As we sat down the waitress told us the specials and took down our drinks, appetizers, and a request that we have only the honey wheat bread before she left.  The drinks were simple: iced tea, coke, water with lemon, strawberry lemonade, and buffalo wings. When the waitress returned several minutes later, she forgot we ordered all honey wheat; as well as my mother's lemon for her water. Then it turned out that they ran out of iced tea? So my father opted to order a strawberry lemonade as well after placing our main entrees and my brother realized his coke was flat. Right now, my father is still waiting on his soup; I re-ordered the lemon for my mother that has yet to arrive; and a table next to ours had gotten all honey wheat bread as well as their meal when we had gotten in 15 minutes before them (maybe that's me also being a bit bitter). Sitting in the dining area, I'm trying to remain optimistic that maybe there are hiccups within the kitchen and the rest of the dining staff, but it doesn't make much sense to me seeing as though there are also several open tables and that more than 30 minutes have already elapsed where I'm not presented with a meal and that there are still appetizer plates and an empty bread bowl that hadn't been taken away. Maybe about ~5-7 minutes after I finished writing my last statement the food came out and the waitress had a surprised look on her face when my father asked about his soup and she ran back to get it saying it was on its way. When she came back, we asked for a third time about the lemon, but said it was for the entree of a pan seared salmon and the Asian taco lettuce wraps. I ordered farfalle where bacon bits were burnt and it seemed as though the tomatoes were raw and simply cut and thrown into the dish. Then my brother's jambalaya pasta was drenched with a watery sauce. After ordering dessert, service improved, but by that point, I've already made my opinion on this location of the establishment. This is my typical go-to restaurant in an area I'm not familiar with and the result of this was very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge

Matt B.,"West Roxbury, MA",8,29,,1.0,8/3/2017,"This was by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to accommodating customers. We have a reservation for 15 people, which include 2 under the age of 3 and 1 over the age of 85 with a walker. As the party began to arrive, we were told there was a policy not to seat a party until 80% (12 people) were there. As we asked and spoke with the manager, we were told they would not seat us even though the table was friendly. When asked if they would rather make a 85 year old with a walker and 2 crying/hungry kids wait then sit, we were told yes and there's nothing they would do. After finally getting sat, the drinks were extremely slow and not made correctly. I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone with a large group.

He immediately brought us water, some beer, and a basket of bread. Mmm I love the bread basket in the cheesecake factory. After that, he took our orders. There is the normal menu as well as a skinny menu. I had one of the lunch options from the normal menu, the lunch portions are smaller and cheaper than the regular options. I had the miso salmon, which came on a bed of brown rice. The rice was a little too packed together, the salmon was ok. After we had finished our meal, our waiter said that we could each get 2 slices of cheese cake for free. How awesome is that!

I got the Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake which was delicious.  For those that are vegetarian or keep halal, as you may know, many of CF's cheesecakes have gelatin in them.

Corin B.,"Everett, MA",49,12,4,2.0,2/16/2017,"I came in last night with my boyfriend at around 8:30ish. It wasn't too busy and we were sat towards the back which I didn't mind at all. The food was good and the atmosphere is quiet, however the service wasn't great at all.  I was a waitress for years and normally try not to complain about service but it really made our time unpleasant. We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn't catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn't want us there either. Everything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn't getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine. As we were nearing the end of the meal she came over and my boyfriend asked to have his food wrapped up. I didn't even have a chance to ask for mine wrapped as she grabbed his plate and whipped around and walked off so fast. She came back with his food and again immediately walked away so quickly I couldn't ask for my food to be wrapped up. When she finally did come back I was able to get my food wrapped up and we asked for a dessert menu. My guess is she probably wasn't going to offer one because she certainly didn't want us there any longer. We ordered one piece of cheesecake to split and she brought it over with our check but insisted there was ""no rush"". After we finished up dessert she asked if we were all set with the check, which we hadn't even touched it yet as we were still eating but we put the cash in anyways. She came over and asked if it was all set again. We said yes and she asked ""do you need change?"" My boyfriend said no and that was the end. No ""thank you"", ""have a nice night"", nothing. To spend over $80 on dinner and feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed the entire time was just not worth it whatsoever. We were checked on maybe 2-3 times the entire night and never once asked/offered refills for our drinks. We would've asked ourselves but barely got to speak as she spun around and ran from our table the few times she did come over. I've been in the industry myself so I really try not to nitpick or even complain at all but it really did ruin our night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=20
susie k.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,3.0,6/11/2017,"People often complain about the quality control of chain restaurants, but this cheesecake Factory is my go to place when I'm hungry, don't have reservations, and want a place that will satisfy all picky eaters in a large group.  The wait at this place can sometimes be long and service can be slow, but I've rarely left here feeling disappointed.   Reading through the menu is like reading a novel. and deciding what to eat feels overwhelming, but I like this place because the food is good, it's a great place to take kids because it's loud, a good place to get a drink with a meal, and a reliable place for large groups.  Also, it's large enough place that I don't feel guilty if I stay longer than my meal.  Will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=20

Nandanie S.,"Quincy, MA",418,523,355,3.0,1/4/2016,"I think the Cheesecake Factory is best for apps and dranks and cheesecake. Each time I've gotten an entree, it falls short. I got the basil shrimp pasta, and it was a little tasteless. I had to drown it a little in black pepper to taste good. Apps were YUMMY! Fried mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, and calamari were all delicious. Seriously...next time i'll just get an appetizer for a meal. I got the pineapple moscow mule for a cocktail, and it was nice. Cheesecake was the salted caramel one, which I took half home for hubby bear. Great spot for hanging out, but I just may not entrees next time. They're huge and sometimes unappealing.

Erik P.,"Thornton, NH",0,38,1,1.0,8/31/2017,"For starters this place should be good. But it isn't. We sat in the bar area where you didn't need to be seated by the hostess who mind you wasn't in site. Then about 10 minutes waiting our waitress showed up. We eventually ordered food, how ever the chicken came out cold. Ok so upon mentioning this issue the chicken went away and we waited. I swear we waited so long that I thought I watched a snail racing across to the finish line. Manager didn't come around to apologize. We had to stop one in his tracks to inform him the problem. And did he offer anything to make up for it? Or to stop us from leaving? Nope. Instead we got a typical ""sorry""!!!!! So another. But that's not the point. We waited and waited until we were almost done with the salad. What is the point of having a chicken salad without the chicken? Sorry? That's it? Offer us a free dessert or something. So finally a hot plate of chicken came to our table by another manager. She offered ""anything else I can do for you?"" Yeah take it off our bill. Or give us a couple of sweet freebies so I can feel loved by cheesecake. So we finished our food. And waited another 30 years (as it felt) again watching the same snail moving to the other side of the finish line. Our waitress came and asked the typical question. Anything else? Yeah my check so I can escape the inescapable. And empty my tummy by walking. She finally came with the check. ****** and was anything done?******** noooo!!! So I grabbed the manager nearly pulling his shirt Out and asked to take off the chicken at least because of the fact that we ate a chicken salad without the chicken. And did he offer anything? Nope!!! Typical guy who collects a paycheck to make a living. He doesn't care nor anyone in there. They are negligent, incompetent, inconsiderate, uneducated in management and just plain dumb people. Get your act together. Educate yourself in customer satisfaction, find someone who can teach you how to approach a dissatisfied customer. And for goodness sake grow a sense of humor and don't act like a dead doorknob. Yes I had to get him to take It off and he finally did. But why should I have to call them out for their mistakes.

Keith C.,"Newton, MA",47,224,9,2.0,12/14/2015,"So, staying in the Marlowe, and wanted to grab Sunday Brunch, we didn't want to go outside. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Galeria which is brunch-ish, so we wandered in here. The place was empty, and we were seated pretty quickly. I got the four-cheese gluten-free pasta, and my wife the breakfast omelette. Both plates had a decent taste, but portions were smaller than I'd expected. Not unreasonably so, but normally pasta dishes are pretty sizable because well, they cost nothing to make. Afterwards, we got the only gluten-free cheesecake, which was also good. I would give three stars for this, however there were two main issues. The first was that out waiter said basically nothing, and kinda seemed upset in general? Maybe he was having a bad day, but it was pretty weird. He wasn't unfriendly, just... intensely quiet. He was good about refilling drinks though. The other big issue is that several times during brunch they were doing something that was either vacuuming or blendering or whatever, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear my wife, who was sitting 3 feet away, over the sound of it for several minutes. Very annoying. Short story, food was fine, service was ok-ish, and ambiance was pretty annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40

I sat squirming in my chair for about 10 minutes and made eye contact multiple times with a manager at the host stand who saw me wrenching my neck in an attempt to locate our server. As I squirmed in my chair this manger , who was casually chatting with a few servers st the host stand , made eye contact with me multiple times. It was obvious we were not greeted , we had no drink order , no napkin on our table . He did not do anything to get a server to our table or even acknowledge our growing frustration . If you don't want my business that is fine. We got right up and went across to world of beer for a wonderful lunch. Cheesecake was our first choice but that will never happen again. This Cambridge location is usually empty and dead and I can see why if this is the tone this manager sets. The Braintree location has a line out the door and a long wait on every visit! If Cambridge is getting less customers they should value the few that still want to go in and pay 12 dollars for a cocktail. Greet your guest within a minute of them sitting down ! Basic rule #1!

The hostess was friendly and we only had to wait like 1 minute for seats.  Their menu has a wide selection of food. I ordered a cappuccino as it was cold that day (the cup was huge and it definitely warmed we up). We ordered crab wontons for appetizer and I was surprised it came in such a large portion size. Their breadsticks with butter was delicious (esp the brown bread). We ordered orange chicken and tomato basil pasta which were both delicious and worth the price as it came in huge portion.  Our waiter was friendly and checked in to see if everything was alright and constantly filled our glass with water. Our food came quickly and the presentation was great. Yes it's quite expensive but judging from the size it's worth it. I also suggest sharing food with your friends if you're on a tight budget. We started to get full and didn't get to order their famous cheesecake... But that's something to look forward to in the future.  Also, my friend mentioned how the lighting is pretty dim here as it was difficult to take pics of our food or to even see the food.

Regret B.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2016,"The waitstaff that work the takeout are appalling.  It's not the first time that this has happened which is even worse.  When I call in my order, I have to call back a minimum of 3-5 times and ask for the manager as each time, I get put on endless hold and no-one ever picks up.  Tonight, I called in my order, said I'd be there in 30 minutes. Whoever took my call said the food will be ready and out in 15 minutes.  It took me 40 minutes to get there.   As I was trying to park my car for curbside pickup there was a large SUV which parked over 2 spaces, I called into the restaurant to see if they could run the order out to my car and I would just pay them. However the employee (woman) who answered said, ""Oh, I'm sure that's my ride, I'm on my way out and I'll tell him to move.""  I said ok and waited, 10 minutes later, a woman waddles out and continues to shove bags of food into the back of the car and then squeezed herself into the front seat. Another 5 minutes passes before she and the driver pull out. I park and walk into the takeout area.  There are 2 employees standing behind the takeout counter, one of them fussing with her cell phone and the other plays with rolls of coins in the cash register.  They see me but ignore me and continue NOT to do their job. I walk away to the hostess desk and tell the hostess  that no one acknowledged that I was standing at the takeout area.  The hostess tells me she's going to get the manager and walks me back to the takeout area where the ""coin girl"" decides to acknowledge me, at which point the manager comes up and I repeat the story in front of the ""coin and cell phone girls"" as they stand there and shrug their shoulders.  It was probably 50 minutes now since my initial phone call and my food is no where to be seen.  The manager rushes back to the kitchen and again, I'm left to wait.  After what seems like too many minutes, I leave. I call back 10 minutes later to ask for the regional manager's name and phone number.  The hostess who answers the phone puts me on hold to find the information.  5 minutes later, she answers the phone again, telling me the restaurant manager is busy and can't get that information to me.  I said, "" You're telling me the manager who I just spoke with face to face, is too busy to take my call?  Is that right?""  She responds, ""Well, I....I ....can't really find him, I don't know where he is, I think he's with another guest.""  At which point, I say good bye and hang up. So, if the hostess doesn't know where the manager is, how does she know he's with another guest or busy?.   It seems that no  one in the restaurant knows which way is up.   The service is subpar even for a low-level mass  production franchise restaurant. the employees are juvenile, rude and extremely unprofessional",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40

The soup was cream of wild mushroom, containing shitake mushrooms, it was not to my taste:  rich, strong and intense in flavour, almost like a steak sauce and quite salty. The sandwich was ok, but the salad was limp, with some of the leaves showing signs of decay as they were dissolving, the tomatoes were hard and tasteless. $3 for bottomless fountain drinks seemed a good deal and the waiter kept me topped up.  After the initial delay the waiter returned to my table twice to see if everything was ok, but I felt to awkward to say I didn't enjoy the soup.

There was no one waiting. This was the first time we got seated right away. First, we were a party of two and our hostess wanted to seat us at a table near the front with several other parties. It looked crowded over there. It didn't have any arm room, so we asked to be in a booth. They accommodated us. We get seated. Now, it still doesn't look crowded just a good amount of parties. There was a party of four behind us that was clearly enjoying their selves because we could hear the commotion over our convo. Now our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders. Immediately, she wanted to take our orders from the menu. Mind you, we haven't been in the booth for five minutes yet. She arrives with our drinks in less than two minutes and brings forth our bread. Now, we still haven't looked decided what we wanted because it's only been a minute or two. She asked us if we're ready to order. Now I'm feeling rushed. We don't say anything. We just say we need some time! Anywho, she comes back now and we order our appetizers. Now a party of eight I wanna comes in. They are given full cooperation. They were sitting right across from us. Not only were they not rushed but they we're attended too. minutes before we got the appetizer we were asked about entrees. Now the table was small so I normally don't order my appetizer and entrees so close together. However, we were feeling rushed so we just put them in. We did not see the waitress again. We had to flag her down countless times. She passed by us multiple times not even to look and see if we're we're still living or if our food was to our satisfaction.

S P.,"Saugus, MA",0,4,,1.0,3/30/2017,"ATROCIOUS!!! Never have I ever had the worst dining experience in my entire life up until last night. Our waiter (JOHN) was the utmost disgusting, rudest, and pompous individual I have ever met. He never properly introduced himself when greeting us and never asked us what we wanted for beverages. Instead he assume we wanted water and bread without a peep out of his mouth. I kindly asked for lemon and before I was able to order a cocktail he cut me off and said ""sure, I'll get you lemon"" then quickly left. By that awkward moment my friend and I decided to just settle for water since clearly he couldn't let us order drinks.  When he came back with my lemon he asked us if we were ready to order. I was extremely frustrated, but bit my tongue and ordered. My friend requested if she could have the chicken Bellagio, but instead with the Louisiana chicken and his response ""So you want fried chicken..."" with an unwelcoming tone. This was uncalled for and instead of stating the obvious he could've addressed it politely and with no attitude that way we could of had a better understanding.  Instead of leaving or requesting a new server we decided to deal with his sour personality. We proceeded to order and got 2 appetizers and 1 entree . In the past the server normally asks us if we would like the order to come out together. This man was so quick to cut us off again that we never got a chance to even ask.  He came back to drop off appetizer plates and basically slammed it on our table. He came back to drop off the 2 appetizers and not once asked us how everything was. Then before the entree even arrived he didn't bother to pick up the unused dirty plates. Eventually I just stacked the plates together thinking he could take a hint. Correct me if I am wrong, but EVERY TIME I get pasta they offer parmesan, but no he didn't. We didn't even bother to ask and didn't want to hunt down our waiter who clearly doesn't want to be there.  We barely even spoke to him throughout the entire evening. Again, he never asked us how our entree was either. He came back to the table again to give us water when we didn't need it because our cups were practically full. My friend kindly said ""Sir, would you please remove these plates."" HE CUT HER OFF of course and said ""YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!"" I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn't know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn't even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us.  At this point we couldn't take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend ""Are you still working on that?"" mind you she didn't have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said ""Well what am I working on there's nothing on my plate."" He didn't deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec.  Finally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn't even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn't even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he's a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel.

Rather Be D.,"Cambridge, MA",0,7,,1.0,1/25/2017,"Hi - This was my dining experience.  I was dining alone. I was seated across from the waiter transaction station. The waiter brought me bread with butter. I immediately informed him that I don't eat dairy products and that if they put it in my food I would send it back. I asked him to bring me olive oil. He said ""right away"".  I waited for several minutes and watched him wait on other tables and my bread grow cold. I looked at him as he walked by and he asked me about the weather and if it was still nice out. I reminded him about the olive oil. He had forgotten. Not long thereafter I was served the grilled salmon that I had ordered. It was quite raw in the center. I showed it to the waiter who said that they served their salmon medium rare. I repeated a few times as he kept saying that that it was served medium rare that it was raw. He took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and said it was a mistake and that they would not knowingly serve their food that way. The waiter came by and said they would give me a fresh serving. I waited for a while. Out came salmon drenched in butter, not grilled, and with pesto sauce on it. I had ordered just plain grilled salmon as it is offered on the menu, with nothing on it, and grilled.  The manager returned and denied there was butter on it, said that it was grilled, just some oil from the pesto sauce (which pesto sauce, or butter, was not on my original order.  Given that he was aggressively denying there was anything awry with the order, I said that I didn't want to argue, and just pushed the food away and put my head in my hands, as I was 99% sure that it was butter not oil. Another manager came over and asked if everything was all right. Clearly it wasn't.  I said that I was willing to pay for the meal but I did not trust it and would not eat it. I got my money back.  It is a violation of US health codes to serve uncooked fish and if the kitchen makes a mistake the second time it should not be denied.  I was taking myself out for my birthday.

I could wait.. i would have waited all night if I had to. 10 min later the manager came over and said it would take another 15 min. He apologized, made the mashed potatoes complimentary, and even made one of our entrees complimentary (I did not expect that at all!). We ordered the godiva cheesecake while we waited, then eduardo brought out hot and fresh mashed potatoes in a takeout container.. Not one, but TWO heaping portions! It was the highlight of my day.

I got the coulotte steak (common name ""sirloin"", my childhood favorite!) and it was served on its own plate, while my mash practically came on its own palanquin. At first I wondered why my steak had its own giant plate, and then I saw ALL THE WONDERFUL STEAK JUICES.  The steak alone was very lean and tender, BUT THOSE JUICES!! Oh gosh, it was just the cherry on top of my entrée.  For dessert, the sir and I shared a toasted marshmallow smores cheesecake. I'm a lover of smores in its pure form, so I don't feel like the particular flavor belongs on cheesecake. Still, for a cheesy variation, it was very rich and toasty. The glazing marshmallow was beautifully browned and the cheesecake itself is incredibly rich. Cheesecake Factory quality, definitely. The only thing that was ""off"" about this visit was that my sir's fork had dried spinach or something stuck on the back of it, likely due to rushed dish washing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=60
Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1440,14550,4.0,4/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a new long and skinny menu insert listing their new SkinnyLicious® Menu.  As a lover of variety, I decided to order two of those to make up my evening's meal. We were then asked if we'd like bread and butter - and miss their yummy honey wheat?  Silly question!  But plates were MIA so I ate mine on top of a napkin. WARM ASPARAGUS SALAD $6.95 Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon and Parmesan Cheese, Topped with a Sunny Side Up Egg ROASTED PEAR AND BLUE CHEESE FLATBREAD $6.50 Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions Sound good?  Yup, sounds good.  And they were pretty good, yet petite, though reasonable for the price.  I ate it all though, so a heavier eater would need something more. I also picked up some dessert for later.  A tiramisu cheescake that was light and not too sweet, and their Lemoncello layer cake $7.95.  If you like lemon, and you like your sweets not toooooooo sweet, you just might like this one. 3 stars *** 1/2016 *** We were seated in the bar area shortly after 5:30pm, and lucky us, we discovered that they have a bar menu now!  From 4pm - 6pm on Monday - Fridays, they offer 18 items for $5.50 apiece. The three of us picked a number of dishes to share and had ourselves a good time and meal. . Avocado Eggrolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce $10.95 (regular menu price) . Fried Macaroni and Cheese crispy crumb coated Macaroni and Cheese balls, served over creamy marinara sauce $10.95 . Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke served with a spicy vinaigrette and garlic dip . Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes topped with sour cream, salsa, cilantro, avocado and salsa verde $10.95 . Southern Fried Chicken Sliders crispy fried chicken breast on mini-buns, served with lettuce, tomato and pickles $9.95 . Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip a delicious blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread $11.95 We particularly enjoyed the sweet and savory of the tamale cakes, while finding the fire roasted artichokes a rather messy experience as water dripped down our arms. Five probably would have fit our appetites a bit better along with a loaf or two of their wonderful honey-wheat.  Four if we had planned to save room for a slice or two of their delicious creamy cheesecakes. 4 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=60

Awesome plate of Salmon with Shrimp Scampi and Mashed Potatoes with surprisingly PERFECTLY cooked Zucchini..the Queen had a huge Cobb Salad she couldn't finish..the Egg Roll Sampler with assorted sauce app..damn...as I'm seriously typing right now, I could use some of those...

I also noticed that when I looked at my bank statement there was a little more charged to my account than there should be.

This one though seems to need a new manager - unless I completely misunderstood him. The restaurant was mostly empty.  We walked in the door and the manager greated us tersely - almost like he was ready for a fight. We let him know my wife and I would be meeting our son and asked if we could be seated at a booth if it was available. He let us know it wasn't and had the hostess seat us at a two-person table. A little weird, but we asked to be reseated and, after checking, the hostess seated us at a 4-person. Our waitress was great.  Quickly taking our order and updating it when our son arrived.  Food came out fine and was delicious. But then we ordered dessert. Initially the hostess came and let us know that would be a little longer than normal (10 minutes) because they had to cook new shortbread.  After the 10 minutes went by she came and apologized again and told us it probably be more like 20. After another 20 minutes went by she came and apologized again saying sorry is taking so long.  Finally the manager comes out and says that they burnt the shortbread. He didn't offer an explanation, no offer of a different desert, no apology, no nothing.

However, in my most recent visit there were four people joking around loudly at the hostess stand that were swearing and completely ignoring me for about a minute. Then when I asked for a table for two the host made a joke saying ""nope sorry you're gonna have to sit on the floor"".  Then when we were seated I waited for five minutes without a waiter greeting our table until I asked for help from a random waiter.  During our meal we were right next to a POS station and could hear pretty loudly waiters talking about how customers were being ""cheap"" with tips lately- suggesting the foreign customers were ignoring the sticker in the check books saying that ""it is customary to tip 15-20% in America"".  Then when our check did come the waiter had printed the wrong check - probably a rushed mistake but still just one more part of our experience that was negative.  I want to emphasize that some people that work here are extremely professional and that the food is great.

My son's kids' meal consisted of four tiny chicken strips, not nearly enough for any normal kid to be satisfied. The manager made me feel like I was inventing the problem but if so, why was he stopping by every table in our row? It sucked for everyone. Then the waitress brought me a bill and told me the manager had comped my son's chicken strips, but what was comped was the replacement dish they brought out, even though I hadn't requested one--how generous (eyeroll).

He visited the table next to us, 3 times before finally we flagged him down to take our order. We waited an extremely long time to get our food and when it was served it was barely warm like it waited a long time in the window before being served.  We never did get a refill on our sodas, we asked for our meals to be boxed up. He brought out two boxes and a bag to us, we boxed up our own leftovers.  He then picked up the leftovers at the table behind us and boxed those up in the kitchen for them, and presented them to the couple.  The place was empty, he wasn't busy, the server had three tables with two people at each table.

Kelvin N.,"Bethesda, MD",33,9,,1.0,5/1/2015,"LARGE GROUPS SHOULD AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS. When a restaurant deserves only one star despite serving above-average food, either the service, location, or prices are exceptionally unreasonable. Here, it's the service. THREE confirmations of a single reservation for 30 people were insufficient to convince the manager that the customer really values the reservation, and highly respects the restaurant, knowing how popular and busy it can be. Over the phone, the manager promised 2 tables of 15, only to split us into 4 tables of unequal size all over the restaurant. Actions speak louder than words; how the inability to honor such a concept earned the manager his position is utterly revealing of the restaurant's leadership. Arrogance and complacency do overshadow respect for the customer - this restaurant is an epitome of that.

There were only 4 small pieces of tuna, a much smaller bed of lettuce (and wilted), one slice of tomato and 2 incredibly thin slices of avocado, a big heaping of ginger and then the side of dressing. I noticed they had raised the price by a few dollars as well. I was very disappointed but the waitress insisted this was how it was. Although I told her I've had the dish many times she seemed lost for words and did nothing. I expressed my disappointment later to management and they offered to mail me a voucher in the amount of the dish as they agreed that's not how it was supposed to come out. I never got the voucher. Last time I was here, my bf and I wanted to try two new appetizers, one of which was the chicken pot stickers. He has several food allergies, and asked what was in the chicken pot stickers. The waitress looked at us incredulously and said ""ummm...chicken?"" like we were a bunch of idiots. She looked right at me when I told her we needed to know if there was anything else in there because he has food allergies. She just stood there and stared, so my bf further clarified that sometimes there are other things in pot stickers, like carrots and cabbage, both of which he is allergic to. She finally said ""oh! you should have told me you had allergies! so do you want the pot stickers or do you want me to ask the chef what's in them?"" We obviously wanted to know what's in them, why else would we ask??? Maybe I will return to the Cheesecake Factory for the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, but only if at a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=80

My waiter was very attentive and professional but that was the only decent this tonight. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my first bite there was a bread bag wire in my sandwich that cut my lip. I informed the manager and she asked me if I wanted to keep the sandwich. I declined and she asked me if I wanted to replace it with something else. She left the menu for me to look at and said she would be back to check on me in a few minutes. I waited and she never came. My waiter did return shortly after and took care of my order. We waited an additional 45 minutes for my food so I just asked them to pack it up. ( understandable it is 2 days before Christmas but I was opening they would expedite it for me since I cut my lip due to a wire .. )  So we are in the restaurant for about 2.5 hours now and finally ready to go. I didn't bother eating my meal since my friend was already finished with hers. Our waiter came with our check and guess what? The sandwich was still on my bill including my new order! I asked for a manager and another gentleman came out. He said he would fix this for me right away. I asked him for some sort of discount since I didn't even get to eat my meal and we waited for so long. At first he seemed like he did not want to offer anything but suggested I take a cheese cake home. When I refuse he gave me a look and took my check and said ""I'll see what I can do.""  He ended up removing the sandwich which I returned and removing an appetizer we had ordered previously. He removed the cheapest item instead of removing my replacement meal which I could not even eat. I know it was a busy night but both managers on staff were less then pleasing to deal with.  It's really unfortunate because I do like going to the Cheesecake Factory but I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=100

We tried the Prudential Center Cheesecake Factory first, but that was a 2 1/2 hour wait. Hopped on the T and zipped out here.  Both my wife and I ordered off the SkinnyLicious menu: one veggie burger, which was perfectly edible and one turkey and avocado sandwich, which was actually very good. It was very difficult deciding on the actual cheesecake to order (because we couldn't really justify eating one each). One of us desperately wanted a graham cracker crust, and the other one didn't want too much chocolate. We both love Key Lime pie, but we were not sure if a cheesecake would give us the same flavor.

I ordered the vegetable salad which ended up being teeny tiny pieces of vegetables in the lettuce. I couldn't tell if the asparagus was scallions or actually asparagus. It didn't make sense to me to have a salad w/ such tiny pieces of vegetables that they were barely noticeable. My friend got an omelette which on the other hand was basically like an egg pocket. Instead of her items being incorporated into the eggs it was placed in the middle of the omelette like a hot pocket or something. So we ended up being confused at why her food items (not cut up) were wrapped in egg & mine were all chopped up.

I ended the meal with a yummy chocolate cake and my son had the strawberry shortcake.   Our waitress was very good.  She was upbeat, and attentive without being annoying.  The restaurant is noisy, but we were seated in a booth near the kitchen and it felt like we were sort of in an insulated area.

I understand a lot if things being in the industry especially screwing things up from time to time but as a server you should know that kids eat first and as a manager you deliver the kids food yourself and either take the thing off the bill since you know it's been an hour for a kids pizza to come out and since you know your service is bad.

However, it has been awhile so I thought I would give them another chance. Sorry I did! I won't make that mistake again. The restaurant was freezing cold to start with.  But, lucky I had a jacket with me. As it is late September in Mass. The staff was nice, hostesses and my server Paco.  Though other than my server Paco, no one said anything about my horrible experience. Never saw a manager. I ordered the Ahi Tartar , it was really good. less than 400 calories as well. Then I Ordered a mushroom burger,with sweet potato fries. ( you pay extra for sweet potato fries.) Paco asked me how I wanted the burger cooked, I always get it well done, because, as we all know E coli lurks in ground beef. Especially at a chain that probably gets its' meat from CON AGRA.    When it came out, my 10 fries were over cooked and very dry, but that was not my complaint. My issue was the burger.  First it was laden with mayo. After I scrapped all thought off, I cut the burger in half only to see the meat was raw inside. Not even rare!  It really scared me.    Thank You Jesus that I had not bitten into it. I showed Paco my burger, He offered 2xs to send it back. I declined because, you never send food back to the Kitchen. Not if you want to eat it. Any way, I just thought I would take it with me and cook it later .    Paco did give me a dessert of my choice for my inconvenience. I got a blueberry cheesecake.  It too was horrible. They are not like real cheesecake , it is all processed ingredients you can taste it.  Whipped cream is also processed. I would think for nearly $8.00 a slice, it should be real.   By the way I did ask if they had gluten free rolls for the Burger, they did not . No gluten free products at all. The place is busy and I don't get it. It is just not good.  Prices are high as well. I never mind spending $$ if it is good.   Sorry , but Cheesecake factory is not.

Cabbage was used as the lettuce, but they used the hard white part of it. It felt like eating cold cow hide. The beans were gritty and hard and the rice boasts of zero flavor. Bad choice on the menu. I should have just stuck with a burger. Our server Christopher was a really cool guy. He took our requests (extra bread, lemons, sour cream) seriously and delivered promptly. I ordered the crab cake bites, and he accidentally ordered the full priced ones. With a sight hesitation of wanting to speak up, I decided to call it to his attention, anyway.

Not true, because even the veggie things are cooked in chicken broth. :-(. We ended up ordering fried zuccini, artichoke hearts, avocado egg rolls, pizzette and huevos rancheros. The food was all OK quality and greasy. For drinks we got coke and raspberry lemonade (which was VERY tart). The only saving grace for the dinner was their bread.

I used to work in this mall for a good 4+ years, and my co-workers and I would go down every Friday night after closing and have drinks and food. The best thing I can say is that though inconsistent, it is pretty solid. I mean, if we really didn't like it, would we continue to go there week after week? If you've ever been to a CF before, you know the deal -- HUGE portions, fast service, friendly waitstaff.  One thing that I feel is often overlooked is their mixed drink menu. Awesome selection! Some really great and unique cocktails (especially if you're a girly-girl like me and like sweeter, fruit-infused drinks), all of which are delicious.  The cheesecake is, for the most part, to die for. Some of the flavors don't really fancy me, and I've come across a few that fall into the ""too"" category -- too sweet, too cheesy, too fruity, too chocolatey, etc. But, I've found a few that I consistently love -- the pumpkin pie cheesecake (this is seasonal), the banana cream cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and red velvet cheesecake. You can never go wrong with any of those. Some other dishes that I like and have been consistently good -- the sliders, chicken taquitos, chicken madeira, steak diane, hibachi steak, and one of my all-time favorites, pasta da vinci.

Dan C.,"Cambridge, MA",602,303,23,3.0,1/17/2013,"Confession time, I've been here twice in the last two weeks.  Once with my Dad as it is his favorite restaurant, and once with friends because up until a week ago many of us hadn't been here in years. This is one of those places that people probably aren't using yelp for unless they've been frozen in carbonite for the last 20 years because these days kids come out of the womb knowing what the Cheesecake Factory is.  Why this place is packed all the time is beyond me...well it probably has something to do with the massive portions, infinitely long menu, and saccharine drinks. Would I bring a date here? Hell no--it has about as much personality as a boiled ham.  Would I go here if a bunch of people all wanted to get dinner but were each insistent on pizza, pasta, Chinese, classic American, Southern, etc and all want it to taste exactly the same? Yes, I would.  The menu is like a compendium of food that has existed around the world and throughout time.  Its 21 pages of random things that people may or may not have thrown together after getting stoned. Food: 21 pages of chicken.  Goddamn people must eat a lot of chicken.  When I went here with my Dad he got a cajun pasta and I got what they told me was ""their take"" on chicken parm.  How someone has a take on chicken parm is beyond me, if you make chicken parm, its chicken parm, end of story.  Anyways, both of your dishes tasted exactly the same, but you should expect that from a place which is loved by soccer moms the world over.  When I went with friends I had a burger (doesn't matter which one since they all taste the same) and an order of the guacamole...which the waiter said we could get extra spicy, so we did.  The guac was quite possibly the least spicy thing ever conceived by man.  The burger was huge and cooked to order so I can't complain about that, though it's probably more food than should be in a person at a time.  I had the pineapple upside-down cheesecake, which turned out to be one of the worse decisions I've made as of late (and trust me, I've made some bad decisions lately).  Their super dense cheesecake sandwiched between two cold blocks of cake with the density of diamonds.  Oh, if you're curious, look up the calories for the dishes...you won't be that surprised. Drinks: I asked the waitress if I could get a Gimlet and she gave me a look like I told her the ending to Titanic.  So I decided to stick to the menu.  The Firefly, long island, and the mojitos are incredibly sweet, so if you actually like the taste of your liquor, then hold off. Service: Amazing service.  Way to go 20 year old girl and guy with awesome hair who's been there for 7 years, you're what made this place awesome for me.  The waiters can take you front to back then front again through the menu while blindfolded and lit on fire. Bottom Line: You really don't want to go here because there are so many great little places in this city we call Boston, but if you're at the mall and your options are this place or PF Changs, good God, go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=200

I simply asked for a new syrup which by the time I received it, my food was already cold. Again the syrup was essentially water and our waitress responded that it's all they have and it's made early in the morning. So I sent my food back and was not offered another option. At this point my boyfriend still hadn't eaten his food, which was also cold. The manager DENISE approached our table and was incredibly rude telling me that I was wrong that it was syrup. Again didn't offer me anything else. I asked for the check, which was brought back with my boyfriend's meal still on it (which was not eaten). I politely explained that we shouldn't be charged as he was not intending on eating. The manager Denise started yelling and then stormed off without letting us get a word in edgewise. My boyfriend simply under his breath said ""what the fuck"" and the manager happened to hear in passing. She told us to get out, and don't come back, proceeding to call MALL SECURITY on us.

Michelle J.,"Boston, MA",92,51,1,2.0,2/19/2012,"For some reason, the Cheesecake Factory chain has built up a good amount of hype for itself--particularly amongst out-of-towner suburbanites.  If it weren't for my family's love of this place, I'd probably never have stepped foot in here a second time.   TCF tries to be all things for all people, and herein lies its main failure.  It is a jack of all foods, master of none.   In no way is it necessary for a menu to be 15+ pages long.   While I appreciate my ability to order a Thai lettuce wrap, a fried macaroni and cheese ball ""Glamburger"" (WTF is a GLAMBURGER? WTF are fried mac n' cheese balls?), Baja chicken tacos, BBQ salmon, etc. all from the same place, I am overwhelmed and even turned off by the sheer number of choices.  After all, if the cooks need to maintain that huge of a repertoire, how are they possibly going to do them well?  There is a very good reason why the best of the best restaurants only offer a few items on the menu.  I'm not saying TCF has to be best of the best, but some restraint would be welcome.  Even more of a turn-off than the long menu are the full page advertisements on every other page of said menu.  Cheesecake F. presents itself as a classy date gig--but it really isn't that classy to pick out your Chicken Madeira while simultaneously discovering the best place to get hair electrolysis.  Stay classy, TCF.  You really know how to set the dining mood.  When you first arrive at TCF, you gather like hungry anxious cattle in the waiting area, hoping your table will be called sometime in the next century.  A 25 minute wait is not even the norm for a Friday/Saturday night--most of the time you are looking at waits upwards of 40-45 minutes.   But TCF will not take reservations, either, so really the only time it makes sense to come here is when nobody in your party is actually hungry.  Gee, that makes a whole lot of sense.   I don't have much to say about the food itself except for every meal I've ever ordered here requires a heavy dose of salt and pepper before it actually starts to taste like food.   You would think the cheesecake factory's one redeeming quality would be its cheesecake.  But alas, even the cheesecake kind of sucks at the Cheesecake Factory.  Again, too many options and they all basically end up tasting the same.  You can almost  taste the conveyor-belt uninspired uniformity of every slice.  I dare say that the frozen cheesecakes in the grocery store satisfy my cheesecake cravings more.   One star for the whole wheat bread, which is the only thing I've ever actually enjoyed here, and one star for the dish presentation which showed some attention to detail.  That's as generous as i can be.   One last thought--when I go to restaurants like TCF, which are notorious for having 1200 calorie + entrees, I typically look for something that might count as ""lighter fare.""  TCF has this really embarrassing way of highlighting all the low-cal options on its ""Skinnylicious"" menu. OK, just because I'm trying to eat healthier doesn't mean I like to shout over the din that I'd like to order the ""Skinnylicious grilled salmon.""  Between the ""Glamburgers"" and the ""Skinnylicious salads,"" i'm starting to think that Paris Hilton inspired this menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220

So yeah, I was left to choose from places like TGIFridays, Ruby Tuesday's, etc.  Kind of a Hobson's Choice if there ever was one.  I went with Cheesecake Factory, kind of grimly curious to see the substance behind stories of 1500 calorie salads and deep fried macaroni.  The environment was more cavernous than I expected, and about as bright as as one too.  At one point during dinner the lights inexplicably became quite bright, then faded back to dimness.  The decor was kind of odd to say the least, we couldn't decide if it was faux-Egyptian, Mayan, Roman, or other. One friend and I split the fish tacos and the Clubhouse salad.  The picky friend got the chicken medallions.  The white fish on the tacos were surprisingly good, but the tempura batter had a taste of rancid fry-oil aftertaste.  The tacos became tastier when we added some ranch dressing to them.  They also came with a somewhat bland side of dirty rice and beans, in a cast iron dish.  At 14 dollars for 4 tacos, however, I was not impressed. The Clubhouse Salad was not the disgustilicious dish I was hoping for but was rather a decent salad with a rather odd addition of cubed cheddar in addition to the cheddar shreds.  Regardless, the salad was kind of decent, in no way seemed healthy, but left us full (it was apparently only about 1100 calories).  The picky friend's dish was, after her requested alterations, a large pile of white rice and 3 or 4 pieces of plain grilled chicken, plus an order of diet coke, of course.  She seemed satisfied. The service was perfectly fine, diet coke refilled, and it was explained the gluten-free menu was currently unavailable this week but would be back soon.

I really don't like this place and I don't know why I keep going back!! That all being said, the food is good and pretty consistent among the 3 or 4 different stores I've been to. The prices are outrageous and definitely not worth it. The cheesecake is just okay. I've had so much better and I hate that they have so many to choose from. As a matter of fact, I hate that the menu is as large as it is. It's annotying to have to flip through so many food choices and a lot of them look the same. The service... I've actually decided to write this review because of my last experience here. I came with a group of maybe 10 or more and everyone ordered a lot of food. Our server was nice though she left us hanging for awhile - be it to take our order, bring our bread, refill water, ask how we're doing, etc. She was nice to us and I know large groups can get crazy. Our entrees were starting to come out and the guy bringing them out was the biggest dick I've ever seen. He came over and screamed with an attitude that the plate was hot so don't touch it, okay?! Condesendingly he said, 'okay?!' again. As we were trying to make room for our food, he was yelling that we had to move more plates out of the way if we wanted our food, he rolled his eyes, snarled, yelled about moving more things out of the way, and slammed things down onto the table. As one of my friend's was moving a plate, he sntached it out of her hand and moved it himself.  I really wish I had said something, but I was having a good time with friends and didn't want to ruin our evening. As I was driving to the restaurant, I saw this guy smoking near the loading dock  on the side of the mall and thought about how disgusting it was to see him smoking right on the street. I knew he worked there from the white gear (anyone know why they have to wear ALL white?? That's gross, too) and hoped he wouldn't be our server.

We went in today for lunch ( he brought me to make me happy) but probably will never go back.  We got our food (mine was fine) he got a baked potato soup. He thought he didn't feel good because we hadn't ate till almost 3pm and went outside for air. When he came back in he started in on his soup again. Not a minute after he was holding his water glass up over his mouth. I yelled "" if you're going to throw up run to the bathroom!"" and he did.... And he puked. That was the signal to leave so we got our salads to go and left.  When we were there he made it very well known he has a severe apple allergie and asked for his salad with out it. The waitress assured us that there would be no apple in his chopped salad. Just now we dig into our leftovers. We had asked for dressing but were given none. He takes a bite and 20 seconds he starts coughing and runs to the sink. What was in it??? APPLE. So for the last ten mins he's been drinking milk and has taken benedryl. Luckily it was only one bite. One more and we could be heading to the er right now. His allergy is so severe that his throat can close.

I paid the bills and we finished eating because we stlll weren't done, she tried to clear the plates while my friend was still cutting her mac ball.. she brings back the bills and I sign and we are getting ready to leave and she comes running over flustered saying she needed my credit card again because she voided the Transaction, I handed over my card reluctantly and asked how i know I am not being charged twice, she said you aren't you will see on your statement..... but if you see your charged twice CCF will refund you REALLY!?!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240

When the Factory first opened, I was young and impressed - quasi fusion dishes, seemingly funky decor... But now, the love affair has ended and even the once noteworthy cheesecake tastes chain-y. First, quite simply this place is overpriced (even if the rumors are true and they give diners 1 lb. & a 1/4 of pasta). 10 dollars for a slice of cheesecake? That's ridiculous. Go to an Italian community and buy a whole cheesecakefor the same price! Next, the food is TOO oily - I'm talking Paula Deen here folks!  I had the Evelyn pasta at Thanksgiving time, and some pesto dish right before Christmas. The Evelyn dish was bland and grease-filled. The pasta itself was a little too al dente and it appeared dessicated, as if had been under the warmer too long. The most recent time, with the pesto dish, there was so much oil that I had to put paper napkins in my plate to absorb the excess! Of course, I should have spoken up. However, the waiter walked by twice and blithely pretended not to notice. On a side note, there was a little verbal spat between two of the waitstaff.

All signs point to the CF. Helpful hint if you've never been there: it's a good idea to know what you might be in the mood for before you get there because the menu will overwhelm you and you'll order in haste and the whole enterprise will be roo-eened. Friends recommended the fried mac & cheese appetizer and I'm glad they steered me in that direction. What you get are four of these crispy, salty, creamy bombs of deep-fried artery busting food art arranged on a platter of better-than-average, eat-with-a fork-marinara. The were so rich I could only eat one, but they were just as good warmed up the next day. Also: nachos. I am very picky about my nachos, and I know I'm always risking disappointment when I order from a new place, but our server said they were good so we went for it. I must say, well played, Cheesecake Factory. Their 'chos are nothing fancy, just a solid example to show to places that insist on stacking up the dry chips. What is that? CF does the one-layer method, every chip enrobed in baked cheese, studded with jalapenos and served with a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream, plus salsa on the side. They're also quite voluminous.  The Cheesecake Factory does not boast an impressive beer list, but a 22 oz.

I am not sure what road they were trying to go with the menu but they have almost every type of cuisine on there.  The Chinese chicken salad at 500 calories is quite filling and good.  The shepherd's pie was filling, savory, and enjoyable.  There was one dish that I had which was NOT good but I cannot remember (or chose to forget) what it was now. However, my favorite meal here is (surprise) the turkey club!  It is huge and has layers of deliciousness, like bacon.  The fries are also quite good and crisp.  I love clubs and this is probably one of my favorites.  The cheesecake is good - not great, but good.  The prices are expensive and a Grey Goose dirty martini can run you $12 or $14 apiece!  Also, this particular restaurant served me a Bloody Mary with a fly in caught in the celery - they comped it but gross.

Barbara Ann B.,"Arlington, MA",124,21,2,1.0,8/1/2008,"I also lived through the ""Yelpers & The Cheesecake Factory"" ordeal, but I have a bit of a different story to tell.  I was so happy to find out that a Yelp event was happening on a Wednesday because that's the day that I have a sitter because I work late.  I finished up most of my work and hooked up with the crew at Cafe Rustica at the very end of office hours knowing that atleast some of us were heading to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake (and make quite a bit of it) and I have always loved the food at Cheesecake Factory.  So when we get there and there is an estimated 2 hour wait, I decide to go back to work while everyone is waiting to finish up and have them call me when our table was ready because I only work 10 minutes away. I go back to work and work for more than an hour, stop by Devon's to drop off some things that I had for her and the call from Ligaya comes that says that the table is almost ready. So I dart over to the Mall and I get a text from Becki saying that they are seated as I pull into the garage.   Cool, I have managed not to have to wait 2 hours for a table, my work was done so I can relax for a bit and hopefully get out of there within an hour or so and pick my son up in Roxbury by 11. How long could it take for them to serve pre-made, Pre-sliced cheesecake.  Some people ordered drinks, I think the table ordered one app total (at least that was all that I saw being brought to the table) but most of us just ordered cheesecake. I was told by my sitter that I could only stay out so late if I brought her back some cheesecake, so when I ordered I ordered one slice to go (at the regular price) and one slice for me to enjoy with my Yelp friends. After a while, I think at about the same time the app came to the table, a waiter came over with my to go slice of cheesecake. Cool, we will be served soon, right? After about 45 minutes of staring at my to go container of cheese cake, the Yelpers are wanting me to fork it over. But I can't, it's for Ann Marie!  I predict they have run out of cheesecake and they are waiting for the frozen cheesecakes to thaw before they serve us. So I decide to go over and find out what the hold up is and see if they can make my other slice of cheesecake to go also because I have to leave and pick up my son and it's already after 11. When I walk up, I see several people behind the counter with a few slices of cheesecake and not much happening. I ask what's going on and someone says, ""we are very busy and the only thing that people are ordering is Cheesecake and we are doing our best to get the Cheesecake out to your table"" I explained that I had to leave and was told that it would be out shortly.  One of the people behind the counter asked what I was waiting for so they could try to get it out first but the other woman cut her off and said ""They decided to have this big promotion today and we have 4 people working and all of these tables to serve, your food will be out shortly"" and I looked for the other woman who was trying to help get mine so that I could leave but she wasn't there anymore. I go back to the table thinking shortly, I can deal with shortly but we wait and wait and still no cheesecake. I am getting very annoyed because I know how long it takes to put a piece of cut cheesecake on a plate and put some whipped cream on it. If you have 4 people doing it, one person gets the cheesecake, one person plates the cheesecake, one person garnishes with whipped cream and one person makes sure the order is right and passes on to the server. There is no cutting involved, it doesn't really matter how many slices you have to serve in a night.  If you run out, go back to the table and say ""I am sorry, we have run out of the chocolate, can I offer you something else""  I hit my boiling point because I was too deep into it to just walk out empty handed, I was past the point of no return it is now almost Midnight and I want my $1.50 cheesecake!! Give it to me so I can leave!!! One of the yelpers gets up to go to the ladies room and comes back and says there's no TP, I stood up again and said that there will be TP in there shortly (because, damn it I have to pee too) and i get up to go tell one of the people that are standing around chatting, that they need TP in the ladies room but I was headed off by the woman who told me that our food would be out shortly.  She had two plates with cheesecake in her hand and she was walking in our direction and said ""it's coming, it's coming"" so I go sit down (funny, how l no longer need to pee so bad) and she walks right by our table, WTF! A few minutes later our cheesecake actually comes and I wolf down a few bites and throw the rest into one of my take out containers (I had two because they put the strawberries on the side) handed Becki some cash, said a quick Bye and Ran! I got to my son at 12:45, I was in Big Trouble! Thanks CCF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260
Marc C.,"Boston, MA",176,110,29,1.0,7/31/2008,"*UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, I refuse to credit them for our humor... ________ I apologize ahead for length, but it needed to be covered (I guarantee - my longest review ever). Here's some basic math equations for this visit: Entire experience - my fellow diners + time involved = EPIC FAIL! Entire experience + [my fellow diners + Visit to Dante's + time involved  (absurdity +lack of attentiveness +lack of manager response)] x booze x laughter = the only reason that this review gets 2 stars  OK , well that and the fact that I am unable to give a zero... Our group decided that we need to go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheesecake Day with $1.50 slices of cheesecake. You would think they would be prepared, but I digress... So we all arrive at the restaurant with a party of 16. We are given a quoted wait time (after an agitated sigh from the hostess- ever so welcoming) of 2 hours... no problem, expected... change the number to 12, quoted a wait time of 1 1/2-2 hours. The bar didn't have space for us, so we decide to skip (almost literally) over to Dante's across the street for fun, frivolity, and alcohol. The pager wouldn't work over there so our quick thinking leader gives a phone number to call us so we can relax in comfort (this isn't a review for Dante's so I'll skip that). After 2 hours we head back to CF and finally get seated at the 2 1/2 hour mark.  The server (Paco) was nice and friendly got the food and drink orders. Two more people showed while he is taking orders, no problem, the table next to us left and it was added. Took a little while to get the drinks, but no problem. My martini was room temperature and I did not get the side of rocks I requested... ok, larger group, I'll deal. So we ordered drinks, 1 appetizer, and 13 (that should have been an omen, guys) slices of cheesecake for here, 2 to go. Server comes back, they are out of the appetizer ordered- no problem, ordered a different Appetizer which came out in about 10-15 minutes. Then we waited... And laughed with each other and waited... The two to go slices arrive... And laughed with each other and waited (notice a pattern)... Look around, tables seated after us got their food and desserts... and all the servers are sitting around the front of the restaurant chatting away. Meanwhile no drink refills were offered and most of us ran out of water (those that did actually did have water poured some of theirs into their neighbors empty glasses). We actually felt we were not being attended to because the server knew the gratuity would be added to the party. One of us gets up and informs the manager of our situation as we sit in the near empty dining room. Server comes back, I ask for water refills, they are refilled within 5 minutes. And we laughed with each other and waited (at this point for over an hour)... Another member informs the manager we still don't have our cheesecake. Another server comes by and tells us there are only four people working in the dessert pantry (I have been in the business for 20 years and know that is insufficient for this night), OK, how about planning ahead?  And we laughed with each other and waited... Finally, after 1 hour and 25 minutes of being seated, the cheesecake arrives. Delirious to see the Holy Grail of our quest, we dig in... it was good, although two of them were still frozen, but we dealt with it. Besides the restaurant was nearly empty and they were mopping around us- bathroom trip and exit from restaurant included sliding feet-- how about clean water, wet floor signs, and waiting until guests leave next time). I did not order a second drink since I was already over it. We get the bill, nothing was adjusted, but the gratuity was still added (of course). It also would have been nice if the manager visited the table and at least acknowledged the problem. The kicker after we paid? The server (Paco) came over and confronting us about speaking to the manager and stated that she yelled at the servers in front of their gossip gathering. He also stated that they ran out of cheesecakes... hello... planning ahead? Or how about letting us know so we can select another instead of frozen ones? Summary thus far: 4 1/2+ hour cheesecake, good but not that good.  Second kicker? We got out so late the subway stopped running and the car was locked in the parking garage and we had to get a security guard zipping around on a Segway to let us out. So if you want to go next year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day, I suggest the following alternative- July is also National: July Belongs to Blueberries Month, Ice Cream Month, National Baked Beans Month (feel free to make the beans yourself from scratch- you'd still get them faster than the cheesecake...) As for me, next year, I may wait for 08 Aug and celebrate National Sneak Some Zucchini on Your Neighbor's Porch Night (I swear I did not just make that up) with the great people I dined with...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260

Leighann F.,"New York, NY",3243,961,695,2.0,7/31/2008,"Recently added to my list of things that one should never admit in public: I waited a total of 4.5 hours to eat a $1.50 slice of cheesecake. From a chain restaurant. In honor of National Cheesecake Day. Before I hang my head i shame, I must say that the cost/benefit analysis of this experience was only positive because these 4.5 hours were spent with some fabulous yelpers and a bit of alcohol. Two and a half hours total waiting time for a table (which was spent sipping cocktails at Dante across the street) and another two hours waiting for the cheesecakes to arrive to our table!  I WISH I was kidding you. Now, I understand that this promotional deal probably caused quite the hullabaloo for the staff at Cheesecake and a table of fourteen threw just another wrench into the mix, but seriously...TWO HOURS for a slice of cheesecake?  Two hours when other tables that sat after us got their slices way before us? Two hours when your entire staff is standing up at the dessert counter goofing off and completely ignoring our table because we met the requirements for auto-gratuity and they were going to get their tip no matter what?! I assume that this corporate promotion was well planned and each chain was well-informed of this event long ago, so my question is how on earth are you not better prepared? Which in turn leads me to recall another list: Reasons why I do not frequent chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260
Ricky R.,"Austin, TX",38,13,,1.0,7/31/2008,"As all my National Cheesecake Day cohorts have already weighed in on the lengthy fiasco, I feel compelled to opine on the matter myself.  Also because I am told one must review something to be considered a ""yelper.""  But I digress.  On most days, Cheesecake Factory is not a single star establishment.  National Cheesecake Day is not most days. You might think that a factory which turns out cheesecake would be equipped to handle the wave of pilgrims on cheesecake's holiest of days.  You would be mistaken.  You might think that the departure of all the other restaurant patrons (having already been served and finished their meals) would cause your cheesecakes to appear.  Again, you would be mistaken.  You might think that that after being ignored for about an hour the wait staff would eschew sass in favor of a kind, conciliatory tone.  You would again be mistaken.  You might even think that they would throw in an extra slice or sing as song as though it were your birthday with the cheesecakes finally do arrive.  Sadly, you would be mistaken yet again. I won't get into the minutiae of the evening, as that has been more eloquently done by others, so I'll sum up my review as follows: Start with 5 stars for $1.50 slice of cheesecake, subtract 1 star for every hour it takes to get said cheesecake.  In our case, this leaves you with 1 star.  (If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt and not count the wait time for the table, then take off those other two stars anyway for their lack of compassion.) As mentioned elsewhere, the company of the yelpers and the merriment that was made was a 5-star affair.  The Factory had little to do with this, however, so they're still stuck with 1.

Every experience I've ever had with the Cheesecake Factory has involved waiting.  I don't know if they invented the little vibrating pagers, but they've taken their use to an almost sadistic level.  I used to work at a bookstore in a mall next to a Cheesecake Factory, and I guarantee that 60% of our sales during dinner time were from people waiting for their table at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, the food is pretty good.  Yes, those avocado egg rolls are AMAZING.  Yes, some people have developed romantic relationships with the cheesecake.  But after my last visit involved  over four hours of waiting for a single slice of cheesecake, I think takeout is now the only acceptable form of dining at the Cheesecake Factory.

Tell them no, hell no, what are you, a smelly European. Then after you get your lunch, finish every bite on the plate, and finish off with a signature slice of not-very-good cheesecake. Now, go home, it's hot outside, and take a nice nap. You'll need it after the long drive to the mall. Then repeat this process each day for a month. Don't worry, the Cheesecake Factory has over 20,000 different entree's to choose from. Their menu is so long they had to include advertisements.

I think both parts of my personality were tested last night when 11 other Yelpers, plus a few friends... ventured here for National Cheesecake day. Mind you, we get there... find out it's a 2 hour wait, and consider the possibility of just buying whole cheesecakes, and go out somewhere else to eat them. Roni and I check out the scene, but we quickly realize that a $45 cheesecake/12 = $3.75 per person.... and we want our $1.50 cheesecake damnit! So, by choice we keep our name down for the 2+ hour wait, head to Dante for some drinks (about $10 for one), and then head back to Cheesecake factory for our $1.50 slice ... which took for-ev-er to arrive. To the Cheesecake Factory for next years Cheesecake day - be more prepared. The lack of staff that you had on hand was highly disappointing. Next time, screw the $1.50 slice - which ended up costing me way more than the $3.75 when you throw in the alcohol at the other venue while we waited - I'll be down for getting the whole cheesecake and popping a squat for an impromptu picnic.

Try not to go there on weekends because it gets really packed and the service is really slow. The scene is mostly college kids. The decor is pretty amazing. ...I'd say! Your day starts off by the waiter asking what you would like to drink, and if you don't already know what you want to eat prepare to be stuck looking at the menu for 20 extra minutes before he or she comes back to ask if your ready. I mean, the prices aren't that bad. Depends what your getting... The burgers are huge! My favorite was the bacon bbq cheesebuger ($10.98 if i can recall) My mouth waters from the thought of it .. ooh the delight!  Their meals are very quick to fill you up on an empty stomach. But I'd say very fattening...(not good for anyone on a diet) Only thing that I don't like about their burgers is the cheese. (sorta plastic for some reason)  But any who, the fries were great, and my waiter was so sweet I had to give a good tip. =-] I work at the mall so I've been in and out a few times, WARNING. ordering to go is the worst on weekends!

Welton B.,"Saugus, MA",3,47,,1.0,5/29/2008,"Food like this should never cost money. This is dreck. I've been there twice: the first time for a salad, which was approaching mediocre but couldn't quite make it; the second time for fish tacos, which were a complete abomination, and an insult to every foodstuff included, not to mention the intended victim--me. A week ago I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego at Rubio's--a cheap fast-food joint that serves fish tacos. I liked them. So I tried them when I got back to Cambridge, and figured I'd try 'em at TCF--at 4 times the price, they should be at least decent, right? WRONG! The tortillas, which for some odd reason were doubled on each taco, tasted bland, there was WAY too much unseasoned cabbage (about 80% of the filling, by my estimate), and at the bottom was some oddly tasteless fish that had some kind of coloring that one would think might be seasoning. But one would be wrong. It has to just be food coloring. There was ""pico de gallo"" on the side, consisting of diced tomatoes and nothing else (God save us from anything like seasoning or spice!), along with a lump of what they consider guacamole--presumably a lump of old library paste that had green food coloring added and a couple of pencil erasers. This was one of the blandest meals I've ever had... oh, and another thing, there was a drop of special sauce in each of the tacos--I know, because that one drop that was supplied fell on my shirt, where I got a chance to taste it. It wasn't bad. But what's with the rationing? Are we having a national fish taco sauce shortage? Did I not have enough rationing stamps? The meal came with rice (yellow minute rice with bird's eye vegetable bits thrown in) and black beans (possibly the high point of the meal--not too much to screw up between the can and the plate). To sum up, the food tastes awful, the service is unusually busy, and hence have no time for actual individual interaction with customers, and the prices are outlandish.

Stephanie H.,"Salem, MA",83,406,,3.0,3/2/2008,"Went here for breakfast this morning. I love the selection of food they have. My sister and I got there soon after they started serving breakfast, around 10am. We were seated at a two person booth type table in the bar area. The place wasn't busy at all. I think it was due to getting there so early. The breakfast menu has changed since the last time I went for breakfast= but it was still good and filling. The orange juice is half pulp which I HATE! That is why I gave it three stars instead of 4. The other reason I didn't give it a full five stars is due to the fact that the waitress, who was friendly enough ,seemed to be in a rush to get us out of there. During the hour we were there, the place didn't even have any sort of wait that I have normally seen it have during peak lunch or dinner hours so I don't know what the rush was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=320

Chrissy H.,"Portland, ME",180,328,116,3.0,1/14/2007,"When shopping in the Cambridgeside galleria, bring a little extra money and a bit of extra time to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The food court at the mall leaves little to be desired and no where else can you find the yummy warm oatmeal bread the CCF serves before your meal. (you also get a little loaf of sourdough) The portions of everything are so huge and the price is so medium. I advise ordering an appetizer for a meal or splitting an entree. Even the salads are gigantic! You basically get an entire garden. The menu is actually a short book of cocktails (I like the peach Bellini,) appetizers (the sweet tamale corn cakes are to die for,) salads (even the plain garden salad is tasty,) entrees (chicken stuffed tortillas are so bomb,) and of course cheesecake (I enjoy the strawberry cheesecake or the Linda's fudge cake.) Just remember that if you just can't stuff anymore food into your belly, you can always have dessert to go. A few things to keep in mind when dining at CCF:      Expect a wait. It's by far the most popular establishment in the mall so you can expect to be on at least a 30 minute waiting list during peak dining hours.      Expect to spend quite a bit of money if you order alcoholic beverages and dessert because they are not cheap and add up fast!     Be aware that the waitstaff isn't always top notch but you'll always get your food in a timely manner. The one time we didn't, the manager came by and picked up the check for us.     And if you work or live in or near the mall you can always order take out. You might have to hold for 5 minutes before someone takes your order but it's worth it. If you order a beverage on take out, make sure they remember to give it to you because they have forgotten mine on multiple occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=320

You have to wait forever, yes, but at least at this location you can browse around the mall while you wait.  The menu is huge so no matter who you are with, someone will find something they can eat and at a very fair price. Vegans, vegetarians, carnivores, kids, adults, teens, etc they will all be able to find something on the menu. Personally I feel as if a lot of their items are too bland and soggy, but for the price, amount of food, and fact that it's a chain, it's not all that bad. I kept hearing about how good their steaks were and finally tried one. It was very good. the mashed potatoes were also yummy. I got the surf and turf another time (steak and salmon) which was also very good. Stay away from the soggy fish tacos and most of the pastas are overcooked and blah. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so me saying I don't like it here doesn't really mean much, but I'll say it anyway.

I rarely get an appetizer or dessert for that matter.  I always bring the dessert home instead of eating it in the restaurant because i'm usually too stuffed from the bread and entree. My favorites are the Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/chicken & roasted garlic.  Love them!  I've only had one bad meal there and it was the meatloaf.  Not your typical meatloaf and i learned my lesson, so now i order with caution. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer is amazing but i think i felt my heart stop mid-bite.  Not for the health conscious. Note: I'm not sure if anyone else will agree, but i've gotten take-out here several times and it NEVER tastes as good as when i dine-in.  The food always tastes much blander.  I don't get it, but it's a bummer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=320

If you have any problem, I'm sure that management will be eager to get it resolved.  As far as the food goes, its above average. They have all these different ethnic choices - wide ranging - and some are pretty decent. In my time there, I tried everything. I liked the tuna tataki salad - a bit steep price wise, but really great. I've sought out something that comes close but its really actually great. The Thai Chicken Pasta is pretty decent too for a non-Thai joint.  Also, they have some good drinks - the frozen iced mango and frozen iced raspberry are awesome.

If you want dinner, they serve past midnight, so they're great for a late night snack or dinner post party munchies.  The salads are good. The kobe beef burger was pretty good. The navajo sandwich was OK. The guacamole chips were amazing, but the salsa sucked. Can't go wrong with the tasty drinks.  The service is usually pretty good. The waiters/waitresses pay a lot of attention to you and are pretty friendly and chatty.  How to get there? Take the green line Lechmere train, 69 bus, or drive. There's street parking and INEXPENSIVE mall parking in the garage. Take a romantic stroll by the Charles before or after. It's pretty.  Want to avoid the crowds?

Well, after having just gone on a world class eating binge in New Orleans, I was in need of some dietary management. So yes, I sheepishly ordered one of these salads and it was actually pretty good. Spicy chicken, black beans, lots of fresh greens etc. But, I couldn't really enjoy it. I was too pissed off that I was eating something called a ""Weight Management"" salad when I don't have a weight problem!

Ryan R.,"Beverly, MA",7,19,1,1.0,5/26/2007,"I actually like Cheesecake factory, as other people have said, chain restaurants arent normally my thing, but its ok.  This particular one though, awful.  It scored low in just about every category a restaurant can, wait staff, food quality / quantity, interior design, general company, any others I should mention? To start with the wait staff, they were completely ridiculous.  The waiter that we had among other things introduced himself three times, which I can understand maybe hes a little stressed, but I think we were the only people there that werent a) old, or b) swarming with children, so a little easier to spot.  Im pretty sure he introduced himself, we ordered drinks, then he came, introduced himself again, asked for our drinks again...and so on.  Another waitress woman we saw slinking by our table was carrying some plates to another table and proceeded to wipe her nose on her arm WHILE carrying the plates still. As for the food quality vs. quantity, all of the dishes are basically colored styrofoam in a pile with awful crunchy rice.  I ordered Orange Chicken that was in my opinion way too orange visually and taste-wise and piled high on top of some undercooked rice.  As for the edamame (soy beans), dont EVER order them, they were so overcooked the pods fell apart, for those of you who enjoy edamame, thats NOT supposed to happen! One quick last thing, the interior is a disaster, its like early Egyptian / Greco-Roman / Rennaissance / Baroque / Art Deco and a melange of other perhaps Cheesecake Factory-invented styles. Overall, awful!

Dachary C.,"Cambridge, MA",44,126,,4.0,5/24/2006,"Yummy food. Great drinks. Long waits. The Cheesecake Factory is a recent discovery for me, but one that I'm very pleased to have made. The first time I tried to go, I got turned off by the 45 minute wait to seat 1 and elected to leave. On subsequent visits, though, it was a pleasant experience. If you get there early (between 5-6) the wait isn't bad, even on a Friday night. On a weekend mealtime, though, waits are steadily long, so don't go if you're in a hurry. But if you get stuck waiting, you can always peruse the mall while you're killing time. Or use the time productively by reading the novel-length menu to start trying to decide what you want. An added pro: the bar is open seating, so start with a drink while you wait. Ahh, yes - the drinks. The Cheesecake Factory has a section of four ""Super Creamy"" signature drinks - I have now tried them all, and can safely conclude that they're all fantastic! If you've got a hankering for girly drinks, definitely try one. Warning, though: in the Flying Gorilla and the Strawberry Creamsicle, you can't even taste the alcohol - generally resulting in sucking them down far too quickly and going back for more. I find those types of drinks particularly dangerous. The menu is voluminous and very diverse. No matter what you're in the mood for, you should find something here to satisfy you. The food is very good quality and full of flavor. Do *not* expect to eat a full portion, though - either plan to split it with someone or take leftovers home. The serving sizes are easily two meals, especially if you elect an appetizer or dessert. And you will probably only be able to handle one or the other - if you're going to have an entree, be warned that appetizer + entree = no room for dessert. Likewise, entree + dessert = no room for appetizer. Eating here is definitely about picking and choosing. The tab can get expensive - especially if you add drinks and appetizer/desert. I've easily spent $80-$100 for two people. But if you're in the mood for good food and don't mind waiting to be seated and having to sift through a zillion menu choices, this is the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=280

So last night, the boy and I were hungry.  It was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten dinner yet.  A quick search showed us that The Similians would be open.  Yay!  As the boy's never tried it, I decided to bring him there.  Alas, they closed at 10 and it was now 10:30.  Then my friend called to pick up stuff from my place.  By the time we were ready to go out again to eat, it was 11:30 pm and the boy's stomach was cursing at me in Urdu, a language he doesn't even know! We were resigned to do take-out and both lukewarm on the idea.  But lo and behold, The Cheesecake Factory was open till 12:30 am!  Score #1 for TCF!  He was lukewarm on the idea and normally I'd never go there, being lukewarm on the idea of chain restaurants but I have always heard the myth of TCF, but till I moved here last year, didn't believe it actually existed.  Curiousity got the better of me.

I can sort of understand that as it was Saturday night, but still, we had reservations - you'd think they be better prepared. Once we got our table, the service was very good. We had one waitress to the whole table and she was very good at handling everyone's drink orders and dinner orders - so I had to give it 2 stars for great service. Unfortunately, the food was something that was obviously frozen and microwaved. It tasted very fake and I was not impressed (I had the quesadillas). My boyfriend had a turkey sandwich or burger, and I could see him grimacing all throughout the meal. Thinking that dessert would be the highlight of our evening, we ordered the cheesecake (we are both cheesecake lovers by the way) we heard so much about. We couldn't finish one slice - it was way too sweet and thick. We were not impressed and didn't understand why it was so highly rated. I'm sure others like it, but we weren't too happy with the quality of the food. It's definitely a fun atmosphere for large crowds and the prices are moderate - I'll give it that.

FELICIA F.,"Suffolk, MA",0,5,,3.0,3/28/2010,"My major gripe about this place is the wait for a table. There is always a long wait. After a few visits, I have decided that I don't even like their food, so now I only go for cheesecake. I thorougly enjoy bypassing the mopes waiting for a table (for nasty food and uncomforatably close seating) and go right to the counter to order my multiple slices of delicious cheesecake. This has been my thing more recently. Well the last time I visited this establishment (for cheesecake only), it was a semi disaster. First I asked the employee if they had the red velvet cheesekcake (because I did not see it in the case) and she said yes and pointed it to me. Of course I jumped all over that and asked for a piece of that and the banana creme cheesecake. My boyfriend (who worked in the food industry forever) noticed she had been handling money or something and needed fresh gloves, so he immediately reminded her of that before she began slicing up my cheesecake. He placed his order and we took a seat on the bench. This is where I'll add that for some odd reason, I do enjoy the decor of this place. Anyway we pay for cakes and go home. Upon arrival at home, I am absolutely horrified when I discover my red velvet order was somehow mistaken for apple crisp or something. How in the world did she screw that up after the animated conversation we had?! At this point, I am infuriated that I had to deal with Cambridgeside Galleria and the miscreants who frequent it, only to come home with the wrong order. I phone the place and speak to a manager who very insincerely apologizes and asks me to come back and get my cake. I respond with a no and she responds by putting me on hold forever. Finally she returns and offers to send me a $10 gift certificate. I accept.

Greg S.,"Arlington, MA",2,116,,4.0,12/30/2007,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, for many different reasons, The selection on the menu is huge, the prices may seem high but here is a simple solution, don't gorge yourself and bring home leftovers and you have 2 meals, when you factor that in it actually really isn't all that bad because their portions are huge. For instance the meatloaf which I think is really good is like half a meatloaf. Anyway, I've tried a lot of different things on the menu, most of the pasta dishes, orange chicken, some of the steak items, the brunch menu is really good, and you can always get the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito which is really good. I've also tried a lot of their cheesecake which you can get to go or buy a smaller or larger cake to go, the smaller ones are usually plenty big enough because you can cut small pieces for about ten people and they are filling. I've tried the Oreo, plain, Snickers, carrot cake, and pumpkin and they are all fantastic.

I was a bit skeptical to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in CambridgeSide  after my first (and I thought it would be the last) experience, at The Cheesecake Factory, in Rancho Mirage, California. A friend wanted to change my view on it, since she loved the place. I gave in and hoped that the food and service were better this time. I was content with the experience. We were seated right away. The waitress was very nice and brought our drinks quickly. It was, again, a hassle deciding on something given that the menu is tremendously long. After about 15-20 minutes of deliberation we all decided what we were to eat. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish contained shrimp and chicken sauteed with tomato, onions and peppers in a ""very spicy cajun sauce;"" it wasn't spicy, there was a hint of pepper in the dish, but not enough to make your tongue burn. The food was brought relatively fast given the amount of people in the restaurant. The dish was a colorful mixture of reds and oranges that expelled a delicious odor accented with spices and roasted tomatoes. I was hoping the dish didn't disappoint, like my previous experience. I dove in. The pasta in combination with the meats and the vegetables resulted in a mouthwatering experience. The flavor was there, no doubt about it. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The tomatoes were bright and complemented the meats well. Both, the shrimp and chicken went very well together, despite how weird the combination may seem. As we ate, the waitress would stop by and ask how the dishes were and was constantly refilling our drinks. My only complaint was that the dish was a bit too greasy, I understand that the sauté everything on the same pan and put everything on the plate; however, the food would have been much easier to eat if I hadn't had to carefully take the pasta from my plate up to my mouth as I was afraid the dripping grease would stain my clothes.  Overall it was a fantastic 4-star dining experience with good food, great atmosphere, and fantastic service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=180
Chelle C.,"Cambridge, MA",17,48,33,4.0,8/1/2012,"I have always been a fan of The Factory, I even used to work there (long after my love affair began).  I definitely prefer sitting at the dinner table to eat over serving... hands down! I don't know if my love for this place brings me good karma when it comes to getting good food and service but I have never had a problem here. Even though my taste in food continues to grow, this place never disappoints me.  There really is something for everyone... you just need to find the right dish- ...though, the menu can sometimes be overwhelming and it would be helpful if they had pics on the menu...  Now a days I get the Grilled Salmon with Spinach and depending on my needs either nutritional or comfort I will either get broccoli or mashed potatoes... this week, I needed some comfort, so mashed potatoes it was ... and they were actually creamier than usual (but still thick) which made it even better...!!!  So kudos to the chef too.  They also gave a good portion of spinach.  Sometimes that have skimped on that in the passed... but not Monday night!   They also agreed to give my friend the lunch portion instead of the full sized meal at the lunch price...  I forgot how much they try to please. anyway... And when I have a good server, I definitely have to Yelp about it!! Marissa... you rock!  You were polite, personable, knowledgeable and fun! And even recommended the New Oreo Cheesecake... which I got because it was National Cheesecake Day and it was half off... it was fabulous!  Thanks for the suggestion. If anyone needs suggestions of meal ideas I am happy to help you choose something that fits your desire... I am not kidding when I say I love this place. LOL... the only think I missed about working there was 50% off on meals and free meals on a double shift!  :) Anyway, go and enjoy... even if only for cheesecake and coffee, they have a good strong coffee for coffee lovers!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=180

Walked in and saw a ton of people waiting for tables but we were seated right away...Our waiter was very attentive and eager to please. Such as refilling our waters and making sure the food was good. I went with on of my friends and we both came away with more than full stomachs. Plus it was ""national cheesecake day"" and any slice of cheesecake was 1/2 off; it was a nice little perk that we weren't aware of before going in last night. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado club with a side salad. The sandwich was delicious, a little large so I had trouble fitting it in my mouth...there were large pieces of grilled chicken, plenty of avocado and bacon! The side salad was delicious but there was a little too much dressing for my liking. I still finished it all though (: My friend got a HUGE salad, that could have easily fed 4 people. According to her it was delicious and she brought the rest home for at least two more meals. After eating we did have to wait a little bit maybe 10 mins for our waiter to come back around so we could ask for the dessert menus. It was a very crowded Thursday night so it was understandable. My friend ordered the classic strawberry cheesecake and I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake....both were amazing. I couldn't finish mine even though I wanted to. The mousse was so smooth as was the cheesecake and the whipped cream was a nice contrast to the thick/rich cake.

I've personally grown to not like Cheesecake Factory.  Is it the lack of nutritional information on their website, and the oversized portions that they give out (to remedy both of these, go here:   ) .  Probably.  It's next to impossible to get something healthy unless you plan ahead. As for the food, it's not terrible, but as I mentioned before, the portions are ridiculous.  I mean, people don't need that much food.  Even something as relatively healthy and innocuous as salmon is huge.  But if you are going to go, go during the week, and expect to wait, because people eat this stuff up (literally).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=180

He immediately brought us water, some beer, and a basket of bread. Mmm I love the bread basket in the cheesecake factory. After that, he took our orders. There is the normal menu as well as a skinny menu. I had one of the lunch options from the normal menu, the lunch portions are smaller and cheaper than the regular options. I had the miso salmon, which came on a bed of brown rice. The rice was a little too packed together, the salmon was ok.

Corin B.,"Everett, United States",49,12,4,2.0,16/2/2017,"I came in last night with my boyfriend at around 8:30ish. It wasn't too busy and we were sat towards the back which I didn't mind at all. The food was good and the atmosphere is quiet, however the service wasn't great at all.  I was a waitress for years and normally try not to complain about service but it really made our time unpleasant. We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn't catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn't want us there either. Everything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn't getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine. As we were nearing the end of the meal she came over and my boyfriend asked to have his food wrapped up. I didn't even have a chance to ask for mine wrapped as she grabbed his plate and whipped around and walked off so fast. She came back with his food and again immediately walked away so quickly I couldn't ask for my food to be wrapped up. When she finally did come back I was able to get my food wrapped up and we asked for a dessert menu. My guess is she probably wasn't going to offer one because she certainly didn't want us there any longer. We ordered one piece of cheesecake to split and she brought it over with our check but insisted there was ""no rush"". After we finished up dessert she asked if we were all set with the check, which we hadn't even touched it yet as we were still eating but we put the cash in anyways. She came over and asked if it was all set again. We said yes and she asked ""do you need change?"" My boyfriend said no and that was the end. No ""thank you"", ""have a nice night"", nothing. To spend over $80 on dinner and feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed the entire time was just not worth it whatsoever. We were checked on maybe 2-3 times the entire night and never once asked/offered refills for our drinks. We would've asked ourselves but barely got to speak as she spun around and ran from our table the few times she did come over. I've been in the industry myself so I really try not to nitpick or even complain at all but it really did ruin our night out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=20

We sat in the bar area where you didn't need to be seated by the hostess who mind you wasn't in site. Then about 10 minutes waiting our waitress showed up. We eventually ordered food, how ever the chicken came out cold. Ok so upon mentioning this issue the chicken went away and we waited. I swear we waited so long that I thought I watched a snail racing across to the finish line. Manager didn't come around to apologize. We had to stop one in his tracks to inform him the problem. And did he offer anything to make up for it? Or to stop us from leaving? Nope. Instead we got a typical ""sorry""!!!!! So another. But that's not the point. We waited and waited until we were almost done with the salad. What is the point of having a chicken salad without the chicken? Sorry? That's it? Offer us a free dessert or something. So finally a hot plate of chicken came to our table by another manager. She offered ""anything else I can do for you?"" Yeah take it off our bill. Or give us a couple of sweet freebies so I can feel loved by cheesecake. So we finished our food. And waited another 30 years (as it felt) again watching the same snail moving to the other side of the finish line. Our waitress came and asked the typical question. Anything else? Yeah my check so I can escape the inescapable. And empty my tummy by walking. She finally came with the check. ****** and was anything done?******** noooo!!! So I grabbed the manager nearly pulling his shirt Out and asked to take off the chicken at least because of the fact that we ate a chicken salad without the chicken. And did he offer anything? Nope!!! Typical guy who collects a paycheck to make a living. He doesn't care nor anyone in there. They are negligent, incompetent, inconsiderate, uneducated in management and just plain dumb people. Get your act together. Educate yourself in customer satisfaction, find someone who can teach you how to approach a dissatisfied customer. And for goodness sake grow a sense of humor and don't act like a dead doorknob. Yes I had to get him to take It off and he finally did. But why should I have to call them out for their mistakes.

Unfortunately there is nothing in the Galeria which is brunch-ish, so we wandered in here. The place was empty, and we were seated pretty quickly. I got the four-cheese gluten-free pasta, and my wife the breakfast omelette. Both plates had a decent taste, but portions were smaller than I'd expected. Not unreasonably so, but normally pasta dishes are pretty sizable because well, they cost nothing to make. Afterwards, we got the only gluten-free cheesecake, which was also good. I would give three stars for this, however there were two main issues. The first was that out waiter said basically nothing, and kinda seemed upset in general? Maybe he was having a bad day, but it was pretty weird. He wasn't unfriendly, just... intensely quiet. He was good about refilling drinks though. The other big issue is that several times during brunch they were doing something that was either vacuuming or blendering or whatever, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear my wife, who was sitting 3 feet away, over the sound of it for several minutes.

I sat squirming in my chair for about 10 minutes and made eye contact multiple times with a manager at the host stand who saw me wrenching my neck in an attempt to locate our server. As I squirmed in my chair this manger , who was casually chatting with a few servers st the host stand , made eye contact with me multiple times. It was obvious we were not greeted , we had no drink order , no napkin on our table . He did not do anything to get a server to our table or even acknowledge our growing frustration . If you don't want my business that is fine. We got right up and went across to world of beer for a wonderful lunch. Cheesecake was our first choice but that will never happen again. This Cambridge location is usually empty and dead and I can see why if this is the tone this manager sets. The Braintree location has a line out the door and a long wait on every visit! If Cambridge is getting less customers they should value the few that still want to go in and pay 12 dollars for a cocktail. Greet your guest within a minute of them sitting down ! Basic rule #1! This place is awful ! Go to world of beer or a better mall / restaurant . This particular manager should probably be at Burger King with his customer service skills",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40
Tenzin Y.,"Boston, United States",48,7,20,4.0,11/4/2016,"My friend and I went on Wednesday around 2p for lunch. Surprisingly it wasn't busy then. The hostess was friendly and we only had to wait like 1 minute for seats.  Their menu has a wide selection of food. I ordered a cappuccino as it was cold that day (the cup was huge and it definitely warmed we up). We ordered crab wontons for appetizer and I was surprised it came in such a large portion size. Their breadsticks with butter was delicious (esp the brown bread). We ordered orange chicken and tomato basil pasta which were both delicious and worth the price as it came in huge portion.  Our waiter was friendly and checked in to see if everything was alright and constantly filled our glass with water. Our food came quickly and the presentation was great. Yes it's quite expensive but judging from the size it's worth it. I also suggest sharing food with your friends if you're on a tight budget. We started to get full and didn't get to order their famous cheesecake... But that's something to look forward to in the future.  Also, my friend mentioned how the lighting is pretty dim here as it was difficult to take pics of our food or to even see the food. Overall, we had a great experience here and took the leftovers home which still tasted great after a couple days. :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40
Regret B.,"Boston, United States",0,2,,1.0,17/12/2016,"The waitstaff that work the takeout are appalling.  It's not the first time that this has happened which is even worse.  When I call in my order, I have to call back a minimum of 3-5 times and ask for the manager as each time, I get put on endless hold and no-one ever picks up.  Tonight, I called in my order, said I'd be there in 30 minutes. Whoever took my call said the food will be ready and out in 15 minutes.  It took me 40 minutes to get there.   As I was trying to park my car for curbside pickup there was a large SUV which parked over 2 spaces, I called into the restaurant to see if they could run the order out to my car and I would just pay them. However the employee (woman) who answered said, ""Oh, I'm sure that's my ride, I'm on my way out and I'll tell him to move.""  I said ok and waited, 10 minutes later, a woman waddles out and continues to shove bags of food into the back of the car and then squeezed herself into the front seat. Another 5 minutes passes before she and the driver pull out. I park and walk into the takeout area.  There are 2 employees standing behind the takeout counter, one of them fussing with her cell phone and the other plays with rolls of coins in the cash register.  They see me but ignore me and continue NOT to do their job. I walk away to the hostess desk and tell the hostess  that no one acknowledged that I was standing at the takeout area.  The hostess tells me she's going to get the manager and walks me back to the takeout area where the ""coin girl"" decides to acknowledge me, at which point the manager comes up and I repeat the story in front of the ""coin and cell phone girls"" as they stand there and shrug their shoulders.  It was probably 50 minutes now since my initial phone call and my food is no where to be seen.  The manager rushes back to the kitchen and again, I'm left to wait.  After what seems like too many minutes, I leave. I call back 10 minutes later to ask for the regional manager's name and phone number.  The hostess who answers the phone puts me on hold to find the information.  5 minutes later, she answers the phone again, telling me the restaurant manager is busy and can't get that information to me.  I said, "" You're telling me the manager who I just spoke with face to face, is too busy to take my call?  Is that right?""  She responds, ""Well, I....I ....can't really find him, I don't know where he is, I think he's with another guest.""  At which point, I say good bye and hang up. So, if the hostess doesn't know where the manager is, how does she know he's with another guest or busy?.   It seems that no  one in the restaurant knows which way is up.   The service is subpar even for a low-level mass  production franchise restaurant. the employees are juvenile, rude and extremely unprofessional",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40
Josh C.,"Cambridge, United States",49,27,11,3.0,10/9/2016,"Your classic favs at the Cheesecake Factory. You can't go wrong with the food here as there are possible selections from every type of cuisine: Asian, American, Italian, etc. We got the chicken and shrimp gumbo and it was fairly tasty. Have that with white rice and you've got yourself a full meal. Appetizer was a white crab with asparagus dip. No complaints there: good old seafood dip with toasted bread. There is an issue when your server fails to notice that during your hour of dining experience that you didn't had a single utensil at your table and had to keep stealing from the adjacent table. There is an issue when the servers congregate in front of your table and you notice that your server, and EVERY one of them at this place, is chatting and taking 15 minutes to enter each order. Verdict: Came here for the food because we didn't want to eat at the food court. Knew the service would be slow given the countless previous reviews.

Service was a little slow, it was 12.00 lunchtime on  Wednesday and fairly quiet, but I had a wait before my order was taken, and the waiter had to come tell me my food wouldn't be long. I had the Renee's special (cup of soup, half turkey sandwich & small green salad). The soup was cream of wild mushroom, containing shitake mushrooms, it was not to my taste:  rich, strong and intense in flavour, almost like a steak sauce and quite salty. The sandwich was ok, but the salad was limp, with some of the leaves showing signs of decay as they were dissolving, the tomatoes were hard and tasteless. $3 for bottomless fountain drinks seemed a good deal and the waiter kept me topped up.  After the initial delay the waiter returned to my table twice to see if everything was ok, but I felt to awkward to say I didn't enjoy the soup. I decided against cheesecake for dessert even though that's what I went in for in the first place. $20 for soup, half a sandwich, drink & tip.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40
Jessika E.,"Boston, United States",0,8,12,2.0,29/7/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory countless times. However, I haven't been on a late Friday night. It didn't seem busy from the walk in (before 8pm). There was no one waiting. This was the first time we got seated right away. First, we were a party of two and our hostess wanted to seat us at a table near the front with several other parties. It looked crowded over there. It didn't have any arm room, so we asked to be in a booth. They accommodated us. We get seated. Now, it still doesn't look crowded just a good amount of parties. There was a party of four behind us that was clearly enjoying their selves because we could hear the commotion over our convo. Now our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders. Immediately, she wanted to take our orders from the menu. Mind you, we haven't been in the booth for five minutes yet. She arrives with our drinks in less than two minutes and brings forth our bread. Now, we still haven't looked decided what we wanted because it's only been a minute or two. She asked us if we're ready to order. Now I'm feeling rushed. We don't say anything. We just say we need some time! Anywho, she comes back now and we order our appetizers. Now a party of eight I wanna comes in. They are given full cooperation. They were sitting right across from us. Not only were they not rushed but they we're attended too. minutes before we got the appetizer we were asked about entrees. Now the table was small so I normally don't order my appetizer and entrees so close together. However, we were feeling rushed so we just put them in. We did not see the waitress again. We had to flag her down countless times. She passed by us multiple times not even to look and see if we're we're still living or if our food was to our satisfaction. Not once were we checked on after taking our orders. The only time we seen her again was the last time we flagged her time for the check and we ordered our dessert to go because we knew we weren't seeing her again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40

Anymore than that, go somewhere else. Their staff is not trained to handle a half full or completely full restaurant - you won't talk to your waiter for awhile (although you will see them just hanging out talking to other waiters), once you place your order, you should probably bring a snack because you're in for an even longer wait.

S P.,"Saugus, United States",0,4,,1.0,30/3/2017,"ATROCIOUS!!! Never have I ever had the worst dining experience in my entire life up until last night. Our waiter (JOHN) was the utmost disgusting, rudest, and pompous individual I have ever met. He never properly introduced himself when greeting us and never asked us what we wanted for beverages. Instead he assume we wanted water and bread without a peep out of his mouth. I kindly asked for lemon and before I was able to order a cocktail he cut me off and said ""sure, I'll get you lemon"" then quickly left. By that awkward moment my friend and I decided to just settle for water since clearly he couldn't let us order drinks.  When he came back with my lemon he asked us if we were ready to order. I was extremely frustrated, but bit my tongue and ordered. My friend requested if she could have the chicken Bellagio, but instead with the Louisiana chicken and his response ""So you want fried chicken..."" with an unwelcoming tone. This was uncalled for and instead of stating the obvious he could've addressed it politely and with no attitude that way we could of had a better understanding.  Instead of leaving or requesting a new server we decided to deal with his sour personality. We proceeded to order and got 2 appetizers and 1 entree . In the past the server normally asks us if we would like the order to come out together. This man was so quick to cut us off again that we never got a chance to even ask.  He came back to drop off appetizer plates and basically slammed it on our table. He came back to drop off the 2 appetizers and not once asked us how everything was. Then before the entree even arrived he didn't bother to pick up the unused dirty plates. Eventually I just stacked the plates together thinking he could take a hint. Correct me if I am wrong, but EVERY TIME I get pasta they offer parmesan, but no he didn't. We didn't even bother to ask and didn't want to hunt down our waiter who clearly doesn't want to be there.  We barely even spoke to him throughout the entire evening. Again, he never asked us how our entree was either. He came back to the table again to give us water when we didn't need it because our cups were practically full. My friend kindly said ""Sir, would you please remove these plates."" HE CUT HER OFF of course and said ""YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!"" I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn't know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn't even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us.  At this point we couldn't take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend ""Are you still working on that?"" mind you she didn't have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said ""Well what am I working on there's nothing on my plate."" He didn't deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec.  Finally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn't even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn't even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he's a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel. This is the last time I will be dining at The Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge because he really ruined it for us and that's very unfortunate because I use to love coming here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=40

Rather Be D.,"Cambridge, United States",0,7,,1.0,25/1/2017,"Hi - This was my dining experience.  I was dining alone. I was seated across from the waiter transaction station. The waiter brought me bread with butter. I immediately informed him that I don't eat dairy products and that if they put it in my food I would send it back. I asked him to bring me olive oil. He said ""right away"".  I waited for several minutes and watched him wait on other tables and my bread grow cold. I looked at him as he walked by and he asked me about the weather and if it was still nice out. I reminded him about the olive oil. He had forgotten. Not long thereafter I was served the grilled salmon that I had ordered. It was quite raw in the center. I showed it to the waiter who said that they served their salmon medium rare. I repeated a few times as he kept saying that that it was served medium rare that it was raw. He took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and said it was a mistake and that they would not knowingly serve their food that way. The waiter came by and said they would give me a fresh serving. I waited for a while. Out came salmon drenched in butter, not grilled, and with pesto sauce on it. I had ordered just plain grilled salmon as it is offered on the menu, with nothing on it, and grilled.  The manager returned and denied there was butter on it, said that it was grilled, just some oil from the pesto sauce (which pesto sauce, or butter, was not on my original order.  Given that he was aggressively denying there was anything awry with the order, I said that I didn't want to argue, and just pushed the food away and put my head in my hands, as I was 99% sure that it was butter not oil. Another manager came over and asked if everything was all right. Clearly it wasn't.  I said that I was willing to pay for the meal but I did not trust it and would not eat it. I got my money back.  It is a violation of US health codes to serve uncooked fish and if the kitchen makes a mistake the second time it should not be denied.  I was taking myself out for my birthday.

I like the standardized dishes that I can have the same quality of food regardless of where I go. There are several dishes that I really like - chicken salad, meatloaf, carbonara pasta, and American burger. Big portion is a plus too. But the highlight is the cheesecake after the main meal.

Our server Eduardo came right away and served us drinks & bread. We ordered an app and two entrees plus a side of mashed potatoes. Everything arrived in good time except for the mashed potatoes. I was told it would be right out, then 5 min later was told they ran out and would take 20 minutes to make. I didn't mind because I was super desperate and craving mashed potatoes. I could wait.. i would have waited all night if I had to. 10 min later the manager came over and said it would take another 15 min. He apologized, made the mashed potatoes complimentary, and even made one of our entrees complimentary (I did not expect that at all!). We ordered the godiva cheesecake while we waited, then eduardo brought out hot and fresh mashed potatoes in a takeout container.. Not one, but TWO heaping portions! It was the highlight of my day.

We came around 2pm on a holiday (Independence Day), so it was relatively busy. Luckily, we were seated quickly at a cozy little booth for two. I got the coulotte steak (common name ""sirloin"", my childhood favorite!) and it was served on its own plate, while my mash practically came on its own palanquin. At first I wondered why my steak had its own giant plate, and then I saw ALL THE WONDERFUL STEAK JUICES.  The steak alone was very lean and tender, BUT THOSE JUICES!! Oh gosh, it was just the cherry on top of my entrée.  For dessert, the sir and I shared a toasted marshmallow smores cheesecake. I'm a lover of smores in its pure form, so I don't feel like the particular flavor belongs on cheesecake. Still, for a cheesy variation, it was very rich and toasty. The glazing marshmallow was beautifully browned and the cheesecake itself is incredibly rich. Cheesecake Factory quality, definitely.

The restaurant was mostly empty.  We walked in the door and the manager greated us tersely - almost like he was ready for a fight. We let him know my wife and I would be meeting our son and asked if we could be seated at a booth if it was available. He let us know it wasn't and had the hostess seat us at a two-person table. A little weird, but we asked to be reseated and, after checking, the hostess seated us at a 4-person. Our waitress was great.  Quickly taking our order and updating it when our son arrived.  Food came out fine and was delicious. But then we ordered dessert. Initially the hostess came and let us know that would be a little longer than normal (10 minutes) because they had to cook new shortbread.  After the 10 minutes went by she came and apologized again and told us it probably be more like 20. After another 20 minutes went by she came and apologized again saying sorry is taking so long.  Finally the manager comes out and says that they burnt the shortbread.

Ben S.,"Allston, United States",217,118,11,2.0,23/11/2015,"I've been here three times and all three times received poor service in some shape or form. Some of the waiters are super friendly and very professional and the food quality is on par with all other CF locations.  However, in my most recent visit there were four people joking around loudly at the hostess stand that were swearing and completely ignoring me for about a minute. Then when I asked for a table for two the host made a joke saying ""nope sorry you're gonna have to sit on the floor"".  Then when we were seated I waited for five minutes without a waiter greeting our table until I asked for help from a random waiter.  During our meal we were right next to a POS station and could hear pretty loudly waiters talking about how customers were being ""cheap"" with tips lately- suggesting the foreign customers were ignoring the sticker in the check books saying that ""it is customary to tip 15-20% in America"".  Then when our check did come the waiter had printed the wrong check - probably a rushed mistake but still just one more part of our experience that was negative.  I want to emphasize that some people that work here are extremely professional and that the food is great. I've just had several poor customer service experiences that have made me want to avoid this location even though it is convenient for me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=60

They didn't bring out my three year old's pasta & butter (pasta and butter!!!) until more than 15 minutes after the rest of us were served. My son's kids' meal consisted of four tiny chicken strips, not nearly enough for any normal kid to be satisfied. The manager made me feel like I was inventing the problem but if so, why was he stopping by every table in our row? It sucked for everyone. Then the waitress brought me a bill and told me the manager had comped my son's chicken strips, but what was comped was the replacement dish they brought out, even though I hadn't requested one--how generous (eyeroll). I made myself clear to the waitress and manager and ended up having both the strips and the pasta removed from the check.

This time we only went for the cheesecake pick up (after calling in) - easy enough...you would think.  SO disappointed. Anybody who knows me knows I rarely give one star and (TRY) to be patient, but service was too bad this time. I called at exactly 5:30pm for a 6inch strawberry cheesecake and mentioned I will be there in 20 minutes. I ALSO double checked and made sure the cake can be ready for me to just grab and go - OK GREAT. (I know it's Saturday night and it gets super busy and I don't know what it takes to make a cheesecake. Mostly because I don't eat them and this was for a bday.)  We get there just past 6pm (so more than the 20 minute warning) and they say it's not ready and is being decorated, which will take 5-10 minutes. Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (""it's not ready yet"")...and wait. We then proceeded  to watch one of the ""bakers"" take a finished frozen cake out of the fridge to put on strawberries and frosting.... Please note that during this time, I was able to re-download Yelp (new phone! Yay), check in, and write this review. Yes, disappointed.  As Mama would say: If you can't estimate the timing, don't estimate. When you set the expectation, meet it. Please and thank you.

We ordered the crab and artichoke dip which took 20 mins to come- it was good but the bread it came with was hard as a rock. Is cheesecake factory going to pay for my dentist appointment if my teeth somehow breaks trying to chew on this? The boy got an alcoholic drink which he enjoyed and I got a strawberry fruit smoothie which I will advise you to stay away because it's seeds city in there.  The worst part of this was that the boy ordered one of the ""specials"" which happen to be pineapple chicken and shrimp (rice dish). No where did it say it contained cilantro and when it came.......40 mins later it was the biggest part of the meal. HE DESPISES cilantro but did not want to wait for them to remake since it already took so long in the first place so he didn't say anything and attempted to eat it. Oh- to top if off they did not include ANY shrimp but they decided to add in an extra ingredient which he also hates- MUSHROOMS. Wow, just wow. I'm impressed that the chef decided to just alter the dish to his own liking instead of ours. The food runner even said this is the pineapple chicken and shrimp dish.

My 3 colleagues received their food and must have waited 5-10 minutes for them to bring me mine. I'm under the impression they forgot my order and thought the app was mine even though I didn't order the app. Anyways, chicken tacos were cold, not much flavor, weak tortilla to hold all the soggy ingredients.

Called in my order.  Asked what sides come with what I was ordering (which was a combo of grilled salmon and shrimp scampi), I was told by the girl on the phone, ""mashed potatoes... and whatever comes with the salmon and whatever comes with the scampi"". Ha! I could have guessed two thirds of that response. I call the number from the curbside parking (as instructed on their website), no answer. Okay. I go in, pick it up and pay, including a 10% tip (it's take out), and I ask for utensils.  Get to my room (two minutes away), EVERY THING is swimming in some kind of cream sauce. Wrong order. There is shrimp and there is salmon, but clearly not what I ordered (check out the pic after I choked it down). And cold to boot. And I got two plastic forks. That's it.  Don't patronize this place.  I'm not hard to please, but this was a joke, if not a slap in the face. I guess $35.00 for take out dinner for one, doesn't warrant a little attention to detail.  Horrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. UPDATE: Just spoke to the manager. He told me they get a lot of complaints about the combos and I should write a letter to corporate.

Erika R.,"Chantilly, United States",196,9,4,2.0,30/4/2017,"I'm in the middle of dining at the restaurant right now and it's not looking very good from how everything is presenting itself. I was surprised to see no host at the front for minutes and was amazed to find that there wasn't a wait time when I came in with my family to the restaurant and we were seated fairly quickly.  As we sat down the waitress told us the specials and took down our drinks, appetizers, and a request that we have only the honey wheat bread before she left.  The drinks were simple: iced tea, coke, water with lemon, strawberry lemonade, and buffalo wings. When the waitress returned several minutes later, she forgot we ordered all honey wheat; as well as my mother's lemon for her water. Then it turned out that they ran out of iced tea? So my father opted to order a strawberry lemonade as well after placing our main entrees and my brother realized his coke was flat. Right now, my father is still waiting on his soup; I re-ordered the lemon for my mother that has yet to arrive; and a table next to ours had gotten all honey wheat bread as well as their meal when we had gotten in 15 minutes before them (maybe that's me also being a bit bitter). Sitting in the dining area, I'm trying to remain optimistic that maybe there are hiccups within the kitchen and the rest of the dining staff, but it doesn't make much sense to me seeing as though there are also several open tables and that more than 30 minutes have already elapsed where I'm not presented with a meal and that there are still appetizer plates and an empty bread bowl that hadn't been taken away. Maybe about ~5-7 minutes after I finished writing my last statement the food came out and the waitress had a surprised look on her face when my father asked about his soup and she ran back to get it saying it was on its way. When she came back, we asked for a third time about the lemon, but said it was for the entree of a pan seared salmon and the Asian taco lettuce wraps. I ordered farfalle where bacon bits were burnt and it seemed as though the tomatoes were raw and simply cut and thrown into the dish. Then my brother's jambalaya pasta was drenched with a watery sauce. After ordering dessert, service improved, but by that point, I've already made my opinion on this location of the establishment.

My waiter was very attentive and professional but that was the only decent this tonight. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my first bite there was a bread bag wire in my sandwich that cut my lip. I informed the manager and she asked me if I wanted to keep the sandwich. I declined and she asked me if I wanted to replace it with something else. She left the menu for me to look at and said she would be back to check on me in a few minutes. I waited and she never came. My waiter did return shortly after and took care of my order. We waited an additional 45 minutes for my food so I just asked them to pack it up. ( understandable it is 2 days before Christmas but I was opening they would expedite it for me since I cut my lip due to a wire .. )  So we are in the restaurant for about 2.5 hours now and finally ready to go. I didn't bother eating my meal since my friend was already finished with hers. Our waiter came with our check and guess what? The sandwich was still on my bill including my new order! I asked for a manager and another gentleman came out. He said he would fix this for me right away. I asked him for some sort of discount since I didn't even get to eat my meal and we waited for so long. At first he seemed like he did not want to offer anything but suggested I take a cheese cake home. When I refuse he gave me a look and took my check and said ""I'll see what I can do.""  He ended up removing the sandwich which I returned and removing an appetizer we had ordered previously. He removed the cheapest item instead of removing my replacement meal which I could not even eat. I know it was a busy night but both managers on staff were less then pleasing to deal with.

Ok no problem the new girl made a mistake. But then I kindly asked if they knew about this mistake why didn't they contact me seeing as I left them my number. The girl then gave me an attitude telling me she just heard about it. Like seriously? . After waiting over 20 minutes my family and I were finally seated.

We each got a meal since we knew dessert wasn't in the picture. Their portions are enormous which is so unnecessary. They must waste tons of food daily. I ordered the vegetable salad which ended up being teeny tiny pieces of vegetables in the lettuce. I couldn't tell if the asparagus was scallions or actually asparagus. It didn't make sense to me to have a salad w/ such tiny pieces of vegetables that they were barely noticeable. My friend got an omelette which on the other hand was basically like an egg pocket. Instead of her items being incorporated into the eggs it was placed in the middle of the omelette like a hot pocket or something. So we ended up being confused at why her food items (not cut up) were wrapped in egg & mine were all chopped up.

I ended the meal with a yummy chocolate cake and my son had the strawberry shortcake.   Our waitress was very good.  She was upbeat, and attentive without being annoying.  The restaurant is noisy, but we were seated in a booth near the kitchen and it felt like we were sort of in an insulated area.

He visited the table next to us, 3 times before finally we flagged him down to take our order. We waited an extremely long time to get our food and when it was served it was barely warm like it waited a long time in the window before being served.  We never did get a refill on our sodas, we asked for our meals to be boxed up. He brought out two boxes and a bag to us, we boxed up our own leftovers.  He then picked up the leftovers at the table behind us and boxed those up in the kitchen for them, and presented them to the couple.  The place was empty, he wasn't busy, the server had three tables with two people at each table.

Kelvin N.,"Bethesda, United States",33,9,,1.0,1/5/2015,"LARGE GROUPS SHOULD AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS. When a restaurant deserves only one star despite serving above-average food, either the service, location, or prices are exceptionally unreasonable. Here, it's the service. THREE confirmations of a single reservation for 30 people were insufficient to convince the manager that the customer really values the reservation, and highly respects the restaurant, knowing how popular and busy it can be. Over the phone, the manager promised 2 tables of 15, only to split us into 4 tables of unequal size all over the restaurant. Actions speak louder than words; how the inability to honor such a concept earned the manager his position is utterly revealing of the restaurant's leadership. Arrogance and complacency do overshadow respect for the customer - this restaurant is an epitome of that.

Victoria G.,"Seattle, United States",1,37,8,2.0,27/9/2015,"First, the good... The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is really good, and a huge portion. I'd say it can easily feed 3-4 people. Throw in bread, apps, drinks and dessert and you'll leave stuffed. Their drinks are decent, and their apps are nice to try. Their cheesecake list is very large, and has something for everybody although I find them wayyyy too sweet. Now, for the bad... I used to love their Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and would get it every time I went. Last time I got it, it looked nothing like it did every other time. There were only 4 small pieces of tuna, a much smaller bed of lettuce (and wilted), one slice of tomato and 2 incredibly thin slices of avocado, a big heaping of ginger and then the side of dressing. I noticed they had raised the price by a few dollars as well. I was very disappointed but the waitress insisted this was how it was. Although I told her I've had the dish many times she seemed lost for words and did nothing. I expressed my disappointment later to management and they offered to mail me a voucher in the amount of the dish as they agreed that's not how it was supposed to come out. I never got the voucher. Last time I was here, my bf and I wanted to try two new appetizers, one of which was the chicken pot stickers. He has several food allergies, and asked what was in the chicken pot stickers. The waitress looked at us incredulously and said ""ummm...chicken?"" like we were a bunch of idiots. She looked right at me when I told her we needed to know if there was anything else in there because he has food allergies. She just stood there and stared, so my bf further clarified that sometimes there are other things in pot stickers, like carrots and cabbage, both of which he is allergic to. She finally said ""oh! you should have told me you had allergies! so do you want the pot stickers or do you want me to ask the chef what's in them?"" We obviously wanted to know what's in them, why else would we ask???

We waited another 15 minutes and no one played attention to us because they new we were pissed. Not even a crayon was given to us to distract a child from the fact that he was hungry and now tired. I understand a lot if things being in the industry especially screwing things up from time to time but as a server you should know that kids eat first and as a manager you deliver the kids food yourself and either take the thing off the bill since you know it's been an hour for a kids pizza to come out and since you know your service is bad. I made an amazing chocolate cake just for customers who had a bad experience for some reason and we want to show that we know we screwed up and we are sorry. That's for making us wait an hour with a crying kid making all the other tables think we are a bad table....,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=140

However, it has been awhile so I thought I would give them another chance. Sorry I did! I won't make that mistake again. The restaurant was freezing cold to start with.  But, lucky I had a jacket with me. As it is late September in Mass. The staff was nice, hostesses and my server Paco.  Though other than my server Paco, no one said anything about my horrible experience. Never saw a manager. I ordered the Ahi Tartar , it was really good. less than 400 calories as well. Then I Ordered a mushroom burger,with sweet potato fries. ( you pay extra for sweet potato fries.) Paco asked me how I wanted the burger cooked, I always get it well done, because, as we all know E coli lurks in ground beef. Especially at a chain that probably gets its' meat from CON AGRA.    When it came out, my 10 fries were over cooked and very dry, but that was not my complaint. My issue was the burger.  First it was laden with mayo. After I scrapped all thought off, I cut the burger in half only to see the meat was raw inside. Not even rare!  It really scared me.    Thank You Jesus that I had not bitten into it. I showed Paco my burger, He offered 2xs to send it back. I declined because, you never send food back to the Kitchen. Not if you want to eat it. Any way, I just thought I would take it with me and cook it later .    Paco did give me a dessert of my choice for my inconvenience. I got a blueberry cheesecake.  It too was horrible. They are not like real cheesecake , it is all processed ingredients you can taste it.  Whipped cream is also processed. I would think for nearly $8.00 a slice, it should be real.   By the way I did ask if they had gluten free rolls for the Burger, they did not . No gluten free products at all. The place is busy and I don't get it. It is just not good.  Prices are high as well. I never mind spending $$ if it is good.   Sorry , but Cheesecake factory is not.

I would at least have expected for them to be mediocre at best. But, it wishes that it could even be a mediocre-level. Dry and flavorless cod fish tacos for $15. I was overwhelmed by the presentation of my plate. It looked full and delicious. One bite, and I was immediately regretful. The taco shells were half warm/half cold. Cabbage was used as the lettuce, but they used the hard white part of it. It felt like eating cold cow hide. The beans were gritty and hard and the rice boasts of zero flavor. Bad choice on the menu. I should have just stuck with a burger. Our server Christopher was a really cool guy. He took our requests (extra bread, lemons, sour cream) seriously and delivered promptly. I ordered the crab cake bites, and he accidentally ordered the full priced ones. With a sight hesitation of wanting to speak up, I decided to call it to his attention, anyway.

Apologizes and says they can remake a new order.  Uh, no thanks. Asked to pay for my soda and leave.  Manager said don't worry about the soda and apologized.

The wait for food was long, and the manager came by to apologize, not that we had complained. I ordered the Rene special, a chicken salad sandwich with salad and a tortilla soup. The soup was great, the salad was huge but unappealing as it was mostly mixed greens drowning in dressing with a few tomatoes. The chicken salad sandwich was not really like chicken salad, it was large chunks of chicken in a mayo sauce with lettuce and tomato. It tasted better later when I ate the second half open faced (I fed the bread to some geese) because I could taste the almonds much better. I got the salted caramel cheesecake and it was fantastic!

We ordered drinks and got them in about 15 minutes. Our food arrived at 9:48! They forgot to bring our appetizers which end it up working well because the servings were large and we were so full. We ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wrap. This was our favorite dish. The chicken was seasoned with a lot of flavor. Our second favorite was the eggplant Parmesan with pasta. Some of the pasta had pesto. The eggplant was delicious but the pasta needed more flavor. I ordered the combo salmon and shrimp scampi. The shrimp was tasty but the dish was just ok.

I used to work in this mall for a good 4+ years, and my co-workers and I would go down every Friday night after closing and have drinks and food. The best thing I can say is that though inconsistent, it is pretty solid. I mean, if we really didn't like it, would we continue to go there week after week? If you've ever been to a CF before, you know the deal -- HUGE portions, fast service, friendly waitstaff.  One thing that I feel is often overlooked is their mixed drink menu. Awesome selection! Some really great and unique cocktails (especially if you're a girly-girl like me and like sweeter, fruit-infused drinks), all of which are delicious.  The cheesecake is, for the most part, to die for. Some of the flavors don't really fancy me, and I've come across a few that fall into the ""too"" category -- too sweet, too cheesy, too fruity, too chocolatey, etc. But, I've found a few that I consistently love -- the pumpkin pie cheesecake (this is seasonal), the banana cream cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and red velvet cheesecake. You can never go wrong with any of those. Some other dishes that I like and have been consistently good -- the sliders, chicken taquitos, chicken madeira, steak diane, hibachi steak, and one of my all-time favorites, pasta da vinci.

Dan C.,"Cambridge, United States",602,303,23,3.0,17/1/2013,"Confession time, I've been here twice in the last two weeks.  Once with my Dad as it is his favorite restaurant, and once with friends because up until a week ago many of us hadn't been here in years. This is one of those places that people probably aren't using yelp for unless they've been frozen in carbonite for the last 20 years because these days kids come out of the womb knowing what the Cheesecake Factory is.  Why this place is packed all the time is beyond me...well it probably has something to do with the massive portions, infinitely long menu, and saccharine drinks. Would I bring a date here? Hell no--it has about as much personality as a boiled ham.  Would I go here if a bunch of people all wanted to get dinner but were each insistent on pizza, pasta, Chinese, classic American, Southern, etc and all want it to taste exactly the same? Yes, I would.  The menu is like a compendium of food that has existed around the world and throughout time.  Its 21 pages of random things that people may or may not have thrown together after getting stoned. Food: 21 pages of chicken.  Goddamn people must eat a lot of chicken.  When I went here with my Dad he got a cajun pasta and I got what they told me was ""their take"" on chicken parm.  How someone has a take on chicken parm is beyond me, if you make chicken parm, its chicken parm, end of story.  Anyways, both of your dishes tasted exactly the same, but you should expect that from a place which is loved by soccer moms the world over.  When I went with friends I had a burger (doesn't matter which one since they all taste the same) and an order of the guacamole...which the waiter said we could get extra spicy, so we did.  The guac was quite possibly the least spicy thing ever conceived by man.  The burger was huge and cooked to order so I can't complain about that, though it's probably more food than should be in a person at a time.  I had the pineapple upside-down cheesecake, which turned out to be one of the worse decisions I've made as of late (and trust me, I've made some bad decisions lately).  Their super dense cheesecake sandwiched between two cold blocks of cake with the density of diamonds.  Oh, if you're curious, look up the calories for the dishes...you won't be that surprised. Drinks: I asked the waitress if I could get a Gimlet and she gave me a look like I told her the ending to Titanic.  So I decided to stick to the menu.  The Firefly, long island, and the mojitos are incredibly sweet, so if you actually like the taste of your liquor, then hold off. Service: Amazing service.  Way to go 20 year old girl and guy with awesome hair who's been there for 7 years, you're what made this place awesome for me.  The waiters can take you front to back then front again through the menu while blindfolded and lit on fire. Bottom Line: You really don't want to go here because there are so many great little places in this city we call Boston, but if you're at the mall and your options are this place or PF Changs, good God, go here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=200

At this point my boyfriend still hadn't eaten his food, which was also cold. The manager DENISE approached our table and was incredibly rude telling me that I was wrong that it was syrup. Again didn't offer me anything else. I asked for the check, which was brought back with my boyfriend's meal still on it (which was not eaten). I politely explained that we shouldn't be charged as he was not intending on eating. The manager Denise started yelling and then stormed off without letting us get a word in edgewise. My boyfriend simply under his breath said ""what the fuck"" and the manager happened to hear in passing. She told us to get out, and don't come back, proceeding to call MALL SECURITY on us.

Michelle J.,"Boston, United States",92,51,1,2.0,19/2/2012,"For some reason, the Cheesecake Factory chain has built up a good amount of hype for itself--particularly amongst out-of-towner suburbanites.  If it weren't for my family's love of this place, I'd probably never have stepped foot in here a second time.   TCF tries to be all things for all people, and herein lies its main failure.  It is a jack of all foods, master of none.   In no way is it necessary for a menu to be 15+ pages long.   While I appreciate my ability to order a Thai lettuce wrap, a fried macaroni and cheese ball ""Glamburger"" (WTF is a GLAMBURGER? WTF are fried mac n' cheese balls?), Baja chicken tacos, BBQ salmon, etc. all from the same place, I am overwhelmed and even turned off by the sheer number of choices.  After all, if the cooks need to maintain that huge of a repertoire, how are they possibly going to do them well?  There is a very good reason why the best of the best restaurants only offer a few items on the menu.  I'm not saying TCF has to be best of the best, but some restraint would be welcome.  Even more of a turn-off than the long menu are the full page advertisements on every other page of said menu.  Cheesecake F. presents itself as a classy date gig--but it really isn't that classy to pick out your Chicken Madeira while simultaneously discovering the best place to get hair electrolysis.  Stay classy, TCF.  You really know how to set the dining mood.  When you first arrive at TCF, you gather like hungry anxious cattle in the waiting area, hoping your table will be called sometime in the next century.  A 25 minute wait is not even the norm for a Friday/Saturday night--most of the time you are looking at waits upwards of 40-45 minutes.   But TCF will not take reservations, either, so really the only time it makes sense to come here is when nobody in your party is actually hungry.  Gee, that makes a whole lot of sense.   I don't have much to say about the food itself except for every meal I've ever ordered here requires a heavy dose of salt and pepper before it actually starts to taste like food.   You would think the cheesecake factory's one redeeming quality would be its cheesecake.  But alas, even the cheesecake kind of sucks at the Cheesecake Factory.  Again, too many options and they all basically end up tasting the same.  You can almost  taste the conveyor-belt uninspired uniformity of every slice.  I dare say that the frozen cheesecakes in the grocery store satisfy my cheesecake cravings more.   One star for the whole wheat bread, which is the only thing I've ever actually enjoyed here, and one star for the dish presentation which showed some attention to detail.  That's as generous as i can be.   One last thought--when I go to restaurants like TCF, which are notorious for having 1200 calorie + entrees, I typically look for something that might count as ""lighter fare.""  TCF has this really embarrassing way of highlighting all the low-cal options on its ""Skinnylicious"" menu. OK, just because I'm trying to eat healthier doesn't mean I like to shout over the din that I'd like to order the ""Skinnylicious grilled salmon.""  Between the ""Glamburgers"" and the ""Skinnylicious salads,"" i'm starting to think that Paris Hilton inspired this menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220

The place has an endless selection of delicious cheesecakes.  They do have food though, and lots of it.  Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu with everything from Salads and sandwiches, to seafood and Chinese food, to Mexican and traditional American fare.  The entrees are also GIGANTIC. I can throw down a lot of food in one meal and I still can never finish an entire entrée from this place. Despite the wide selection on the menu, cheesecake delivers a solid dining experience. My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala followed up with the Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.  It might be 1500+ calories but its worth each one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220
Ajit S.,"Cambridge, United States",0,4,,1.0,13/6/2012,One of the pasta dishes ordered was microwaved. The plate itself was piping hot and pasta was cold and rock solid.  Even other stuff was nothing spectacular. Typical commercial chain food albeit with decent ambiance and hefty price tags. One should not be surprised given the menu is as thick as a macro-economics textbook and restaurant has huge seating area. The chefs cannot be anyone else but a bunch of microwave experts. The wait was also very long.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220

It was 3 of us and we ordered 2 appetizers, the waitress brought out 1 and we also ordered a extra drink, that she didn't bring out, instead she brought out our food so we ate and ordered our dessert to go. When I signed the check and included my tip to come off my debit card, she brought it back because I didn't leave the ""suggested gratuity"" her words where ""was the service ok? Because I gave you a paper with the amounts and you pick from those 3 because that's how I get paid"" I'm sorry but that is very unacceptable because I've been a waitress before and anything is better than nothing and it wasn't like I left her a 2-3 dollar tip.

Mary G.,"Cambridge, United States",346,101,4,2.0,3/11/2010,"I will be up front, did I expect to like the Cheesecake factory?  Not really.  However, a friend of mine was visiting from out of town and aside from being gluten intolerant she is also the pickiest eater I have ever known: I asked her if she had ever consumed a whole, cooked bean the answer was ""Not since I was old enough to say 'no'.""  My friend was hoping to eat something that wasn't just white rice and diet coke, though, and who am I to deny her that? So yeah, I was left to choose from places like TGIFridays, Ruby Tuesday's, etc.  Kind of a Hobson's Choice if there ever was one.  I went with Cheesecake Factory, kind of grimly curious to see the substance behind stories of 1500 calorie salads and deep fried macaroni.  The environment was more cavernous than I expected, and about as bright as as one too.  At one point during dinner the lights inexplicably became quite bright, then faded back to dimness.  The decor was kind of odd to say the least, we couldn't decide if it was faux-Egyptian, Mayan, Roman, or other. One friend and I split the fish tacos and the Clubhouse salad.  The picky friend got the chicken medallions.  The white fish on the tacos were surprisingly good, but the tempura batter had a taste of rancid fry-oil aftertaste.  The tacos became tastier when we added some ranch dressing to them.  They also came with a somewhat bland side of dirty rice and beans, in a cast iron dish.  At 14 dollars for 4 tacos, however, I was not impressed. The Clubhouse Salad was not the disgustilicious dish I was hoping for but was rather a decent salad with a rather odd addition of cubed cheddar in addition to the cheddar shreds.  Regardless, the salad was kind of decent, in no way seemed healthy, but left us full (it was apparently only about 1100 calories).  The picky friend's dish was, after her requested alterations, a large pile of white rice and 3 or 4 pieces of plain grilled chicken, plus an order of diet coke, of course.  She seemed satisfied. The service was perfectly fine, diet coke refilled, and it was explained the gluten-free menu was currently unavailable this week but would be back soon. I, however, will gladly not return for mediocrity at best, not when The Helmand is right around the corner... or a mall food court.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220

The food is sometimes awesome (The Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp is my fave!) and sometimes just ok.  Not sure what type of fish they use in their fish tacos, but I wouldn't recommend them. Occasionally they have Cream of Mushroom soup and it's fantastic! The drinks are tall & very often strong.  The waitresses are very friendly and the service is usually quick.   Conclusion: We go here probably once a month & it's almost always excellent!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=220

We had Yashanna R. and she really made our experience worth while. She went out of her way to make sure that all of our needs were met and satisfied. She told us to be honest and tell the truth because if we don't let her know then she doesn't know how to fix a problem.

Camille R.,"Los Angeles, United States",207,427,515,1.0,22/2/2012,"1.) As a new Yelper, I try not to review these big box joints because everyone knows about them and can make their own judgement about whether or not they're going to eat there. 2.) I really don't like this place and I don't know why I keep going back!! That all being said, the food is good and pretty consistent among the 3 or 4 different stores I've been to. The prices are outrageous and definitely not worth it. The cheesecake is just okay. I've had so much better and I hate that they have so many to choose from. As a matter of fact, I hate that the menu is as large as it is. It's annotying to have to flip through so many food choices and a lot of them look the same. The service... I've actually decided to write this review because of my last experience here. I came with a group of maybe 10 or more and everyone ordered a lot of food. Our server was nice though she left us hanging for awhile - be it to take our order, bring our bread, refill water, ask how we're doing, etc. She was nice to us and I know large groups can get crazy. Our entrees were starting to come out and the guy bringing them out was the biggest dick I've ever seen. He came over and screamed with an attitude that the plate was hot so don't touch it, okay?! Condesendingly he said, 'okay?!' again. As we were trying to make room for our food, he was yelling that we had to move more plates out of the way if we wanted our food, he rolled his eyes, snarled, yelled about moving more things out of the way, and slammed things down onto the table. As one of my friend's was moving a plate, he sntached it out of her hand and moved it himself.  I really wish I had said something, but I was having a good time with friends and didn't want to ruin our evening. As I was driving to the restaurant, I saw this guy smoking near the loading dock  on the side of the mall and thought about how disgusting it was to see him smoking right on the street. I knew he worked there from the white gear (anyone know why they have to wear ALL white?? That's gross, too) and hoped he wouldn't be our server. You'll usually find me here when large groups want to eat here and I don't really have a say. What a shame.

I actually planned for this meal and was really looking forward to it but was greatly dissapointed. BUFFALO BLASTS®  Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing Fried mush. They were kind of like huge fried raviolis with what looked like miniscule bits of chicken inside...goo... with some kind of  cheese. They were VERY oily which made the mush inside even less pleasant.  AVOCADO EGGROLLS    Chunks of Fresh Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Deep Fried in a Crisp Chinese Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce The dipping sauce was the best part of  this. The filling had absolutely no flavor at all. There is no way that one could tell that it had the ingredients above in it. It tasted like an unripe avocado smashed into a friend eggroll shell.  THE FACTORY BURGER  Charbroiled with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions. Served on Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf with Fries This ended up being an over-priced, over-greasy, Big Mac! The THREE pieces of bread were the size of my head and the ""special sauce"" aka Thousand Island dressing was hard to even find. They gave me a side of it which helped but could not salvage the dry, tastless burgers, sandwiched between these gigantic greasy bread patties. I took off 2.5 pieces of the bread and ate 3/4 of the burger. Yuck. The fries were extra boring..no taste...just greasy and boring. GODIVA® CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE    Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse this was ""okay"" but definitely not worth the calories or the price.

Barbara Ann B.,"Arlington, United States",124,21,2,1.0,1/8/2008,"I also lived through the ""Yelpers & The Cheesecake Factory"" ordeal, but I have a bit of a different story to tell.  I was so happy to find out that a Yelp event was happening on a Wednesday because that's the day that I have a sitter because I work late.  I finished up most of my work and hooked up with the crew at Cafe Rustica at the very end of office hours knowing that atleast some of us were heading to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake (and make quite a bit of it) and I have always loved the food at Cheesecake Factory.  So when we get there and there is an estimated 2 hour wait, I decide to go back to work while everyone is waiting to finish up and have them call me when our table was ready because I only work 10 minutes away. I go back to work and work for more than an hour, stop by Devon's to drop off some things that I had for her and the call from Ligaya comes that says that the table is almost ready. So I dart over to the Mall and I get a text from Becki saying that they are seated as I pull into the garage.   Cool, I have managed not to have to wait 2 hours for a table, my work was done so I can relax for a bit and hopefully get out of there within an hour or so and pick my son up in Roxbury by 11. How long could it take for them to serve pre-made, Pre-sliced cheesecake.  Some people ordered drinks, I think the table ordered one app total (at least that was all that I saw being brought to the table) but most of us just ordered cheesecake. I was told by my sitter that I could only stay out so late if I brought her back some cheesecake, so when I ordered I ordered one slice to go (at the regular price) and one slice for me to enjoy with my Yelp friends. After a while, I think at about the same time the app came to the table, a waiter came over with my to go slice of cheesecake. Cool, we will be served soon, right? After about 45 minutes of staring at my to go container of cheese cake, the Yelpers are wanting me to fork it over. But I can't, it's for Ann Marie!  I predict they have run out of cheesecake and they are waiting for the frozen cheesecakes to thaw before they serve us. So I decide to go over and find out what the hold up is and see if they can make my other slice of cheesecake to go also because I have to leave and pick up my son and it's already after 11. When I walk up, I see several people behind the counter with a few slices of cheesecake and not much happening. I ask what's going on and someone says, ""we are very busy and the only thing that people are ordering is Cheesecake and we are doing our best to get the Cheesecake out to your table"" I explained that I had to leave and was told that it would be out shortly.  One of the people behind the counter asked what I was waiting for so they could try to get it out first but the other woman cut her off and said ""They decided to have this big promotion today and we have 4 people working and all of these tables to serve, your food will be out shortly"" and I looked for the other woman who was trying to help get mine so that I could leave but she wasn't there anymore. I go back to the table thinking shortly, I can deal with shortly but we wait and wait and still no cheesecake. I am getting very annoyed because I know how long it takes to put a piece of cut cheesecake on a plate and put some whipped cream on it. If you have 4 people doing it, one person gets the cheesecake, one person plates the cheesecake, one person garnishes with whipped cream and one person makes sure the order is right and passes on to the server. There is no cutting involved, it doesn't really matter how many slices you have to serve in a night.  If you run out, go back to the table and say ""I am sorry, we have run out of the chocolate, can I offer you something else""  I hit my boiling point because I was too deep into it to just walk out empty handed, I was past the point of no return it is now almost Midnight and I want my $1.50 cheesecake!! Give it to me so I can leave!!! One of the yelpers gets up to go to the ladies room and comes back and says there's no TP, I stood up again and said that there will be TP in there shortly (because, damn it I have to pee too) and i get up to go tell one of the people that are standing around chatting, that they need TP in the ladies room but I was headed off by the woman who told me that our food would be out shortly.  She had two plates with cheesecake in her hand and she was walking in our direction and said ""it's coming, it's coming"" so I go sit down (funny, how l no longer need to pee so bad) and she walks right by our table, WTF! A few minutes later our cheesecake actually comes and I wolf down a few bites and throw the rest into one of my take out containers (I had two because they put the strawberries on the side) handed Becki some cash, said a quick Bye and Ran! I got to my son at 12:45, I was in Big Trouble! Thanks CCF!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260
Marc C.,"Boston, United States",176,110,29,1.0,31/7/2008,"*UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, I refuse to credit them for our humor... ________ I apologize ahead for length, but it needed to be covered (I guarantee - my longest review ever). Here's some basic math equations for this visit: Entire experience - my fellow diners + time involved = EPIC FAIL! Entire experience + [my fellow diners + Visit to Dante's + time involved  (absurdity +lack of attentiveness +lack of manager response)] x booze x laughter = the only reason that this review gets 2 stars  OK , well that and the fact that I am unable to give a zero... Our group decided that we need to go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheesecake Day with $1.50 slices of cheesecake. You would think they would be prepared, but I digress... So we all arrive at the restaurant with a party of 16. We are given a quoted wait time (after an agitated sigh from the hostess- ever so welcoming) of 2 hours... no problem, expected... change the number to 12, quoted a wait time of 1 1/2-2 hours. The bar didn't have space for us, so we decide to skip (almost literally) over to Dante's across the street for fun, frivolity, and alcohol. The pager wouldn't work over there so our quick thinking leader gives a phone number to call us so we can relax in comfort (this isn't a review for Dante's so I'll skip that). After 2 hours we head back to CF and finally get seated at the 2 1/2 hour mark.  The server (Paco) was nice and friendly got the food and drink orders. Two more people showed while he is taking orders, no problem, the table next to us left and it was added. Took a little while to get the drinks, but no problem. My martini was room temperature and I did not get the side of rocks I requested... ok, larger group, I'll deal. So we ordered drinks, 1 appetizer, and 13 (that should have been an omen, guys) slices of cheesecake for here, 2 to go. Server comes back, they are out of the appetizer ordered- no problem, ordered a different Appetizer which came out in about 10-15 minutes. Then we waited... And laughed with each other and waited... The two to go slices arrive... And laughed with each other and waited (notice a pattern)... Look around, tables seated after us got their food and desserts... and all the servers are sitting around the front of the restaurant chatting away. Meanwhile no drink refills were offered and most of us ran out of water (those that did actually did have water poured some of theirs into their neighbors empty glasses). We actually felt we were not being attended to because the server knew the gratuity would be added to the party. One of us gets up and informs the manager of our situation as we sit in the near empty dining room. Server comes back, I ask for water refills, they are refilled within 5 minutes. And we laughed with each other and waited (at this point for over an hour)... Another member informs the manager we still don't have our cheesecake. Another server comes by and tells us there are only four people working in the dessert pantry (I have been in the business for 20 years and know that is insufficient for this night), OK, how about planning ahead?  And we laughed with each other and waited... Finally, after 1 hour and 25 minutes of being seated, the cheesecake arrives. Delirious to see the Holy Grail of our quest, we dig in... it was good, although two of them were still frozen, but we dealt with it. Besides the restaurant was nearly empty and they were mopping around us- bathroom trip and exit from restaurant included sliding feet-- how about clean water, wet floor signs, and waiting until guests leave next time). I did not order a second drink since I was already over it. We get the bill, nothing was adjusted, but the gratuity was still added (of course). It also would have been nice if the manager visited the table and at least acknowledged the problem. The kicker after we paid? The server (Paco) came over and confronting us about speaking to the manager and stated that she yelled at the servers in front of their gossip gathering. He also stated that they ran out of cheesecakes... hello... planning ahead? Or how about letting us know so we can select another instead of frozen ones? Summary thus far: 4 1/2+ hour cheesecake, good but not that good.  Second kicker? We got out so late the subway stopped running and the car was locked in the parking garage and we had to get a security guard zipping around on a Segway to let us out. So if you want to go next year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day, I suggest the following alternative- July is also National: July Belongs to Blueberries Month, Ice Cream Month, National Baked Beans Month (feel free to make the beans yourself from scratch- you'd still get them faster than the cheesecake...) As for me, next year, I may wait for 08 Aug and celebrate National Sneak Some Zucchini on Your Neighbor's Porch Night (I swear I did not just make that up) with the great people I dined with...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260

Leighann F.,"New York, United States",3243,961,695,2.0,31/7/2008,"Recently added to my list of things that one should never admit in public: I waited a total of 4.5 hours to eat a $1.50 slice of cheesecake. From a chain restaurant. In honor of National Cheesecake Day. Before I hang my head i shame, I must say that the cost/benefit analysis of this experience was only positive because these 4.5 hours were spent with some fabulous yelpers and a bit of alcohol. Two and a half hours total waiting time for a table (which was spent sipping cocktails at Dante across the street) and another two hours waiting for the cheesecakes to arrive to our table!  I WISH I was kidding you. Now, I understand that this promotional deal probably caused quite the hullabaloo for the staff at Cheesecake and a table of fourteen threw just another wrench into the mix, but seriously...TWO HOURS for a slice of cheesecake?  Two hours when other tables that sat after us got their slices way before us? Two hours when your entire staff is standing up at the dessert counter goofing off and completely ignoring our table because we met the requirements for auto-gratuity and they were going to get their tip no matter what?! I assume that this corporate promotion was well planned and each chain was well-informed of this event long ago, so my question is how on earth are you not better prepared?

Ricky R.,"Austin, United States",38,13,,1.0,31/7/2008,"As all my National Cheesecake Day cohorts have already weighed in on the lengthy fiasco, I feel compelled to opine on the matter myself.  Also because I am told one must review something to be considered a ""yelper.""  But I digress.  On most days, Cheesecake Factory is not a single star establishment.  National Cheesecake Day is not most days. You might think that a factory which turns out cheesecake would be equipped to handle the wave of pilgrims on cheesecake's holiest of days.  You would be mistaken.  You might think that the departure of all the other restaurant patrons (having already been served and finished their meals) would cause your cheesecakes to appear.  Again, you would be mistaken.  You might think that that after being ignored for about an hour the wait staff would eschew sass in favor of a kind, conciliatory tone.  You would again be mistaken.  You might even think that they would throw in an extra slice or sing as song as though it were your birthday with the cheesecakes finally do arrive.  Sadly, you would be mistaken yet again. I won't get into the minutiae of the evening, as that has been more eloquently done by others, so I'll sum up my review as follows: Start with 5 stars for $1.50 slice of cheesecake, subtract 1 star for every hour it takes to get said cheesecake.  In our case, this leaves you with 1 star.  (If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt and not count the wait time for the table, then take off those other two stars anyway for their lack of compassion.) As mentioned elsewhere, the company of the yelpers and the merriment that was made was a 5-star affair.  The Factory had little to do with this, however, so they're still stuck with 1. Who'da thunk my first yelp would be such a burn?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260
Christopher M.,"Concord, United States",271,541,15,2.0,31/7/2008,"My most recent experience at the Cheesecake Factory was with a dozen other Yelpers who seem to be covering every detail of the evening in excruciating detail, which means I get to write a brief review (for once).  Thanks guys! Every experience I've ever had with the Cheesecake Factory has involved waiting.  I don't know if they invented the little vibrating pagers, but they've taken their use to an almost sadistic level.  I used to work at a bookstore in a mall next to a Cheesecake Factory, and I guarantee that 60% of our sales during dinner time were from people waiting for their table at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes, the food is pretty good.  Yes, those avocado egg rolls are AMAZING.  Yes, some people have developed romantic relationships with the cheesecake.  But after my last visit involved  over four hours of waiting for a single slice of cheesecake, I think takeout is now the only acceptable form of dining at the Cheesecake Factory. EDIT: and I almost forgot, they were OUT of the egg rolls!  WTF?!?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=260

Nope, nope, it's the lack of exercise. Nope, it's the South and their chicken fried steak fried pork. But they'd all be wrong. Because I think I know why. After you wake up tomorrow, right before the stroke of noon, drive over to your nearest Cheesecake Factory or order something. Anything. And they'll ask you if you want a lunch-sized portion. Tell them no, hell no, what are you, a smelly European. Then after you get your lunch, finish every bite on the plate, and finish off with a signature slice of not-very-good cheesecake. Now, go home, it's hot outside, and take a nice nap. You'll need it after the long drive to the mall. Then repeat this process each day for a month. Don't worry, the Cheesecake Factory has over 20,000 different entree's to choose from. Their menu is so long they had to include advertisements. Then write to me documenting your weight and body shape changes after that month diet of Cheesecake Factory.

I think both parts of my personality were tested last night when 11 other Yelpers, plus a few friends... ventured here for National Cheesecake day. Mind you, we get there... find out it's a 2 hour wait, and consider the possibility of just buying whole cheesecakes, and go out somewhere else to eat them. Roni and I check out the scene, but we quickly realize that a $45 cheesecake/12 = $3.75 per person.... and we want our $1.50 cheesecake damnit! So, by choice we keep our name down for the 2+ hour wait, head to Dante for some drinks (about $10 for one), and then head back to Cheesecake factory for our $1.50 slice ... which took for-ev-er to arrive. To the Cheesecake Factory for next years Cheesecake day - be more prepared. The lack of staff that you had on hand was highly disappointing. Next time, screw the $1.50 slice - which ended up costing me way more than the $3.75 when you throw in the alcohol at the other venue while we waited - I'll be down for getting the whole cheesecake and popping a squat for an impromptu picnic.

Try not to go there on weekends because it gets really packed and the service is really slow. The scene is mostly college kids. The decor is pretty amazing. ...I'd say! Your day starts off by the waiter asking what you would like to drink, and if you don't already know what you want to eat prepare to be stuck looking at the menu for 20 extra minutes before he or she comes back to ask if your ready. I mean, the prices aren't that bad. Depends what your getting... The burgers are huge! My favorite was the bacon bbq cheesebuger ($10.98 if i can recall) My mouth waters from the thought of it .. ooh the delight!  Their meals are very quick to fill you up on an empty stomach. But I'd say very fattening...(not good for anyone on a diet) Only thing that I don't like about their burgers is the cheese. (sorta plastic for some reason)  But any who, the fries were great, and my waiter was so sweet I had to give a good tip. =-] I work at the mall so I've been in and out a few times, WARNING. ordering to go is the worst on weekends!

But generally speaking, it shouldn't be bad because its corporate and they drill into you the fear that you'll get ""mystery shopped"" (if you get a low score you get canned). If you have any problem, I'm sure that management will be eager to get it resolved.  As far as the food goes, its above average. They have all these different ethnic choices - wide ranging - and some are pretty decent. In my time there, I tried everything. I liked the tuna tataki salad - a bit steep price wise, but really great. I've sought out something that comes close but its really actually great. The Thai Chicken Pasta is pretty decent too for a non-Thai joint.  Also, they have some good drinks - the frozen iced mango and frozen iced raspberry are awesome.

I think the prices are reasonable, the portions are great, the cheesecake is overpriced, but you usually don't have room for it anyway. The bread you get before the meal is even great. The only downside is that it's ALWAYS crowded. But the good thing is that it's usually in a mall, so you can just grab a pager, and walk around during your wait. It's not an ordinary casual dinner or anything, but it's fancy enough to go on a date or after a show in the town.

Kathy K.,"Cambridge, United States",10,81,48,2.0,18/12/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory sort of treds water, neither sinking nor advancing in my opinion rating every time I visit it.  I have never been there without one of three things being out of whack during that visit.  Here are the three areas that seem to take turns being an issue: 1.   I pick an entree that is better ordered at an actual Italian, Thai or other ethnic restaurant.  Ineveitably, I am sad as I have definitely had said dish better at the less expensive neighborhood joint.  In the worst case, I could swear the Lean Cuisine frozen version was better. 2.  Some member of the staff who happens to be somehow responsible for either seating, serving or bussing my table is confused, oblivious or on break.  If I am successful in picking a tasty entree, somewhere the chain of custody of my dining experience is broken. 3.  Lastly - but maybe the most damning factor that dashes my meal if 1 and 2 go well -- my fellow patrons are morons.  Maybe by choosing to dine in the mall I am welcoming this, but it still is just wrong. This restaurant has an alarmingly high rate of babies and kids stretched beyond nap time, really loud teenagers often using really loud profanity, and people that have more bags, strollers and assorted packages than their allotted floor space. All in all, it can be a really taste, convenient and good time, but it can also crash and burn pretty violently.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=280
David A.,"Brooklyn, United States",379,684,63,4.0,29/10/2008,"Want a great deal? Come here 4-6 pm M-Fri and hit up the bar. Happy hour for food. The avocado egg roll and Spicy Ahi tempera were to die for.  Chicken Potstickers were eh. I'm not a huge fan of potstickers, so I figure I'm biased. Same goes for the spring rolls. The sliders were decent, but nothing to write home about. Neither were the lettuce wraps. Order 2 of the bar menu items and you'll be stuffed. 3 is probably just right for a couple. We ordered 4 and were in a food coma. If you want dinner, they serve past midnight, so they're great for a late night snack or dinner post party munchies.  The salads are good. The kobe beef burger was pretty good. The navajo sandwich was OK. The guacamole chips were amazing, but the salsa sucked. Can't go wrong with the tasty drinks.  The service is usually pretty good. The waiters/waitresses pay a lot of attention to you and are pretty friendly and chatty.  How to get there? Take the green line Lechmere train, 69 bus, or drive. There's street parking and INEXPENSIVE mall parking in the garage. Take a romantic stroll by the Charles before or after. It's pretty.  Want to avoid the crowds?

Ryan R.,"Beverly, United States",7,19,1,1.0,26/5/2007,"I actually like Cheesecake factory, as other people have said, chain restaurants arent normally my thing, but its ok.  This particular one though, awful.  It scored low in just about every category a restaurant can, wait staff, food quality / quantity, interior design, general company, any others I should mention? To start with the wait staff, they were completely ridiculous.  The waiter that we had among other things introduced himself three times, which I can understand maybe hes a little stressed, but I think we were the only people there that werent a) old, or b) swarming with children, so a little easier to spot.  Im pretty sure he introduced himself, we ordered drinks, then he came, introduced himself again, asked for our drinks again...and so on.  Another waitress woman we saw slinking by our table was carrying some plates to another table and proceeded to wipe her nose on her arm WHILE carrying the plates still. As for the food quality vs. quantity, all of the dishes are basically colored styrofoam in a pile with awful crunchy rice.  I ordered Orange Chicken that was in my opinion way too orange visually and taste-wise and piled high on top of some undercooked rice.  As for the edamame (soy beans), dont EVER order them, they were so overcooked the pods fell apart, for those of you who enjoy edamame, thats NOT supposed to happen! One quick last thing, the interior is a disaster, its like early Egyptian / Greco-Roman / Rennaissance / Baroque / Art Deco and a melange of other perhaps Cheesecake Factory-invented styles. Overall, awful!

Dachary C.,"Cambridge, United States",44,126,,4.0,24/5/2006,"Yummy food. Great drinks. Long waits. The Cheesecake Factory is a recent discovery for me, but one that I'm very pleased to have made. The first time I tried to go, I got turned off by the 45 minute wait to seat 1 and elected to leave. On subsequent visits, though, it was a pleasant experience. If you get there early (between 5-6) the wait isn't bad, even on a Friday night. On a weekend mealtime, though, waits are steadily long, so don't go if you're in a hurry. But if you get stuck waiting, you can always peruse the mall while you're killing time. Or use the time productively by reading the novel-length menu to start trying to decide what you want. An added pro: the bar is open seating, so start with a drink while you wait. Ahh, yes - the drinks. The Cheesecake Factory has a section of four ""Super Creamy"" signature drinks - I have now tried them all, and can safely conclude that they're all fantastic! If you've got a hankering for girly drinks, definitely try one. Warning, though: in the Flying Gorilla and the Strawberry Creamsicle, you can't even taste the alcohol - generally resulting in sucking them down far too quickly and going back for more. I find those types of drinks particularly dangerous. The menu is voluminous and very diverse. No matter what you're in the mood for, you should find something here to satisfy you. The food is very good quality and full of flavor. Do *not* expect to eat a full portion, though - either plan to split it with someone or take leftovers home. The serving sizes are easily two meals, especially if you elect an appetizer or dessert. And you will probably only be able to handle one or the other - if you're going to have an entree, be warned that appetizer + entree = no room for dessert. Likewise, entree + dessert = no room for appetizer. Eating here is definitely about picking and choosing. The tab can get expensive - especially if you add drinks and appetizer/desert. I've easily spent $80-$100 for two people. But if you're in the mood for good food and don't mind waiting to be seated and having to sift through a zillion menu choices, this is the place to go.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=280

So last night, the boy and I were hungry.  It was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten dinner yet.  A quick search showed us that The Similians would be open.  Yay!  As the boy's never tried it, I decided to bring him there.  Alas, they closed at 10 and it was now 10:30.  Then my friend called to pick up stuff from my place.  By the time we were ready to go out again to eat, it was 11:30 pm and the boy's stomach was cursing at me in Urdu, a language he doesn't even know! We were resigned to do take-out and both lukewarm on the idea.  But lo and behold, The Cheesecake Factory was open till 12:30 am!  Score #1 for TCF!  He was lukewarm on the idea and normally I'd never go there, being lukewarm on the idea of chain restaurants but I have always heard the myth of TCF, but till I moved here last year, didn't believe it actually existed.  Curiousity got the better of me. We came in and were seated immediately.  11:30 pm at night really is the best time to go, I guess.  We ordered an appetizer to share and an entree each.  What were we thinking?!?!?  These things were GINORMOUS!  It's ok, though, b/c we ended up having so much to take home.  And for a chain, the food quality was surprisingly good, so it's stuff that I definitely didn't mind taking home.  The waitress was also so sweet and helpful.  We had a really good experience there.

I went here once for my boyfriend's friend's birthday party - it was a party of 20 and we had reservations yet they were still about an hour and a half late getting us our table. I can sort of understand that as it was Saturday night, but still, we had reservations - you'd think they be better prepared. Once we got our table, the service was very good. We had one waitress to the whole table and she was very good at handling everyone's drink orders and dinner orders - so I had to give it 2 stars for great service. Unfortunately, the food was something that was obviously frozen and microwaved. It tasted very fake and I was not impressed (I had the quesadillas). My boyfriend had a turkey sandwich or burger, and I could see him grimacing all throughout the meal. Thinking that dessert would be the highlight of our evening, we ordered the cheesecake (we are both cheesecake lovers by the way) we heard so much about. We couldn't finish one slice - it was way too sweet and thick. We were not impressed and didn't understand why it was so highly rated. I'm sure others like it, but we weren't too happy with the quality of the food. It's definitely a fun atmosphere for large crowds and the prices are moderate - I'll give it that.

FELICIA F.,"Suffolk, United States",0,5,,3.0,28/3/2010,"My major gripe about this place is the wait for a table. There is always a long wait. After a few visits, I have decided that I don't even like their food, so now I only go for cheesecake. I thorougly enjoy bypassing the mopes waiting for a table (for nasty food and uncomforatably close seating) and go right to the counter to order my multiple slices of delicious cheesecake. This has been my thing more recently. Well the last time I visited this establishment (for cheesecake only), it was a semi disaster. First I asked the employee if they had the red velvet cheesekcake (because I did not see it in the case) and she said yes and pointed it to me. Of course I jumped all over that and asked for a piece of that and the banana creme cheesecake. My boyfriend (who worked in the food industry forever) noticed she had been handling money or something and needed fresh gloves, so he immediately reminded her of that before she began slicing up my cheesecake. He placed his order and we took a seat on the bench. This is where I'll add that for some odd reason, I do enjoy the decor of this place. Anyway we pay for cakes and go home. Upon arrival at home, I am absolutely horrified when I discover my red velvet order was somehow mistaken for apple crisp or something. How in the world did she screw that up after the animated conversation we had?! At this point, I am infuriated that I had to deal with Cambridgeside Galleria and the miscreants who frequent it, only to come home with the wrong order. I phone the place and speak to a manager who very insincerely apologizes and asks me to come back and get my cake. I respond with a no and she responds by putting me on hold forever. Finally she returns and offers to send me a $10 gift certificate. I accept.

Greg S.,"Arlington, United States",2,116,,4.0,30/12/2007,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, for many different reasons, The selection on the menu is huge, the prices may seem high but here is a simple solution, don't gorge yourself and bring home leftovers and you have 2 meals, when you factor that in it actually really isn't all that bad because their portions are huge. For instance the meatloaf which I think is really good is like half a meatloaf. Anyway, I've tried a lot of different things on the menu, most of the pasta dishes, orange chicken, some of the steak items, the brunch menu is really good, and you can always get the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito which is really good. I've also tried a lot of their cheesecake which you can get to go or buy a smaller or larger cake to go, the smaller ones are usually plenty big enough because you can cut small pieces for about ten people and they are filling. I've tried the Oreo, plain, Snickers, carrot cake, and pumpkin and they are all fantastic.

I've been there twice: the first time for a salad, which was approaching mediocre but couldn't quite make it; the second time for fish tacos, which were a complete abomination, and an insult to every foodstuff included, not to mention the intended victim--me. A week ago I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego at Rubio's--a cheap fast-food joint that serves fish tacos. I liked them. So I tried them when I got back to Cambridge, and figured I'd try 'em at TCF--at 4 times the price, they should be at least decent, right? WRONG! The tortillas, which for some odd reason were doubled on each taco, tasted bland, there was WAY too much unseasoned cabbage (about 80% of the filling, by my estimate), and at the bottom was some oddly tasteless fish that had some kind of coloring that one would think might be seasoning. But one would be wrong. It has to just be food coloring. There was ""pico de gallo"" on the side, consisting of diced tomatoes and nothing else (God save us from anything like seasoning or spice!), along with a lump of what they consider guacamole--presumably a lump of old library paste that had green food coloring added and a couple of pencil erasers. This was one of the blandest meals I've ever had... oh, and another thing, there was a drop of special sauce in each of the tacos--I know, because that one drop that was supplied fell on my shirt, where I got a chance to taste it. It wasn't bad. But what's with the rationing? Are we having a national fish taco sauce shortage? Did I not have enough rationing stamps? The meal came with rice (yellow minute rice with bird's eye vegetable bits thrown in) and black beans (possibly the high point of the meal--not too much to screw up between the can and the plate). To sum up, the food tastes awful, the service is unusually busy, and hence have no time for actual individual interaction with customers, and the prices are outlandish.

My sister and I got there soon after they started serving breakfast, around 10am. We were seated at a two person booth type table in the bar area. The place wasn't busy at all. I think it was due to getting there so early. The breakfast menu has changed since the last time I went for breakfast= but it was still good and filling. The orange juice is half pulp which I HATE! That is why I gave it three stars instead of 4.

Chrissy H.,"Portland, United States",180,328,116,3.0,14/1/2007,"When shopping in the Cambridgeside galleria, bring a little extra money and a bit of extra time to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The food court at the mall leaves little to be desired and no where else can you find the yummy warm oatmeal bread the CCF serves before your meal. (you also get a little loaf of sourdough) The portions of everything are so huge and the price is so medium. I advise ordering an appetizer for a meal or splitting an entree. Even the salads are gigantic! You basically get an entire garden. The menu is actually a short book of cocktails (I like the peach Bellini,) appetizers (the sweet tamale corn cakes are to die for,) salads (even the plain garden salad is tasty,) entrees (chicken stuffed tortillas are so bomb,) and of course cheesecake (I enjoy the strawberry cheesecake or the Linda's fudge cake.) Just remember that if you just can't stuff anymore food into your belly, you can always have dessert to go. A few things to keep in mind when dining at CCF:      Expect a wait. It's by far the most popular establishment in the mall so you can expect to be on at least a 30 minute waiting list during peak dining hours.      Expect to spend quite a bit of money if you order alcoholic beverages and dessert because they are not cheap and add up fast!     Be aware that the waitstaff isn't always top notch but you'll always get your food in a timely manner. The one time we didn't, the manager came by and picked up the check for us.     And if you work or live in or near the mall you can always order take out. You might have to hold for 5 minutes before someone takes your order but it's worth it. If you order a beverage on take out, make sure they remember to give it to you because they have forgotten mine on multiple occasions.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=320

You have to wait forever, yes, but at least at this location you can browse around the mall while you wait.  The menu is huge so no matter who you are with, someone will find something they can eat and at a very fair price. Vegans, vegetarians, carnivores, kids, adults, teens, etc they will all be able to find something on the menu. Personally I feel as if a lot of their items are too bland and soggy, but for the price, amount of food, and fact that it's a chain, it's not all that bad. I kept hearing about how good their steaks were and finally tried one. It was very good. the mashed potatoes were also yummy. I got the surf and turf another time (steak and salmon) which was also very good. Stay away from the soggy fish tacos and most of the pastas are overcooked and blah. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so me saying I don't like it here doesn't really mean much, but I'll say it anyway.

I rarely get an appetizer or dessert for that matter.  I always bring the dessert home instead of eating it in the restaurant because i'm usually too stuffed from the bread and entree. My favorites are the Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/chicken & roasted garlic.  Love them!  I've only had one bad meal there and it was the meatloaf.  Not your typical meatloaf and i learned my lesson, so now i order with caution. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer is amazing but i think i felt my heart stop mid-bite.  Not for the health conscious. Note: I'm not sure if anyone else will agree, but i've gotten take-out here several times and it NEVER tastes as good as when i dine-in.  The food always tastes much blander.  I don't get it, but it's a bummer.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=320

It's a huge chain with the kind of crazy-huge portions that make people hate America. There's nothing inventive or unique about the food.

I have been to this restaurant countless times and have never been disappointed. The service is good and the prices are perfectly reasonable. Plus, that eight-pound tome they call a menu makes the Cheesecake Factory the perfect destination for a group with highly variable tastes.  From first bite to last bite, everything is always tasty. On more than one occasion, I've requested refills of just that honey wheat bread (what do they put in it to make it taste so good? crack?). Their new, horribly-named Skinnylicious Menu has great options for people who want something lighter than the restaurant's standard fare. I'm a big fan of both the tuscan chicken and the BLT. Want a fattylicious meal instead? No problem -- get yourself a trough of cajun pasta or a burger roughly the size of your face. The dessert choices are plentiful and coma-inducingly good.

Miguel R.,"Yucca Valley, United States",0,8,2,4.0,19/8/2014,"Note: If this review was based solely on food, it would be a three star review. I was a bit skeptical to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in CambridgeSide  after my first (and I thought it would be the last) experience, at The Cheesecake Factory, in Rancho Mirage, California. A friend wanted to change my view on it, since she loved the place. I gave in and hoped that the food and service were better this time. I was content with the experience. We were seated right away. The waitress was very nice and brought our drinks quickly. It was, again, a hassle deciding on something given that the menu is tremendously long. After about 15-20 minutes of deliberation we all decided what we were to eat. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish contained shrimp and chicken sauteed with tomato, onions and peppers in a ""very spicy cajun sauce;"" it wasn't spicy, there was a hint of pepper in the dish, but not enough to make your tongue burn. The food was brought relatively fast given the amount of people in the restaurant. The dish was a colorful mixture of reds and oranges that expelled a delicious odor accented with spices and roasted tomatoes. I was hoping the dish didn't disappoint, like my previous experience. I dove in. The pasta in combination with the meats and the vegetables resulted in a mouthwatering experience. The flavor was there, no doubt about it. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The tomatoes were bright and complemented the meats well. Both, the shrimp and chicken went very well together, despite how weird the combination may seem. As we ate, the waitress would stop by and ask how the dishes were and was constantly refilling our drinks. My only complaint was that the dish was a bit too greasy, I understand that the sauté everything on the same pan and put everything on the plate; however, the food would have been much easier to eat if I hadn't had to carefully take the pasta from my plate up to my mouth as I was afraid the dripping grease would stain my clothes.

Peachy L.,"York, United Kingdom",6,41,2,2.0,24/2/2010,"I love the cheesecake factory. My boyfriend has always hated it though and now I agree he truely has a reason why.  We went in today for lunch ( he brought me to make me happy) but probably will never go back.  We got our food (mine was fine) he got a baked potato soup. He thought he didn't feel good because we hadn't ate till almost 3pm and went outside for air. When he came back in he started in on his soup again. Not a minute after he was holding his water glass up over his mouth. I yelled "" if you're going to throw up run to the bathroom!"" and he did.... And he puked. That was the signal to leave so we got our salads to go and left.  When we were there he made it very well known he has a severe apple allergie and asked for his salad with out it. The waitress assured us that there would be no apple in his chopped salad. Just now we dig into our leftovers. We had asked for dressing but were given none. He takes a bite and 20 seconds he starts coughing and runs to the sink. What was in it??? APPLE. So for the last ten mins he's been drinking milk and has taken benedryl. Luckily it was only one bite. One more and we could be heading to the er right now. His allergy is so severe that his throat can close.  We both work in the restaurant industry and know there are allergy alert buttons  on the computer systems and also it can be grounds for termination if your carelessness causes someone a severe allergy attack.  Needless to say nice waitress or not we will never be going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Alain T.,"Orange County, United States",141,364,921,1.0,1/10/2012,"The review is based strictly on the service.  My hotel happened to be across from this restaurant and decided to eat here on our first night. I've been to other Cheesecake restaurants in the past and their food has always been consistent and above average. However, the service in this restaurant is horrendous. The waiter has no business working here as he completely lacked customer service skills. He completely ignored our party for most of the night. Never came for refills, kept forgetting what we had ordered for dinner. Acted completely aloof and generally a total ass to our party. Terrible job and definitely lost my business my next visit in town.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
David Y.,"Waltham, United States",91,453,3,2.0,9/8/2010,"What can be said about this place that you don't already know?  Unimaginative food.  Big quantities (except for the green chile burger I got) and average or below average quality.  My green chile burger I would call smaller than expected and lacking flavor, even with jalapenos and chipotle mayo.  For $9, was on their cheaper side of the menu but I didn't really want to come here in the first place.  I got a tall $7 beer but it still made for a disappointing meal.  Service was generally fine but I could see how they could be slow if there were more than half packed full.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Jamie B.,"Boston, United States",154,8,6,1.0,5/12/2011,"I need to start off by saying OMG! Cheesecake Factory is not really my style, saying that my friend works at the galleria and we wanted to get a quick bite with a drink. This was by far the worst dinning experience I have ever encountered in all of my year... We walk in and no one is at the desk NO HOSTESS ON A SUNDAY NIGHT?!?! really we finally get seated and was not greeted for a good 17 minutes, I know because I texted the boo telling him where I was.. Finally I flag my waitress down and we try to order, she was confused to say the least. she wasnt sure if it was her table or not... We tell the waitress that we need to catch the 11 pm it was 9:30 when we had arrived in and now its 10ish.. so I order my tangueray with SODA water, she was confused she didn't know what tangueray was and couldn't understand I wanted SODA water and extra limes, I politely explained it was gin. my friend orders a strawberry Margarita.... so we wait... The drinks show up and I have NO LIMES and my drink is deff tonic and my friends drink is a Mango Margarita, I ask for some limes after we order a few smallplates we ordered  -fried mac and cheese balls -thai lettuce wraps  -a flat bread pizza She shows up flustered and with no limes saying she waiting for our food... so we wait.... I mean these are quick dishes why is it taken 30 mins when the place is dead? Some other waiter brings our food.. The food... -fried mac and cheese-the sauce under the mac balls was burnt,stuck to the plate.. *still good but not the best I have ever had -the flat bread pizza was burnt and dry *really, really?!?!  -Thai lettuce wraps were good so we waited for our waitress to come back and check up on us and she never did, we had to ask a busser for water refills... when she finally came back she said I know you girls are in a rush heres the check, after she presented it she asked about the food I told her we didn't really like the flat bread and she said well now you know what to not order next time and went on to talk about how amazing the mac balls were. I paid the bills and we finished eating because we stlll weren't done, she tried to clear the plates while my friend was still cutting her mac ball.. she brings back the bills and I sign and we are getting ready to leave and she comes running over flustered saying she needed my credit card again because she voided the Transaction, I handed over my card reluctantly and asked how i know I am not being charged twice, she said you aren't you will see on your statement..... but if you see your charged twice CCF will refund you REALLY!?!?!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Beck N.,"Roxbury, United States",31,280,86,3.0,7/3/2010,"This place is pretty much exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory.  Typically I sit at the bar & while there is almost always a seat, I feel like I'm too close for comfort with my neighbors at the bar...& thus end up awkwardly bumping elbows with strangers.

Lynne C.,"Everett, United States",0,12,,3.0,2/1/2010,"OK, admittedly, I'm a plebeian who frequents chain restaurants. When the Factory first opened, I was young and impressed - quasi fusion dishes, seemingly funky decor... But now, the love affair has ended and even the once noteworthy cheesecake tastes chain-y. First, quite simply this place is overpriced (even if the rumors are true and they give diners 1 lb. & a 1/4 of pasta). 10 dollars for a slice of cheesecake? That's ridiculous. Go to an Italian community and buy a whole cheesecakefor the same price! Next, the food is TOO oily - I'm talking Paula Deen here folks!  I had the Evelyn pasta at Thanksgiving time, and some pesto dish right before Christmas. The Evelyn dish was bland and grease-filled. The pasta itself was a little too al dente and it appeared dessicated, as if had been under the warmer too long. The most recent time, with the pesto dish, there was so much oil that I had to put paper napkins in my plate to absorb the excess! Of course, I should have spoken up. However, the waiter walked by twice and blithely pretended not to notice. On a side note, there was a little verbal spat between two of the waitstaff. How gauche; they should have gone into the kitchen. Don't do it. Your money is better spent in the South End, or some quirky place in Allston/Brighton or Davis Sq.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Brian G.,"Brooklyn, United States",52,265,20,3.0,21/11/2009,"I usually would give the Cheesecake Factory a 1 star but this was probably the best visit I've ever had to one. We were desperate because we were hungry after work and went here because California Pizza Kitchen across the hall closes at 9:30p and this place closes at 11p.  I hate the suburban-esque Orlando style they have here, but this time wasn't so bad- I gave them a 2. The service was great I have to say the waiter was very nice, accommodating, and gave me a to go cup of mint tea. The Louisiana chicken pasta was decent- the pasta and sauce was pretty good, but the chicken was fried, dry, and bland.  Overall, this was the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I usually have a bad attitude coming in because i hate their mall style and tacky approach to food, but this brightened up my demeanor towards this chain just a tad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Michele H.,"Cambridge, United States",10,84,,2.0,12/7/2010,"I've made a huge mistake. This place gets two stars in lieu of one purely because of their incredible Passion Fruit Mojito.  I don't feel incredibly rewarded, however, because the delicious drink put a $10 before tip dent in my wallet. Foodwise, I ordered two small plates--a plate of stuffed mushrooms, and a mushroom pizzette.  Yes, I love mushrooms.  I would eat mushrooms stuffed in mushrooms. When it arrived, the pizzette looked essentially like two slices of TOAST with cheese, sauce, and mushrooms on top.  It tasted even worse.  The stuffed mushrooms weren't too bad, but after consuming the meal, I felt the mushrooms evolved angry fists that were punching out the lining of my stomach. I can understand (though not appreciate!) getting sick after eating maybe a bad cut of meat.  But I ate MUSHROOMS!  Is their food so un-fresh that even the mushrooms can make you sick here?

Dawn E.,"Somerville, United States",17,61,,4.0,23/1/2009,"I KNOW. Just hear me out.  I received a gift card, and it was a snowy Sunday and we felt like a walk and also some gooey, cheesy, abundance. All signs point to the CF. Helpful hint if you've never been there: it's a good idea to know what you might be in the mood for before you get there because the menu will overwhelm you and you'll order in haste and the whole enterprise will be roo-eened. Friends recommended the fried mac & cheese appetizer and I'm glad they steered me in that direction. What you get are four of these crispy, salty, creamy bombs of deep-fried artery busting food art arranged on a platter of better-than-average, eat-with-a fork-marinara. The were so rich I could only eat one, but they were just as good warmed up the next day. Also: nachos. I am very picky about my nachos, and I know I'm always risking disappointment when I order from a new place, but our server said they were good so we went for it. I must say, well played, Cheesecake Factory. Their 'chos are nothing fancy, just a solid example to show to places that insist on stacking up the dry chips. What is that? CF does the one-layer method, every chip enrobed in baked cheese, studded with jalapenos and served with a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream, plus salsa on the side. They're also quite voluminous.  The Cheesecake Factory does not boast an impressive beer list, but a 22 oz. Sam on draft suited my needs just fine.  Overall I'd be loath to come here on a weekend night, and I can't speak for the entrees or even the famous cheesecake, but for my appetizer-happy self everything was just right.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
Matt P.,"Boston, United States",7,13,,2.0,12/4/2010,"The menu is humongous here - we had to reference dishes we were looking at by page number. I guess maybe you could use that to recommend to parties? I found it a bit overwhelming. Our table started off with some sliders. These tasted like your average, very thin, over-cooked hamburger with very few toppings. You can fill in the rest. I followed up with fish tacoes, which I had never had. The fish was cooked too long, so that it was hard to tell that it was fish, and the salsa was tasteless. I had a bite of my friend's cheesecake. The eponymous dish is, at least, pretty good.

Sara M.,"Boston, United States",92,507,5,3.0,3/9/2009,"I swear, EVERY mall in America has a Cheesecake Factory.  They apparently do not build malls without consulting this restaurant first. I used to live close to this mall so we would do our shopping and/or eat at this restaurant (maybe just get drinks).  For some reason, this place is ALWAYS crowded.  The food isn't even that great but perhaps there are no other restaurants close by...? I am not sure what road they were trying to go with the menu but they have almost every type of cuisine on there.  The Chinese chicken salad at 500 calories is quite filling and good.  The shepherd's pie was filling, savory, and enjoyable.  There was one dish that I had which was NOT good but I cannot remember (or chose to forget) what it was now. However, my favorite meal here is (surprise) the turkey club!  It is huge and has layers of deliciousness, like bacon.  The fries are also quite good and crisp.  I love clubs and this is probably one of my favorites.  The cheesecake is good - not great, but good.  The prices are expensive and a Grey Goose dirty martini can run you $12 or $14 apiece!  Also, this particular restaurant served me a Bloody Mary with a fly in caught in the celery - they comped it but gross. If you enjoy average Americanized fare and are not worried about price, this is your place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cambridge?start=240
