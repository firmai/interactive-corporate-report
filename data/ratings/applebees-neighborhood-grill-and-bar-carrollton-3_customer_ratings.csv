17,Cassandra P.,"Carrollton, GA",1,14,1.0,1.0,2013-01-02,"We went to applebee on 1/1/2013. When we received our food the steak was blue almost rare we order medium well. There was hair in our mash potatoes. we sent them back. Waited on a baked potatoes to cook, that took 5 minutes when they can to the table it was still underdone. You need to hire cooks. The vegetable melody was raw no spice, salt, pepper or butter. I wish we would have never stop at Applebees. We were never offered anything because of the hair in the food which she saw. Never saw a manger about this problem.  We left with a bill that we paid, for food that was bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also we had employees standing over the back of our booth.  While we were eating or tried too. that made us think what else did they do to the food when we sent it back.  I am 40 and my husband is 42 years old we do not need anyone watching us!!!!!!!!!!! We have never been treated this way! If they are able to come out and watch TV over your customers this is not a place for us. That made me wonder what else did they do to the food!!!! I have never gotten food that bad their. It appears they no longer care about the customer.  We will never be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
16,Chrissy S.,"Duluth, GA",6,31,3.0,3.0,2014-07-28,"The food is good, but the service can be bad. I have had the same waiter 3 times there & every time he has messed something up. Huge mess ups too. This latest time, he didn't give me my 31 cents back because ""he doesn't want to take it out of his book."" He also remarked he always does this, but if the ppl fight w/ him, he'll give them their change. This really rubbed me & my friends wrong. I didn't need that change, but its the principle of the matter. A member of my party, who is a waiter at Ruby Tuesday, remarked that he should be fired for basically tipping himself and ripping off costumers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,

12,Mandy S.,"Douglasville, GA",108,12,1.0,1.0,2015-12-14,"Today was probably my last visit. Every single time I go there, the food is cold, the wait staff is short, the kitchen is short, and it takes a really long time. I ordered a club sandwich and a soup today and I was there over 30 minutes before I got my lukewarm soup and a sandwich that looked like it had been thrown in the floor. I asked to trade my awful sandwich for a chicken fajita roll up without tomatoes because I'm allergic. That took thirty MORE minutes to get and it had tomatoes on it. Then it took 15 more minutes to get a remake. I was there for over an hour for a simple meal. The waitress was rude, took forever for a refill and ZERO apologies for what happened or a discount on my bill. Their score (that I noticed on the way OUT) was only a 90. Yuck! I will not likely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
14,Kathryn M.,"Whitesburg, GA",0,7,,1.0,2015-12-17,"This Applebees has lost our business. The service has gone downhill noticeably these last few months. They left off an item on our to-go order, blamed my son for not noticing it, and then said it was against policy to issue a refund on that item. I stayed polite - even as the girl was blaming us - until the very end when they refused to issue a refund and the manager refused to come to the phone.  Applebees - train your people! Your server told me that the receipt was confusing to read, she questioned whether 2 or 3 soups were ordered and chose 2. There were 3 rows, one for each soup, each with a different price we paid. Please train your staff that when 3 soups are paid for, 3 soups must be given.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
8,Jason B.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,5.0,2016-02-03,"Came to Carollton for work. Generally, Applebee's would be the last place I'd go. Not that I'm a snob, I just prefer to find local spots. Tonight, that really wasn't an opportunity. My co-workers; Gene, Dan, and myself came in and we're happy we did. We were immediately greeted by a hostess, and quickly found seats at the bar. The bartender...I believe her name is Tiffany, couldn't have been more awesome. Apparently it was karaoke night (another first for an Applebee's outing) but the dj was great, and introduced himself to everyone in the bar. He was great. (We're in the south, so a lot of country, but a lot of other types too. He was good.)  The bartender (Tiffany, or that's what she told me) was great. Def come back...not that it changed my opinion of Applebee's, but would come back to this particular location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
10,DORIAN S.,"Temple, GA",12,9,,1.0,2016-04-23,I'm sitting here and the manager is leaning on the bar as I've waited 30 minutes for just a drink. I wouldn't come to this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
11,Miranda W.,"Whitesburg, GA",98,14,,2.0,2016-07-18,"I wait forever for a table and finally get seated. Wait forever for the server to come. Look through the menu and literally nothing looks appetizing. I settle for a steak. Get my food and I can't even eat it cause they don't have any silverware! What kind of restaurant has no silverware!!?!? My food was cold by the time I got a fork. And guess what?! No A1 for my steak because they ""ran out"". Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
9,Chantelle C.,"Mason, OH",0,2,2.0,1.0,2016-07-31,Applebee's do not have a good variety of food and it is gross to me don't go cause it might make you have a disease and get sick a lot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
6,Auston R.,"Villa Rica, GA",3,71,312.0,4.0,2016-09-04,Came with the family for a quick meal I had the steak and black bean soup when it came out it was slightly warm but they brought me a new one witch was hot and very good just wish the steak in the soup was cooked more to a mid rare to medium than well done but other wise really good and for my meal I had the bone in pork chop with garlic string beans and pecan and maple butter mashed sweet potatoes the pork chop was pretty good but a little over cooked the string beans were watery and bland not so great but the sweet mashed potatoes were awsome and our server was great and made sure we were enjoying our meal and that every thing was right plus they had a special on Sam Adam's drat buy one get one free and a free glass witch was great and for that reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 3 not the best meal but not the worst I've ever had overall I left satisfied,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
7,Thomas C.,"Carrollton, GA",20,8,,5.0,2017-06-08,So we came in about 11:30pm on a thrusday and we were told they were literally closing the kitchen. It funny I could go to ihop at 3am and get anything at anytime... Our waiter was nice but My guest and I were pissed.. Janet was out waiter she is a fantastic caring person. And she apologized to us several times about the kitchen closing. She literally the only reason why I am giving this review 5 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
4,LeAnn B.,"Douglasville, GA",22,18,6.0,2.0,2017-07-14,"Ugh. I usually don't go to Applebee's. I haven't enjoyed their food for years. So after consistent subpar food and or service you just learn to take your business elsewhere. My family decided to do Applebee's for lunch I voiced my hesitation but decided to see if thing have gotten any better. We chose curbside to go. They had a $5 off deal which was a plus. We viewed the online menu and ordered via the internet. Only glitch was one of our lunch combo choices wasn't available online. So we had to go the more explainable route to get that dish. So that was chintzie. I drive to the store parked in the designated spot and waited. Five minutes go by. I wonder if they see me? Do they know I'm here? Am I supposed to call? So I call and inform them I am there. The server says yeah he is just done setting up or something ""I'll be right out"" he was nice I got my food fast and left. So now I am heading home... in hindsight I really should have checked each and every box but isn't that the servers job? So once I arrive at home everyone gets their meal all is well except for mine. I hit the won ton tacos and it was a fiasco!i got four won ton shells 2 were broken and a to go cup half full of this hot mess of yucky looking stuff. It didn't have a lid. No cole slaw, no fresh cilantro (as the website promotes), and no yummy sauce. I was ticked. Got in the car and drive back. In the lot I called the store and asked for the manager. He came out as did the server and they both expressed dismay at the state of my food and lack of 'service' . Whatever! The manager said he was new and was sent there to clean house. Yada, yada, yada! So long story short he relaxes my food and I go on my way. The replacement food was okay. Not great. I think I would have enjoyed frozen  egg rolls from the grocery store more. But it is what it is. Not sure if I will go back cause I wasn't pleased. My family said their food was okay but nothing spectacular so probably won't be a repeat visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
5,C L.,"Villa Rica, GA",130,52,4.0,2.0,2017-08-28,"My last visit here was not pleasant. My co workers and I always come here for after hours due to half off apps. Though its close to closing time, service there is usually good and waitresses don't rush us, nor stand by our table and make us pay right then and there. When we first got there we had to wait a bit to order. Then had to ask for silverwareand napkins. Our waitress didn't really seem to be interested in being there nor getting our order, ( I just chalked it up as being tired and wanting to get off). But what really irritated me, was her standing by our table, while we were talking and she interrupts us to pay. She grabs the little monitor on our table and basically, has us swipe our cards. It really felt rude, awkward, and irritated my table. I never had an issue with Applebee's nor any of the servers there , but this was the first. Like I stated before we ALWAYS come to Applebee's after work, but since then, my co workers and I haven't step foot in their.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
3,Ailyn B.,"Duluth, GA",39,27,21.0,4.0,2017-10-08,"Haven't gone to an Applebee's restaurant in a while but decided to because $1 margs. They weren't that great, what was great though was the food ! Loved the chicken wonton tacos it's cheaper if u get the 2 for 9.69 which our server did point out after I had order a single order of them @ $7.69. Ordered the seasonal drink, Dracula's Juice which was delicious ,only thing is that it didn't come with any of the decorative berries because they had run out. So not picture worthy. I had the cedar grilled lemon chicken, the chicken was good but the rice I did not like. Our server seemed a bit lost but he did a good job in the end. I definitely will be coming back for some more wonton tacos !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
0,Nathan S.,"Villa Rica, GA",0,40,,3.0,2017-12-11,"Had lunch there today. I had anticipated the quesadilla as it used to be really good. Disappointed...it was bland and there was no resemblance between the bland folded tortillas I got with the picture of a quesidilla in their menu.  That does it for me and Applebee's. My wife's cheeseburger was excellent, according to her. Go figure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
2,Hayley E.,"Grant Park, Atlanta, GA",17,3,,1.0,2017-12-30,"Wait staff and hosts were great. The kitchen is the problem. There was a ton of salt on the chips. Couldn't eat most of them. My Caesar salad was swimming in dressing. My potato was hard. My medium rare steak was medium well almost well done. I had to send it back, which is something I have never done before. The second one came back more done than the first one. They then wanted to try a third time. Uh, no. They compted our bill $8. The manager was unprofessional and acted like it was his first day. I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
1,Roger J.,"Woodland, AL",11,63,5.0,2.0,2018-01-10,Today re-enforced why I dislike this Applebee's so much. Went just for the Riblets special. Took over 30 minutes for the first order.  Service is terrible. Place was nearly empty and yet it took forever to get service.  Too many good restaurants in Carrollton to waste half my day in this place.  Never stain!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carrollton-3,,,,,
