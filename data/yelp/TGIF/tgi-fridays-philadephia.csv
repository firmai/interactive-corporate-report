L L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,50,40,2.0,7/20/2017,The salad was good but a few housekeeping issues. 1) how do you put a glass directly in the ice bins to pick up the ice. Don't you know the glass can break.   2) you should not get soda from the fountain with your personal water bottles  3) and you should not drink soda at the fountain,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia

Lindsey D.,"Saint Paul, MN",101,12,3,1.0,8/21/2017,"We very often have coupons for Fridays and sometimes a free sandwich just seems more appealing than turning on the stove in an 80 degree apartment.  The vibe on a Thursday at 6:15 was weird to say the least. There was a DJ playing LOUD music inside and the two of us were seated at a giant booth nearby.  I got the southwest chicken salad. It was fine, but I think I could've made a better one at home. The service was slow and the music was too loud to carry on a conversation (wow, I really am getting old).  All-in-all, I was thoroughly unimpressed. We had attempted to go to this location once before to sit outside on the roof deck for some drinks and were told the roof deck was closed (at 7 PM on a Saturday) so we went elsewhere.

Monique M.,"Bucks County, PA",11,2,,1.0,8/20/2017,"This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but not anymore. We came into the restaurant and perhaps because we were sat by the window, a server didn't appear to our table for a half hour and that was after we inquired as to whether or not we even had a server. Once the server came, she was friendly and apologetic, we gave our food and drink orders. It took another half hour to get our drinks (refillable tea, which was never refilled) and another fifteen minutes after that for us to receive our food. Once we did it was hot and tasted pretty good. My son ordered endless appetizers, but had to wait about 20 minutes for each order to be filled. After the second refill, he was annoyed, as were we all and we found someone to give us the bill, paid it and left.

Leanna C.,"Denver, CO",70,266,43,2.0,12/21/2017,It's just what you would expect from a TGI Friday's. It's over priced and the service is sub par.

Des C.,"Barrington, RI",94,268,18,1.0,8/5/2017,"What a joke this place is!  Since we were still in a bit of a late lunch cheesesteak coma we decided to have a light dinner at the hotel restaurant.  We arrived and were told that there was a 15 minute wait....even though there were a number of open tables.  They said that those tables were for 21 and over people, and we had our 8 year old twins with us.  Okay, I guess I cannot argue with that, so we waited. 15 minutes or so later they called our name and put us in the booth at the other end of the joint.  We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to greet us or even take a drink order.  Finally I decided that we would take our business elsewhere but wanted to let a manager know.  When we were walking our we asked to have a manager come.  After 5 minutes of waiting we started walking out when a man appeared from the upstairs.  He asked what the issue was, so I told him that we had waited without even being acknowledged.  He said that he would be happy to discount our order if we stayed.  I told him that I was not interested in that after the experience I had and would be letting corporate know.  He said ""Thank you"" as we walked away. This place should be shut down or switched to another chain.  Don't waste your money or time here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia
Jade B.,"Philadelphia, PA",197,77,9,2.0,6/24/2017,I spent a bit at the rooftop bar and enjoyed the concept. The drink I received was strong however the cup wasn't filled all the way up. The music was also way too loud for there not being a lot of people there it was weird. The food was as expected everyone enjoyed with little complaints. We did tell the server it was my birthday and he seemed to forget. When he did remember he congratulated my brother. The busser dragged two high chairs loudly across the room. Along with complaining about his job while cleaning the table next to us. Overall. I wouldn't go back or recommend unless you were just going to the rooftop.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia
Stephanie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",286,157,203,4.0,5/22/2017,"Honestly contrary to popular belief, TGI Fridays on the Parkway gets hella lit.  I work on 16th and Arch and the rooftop in the summer time is the place to be for Friday night happy hour at our company.  Their specials are amazing and the view of the city from the patio is unbeatable. The bartenders on the patio are so nice and make the $5 long island iced teas v strong.  They also have $5 select appetizers on special as well.   We came with a huge party of 25 on Friday paying with American Express company gift cards and they were so accommodating.  They even set the patio up earlier than 5 pm for our party...shout out to Stacey and Stephanie!

Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,46,22,3.0,10/14/2017,"I'm staying at the Sheraton down the block and I was hungry so I went there around 10 pm on Friday. The restaurant seemed more like a night club as in you go there to pre game before you go out. It was extremely small, a dj was playing old school music which i loved and the service wasn't all that bad. It had a very free spirit vibe and though I do like that, there were young girls nearly naked there. Problem is, there were young children there as well. If they want to turn it into a club then make it 21 yrs or older after a certain time. I don't even think the girls half dressed were 21. It made me uncomfortable. Food came out pretty quick.

Tim H.,"Jersey City, NJ",67,11,5,1.0,7/3/2017,"One of the worst experiences I have gone through. I do NOT Recommend this place to anyone.  First off the staff has no coordination.  They told me and my wife we were placed 2nd on some ""list""  They then went on to let others ahead of us.  Once I asked the server why we weren't placed in our table because we were 2nd. She goes to say the table we had ready for us was unavailable  due to the server NOT wanting to work. I'm sorry. It's your job.  She then went on to say we were in the wrong and had to wait even more after letting others ahead of us. Instead of offering us an apology she kept debaiting she was inthe right and asked us to wait even longer with a nasty attitude. I didn't realize costumer service wasn't a priority.  How are we placed 2nd but get pushed back to dead last after waiting for over 40 + min.  This is ridiculous.  Stay away from this place.  And to management.

They were ok, and so were the fried pickles. I got the meatballs which were overly salty. It was filling too. The potato skins were way too dry. I don't recommend those at all.

Marissa W.,"West Chester, PA",80,11,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Worst dining experience of my life. Got seated at around 8, everyone got drinks around 8:45 (we ordered waters and 1 tea), then everyone eventually got food around 9:30. I think we saw our waitress 3 times in the total 3 hours we were there when we were her only table. Most of us ordered Endless Apps and waited so long to get them that our server eventually decided to just ring in random items and bring them to our table when they got out. Even when we got all of those items, still everyone didn't have food. Our waitress tried to blame everyone else for the delay and even argued with as after asking if we got everything and we informed her that we didn't. When I eventually got my food after an hour and a half of waiting, I asked for blue cheese for my wings. Sharday (our waitress) never returned. Meanwhile there were about five servers sitting at a booth nearby for our entire dinner and no one ever came to check in on us. Sharday was taking over an hour now to get back to the table and it was almost 11pm, we wanted to dine and dash it was so long. I'm sure the other servers heard us talking about it, by this point we were pretty much the only table in the place. No one came over. Eventually, one of us had to go over to the group of servers and ask for our checks. They all started asking ""Yeah where IS Sharday??"" as if they hadn't noticed she'd been gone for over an hour. Finally she came with our checks and after 20 minutes of ringing up our checks, we finally got out of that horrible establishment.

We asked for the Endless Apps offer, but were told that we were too late as it ends at 11!

Like ok but why didn't she bring our food? She's like oh you guys could have told me. Umm we weren't aware that she was in training and you were our actual waitress like what type of stuff is that? They should let ppl know someone is in training and then they shouldn't mid way through ordering leave and another waitress take over without our knowledge it was very confusing. I also didn't appreciate that there is hardly any vegetarian or Pescetarian type foods. I wanted sizzling salmon and shrimp and they said they couldn't substitute it. I mean the salmon meals were $20 alone and sizzling chicken and shrimp was $17 idk why salmon with shrimp was $26. That's a total rip off.

Giancarlo M.,"Philadelphia, PA",160,3,1,1.0,6/4/2016,"DO NOT EVER COME HERE - I just had the worst service of my life. I could understand if the place was mobbed with rowdy customers during a sporting event they were playing and the service was lacking. That was not the case tonight. There were open tables, drinks took forever to get to the table and when they did - they had to be the WORST drinks I ever had. How ironic that this establishment markets ""THEE Friday's Ultimate Margarita"" and it was the worst drink I have ever had made for me outside of my undergrad days drinking mystery drinks during my collegiate rugby years. I chugged beer out of my mate's rugby cleat and this was still worse. I came here because my daughter is a picky eater and it was late, and for some reason she loves Fridays. The waiter did not bring waters for ANY of us. We ordered wings and asked for plates so we could share. Never came. He passed by twice and we politely reminded him - still nothing. It just kept getting worse from that point on and I could drone on forever about how much worse it got but I'll sum it up. Even the server said sorry but had no reason or excuse for his shitty service. Feeling sorry is nice and all but it doesn't excuse you for sucking at your job. On top of that, there were about 4 uniformed people who worked there walking up and down the aisle as if they were checking up on things but didn't do anything. Definitely not short staffed, just lazy. I am in the Army and I know what shamming out looks like. This place wreaked of it. I can't believe I even paid for my sorry excuse for a meal.  Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE ELSE. Hopefully it will go out of business and become a parking lot...or even abandoned lot - it would be a better use of space. An ABANDONED LOT would be a better use of space. Yours truly, Giancarlo",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=40
Arda A.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,18,10,1.0,2/9/2017,"Read most of the bad reviews before going in but thought we'd give it a shot because I was craving Friday's veggie burger! The place did not smell good and we asked for a seat near the windows. There were two empty tables by the windows but the server said we can't use those 'coz 'the waiter who serves that table was having the day off!' (Hmm!) So she took us upstairs - which was entirely empty. While she was walking us up and down, she was talking into her mic and headset asking about seats (as if we are at a large hall with thousands of people that she needed the mic and headset throughout that journey!) She even said we can only use a particular table upstairs, so we said we'd rather sit downstairs. Back downstairs. There was a couple that was leaving their table and we asked her if we could use that one. She said ok but that we'd have to wait 15 minutes for them to ""prepare the table"" (hmm) so we thought ok maybe we can wait. We were looking at the TV while waiting - there was a political show on and we thought we might as well wait standing if it's going to take 15 minutes for them to clean the table, but the waiter came back and said we would have to wait in the lobby area outside and that we ""cannot wait while standing."" That was it. We went out without even telling them we were leaving. But who knows, maybe they are still cleaning that table or waiting for that table's waiter to come back from vacation. Worst service for a place that leans toward being pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=40
Mandee F.,"Raynham, MA",142,51,2,1.0,7/5/2015,"Our experience at this location on July 3rd was hands down the poorest service and experience we'd ever had at any TGI Friday's.  We should've had an idea of what was to come immediately upon entering the door. We followed 2 other parties in, and the hostess had a terrible time explaining that we couldn't head right upstairs to the roof patio but rather had to wait for each party to be seated individually downstairs. The wait wasn't an issue when it came to getting seated, but it was a very discombobulated situation in terms of understanding what we needed to do (which was wait downstairs and then be retrieved by the hostess per group as she went up and down the stairs).  Once we were seated, no one came to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were parched and in pretty bad need of water. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes...we finally grabbed a random waitress walking by and asked for service. She went and found us someone inside who said that apparently the other server had left and no one had replaced her at her tables (great).  So, we put in our drink orders and ordered our food at the same time. Another 30 minutes passed. NO DRINKS, NO FOOD OR APPS. We grabbed the other server again as she walked by who seemed appalled that we STILL hadn't gotten our drinks. (Note: the roof patio wasn't even busy - only maybe 2 or 3 other parties were out there.) Over an hour of waiting later, the drinks finally showed up, but we never did get the pitcher of water that we asked for when placing our order. Our alcoholic beverages didn't come until even later. But we had our water - FINALLY - after asking for it numerous times.  Onto the food...our boneless wings were NOT boneless. I personally ate a wing and felt a huge crunch, spitting out a mouthful with a 1 in (maybe bigger) piece of bone. Yuck. There was also a long piece of hair on that plate that I pulled out and tossed onto the ground.    My husband ordered Jack Daniels flat iron steak and got the steak with no Jack Daniels sauce. He sat around waiting for the sauce (which was supposed to be ON the steak to begin with) for about 10 minutes. It was clear our server was frustrated with the kitchen because our food was taking so incredibly long and coming out incorrect.  We did tell her to inform the kitchen of some of these issues, but we didn't get approached by management or have any adjustments to our bill. We didn't ask directly to speak with management but given all of the problems we were dealing with and alerting them of, you would think management would've been informed.  Our take away from this experience? Next time we'll ask for a manager...and next time, we won't be choosing TGI Friday's for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=40

I had a coupon for a free appetizer, so I had the mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, which were really good. For my lunch, I had a Jack Daniel's burger with french fries.

I asked the employee who sat customers were there any tables by the window which looks out onto the Parkway. She said, ""No...we only have one."" Thought that was EXTREMELY weird; we only needed one table. THAT should have been the sign for us to leave. She sat us at the one table by the window. Good.  I ordered a cocktail, my guest ordered water. Waitress returns with water for both of us - no cocktail. We sat 30 minutes no food, no cocktail. She did stop by and told me the bartender was working on my drink. Fifteen minutes later she came with drink but glass was dirty. I asked her to cancel the drink. Guest got his food after waiting nearly an hour - I waited a little longer. When she did bring my dish it was the wrong item.  In the many years I've eaten out, I have NEVER experience this type of inadequacy. I can laugh now as I think about the buffoonery of it all. Why didn't we pick up and leave?

They were not terribly busy, but the long wait to get in on a Wednesday night was due to the fact they just don't pay attention to the patrons.   We were told our wait would be 20 minutes but it was well over 30 minutes.  We waited, like everybody else has mentioned, longer than necessary to get our water we requested.  It was another interminable wait for our waitress to come back to take our order.  Of the four orders, two were correct.  We ate it anyway and I made a mental note to make sure our bill reflected the food we were served and not the food we ordered.   While we were waiting for our food, a patron was leaving the restaurant but was unable to navigate the stairs to get back to street level.  There is a wheelchair lift she planned to use.  One employee locked her in it and left her.  I'm not sure why she left, but that poor woman was left there for 15 minutes.  Not only did I feel sorry for her having to stand for that long when it was clear she was uncomfortable but how humiliating!   Our waitress knew a group of people who came in while we were eating.  If I thought we were ignored before, I am not sure how to describe how ignored we were after her friends came in.  She took my credit card for the bill and walked over to visit with them.  It was 10 minutes of visiting before she left them to run my card.  In that time, I was trying to pool enough cash at the table so I could leave that and walk over to her to ask for my card back.  Sadly, we were short $6. On top of the horrible service and mediocre food, the music was unbearably loud.  We were not seated at the bar, either.

We both got the 2 for $12 deal.  Green Bean Fries  These were nicely fried and the green beans actually weren't mush. The horseradish sauce was nice.  Spinach Florentine Flatbread These were dreadful. Limp, moist, no texture at all. Almost bland. Chicken Fingers These came well fried and were huge and plentiful. The accompanying fries were seasoned with S/P and were decent. Cheeseburger At a joint like this - they won't be asking for the temp of your burger. Expect it cooked well. Still - they create a nice char. Two slices of American cheese. Decent - but nothing to write home about. Fries were OK.  Overall - a filling meal and affordable. But nothing great.

We arrived at 4:00 and went up to the rooftop bar. Who knew they had a rooftop bar?! Happy hour specials don't start until 5:00 but the bartender said let's just start it at 4:00, who cares. I like this guy. More and more people from work began filing in but there was plenty of room and the bartenders helped us pull tables together. The reggae playing over the speakers had everyone feeling irie and as time went on I looked around and everyone was having a fantastic time.

luke B.,"Denver, CO",0,20,,1.0,4/30/2014,"Alright... so let me preface this review by the fact that I have given this place multiple attempts, as I often stay at the Embassy Suites above it for business and this place doubles as a hotel restaurant as well as a standalone place. This means it is the only place I had access to without going outside, so I've probably visited here about 5 times.  The food is what it is - it is a chain, the food comes in pre-packaged, its pretty hard to have a variable experience with regards to the food at a TGI Friday's. What earns it the one star is everything else about the experience. As others have mentioned, the service is terrible, particularly at the bar. The bartenders (I think one is the manager) is more concerned with making wildly inappropriate comments to some ""regulars"" than serving anyone else (I'm a young dude, I usually don't get bothered by this stuff, but I've sat there being ignored for 10 minutes due to this banter). The beers are outrageously overpriced... though some happy hour specials are fantastic.  The nail in the coffin is the cleanliness... the last time i visited there, I had a shopping bag on the ground next to me at the bar, and the guy next to me was kind enough to point out that a cockroach was about to crawl in it.

The main problem is that they are a franchise, so they do things a little bit different. What completely turned me off, was that they had a DJ next to the bar! WTF! I couldn't hear my self think. If I wanted to hear a DJ, I would have gone to old city or a real happy hour.  I had to move upstairs, which was empty, but I just waited 20 mins.  They didn't even have the TV's on. I am sitting watching Music Choice pics.  Service is ok, depending on who serves you.  City Line's Fridays is no better.  So basically, if you want a typical Fridays experience, forget about it.  Forget about it in Philly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Van C.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,29,8,2.0,12/9/2009,Some of the worst waitstaff I've ever experienced in this place out of all the numerous times I've eaten here. The food is sub par and the service is often ruff around the edges. If your looking for a good meal and a nice time eat somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Amy B.,"Seattle, WA",27,67,8,4.0,12/2/2009,"Okay, I know it's chain and maybe that doesn't make it ""cool."" So it's not a secret yet to be discovered. It's right on the very beaten path. But, the food is consistent and their drink menu is so darn fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Nora S.,"Boston, MA",20,75,,2.0,7/16/2009,"It is what it is. Just fine, but absolutely nothing great. I wish that they would better utilize that awesome roof deck they have with a view of the parkway and city hall. But they don't. We showed up at 9pm on a Sunday and they were no longer seating people out there. And it's really the only reason we went in the first place. So sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Chris T.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,46,1,3.0,9/7/2009,"In the pile of calories served to me I found a few surprises: unexpected ham, rubber advocado, and a jar of mayo. So if that's your thing. Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Rob A.,"Downingtown, PA",0,3,,1.0,6/23/2014,"We recently went here for a work happy hour.  What a joke this place is.  First we got yelled at by the staff because happy hour doesn't start on the roof deck until 5pm.  Ok whatever, but your menu says happy hour from 4-7 pm.  So, um that makes no sense.  Next, happy hour drink specials are very limited.  2.75 for bud, that's the only beer special.  We paid 5.75 for a miller lite bottle and 6.50 for red's apple ale bottle.  This during happy hour?  All the other bars along the parkway offer specials on beer for happy hour.  This fridays has to go, it's so gross walking through it, very dirty.  The only reason they are still in business is because of the roof deck and proximity to hotels.  There are much better places to go in the city for outdoor summer happy hour with much better drink specials.  TGI Fridays on the parkway is such a rip off. Avoid this place if you are in the city for business, pleasure or whatever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Tia L.,"Philadelphia, PA",17,106,4,1.0,5/24/2009,"The Philly restaurants have spoiled me with good service and food, so when my friend said she wanted to meet here, I winced.  I figured I would give it a chance... but I should have gone with my gut.  The service was just terrible... there was practically no one there and our waiter was nowhere to be seen when we needed or ever asked for something.  I waited almost 15 minutes for the Jack Daniel sauce for my Jack Daniel Burger. And then my burger was burnt! Just avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Tim I.,"Philadelphia, PA",96,4,,2.0,2/15/2013,"the service was suck we asking  individual bill the server just put in one bill the server never come to my table to take dirty plate and asking is it everything ok they just busy with superball,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Stef H.,"Morongo Valley, CA",12,90,,1.0,1/15/2010,"I would never go back here again. A couple of years ago after an average breakfast, I slipped and falled on some wet stairs within their establishment.  I ended up in the ER of a local hospital.  When I complained to the Manager later, they blew me off and said something had been done about it.  Like what?  They had put up some yellow cones but their roof still had a leak  and was dripping water. Verdict?  Forget about T.G.I. Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Aaron L.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2010,"INFESTED WITH COCKROACHES. Scene:  I'm sitting at the bar. Just ordered the 3 course meal deal, enjoying a beer. The place is fairly busy. The bartender walks away after taking my order. THen from behind the counter crawls a brownish red cockroach the size of jumbo pack of Juicyfruit. At first I am startled (I HATE BUGS) and then it crawls right up to me. I immediately throw my drink down, grab my jacket and get the bartender's attention. I inform her that i will not be dining here tonight and that i am going to be sick. She inquires why, and i reveal the fetid creature under my glass and say ""I can't tolerate this'.  She seems unsurprised by the bug's presence and says ""okay"", as if it were a common thing to happen here.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. ZERO STARS. THIS PLACE IS FUCKING DISGUSTING.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Ryan P.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,12,,1.0,9/14/2011,"I also agree with Misha.  This place is HOOD.  The sizzling Chicken was delicious though.  There are too many good places to eat in Philadelphia, do not consider going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Michelle F.,"Cheverly, MD",14,50,26,1.0,2/1/2010,Terrible!  This Friday's was attached to my hotel.  After a show at the Spectrum a friend and I were hoping to catch a bite.  It was around 12:40am   They close at 1am.   The door was already locked.  WTF???? Why close so early on a Friday night?  The hotel was packed due to the Phillies hosting the World Series and Pearl Jam playing the Spectrum and a lot of people were trying to get inside.... Oh well its their lostt revenue :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Michael D.,"Elmer, NJ",158,34,,5.0,7/7/2009,The food was good and the service was great we only waited 30 min for our table which was good considering it was the 4th of July and the restaurant was in the center of all the 4th events.  My bf and i sat down got drinks ordered and ate and paid all in 45 min that's my kind of service.  Also anyone who likes Fridays i definitely suggest getting the strips card i have had it for a couple months and i have already gotten 3 coupons for a buy 1 get 1 free dinner and a free app coupon when i signed up so its definitely and a great place to go for great for at great prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Roger K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,,1.0,8/1/2009,"The service was horrible. The food was okay, not sure if it was worth more than half of what I paid for though. The server delivered my sandwich without all the stuff it is supposed to come with.  My drink was empty when I got my food and I had to wait 15 minutes before I saw her again to ask for a refill (again) and get everything I was supposed to get with the sandwich. By that time though the bread was all soggy and my food was just cold and greasy. On top of that, it didn't really seem like she was busy. It just seemed like she didn't care enought to even try and give decent service. I guess she doesn't know her income is dependent on providing decent service.  I've worked in several restaurants before and know what you are supposed to do.  1. You check the food to make sure it is what they ordered before you serve it. 2. You check back with the customer 3 minutes after you serve the food to make sure they have everything  and are happy. 3. You make sure they have something to drink when you serve the food or soon after. 4. You don't disappear for 15 minute chunks of time. Try to keep it to 5 and ask for help if you get too busy to do any of the above in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
Yvonne Y.,"San Francisco, CA",66,174,2,2.0,11/26/2005,The only reason this place gets any stars is because it was the only place open at 11pm. EVERYTHING closes so frickin' early in this town. The server was so cool. we loved him...a fellow student.  He is also the reason this place got any stars.  The food was terrible. If you want a real money maker in philly- open a late night pizza joint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadephia?start=120
