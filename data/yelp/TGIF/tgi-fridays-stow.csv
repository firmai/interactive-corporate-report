Glenn H.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",7,1,,2.0,11/6/2015,The food here was so gross. All of our 6 meals came out at different times and all cold. Waitress was apologetic and kind but to be honest this place has really and truly gone to the dogs. Won't be back any time soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Jessica M.,"Chicago, IL",178,8,39,1.0,4/5/2014,"Wow. Ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp platter. The plate was not sizzling. And the chicken was not cooked! Asked for a replacement and it looks like they quickly slapped a plate together. Second plate was again not sizzling. Cheese was not melted, could totally see the straight edges of the cheese. And apparently just your basic single sliced American cheese (see photos). I know its TGIF and nothing fancy, but really!? One star for at least making sure the chicken was cooked this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Tammie E.,"Streetsboro, OH",9,58,10,2.0,3/18/2014,"I've been to Fridays from here to Maine and in most states down to Florida. Weirdly enough, they are NOT the same experience, as most chains are. This one was one of those times. The worst Fridays we've eaten in is in Westchase, just north of Tampa. This will be the second worst, and it's unfortunate, because I really do like getting the deals on my Stripes card.  The food wasn't bad. Well, the paid for food, anyway. The chips that come with the Stripes card were cold, wet (soggy from cold oil), and unsalted. The salsa was fairly bland, too. I had a 6oz steak with lobster bites. The husband had a free Stripes meal of ribs.  I had the steak fries with parmesan for the first time and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were tasty, and I enjoyed the sauce that came with the lobster bites. The husband ate all his ribs and most of his fries, so I'm assuming he enjoyed his, too. He was just very put out by the wet chips. Our biggest complaint was the server. She acted like we were the biggest pains in the you know what all because I asked her about the coupon I had brought to use, and if she needed my phone number to add my new points to my Stripes card, being that I don't have an actual card to give them. I'm sure they get stiffed on tips by people who don't account for the discounted meal, but for the attitude she had, we should have just stiffed her for that alone! Maybe we'll try another one in the area, or, if worse comes to worse, just go back to Youngstown and eat at that one there with the family.  (P.S. We did tip her based on what the actual cost of food was, not the discounted amount, but she certainly didn't deserve it!!!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Anonymous B.,"Kent, OH",0,61,,2.0,10/5/2014,"Gave two stars because the service was pretty good. Otherwise, skip it.  I thought Friday's was trying to compete with other chains. With the prices we saw, it just isn't happening.  Ordered Jack Daniel's chicken & shrimp. The breast is what a lot of places are doing, cutting a full one in half thereby doubling their profits on every single breast. It was TINY. Five bites at best. Don't care to ever go back to a Friday's now, though the server I had was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Randi B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",216,1184,1903,2.0,6/4/2010,"Came here our first night in Ohio cause we were in a hurry and it was next to the hotel. This place was dead at 8:30 at night. All the servers were sitting in a booth hanging out. Our waiter was over quickly. We ordered 2 salads and a bowl of soup. Should be quick right? Toss some lettuce around, pour some soup in a bowl. Plus, there were maybe 5 other people in the restaurant. No, we waited 30 minutes for the food! When the waiter brought it, my dad told him we were in a hurry, so bring the check now.  By the time we paid and left it was 9:30. The food was fine, it was soup and salad, can't really eff that up. But the service was ridiculous!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Mike N.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",58,629,2,2.0,8/2/2012,"It has been a while since I've been to Fridays and it will be a while till I come back. The menu sounds better than it is. Everything seems way over seasoned. Maybe it's to encourage drink orders. Look at their website. Most entrees contain more than the daily recommendation for Sodium content, sometimes nearly twice. Not healthy. At this location the food seemed anything but fresh. Food came out slow, but our server was attentive. Portion size was small for the price.   Selection of beer was no better than my local grocery store.  This chain tries to look like a neighborhood bar and grill. I guess I am lucky to live by neighborhood establishments that do a far better job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20
Binion S.,"Canton, OH",0,23,43,3.0,3/4/2012,"We have eaten at this TGIF several times in the dining room. Most dine-in experiences are uneventful but an overall positive experience - consistent food, fair price, good service. I just don't understand why that doesn't translate to the takeout area. On several independent occasions an order for a pair of salads come out just wrong enough to really annoy me. Twice they forgot to include extra dressing, once no dressing at all, once the wrong salad, and this week no chicken on the Caribbean Chicken salad. I like their salads but a little more focus from the salad makers would be much appreciated.  Word of advice...check your togo orders before leaving - don't be in such a hurry to get home or you'll find yourself frustrated in your kitchen with a chicken-less chicken salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow?start=20

Candi K.,"Allentown, PA",290,709,53,4.0,7/1/2014,"I normally try to avoid chains when I travel, but when I arrived at my hotel and saw that it was going to rain in the next hour, the last thing I wanted to do was get drenched and then have to drive my car forever.  So down to the TGI Fridays I went. I was actually a wee bit impressed.  I've occasionally had a quick lunch or a happy hour here, and this was my first visit since the upgraded menu.  Prices are up a bit, but the food was good & the service was spot on.  I did eat pretty early (around 5:30) before the crowds came in, but my server kept good tabs on me during my entire visit (the manager stopped by, too).  Nothing worse than eating alone and then waiting forever alone for something you need.  I had the new berry mojito (not amazing, but not shabby) and the California Club with fries and a side of ranch.  The fries were piping hot and the sandwich was monstrous (it made a nice late night snack).  A little more avocado would have been nice (just two tiny slices), but for sub $10 for a sandwich, I'm not sure it's worth a complaint. The chances that I make it back to this location are pretty low, and this is definitely not the ""best food ever"" recommendation for the area, but for a quick, quiet dinner after a long day on the road, it's not a bad choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
Justin L.,"Cleveland, OH",8,209,21,1.0,11/13/2017,I stopped by on Monday last week for lunch before my appointment I had the southern fried chicken sandwich and my driver had the turkey avocado BLT we both had seasonal fries.  The southern fried chicken sandwich and seasonal fries were cold the sandwich was burnt did not look like it was cooked. I even had to send it back to the kitchen with no lunch  The turkey avocado blt was ok not what you expected everything was store bought like I could make it at home.  My driver was the only person that got food. I have contacted the manager to advise them what happen they failed to do anything or make this right. I won't return to this Friday location or any T.G.I.

Amy K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",311,451,1710,4.0,2/25/2017,"Stopped here while on a business trip after landing in Akron around 3pm on a Monday. The restaurant was rather quiet and we were seated quickly. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I was traveling with a friend who is allergic to onions so she normally has a hard time finding a menu item that she can enjoy. Our waitress triple checked her requests to make sure she could eat what she ordered without risk. I had the Sizzling Chicken and Spinach which was on the 'light menu'. It was really tasty! Plenty of food, fresh mushrooms and a tomato/mozzarella side. The restaurant was very clean and everything was as expected. A nice stop off of the highway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
Holly L.,"Stow, OH",39,153,220,2.0,7/4/2017,Very slow service and two errors in our orders - not really surprised but was hoping for better. Food was hot and the summer all day happy hour drink prices were good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
Missy G.,"Hudson, OH",4,93,21,2.0,12/1/2016,"Where to begin. It was a Thursday night at 6:30 PM.  The parking lot was filled. Normally, I would call that a good sign. But in this case, not. I ordered the Fish Sandwich. I was picturing a breaded fish on soft bun. However, the Fish was dried out Mahi, rolled into small balls, placed in a pita-like bread and absolutely smothered with Balsamic Vinegar and raw garlic and onions. There were mushrooms and field greens thrown in with a yogurt sauce.  This might have been the worst sandwich I have ever tasted. The balsamic was so thick it overpowered everything else. I promptly ate it like a salad and pushed my bread to the side, as it was impossible to eat. The Waitress was kind, but very hurried. She stopped at the table, but took flight as she asked for an answer to: ""You guys ok?"" He ordered a Chicken Club, which was "" nothing special."" The iced tea was served absolutely warm. If only the restaurant employees remembered the phrase: ""the devil is in the details. "" Apparently, the tea was just made and no one took the time to stir the ice into the glass. The entire meal should have been sent back. However, with a Server that is too rushed and not focused, the meal remained on the table. The meal was awful and the service, reckless. The bill was $27.00. I really wish we had gone to Olive Garden instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
Brandi G.,"Goshen, IN",0,41,8,2.0,11/5/2016,"This is the least favorite restaurant I've been to in awhile, the food  was cold and not cooked correctly. Also this place is way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you get.  Would have preferred to have went to the Texas roadhouse next-door, but they close to early. So we resorted to come here, big mistake of the night.   TGIF is nothing special and way over priced!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
John H.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Went to Friday's on a Saturday night, second choice because Texas Roadhouse next door had an hour wait.

Cindy A.,"North Canton, OH",0,4,,1.0,1/13/2017,"I am sure you run these promotions (Buy one entrée get one free ) to get people to come to your restaurant....and it worked,  my friend and I went for lunch today.  We were going to order the pick two lunch but our server said coupon not good for that, so we both ordered a larger more expensive lunch with drinks. Lunch was very good that was not the issue and the server was very nice. Went to pay for our lunch with one my $10 rewards gift cards for buying $100 worth of gift cards before Christmas. Server said you can't use a $10 gift card to pay for your lunch and a coupon. I'm sorry I thought gift cards could be used as cash obviously I will NOT be purchasing any more gift cards from you. It is really sad because you send coupons all the time and we go out to lunch everyday.  The waitress did not even ask for my rewards number to credit today's lunch.

Tracy F.,"Akron, OH",12,81,51,2.0,3/5/2016,"Ewe. I guess I just need to come to terms with I'm just not rich enough to afford good food that won't make me sick.  That or I just need to stay far away from anytg fried. Probably actually a little of both.  Went tonite for the 2nd time of my life.  I got the grean bean things and the pretzels. Not worth the money. I know they are trying this new ""gimmick"" $4 & $7 thing.....but it's just not worth it. If I had to guess, they probably pay about  $35 ish dollars for an entire case of the pretzels....so their money is made after about 7 or so orders.  At 2 pretzels per order. ....which is very chinzy in my opinion... this place is just very cheap... They need to clean their menus also. Gross@!! So, the waiter was allright. Obviously he's wasn't going to make a big tip on our table with alcohol sales and dinners....and it showed.   But back to the food.  Yuk. I got sick again. It's almost 5 am the same night--- been on the pot twice allredy. (Sorry for TMI).... Like I said, I'm just not rich enough to afford the palette I have.  I've just gotta stop giving these chains my money.  When will I ever learn?? Well one thing is for sure, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow

The California Chicken Club sandwich ($10.20), however was not good, as the chicken tasted like it wasn't fully cooked, although the rest of the sandwich ingredients were fantastic...toasted baguette with hickory-smoked bacon, smoked Gouda cheese, chopped romaine, tomato, avocado and yogurt aioli...so that part is what I ate instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
Chris S.,"Akron, OH",14,5,,2.0,2/3/2017,"Pretty disappointed this time. I ordered for curbside pickup, and it was like pulling teeth to just get someone to take my order as the phone kept ringing and then I had to be transferred. I then arrived a few minutes early and had to sit outside for over 15 minutes before I decided to just get out of my car and go in. There were absolutely no employees watching to see if anyone was waiting. When I went inside, I found my meal had been sitting on the bar for who knows how long. It had to have been awhile because my food was only lukewarm. The onions and peppers on my sizzling chicken seemed old also, and smelled overly strong. Employee who gave me my food seemed bothered by my presence. Overall not a good experience. The last few times I've ordered from here, the food was excellent and the employees were very nice, so I'm not sure what happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow

Susan C.,"Stow, OH",4,221,83,2.0,10/29/2013,"You know what? In all my 58 years, I've never made or received a phone call that included the words ""want to go eat at TGI Fridays?"". Never ever. That's odd, don't you think? I haven't been to a TGIF in years. I looked at their menu online today, just wanting something different for a change. I spotted their Skillet Garlic Shrimp, described as ""risotto-style rice topped with tender garlic-marinated shrimp, roasted garlic and a bruschetta mix of diced tomatoes and fresh basil in a creamy roasted Alfredo sauce"".  So, I hopped in my car and drove the 4 miles for lunch. Two moms and their babies entered just before me, and all of us stood at the hostess desk and waited, waited, waited. The moms finally went up to the bar to tell them no one was around. Eventually a young lady scurried over and told the moms to wait while she set up a table with two high chairs, and eventually a young man walked over and took me to a table.  Then I had to wait, wait, wait for a server. Mind you, this was at about 1:15 pm, very few customers left from lunch. Also, there was a very stern looking woman standing in the main aisle, complete with clipboard, iPad, arms crossed, watching the few customers like she expected them to steal the silverware. Every now and then she took off at top speed, invariably returning to her post. She had that harsh elementary school principal mien about her that would make kindergarten kids wet their pants for breathing wrong.  The young man finally took my order, about 15 minutes after walking through the front door. The Skillet Garlic Shrimp was $12.99. It included more whole, un-cut cloves of garlic than shrimp. The flavors were very strong, which left my lips a little numb from the spices, not at all expected by the menu description. What really bothered me is there was NOTHING that came with the meal. No garlic toast, no salad, not so much as a single oyster cracker. The dish was prepared with ingredients that left the skillet just standing in oil. It is not a dish I would want a second time. As the young man brought the check, the intrusive hovering woman appeared at my tableside with her clipboard and iPad. She introduced herself (you have to picture her demeanor and tone as if she were the person who trained military personnel to waterboard terrorist suspects) as a representative from Pat Henry Research Group. They were conducting research and had a survey that I could either fill out on a piece of paper or on an iPad. In return for my time, I would get a gift card for a free appetizer up to an $8 value to use for my next visit. Well, it's been several years since I've been at this restaurant, and I have no plans to return any time soon, so I declined. I'm not sure what to make of this visit. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. I thought the meal was overpriced for lunch (the price isn't on the website). I spent $16.58 for the meal and a Coke, paid with a $20 bill, and got 4 dollar bills for change. I guess the guy I assumed I would pay him back in his tip? No interest in returning. I'm surprised this place is very busy, especially next door to the far superior Texas Roadhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stow
