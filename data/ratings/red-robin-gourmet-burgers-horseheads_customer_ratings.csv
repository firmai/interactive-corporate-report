17,Michael A.,"Horseheads, NY",25,12,6.0,1.0,2014-09-28,"First the good stuff: - Brand new so everything was clean, and surprisingly efficient.   - We were quoted a 45 minute wait, but were seated in less than 30 - Food was very good. Based on the food quality I would have rated higher, but we had a few issues: - The 'endless fries' meant 1 serving, as our waitress never returned and didn't ask when she DID. - The 'endless fruit cup' ... same, but in this case I hailed her down and asked, and it took nearly 20 minutes. - In fact, we were still waiting for the fruit cup and the server was asking if we wanted dessert ... um, no, fruit cup.  And I mentioned the fries at that point, but my wife was done so we got nothing. - No soda refills. BUT ... the worst thing was that after reviewing my bank account I had to chase down an 'error' in what we were charged at the bar. While we waited we got a wine and a beer, and settled up immediately.  The total was just over $12, and I tipped up to $14.  The bank charge was for more than $21!   When I spoke to a manager he looked into it and pulled the original slip and the entry sheet.  My figures were clear and complete - $14 as the total.  BUT ... the entry was for more than $21, with the server giving herself a $9 tip!   Having someone steal from you on your first visit to an establishment is really NOT a good start.  I hate to say that I hope it cost the person their job, but it is unlikely I am the only one she stole from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116
18,David C.,"Horseheads, NY",2,2,,4.0,2014-09-29,"I suspected this when observing the construction of the new building, and my suspicion was confirmed during our first visit... this place is small. Only 17-20 tables/booths in the dining room, with a few more in the bar area. Got a table for 4 of us, and it was tight. A booth may have been slightly better. Arrived at around 5, and the wait was negligible... maybe 10 minutes. Not bad for a new establishment on a Monday night where there is still plenty of 'novelty'. Although the wait was much longer when we left (~6:15), with plenty of people outside. I really think the franchise underestimated the demand in the area. Adjacent, significantly-larger establishments that have been in operation for a while are still experiencing wait times in excess of an hour. However, the Red Robin standby system uses text messaging to your phone if there is a wait (no silly vibrating-flashy device!), so with a little planning, you can get queued-up in the waiting list and 'wander-away' while your wait time passes. As for the food, as good as expected. On-par with other Red Robins we've visited. The gourmet burgers are excellent, and the fish and chips was quite tasty... all at a reasonable price. Local beers on-tap, with a good selection of national brews. Will certainly return, but we'll request a booth next time. Cheers!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
30,Teri C.,"Pine City, NY",4,5,4.0,4.0,2014-10-11,"I'm going to begin with the positives as a previous reviewer did  I've frequented several red robin locations over the past few years and felt the food was comparable. I also want to be sure they are given a bit of a learning curve as they've been open for approximately 2 weeks.  service was quite good and one great positive was when the server brought our meal, she realized one burger was incorrect. we probably would not have noticed until too late. she was back with the correct burger in seconds making us able to eat our meal together.  staff was friendly and courteous. booths are roomier than table area  If they read this i hope they keep the bus staff away from tables as we had a staff holding a partially full bin right next to my table of food. not particularly pleasant. they need to set up a station and keep bins there.  I would agree with another reviewer that the size of the building is incredibly small making the wait time horrible. we were told 45 minutes and that ended up taking about 75 minutes before being seated.  overall a good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
11,Barry K.,"Painted Post, NY",135,228,281.0,3.0,2014-11-03,"My family and I decided to hit up the new Red Robin on Friday night. We tried to call ahead but they don't allow that.  When we got there they said it was a 45 minute wait. The girl took my cell number and said they would text me now and again when our table was ready.  I LOVE THIS!! It allowed us to go wonder around at the shops nearby rather than sit and wait.  Why don't all places do this????  I got the text 20 minutes later that our table was ready and sure enough it was! The place First thing I noticed is they did a great job with the decor of this place it felt very trendy and cool looking. They even had pictures on the ceiling which I enjoyed.  My only complaint is the place isnt very big. I think they will regret that later but I understand building too big will put you our to business. The food We ordered a couple of milkshakes one Chocolate and Nana-Nana-Moo-Moo first thing I noticed is they are huge it comes with a decent size cup but a metal shake glass that will refill it completely again.  The shakes were ok at best the chocolate tastes like Hershey's syrup it was overly sweet and the other was just ok nothing special.  We ordered an onion tower for an appetizer.  They were good nothing special but solid they came with two sauces which were pretty good. I ordered the Black & Bleu burger which was Sautéed, blackened Portobello mushrooms, grilled onions, house-made Bleu cheese sauce and Bleu cheese crumbles on a toasted Ciabatta bun with Dijon sauce. It was a good burger but for 14.29 a bit pricey.  Yes it came with bottomless fries and the sauces you can dip them in are good but unless you want eat a ton of fries it is a bit pricey.  So overall I liked the but Red Robin is priced high for what you get. The burgers are better than most other chains but at the price point it is a tough call for it to be a go to place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
27,Eric H.,"Elmira, NY",0,1,,1.0,2014-12-30,"Can I give them 0 stars? Do not go here. 30 minute wait for food that was OK but no where near being worth the wait. The food only came after asking the waitress to check on it and it was a good 10 minutes after that.

We waited 10 minutes for a refill and for a side to my son's meal she forgot. The food quality was terrible and the salad I didn't touch.  It had one half peeled cucumber and one cucumber end with skin, all atop a brown lump of iceberg lettuce. Will never go there again.  They facility was nice due to it being new but the restaurant needs a new training program for their cooks and waitresses. The on duty manager didn't seem to care.  I would rate this restaurant a 0 if I could.  Save your money and time and go to Applebees or Five Guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

33,Glen W.,"Slaterville Springs, NY",0,13,,2.0,2015-01-30,"If you have ever been to a Red Robin where the waitstaff is pleased to have another table, where the manager visits to ask you about your meal, where you get served in less than 25 minutes at 8:00 on a Tuesday, and where you weren't asked by a waitress if one of your children were indeed real, then you will have experienced a standard that far exceeds this plaza trap. Truly, there is a, ""we're all in it together"", attitude that the staff extends to you: Like when you have to go to a job you detest with people you can't stand and put in your hours - just 'get through it and get out' so we can go back to our hillside trailer, put on some polyester fleece pajama bottoms, and try to scrape enough roaches out of the ashtray to roll a new one with and try to forget why you ever went to Red Robin - let alone Big Head Horse Flats anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads?start=20,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

The floor was so greasy feeling I almost fell heading out. My burger bun was covered in grease visibly shining in splotches on the top bun, and the whole affair was swimming in mayo and could barely be picked up to eat. The waitress asked if I wanted more fries, then said there aren't any, sorry. We had a problem with one of the orders in our group, which happens sometimes, and the manager dropped off the replacement but had nothing special to say; seemed odd that the waitress asked if the manager had spoken with us, as if there was some message we should have received.
