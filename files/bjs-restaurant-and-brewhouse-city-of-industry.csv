Ronald B.,West Covina  CA,31,31,12,11/14/2017,5.0,I came here assuming I was going to get bad service and cold food like other BJ's that I have been to but this time was different. Joshua R. (#157) was really polite and took his time with us. He understands the that the little things matter. He kept our Drinks filled  he asked us every so often if we needed help  he even asked us if the food was fine before leaving. The food was hot when it arrived and it was also delicious. That's honestly a first for me when going to a BJ's. This man deserves a raise or something because it showed that he cared and that made me realize that I will be coming back to this location even though I live about 40min away. P.S - Anyone who wants to come to eat here should really ask for Joshua R. Before coming. You won't be disappointed.
Cat Toast G.,Rowland Heights  CA,137,167,39,11/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Yeah veterans free beer was total hog wash n the server was rude about it. Could have at least said ""Sorry sir no beer I would like to personally thank u for your service"" nope! He was determined to be a prick to us all night.. He didnt get a tip... I hope being a brat was worth it.  Shoulda went to Applebee\'s. The manager there personally gives you your free beer and thanks you for your service..The server came back and said that only Texas was participating... Really then why was it printed out on my receipt? We probably woulnt be back Ever the service there just sucks period..its been that way for the last 5 years."
Angela T.,El Monte  CA,209,304,171,11/8/2017,2.0,"Talk about snail paced over here.. Party of 6 for lunch and we arrived no later than 12:10pm. We ordered ahead of time on their app just so we can save a little bit of time  but nope. Not the case. We were originally going to be seated at a really small table  but we wanted a larger table and the hostess offered to push two tables together for us (not very nicely  imo). We asked about the booth and we ended up getting seated there  but the hostess clearly showed on her face that she wasn\'t happy about having to move the menus  even though we told her we already ordered via the app. Finally got greeted by our waiter and again had to tell them that we already ordered through the app. He jotted down the order/premiere card number and said he\'s going to get that started right away. We waited for a while and still nothing came. Because we\'re on a one hour lunch  we were short on time. At the about 12:35  we followed up on our order and was told he\'s checking up on it. Within 2 minutes  4 of the 6 items showed up  but weren\'t hot. We had two lemon thyme chickens missing and followed up  but were told that ""it\'s being prepared"". About 2 minutes later  a woman who seemed like the manager came out with our food and said they were having ""system failures"" and the food had to be punched in manually after. Which means that they forgot our order initially... and probably forgot to bring out the food because the center of the chicken was warm. The food itself was mediocre. The lemon thyme chicken was way too salty and the brown rice underneath was really soggy from either the veggies or whatever sauce they had from the chicken. In the end  we did get a 20% off discount  but for majority of this  nobody really bothered to tell us what was going on and they were not very apologetic about it either."
Rebecca W.,Rowland Heights  CA,314,225,431,10/5/2017,4.0,EDDIE IS SO SWEET AND THE BEST SERVER EVER. Very chill and funny guy. Knows his drinks and great recommendations. Food: tried the bison burger and I guess it's ok? Yes  the Pattie was juicy and med rare. So that was good. But the taste overall lacked a bit. There was a good kick. Instead  I tasted raw onion that kinda burned instead. The fries are good though! Crispy and yummy!Got to sample the beers and I think I like the one similar to Blue Moon the most. Pizza was pretty good too! Long Island was not as strong as I imagined...pretty light actually. I already drank this strawberry bj favorites and that was pretty good. On the sweet slushie side but again  not too strong. The margarita was stronger actually. I felt like the margarita was the strongest compared to all the other drinks I tried.  Service: like I mentioned  Eddie was great. Patient  nice  and helpful. Good came out at a good speed as well. Thanks for the great night!Overall  it was good. The wait was around 8 minutes? So not too long. Worth coming!
Andy N.,West Covina  CA,153,36,163,12/3/2017,5.0,Bringing some friend here for lunch  love there pizzas  get you a lot of meat and veggies.
Shannon H.,Irvine  CA,322,94,165,9/25/2017,1.0,Worst customer service ever. I had a gift card that my brother payed for and sent it to me via email. I ordered food thinking it was ok and could be used. The manager Shawn refused to take the gift card saying they do not accept gift cards without a pin. There was a pin on my gift card but he refused to take it. My brother took the online code gift card to BJs in his area and it was used without an issue. I have been a long time customer of BJs. My family loves it. However after this incident we will no longer be coming back. The manager was rude. I was very disappointed. The staff always follows the leadership. If they have such a rude leader  they will service clients in the same manner. I will be getting in contact with corporate to discuss this issue considering this gift card was purchased from BJs. Do not come here if you want to have a nice family dinner where the manager actually does his job instead of making you more upset. I ended up not paying for the food because it was supposed to be charged to the gift card that my brother ordered up north. What a waste of time and food. This is the most disappointing interaction I have ever had with a manager at a large chain restaurant.
Angel P.,Whittier  CA,0,17,12,11/22/2017,2.0,Nothing special here besides the desert. Appetizers tasted and looked like they were out of a frozen aisle at the grocery store and main course lacked flavor and everything was overpriced for the quality
Joyce Y.,Alhambra  CA,47,361,230,10/6/2017,2.0,came for a coworkers farewell lunchi ordered the quinoa and added salmon. came at normal lunch time (around noon) and it was pretty empty. it took forever to get anything. from our orders to the check. started getting antsy we were waiting so long. finally had to take matters into our own hands and someone from our party got up to track down somebody to give us our check. foods a little overpriced  at least my salmon was. probably wouldn't go again unless a coworker wanted to go.located in a mall plaza so parking a plenty.
Wendy S.,Walnut  CA,0,19,27,10/22/2017,5.0,My hubby and I were just here the other day after a long of work on Thursday took noticed they've added new menu items with some great daily special offers. We took special noticed on their Prime Rib dinner on Sunday all day for $26.95. So we thought why not give it a try. Man we are so glad we did! Their Prime Rib special is totally worth the price. It came with a choice of soup or salad  2-sides plus a regular size pizooki. I had their Clam Chowder and my hubby decided on their Tortilla Soup. Both were very tasty. We thought it was going to be a cup of soup but instead it was a regular bowl of soup. Their asparagus  french fries and fully loaded baked potato were all delish! Our server was great! He was friendly and very attentive. My hubby of course always orders their handcraft root beer which is made with sugarcane vs regular sugar. Since we were so full from our dinner  we decided to take home our desserts for some late night snack :DWe are so totally coming back for more. Definitely worth the time to go through their menu each time you're here as we've noticed they add new menu items over time with some great special offers. They have weekday and weekend specials so be sure to take notice and plan as accordingly ;p
Loretta C.,Los Angeles  CA,3498,950,21263,3/20/2017,3.0,This is an okay restaurant. I have gone for coworker outings and both the food and service can be really inconsistent each time. Sometimes the food is amazing and blows you away  but for the most part it is too salty. For the customer service too  it feels very fake from the females versus the males.Over all  my go-to consistent items to get are the appetizers. Other than that  the food is salty and drinks can get pricey:1) Avocado Egg Rolls - This seems like something anyone can make themselves but they are so amazing! Perfectly hot inside and crispy outside  they are fun to dip in the sweet tamarind sauce!2) Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo - This has a little bit of everything  including Chips with Spinach and Artichoke Dip  Mozzarella Sticks  Avocado Egg Rolls and Boneless Wings. I love trying each item with different sauces!3) Crisp Potato Skins Platter - These are pretty delicious  mainly because I'm biased and love potatoes!
Elizabeth K.,Los Angeles  CA,393,455,780,6/7/2017,4.0,Good customer service! Nice and friendly as well! Constantly readily available to assist me during the visit! The breakfast menu was decently priced! I got the scrambled egg with sourdough. The egg was a bit dry and the sourdough bread was super hard and not that chewy! I think all the food was overlooked to the max. Not that good for BJ quality. Brunch cost approximately $10-12 bucks. Seats are comfy. Restrooms are clean for the most part! Pizookies are bomb!
Karen K.,Alhambra  CA,588,630,607,7/29/2017,3.0,There will always be a need for mediocre pan-American restaurants like BJ's. They can cater to large groups  and a diversity of different dietary needs and tastes at a price that is reasonable. I've been to this BJ's a few times throughout the course of my life  and it appears to be relatively consistent with the quality of most BJ's. They were able to cater to a large group with relatively no hiccups. I ordered the Sirloin Steak  medium  with a side of cauliflower and a side of brussel sprouts. The Sirloin was a tad bit more medium well than medium  but it wasn't bad. It was about a palm-sized  fat chunk of meat with no unpleasant bits of fat  or bone  or tough bits. Although it didn't have much circumference  because of it's width  I surprisingly could not finish it by the time the rest of my coworkers were done with their meal. It made it's way into my midnight snack itinerary. It was very consistently meat  all the way through. There was a rosy hue in the middle without a trace of blood. The Siracha Brussel Sprouts  while not being the best brussel sprouts I've had at an establishment  were surprisingly good for BJ's. There was plenty of it  and it was well cooked and flavorful  but not too spicy (if you are a light-weight). This was my favorite part of my meal  and I will order it again. The Curried Cauliflower wasn't as tasty. They had a bit of curried flavor and lentil  but it overall did not match with any of the flavors on my plate  and were probably one of the more disappointing curried dishes I've tried in my life. I make a better curried cauliflower and lentil at home. I would pass on this side  especially considering it is a premium item  and costs a little bit extra. I skipped on the pazookie  this time  but BJ's is known for it. It is a thick  super sweet  monster sized cookie that was meant to be shared by at least 3 people. (It is much too sweet for any less than 3  in my opinion.)
Robin I.,Fullerton  CA,9,80,190,10/13/2017,3.0,The food is ok. Got a small Sweet Pig Pizza with a Caesar salad and some Mozzarella Sticks. Also got a Monkey Bread Pizookie. The food was nothing special. The service was average and our waitress was not the greatest. But I got to have a nice date with my wife. Nice.
Raina H.,Walnut  CA,1015,79,219,8/8/2017,4.0,Came here after downloading the online app that got us $10 off a $35 order and it was free pazookie day!!Everything was great  we got seated right away and our server was extremely friendly. I was treating my sister out for a birthday lunch and we were so excited because their menu was so extensive! Their special on Wednesday was unlimited fries with their burgers! Only $10 such a great deal so that's what I opted for- to make our meal $35  my sister got the Mediterranean chicken tacos and sauted kale and spinach with buffalo boneless chicken wings for an appetizer- everything tasted pretty good but what's bringing down the rating is the wings.They were extremely extremely dry and hard to eat  very tough  not worth getting at all in my opinion but everything else was delicious  my burgers  the fresh batches of fries that kept coming out everytime we finished - My peach drink was also very good but the only thing that bothered me was they don't mix it well with the tea and I didn't know so I slurpee a ton of syrup on my first try. But the refills for my tea came out very fast  our server was extremely on point ! Overall is was a pleasant experience and I highly recommend getting their app if you ever feel like dining in  savings and earning points! :)
Alicia D.,San Bernardino  CA,29,9,,11/18/2017,3.0,Mozzarella sticks were cold. Never brought out our avocado wraps. Waiter took a while to come back and check on us..Ended up canceling the avocado wraps after we were done with our main course and they still hadn't brought them out. Other than that  the clam chowder was good and so was the pizza.
Rachel Q.,Monterey Park  CA,872,1283,1820,1/27/2017,4.0,I don't go to BJ's often but when I do  I really enjoy the pizza and the pazookie! The beer selection is also very good and they have this new rewards app that gets you a free pazookie the first time you use it!The last time I came here it was Wine Tuesday! The brussell sprouts appetizer was delicious and crispy. I also got the Ahi Tuna Salad  but it was a little fishy  but the waiter was happy to exchange it  which was nice. And of course polished off the meal with a chocolate chip pazookie! Staff is really friendly and helpful  and parking is easy. Overall a good experience.
Monica S.,San Dimas  CA,0,33,17,11/19/2017,1.0,Ughhhh! Stopped by just for the Pizookie....didn't even get one because I was so irritated with our server Michelle. She came back to our table once to check on us  ONCE! The restaurant wasn't crowded  so I don't know what was up! Plain ridiculous! I even had to pay up front because she never came back to pick up the bill! SMH!!!!
Adriana O.,Monrovia  CA,0,4,,11/19/2017,5.0,Been coming here for a couple years now everything from food  service to cleanliness has always been great when I come by. Love this BJs and I will continue to come to this one!
Dinasia W.,Springfield Gardens  NY,9,67,111,9/2/2017,5.0,We stopped in BJs just to have a drink & some apps. We did just that. Tasty drinks ( pink Cadillac martini & peach margarita) we both had two. Not overly strong but very tasty. Nashville pepper wings (promotional) and crispy calamari. Both appetizers were good but the wings were GREAT. Not like typical chain restaurant wings. Our server was awesome ! Sorry I can't remember his name . I will revisit this location. Btw we came on a Saturday around 6pm. Waited about 5-7minutes for a table. No complaints!
Jose P.,Brea  CA,129,28,48,9/9/2017,1.0,"Late night atrocious ""snack""! Ordered the Peruvian quinoa shrimp: under cooked quinoa  salty shrimp  and too many sour tomatoes. Disappointed :(They don\'t have to-go cups for drinks :("
Jane R.,Mission Viejo  CA,42,109,257,8/28/2016,3.0,Just had lunch here  it was busy but not ridiculously so for the size of the venue. Perhaps they need more serving staff.. Despite having a reservation they still take a good ten minutes to show us to our table that is empty.. They seem to have a very slow way of seating everyone group by group in this laborious wayDrinks orders were taken quickly but possibly because it then takes quite a while to get the food order in **Free appetizer with Yelp check in! Potato Skins with Bacon and Cheese  a bit dry but not bad for free :p **I had Salmon with Cous Cous  the sauce is very sweet but it was OK.. The salmon was nicely cooked. The asparagus is too thin to be pan fried/grilled it needs to be steamed or use the thicker style asparagus. It's like eating a dry plant The server was polite and friendly for our table  prices are reasonable.. One last comment 'silver ware' normally means a knife and fork.. No one on our table received a knife apart from the one eating steak- too difficult to get any of the busy servers attention to ask for them!
Elle Y.,San Francisco  CA,0,7,,8/30/2017,4.0,My brother and I came here after an exhausting day and it hit the spot. My bro enjoyed his California Club sandwich and I had the chicken caesar with chicken. The restaurant was the perfect amount of cool (not freezing and not stifling) for a 105 day in SoCal.I really wish I could remember our server's name (I didn't take the receipt with me). He was a sweetheart and so helpful.
Vittal Kumar G.,Coppell  TX,50,7,,11/25/2017,4.0,Typical BJ's. Excellent ambience  great food and fast service. Always loved visiting this place. Good place to stop by for few drinks after work.
Alexander M.,San Marino  CA,136,241,110,7/21/2017,2.0,Ordered BJ's through DoorDash since I had guests over  the thin crust pizza must've been made by a BJ employee who didn't wear his glasses since the pizza was very oddly shaped and cut unusual. Thank goodness I had ordered the spaghetti with meatballs which made correctly.
Melissa R.,Whittier  CA,7,16,1,10/21/2017,1.0,Stop using DoorDash they make an embarrassment out of your company. They take 2 hours to deliver your food  if the order is to small they'll accept the delivery but won't bring it. Your better than this terrible service that represents your company
Sue Y.,Northwest Washington  Washington  DC,51,9,59,5/26/2017,3.0,I come here for their special on Monday is half off pizza and Thursday is ribs. I am a reward member and they give out tons of special deals. Sometimes free appetizer or BOGO deals. But their food sometimes is good and sometimes it comes out too salty and taste different. My overall experience is I only come when they run specials or deals. For their regular price  I can get much better food out there .
Carlos R.,Baldwin Park  CA,29,3,3,10/6/2017,1.0,After an hour of being seated our appetizer has not made it to our table while other tables that got here after are already halfway of their food. Defiantly a let down and would reconsider this location. Hostess was terrible
Serena L.,Bellevue  WA,42,255,1351,5/30/2016,3.0,"I got to try out Bj\'s for our company lunch. We started with the ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"". This combo included four different appetizers; Spinach and Artichoke Dip  Mozzarella Sticks  Avocado Egg Rolls and Boneless Wings with choice of signature sauce or dry rub. The appetizer was just okay to me. I ordered their new ""Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl""; Roasted Atlantic salmon with sauted red onions  mushrooms  fresh asparagus and fire-roasted red bell peppers served over quinoa and drizzled with soy ginger sauce. It was pretty healthy and yummy!At the end  we ordered a huge Pizookie as dessert! Warm cookie with cold icecream  what can be better than this?"
David B.,Whittier  CA,20,6,5,9/10/2017,3.0,They have really institutionalized inefficiency here. This time and last they served food without utensils and didn't provide them for 15 minutes. We had to request additional salad dressing (the cesaer was very dry) 4 times... still no place settings. They eventually come through but it is really annoying.
Robert W.,West Covina  CA,0,5,,11/13/2017,1.0,I don't complain on Yelp  but there is a first for everything. Worst service ever!! My 12 year old has more intelligence and better people skills than the people that work here! I have had better service at McDonald's..
Jennifer T.,Glendale  CA,3,15,19,6/30/2017,4.0,I came out here with my homegirl on a Friday afternoon. BJ's pazookie and beers never fails. The staff was also very nice despite some minor tablet problems. Lol. I'll be back just because it's close to my homegirls house and it's a guaranteed tasty quick bite. Enjoy life. Share a Pazookie!
Gloria D.,La Puente  CA,0,17,,9/24/2017,3.0,I haven't been here in a while. The food was good and flavorful. I had the Brussel Sprout salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Chicken Alfredo. The garlic bread sucked. The place wasn't even full and our waitress was rushing us. I had to tell her to please let us enjoy our lunch. I didn't like that. Will not be returning anytime soon.
Mickie W.,Temple City  CA,529,162,95,9/8/2016,4.0,Our server Steven A. was great. We had a party of 20 and knowing how complicated it can be  he was was 100% respectful and made our dinner fly by even though the first server messed up on an item.Whenever I get BJ's I get their Deep Dish Pizza- California Supreme with a side salad. Pair it with either Calamari or Avocado Egg Roll and you'll be satisfied.
Elmen O.,La Puente  CA,9,6,3,8/26/2017,3.0,They used to be much better. For example  they used to have three items on their menu which they no longer have; one being the bacon cheeseburger pizza  second was there Derek Favorite Meat loaf sandwich  and the last but not least was these huge baked potatoes that had broccoli with Alfredo sauce and chicken. There service is mediocre.
Allen F.,Cerritos  CA,217,134,276,4/14/2017,3.0,So the service was all squared away not that are server way bad but he was taking care of the whole bar seating you think some one would help the guy  but he was some how able to take care of every one in a timely manner. As for the kitchen how is that you guys over cook the sampler player it was all over cooked the spinach dip  the avocado rolls an they skimmed out on the rolls as well on got one when your supper to get two then they cut them in half. Over cooked in a microwave. Some one i. The lichen dong know how to use a microwave or y'all need a new one. Thursday night an no rush at 10:00 come on BJs. No happy ending.
Juan R.,Monrovia  CA,0,11,4,7/11/2017,1.0,Server couldn't take an order for a pazookie correctly. Second time I get crappy service here. Never coming back.
Julianne J.,Rexburg  ID,0,7,,8/14/2017,5.0,My husband and I both really enjoy the chicken Alfredo and their homemade root beer. Both are delicious! We also appreciate their late hours.
Bill L.,West Covina  CA,1,3,,8/14/2017,1.0,This is probably the worst BJ i've ever gotten. The service is terrible  and on my birthday too! When i got my free pizookie  they didn't even sing happy birthday to me! Horrible!
Yushan W.,Monterey Park  CA,1009,523,1517,5/19/2016,3.0,Came here with my coworkers for lunch. This place is huge and it was not crowded at all during lunch hours. I can see this place getting crowded during sports game season since they have a lot of beer selection and TV. Just like every other chain restaurant selling American food  there is really nothing to rave about for the food here. Their food portion was also huge. My favorite was their avocado egg rolls because I am personally an avocado lover and they combine two delicious food together  fried item and avocado. It was super crispy and delicious. I also had their pasta item but it was huge and flavor was totally off. Parking is plaza parking.
Randy L.,Irvine  CA,141,191,270,7/14/2016,5.0,The food was great and the service was excellent. Ask to be seated in ANDREW's section. Andrew was very professional As is the entire serving staff.
Marie P.,Hacienda Heights  CA,934,97,947,9/6/2015,5.0,I've eaten at this Bj several times and I don't know why I haven't written a review for it. I really love the location of this place. It really is surrounded by many restaurants. Its very close to my house which is a plus. They have a really great happy hour! Who wouldn't love good food at a cheaper price! I've never had a bad experience here. Staff is always friendly and very efficient. Which for me makes the whole dining experience even better!The deep dish pizzas are always good! I've had the Bj favorite and it is so packed with so much flavor! And that crispy crust  yummo!!! Now on to my absolute favorite  pizookie! What is not to like about a warm cookie and a huge scoop of ice cream on it!! Genius! All the flavors are so good! But my ultimate favorite is the white chocolate with macadamia nut! If you seriously haven't tried a pizookie  your definitely missing out!!
Lesley C.,West Covina  CA,418,509,24,7/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I think BJ's just really want to dry us out with their overly salty food. Or try to make money from us by having us want to order more drinks to quench our thirst. Two for $252x Chowder Bowls1x Large Mediterranean1x Peanut Butter PizookieThey had the 2 for $25 deal a few weeks back and I thought to try out BJ's again  since it's been years. Not only was I super disappointed with the taste of the chowder bowls and the Mediterranean Pizza  I really just had a hard time finishing most of my half of the meal. Halfway through  I just really wanted to dump everything  except for the Pizookie because my health is more important than a couple of bucks. Learned my lesson. Don't ever come here for food. Other than the food  takeout service was swift. Phoned in my order and it was ready by the time I had arrived for pick up. There was a bit of confusion as how to process the 2 for $25 in the register but a manager helped the staff out.
Jennifer I.,West Covina  CA,2,5,3,2/24/2017,5.0,Try the BBQ salmon. IT IS LIFE CHANGING. I love mashed potatoes& I love salmon but depending how it's prepared it may taste fishy. The bbq sauce gives it a sweet flavor & the sides are sorta burnt (but not too burnt to a crisp) taste. The crispy onions & broccoli make a really good pair. I loved the salmon so much I overlooked my white cheddar mashed potatoes.
Gilbert L.,West Covina  CA,0,4,,10/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,10/7/17  not really familiar with the city of industry and as I drove through the city looking for something to eat I passed by this Bj's. I stopped by Bj's for dinner and as soon as I stepped In I was greeted very nicely by the hostess which made me feel really welcomed. I believed her name was Marsala and I was seated very quickly the atmosphere was really great and the food was really good. Leaving the restaurant the hostess even said goodnight and a thank you for coming  really positive atmosphere and will definitely be returning back. Thanks !
Tracey N.,Cerritos  CA,74,48,22,6/21/2016,1.0,"Customer Service was awful. I can understand a long wait for food if the kitchen\'s backed up. I can understand not getting our food order right away. But I cannot accept a poor attitude with it. Been here several times with coworkers during lunch  so didn\'t think any issues going to BJs for lunch. Unfortunately we came on a day where our waitress had the worst attitude imaginable. Knew there was a problem when she took our order. When my boss had a question about a deal he saw on the app  she quickly threw down his throat she has 6 other tables that need help  and that shell take care of it at the end. She never came back to apologize for the wait  forgot to bring out my coworkers hot water. But surprisingly  she was attentive to the surrounding tables around us. I\'m sure their experience was much better than ours. 50 min after ordering with no food  we decide we can\'t be any later back to work  and ask for our food to be boxed up. My boss again ask the waitress politely  and she quickly tells him ""well its coming out now"". 10 min later  our food comes out from a different waitress  plated. Again we explain we need it boxed up  so we could all eat at our desk at work.Its just unreal how poor this experience was. No one was yelling or being rude to her  we just wanted to leave in peace at this point. Of course  our bill is wrong  and we have to get her attention to fix it. Whole experience took 1 hour and 45 min  without eating a thing... And again  what really irked all of us about this experience was how unapologetic she was. If she had just showed any customer service  where I could really see it wasn\'t her fault  I would\'ve been fine about the whole experience. But unfortunately  this experience has left a poor taste in my mouth for BJs."
Stephanie R.,West Covina  CA,1,13,5,10/21/2016,1.0,"I really hate that this is the closest Bjs location for me. The employees at this location give the worst customer service. Most of the servers (I\'ve been here many times and have been served by most of the regularly staffed waiters/waitress) do not know how to smile  make eye contact or even give an inviting hello. It seems like many are so stuck up! It baffles me how so many people are staffed here and no one seems to even want to be there. I\'m not a hard to please customer but I do know what\'s to be expected in proper customer service. I can\'t even list the amount of faults this location has bc it will be never ending. However my last experience was far too much. My sister and I spent over 2+ hours on this specific Monday night waiting and waiting for just 1 pizza and 1 pizookie. Our waiter never did care to help us and never offered us refills or brought utensils after bringing our food so cold and late. (We waited so long we just ate without even caring for the temp) yada yada. Not cool. We also ordered a pizookie and waited and waited and when I made eye contact with the waiter he was was ""shocked"" that we hadn\'t received our desert and came back with a almost black cookie! SO hard and cold! And said ""enjoy"" !?! It was so unbelievably burnt and he still brought it out thinking it would be presentable?! Wow.  I practically chipped my tooth trying to eat that ""pizookie"". Oh well. The experience wasent as shocking to me bc I\'ve had many experiences like the one mentioned above at this location. I have spoken with HR or whatever or wherever they\'re complains go to with no help at all. Overall  very bad location  won\'t be coming back. Ever."
Frances Y.,Anaheim  CA,0,19,,7/16/2017,3.0,Poor service . One person in party did not get his food with everybody else. At least the manager comped him Poor guy had to woof down his food because we were on a time schedule. Chicken on salad was dry . Other person had a chicken breast that was pounded so flat that it looked like cardboard. Need improvement!!
Ophelia C.,La Puente  CA,2,13,4,5/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I don\'t know why I keep giving this BJ\'S a chance - I\'m so done. Service is still TERRIBLE!!! The server I got this time took forever w/everything. I didn\'t get my drink until I was 1/2 done with my meal  she\'d forget side dishes etc. We got a nice ""rolling of the eyes"" when we\'d remind her about our food. Go to West Covina  they\'re always nice and attentive."
Tao L.,Chatsworth  CA,43,11,5,2/11/2017,2.0,2 Stars for good pizza and jambalaya.Service was abysmal. Came in around 10PM with a party of 5 to a decently full restaurant. Initially staff was attentive. As time went on  service became non-existent. Waited 30+ minutes for a pizookie to come out  and the thing was room temperature. Server never bothered to bring us the check until we went and asked for it.I've never had a bad experience at a BJ's before this. Avoid this location.
Daisy M.,West Covina  CA,79,11,2,11/14/2017,2.0,Only reason I am giving 2 stars its not always horrible when I go but I hate doing that coin flip thing  I have only had a hand full of good waiters there but always seems that I every time I go now I get the same waiter.... now I wouldn't mind this if he wasn't such a rude guy  I have had him twice and both times he had the biggest attitude I have every seen  First time it was a double date and we had told him from the beginning we are splitting the checks and we got one check which is fine we just kindly remind him we are paying separately and he rolled his eyes and came back 10 min. Later and we paid our separate checks and that was that  but he had the audacity to tell us if you guys are paying in cash just pool your money next time it makes it easier on us waiters  I get it I work in the food industry too but I don't think he should make comments like that towards us  very unprofessional  second time was when I had a gathering of 15 people for my birthday  now we weren't being to complicated we only split the check 3 ways  which again I know its difficult but better than being 10 different checks  mind you I was celebrating my birthday  so I am trying to have a good time  have a few drinks and eat dinner with my friends and family  again same waiter and he goes through taking the orders  looks annoyed and probably doesn't want to be there but whatever  everyone orders and we wait  some of the food or drinks never came out and we were still charged we asked him to remove the items because they never came and he was like  I can bring them out now (one hour later than we had ordered them) but he keeps insisting we just accept it but we declined and just asked him to remove the items because we don't want them anymore we were ready to head out  I haven't gone back to bjs since this  so it has been since June and Im scared to go back but if I do I swear if I get this waiter again I will either ask for someone else or leave  I will maybe try again in a few months for now I will take my service elsewhere.
Mel B.,Ewa Beach  HI,329,574,5396,6/9/2015,5.0,I've been to several BJs but mostly to the West Covina location. To find out there actually was one now in Hacienda Hts.  in my neck of the woods  was interesting and a good suggestion by Mark M. to hook up at.It was my last night to be back in town and I was looking forward to a relaxing meeting with a fellow yelper I met online. It was real kewl to find out we had very similar interests and that he actually visited my area of business many  many times but we never met.The place looks amazing with it's awesome ambiance. Not too noisy. As I we sit the waitress introduces herself and gives us time to order. It's been awhile and I'm interested to find out what they have in their home brew selection. However  Mark H. orders a drink  forgot the name  and it just sounded interesting. Some sort of tropical  fruity drink. I tell the waitress let me have the same. When it is delivered  it looks like a Tequila Sunrise (no tequila though) and tastes very similar. Just what I needed to relax.Mark M. and I start talking getting familiar with ourselves enjoying the stories and discovering other likes. The waitress checks in on us on occasion to see if we need anything else. As we continue into the night  the shift manager introduces herself and starts to check with us for the rest of the night. I see the 1st waitress but for some reason the shift manager or maybe supervisor checks with our status. We're milking the 1st drink. I just didn't want to drink any more on this trip knowing I'll be flying the next day  back to reality.I enjoyed the hospitality and the new friendship made and look forward to his trip to the islands later this year. When I am back here again you can bet your bottoms up I will be visiting this BJs with a bunch of me amigos!!
Tom V.,West Covina  CA,262,84,587,2/19/2017,1.0,Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 11. They told us they were super busy and the wait would be one hour. Finally were seated. Order taken without issue. Evening turned south when meals arrived. They brought the wrong soup. Asked for tortilla and was given tomato. Told them it was wrong. They said oh ok and walked away. Had to wait for his return (bearded server) and had to convince him to fix it. He brought the correct soup and had the nerve to charge for both soups. The tortilla soup was completely not edible. Tasted like Herdez warmed up in the microwave. Never came back to check on us. Was trying to avoid us? Finally when it was time to pay  we did ask for separate checks. He told us he could only break it up to 4 separate checks. He waved his arms at us as he walked away saying for us to figure out. We would have tipped him really good for our size group. But his actions  behavior  and quality of food told us otherwise. So avoid this location. There are better restaurants next door and across the street.
Ray L.,Irvine  CA,235,433,879,4/21/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Back again....This time I bought another friend...we had a pitcher of Blonde...and then Fried Calamari...then a medium sweet pig pizza. I was full. The beer and foods were good.This is a good place.
LenaNbul R.,La Puente  CA,6,28,105,9/19/2016,1.0,Service was awful and they served up a desert the was bad rotten or something it's smelled like BO no joke I even had the waitress smell it she was like OMG WHATS THAT SMELL !! Yeah never again!!!!
S-Goddess V.,La Puente  CA,132,685,3843,2/18/2016,1.0,"Once a week I take my parents out to lunch and we normally have asian food  but this time I wanted them to try something different. I decided to take them here... Our server was wonderful  however  the reason for my single star review is for the boy that brought our food. When I placed our order I specifically asked for ranch on my salad  and EXTRA ranch ON THE SIDE. When the kid brought out the two plates  I immediately noticed there was NO ranch on the salad  he seemed as if he was in a hurry so I informed him that there was no ranch on the salad and that I had asked for ranch and ranch on the side. He looks to me and says  ""Yea  well I only have two hands"" then walks away  I was in disbelief in his response that all I could say was ""OH"" as he walked awayafter just having processed his response  I was pissed because my parents noticed how rude he was  my father blamed his age and told me not to make a big deal out of it  but I just cant!!! He had to be handled  his age is no excuse for his behavior. He brought A SINGLE RANCH with his TWO hands  didn\'t say a word  set it on the table and left. I wanted to say so badly  ""YOU HAVE TWO HANDS BUT BROUGHT OUT ONE RANCH?!"" But my parents were present so I had to maintain my good girl behavior. Shortly  after that  I walked straight up to the receptionist and asked to speak to a manager.I waited there for a good while  manager was a no show. The girl finally came back out and told me that I could sit back down and the manager will walk over to our table.twenty minutes finally pass  our food came out  manager finally arrived and listened to what I had to say  she seemed as if she sympathized  but I doubt it. I\'ve been a manager in customer service work for years and I know that customer service is critical in a striving business  I understand that a customer\'s satisfaction should be the utmost priority  she did not attempt to make us happy  NOT that I was expecting anything for free. But she could have at LEAST asked if she could bring us anything. ten minutes passed and the kid comes back to the table he tells me that his manager told him that he was being rude to us  he looked at me and I straight up said the same thing I told his manager. His response: ""yeah Im just tired I guess"" Uhh  really? I\'m a full time student AND work 12-13 hour days the days I don\'t have school--so  being tired is NO EXCUSE! Might I add  he was walking away while I was still talking to him  so I guess he is just a tired incompetent kid.I will not be back!"
Auau V.,West Covina  CA,260,77,8,5/21/2017,1.0,I had the prime rib... It wasn't very good. They served it without au jus ... So I asked for some a few times before they brought it . The meat was cold and hard . The au jus was sweet   which I'm not use to . I'm use to prime rib au jus savory . I just wasn't impressed at all. A bit disappointing.
Belle L.,Phoenix  AZ,2,23,18,6/12/2017,1.0,Such awful customer service! We waited 10 minutes for drinks  20 mins to order and we had to ask for bread which took 20 mins to come out...when we asked the waitress for water with no ice she rolled her eyes and said ok....like what! And when we complained to the manager he didn't even say sorry or compensate us with anything.
Nicole C.,Downey  CA,0,7,6,9/5/2016,1.0,Me and my boyfriend love bj's. But we didn't like this specific bj's. We got a table right when we walked in which was good because I'm a person who hates to wait for a table especially if I'm starving. But we got sat down and it took someone 20 min just to ask if we wanted water. That's just bad customer service for me. I asked the waiter for a discount because no one should wait that long to be asked for a cup of water. We ordered our food right there and than & got our food fast but it was just the worst experience at this bj's. & the general manager was thoughtful and took 10$ off our check. But I will never go back here. I would rate 0 if it was possible but for taking $10 off our check you guys can have 1 star. ;p lol
Judy a.,Ontario  CA,26,253,184,4/25/2017,5.0,I went here for a birthday party  I never knew you could have a private party in the back  I really enjoyed the whole set up  endless pizza salad and drinks  I will definitely consider having a party here myself  The buffalo chicken pizza is the Business.
Carol L.,Walnut  CA,0,20,,6/7/2017,1.0,"This review is on their customer service. If there is a zero star  I will choose that. I called today (Wednesday) at 7:30 to make a reservation for party of 11 for Saturday. The lady who answered the call said "" we are in the middle of rush hour. Call back later."" I thought she said she would call back  and she said ""no  you will have to call back later. "" I could not believe my ears. I called another BJ and made a dinner reservation without problem."
Kerri P.,Santa Monica  CA,101,190,165,8/20/2016,2.0,"How does it take three tries to get potato skins without bacon right??? The manager came out frustrated and said ""apparently my kitchen doesn\'t know how to make anything without bacon."""
Dennis L.,West Covina  CA,8,26,32,9/1/2016,4.0,I had the BJ cheeseburger and it was very Juicy! The service was really good the noise was not loud at all and overall I enjoyed my experience at this location. Will come here again!
Gabriel T.,West Covina  CA,137,157,323,3/26/2016,3.0,Our server Bruce was great. Very courteous and prompt. However the steak was terrible.. over cooked  and too salty. Bad food experience to what is usually a good time a BJs.3 stars for service only.
Geena B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,14,6,2/26/2017,2.0,We sit at the bar to finish watching the Lakers lose. We are greeted with an awesome waiter Eddie. We order our drinks and apps. Order our food  all is good. Theres a gnat flying around in the restaurant/bar. No bueno. We have food still sitting out. We asked for boxes  to avoid the nats getting to our food. #1 gnats in a restaurant GROSS#2 gnats no bueno But we wanted to get our drink on. We planned on boxing up our food then ordering more drinks. Gnats dont like beer or alcohol Eddie brinks me my tab. I laughed and said we weren't done  meaning i was still willing to spend more money on drinks despite the gnats s and all. Instead of being happy he'd get more of my money  he was insulted that i was not in a hurry to leave.  Or that i called him out on his eager rush to send me on my way.Wait isn't it customary to ask  if i will have dessert  wait u guys usually ask did i leave room for dessert. At no time was that question asked. Yet Eddie continued on about his shift being non chalant  unengaged and insulted that i was not ready to leave. WtfDidnt like how he only asked my husband if he wanted water  or anymore drinks. Hello i am at the same table. Even after i paid the tab  and tipped him well  despite his attitude. I like to tip well  i appreciate the food service industy  yet he didnt come by to say thank you  come again  thats ok maybe i wont  ill take my money elsewhere. Yard house  lazy dog  cpk  kabuki  anywhere but here.
Connie K.,La Mirada  CA,40,24,14,5/7/2017,3.0,So I haven't been to BJs in Awhile and I went last Friday and order The Great White large pizza and it was amazing ! Service was just Ok we were a party of 9 but that shouldn't matter never got our appetizer the calamari so was disappointed that I had to mention it didn't come to the table she did remove it from the bill but not the point ! It was a birthday celebration and we accidentally left a gift at the table when we got to the car we realized so went back and the waitress and bus people were rummaging through the gift instead of giving it to the front and leaving it for us to pick up really sad to walk up and to see everything out from the bag so that's why they get a three food was awesome service not-so-good and disappointed at the waitresses actions about the gift left on the table BJ check your Waiter.
Cecilia S.,Claremont  CA,0,80,4,4/29/2017,1.0,Worse service ever. Took forever to bring my husband's tea. Never brought requested water. Second glass of wine came after our dessert arrived  yet ordered before. Manager came over and asked how everything was. 7;30 and restaurant does not even have a wait list. Enough said. Will stick to West Covina BJ. Get your act together.
Joseph L.,Los Angeles  CA,426,233,659,12/29/2015,2.0,BJ's = cookie cutter restaurant.I always leave BJ's feeling cheated. I always forget that it tastes like a TV dinner someone popped into their microwave.The food is always way too salty no matter how many times I let my waiter or waitress know. I mean  I don't blame them. This location gets pretty busy during lunch hour so if you have an hour lunch you'd be pressed on time here. The lunch specials are not bad but not the greatest either.The best part of BJ's is probably still the pizookie apart from that I'm left a bit broken hearted.
Coleen G.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,6,2,5/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Went there for my son's birthday and nothing but issues with waiter. Spoke to manager the following day about all the issues we had. She said she would send some certificates out. This happened in May. Still no certificates. Not too interested in going back to this location. Manager said she should send gift card to apologize. That never happened. A year later (yesterday)  his girlfriend took him for his birthday. Twice they asked for his birthday Pazookie and he never did get it. The restaurant was not very busy. They had two different waiters at their table. They ended up walking out with no Pazookie. Seriously though  the service at this location absolutely sucks!!!!
Gaston V.,San Dimas  CA,59,33,3,4/6/2017,1.0,Service use to be pretty decent here. Food was good but not sure what's up with this bus boy  perhaps server by the name of Steve. He was annoyed when we asked him for a fork  then annoyed when we asked him for a refill. I thought servers were suppose to serve? Perhaps that makes too much sense. Good was still decent. Hopefully managements can look at these reviews and make some adjustment to the quality of service at this place.
Connor K.,Hacienda Heights  CA,94,125,19,8/26/2016,2.0,Not much to say about this place. It is a decent chain and people go because they want something familiar. The service has been poor at times  incredibly rude on one occassion and after that I swore I would not go back to this location. The food is mediocre and typical of a chain restaurant with too many items. A lot of options and none of them excellent. Prices are a bit high but the ambiance is nice enough. It is one of the few chains I can be convinced to eat at. Mostly though  the smaller restautants are almost always better run with better food because they do not rely on a big brand name.
April L.,Pomona  CA,1,7,,5/11/2017,5.0,I always come to this location since it's down the street from my work but yesterday I ordered to-go since I was in the area. I was able to place my order at 4 and was able to pick it up at 6:30ish as I requested. The food was hot and delicious! Their Peach Berry Iced Tea is to die for! The gentlemen who took my phone and assisted me was Anthony and he was so sweet and attentive. He let me know the kitchen was a little backed up and my food would be out shortly. He stepped out to hand me a drink as I waited. Thank you so much Anthony. Service like this is the reason why I will keep going back. :)
Mickolai B.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,97,10,2,4/9/2017,3.0,Service has really gone down. We got seated and the table floor was dirty and wasn't cleaned from the previous party. There were silverware utensils on the floor and the black napkins. When were seated  no utensils were provided to us even after appetizers were served.
Jerome P.,Long Beach  CA,0,1,2,6/25/2016,1.0,Service was great  our server Joel was nice.We came here to enjoy a nice early dinner  everything was great until my entree came out. Ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and after a few several bites I noticed something in my plate. I was hoping for the best  but it turned out to be a MASSIVE FLY and immediately my appetite was gone. When we brought the fly to our servers attention he immediately took the plate to the back and told the manager. When the manager came out she was understanding as we were both speechless  you hear about this type of incident happen but never experience it  unfortunately today this was the first time something like this happened to me. They told us they would bring us a new plate but I declined  my appetite was gone at this point  I was glad they were willing to comp the dinner  but still this was unacceptable.Although the service was good  I don't think we will be returning anytime soon because of this incident.
Elle C.,Santa Barbara  CA,137,17,4,10/20/2016,5.0,Steven the manager rocked the house! he turned a mediocre experience (busy night) into an AWESOME ONE!!! He made us feel like he cared about us with his genuine and thoughtful interactions. PS SKINNY RITAS ARE THE BEST
Sam M.,La Puente  CA,0,13,6,11/13/2016,5.0,Enjoying great pizza drinks and friends. Great service from all staff. My go to drink now on is a strawberry patch. The Bartender knows what he is doing.
Mary T.,Westminster  CA,1243,342,379,11/19/2015,3.0,Great service. Our server was really nice and patient throughout the entire time-- especially since my boyfriend was being so indecisive! She was super nice to have offered a sample of the beers that he wanted so he can make a decision. Points for that!! We came here for the late night happy hour  but I think they don't have as many food options on the happy hour menu here as other BJ's Restaurants do. There was the late night happy hour from 10pm-close  but I feel like the happy hour here is a tad bit more expensive than other places.I'm not sure I'd go here again for the happy hour  but service is good though!
Lauren V.,Tujunga  CA,108,104,106,2/11/2016,4.0,I came here with my sister and a couple friends after a long day and their food hit the spot! Our waiter was kind of slow but I totally understand because he was in training. (I worked in food service before so I know what it's like). Didn't really bother me. Another waitress was helping him out and the manager also helped us out. We started off with appetizers. I love the avocado egg rolls! But I think Cheesecake Factory's are better. Ours were a little undercooked because the egg roll wrapper was kind of chewy. But I didn't care cuz I was hungry. Then we got the Brussels sprouts with sriracha sauce. Oh. Em. Gee. This was probably the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had!!! Americas most hated vegetable-gotta try it! I love how crispy it was and the sauce-YUM! I also got an alcoholic drink. I think it was the strawberry patch? It's just spiked strawberry lemonade. A little strong if you don't like strong fruity drinks. My friend got the strawberry... Swirl? Strawberry splash? I think it was strawberry splash. It tastes and looks like a strawberry pina colada! I wish I would have gotten that instead. Oh well. Next time! Overall our experience here was great! :)
Anthony C.,Rosemead  CA,0,14,1,6/17/2017,1.0,So a coworker and I decided to eat here for a Friday for a late lunch at like 2ish on 6/16/17. We were immediately seated since there weren't much people there at the time. So It's the usual ask us what to drink and give us time to think what we wanted to eat. After we ordered our food it took a ridiculously long time to receive(we ordered salads) there is no reason for it to take as long as it did. After we got our food there was no settings for us so we sat around and try to flag someone down  but no one would pay attention to us at all. My coworker had to get up herself and walk over to the front and get settings for us to even eat our food. After we were finally ready to eat. They messed up on her order and put wasabi in it  which made it pretty unbearable for her to eat. While we were there the waitress never checked up on us and they never offered us the free apps that supposedly comes with our meal since we spent way more then enough money. Horrible location with horrible staff. If you can avoid coming to this location. You definitely should.
Dena W.,Hacienda Heights  CA,34,50,69,8/14/2017,3.0,Unfortunately  3rd time wasn't a charm. First two times  the service was very poor and I don't remember what I ate. I didn't want to go back  but my niece insisted that she loves BJs and they don't have one where she lives  so I gave it a 3rd try. Service was much better this time  but no wait on Saturday at 7pm and lots of empty tables was probably why. We ordered appetizers. They were pretty good. The burgers looked awesome! But I didn't order one! I Definitely like the spinach artichoke dip. One of our entrees preceded the 3rd appetizer. Waiter apologized for the error. Another server had brought it. I ordered the chicken with soba noodles. It didn't look anything like the photo. It was all noodles and the pieces of chicken were the size of cashews  not big chunks like the photo and only a few pieces of broccoli. The flavor was good. My hubby ordered a shrimp plate and the nice big shrimp in the photo were missing too. He pointed it out  so it's not just me. Restaurant was clean. Restroom was clean. If I get dragged back there again  I'll order a burger.
Hannah W.,Irvine  CA,72,42,23,12/28/2016,4.0,We just had lunch here with my bff and I think this is one of the better locations. She had the poke and I had the bison burger. Good was great and a nice way to spend a Wednesday afternoon lunch.
Rene M.,Newbury Park  Newbury Park  CA,0,2,,5/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Everything is going fine until we paid the check and we still stay at our table. I ask our waiter for a refill of my ice tea.... nothing. After a while  i couldn't find the waiter anymore so I ask this Asian waitress for a glass of ice water.... nothing. It seems like they start ignoring you as soon as you pay your check. I'm so disappointed and I'm not going back there anymore.We got there at 7:00 pm for dinner and the prime rib is gone.Time/date of visit: Thursday at about 7:00 pm.  4/27/13Thank you Steven for your response.
Katie B.,Pomona  CA,136,1,,11/18/2016,2.0,"I just had to leave a review after my visit here because I was so shocked by the service. My friend and I came in for a late night dessert (around 10:30) and the waiter was completely pleasant with us until he heard we only wanted pizookies and an appetizer. Once he heard that  he didn\'t so much as make eye contact with us the rest of the night and he was extremely rude. The tip of the iceberg was when he left the check he told us to let him know if we needed anything (even though his attitude showed he really didn\'t care) and my friend immediately said ""oh  excuse me  could we get a box  please?"" And he CONTINUED walking away without even acknowledging her request (mind you he stopped at the booth next to us and the restaurant WASN\'T even busy) and I was fine with it at first  because I thought he hadn\'t heard her  but when he came back with the check he had her box and it was clear he was just being a jerk.The only time he was even near cordial to us again was when he tried to make small talk as he handed us the check. Clearly he wanted a good tip even though I go above and beyond what he did for NOTHING extra at my job. The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because my food came out good. This server  who\'s name was Michael  completely ruined my experience."
Francis F.,West Covina  CA,81,68,33,1/27/2016,3.0,Parking: Big private lot  so it's not hard to park at all. It does tend to get a bit logjammed since it shares the same entrance as the Golden Corral next door.Place: Usually easy to find bar seating. Dining area is comfortable as well. TVs everywhere to watch whichever games are on that day. Bartenders are also really friendly.Price: Standard chain restaurant prices ($10-20  depending on what your order). Happy hour is the way to go with apps and pizza on the cheap. They also knock a buck off beers during HH.Pfood: Good food. Can't go wrong with a Great White pizza. I recently had a top sirloin (solid) and it came with a pretty dope Broccoli Cheddar soup and Caesar Salad. Pizzookies are the best here too. Salted Caramel is the way to go. As for beer  Jeremiah Red is a must. I'll be back again.
Nigina I.,Everett  MA,1,21,7,5/12/2016,1.0,First of all terrible staff!!!I work at the fast paced office environment  where every minute matters. My lunch is only 30 min  that's why I usually pre order my lunch online on Panera Breed's website. Yesterday I found out that BJs also has this option and decided to check it out. I preordered everything and showed up on the scheduled time. Even though Restaurant was empty I was sitting there for 20 min trying to get the attention of the waiters  finally somebody showed up and asked me to order  I had to repeat what I told the reception   it took another 20 min to wait there. So I had to leave without food since I was late !When I told the reception that I am leaving she looked at me bitchy. Terrible service !!! Terrible place
Alysia A.,Upland  CA,221,39,12,7/15/2016,5.0,First of all. My appetizer came out before my food...wtf is that about!?My beer was cold. Who'd a thunk it. I got a straw with my lemonade. ...that's racist.. Obviously.I'm kidding. Lawrence was awesome. Very attentive. Food was awesome. Service was amazing! We'll be back!!!!The only downfall was the little boy soliciting the patio tables asking for money from guests while the father (wearing a Best Dad Ever shirt) watched outside. This just happened while I'm writing this. ... Too bad the patio wall is small.
Kane C.,La Puente  CA,1,2,6,3/18/2017,5.0,Me and my wife had some wings and drinks. The root beer wings are delicious and the drinks were great. The waiter was very polite and nice. Very attentive  just wished I remembered his name. Hahaha
Robert R.,Walnut  CA,3,15,5,1/31/2017,4.0,Good stuff! My wife and myself like to come in on the weekday happy hours before the work rush comes in  the place is empty and you get decent attentiveness. For being happy hour it's still a bit pricey  but we can't get enough of the avocado rolls and calamari. The pizza is average  and the home brewed beers are alright too. But we do enjoy coming here.
Laurel F.,Madera  CA,0,3,,3/4/2017,1.0,"This was by far one of the worst dining experiences I\'ve ever had-the beer was warm and flat-no chilled glasses. I asked for a different beer-he accused me of drinking half and asking for another! He then asked if I was ""okay?""-not sure what he was implying. I was more than happy to pay for my warm beers! I never asked for ""free"" beer. This experience will go to the corporate office. Manager never stepped in. So much for customer service!BJ\'s never again! Waiter-Grayson."
Charlton C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,994,313,326,9/23/2014,4.0,"I have never actually dined in at this location before; I would always take it to go so I was excited to see how the experience was like. My friend and I decided to come here on a whim since everyone else was not as appealing to us. It was a Saturday night  it was quite busy but we noticed that there was nobody sitting in the outdoor area. We asked if we could go sit there because it was too cold inside and they accommodated us quickly. Too start off  I ordered a cocktail that was created at one of their other restaurants called ""A drink like that"" which consisted of Grey Goose Vodka  BACARDI 151  Rum  DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple  DeKuyper Pucker Island Blue  Sweet & Sour  Sierra Mist  and Grenadine. After perusing through the menu we decided to order the appetizer Avocado eggs rolls and a deep dish BBQ pizza to share.The eggs rolls came out quick and were very delicious. Nice and crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside as you would expect it. I can see myself just ordering this and be satisfied. The pizza was also delicious and very filling  we could not finish it. The server was very nice and friendly  though since we sat outside the service was kind of slow since there was no dedicated server to check up on us. Overall my experience was pleasant and I would come back again. I didn\'t get to try out the Pizookie sadly and that is on my list of what to order next time."
Adam M.,La Habra  CA,78,5,,3/17/2017,5.0,Was here with my GF and Jeffery was our waiter. We truly appreciated Jeffery's customer service. Thank BJ's for your bouzouki cookies!
Bruce M S.,Whittier  CA,1,7,2,3/26/2017,2.0,1st time eating here. Food was delicious! Good job to kitchen staff. Service was not good. Had to flag down staff for everything. Utensils  water refill  forgot my soup!! Because the food was so good I will try again and hopefully a more attentive staff will be working!!!
Zack R.,Corona Del Mar  CA,4,40,18,7/25/2016,5.0,"Stellar food  quick and friendly service  and a clean and huge restaurant with an outstanding ambience. It really doesn\'t get much better than this.I\'d recommend the root bear ribs or the deep dish ravioli. Both are exquisite. This place is better than most ""fancy"" restaurants I\'ve been to.20/10 would come back."
Ruby M.,La Puente  CA,0,6,3,2/17/2017,1.0,Worst damn service ever . How do the appetizers come after our plates . An hour late on the rest of our dishes ... we had to wave down a server. Horrible fuck this place
Jose L.,Rowland Heights  CA,1,6,20,10/31/2016,5.0,Avocado eggrolls!!!!! Been coming here for years. They changes the recipe of the eggrolls but there still the best around. Fish n chips are really good. Bbq chicken pizza is my favorite joshua took good care of us will be coming back real soon.
Andrew H.,South El Monte  CA,0,3,,2/8/2017,5.0,Went in a group of 4.Ordered: Best beginning app        chicken wings        large 5 meat pizza        the portobello burger        the pasta that was in a pan.Everything was good. We could've downsize the pizza to a medium and skip the pasta because we only took a bite each off of it.
Mia B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,6,,4/9/2016,2.0,Service was slow and horrible our waiter did not give us any utensils or plates even when the appetizers arrived ! He never asked if we are ok or if we needed anything & had to track him down to finally order   they have the right amount of waiters but in my opinion need to be trained more Food and beer was good but service was NOT
Curly C.,Baldwin Park  CA,60,69,120,12/14/2016,2.0,Honestly we waited to long to be helped. And I got sick off the food ! I'll stick to the west co location !
Larry T.,Covina  CA,73,86,1448,1/9/2016,2.0,I always don't like their food too saltyRegular service with lots of people....I just don't know why my mom always like to come over here Bad food ...... Oh my I wish you never going to come back again
Jennifer C.,Rowland Heights  CA,466,253,934,5/18/2015,3.0,I've come here a few times  I just think it's alright. Happy hour pricing is decent  but I think regular pricing is a bit steep. Food is decent and my favorite is their avocado rolls and pazookies!Drinks: Huge selection of beers and drinks but I wouldn't recommend coming here just to drink because it will add up and be pricey!The place is huge inside so it's great for large parties if you want to have a business lunch or bday dinner. Staff is nice and I really liked our waitress! She was really attentive to us and friendly. Wish I got her name. Private parking lot to park in. Overall  it's not a place I can come to eat/drink often only due to price. Maybe once a month..and I work and live close by!
LINDA N.,South Pasadena  CA,2,40,3,10/8/2016,5.0,This review is strictly for take out. We were first greeted by a lovely young lady Celeste. She was smiling as she took our order. She was kind and genuine. You can tell she really likes her job! I've been to other BJ's and this is now my favorite! Also  we took advantage of the $10 off $35 which you can also use for take out.They just changed their menu and pricing so it's a little bit more pricy.On to the food: Spicy chicken w soba noodles- Yumtastic!!Thyme Chicken w veggies- not badAvocado egg rolls- creamy Delish  the sauce is a bit sweet but it complements the dish well.As I waited she went above and beyond for a hungry pregnant woman. She gave me some fresh piping hot bread to nosh on while I waited for the food. I also received some water and lemon which was perfect. I love her!! Next time you feel like ordering in come and visit this BJ's and ask for Celeste. She will make your heart melt. What a sweetheart! It's nice to know there are still great people in the world.
Toke H.,Huntington Beach  CA,23,44,2,12/23/2016,2.0,Really disappointed in the service tonight. The wife and I wanted to have a nice holiday dinner...not happening. Ordered some appetizers and main course  was enjoying my draft beer then BAM! Our main course arrives...wait but what about our appetizers? Not feeling it  my wife was hungry so she started eating hers. I wasn't happy with it at all. They then bring the appetizers but I decline it because that's a backwards meal service in my book. Now  all I want to do is eat my meal and get out of there. Really disappointed. But hey they offered free desert  which we kindly declined. The 2nd star is for the food which was good but it should go hand in hand with your mood  how can you enjoy food when your not happy about the whole situation. I don't go out much but when I do  I expect better restaurant fundamentals.
Nicolas R.,Baldwin Park  CA,3,54,39,4/25/2016,3.0,Food was great. Service was bad. Took about 15 minutes to get our beverages. The server barley checked up on my girlfriend and I. Its a nice place.More working less talking with each other. They stay talking in a ball by the registers.
Bush L.,La Puente  CA,0,11,,1/22/2017,5.0,This place is awesome  its always packed n the seating wait is long but the service and food is great!! The servers come often and are very attentive to you!!!
David V.,Rowland Heights  CA,542,28,20,11/2/2016,5.0,Brian and Angie are the absolute best bartenders. My wife and I always receive great service from them. They're personable  attentive and professional! Next time you're in the area  hit up the bar here. Ask for Brian or Angie and you'll be guaranteed some awesome service.
Yohan S.,Whittier  CA,0,24,,6/26/2017,2.0,Popular and reliably mediocre food like McD. Had small deep dish pizza; way too salty for entree. Better as reason to drink more beer than choice for dinner. Their clam chowder in bread bowl is really not worth ordering. Better to stick with beer and pizookies.
Chloe W.,El Monte  CA,211,137,138,3/31/2016,3.0,I thought BJ's is just okay. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't SOOO great. We got the Deep Dish BBQ Chicken and Fish & Chips  which was good. I really love the fries. The only complaint is that I wish their food was a little hotter  when our food came out it was just warm. The service was alright. Overall  the food is just okay while the prices are pretty high.
Arlene L.,Rowland Heights  CA,5,22,7,3/15/2016,1.0,Just ordered Santa Fe egg rolls to go curb side and I'm very disappointed. The egg told are soft and wet from the garnish tomato and onions they put in the middle. I would think they know that it will get soggy if it stay more than a couple of minutes on top of the egg rolls. I'm no chef but I know that. I've ordered to go at different restaurants and they put things in the side to keep the dish at least presentable and not taong gross . Big franchise should have good training on these kind of stuff.
Audra R.,La Habra  CA,0,6,,8/28/2016,1.0,"Seated and ignored for 10 minutes! Got up and left. On our way out mentioned it to hostess and her response was ""Oh okay - Thank you"". No I\'m sorry- let me get the manager...nothing. Server walked by several times not making eye contact  or acknowledging our existence with a "" be right back"" or anything. My husband wanted to yell at someone but we needed to get home to our kids..... This place is slower than heck during lunch...thought they would be better prepared for dinner......WRONG!"
Vibiana R.,Mira Loma  CA,1,9,,11/26/2016,1.0,Went in today with a party of 6 and it was empty took them 15 minutes to seat us.  When they finally came and took our order it took forever for it to come out. Most places give the children their food first not here!!! They brought out all the food except for you daughters which was clam.chowder on a sourdough bread bowl. Took them about 10 minutes to come over and ask how we were. When I reminded them about her order it took another 10 minutes to come out. Needless p say my food was cold but them but I wasn't going to eat in front mf my daughter while she waited for her order. I think our server completely forgot about her order No apologies or anything!!
cheska s.,San Diego  CA,0,3,1,5/9/2017,1.0,"My fianc and I came in on a Monday night after I got off from work and we got the appetizer sampler and ordered Parmesan garlic wings with it. Upon our orders arrival  we noticed the wings were buffalo flavored and immediately told the server who brought it to us who said ""oh yeah  you ordered the garlic Parmesan!"" So he knew there was a mistake. He apologized and took it back  only to bring the SAME buffalo wings  mixed with a tiny bit of the garlic Parmesan sauce  which was GARBAGE. They probably thought we wouldn\'t notice  but we did  and it was gross. You could totally taste both flavors and it wasn\'t good at all. We notified our actual server who then apologized and said they\'d make a new batch  and thanked him. The guy who brought out our new wings was the same guy who brought out the disgusting buffalo-Parmesan garlic wings and looked PISSED OFF coming back to us and just dropped off the plate at the end of our table without a single word. Step it up  BJs. It was 10:30pm on a Monday night  you ain\'t busy so there\'s no excuse. After a long day of work  I just wanted to eat and go home  so it was frustrating to have them make a mistake  then wait for it to be fixed. Only for them to half ass ""fixing"" their mistake and having to wait allllll over again. After all the waiting we had to do  we still had to pay full price for LOUSY kitchen service. Our actual server wasnt bad at all  given that it appeared he was working the bar area by himself. But unfortunately  this was not a pleasant experience and we probably won\'t be coming back here anymore."
Johnson K.,West Covina  CA,77,313,170,1/15/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Wow.. What happened BJ's Puente Hills? This location had always been my preferred location despite the fact that I am located right in between two of them. Tonight's service by Shane was probably one of the worse I've experienced. First of all  the ribeyes we ordered were overcooked. Second  we were rarely checked on (our waters were empty for at least 15 mins before we were finally able to wave him down for refills). Finally  it must have took at least half an hour for the moment we flagged him down for the check to finally getting my signature signed on the line. Disappointing!I probably will give this place one more try for the benefit of my doubt before I officially take my business to BJ's West Covina!
Donna C.,Los Angeles  CA,228,417,505,2/25/2015,4.0,"This place is known for their pizza and beer. I loved getting the hand tossed pizza. When the pizza comes to your table  the cheese is all melted  gooey  and just plain perfection. You have to eat it quick too while the pizza is nice and hot. Yuuuup!! It\'s THAT gooood... BUT they took it off the menu so you\'re out of luck. Are you crying a little inside? Yeah..me too...me toooThe second best choice is the deep dish pizza. I always get bjs favorite. It\'s a fav for a reason! Not as good as the hand tossed but it will do. The avocado egg rolls on this visit were gross. It tasted old. Calamari was dry. Ahi tuna salad also tasted too fishy and old. These were the ""not getting ever again"" items. These were staples in the past but because of this one bad experience  I won\'t be ordering them again.Chicken wings...i dont think you can mess this up..these were delicious as usual. Pizooki - this is a baked cookie with ice cream on top. One of the best creations ever. This should be devoured first so there\'s always room for dessert. :) I like the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream."
Sheila N.,Temple City  CA,55,2,,6/17/2016,1.0,If I could give zero stars  this review would receive zero stars!! I booked an event here with 45 guests recently. The contract stated that alcohol war NOT included in the package. At the end of the night why was I given an alcohol bill of $300 dollars?!?!?! I had no choice but to pay it at that time as half the guests were already gone. The next day I spoke with the manager Steven who indicated that he would call me back in 2 days so that he could speak with the GM Debbie in order to come up with a solution. I had to call him back and his solution was to blame me for paying the bill!! Really??? Such poor customer service. Even the GM was suppose to call me back but nothing!! I will NEVER eat here and I will be telling ALL my friends and family to NEVER book an event here again!!
Anthony R.,Los Angeles  CA,133,19,16,10/1/2016,1.0,Absolutely horrible service never coming here again. We had a large party. And we had 3 servers who obviously did not communicate with each other. One of our tables got drinks with all their food. While the others got half their drinks. They messed up our orders. We got our desert before our salad and got our specialty drinks when we were almost done with our meals. Our server rarely came and checked on us. Absolutely horrible. The manager did comp us some food. But after everything it was not worth it. I know it was a big party bit thats no excuse. Will never come here again.
Small S.,Rowland Heights  CA,7,6,,10/11/2016,5.0,Good staff great service. Beer is the best. Nice place to dine or grab a drink. Highly recommended... And also they found my phone and gave back to me.
Cinde Q.,Pico Rivera  CA,0,5,3,10/29/2016,1.0,Bad service from the waitresses and management. Everyone here is beyond rude. No customer service experience. Not sure why anything hasn't been done after reading ALL the bad reviews for the customer service and wait times. I love BJs but AVOID this location!!!!
Ana R.,La Puente  CA,0,8,4,11/9/2016,2.0,We have been to this place about 15 times this year. It seems it gets worse every time. I used to like their pizzas  salads and appetizers. But it gets worse every time. Every time we wait longer and longer. This last time we waited for 35 minutes for our meals to arrive  my son fell asleep. Service wasn't bad this las time but the guys usually seem too busy. My steak was supposed to be cooked medium-well and it was burned in the outside and totally cooked in the inside. Our abocado in the bacon-avocado burger seemed old. Definitely not going back there. Attaching pictures...
Desiree L.,Chino Hills  CA,7,79,48,3/25/2017,1.0,Thursday night I went to this location and it started out fine. But as the night went on and more people came to join us for our going away get together for a great friend and coworker things started to deteriorate. We asked to have separate checks and for the first couple hours it was fine  then when our server was off  they could no longer give us separate checks. One of our party waited 30 minutes for his drink  another was closed out then told they didn't pay and another was over charged 3 extra beers. Maybe your staff should be trained a little more or get more staff. Better yet we were told that we would either have to move inside if we could find tables or if we stay out side we would not be served because no one on the wait staff wanted to serve us. No one wanted to serve us I asked again to be clear and was told twice yes that is correct. If we were to be served at all then whatever tabs we had at the bar would be combined and we would no longer be able to pay separately. When some of my party who had tabs went to pay their bills  found that the bill had already combined and when the paid it remained on the combined bill. So  now your telling me that your computer system can't handle subtracting a payment or is it your wait staff that can't? This coming from a manager also stating that his server was doing us a favor by giving us separate checks in the first place????? WTF!!!!!! If you don't want to serve paying customers on the patio after a certain hour  then don't offer to seat them at the patio. Seriously  if your under staffed say so.... we would have understood. We work in retail we understand being busy and understaffed. I would suggest if your mgt is going to flat out lie to a customer come up with something better than our servers don't want to serve your party because it's too big. What a way to not get repeat business or a good tip. Doesn't you staff survive on their tips. I will no longer patron this location again that is for sure.
Eduardo B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,14,,1/28/2016,2.0,"The waiters are usually pretty impersonal-able but the food is usually good. I say usually because I had the worst dish I\'ve ever had at a restaurant the last time I visited bjs. Do not have the deep dish ziti it was so small and had very little pasta. It was more like a tomato soup with some nasty ""cheese"" thing that was more like a cream. It was 10 noodles swimming in a orange mess."
Gigi g.,Los Angeles  CA,185,59,26,3/11/2017,1.0,I hate writing a bad review.  This is about front of the house.. I don't know where to start. Maybe when I walk in and hostess has her back against the host stand having a conversation with a coworker. Then we made eye contact only to finish the conversation. I walked to the bar area with my adult daughters. Note we are all in the food industry and we know how corporate restaurant are run. I know that BJ have a standard of service. Saw nothing. We didnt receive roll ups! We were using the bar nap for our drinks. WtF! Or sever did not want to be there but talk to his friends at a different table. I didn't see a manager in site. No one touching tables let alone my server. What's going on here. I can here for great service but it was horrible tonight. On a side note..Props to the kitchen. Bravo Pizza was on point and ticket times. Runners ran food with acknowledgment and she refresh our table with plates and sliver.
Yuka N.,Brea  CA,314,440,1691,11/20/2013,3.0,Parking: bad & smallInterior: dimly lit but nice atmosphereService: ok... Few exceptions of couple of friendly serversBar area: bartenders r pretty coolFood: depends on wut u order... Can't go wrong w the deep dish pizza & pizookieDrinks: beer!!!Happy hour: best time 2 comeRestrooms: don't know  never used it
Christy M.,San Gabriel  CA,1008,353,4245,3/30/2014,5.0,My boyfriend and I came here on a late Sunday night because we were both hungry and wanted something different from what we would normally eat. We waited in the front for a few minutes until someone finally tended to us and seated us. Kayla was our server for the night and she was amazing. I've been to BJ's a few times before at different locations  and I've received good and bad service. But Kayla was refreshing to have; she was very sweet and attentive to us. She gave us recommendations  and told us about the specials the restaurant was having. My boyfriend decided on getting:Ahi Poke appetizer - $10.25Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza - $15.25Seared Ahi Salad - $14.95No joke  our meal was huge. I really love how decadent and comforting their pizza is  so I only order pizza whenever I come here. I ordered the small so I could bring back left overs for my brother to eat  and have some for lunch the next day. My boyfriend has been hooked on Ahi Tuna for the past few months  so that's a perk for me too since I also like Tuna. The Ahi Poke ($10.25) was good; poke tasted freshly tossed and didn't seem like it was sitting in the marinade for too long. The avocado chunks were huge  and they were the big haas avocados  so they tastes very rich and a perfect balance to the smooth texture of the tuna. It wasn't any special sashimi grade  considering that it's BJ's  but it was good. It was a pretty good portion of tuna  and it came with a side of 8 won ton chips. The Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza ($15.25) was pretty good. I usually just get the combo  but the garlic was definitely savory. I was just expecting garlic seasoning on the pizza  but I saw some chunks integrated into the alfredo sauce in the pizza  so that was awesome. The toppings to pizza dough ratio wasn't well balanced in my personal opinion  but because the crust was sooo unbelievably buttery and flakey  I won't complain. I got more full from the dough itself than the overall meal. I ate about 2 slices and got full. My boyfriend really liked their alfredo sauce  so another perk!The Seared Ahi Salad ($14.95) was such a huge portion! It looked as if it as easily 2 salads in one. Personally  I'm too cheap to be spending $15 on a salad from BJ's  at that rate I would have just ordered a pizza. The seared ahi was just okay in my opinion. The texture itself was a bit mushy  so it wasn't as fresh as the poke earlier  but the overall dish was good. The dressing was delicious  however the salad itself was overdressed. The avocados  greens  and overall flavors were very generous and my boyfriend and I thought we could've just shared the salad and an appetizer and we would have been full already!We also signed up for their rewards programs  and I guess once you sign up it includes a free pizookie? This was actually the first time I went to BJ's and didn't get a pizookie because we were so full from the salad! I guess we'll save the freebie for another time :)Overall  we both had a great time at Bj's  and we left with way more food than we intended to. Kayla  you were great! She made us feel very welcomed  and our glasses were never left half empty. We will definitely be back at this location.
Rachel M.,Rosemead  CA,59,16,7,6/3/2016,1.0,DISSATISFIED! Should have checked yelp first. Reviews were spot on. Arrived at 11:45 am. Seated very quickly. Server finally got to us at 12:10 appetizers got to us before the fountain drinks. Took 40 minutes to get food with half of it only arriving after I called the manager. Never received my grandson's rice and manager never came back to see if everything was taken care of. Eventually leaving the restaurant at 2:30! Be warned  make sure you are willing to spend 2hrs and 40mins for lunch and not receive a correct order.
Chloe H.,Diamond Bar  CA,51,11,6,5/26/2016,1.0,Crappy humans  bad service  rude to Asians. Seated people with more people than my group. Never coming back. Probably going to starve myself before I come here again. Ever. Do not come here I hope they get out of business. They make a really bad first impression.
Fred F.,La Verne  CA,0,10,1,3/28/2017,5.0,We love coming here and Krystal the manager is great. She was very accomodating and always has a smile. Service is great. I have been to several other BJ'S but this place in Industry is by far the best.
Gloria C.,Irvine  CA,596,563,572,10/1/2014,1.0,I've been to this BJ's many times and like many of the other BJ's out there  it's a well oiled machine. Standard decor  standard menu  standard food and standard service. I love the pizookie's here  love their enLIGHTened menu items such as the mahi mahi with rice  and adore their kale and brussel sprouts salad. I've had great servers  but also not so great  it just depends on the day. Came here this past weekend and I stupidly left my wallet on the table. I discovered this a few hours later  had a moment of intense panic when I looked in my purse and it wasn't there  and was so so relieved when I called BJ's and found out they had it. Only sad thing is I had about $80 in cash in my wallet INCLUDING a sentimental $2 bill a deceased family member had given to me  and it was gone when they returned my wallet back to me. I don't care so much about the $80  but did they really have to take the $2 too? It was tucked away in a different pocket of my multi-compartmental Kate Spade wallet so it was obvious someone had taken the time to sift through the contents of my wallet.While I appreciate that my server found my wallet  and saved me the hassle of getting new credit cards and driver licenses  to take a personal stand  I will never come back to this BJ's again.
Brizylla A.,Irvine  CA,2253,198,348,7/23/2013,3.0,I came here to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends and I was discouraged afterwards. The food isn't as great as everyone says because it really depends on what you order. The menu has a large selection with many choices of meals and drinks. If you get a pizza the portions are big obviously. However  my friend had a pork sandwich; the portion was small and we also saw it was a little raw. My other friend had a pasta and it was tiny but she said it tasted great. Attention from the server wasn't the best and she only came to us twice. It's as if we didn't exist.I do recommend going here if you want a FREE pizookie on your birthday. It's the only perks of it. Other than that  I would suggest going somewhere with better prices and bigger portions like Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory.
Leslie M.,Homeland  CA,0,3,,10/2/2016,1.0,Bjs is my favorite restaurant I go at least 3 times a month.It wasn't a very busy Saturday night there was no reason for the food to have taken as long as it did and when it did come out one plate had hair. The service wasn't bad but I've never had bad service at a BJs. This BjS needs some improvement. They didn't even add my points to my reward card and we had to pay for the hairy plate...
Reyna M.,West Covina  CA,135,11,1,9/25/2016,1.0,Got my order wrong. After they fixed it  I only got my food after my date was done eating  so I took it to go. Pizza was undercooked and 99% bread with hardly any cheese or toppings. Bummer
Cherrie W.,Westchester / LAX  Los Angeles  CA,0,13,5,6/21/2016,1.0,Worst place ever. During a busy lunch hour  we had to wait an hour an half for our food. We ended up having it to go because it was past our lunch break. We saw so many people who came after us got their food  which was the same food. I don't want to point out names but Michelle was our server. She gave us attitude and just gave us excuses of why our food wasn't coming. I am never coming back again
May L.,Pasadena  CA,36,91,14,12/22/2015,1.0,"My first server stepped out of the segregated south and treated us like second-class citizens. It wasn\'t busy and waiting ten minutes to be acknowledged seemed like an eternity. When he finally came to our table  he glared (yes! Death stare style) at us  without any glimmer of smile  introductions  apology for the delay and took our order in the most condescending tone. If we were out on the streets  a beat down would\'ve ensued. That\'s the vibe we got at our table. Scary! Management finally sent me a new server. She was friendly but her runner nearly threw our plates down. Wow! Their tantrums are far better than my kids\' soap opera rage. Five stars for novella-show quality attitudes...In the service industry  it\'s an epic fail! Management didn\'t offer any concessions when the bill came. Even complimentary iced teas on a $100 bill for lunch would\'ve shown good faith. Service should\'ve been done right the first time. Considering the surreal nature of the poor service  it\'s a negative 5 stars. Manager switched our server  who turns out friendly. 4 stars. Average the two: 1 star Although smart establishments would go out of their way to ""take care"" of their customers  lack of concessions are not within norm of any dining experience. If it is part of a restaurant grade  this review would downgrade to a negative star rating.The food was mediocre  at best. My favorite item is discontinued: basil tomato pasta. The calamari was skimpy and the rib eye was charred on the outside. Real chefs know the difference between burning the outside of a steak versus properly searing it. You can tell it didn\'t rest in room temperature and was thrown on the grill half frozen. The rice pilaf was still hard and 1/2 cooked. My soup arrived lukewarm. The burgers were haphazardly stacked together and the patty was not seasoned at all. That\'s a sign of complacent standards in the kitchen. Taste in my mouth: meh"
Roman A.,Montclair  CA,39,44,18,5/11/2016,2.0,"Went in for late dinner  self seating in the bar area cause the rest of the restaurant is closed. Funny go in at 10:55pm and they they close at 12:00am and the regular seating is ""closed"". So it\'s self seating and first come first serve. I walk up to a table (booth) that just was finished being cleaned and the little host girl tells me that it is for other guests  I look at her and say first come? She tells me that they were waiting for that booth. They were sitting at a high table eating all ready. Poor decision to close the rest of the restaurant. We left and will not return."
Jennifer A.,Walnut  CA,9,147,441,11/4/2015,1.0,Came in for HH & was pretty empty around 6:15 pm on a week night. Sat down & waitress basically threw menu's on table without saying a word. Ok  that's fine  maybe she's having a bad day  whatever. Wing's  Calamari  Chips & Queso were all average. Deep dish pizza is always good. Came time to pay & I showed the $10 off $35 email coupon BJ's keeps spamming my email with and I was told  I couldn't use it because our tab was all HH items. Hmmm...really ? I've used these type of deals before on HH so either I got lucky (all the time) or she was just Sh*tting me. Fine print stated nothing about HH food  alcohol yes  but ok  unsubcribing and would rather eat Costco food court dinner next time. Much more friendlier there !
M K.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,4,,9/1/2016,1.0,Very poor service  we left Chilly from having a bad experience  but this location isn't any better. The manager working eating at one of the tables  she made a few passes in front of us  we did make eye contact but no greet from the manager  knowing we are looking for our waiter.... We been here a few times in the past  service before has always been pretty good for us. We final ask the manager to assist  she bring us the bill  and goes back to her table to do work and eat  again no waiter or waitress to be seen for well over 15 mins.Manager needs to be coached and re-focus  set the example for the staff on the floor. Majority of the waiter and waitress are in the back  and there are very little customers in the building. The host was great  she very happy jolly personality  also the bar tender seems to be pretty active  otherwise everyone hanging out in the back.Poor service will result unwanted customers wanting to return.
Connie Z.,Rowland Heights  CA,365,14,13,10/18/2014,1.0,"First I have to say this place\'s food is delicious. The reason I give it a 1 star though is for the service. HORRIBLE  RACIST  NEGLECTEDI walked in seeing the receptionist giving me the ""whatever"" attitude then my waitress waited me very VERY impatiently. I felt like I was being questioned as a suspect. I ordered their wonderful dessert thinking it would come last cause it\'s common sense  right? But it came before everything else and I asked to put it last. Guess what? My waitress swoops in arguing and questioning me  somewhat forcing me to either have the dessert or get charged double to make a fresh one. Then she gave me the ""sucks to suck"" attitude. My question is what did I ever do to her to deserve this?!I\'m just trying to celebrate and now I feel like I\'m in prison. Thanks BJ\'s.Tip for you waiters in BJ\'s: YOU DO NOT TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT TO DO."
Nicole Q.,Long Beach  CA,266,473,370,9/8/2014,4.0,Because I attempt to avoid chain restaurants on a whole  my rating may be somewhat biased. This is a place my dad likes and the only time I've been is when my dad and grandma want to eat out. Generally-speaking  the service is pretty good. The food is ok.The Scallop entree  even with no sauces and no butter whatsoever was pretty good. For me  the downside is a huge restaurant filled with people  loads of kids and huge families  which can translate into a loud and chaotic-feeling dining experience. As I said  my review is probably a little biased by my dislike of chain restaurants  which usually are more concerned with packing people in than intimacy.
E S.,Whittier  CA,1,77,,2/21/2017,4.0,We had a party of 20 people and I had to make my reservations the same day. They gave me the run around over the phone. After speaking with the manager we finally worked it out. It was on a weekday so I do not believe they were very busy. Once we arrived they seated us quickly. Took our orders quickly and were very pleasant. I am giving four stars only because the food came out sooo slowly! Once it did arrive everyone seemed happy with their orders. Another plus  they allowed us separate checks. That made it so much easier. I will go back eventually but not going to rush my return.
Hilda Q.,Pico Rivera  CA,1,6,3,9/18/2016,5.0,Good service and good atmosphere I really loved the fried calamari and the artichoke and spinach dip I'll defenitly be coming back for more
Lucy S.,La Puente  CA,4,6,,2/20/2016,4.0,Came Friday night and we got seated right away. Atmosphere was chill and this place looks really nice inside. Service was on point. He came often to see if we needed anything. I ordered the Ziti wich is new on the menu. I would come here again! Not sure what all the negative comments are about but this place had better service then some spots around that area.
Kelvin R.,Anaheim  CA,43,24,20,9/13/2015,4.0,I came in tonight with my girlfriend for dinner. Was seated and when our server( Kailia I belive this was her name) she came up to our table and introduce herself and before anything else she looked at me and thanked me for my military service.  I got to say it was one of the nicest and most sincere thanks I've heard in a long while. I almost choked up because of how she said it.  She told me that her father was in the Army and that she has so much respect for the veterans. ... I want management to thank her for making my dinner experience spot on.
Grace C.,San Diego  CA,66,194,272,11/22/2015,2.0,Chain restaurants are great sometimes. You know what to expect when you walk in - no surprises with food quality or service. And this BJ's offered just that. I was able to get a table easily during dinner time on a Sunday night while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. Our server seemed a bit annoyed with us because she had to come back twice to get our order (first time we weren't ready  then there was about 10-15min wait time before she came back). Attitude was lukewarm and deadpan the entire time. Oh well. Food was decent - I ordered lemon chicken and there was way too much lemon over my meat  and my dish was incredibly salty. Their in-house root beer was rather flat and soft  so root beer lovers beware!Eh  it's not like I'll never go back to a BJs  but like I said  you kind of know the mediocrity you get yourself into when you step indoors.
Jessica A.,Azusa  CA,0,32,17,8/20/2016,5.0,Great place. I got signed up for a rewards with Carla. Honestly she was an amazing waitress  made sure our drinks were full and made sure we had the best service. A week ago we were there and we had a rude waitress  but Carla changed our minds to keep coming back to this location. Super polite and nice.
Grace C.,Anaheim  CA,51,829,812,11/20/2014,4.0,Been to a good number of BJ's. All have been fairly consistent  and this City of Industry one is no exception. Came over here because our strict diet means we need a restaurant where they have a very broad selection of menu items that we can choose from. I ordered a salad  while the hubby got a burger. Both very good  both very savory.Service was very good. Had no issues  as our server had a LOT of tables he was dealing with. Yet he was able to get to us in a fairly timely manner considering he was having his hands full. It was a very busy Sunday  so we weren't surprised on the wait times. May be back. Good number of restaurants in the Puente Hills area  and this will be a possible option for us if we're in the area. Their loyalty program seems interesting. Already signed up  but we'll see how it turns out.
Buzzin Around Town I.,Fontana  CA,0,40,45,7/29/2016,1.0,AWFUL SERVICE- NOT EVEN DESERVING OF A STAR!!! Lunch service is extremely slow and unhelpful! Waitress had an attitude and the manager Kayla was not helpful to accommodate picking up the slack for Michelle H. took over 45min to get salads to the table before our entree! Spoke to manager to help and took an additional 15 min to bring boxed entree. Tickets would not be accommodated since Kayla complained we were an error/hassle for their system for ORDERING FOOD AHEAD to avoid being delayed! STAY AWAY
Michael F.,Covina  CA,187,22,8,8/9/2016,1.0,The food was mediocre. The service was not great. Drinks were only refilled once and our server would disappear. It's also kind of sad when a business encourages being able to pay through an app to avoid the wait to pay.
Eileen H.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,3,1,2/19/2017,1.0,Was overcharged three times the amount of my original bill and managers answer for this is oh just wait 3 days and you'll get credited this happens all the time I waited more than three days called it in again and they told me to wait another 3 days for a return for their mistake like I was the one doing something wrong! Never returning to this bjs ever! customer service sucks
Andrea P.,Brea  CA,120,31,,7/10/2016,1.0,This place took a ridiculous amount of time. Our first server took so long just to take our water order and the second server would NEVER check on us. The food was taking an extremely long time and he would walk by so quickly or just not look our way to not deal with us. I am not exaggerating when I say I was here for almost 3 hours just to eat lunch. They should never take this long and I will never be back at this BJs and will warn friends and family before they come here too.
Shadi B.,La Puente  CA,0,9,3,5/3/2016,1.0,This BJ's location is one of the worst locations I've ever been to. The employees are extremely rude and inconsiderate of others. It always takes forever to receive my order and when I need something on the side or a refill on my drink I have to wait forever. Regardless if the place is busy or not it still takes forever. Also  I always hear the employees complaining about their job in front of customers. Who ever the manager is needs to really look into who they are hiring because the staff is AWFUL. BUT  the dishes are ALWAYS clean. So gold stars for the dish line! Everyone else.... No comment.
Monica M.,Pomona  CA,0,4,,8/4/2016,1.0,Come here maybe once every 2 months mainly for the food because I've had more bad than good experiences with the service . I'm a server so I know how things go but Lawrence and Marvin are horrible servers. Both were rude and lacked attentiveness.
Liz C.,Santa Clara  CA,380,495,2284,9/12/2013,5.0,"Came here for a late night dinner. It closes at midnight on Thursday. The server and waiters are all very nice and friendly. The place is dim and has lots of choices on the menu. I like how they have a ""light"" section for those who are watching their calories.I got the salmon from the light section. It tasted great and also had perfectly cooked couscous. My boyfriend got spaghetti and meatballs and he thought it tasted great. Overall  great place and if you want a sweet dessert  definitely go for the pizookies!"
Tiffany M.,Simi Valley  CA,0,37,2,10/20/2016,5.0,Visited on a Thursday night. The baseball game was on and the restaurant was busy and short staffed. Steven the manager came through and was helping deliver food and take drink orders. He showed that he truly cares about his patrons.
Willy M.,Seattle  WA,370,727,1459,10/15/2014,3.0,Was in town for work and my coworker has never been and he isnt too adventurous of an eater so we decided that this would fit him with some bar food  burgers  beers and it would be safe bet since its a chain type place. Nice looking place  a lot of tables  huge screens to watch sports on and nice environment. We actually came here twice during our work visit to the area. From those days we ordered burgers (black & bleu  BJ smokehouse  cheese burger) pizzas  fish tacos and some stuffed mushroom apps. Burgers were cooked decently but nothing to send back  pizza looked tasty and no complaints there. Fish tacos was seasoned nicely too. I like that you can choose from thin cut fries or potato wedges ( we call them JoJo's in Seattle area). A few recommended beers and we were good to go! Service is fine  I can tell they were a little stressed out since I think the amount of staff is limited and they have a lot of tables to cover. We didnt have any issues the 2 nights we went there. A pretty decent place despite some of the other review  our wallets weren't stolen  I kind of hoped my rental car would've been so I can get a new rental because that was a piece of crap! (unrelated rant)Happy BJ'n!!!
Chris Z.,La Puente  CA,0,22,,8/13/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"This one star rating is not a reflection of the food or our server but the staff we encountered AFTER the meal. After leaving this location it was discovered a set of keys were left behind by my mother. She had taken them out of her purse and set them on the seat to put on her glasses and forgot to pick them up. So I drove back and went to up to the three hostesses and explained I had just dined there about 20 minutes ago and keys were left behind. I pointed out the booth and asked if they could look as it was now occupied. The hostess left and returned about 5-10 minutes later and said ""no one found the keys .. leave your name and number"". I asked once again if they could simply look on the floor of the booth. She simply repeated to leave my name and number. No one would simply take a moment to look under the table !! disgusted I left doubt I will visit this location again. Called and asked for a manager - someone named Crystal gave me the usual "" we will talk to them about this"" brush off."
Kevin C.,Rowland Heights  CA,26,3,12,7/8/2015,3.0,I give three stars only because the food was ok tonight!!!!!!!Where all the serivcer????????????I put up my hand for 30secs the serivcer didn't come the hostess came.....I mean u guys talk to each other doesn't bring u guys more tips!!!!!!
Steve F.,San Diego  CA,914,1163,5927,2/19/2013,2.0,"Over the weekend  I had told my girlfriend about Golden Corral. But  after seeing the line there go out the door and around the parking lot  we decided to try BJ\'s nearby. And apparently we weren\'t the only ones - we noticed a steady stream of customers coming in after us.The first sign that we may have made a bad call was when we gave our name to the servers for a 10-minute wait... and after seeing everyone else\'s names called that were after us  we asked to see if we\'d been skipped. Their response: ""Oh  we called your name sometime ago."" Um  we were in the lobby next to the desk - we WOULD have heard it.The second bad sign was with my order. While Kathy\'s California Burger and my Jalapeno Burger turned out ok (along with the fried artichoke hearts)  I had asked for the skinny fries - and I got the potato wedges instead. Don\'t get me wrong - the burgers were very filling (if not overpriced). But while your orders come out quickly  the service at BJs leaves much to be desired. In fact  one could say that we didn\'t get a happy ending from this BJ\'s!"
Lily L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,2,,7/24/2016,2.0,The food was not great. The service was worse.The waiter was helpful when we walk in but he disappeared and another waiter gave us the bill but it was the wrong bill. This is the second time we had poor service and for sure not coming back to this place.
Ter R.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,10,,6/28/2015,1.0,Garbage service. We didn't even stay for the food.  In fact we never saw a waiter/waitress the entire time we waited to be attended to.  Came in on a Sunday right before noon.  Sat down and watched as people who had arrived after us placed their orders in a decent amount of time.  Walked up and let the hostess know we had been waiting for someone to come take our order for over 20 minutes.  She just looked at me and said she was sorry as we walked out. This place can take its SORRY and shove it.
Anthony P.,Brea  CA,20,280,233,9/6/2015,4.0,I come here for the pizzookie: an outrageous dessert of a large  warm cookie (chocolate chip  my fav) and vanilla ice cream. Don't get me wrong  there are other good combinations of cookies and ice cream  but this one is my favorite. As a brew house  they have good sampler sets and the appetizers are filling. For this review  it was all about the pizzookie...
CeeJay B.,Diamond Bar  CA,15,28,6,10/24/2014,3.0,This location is not to far from the office  and the online ordering makes it a lot easier. Reason I have it three stars:-1 star: I ordered a medium burger and received a well done  charred and burnt tasting burger-1 star: an item I ordered was incomplete  missing their sauce. Not to mention  it was very messy like they were in a rushHowever  I appreciate how the manger  Melissa  who handled the situation. I came back to work to discover my over cooked order and called them right away. She was very nice and respectful and was able to accommodate a refund my mailing a Gift card back since i could not return back to the restaurant.
Matthew z.,Diamond Bar  CA,314,143,41,10/3/2015,3.0,Consistent with a corporate chain trying to increase prices to increase margins. Don't expect anything special just mehhhhh. Passing time while I go to a wedding ceremony. Appetizers are alright but they have beer so that's all gravy!
Reezs B.,Rowland Heights  CA,35,3,4,6/23/2015,1.0,"There\'s really no need to write a review about the food at this place. I\'m only writing this review because the service here is terrible. Came here and got attitude from the host and the other host who walked us to our table. The girl slammed the menu and the seats. We hoped to get a more decent service from our server  but he was just as bad. Very rude to our party and did not have a smile on his face until he realized he knew one of the guys in our party. That didn\'t change his service though. He said something like  ""yeah I\'m here to serve you but ask me a question and I\'ll tell you straight up!"" in such a rude way. We didn\'t bother to even ask for a manager because we figured management is probably just as bad if the whole crew is bad so we just left."
Zahra B.,Los Angeles  CA,87,35,32,7/6/2014,4.0,Its my third time experience BJ's restaurant. I always come here when I am on my way to Vegas. I always order crispy fried artichokes and spinach Stuffed Mushroom for appetizer which is great. Today I order Lemon Thyme Chicken lunch portion. It was perfect. Herb-roasted chicken breast over brown rice in lemon thyme sauce. I LOVE IT !Service is very good today :)
Nicolas S.,Rowland Heights  CA,72,41,37,11/1/2014,3.0,Our waiter was very nice especially on a weekday at the end of the day. I ordered the classic rib eye and it was delicious! Our waiter did seem tired but he still tried his best to be nice to us. The food is great but service could use a bit more help to perfect things. I don't care how fast my food gets to my table but I do care about how nice my waiter is.Overall I've heard mixed things about this place but one reoccurring thing is the service.
Felicia M.,Hacienda Heights  CA,598,261,793,2/9/2014,4.0,This is my go to place for happy hour drinks and snacks. I have to say  when it was first built it was not that good. Once they got their stoves broken and and left over grease on the pans it was much better. I am going to review on the happy hour experience that I often have here at BJs. It is from 3-7 and 10 to close Sunday through Thursday. The bar area is good size so I never have problems finding a seat. The staff is always nice but changes throughout your meal for some reason so you may have more that one server. Now for the good part  the food and drink. I have had chicken club flatbread  bruschetta  sliders  spinach dip and avocado egg rolls. No  no not all at once but maybe once day. All of the items I listed are very good. I recommend the flatbread and the bruschetta. They are very lite and refreshing  not too heavy so you can still get your buzz on. They have $4 beer and $6 wines which include La Creama Pinot Noir  one of my go to wines. Sports are always on and on huge TVs over the bar. The crowd is a mix so no weird age group thing going on there. All in all I think it's a really good place for what it is and I recommend it to all happy hour goers!Right behind the puente hills mall on the movies side  plenty of parking and walking distance from target. C'mon if that doesn't do it for you than I don't know what will.
Kyle P.,West Covina  CA,2,20,11,10/18/2014,5.0,I WENT TO THE BAR ONLY  great service!Great beer and good place for a date. Reccomend all day.Time to get messed up
Nicole I.,Covina  CA,154,18,3,11/7/2016,1.0,Note to BJ's: when every single one of your chain restaurant locations garners the same 3-Star rating on Yelp  it's probably time to re-think your business plan. My boyfriend and I chose to visit on a Sunday night after both of us had worked long  hard shifts in the customer service industry. We were looking forward to a nice meal but unfortunately this was denied us by our terribly rude server  who will from this point forward be referred to as Man Bun. Our appetizer and waters were delivered in a timely manner but everything else just plummeted from there. Man Bun treated us like we were an inconvenience and didn't seem to care about doing his job. Our drinks took about an hour to be brought to our table  even though I could plainly see my drink sitting there getting warm as our booth was less than ten feet from the bar. No silverware was brought with our plates and Man Bun had disappeared. I had to flag down a passing server after being ignored for 20 minutes. My boyfriend's beer took more than an hour to make its way to our table  because that's how long it took our server to put in the order. During this time we actually attempted to flag down the manager  who willfully ignored us  and walked away. Man Bun didn't start providing decent service until we were finished with our meal  ostensibly because he was worried about his tip. It was too little too late for that  as I refused to leave a tip for the privilege of being ignored. In lieu of that  Man Bun received a hand-written note about bettering his service skills. It took away my appetite  and as I sit here eating my leftovers  I can only reflect that the food is much more palatable when not paired with horrendous service.
Marvelous M.,Oxnard  CA,1,21,,12/4/2016,1.0,"Ordered a medium Supreme Pizza for take out  and was told it would be 15 mins  I paid for my pizza and sat in my car in the designated take out parking spaces. I walked in 20 minutes later just standing in the take out section looking dumb founded as there employees were just looking at me as if I was just there to hang out. I asked is that my pizza in that little oven warmer on the ground and immediately the Bjs employee gave me a look like who the hell are you!!!! So he grabbed the pizza and I placed the receipt on the table and stupid enough he says ""did you pay for this"" I was like OMG the receipt was right there in front of him idiot!!!!! So he grabs the pizza and for some reason goes thorough the side kitchen!!!! I was like where is he going!!!! Did he spit in my pizza or what!!!! So finally he comes right out and just places the pizza on the front take out table and turns his back and basically says here you go!!!! I just don\'t know why he grabbed my pizza and went back into the kitchen that\'s very odd!!!!"
Dean R.,La Puente  CA,111,28,44,5/2/2016,4.0,Everything in our takeout order was perfect  lost a star because of the 3 strands of hair I got in my pizza
Kari O.,Hacienda Heights  CA,674,294,874,1/5/2015,2.0,Our sever was kind of a jerkWe came during happy hour on a weekday and he had an attitude problem. I ordered some fish tacos and my manfriend ordered the endless soup and salad. Once we ordered the endless soup and salad we noticed a change in attitude. I get it  more work for a smaller check. WE TIP. WE TIP WELL if it's deserved. The busboy deserves a promotion to server because he was amazing. Came over and checked on us  made jokes  smiled. Not the best experience at BJ's
Ron L.,Covina  CA,4995,1336,4973,12/27/2014,3.0,Christmas Eve..and all through the night not a creature did stir Not even a mouse...except us four little peeps ..Not to much open on Christmas Eve...but BJ's was ....Second time I've been to this one with friends...to have a great time..Both times good food and good serviceThe waiter would have to tell us about that pizookie....darn darn darnIt's not that I'm on a diet...but I really have to be careful of what I eat now.So  I got the baby pizookie. Delicious. delicious. delicious chocolate chip and ice cream...but I did leave 1/3 on the plate.
Jen N.,La Puente  CA,286,72,1023,4/10/2015,3.0,Very small table for 2. For appetizers  I'd recommend the calamari and stay away from the eggrolls. For pizzas  try the Sweet Pig-- it's better than the Great White  BJ'S Favorite  and Buffalo Chicken. Drinks are always good here so def come during happy hours.
Lisa S.,Los Angeles  CA,169,308,1529,1/16/2014,3.0,First time I ate at BJ's I felt sick after. I don't know if I had food poisoning or indigestion lolThis location wasn't too bad. Had a get together for a girls night out. We ordered a salad  a pizza  2 pasta's and shared it family style.Great place if you want to enjoy a few drink when you have family (aka kids) with you lol
Eric L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,37,42,329,7/31/2015,4.0,I had the BBQ bacon brisket burger. It was awesome. The burger was tender and the BBQ sauce was really good. BJ is a great place to eat really good food and the beers are not that bad either.
Homer d.,West Covina  CA,93,26,10,12/27/2014,2.0,This place has gone downhill. This particular BJ's has always lacked the friendliness of the Covina BJ's   but at least the food used to be good. Nope. Not anymore. Friend ordered a burger to be cooked medium  but they burnt it so bad that the patty was broken up into several dry burnt chunks. I don't know why they even let that out of the kitchen. They did replace it though.Me and my other friend had pasta; mine was clumpy and dry  his he said tasted like boiled pasta with some tomatoes on the side. Pizza was whatever. Service was a little on the bad side  with the waitress eager to keep giving our bill despite us watching the game and 1 guy continually drinking. We still tipped over 15%  but I won't be coming back to this BJ's.
Robert A.,Whittier  CA,50,145,40,5/10/2015,4.0,Let's get something straight. BJ's is known for their custom brews and their pizza. You know what? Their beer selections are good. Darn good. Their pizza ... eh... it doesn't suck  but it's not the first thing that I (or fellow Yelpers) should reach for. Their menu may not be as vast as other places out there  but seriously  take a gander at their sandwiches and burgers for starters  and you won't be disappointed. Oh  and if you're here before 4 on the weekdays  they've got some darn good lunch deals too that won't bust your wallet  but may bust your belly.The restaurant itself is very nice. Great lighting and ambiance overall. It can get a little loud when it's busy  but it's still just a nice place to look at from the inside.Service here is never an issue. I've always had a pleasurable experience with the people that work here.
Jenn L.,Saint Louis  MO,51,33,42,5/14/2015,3.0,I can't say I liked this place  but it's not too horrible either. you can come if you are with a lot of friends and you all liked baseball/football/basketball and want a place where you can watch and eat at the same time. food is mediocre at best. way too salty  way too fat. most current visit we had pizza (thin skinned) and avocado wrap  both are too much. avocado wrap was a bit better than the pizza.beer was great though. so again I recommend BJ's to people who likes beer and ESPN (or something of the sort).
Nancy W.,Los Angeles  CA,125,117,92,10/21/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This restaurant has gone way down. Service is slow  unhelpful  and sometimes downright rude. Food portions have been reduced significantly. I used to come here almost every week. Last week's experience was so bad  I don't think I EVER want to go back again.
roger l.,Diamond Bar  CA,115,232,214,1/20/2015,3.0,BJ has gone down in portion  I prefer Yardhouse any time of day. The pasta is normally quite salty and the pizza always come with super small portions of toppings  now what is up with that?!Service was hit or miss. Beer is great  but food is just 3 stars.
Stephanie R.,Baldwin Park  CA,4,62,19,3/4/2016,4.0,I prefer this location over the Eastland Covina location. The service is always better  there are more tables usually available and the beer is fresher. All the food is always good.
Lesley D.,Walnut  CA,67,4,,6/18/2016,1.0,"More than just terrible service. I came here for dinner with a couple of my friends and we arrived at about 7pm. We got seated at about 7:11 and we ordered our food shortly after. Our first server Steve went on break and our next server Kenny took over and introduced himself. We waited for about 20 minutes and our server came and told us that our food would be out soon. However  time continued to pass by and 10 minutes later he came again to tell us our food would be arriving soon. ANOTHER 10 minutes passed by and my friend asked where our food was and he told us he would find out and send the manager over to us. The manager  Taylor  came over and explained that our food was given to another table  that it food was being remade and that it was at the top of their priority. She said it would only take a couple more minutes and then asked us if she could get us anything. However  it seemed kind of useless to order an appetizer when our food would be coming out ""soon"". She wanted to let us know that this did not usually happen. However  she didn\'t really offer a solution or proper closure to the accident. We told her we were fine and we continued to wait for our food. After about 10 more minutes of waiting  Kenny  our server told us that he was sorry  our food would be out right away and that he knows that it sucks for us. Yes. It did suck. We didn\'t need to be made aware of that fact. So of course  we wait some more and finally after over an hour of waiting(total)  our food comes. The food was okay. Nothing special. Definitely not worth the amount of time we waited. We didn\'t order dessert because the amount of time we might have had to wait for it would be frightening. My friend asked for a box for her food and it was not given to her so she had to ask another waiter.We asked for our checks and we paid our bills separately. My meal came out to be $17.71 and I paid with a $20 bill. My change came back as $2. My other friends did not get full change for their meals either. By this time  we were so done with this place and the frustrating experience. A simple sorry  it won\'t happen again  does not make things any better."
Jenn T.,Westminster  CA,68,16,8,10/17/2014,1.0,I have never felt so neglected at a restaurant till now thanks to our server. Our server is currently MIA while waiting for the check and from what I can tell  we're the biggest group they have tonight so I have no idea what's the hold up especially since it's not even that crowded. If you're reading this  Lawrence  please come back cause we gotta go home!12:10 AMDay 2 since it's midnight now. We're still here waiting on our cards and receipts back and sucking on the very last remnants of our ice since no one came to refill our cups. Lawrence  please come back with our cards  we got our lives to attend to and we've been here for way too long.
Johel S.,Rowland Heights  CA,0,8,5,4/8/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I've been to this place several times the food is amazing and the Pizookies they sell are amazing but the reason I'm giving it a 1 star is due to the fact that every time I've eaten there the service give. has been terrible. That's all I have to say so if your willing to but up with waiters that hate their jobs and have terrible attitudes then be my guest and go. #20minutewaits
Ernesto M.,Corona  CA,81,215,95,2/22/2015,3.0,The service was pretty lame. She seemed attentive at first but then really sucked. We were sitting in the bar area at a small round table with another couple so you need all the space you can get  she wouldn't even take the empty glasses!!! Had to ask the person who bought the food. A little pricey but I will give it a second try.
Ron G.,Walnut  CA,1,23,2,2/26/2017,1.0,I usually go to this BJ cause it's closer to my house then the West Covina location. Went in this past Friday night and sat at a table at the bar area to avoid the long wait for a table. Elissa M was our server. She was friendly and took our order for food and drinks. Our order came to our table at a decent time for a Friday night. Elissa cane by to check if everything was ok and I showed her my plate of food that I ordered and had a long piece of hair in it. Whoever the food preparer or cook was in the kitchen probably wasn't wearing a hair net or hat. Elissa apologized and took my plate and would get me another order. The order took forever and my girlfriend already finished her food when my new order came in. I remember going to other restaurants where my order was wrong or had a problem and the server would be on it right away and even have the manager come by and apologize. Elissa even though she was friendly and not rude didn't expedite my reorder nor did she even come by and refill our drinks. I noticed Elissa was more attentive to her party's of 4 I get it because you want to work for that tip  but treat everyone the same.
Tina L.,Arcadia  CA,54,5,,1/30/2015,4.0,I like the environment in it. The food are very good too ;) Happy hour price are pretty good but dinner Manu is a little bit pricy.Service are very good  got serve in a timely manner
Lisa D.,La Puente  CA,0,9,1,12/31/2015,1.0,The flatware glasses and napkins all had bits of old food on them. I will not return to this location.
Marty M.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,29,28,10/31/2013,5.0,Excellent place for happy hour. Great prices  food  and atmosphere. I think this BJs has the best ambience and atmosphere around town.The restaurant is nice and dark but is lighted up by their selection of liquor. They have a nice big flat screen in the middle of the bar. Some of their bartenders seem a bit coo coo but Trish is really attentive and accommodating. She makes her drinks well. Great bartender with a positive attitude.I'll be back!
Jenny N.,Walnut  CA,151,190,73,9/21/2014,2.0,"Came here to eat dinner on a Sunday evening.Got seated quickly.. But our table had not been wiped down properly. The server wiped it down so no problem. Ordered our drinks... Took at least ten minutes to get them. Ordered our food when the drinks came cause I was afraid I wouldn\'t see my server again for a lengthy time. I ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi. Then came the wait.About 30-35 min later our food arrived and our server was running around  we hadn\'t seen him since we ordered our food. The mahi mahi was dry and a little burned on top. I\'m sure that\'s why I waited so long for my food  cause it was drying out from being overcooked. Would I order this again? No. Could service had been better? Our server Alex could have come by earlier to at least give us a status of our food. The only saving grace was when our server went on break and was relieved by James. He made sure to check on us and get us refills and just ask ""if everything was OK"" when he did actually ask us  I wasn\'t in the mood to bring up the fact that my mahi mahi was dry and overcooked. Long story short  don\'t come here if starving and you don\'t mind waiting for your food for a long while.Side note  someone who appeared to be a manager  came by to pick up one of our plates  normally they would ask how everything tasted  not him  he didn\'t seem happy to be there. I know he wasn\'t a busser cause they wear different outfits."
Catt F.,Whittier  CA,18,7,5,11/8/2015,1.0,"Not happy with this place. A few weeks ago we were having a family dinner. We understand it was busy. Our granddaughter got her meal last  pasta. I was sitting next to her as she was taking out the broccoli and noticed something ""BLUE"" on her plate!! It was chewed gum!!! We were all so disgusted  we all just stopped eating! After a few minutes the waitress came around and pointed it out to her  she took it away. Later a manager came over and asked if he could bring her another pasta. Of course not was my angry answer. We paid and left. Yes we still had to pay!! So disappointed  with this location. Not going back there. Keep an eye on your plate."
Mary P.,Anaheim  CA,297,291,223,10/18/2014,1.0,Went here for my friend's birthday. We were a party of 10 but everyone got there and ordered at different times yet we all got out food at the same time  which means some of us waited over 30 minutes for our food. We didn't even get a round of water for our group  our server was MIA for most of the night. It even took At least 15 minutes for him to give us back our cards after we paid. The place was not crowded as we got there at 10pm so we didn't understand what the big hold up was. All in all we ended up leaving at 12:30 when we got there at 10pm  mostly because we were in a waiting game with our server. Definitely won't be back to this place.
Cindy T.,Orange County  CA,743,408,1210,4/21/2013,3.0,Dinner was ok. The portions are kind of small. I had a chicken pasta limone and it was tiny. It came with really good garlic bread though. I had to eat a slice of my bf's pizza because I didn't think it was enough food. I do eat a lot  but seriously  I get full from other places though. I definitely had enough room for dessert. We got the red velvet pizookie. It was pretty good. The cookie was warm and the vanilla ice cream was a good compliment to it. Service was kind of spotty the whole night. Our server took our older and didn't return until 20 minutes after to say that he will look for our food. Seriously? Then he disappeared again. But he picked up the check really quick though. Had a fun night watching the Clippers game though and just general people watching.
Felicia L.,Long Beach  CA,599,1565,658,8/14/2013,3.0,It was a Sunday and I met up with a friend here for an early dinner. It was so crowded! Hard to find parking. I guess it's a pretty popular spot  well at least for that area being neighbors with Red Lobster and Golden Corral.We sat at the bar and ordered a pomegranate margarita and a white peach sangria. The margarita was good  as well as the sangria... but not strong at all. The fruits in the sangria were not fresh fruits but frozen... but hey at least they put fruits. We also shared a small spinach and artichoke pizza which was good and plenty for the both of us. I always liked BJ's pizza mainly because of the pizza dough and how they bake it. It goes very well with the spinach and artichoke. As for the service it was friendly despite being busy. Overall a good spot.
Nicole T.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,7,,4/29/2016,1.0,"I tried to make reservations for a party of 6 for my daughter\'s birthday and they would not take a reservation. The manager was not helpful at all!! They have some type of ""call ahead"" system  but you could potentially still have to wait 30 minutes to an hour to be seated. This process is ridiculous. My family and I USED to eat here a lot  but not anymore. Customer service sucks!!"
Imran K.,Walnut  CA,3708,718,48,7/25/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,This is a busy location and has enormous parking  went for dinner 5 people were seated quickly the staff is very cooperative and helpful. For starters had Spinach And Artichoke Dip  that is served warm with crisp corn tortilla chips  there was pleanty left over after we all tried this. Tried the Seared Ahi Salad with baby field greens  napa cabbage  romaine and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette. Served with tomatoes  avocado  pickled cucumber  cilantro  wasabi  crisp wonton strips and green onions I got the pizza with pineapple and jalapenos Avocado Egg RollsA blend of avocados  cream cheese  sundried tomatoes  red onions  cilantro  pine nuts  chipotle peppers and spices. Served with a sweet tamarind sauce. Su[per tasty with their sweet dip.I ordered Vegetarian Sliced mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions  pineapple and seasoned tomatoes. Came out delicious.My drink was lemonade their pink lemonade is tasty.Loved and enjoyed the evening.
Bxstr M.,Walnut  CA,1,12,12,2/28/2016,1.0,The feeling I get when ever I come here is they just want you to hurry up and eat and leave I spent 125 bucks today and I couldn't even enjoy my beer because every time I took a sip of my beer the waiter would come and ask me if I was ready to order I wish they would take it easy and let people enjoy there evening
Brit L.,Walnut  CA,296,88,83,2/2/2014,3.0,I've NEVER really had a problem here at this Bj's location  but this past weekend was horrible ! I was treating out my boyfriend for his birthday dinner and we waited for 40 minutes for our entrees--A hamburger and some dried ass pasta ... so thats just 2 stars. Then the bill came and we saw that our waiter was nice enough to take out the entrees from our bill and throw in free mini pazookies  hence the 3rd star.
Daryl M.,La Puente  CA,3,9,3,8/27/2015,1.0,"You Know What?? This Place has gone to the Dumps!I was Just there with my Family and It was By Far the Worst Time EVER.We were seated with a damn near empty place yet And still it was like we didnt exist.Several Waiters Walked right by us as if the place was jumping.I know Im BLACK as Hell But Im pretty Sure you Saw My ""Light"" Wife and Kids If not Im sure you heard my Kids...We Sat there for 15-20 mins Without even being asked for our drinks.This Isnt the 1st time we experienced this service and I thought it was a Fluke that time.Given the Benefit of doubt I continued to be a Loyal Fan Of the food and Generous tipper but this was my last draw.We Walked out and The Hostess That sat us didnt even bother to ask is everything ok! I am A Rewards customer but i will not be going back there ever."
Edwin A.,Los Angeles  CA,12,4,,8/5/2016,1.0,this location is one of the worst customer service i have ever experience. the hostess werent much of a help and keep talking with each other instead of knowledge in the customer. then after 1hr late  we ask if the patio was an options when they should of told us since the beginning. then we order appetizers and they havent even set up the places of utensils. over all the waiter (lawrence) was a good help and seen to try to be everywhere. i would not come back to this place due to bad worst and unprofessional customer service.
Maggie C.,Los Angeles  CA,3674,2688,11470,12/27/2012,3.0,We didn't have a lot of options to celebrate a co-worker's birthday.We shared some appetizers and I ordered fish & chips.Crisp potato skins and avocado eggrolls were kinda good. I liked the eggroll better than the potato and it was kinda spicy.My fish & chips were kinda good at first but I got tired of eating it after a while. My skinny fries were good.3 stars!!BJ's is almost yummylicious!!
Joel B.,Santa Ana  CA,6,55,,2/2/2016,1.0,I have been very pleased with the food at other BJs before but I had the BJs Brewery Burger today at this BJs and it was absolutely terrible. It was so over cooked it was almost crispy. The fries were good but the burgers at fast food places are far better and much less expensive.
Clarissa P.,La Habra  CA,30,5,,9/8/2015,2.0,I have been a customer of this restaurant since they opened a few years ago. I went yesterday and was surprised to find what appeared to be all new staff behind the bar and as wait staff. The service used to be incredibly good here but yesterday it was just plain bad. They brought salad but no silverware. I had to ask three times to get a fork. Getting a refill on ice tea was almost impossible. When the pizzookie came it was totally raw inside. I mentioned that to the waitress when she brought the bill ( I was still waiting for more ice tea which never came) and she said she would mention it to the manager to let him know. I hope that this was just a case of them not having enough staff on duty for the Holiday but both the food and the service was really off compared to how it normally is.
Eri K.,Irvine  CA,536,472,333,11/3/2011,4.0,"PROS:- Hostess in the front were pretty nice and efficient- The food came out pretty fast- We ordered the NEW crunchy Jalapeno burger that came with string fries. It was extremely delicious. The meat was meadium-well and was very juicy. It came with a good amount of fries with it.- Also had the ""small bites"" appetizers:  1) Spinach stuffed mushrooms: REALLY delicious and juicy  2) Mozarella and Tomato salad: delicious  crispy salad  *drools*- Ordered 2 handcrafted root beers...so delicious. It was nice and cold  fresh from the tapCONS:- Their service was OK. I\'ve had better- Small booths for small parties. We were just party of 2 so we had to sit in small booths"
Mimi L.,Torrance  CA,3196,1013,9711,4/12/2011,4.0,#1 reason I go to BJ's? Piranha hoppy pale Ale!!!!! I can drink a pitcher by myself no kidding! I love Brewhouse  I am an Ale person! They have good food too  I like ahi poke  chicken or shrimp lettuce wrap  seafood jambalaya  and they have good pizzas too  sometimes I go for a turkey burger  wash down with some Ale.... heaven! They have good happy hour  all tab beer 1 dollar off  and discount on appetizers and mini pizzas .One of my favorite Brewhouse  and they have my favorite Piranha!!! yummy! perfect for my usual Sunday beer day!
Danny W.,Hacienda Heights  CA,34,9,20,2/10/2016,4.0,The BJs bar area has 3 big screen tvs and great to watch LA Lakers game on big screen tv. Happy hour are Monday to Friday 3 to 7 pm with 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas and $2 off shareable appetizers. Bar area has round and rectangular tables with high chairs. I also ordered BJ favorite mini deep dish pizza and the avocado guacamole and salsa chips and dip  which is Pretty Good new item! It wasn't very busy on Wednesday night. Busier and packed on Friday nights. Good location near the puente hills mall. Customer service is great with friendly attitude waiter with great service. I would recommend this place to watch NBA games during happy hour!
Isabelle C.,Olympia  WA,3,86,10,6/30/2014,1.0,I had a late night dinner~1 beer & Ahi Poke appetizer. I threw up after I got home... twice. and worse  I didn't even get my change back after I paid cash. This is BAD! I was sick for 2 days after that! sent my comment to BJ's on-line and that branch manager sent me an email said he wants to talk to me again... for what? I emailed him and explained the same thing again and never got any response back since! VERY BAD!!!!! So glad I cancelled a company party I was going to have it there. My company switched our usual hang-out bar to somewhere else.My advice: don't expect a response from them if you get sick from eating their food!
Patricia V.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,3,,10/7/2015,2.0,I just got my lunch via take out. I ordered the santa fe salad and it was very small for a lunch salad too small for is being $14 . The salad was good but not good enough to be that pricey. If I knew it would be that small I would've gone to Chili's across the street. Their lunch salads are larger and less expensive. Not only was the salad disappointing   I had ordered the peach berry tea and while driving back to work I took a sip and it was if I had just drank the peach syrup they put into the drink. I thought maybe I had to mix it. After mixing is it was still as if I had a cup full of syrup way too sweet. I even added a whole cup of water and it is still to sweet. If I had time I would have driven back but I didn't.
Jeffrey C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,210,115,44,10/23/2015,5.0,I think BJ's is a good one. The pizzas r good. The desserts r good. The rolls with the starters r good. There is a selection of pizzas at this restaurant.
Richard J.,San Jose  CA,21,12,13,9/20/2015,1.0,I used to love to come to this place  but just tonight the service is soo fucking bad  the server completely forgot our table  we need to asked another pass by server for our bill and box.
Mrs. G.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,7,,2/24/2016,2.0,We eat here quite often but today had a terrible meal. The brussells sprouts were burned beyond recognition and salted beyond belief  and we sent them back.The Fish and Chips were soggy  the fish was under-cooked and the plate was swimming in grease (the fries were OK).  My husbands salmon was over-cooked  however  he ate it anyway. Although they took the brussells sprouts and fish & chips off our bill  it ruined our lunch together and I hope that I don't become ill from what little of the greasy under-cooked fish I tasted.
keith l.,Anaheim  CA,2,20,1,9/5/2015,1.0,"I haven\'t written a review in a while  but with some time to kill and a recent poor experience i felt compelled to write. Went to this location the other day with some friends for some pizza and wings. I\'ve been here several times and have noticed that the quality of the food and service continues to fall. Ordered a couple pizzas  some pasta dishes  some wings and some pizookies. What I noticed happened not once but several times throughout the night is that our waitstaff continued to say that they saw that our food had come out of the kitchen  but they didn\'t bring it to our table until 5-8 minutes afterwards. This happened with our pizza  wings and pizookies. Needless to say  the pizza was lukewarm. It was cool enough that i could touch and hold the pan that the pizza had come in. The wings were soggy  and for being ""XXX"" hot  barely had any flavor  in addition to being lukewarm. i would venture to call the wings gross even. And finally  the pizookies were tasty  but again it was evident that they were sitting out for a bit as the ice cream was runny and some serious ice runoff had begun. The server gave the excuse that she saw the pizookies but wasn\'t notified to pick them up (whatever that means). In any case  the poor service here is a sign of some serious management flaws.  Get your act together  BJs of Rowland Heights."
Mary N.,Los Alamitos  CA,466,1617,984,10/30/2014,4.0,large parking lot.standard BJs offeringsFriendly and fast service.
Tammy C.,San Dimas  CA,308,468,874,7/11/2014,1.0,Whenever a friend suggest going to BJ'S I am always in....pizookie on my mind. I usually go to the BJ's in Covina and Arcadia. However  my friend lives in Hacienda Heights  so we came to this location. We came at 12:30 and the parking lot was ridiculously filled. There is plenty of parking in the back  but I didn't feel safe having my car in such an isolated area  so we parked in the Golden Corral lot....sorry. Luckily  my friend  got there before me and snagged a table. This is a small location and it was packed....mind you the world cup game was on. The waiter took our drink order............which took a loooooooooooooong time....perhaps because of the World Cup. We ordered an appetizer  which was fine... the problem is when 2/3 people have been served lunch........and you are waiting........I told my friends to go ahead and eat  since their meals were warm. Both of my friends had completed their meal before mine finally came out. My friend asked for a 2nd bowl of soup.....by the time that came out...I was done. The waiter claims that they ran out of soup and had to make some more...not sure if that was true or he forgot. the fact that we sat next to their computer distracts them from us.... my opinion  because they just rush back and forth to that machine and miss what's right in front of them. I will always go back to BJ's for the pizookie.....probably not at this location.
Ana M.,City of Industry  CA,149,1,,2/17/2016,1.0,"Walked in. Stood in front of the host desk with a hostess in the booth and maybe 4 servers talking to her. Long brown hair on a short little girl. She obviously saw us. Stood there for 30 seconds until I finally said "" are we invisible?"" Then she finally asked ""how many?"" No hello. No greeting. No I\'m sorry. I don\'t understand how you can screw up being a hostess. Terrible. Hope our server is better."

I found out later that they DID have happy hour- so i am not sure what happened there! I also found out that our server told us some wrong info for their rewards program i inquired about also- hope they step things up with making things more consistent!!!We didn't have a problem at all with other things that many yelpers complained about- the horrible wait and the bad service. We were seated quickly and were acknowledged by our server promptly as well. I had been craving club sandwiches and i found one on the menu that had all my fave things. CHICKEN  AVOCADO AND BACON! The only thing tho is that the bread was really greasy. I have concluded that i love my Club from CA GRILL the best cuz their bread is plain and not greasy at all. My friend got a pizza and a margarita and was satisfied. We were too stuffed to indulge in a pizookie. Overall we had a good time despite a couple of inconsistencies i found out later and it would have been nice to not have been given the bill to us when we weren't even half way done with our meal. (it was early evening still!). Next time i will stick to the BJs in torrance and get my pizzookie!
Sonia M.,La Puente  CA,3,13,43,11/25/2014,4.0,I've been here a couple of times. Honestly BJs beats any other chain restaurant on food & service.
JK C.,Malibu  CA,4,109,778,8/30/2013,4.0,BJS is a very enjoyable restaurant to spend time with friends and family. Many people claim that this eatery is highly overpriced  yet I have a feeling many of these people have not even stepped foot into this establishment. As a rewards member  you can always call in early and request to be in front of the line. Once you show up  you are quickly led to your booth and it is quite comfortable. There is a certain vibe that is given off  from the multiple TVs to the bar  that certainly makes place great for a family dinner. The endless choices of appetizers are quite appealing  and extremely tasty. I personally love the avocado egg rolls and the potato skins. I am definitely a fan and I will continue to come here in the future.
Michael L.,La Puente  CA,95,7,1,1/2/2016,5.0,You guys are full shit I get the upmost best service a beer chugging man ask for !!! My service is always on point
Jackie T.,La Puente  CA,45,153,69,5/21/2014,1.0,Bj's did the impossible for me... they made me hate pasta for the first time in my entire life. They've also lost plenty of their loyal customers last night. We called ahead to book a reservation for a graduation party since our party was more than 7 . The hostess would not let us book an appointment simply because she said there wouldn't be a wait. That's not the point a reservation. It's supposed to give the kitchen and staff the heads up that there's a big party coming in. We waited more than an hour for our food while others around us who came half an hour after us  got their food. Half of the people at our table receieved ice cold pasta and mine was missing meatballs. Take 2: 30 minutes later the pasta was hot  but my meatballs were cold and mostly fillings. I asked for meatsauce but I got marinara. One star for the manager stepping up and apologizing without giving excuses or blaming others. Also  he took off 50% of our total bill since he saw how upset we all were ( we even turned down free soup  salad  and dessert). We just wanted to go home after 3 hours of chaos. We noticed around us that other larger parties were upset too. This place is okay for a party of 4 or less and the lunchtime menu is reasonable. Other than that  DON'T BOOK LARGER PARTIES HERE.
carmen b.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,7,7,2/9/2015,4.0,I always love going to BJ's  The food is never disappointing. The drink are awesome  well I only ever drink margaritas but of all the restaurants around I like the margaritas here  I give them a 10. The staff are very friendly they are always making sure everything is ok.
Peter P.,Hacienda Heights  CA,15,158,2,4/24/2013,4.0,Endless soda  great beer  great pizza and service.I don't care if it's a chain  it's great food and a place to hang out late at night after a hard day's work.Their chicken marsala was quite good; I'd try our their other pizza alternatives as well in the future.
Jackson W.,Los Angeles  CA,125,131,91,6/16/2014,3.0,I don't frequent BJ's in general. But I never mind going. Pizzas are okay. Maybe I'm just not a fan in general of deep dish unless it's the kind of deep dish they serve in Chicago Fire in downtown Sacramento.I was very disappointed with BJ's Ahi Poke appetizer. Just didn't taste right at all. I should have given it back  but didn't think to. The wonton chips were perfectly fine. However the tuna was just really sad. Tasted like they just mixed some green onions  d-grade diced tuna sashimi  and tossed it around in some bland soy sauce  then topped it over a bed of finely chopped cabbage with sesame seeds. By far the worst Ahi Poke I've ever had. You would think that if a chain restaurant offered something like this  they would make it an appealing item to order. However  it tasted like this dish was a complete afterthought. Just seemed like there were so many missing ingredients. Even my friend was disgusted by this dish.On the plus side  the berry limeade was a great refreshing drink. Definitely got me hooked. And you can't leave without having a pizookie!
Tina Luo Real Estate Broker L.,Rowland Heights  CA,1,4,8,2/4/2015,5.0,I invited two of my friends for lunch  they both never come BJ in the before.We love their Avacado Egg Roll  my friends ordered lemon chick and I orderedpasta. Both tasted very good.

Mihae F.,Hacienda Heights  CA,14,43,12,9/26/2015,3.0,We have been to this location probably 15 times....since it opened and they have yet to resolve their biggest issue; the food comes out so dang slow! !!!! It took 27 minutes for my daughter's birthday pazookie to come out. It's almost as if their kitchen is too small or they are continuously short staffed. I wish they cpuld get it right because everything else works! Hosting staff  wait staff  food quality. .....
Vi V.,Orange County  CA,278,760,3327,2/8/2011,3.0,I was in the mood for chicken tenders and I remembered that there was a BJ's close to the Puente Hills Mall so me and my bf decided to go there for lunch. It wasn't super crowded so we didn't have to wait long to get a table. What we got:Chicken Tenders with Crispy-thin fries: it came with honey mustard and ranch dipping sauce which I did enjoy. Hand-breaded Chicken Parmigiana: he let me have a couple of bites and I thought it was just okay. Maybe it's because of not a fan of chicken and pasta. As for the serve  it wasn't bad. The server came back with another strawberry lemonade even if I still had a third of it left =]
Sandy K.,Whittier  CA,2981,1573,9337,7/12/2012,3.0,Came in on Friday after a round of golf with my co worker. It was quite busy and the place is set up with a sports bar atmosphere. It was nice and we watched the woman's US open while we had lunch. BJ's has come a long way since I dined at the location in Belmont Shores! Since going public they have really gone big box for sure.My order the lunch special - crispy  hand breaded  buttermilk fried chicken breast  pepper cream gravy  white cheddar mashed potatoes and corn and fire-roasted red pepper succotash. The entree was tasty but the chicken was on the small side. I thought it was pricey for around $10.00 I was actually still hungry after my meal!Next time I think we'll wait in line at Golden Corral next store.
Aerial A.,Los Angeles  CA,19,604,67,9/12/2015,5.0,I really like BJ's restaurants. My friend and I came for the $25 deal. We got a bacon and ranch tavern cut pizza  chicken tortilla soup  clam chowder  and the cookies and cream pizookie. Everything was great food wise and the service was excellent as well.
Sloppy H.,Irvine  CA,36,32,13,8/18/2015,1.0,Returned entree twice because it was overcooked. Manager was not apologetic and did not seem to care. Get a new career if u hate your job.
Lynn B.,Los Angeles  CA,85,241,12,3/2/2014,5.0,i've been to this Bj's restaurant several times  but last week the service I received was on point! All the managers came to greet our table  the servers were super attentive  and the hostess was very friendly. I was so surprised at how much attention our table got. Thanks  BJ for your SUPER friendly service. I was impressed!!
Catalina T.,Azusa  CA,666,732,2220,8/23/2012,3.0,We sometimes order from here a good amount of times for pick up. In one of the first occasions that we had placed an order  they didn't provide me with the bbq dressing for our bbq chicken salad and our pizza was incorrect. This wasn't the first time that they had forgotten something out of our order so I had asked them to please double check and make sure that everything was in there  since they kept getting the orders wrong. Sadly I showed up back to my work place with no bbq sauce/dressing for the salad (which was the most expensive thing in our order)  semi cold pizzas and no utensils for our lunch. I decided to call since this wasn't the first time and inform them that the dressing wasn't included and make them aware to double check their orders. Who I spoke too claimed to have been the manager and actually had the decency to ask me to drive back to pick up the dressing?!!! REALLY??!! CMON! This should have been taken care of the first time before I left and you asking me to go back to pick it up was rude. She then offered to send me some gift card to compensate for the dressing. No one at work ate the salad since its not that great missing the dressing. We never received the gift cards either. I then proceeded to write a letter to corporate about their customer service and I sadly never heard back from them. I was disappointed that they do not double check their orders. I would recommend anyone that picks up lunch here to check their orders before leaving the restaurant or they will ask you to come back to fix it.The good thing is that they do have other things other than their over doughy pizzas. Sadly when I think of BJs I think of pazookies and pizza and their pizzas are sooo not recommended from here. We've ordered a variety of them but for some reason they aren't that good  at least not to go. We also stopped ordering the bbq chicken cobb salad and stuck to the regular BJs cobb. We do not order the pizzas any more and we stick to their sandwiches which to my surprise have always been well prepared and don't lack on flavor or ingredients. They all have been satisfying and good enough to keep us coming back ordering the a la carte style. As for customer service  I do not pick up the orders anymore  I just place them over the phone and so far at least over the phone  they have been friendlier and more helpful (their party platters changed recently and the lady that helped me over the phone was really helpful and especially really patient). Bjs cobb salad is good. As for my favorite sandwich so far from them I would say the roasted turkey cobb. The avocado egg rolls arent' that bad either.
Tejas M.,Anaheim  CA,294,296,47,2/21/2014,2.0,"The ambiance is nice but the happy hour services were poor. When I ordered an extra drink before the end of happy hour  the response from the waitress was ""you can\'t order more until you are done (or may be half done) with the current drink"" This is one of the biggest BS I have heard! Wonder why do they have pitchers on menu with this kind of a policy?... Hehe :)"
Monica V.,Hacienda Heights  CA,39,23,2,8/19/2015,1.0,Angel Hair Classico was horrible was dry & sticky not much flavor chicken tasted like rubber it was supposed to be blackened but did not look like it at all well it gets worse I felt sick all night felt nauseous and woke up with a headache .... Will not be returning to this place . The only good thing was it was my granddaughters birthday they brought her this cookie with ice cream thing but didn't even sing to her the waiter just dropped it off and ran I guess they don't do that there but the ice cream was good I guess cause it wasn't made there
Geraldine S.,Los Angeles  CA,203,66,131,3/3/2012,2.0,The service at this particular BJ's is horrible!!! The waiters are nice but they're just too damn slow! On top of that  they're forgetful. You ask them for a refill of a diet coke  a spoon  and honey mustard... they come back with only two of the three things. COME ON  ADRIAN*.My cousin felt bad for not saying please but let's be honest  after we ask for something twice and we still don't get it  on the third request  manners go out the window.*Don't worry  that's not our waiter's real name. I'm not that mean  I promise.
Wendy L.,Lakewood  CA,30,17,,5/17/2014,1.0,Zero stars if it was an option. This comment is purely on their customer service. Called today for reservations at 7pm for a large party of 10 ppl and they were absolutely horrible. They asked if it was for a graduation and I said  no. Once I said that  she was like 'oh' we have nothing available at that time. 10pm is free. WTF- who eats 3hrs after the time they requested! Then she suggested 4pm- again WTF. They are absolutely rude and were not able to accommodate at all.
Joshua R.,Whittier  CA,124,56,164,9/7/2015,3.0,I came here with some friends of mine to celebrate out Labor day. Unfortunately the service took longer than expected. We ordered a few rounds of beer  appetizers  and pizza. It took a while for the waitress to get our drinks to us. After we ate  we ordered dessert. It took another 20 minutes to get the order to us. Now if it was busy  I would understand. However  I was definitely seeing empty seats throughout the restaurant. This isn't the first time I've experienced this type of service at this place. If they can somehow improve this  I am willing to give more stars.
Dani S.,Santa Ana  CA,997,2133,4132,12/30/2011,4.0,Happy Hour is the sh*t! 3-7pm M-F  get your drinks on!Different HH drink specials on different days. 1/2 wine on Tue.$2 OFF appetizers  flatbreads; 1/2 off mini pizzas. Available only in the bar area.Ordered Chicken pestos flatbread & Santa Fe spring rolls - both were superb in taste and presentation. Crowd is interesting: lots of salt/pepper men w their beer babies  families w kids  surprisingly no single women anywhere to be seen. They r probably next door at Lowe's checking out guys & their big muscles. At least that's what I would be doing if I wasn't here.
Rosalyn D.,Rowland Heights  CA,415,12,14,4/10/2015,1.0,Came in for lunch for a friend's birthday and couldn't be more disappointed with the slow service. It wasn't even busy. Took more than half an hour just to get my card back; that's just ridiculous.
Jeeyoung P.,Los Angeles  CA,267,256,591,6/27/2012,3.0,My friends and I were STARVING when we came here.They said the wait would be 5 minutes  so we went in.Probably because all the people were lining up at Golden Corral.By the time we were done eating  people were circled around the whole building andcame to BJS.. After we were seated  we ordered:-Mediterranean Pizza-Meatballs and Garlic Bread-Mahi Mahi dish-Caesar salad-1/2 white choc macadamia and 1/2 red velvet pizookieOkay  the food took FOREVER!! Like 40 minutes!!!! Ugh  not good for famished girls. We got a little antsy and blamed our friend who wanted to come here haha. So don't come if you want your food quickly! Anyway  our food finally arrived all at the same time  so that was good.I got the meatballs  they were good  but anything would have tasted good for me at that time. The salad is well salad. Nothing out of the ordinary. Mahi Mahi dish seemed to be average too. I had a slice of my friend's pizza  and I didn't like the flavors. It just tasted like salty olives..After we finished the food  we were not satisfied  so we decided to order the pizookie! Another 20 minutes of waiting  it arrived.The pizookie was probably gone in 3 minutes! SO DELICIOUS.I like the white choc macadamia the best. They even took FOREVER to get our checks and split them! So annoying. I would come to Bjs to try their another pizza and pizookie  but not this location.
David D.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,2,,2/3/2016,1.0,Theirs nothing worse than coming from work trying to enjoy a good meal and expect good service but unfortunately at this establishment it was horrible from the hostess not knowing her job  to servers making faces and throwing coasters at us. I've never been so irritated with the horrible service I was given by Stephanie. My partner and I went in around 3 in the afternoon. Restaurant not even full  our server takes about 7 mins to greet us. Once she gets to us we are all ready with our order so that she didn't have to get the run around. Well here's when the sh** show starts. The food runner who drops off my beer places my beer at the edge of the table then decides to go grab coasters and literally throw them on our table  not place them he stood 2 feet from my table and threw them. I wanted to get up and tell that guy with the beard off so bad because that was simply rude. Then when it the food is finally up  my partner starts to roll up his noodles and a piece of plastic comes from within the dish. DISGUSTING!!! Now for the best part once we told our server that we wanted it remade  she stops and makes a face as if it was an issue. I didn't know your job of taking orders was so hard. Then the manager comes over still charges us for the plate that we didn't eat  and offers dessert. I rather you have been more professional with the matter rather than offering a dessert. BJs you're terrible!!!
Jin U.,Hacienda Heights  CA,193,28,33,6/28/2015,5.0,Went with my family for dinner on a Sunday night. Definitely a busy night but the wait wasn't too bad. (15-20 min) The first server was very rude and inattentive. He didn't even make eye contact and when I asked for recommendations he just said that's the only one with this kind and didn't care about what I had to say. My parents are very easy going and even they all thought he was very rude and gave everyone a negative vibe. So we asked to change our server. That was definitely a good choice because the new server who took care of us was one of the most caring and awesome servers we've had. His name was Ahmed and he was so nice and made the dinner way more enjoyable. Kept coming back to check in to make sure everything was going smooth. Definitely let us forget that our first server was the worst. Awesome humor and made the effort to ask for our names and get to know us. Made us feel like we were really welcomed there. There should be more servers like him who gives great impressions to the restaurants and make you want to come back.
Albert W.,Orange  CA,696,1801,60,1/22/2014,3.0,It's a well run chain.  They have the food and process down pat.  There really isn't any surprised.  Sad thing is that people think this is representative of a good pizza joint.
Joel R.,La Puente  CA,197,13,75,3/8/2014,5.0,I love this place!! I always eat & drink at the bar because the bartenders are really cool to talk to. I usually come after work to chill before I head home. The food is great! There's a lot more than just pizza. They have burgers and other entrees if your not looking to eat pizza though by any chance you are looking for pizza I highly recommend getting The Great White pizza which is a chicken pizza with garlic  onions  tomato and Alfredo sauce! They also have two types of crust (original deep dish & hand tossed) and you can never go wrong by finishing your meal with a delicious Pizookie desert! :D enjoi
Raul R.,Coral Springs  FL,25,8,2,12/28/2014,1.0,This place sucks.  Service is crap  ordered a pizookie they gave it to me raw and it took them about an hour to bring it. After they realized that it was still raw they come back and let me know they were going to give me another one and that the manager was going to comp it. I get my check and they still charged me! Table was dirty as hell had to clean it myself. Bad service man. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN IS WAY BETTER!
Steve G.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,43,11,8/29/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,My wife and I went here again last night for dinner. This time I was disappointed with my dinner. I had the House Top Sirloin Steak dinner. When they brought out the plate I thought it was one of those diet plates. Where is the other half of my steak? It was a joke how small it was. Normally the portions at BJ's are very good. This was bad. Even my wife was shocked. We complained to the manager and at first she was like  well that's the size. Then I complained to the waiter and he said he would get me an additional steak. I should have taken a picture of the plate. It was sad! Any way the waiter took care of the problem and everything ended well. I was just surprised because this had never happened and the manager was not going to do anything at first. My wife had the salmon and she said it was great and it looked great on the plate. We will see what happens next time.
Ashley C.,Whittier  CA,0,3,,11/5/2014,5.0,I didn't get the bartenders name  but she was the greatest server! She wasn't wearing a name tag for some reason? Anyways  I left this bj's very satisfied.She recommended that we get a pizooki or whatever they're called. So glad that I did!I will definitely be back soon!!
Gerardo A.,Los Angeles  CA,13,14,,2/2/2014,1.0,Normally  I like BJs  but this location leaves a lot to be desired. The location is nice and the restaurant is big  but that's where the positive comments stop.Me and a friend dropped by on a Saturday afternoon  and ordered pizzas and a pizookie. The waitress we had was a bit cold  in my opinion  but other servers seemed just fine. The reason this place gets one star is because both me and my friend had indigestion problems afterwards. For myself  I know that the chicken bacon ranch pizza is the only thing I ate that day  so I can pinpoint the source of my troubles. I didn't go in with the intention to pay for the privilege of going to the restroom every two hours  but that's exactly how my night turned out.
Tabitha Y.,Hacienda Heights  CA,425,20,12,3/21/2016,4.0,"I\'ve been to BJs quite a lot and I was always \'whatever\' about it. The food was \'eh\' and overpriced. But I did come back recently with a friend for dinner and it was quite different from my other experiences. On the day we went  a waitress offered us a slice of their deep dish pizza for free while we were waiting to get seated. I can\'t really explain it but the pizza was BOMB. That was something they\'ve never done before which was really nice to see! The waiters that served us were very friendly! The food is still overpriced. I think most of the dinner plates were around $14-$16 each. I was going to order their shrimp and asparagus pene (I think that\'s what it was called) but after I saw the price  I was like ""hell no"". So I ordered their 10 bone in chicken wings. The chicken wings were actually pretty good! I think next time we\'ll be going during lunch hour or happy hour because it\'s cheaper than dinner."
Gabby A.,La Puente  CA,37,26,20,4/30/2015,5.0,My hubby  our friends and myself come here on a weekly basis  the servers are very friendly and always go a good job. Because we are regulars they already know what we order. The food is always tasty.
Jason S.,Ontario  CA,2,12,2,7/24/2015,3.0,I went here for lunch while was car was being serviced at nissan. The food and service was good; but  my pizza came late. So they offered me a dissert. But as I was eating my pizza I bit into a piece of plastic. On the plus side they comped my whole meal. I know stuff happens and I will still come again
Loretta R.,Whittier  CA,10,103,12,1/1/2014,2.0,Food was great!Service and servers are inexperienced and slow.This would not be a bjs location to visit. Most likely I would not return here again or recommend this location to others.
Little S.,Schenectady  NY,3,106,5,9/27/2015,3.0,I went here with a couple Christian friends once several years ago. It was decent. No coupons or anything though. :(
Steven D.,Whittier  CA,7,65,10,5/25/2015,4.0,Bjs style of Chicago pizza is really good. I love the stewed tomatoes the their pizza sauce. Overall the service is always good and the food standard is maintained.
Tricia G.,Miami  FL,183,109,148,8/29/2011,4.0,BJ's is a great place to hang out with large groups of friends and family.  The place can get a bit on the loud side at times (especially when a game is on)  so it wouldn't make for a romantic setting for you and your honey. The service is usually on the good side - the waiters make sure your drinks are filled at all times and it's a plus when they don't roll their eyes when you ask for separate checks!From the pizzas  to chicken wings  to pastas  to sandwiches - the food is good. Decent. A-OK. I usually order the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (creamy pasta dish with bacon and LOTS of shrimp)  and I was pretty bummed when I found out that they no longer have that dish on the menu. Their avocado egg rolls are delicious as well! Aside from the deep dish pizzas  BJ's is known for their beer and pizookies!!! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizookies (soft cookie baked in a small deep dish pizza pan with ice cream on top)! Whether it's the chocolate chip pizookie  white chocolate chip pizookie  black and white (half chocolate/half white chocolate) or the delicious red velvet pizookie - you CANNOT and SHOULD NOT leave the restaurant without having a pizookie for dessert!!!
Abe A.,Walnut  CA,0,2,2,4/8/2016,5.0,WOW! My wife and I had date night at BJ's near puente hills mall on Friday night. It was crowded (as expected for the weekend) however we were able to find the last two seats available on the bar because we did not want to wait for a table. They were lowered and near the kitchen so it was awkward at first for us  but the moment our server  Michael  greeted us he made us feel so welcome and I knew he would take good care of my wife and I. He checked on us constantly  even though it was extremely busy  and made sure we got everything we asked for. At the end of our date  he mentioned a rewards card that we can sign up for and all the benefits of having it. We gladly signed up for it and will definitely be coming back to redeem all our rewards. Thanks Michael for making my date night wonderful!!! BJ's rocks!
Cesar R.,San Diego  CA,82,44,2,9/6/2013,1.0,I guess it's ok for this establishment to serve their customers with dirty dishes and give vegetables that weren't washed properly(it still had dirt on it). Last time I checked   this is a health code violation. Spoke to mgr  she just took the dirty plates . Service was horrible  server only came by 2x's and then on my bill they suggest 15% or 20% tip. Really for shitty service you expect 15 or 20% tip? You lost your damn mind.Not coming back to this place again!
Jaqlyn G.,Somset  United Kingdom,0,3,,10/5/2016,1.0,"First off let me start by saying the service was horrible from the time we got seated until walking out of the doors. The only ""good"" thing was us not having to wait long for a table. Everything after that was HORRIBLE. EDWARD G  our server  would throw down his notepad on our table while we are ordering & roll his eyes. Then while my friends & I would be in a conversation & EDWARD would come by it\'s like he would get angry & flip his hand then walk away. We had to ask for EVERYTHING (refills  napkins  utensils  refills AGAIN) it was really unpleasant for him to even come to our table at all. Finally we waited for our check & that was a whole 20-30 minutes more of my time wasted!! Finally when we go to pay they end up charging our card the wrong amount. They claimed they voided the transaction but that was all of the money we had on the card & they said the money would not come back to the card for a few days. Sooooooo how are we supposed to pay? The manager said the card would get declined & stated she didn\'t know how we are supposed to pay & it has NOHING to do with them. She basically said it\'s your problem  figure it out. Did she forget THEY charged US the wrong amount?? We never consented to that amount. By the way we arrived no later than 9:30pm the time was already 11:45pm & they close at 12 am....... LUCKILY a friend was there to spot our group. I regret not just walking out. This was the worst of the worst experience I have ever had my whole life!!!!!!! NEVER EVER GO HERE!!! 0 STARS!!!!!! Manager was a Caucasian with blond hair & no customer service for the life of her  too bad I forgot her name."
James O.,Riverside  CA,1,17,5,8/28/2015,2.0,"Lawrence was rude. He also seemed rude and abrupt with his other tables also. I\'m sure if you actually got a decent waiter/waitress you may have a good meal here. I frequent Brea BJ\'s and never have issues. But he walked up said my name is Lawrence I\'ll be serving you. Anything to drink?. I asked of there was a happy hour and he said ""oh well idk.. oh yea there is but I would have to go get you a different menu."" Sorry to be such an inconvenience to you. If you don\'t like your job gtfo. There\'s plenty of people who will gladly be pleasant at their job. I\'d give 1 star but the guy who brought out the waters was genuine and nice just bringing out water."
Christine K.,Los Angeles  CA,298,712,479,7/15/2011,3.0,So odd...I've never really had any problems at BJ's except for the long wait...at least the ones in Irvine  Cerritos  and Brea.I heard they opened up a couple new Bjs...one in RH and Santa Monica(?).I see now that's it's technically in the City of Industry? Whatever  I'll still call it RH.Either way  I read how people were unhappy with the slow service here  but I didn't really care...how long can a beer order take? hahaI got here around 8pm on a Wed night.I think there might have been a 15min wait for a table  which is not bad at all.But the bar was pretty empty  which is great!We order and yes...I already noticed frustrated people around me.Some even just left.Come on people...this is a brewery...relax~ have a beer! hahaha(But I've had those days too where I just can't wait and just so angry I walked out :/)The server did come over and apologize for the wait.I asked her if they had any bread since we were drinking on an empty stomach and she brought us some warm chips and salsa. =)By the time we finished the chips and salsa  our food was out.So it took about an hour.Overall I don't like the setup and vibe as much as Brea's location.
Jorge S.,Riverside  CA,3,10,88,5/3/2015,4.0,Deep dish pizza. In house beers. Wash  rinse  repeat. Maybe it's the nostalgia factor that causes me to be so fond of this place. I know there's tons of smaller pizzerias that will make them as good if not better but being able to walk to to the bar and ordering a deep dish and a delicious beer to go along with it...hard to beat anywhere. The rest of their menu is comparable to any of the other larger mainstays so there's not much to say there except...deep dish pizza  in house beers.
Jennifer O.,Los Angeles  CA,326,139,112,3/22/2014,5.0,*Happy Hour Review.*Just went here for happy hour on a Friday evening at around 5:00 P.M.Likes:-Friendly and quick service.-I got the strawberry mojito. It was delicious  made just right (with the right amount alcohol content)  and the cup size was fairly big.-Prices are reasonable. Everything is around $4-$6 or so. -My friends and I shared the spinach and artichoke dip and it was good.-Great place to relax  talk and watch games (They have a few big screen tv's). -Ample parking in parking lot.Dislikes:-Pretty crowded. You can only sit in the bar area so there is a limited number of tables and chairs. Not the best for big parties. -Not the biggest variety of happy hour foods and drinks. Recommend:Yes.
Mimi C.,Arlington  VA,811,2310,472,7/3/2011,2.0,"Meh. . . I love BJ\'s Brewery! It\'s my favorite American eatery but man  I wish it were better here!Always on the order are sliders ... I love theirs the most  but this BJ\'s had dry patties and so so buns. Plus  no side of fries! Apparently  you can get it free w/o charge if you ask for it. So ask! They used to just give it to you as part of the meal. Beef to Bun ratio was not good either. What happened  BJ\'s??Also ordered the thai shrimp wraps... must\'ve had too much something in that sauce cuz hubby and I were both drinking tons of water after the meal and after we left. The saver was the combo pizza. It wasn\'t too greasy. Service was okay... it was really crowded on Saturday evening so I guess that was expected. .... about parties ... they do not have a more private/separate room for larger parties. We were sitting next to a table where people were getting really loud cuz they were sloshed. -____-"" We were okay with it  but felt kinda bad for the people with kids sitting around those tables.  ... I may be back for their $5.95 lunch specials though.We were both saying how this BJ\'s has about 50% asians in it lol. Not a bad thing  just that every other one we\'ve been to the percentage has been less."
Lisa H.,Redondo Beach  CA,16,760,154,2/13/2014,3.0,Good service and happy hour specials. The food  though  always depend on the location  and this one was ok: pretty standard and nothing special. We had the ahi tuna appetizer and the tuna doesn't seem or taste that fresh. We also had a burger  and that was pretty good.
Yard B.,Rowland Heights  CA,0,170,,8/10/2015,4.0,First time to BJ's in City of Industry. Our food came fast and was very tasty and good  we ordered Fried Calamari  sheared Ahi Tuna salad and North Shore Mahi Mahi with shrimp and the baked chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream. Our server's name is Katy and she deserves five stars  she made sure everything was ok  refilled our water and checked on us several times. You rarely find servers like her who work hard for you these days.Pretty cool place to eat and have a drink  I'd eat here again.
Thanh S.,West Covina  CA,3,15,1,2/24/2016,1.0,Don't order the unlimited soup and salad meal. I didn't get my 2nd salad for another 20-30 mins. Bill came out fast though.
Jackie R.,West Covina  CA,407,364,643,6/16/2012,3.0,"Pretty good food  but it depends on what you order and when. I really love the Piranhe Pale Ale Nachos. I think that\'s what they\'re called. lol They are REALLY good. Of course there\'s also the famous Pizoockie.Other than that  the food ranges from okay to good. Their alcoholic drinks are pretty good and there\'s a fairly new non-alcoholic beverage called ""Orange Twist"" that I like a lot.I don\'t know what happened to my favorite grilled cheese sandwich to go with the tomato bisque? Boo!!!!!!! How dare you take that off the menu! I taketh one star away!The service is okay  nothing special. Overall  not a bad place to have lunch or dinner."
Alice C.,Pomona  CA,1,18,11,6/1/2014,1.0,I like BJ's except this location-City of Industry. My family and I went to this location many times  front servicer always are WORSE. That front girl told me to wait 20 mins  but we waited 45 mins for 4 ppl seat  and her attitude wasn't very nice. It make us a bad impression. Another BJ's locations that services and food are good.
Bryant L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,9,9,7,10/23/2014,4.0,I have only been to this restaurant a few time the food is great! The service is ok and the price range is a bit high but overall I like this restaurant. I really enjoy their pizza and if you haven't tried the pazooki you're missing out it's an excellent way to end your meal!
Jett R.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,2,,7/21/2015,2.0,Great food  the people working in the kitchen get it right every time. The service is the only problem. Hosts and hostesses differ  but they're real sensitive. SOME of the servers are rude  slow  and expect a good tip for it. For example  Edward G served us and he was the rudest waiter I've ever had. EVER. He was flirting with the hostess instead of bringing our drinks. He made the woman in my party very uncomfortable. He threw our To-go boxes on the table. He didn't even bring out our food or give us refills! But the ravioli was great! Great televisions! Take a chance on this place at your own discretion!
Gary W.,Brea  CA,1836,140,696,2/18/2014,4.0,Great food and beer. Love their deep dish pizza. If you like alcohol  they've huge selection of beer. Service is not bad  server is friendly and attentive. Huge screen tv everywhere  it's great if you like to watch sports. Great place to host your business or birthday dinner. The parking is pretty bad during weekend.
jackie l.,La Habra  CA,0,1,,3/24/2016,5.0,My son offered to pick up our dinner tonight but when I tried to order online the southern fried chicken wasn't on the menu. When I called a really nice lady assured me she could get it for me and I then ordered our 3 entries and soup. When my son got home he raved about the speed of the order and friendliness of the staff. We can do this more often now that he is so pleased. Thanks to your staff and your cooks.  I love the chicken dinner
Mary W.,Long Beach  CA,22,73,,6/22/2013,4.0,My family and I went here for dinner after a certain fiasco in my other same day review  and overall it was a pretty solid experience.The waitress and/or cook forgot to add on chicken on my husband's pasta dish. But the waitress was courteous and brought him a nice sized side  and did not add it to the bill.The service was great. My particular dish  the creole tilapia  left a lot to be desired  but it was certainly edible. That's the reason for four stars. We had a good time.
Ivy W.,Los Angeles  CA,1521,1308,2750,4/25/2013,2.0,Since this BJ's isn't too far from my work  I decided to order online and take advantage of their curbside service. Their online menu wasn't very organized nor easy to read  but that isn't this location's fault.I decided to get the Cajun Pasta -- fettuccini noodles tossed in a creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast  fire-roasted red peppers  red onions  and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions. Sounds tasty  right?The pasta wasn't bad  tasty even; but after picking it up and taking it back to the office to devour  I was shocked to see how tiny the portion was. Maybe it was because the plastic take-out plate was huge  but the pasta barely covered it at a thin layer. For $12  it was really pathetic and disappointing. Either use smaller packaging or don't skimp out on noodles! Pasta noodles aren't even expensive...I won't be back.
Link Z.,Hacienda Heights  CA,3,16,5,4/16/2015,1.0,My last 3 visits to this BJ's have been so disappointing  usually an hour before closing. The staff looks less than pleased to help. They're flat out annoyed. Tonight was my last time for a long while. My friend and I waited a good while before the waitress walked over (a heavy set girl with a blonde ponytail). All she said was she'd bring back menus and when she brought them back  she set them down and proceeded to walk away before taking our drink order. My friend started to ask her for something as she walked away. She snapped at him  held her hand to his face  and told him to hold on. We were speechless. We got up and left and went to BWW down the street. This is the last time we go to this BJ's  at least until there's a better staff happy to help.
Vanessa M.,Baldwin Park  CA,212,14,1,3/15/2015,4.0,Sooooooo came here yesterday with Co workers about 7:00 pm. Knowing how it's been pretty hot lately we thought inside would be nice. Took about 40 minutes to be seated (party of 11) and when we got our seats inside it was very stuffy and hot inside. Turns out the AIR CONDITIONER is broken. Omgsh we weren't seated even 15 minutes and we were all complaining about the heat. Luckily we talked to the hostess and were about to get seated outside. Service was great and so was the food but i would head to a different bjs if it being stuffy/hot inside is going to bother you. 4 stars is because the Ac was broken or else it would of been 5.
Heidi S.,San Francisco  CA,195,32,,9/23/2013,3.0,NOT Chicago style deep dish pizza.With that said  the pizza still tastes fine. I just don't think they should advertise it as deep dish because it tastes like regular Pizza Hut pan pizza with more dough. We ordered 2 medium pizzas (BJ's Favorite and Great White)  1 order of nachos  1 pitcher of beer  and 1 pizookie platter. It was a good amount for 6 people  but if you were feeling hungry  I think you can order an extra appetizer.The place was really busy  but our server checked up on us often.I had a great time with friends  but an OK time with the food. Meh.
Kelsey W.,Los Angeles  CA,178,227,18,12/27/2013,4.0,I'm a fan of BJs  and this location is just fine! For a restaurant chain  BJs is one of my favorite  with a wide variety of menu items and tasty food. The service here is only okay though  it's kind of evident that the staff shows up just to show up to work  you know?Anyways  I love getting the grilled chicken pasta and pretty much get this every time I come for dinner. I've also tried their deep dish pizzas  as well as their jambalaya and spaghetti  and some other dishes. As you can tell  this review is a long time coming. The chicken is super moist and flavorful  and they give you a large portion  so I always have some left for a second meal. I wish they gave more broccoli... but I digress.They have a good variety of beers on tap too - well  granted  they should  as a brewery! I also love coming to BJs for the pazookies! These are heaven  and if you haven't tried one  go order one now! It never tastes the same when you try to make it at home.
Gil M.,Riverhead  NY,317,176,362,10/21/2013,3.0,Short-n-Sweet: craft beer selection decent  bulist the list of them is incorrect; extremely dim lighting all day; a smaller locationSTORY-TIME:Let me at the very least say that I'm happy BJ's exists in the Heights. It's quite possibly the only place to offer craft beer on tap in a 5 mile radius!!I love their food  and it's all very competitive with BWWs and Chili's. It's awesome that there's even a second happy hour! More opportunity to save!However  somethings really got this place into my 3-star category:1) Beer menu sucks. Not the offerings  mind you. They don't have a correct beer menu. Actually it seems no BJ's has a correct beer list. =/2) This place is dim like a bat cave! I had lunch with my dad here and we both thought we were on a date. Lame. Next time we'll choose the patio or even the bar area had more window lighting. 3) Poor training? The waitress didn't know about the special price on BJ's brews for lunch ($3.50 11a-2p)  and didn't know the beers. Still  I'd rather come here than BWW or TGIF for the food and drink selections!
Hanz L.,Placentia  CA,299,356,70,8/5/2013,4.0,There are quite a few things I can complain about here  and all of it would be food. However  parking  service  cleanliness are all good.Instead of complaining about everything  I will tell you instead what I would come here for: Skinny fries  pizooki  and drinks. Their personally crafted sodas are very unique and very refreshing if you come here only once in a while. There are a few decent dishes for an entree  but I think you'll have to find something to your own liking. I had the pasta with a lemon flavored sauce on the chicken and that's worth coming back for.
Eric C.,South Burlington  VT,308,224,315,11/14/2013,3.0,The boyfriend and I came here twice already and I've liked it every single time. BJS has great deals on Thursdays  especially for their happy hour drinks.We usually order an appetizer of the chicken wings and calamari (or chicken wings and a pizza) and that's pretty filling for the both of us.The inside of this specific BJs is a lot less cluttered and feels way more open that most restaurants. The dimly lit ambiance is really nice  especially if you're on a date or trying to go for a more intimate conversation/dinner.The service has always been spot on so I really don't have any complaints about this BJs.
Jay C.,Diamond Bar  CA,63,28,19,10/8/2015,1.0,I do NOT recommend this location  the one in brea is definitely a lot better. We came here with a group of 10/11 people  we asked for ranch for 5 times & they gave us only 2 ranches for 10 people. We asked for napkins 4 times! The server was not doing this job. We asked again because he didn't give it to us after so many times. The young guy server threw the napkins on the like we were dogs and left without saying a word. Our group of 10/11 people noticed immediately and believe we did face some kind of racial discrimination. The food took forever to come out & ask for the check several times. We waited the server to collect our money for 20 mins & he still didn't show up. One of us had to get up & hand it to an employee. We had to do THEIR job. What kind of service is this? What can of attitude is this? At first  we were going to give 15% of tips  however  we did notice all these issues with their rude attitude and terrible service  they didn't deserve it. Me and the group of 10/11 people will NOT be coming back and do not suggest others to.
Jay C.,Hollywood  CA,198,35,50,1/10/2012,4.0,can you say wine and dine..?? Great Happy Hour around..!! Tuesday Wine is Half off.!!
Lorraine S.,Rowland Heights  CA,5,19,,1/19/2016,1.0,My daughter and I have been coming here for years  and the service just keeps getting lousier!! Our last two visits have been the absolute worst. The servers are down right rude and or un-attentive  the prices are pretty steep for the mediocre quality of food. I am done supporting this establishment time to move on.
Kevin P.,Diamond Bar  CA,127,193,83,10/3/2014,2.0,"I like the pizza  beer and pizookies.Usually we come here and get good service  this time service was terrible. We ordered the 2 for $20 meal which had 2 apps  pizza and pizookie. Our waiter was having trouble at another table so he completely forgot about us. Water refills were few and far between. I didnt even have parmesan and red pepper till i was into my second slice. Seems like he was busy with other things. I also ordered a side of fries but got it really late. I use the BJ\'s app on my phone so I can see when an order has been placed for me in real time. I checked the app and the side of fries wasnt on there. After many tries  i was able to flag down the waiter to ask for the fries. He said ""Oh they must have forgotten it."" He walks over to his station then surprise surprise all of a sudden i see the order of fries on my bill in my app. Did they forget to bring it out or did he forget to place the order for me. You be the judge. I\'ll still come back here. I just hope I\'m not in that waiters section anymore."
Raymond R.,San Dimas  CA,670,428,411,3/1/2011,2.0,40 minutes to make a freakn pazookie?? Really?? I can understand if our waiter had to run to mrs. Fields and Dairy Queen at puente hills mall to get some cookies and ice cream from there  but I don't think that's the case.A family sitting next to us got there after us  ordered a pizza and some other food and STILL got their food before us.I never say no to BJ's.. and probably will keep coming back after this experience.. But gotta step up the speed on making pazookies!
Elix C.,Los Angeles  CA,2,20,,2/1/2015,4.0,I came here for a family dinner and was attended by a real good waiter. His name is Angel. This guy knows what being a server is all about. He constantly checked on us. But what I really liked was that the plate I ordered was pretty bland and I only took 2 bites and set it aside. Angel noticed this right away and immediately offered to get me something else. I declined and said thank you. He came back 5 minutes later and said that he removed it from my bill. This is great service. Would definitely go here again.
John B.,West Covina  CA,0,2,,2/12/2016,1.0,Worst service ever. Our host seated us 30 minutes ago and no one has even come to take our order. Wanted to leave when the wait went from 30 to 45 minutes but my boyfriend really wanted a pizookie. I will never come back again
Brandon M.,Fullerton  CA,24,151,7,1/4/2014,3.0,"I normally go to a BJ\'s that\'s closer to my house. But I was in the area today and thought I would try this one out. For a Saturday night  me and my date were seated rather quickly (which was good). It didn\'t take long at all to get the food ball rolling  in terms of waitress service. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. The meal went well  and I didn\'t have any problems. Over all  it was an ""A-OK"" experience.The reason I don\'t give it 4 or 5 star is because the atmosphere is bland  too many ghetto people  and the food was good - but not ""great"" as I get at my normal location. It was still a decent spot  and probably more tolerable for the ghetto residents of Industry - It just didn\'t hit home for me. Over all  it didn\'t let me down though. I may not choose to go to this specific location again anytime soon  but at least I know its an option in the event I am struck with extreme hunger and am local to this spot."
Cella W.,Newport Beach  CA,39,84,32,12/13/2014,4.0,BJs is BJs..you know what to expect  drinks are good  food is good! The server was very patience with our party of 8 with 3 small children! Overall good!
Chel R.,Hacienda Heights  CA,10,700,4395,12/12/2010,4.0,This is officially my third time at a BJs and my first time at this location. Its in my hood and its also CMD's favorite spot. We ordered: the spinach and artichoke dip for appetizer  i had one of their flat bread  margherita fresca which was crispy  very light on the tomato sauce  with tastey sweet basil. We also ordered their chicken parmesan which was indeed amazingly juicy  savory  and flavorful. It certainly was a busy Sunday for them but we were confused as to who our server was. We were approached with one server and he immediately said he was not our 'own' server but he will just go ahead and take our orders. So from bringing us our drinks  refilling our drinks  bringing out our orders  checking up on us  we had a total of FOUR people attending to us. We weren't sure how to feel about it. But I guess as long as we were not neglected  ish all good:)
Aimee M.,West Covina  CA,94,46,5,1/8/2013,5.0,Excellent food  friendly service!I usually go for lunch and get their lunch specials and share appetizers. Here's what to get :For Appetizers ~Avocado Egg RollsAhi Poke Lunch~Black And Bleu Flatbread Pizza & SaladAlso try the Chicken Tortilla soup. It's amazing!
Lana D.,Fontana  CA,81,49,9,10/25/2012,2.0,"Stopped in here with some friends on a Tuesday night  since Buffalo Wild Wings was a no go.Nothing fancy  though slightly pricey. The service was unmentionably slow (which would be understandable if it was a busy night  but we were practically the only table in our server\'s section).Though I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Berry Sweet Limeade "" I would have loved it even more if the server refilled my glass.The table ordered some drinks  pizza  burgers  and wings. Average on all accounts."
Summer S.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,0,2,3,9/25/2014,1.0,"I have dined at this location before and I was disappointed then (was served and ate off of a dirty spoon disguised as clean..yuck) so I hadn\'t been back in a while. I finally came back today to watch Thursday Nite Football and also partake in the advertised ""Party for Two"" deal which included a choice between soup or salad  1 medium pizza and 1 Pizookie to share for $22. My party also ordered some drinks and 2 orders of chicken wings from the Happy Hour menu. Usually the wings are fried and tossed in the selected sauce (in this case  my party chose Garlic Parmesan and BBQ). For some reason  we received the wings with the sauce on the side. I\'m not sure if this offering is a new way for BJ\'s to serve the wings or if our server made a mistake  but we did not like the way the wings were served at all. The rest of the food (and the drinks) were also mediocre--nothing to scream about--including the \'new\' Peanut Butter S\'more Pizookie which sounded interesting upon ordering  but was not tasty. I know everyone is usually disappointed when the bill arrives  but I was extremely disappointed because my party was overcharged. It looked like we were charged for each item ordered a la carte instead of the $22 price that we were expecting. After pointing this out to our new server  we received the revised bill with the corrected amount and then requested the server to split the bill between the debit cards for each of us. We all received and signed our individual receipts showing the split charges  however  a few hours after leaving the restaurant  I noticed a charge on my account from BJ\'s for the full amount of my party\'s total bill--not the split amount that was on the receipt that I signed. I called the BJ\'s location and spoke with the manager (Melissa) who voided the incorrect charge on my card and replaced it with the correct charge that I authorized earlier in the restaurant. I did receive an apology but I wanted to document this for BJ\'s Corporate and unfortunately enter my first negative review on Yelp because I was definitely dissatisfied--again. I do not feel comfortable patronizing this location--or a BJ\'s--again."
Jeanette D.,La Puente  CA,58,28,26,11/11/2014,5.0,Awesome service especially after coming from the montebello one. I usually go to this location and they always have amazing food and service. My favorites are their California burger  parmesan crusted chicken  bjs pizza  the wings  and my ultimate favorite their Oreo cookie pazooki :Q___ They have a good selection of alcohol and yummy appetizers to go with them. Another thing that I love about this location is that it's not always packed with people or loud. I totally recommend coming to this Bjs!
Stacy C.,Walnut  CA,742,733,1239,12/9/2010,5.0,It's nice to have a BJ's around here then having to drive all the way to Brea to come to a joint like this. And I must say that the decor is just fabulous. I love the spinning doors that they have at the front!Came here on a Saturday for lunch and upon going in we were greeted quite graciously by the hostess at the front desk. We were seated accordingly  though I wished they they had given us one of those small booths so I didn't have to sit diagonally from my boyfriend. It was very uncomfortable when want to talk to him  I had to turn sideways.But the service was what sold me on giving them five stars. Our waitress (oh  I wish I remembered her name!) was very polite and very knowledgeable when we asked her what she thought was the best food on the menu since neither of us had really eaten at BJ's before except my occasional trip there to eat their poozkies. We decided to order their deep dish pizza and asked if it was possible not to add cheese on it because my boyfriend was lactose. She suggested a few alternatives for us to make our pizza taste better. She let us choose having only half our pizza be topped with cheese and the other half added with more tomatoes. We also ordered a Shrimp Bruschetta without cheese. Our bruschetta came out first and upon inspecting it  I realized that they had added cheese on our order. I started picking it out instead of having them needing to remake a new one. When coming to check up on us  our waitress saw and deeply apologized even though she had told the kitchen no cheese. She immediately told us that they'll make new ones for us and took our old one back.In the end  I was really pleased on the service and their food was pretty exceptional (the deep dish mushroom pizza is to die for! It just melts in your mouth and the bread is just the perfect softness!). They'll definitely be expecting me for more future visits! (:
Dan Y.,Cheviot Hills  CA,0,117,,11/21/2012,2.0,This review is specifically for weekday lunch at this location.The lunch choices at BJ's is very reasonable priced  good flavor  with decent portion sizes. With the usual pizza selection  they also have lunch specials like chicken tacos  and all you can eat soup & salad. Also  many of the beers at $3.50 during lunch. If I were rating just the food and pricing  it'd be a strong 3.5 stars.That being said  the service here at lunch is ATROCIOUS. If you have limited time to eat your food and need to head to the office  either get your food to-go or go somewhere else. I've been here at least five times on various occasions for lunch and the service is soooooooooo slow. Management at this location needs to realize that for lunch  many people need to get in and out faster than they would during dinner service. I can't afford to wait fifteen minutes for a Pizookie  I can't afford to wait ten minutes for a refill of soup  and I sure hell can't wait ten minutes just to get a beer. Get your act together!!!
John L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,3,9,1,4/14/2015,4.0,Overall a good location come like once a month would have put 5star but was one or two occasions they mixed up my order to go.. But other than that great place.
T P.,Orange County  CA,1,503,178,4/14/2016,1.0,I placed a take out order for 11 soups and salads on a Wed afternoon for next day 11:30 am pick up.  I had also placed an order the past Monday for a Tues pick up at the San Bernardino location WITHOUT any issues. I received a call at 11:16 am (14 min before my requested pick up time) stating the order would be on hold because the restaurant has received fraudulent on line orders. I was in a meeting with a customer when this call came in. I called back at 11:23 and confirmed that it was a real order. I arrive to the restaurant  it was completely empty (now I know why). A lady greeted me and went to check on the order. Finally  at 11:38  the order finally comes out. Because of the delay in this order  I was late to my meeting. Everyone was there on time and i was 10 min late. Not a great first impression. An older  short brown haired lady told me to call and confirm my order. I'm suppose to place an order on line and call to confirm it? What's the purpose of on line ordering? Horrible experience.  I made sure to tell her that I would not be coming back.  Unprofessional customer service. I absolutely do not recommend or will I return. Be aware  if your order is over $100  they will hold your order until you call in to confirm it (even if you have a BJ's Premier card number). I order lunch for my customers 2-3 times a week  too bad for BJ's.
Jenny L.,West Covina  CA,101,23,19,10/20/2012,1.0,This past Thursday  I was there with my co-workers. I bought 5 Patron silver Tequila for myself and couple of my friends (each shot cost me $7.00  trust me its a smallest shot I ever seen) and they totally taste water down. After i mention to Byron Barrera . .... he did nothing about it  and then as soon as we try to order more beer  he stop serve to us at 8:30pm...... I will never visit this BJ again. I guess you guys dont care about us...... so why should i give u the business. But i hope you guys will improve in the future for others who is still trying to have fun at BJs.
Jimmy H.,Buena Park  CA,937,444,757,3/1/2013,3.0,I would put them on par with places like Cheesecake Factory. Food and service is always consistent. I do like their pizza (good selection and quality) and the selection of spirits. We have a very nice waitress today and her service was A plus.
Susanna H.,Hacienda Heights  CA,21,5,7,7/6/2014,2.0,Went there with my kid for a late lunch the food was ok and the waitress walk by us twice with water but never refill our cup or even a courtesy to asked if we need more water  for the whole meal we only had ONE cup of water... We still tip her 15% but in my head I can just walk out without giving her any tips..
Dennis R.,La Puente  CA,2,32,,12/24/2014,3.0,Came in today for a few drinks with my girlfriend and had an off experience.When we got here  we decided to sit at the bar since it was empty. We were promptly greeted by Mika (not sure of the spelling). She was friendly and took our order. She had our drinks and food brought quickly. Which was good since the bar was empty. Within the 15-20 minutes  she must of checked on us 3-4 times. This was great. But then she had to leave and switched off with Edward.He was a terrible waiter. He never checked on us. We left our drinks at 1/3 capacity and he never came over. He passed by our table many times  looked in our direction and kept walking. It wasn't until 10 minutes after we BOTH finished our drinks until he spoke to us. We were hoping to have a few drinks but by then  forget it. We asked for the check and left.This is not usual of the experience at BJ's. I cant say it was because it was packed because it wasn't. There was maybe 20 people total.
Matthew R.,West Covina  CA,194,558,198,6/29/2013,4.0,BJs is a great dependable spot to grab a few appetizers and some great craft beer. The avocado egg rolls are always a must.
Tina V.,City of Industry  CA,313,448,653,6/11/2011,1.0,food is oily  heavy and salty in this locations and services is beyond horrible. you would expect decent services for a new restaurant.  Took 20mins to take my order and 45 mins to bring the order and the beer was warm... for a chain bj is suppose to be good for beer. i think ill stick to the west covina or brea location at least the beer and food is more average comparable than here.
William C.,Rowland Heights  CA,23,7,,3/9/2013,1.0,I need to leave a post it in my car reminding me why I shouldn't come here anymore. I've been here for different occasions and it has always been a terrible experience. Recently came here for lunch  decide to sit at the bar since it was pretty empty. Ordered a pitcher of their phiranna  shrimp pasta  mozzarella sticks  and a Pizza. I've had the phiranna at brea and it was amazing. At this location it tasted completely different. Super bitter and it didn't have that sweet after taste it usually does. Food took about half an hour to come out. For being so empty I figured it'd come out alot quicker. Waitress was too busy chatting up with her friends in the table behind ours. By the time the food came out it was cold. The pizza was cold  pasta had cold spots  and we never even got our mozerlla sticks. Whats the point of ordering an appetizer and get it as desert? We ended up cancelling it. This is the only time I've ever not left a tip. Maybe the food taking forever wasn't our waitresses fault but she sure as hell didnt do anything about it since she was too busy conversating. If you're considering coming here do yourself a favor and make the extra drive to the brea location. This Bj's just has nothing good about it.
Kristina V.,New York  NY,46,122,22,5/28/2013,5.0,I went for brunch last weekend and had the breakfast pizza and we had an amazing flatbread for an appetizer. My bf got the steak salad. All of it was so good. The service was good too. Great prices too. The menu seemed to go on and one. It reminded me of The Cheesecake Factory. I want to go again for the infamous pizouki (sp?) o_O
Ashley H.,La Habra  CA,36,54,21,10/21/2014,5.0,All I have to say is get JEFF as a server and you will never be disappointed. He has saved the night numerous times. He is the best. The food is good and we love trying new things.
Jo L.,Covina  CA,88,275,38,12/6/2012,2.0,Parking is terrible. their drinks are absolutely nasty. i had their strawberry something cocktail. my friends got coke and iced tea. all of them are diluted. gross.our server was so out of it. he knocked over something a few times  dropped our silverware while cleaning our table before dessert. one of the knife dropped on my friend! thank god it was only a butter knife. what if it was a steak knife?!no one was hurt but still. he apologized but that was it. he didnt do anything to make up the messed he made. not even a scoop of ice cream for my poor friend. lol
Samuel L.,Los Angeles  CA,90,166,6,8/29/2012,2.0,I've just never been a fan of the food from this franchise.I was going to award this specific location 3 stars but our server made a huge mistake and dishonest mistake that I will talk about later. quickly:If you want to go somewhere to grab a drink for happy hour then I would recommend this place. HOWEVER  the food is barely mediocre and overpriced. I'm a pretty health conscious person so if you are calorie counting don't come here. Everything is made of carbs here and is not very helpful with their healthier options. In my recent visit I ordered:flatbread pizzamozzarella and tomato saladand a Chimay WhiteThe beer was great! except that they don't make it so no stars for that. The flatbread isn't bad at all but it does get boring and a bit dry. They can be a little more generous with the toppings IMO. THE BAD PART:I was here for a friends birthday. We finished and when we paid the bill we were short a bit. We all pitched in and we were good. We actually realized there was more money than needed since gratuity was already included. Our server knew that there was more money than needed and I know this because he decided to sit himself down in a seat right next to me organizing the bill. We made eye contact and as I noticed the excess money  he literally snatched the
Johnson L.,Manhattan  NY,328,519,166,12/28/2010,4.0,Yay because we finally have a BJ's in Rowland Heights and I do not have to drive to Brea for BJ's. Meh because I am not a big fan of BJ's food - gets old fast and there is not anything special about their dishes. The environment is nice and this BJ's is super big! It gets super busy too though.It is a nice place to hang out. My girlfriend and I got the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp - it was too oily and honestly nothing special (3/5). The service here is pretty good. So I give it a 4/5 for a nice group dinner  but a 3/5 for its food. 4/5 for its service
Al L.,Whittier  CA,2,12,1,8/6/2014,1.0,Went here last night 8/5 around 9:30 in the evening. I'm glad I ate dinner first and went to the bathroom second. The server Kenny was excellent  covering for a table that wasn't his. Food was good. Then  I decided to go to the bathroom.Trash is overflowing  wadded up paper towels tracked out into the hallway. Counters covered in water and soap  dripping onto the floors. In this condition  I have to doubt that the employees have clean hands. Skipping desert.At a minimum  a lavatory should be wiped down and re-stocked once per hour. It looks like this went for several hours  or all day. This is definitely a management issue that shouldn't be ignored.We won't come back to this location.
Stephanie B.,Glendora  CA,0,6,,2/24/2015,5.0,My husband and I went to this BJ's for Valentine's Day and we got the best server ever! He was so accommodating  very attentive  yet let us have our own space all in one. The appetizer we got were Chicken tenders trenched in buffalo sauce with skinny french fries. And for our main meal we got the Pepperoni Extreme Pizza. To top that off we got the chocolate chip pizookie for our dessert! :) Yummy! ^_^
Gavin P.,Walnut  CA,45,4,1,4/26/2014,1.0,Horrible service. My friend got over charged on his check. Our drinks never got refilled. Our orders were wrong. They had short staffing on a Saturday night. Not coming back here.
Debora S.,Walnut  CA,15,67,1,7/26/2013,5.0,I've been to this location a few times and every time I've been there....it's been awesome!!! Just a few weeks ago  my boyfriend and I went for dinner and we literally had the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. Yes  BEST.SERVICE.EVER! I wish I remembered her name cause we went back just a couple of nights ago. It was okay because we had another awesome experience. We sat at the bar this time and the bartender dude was so nice  helpful  and totally on top of his game. I loved it. This location sure knows how to provide incredible service!
B C.,Temple City  CA,2,23,2,7/27/2014,1.0,I knew there was a reason why I did not like this BJ's. Every time I try them for to go they messed the orders up entirely. I simply asked for my meal not to have any pickles on it and they put extra pickles on it. Now they're telling me it's going to be another 20 minutes of wait time for them to fix it right very frustrating.
Lyndsey D.,Walnut  CA,0,16,,1/3/2016,4.0,I picked up lunch To-go from here yesterday. The woman on the phone was very pleasant and ordering was quick and easy. When I got my food they packed plates as well for the pizza which I thought was nice. The food was good  I had ordered the bjs favorite  five meat  and sweet pig pizzas. The bjs favorite had so many toppings  too many olives for me but I just picked it off. The sweet pig was my favorite out of the three. Bjs favorite and five meat tasted very similar.
Vanessa C.,Irvine  CA,246,285,33,8/28/2012,2.0,"I do not go to BJ\'s often and there\'s a reason why. In my opinion  the food doesnt live up to its expectations  and I do not have a reason to go back again. Today I had dinner with my boyfriend  Tuesday night at around 6:30  and there was no wait. We were quickly seated to our cute two person seat. Right next to us  there was a ""bachelorette"" party going on. A dinner of about 15 ladies in their 20\'s. They were crazy. And throughout my dinner  they were driving me nuts. Why doesn\'t BJ\'s have a special room for them? I\'m trying to have a nice dinner myself  I do not appreciate the loud drunk ladies throwing a semi party. We ordered the avocado egg rolls and the BBQ chicken pizza. But guess what. They gave us the wrong pizza. Our waitress was very.. kurt. No words really. Short answers. And obviously did not hear our order correctly. We were hungry  so we dug in. The egg rolls were dry  stuffed with avocado  and nothing else. What about some carrots  onions  some seasoning? Nothing. Very disappointed appetizer. These egg rolls are much better at California Pizza Kitchen. The pizza  was also very disappointing. Instead of the BBQ we ordered  we were given Buffalo something... and it tasted weird. Awkward  as if I was eating buffalo wings on my pizza. Not very good at all. I was a little disgusted with the food to even get dessert  a pizookie. Which was the main reason I wanted BJ\'s tonight. We ended up paying very little tip for the poor service  and incorrect order of pizza. I still have never tried a pizookie. But even then  I will try the dessert and only the dessert. I will not be wasting my time eating their dinners. I\'ll be happily at California Pizza Kitchen  or the Cheesecake Factory."
Kris C.,Corona  CA,43,151,31,8/10/2013,4.0,The food was fret  I've never got anything but pizza and I created my own. I reserved a strawberry patch (I think it's the name) the drink was really strong and the flavor was a little off  I got a soda after instead. Our first waiter didn't seem to be to happy to be working  he didn't seem like he had a good attitude. A female took over for him  she said he was going on break but we still saw him working. She was friendly but maybe asked a few times to many if we were doing okay... We will be back!
Summer S.,Los Angeles  CA,54,676,3,7/20/2013,5.0,Amazing service & great prices for HH!!!We came on the 4th of July and ended up coming at the right time -- it was HAPPY hour! We were very pleased with our drinks and food...and the smiles/great personality shown to us by our server! For what we ordered  we got full for low prices. (pizza  avocado eggrolls  and 2 rounds of beer)We will definitely be back.. :) Good job  RH BJ's!
janis c.,Covina  CA,2,9,,6/11/2014,5.0,I was there Sunday morning with my family . We had a lovely server named Desiree . She was attentive  patient  fast  and was extremely polite. We had an enjoyable meal with excellent service. We will be her new regulars every Sunday. We've been there in the past but we have never experienced such a delightful young lady as Desiree !!!!!!
Janet B.,La Puente  CA,4,33,38,10/9/2014,4.0,Love them traditional hit wings. Always crispy and hot. Besides them I enjoy the avocado rolls..delish. But my dish for tonight was the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. OMG  if you like these flavors these tacos hit the spot. I ask for fries on the side instead of the salad. Just enough healthy n bad.
M P.,Pomona  CA,45,152,83,5/2/2012,1.0,Horrible Service. We went when it wasn't busy. We were seated and our waitor dissappeared. It took almost half an hour to get asked if we wanted anything to drink. Then.. they take forever to bring out drinks....A different server takes our order  and once again it takes forever. They bring our orders at very different times  so when we got our food  our friends were almost done with theirs.The FOOD: I ordered the TILAPIA and the rice was HARD and stale. I had to hit it with my fork a few times to loosen it up. No joke.The FISH AND CHIPS were overbattered and extremely salty. The only thing that was good was the tortilla soup. We asked 3 different people for Tabasco sauce because the previous 2 had forgotten....Our cups needed to be refilled and we were not asked for refills until we were done with our food and about to leave. The WHOLE time we had different servers (4) and were very confused.Bottom Line: POOR MANAGEMENT. FOOD NEEDS SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT.
Angela A.,Hacienda Heights  CA,292,40,27,11/1/2014,5.0,The food was super delicious  and our waiter Michael was super attentive! Great service  he was super funny and caring  and the food was all amazing!
Hideki F.,Diamond Bar  CA,201,24,1,8/11/2014,4.0,"Went in with a party of 4 on Saturday night. I called to see what the wait was and found out that they have a call-ahead list  so I put my name on it. Within 5-10mins I was sat  and our server Norman was incredibly helpful. He gave some wonderful ""secret menu"" (modified) suggestions  and had refills coming non-stop. I definitely would ask for Norman again the next time I go in to eat."
Elias S.,Downtown  Los Angeles  CA,8,43,,10/21/2014,3.0,I sometimes come here for a beer and appetizers with my girlfriend. It;s not a bad place but sometimes gets so crowded that is annoying to wait for a table. The food is great tho.
Jenny S.,West Covina  CA,122,67,2,2/16/2012,2.0,THIS BJ'S SUCKED. The service was TERRIBLE. They sat us in and gave us menus..... TWENTY MINUTES LATER  NO ONE CAME TO TAKE OUR ORDER OR EVEN BOTHERED TO CHECK ON US.... THIRTY MINUTES LATER  NOTHING. THE TWO PPL BEHIND US EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING BUT THEY LEFT AFTER 20 MINS.... After finally complaining to one of the waiters  they FINALLY sent a waiter to us and took our orders... Then after apologizing and kissing our asses  we got a free pizookie. If they didn't give us that free pizookie  I'd give this place only one star.
Melissa C.,Anaheim  CA,20,5,3,2/23/2014,1.0,Worst service ever.... Waited 20 minutes for boxes and a pizookie that never came. Waiter came to the table twice... Water never got refilled. Horrible. Would put 0 stars if I could.
Kim N.,San Francisco  CA,806,353,545,4/4/2012,2.0,Chicken fried steak is really dry! Don't order!
Diana H.,Baldwin Park  CA,576,699,1404,11/15/2010,3.0,Early October of this year  my girlfriend and I decided to check this BJ's out. It's their 100th store location and I was destined to make myself comfortable in this location. I love their small portions mac and cheese  their pizookies  their drinks  and soups! This is  granted  smaller than the Eastland location  but still nice. It's very crowded there since they definitely hired too many employees. The last time I came was for my sister's 23rd birthday in the same month (October) and she ordered the pizza. I had the chicken  and my mom had the steak. All fantastic tasting. I love the pizza. It's so fluffy and flavorful. You must try it out  if not in this location  then any location would be just as fine. Decor: sexy  especially when you're with the right company (with mugs of beer  cocktail etc)Food: again  flavorful. Do try their pizzas and pizookies. Price: Fair.
Andrea V.,Covina  CA,1,16,2,7/31/2015,1.0,Our waiter had ringworm on his face.  Pretty unsanitary if you ask me.  Also  service was horrible.  Spilled one of our drinks and left us to clean the mess??????
Henry T.,Hacienda Heights  CA,389,63,42,7/9/2014,4.0,Food is always great the front hostess and service is hit or miss. Party for 8 at 8:00pm 30 minute wait? Restaurant is half empty. Love the fresh root beer and Pizookie.
Vargas V.,Norwalk  CA,1,30,7,8/22/2015,2.0,I'm satisfied hunger wise because I was starving when I got here. I've never had a good experience here! Hubby chose to come here for lunch.. They may be all smiles and giggles but the food is NEVER what the menu says. I ordered a pizza with shredded Parmesan and it had cheap powdered cheese WTF?! Don't make scenes anymore  hubby doesn't like it.. But the quality isn't the same as other BJ's brew houses! Oh well  live and learn.. Will contest coming here again! WACALA
Ivy W.,Los Angeles  CA,462,375,844,2/15/2012,3.0,The only variance between this BJ's as opposed to all the others is its service and location. Prices are the same  ambience is the same  food is the same (mediocre at best with the exception of their infamous pizookies). With that said  BJ's is a nice place to chill for lunch and after work. I came here with my coworker for a late dinner  and we were seated right away by a tired (??) waitress who seemed to have no energy at all other than to just ask how many and if we'd like to sit at the bar.Quick run-down? Location: Awkward. Not much parking space. I could imagine it getting packed and for it to be a nightmare to try to find parking during peak hours.Atmosphere: Relaxing  cushion-y booths  dim. Separated from the bar. Food/Price: Very huge menu of food. Extensive menu of alcohol. Decent prices. I had 2 appetizers and a pizookie while my coworker had himself a pizza with a beer. Price came out to be under $40. I had the red velvet pizookie for the first time  and it was...interestingly sweet; the ice cream was undeniably delicious though. Small Cesar salad was a-okay. But there's usually nothing special about salads anywhere anyway.Service: Our waiter liked to socialize  and there's nothing I enjoy more than late night small talk. The only problem was that when he brought me my chicken lettuce wrap  all that came out was the lettuce  dips  and carrots. Was I just supposed to eat the lettuce with carrots and dip 'em in the sauce? I'm not a bunny. My coworker asked him for it  and he seemed genuinely sorry that he didn't notice it earlier.We left close to 1AM which was their closing time  although they did drop off the bill maybe 40 minutes (during our meal) before. I hate being rushed to leave  but I really liked our server so I tipped him a little over $12 (yeah  he was that nice!).Overall  3.5 stars.
Vicki C.,Santa Monica  CA,55,43,2,7/23/2014,5.0,My parents took me here when i was feeling down. An avocado roll  a deep dish pizza  and a chocolate chip Pizooki cheered me right back up. the avocado roll here is better than the one at Cheesecake factory  mainly because of the sauce they give you. Cheesecake factory is thicker and more tangy  while B.J.'s is thinner and not tangy (it looks like soy sauce). Then I got a mini B.J.s special deep dish pizza  its really deep so I only ate half and I was full. It was like a Costco combo pizza  but with a crust thats fully and really fills you up. the chocoolate chip pizooki should just go without saying. Definitely share it  because its a lot of calories!!
Mantis T.,Goodyear  AZ,12,16,10,1/10/2012,1.0,"*** Just the facts here ***The service I\'ve received was horrible! It was all thanks to our server Bruce. I decided to eat here with my wife on my lunch break. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food around 12:15ish. Our food ( 2 orders of chicken quesadillas ) was served to us at 12:42pm ( A lengthy wait  did they have to kill the chicken?). Our server Bruce only came to our table twice  1st time to take our order & the 2nd time to give our check ( we had to flag him down to get the check ). Not once did Bruce come to our table or pass by to check up on  he didn\'t even refill our drinks ( Big taboo for me )! The only employees around us were the bus boys who tried hard not to make eye contact with us. I had to get back to work and we left the establishment at 1:03pm with no tip for our server Bruce. I called the establishment around 3:30pm later in the day and spoke with the manager Tommy. I asked him about the restaurants soda refill policy and he told me that ""it was unlimited refills"". Then  I told Tommy my experience at his restaurant earlier in the day with his employee Bruce and his ignorance to the restaurants ""unlimited soda refill policy"". Tommy apologized for the poor service that Bruce had given me. I told Tommy; ""I understand that it was busy during lunch but this was the worst service I\'ve had at your restaurant"". Tommy immediately replied; ""We weren\'t busy at all during lunch today and I apologize again"". With Tommy stating that it wasn\'t busy during lunch  it solidified my decision to give this establishment 1star. The taste of the food would\'ve bumped the rating to 2 stars but with the poor service any food would leave a foul taste in your mouth.So a message to you Bruce: FUCK YOU!!! God gave you 2 perfectly working legs  so use them properly to do your job you lazy bastard!"
Tina N.,Pomona  CA,4,8,,3/23/2014,5.0,My friend and I came for an early lunch on 3/23/14 at 11:00. We were seated right away and greeted promptly by our waitress Bernadette. She took our drink order as we were trying to decide on an appetizer. We ordered The Avocado Egg Roll with no cilantro. A runner brought out the appetizer and Bernadette noticed right away that there was cilantro on it. She told the runner to bring another order with no cilantro. We were impressed by her attentiveness. The Avocado Egg Roll was the most delicious appetizer we ever had. It had avocado  cream cheese  pine nuts and a hint of pepper; we suggest everyone to try it. Bernadette kept a good supply of Dr. Pepper coming to the table which is impressive since my friend loves this drink so much. My friend and I decided on the Great White Pizza. Bernadette brought out the plates and noticed right away that one of the plates was dirty. She apologized and brought out another plate. We were impressed by her observant manner. The pizza was delicious and creamy. Overall  our experience was excellent! Bernadette was cheerful  attentive  observant  and cared about us the customer. We will definitely come back to BJ's in Rowland Heights and hope to have Bernadette as our waitress!
susan l.,Rowland Heights  CA,263,735,1495,10/12/2010,3.0,goodbye black angus  hello BJsnote: due to their opening  beer is $3/glass!what i ate:- caprese salad (on their small bites menu): tomatoes werent the best  but the perlini and the balsamic vinegar were great. there were also red onions in the salad. what i didnt like was the extra sprinkling of parm cheese on top. seems rather redundant when the vinegar and dressing were salty enough. - veggie mini pizza: yummy- california club flat bread pizza: bacon  yum  avocado  yum. cheese  yum. whats not to like? a good alternative when youre craving thin crust pizzaambiance: great they totally remodeled the space and it looks like every other BJsservice: still working out the kinks - sometimes i was a bit confused as to who our server was because so many were coming by our table constantly asking if we needed anything. but overall everyone was helpful and friendlynothing to complain about. your standard BJs
Will W.,Alhambra  CA,3,27,9,8/11/2015,4.0,Came here for a late night happy hour. The prices are decent. The service was kind of slow for being a Monday night. The place was not busy at all. Had to wait a long time to refill drinks or get a certain condiment. The food came out in a decent time. The food was good for the price. Their mini deep dish pizza was very good as well as the poozookie. Recommend both if you don't know what to get. The prices are about average. I would come back again.
Brian C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,225,149,3,3/21/2012,4.0,I came by for an early lunch on Sunday. As expected  there was not wait. I had the Jambalaya which was surprisingly good. It was loaded with scallops  shrimp  chicken and mushrooms. I have to say  it was one of the best Jambalaya's that I have ever eaten  Although  it was not spicy enough for my taste  I highly recommend it. I've tried the pizzas before  not at this location  but it's a little pricey for what you actually get.I'll definitely be back for the Jambalaya and to try their happy hour drink menu.
Rosa M.,Pomona  CA,104,90,62,11/13/2011,2.0,Blowjobs......lmaoAnyway  the restaurant itself is nice and spacey. The seating is spacious! I hate bumping into our neighbors.I had the Piranha Pale Ale chili cheese burger with the thin cut fries and the orange twist drink. The burger was bleh. Tasteless but hefty. I'm in a food coma as I type. The fries were good. I blasted everything with ketchup because it was SO frickin' bland! Orange Twist drink was delicious! My diabetes popped wood. $10.95 for burger $2.95 for my orangey goodness.My spawn had a grilled sandwich. He like it enough to want another one.Server was nice but dude was soooooooo busy. It took a LONG while to get our food and even longer to get my spawn's pizookie. Getting a straw for my drink was a mission. I probably wouldn't come back. I'd just go to the Chili's across the street.
Summer F.,Pomona  CA,13,1,,1/16/2015,1.0,"We had a party of 24 & we booked a reservation a week in advance to avoid a long wait time. When we arrived  they told us they were booked & we wouldn\'t be seated. We waited an hour & a half then asked the hostess what the progress was. She rolled her eyes & told us ""No. You didn\'t have a reservation."" We spoke to the manager who wasn\'t helpful AT ALL & didn\'t offer us anything for the inconvenience. Two and a half hours later we were seated. I can\'t believe we stayed to eat after the awful unhelpful service  but we knew a party our size wouldn\'t be able to find another place to eat together. What a nightmare. I never want to go to this BJs again because of the workers!! Customer service is the most important thing about a restaurant. So disappointed"
Tammy L.,Glendora  CA,212,105,32,6/21/2014,3.0,I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes the service is nice  sometimes its not. Food is mediocre  but I do like there pizza. Best time to come here is for happy hour but it's usually crowded. I like the fact that they brew there own beers which is a nice change from just bottled beers. There pizzokie is also good  but make sure to share!
Linda R.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,27,,9/30/2015,4.0,It's always very inviting. The food is better than most restaurants within the 5 miles radius. Recommend their appetizers. They are tasty and well priced. Their cocktails are very good (recommend apple martini and monitor). The service is always superb. Truly recommend.
Bianca H.,La Puente  CA,19,39,7,6/18/2014,5.0,I always enjoy eating at bjs. But tonight I experienced great service and a supremely tasty meal. Jeff was a really nice server. He took care of us and comped us the desert when the one we wanted wasn't available. We had the calamari which is always tasty here. Our chicken pasta was sooo yummy. I just wish it had more broccoli. Lastly our mixed berry cobbler  which was supposed to be the peach one  but the kitchen ran out  was sooo good. I acted like the little girl from the commercial who did not want to share. Oh and my tea was refreshing. Mocktails!!
Bill S.,West Covina  CA,0,5,,4/17/2012,1.0,had lunch with my wife here today...MISTAKE!it took at least 40 mins to serve our order...simple tacos and quesadillas! Their lunch specials...it looks big on the pic  but they came out very tiny (bite size)...another mistake! it took us 10 mins to eat it all. the waitress was nice and considerate but she couldn't do anything to speed it up. the place became full 'cause everyone was waiting for their orders!...no one couldn't leave. naturally  the place got really loud and noisy...been to other BJ's  i think this is how it is...just loud!if you're hoping for a quick lunch and get back to work  this is NOT the place!there's always a first time...we learned our lesson...quick lunch or not  never again!
Rock R.,Garden Grove  CA,0,19,5,9/16/2015,1.0,Great food and reasonable prices. The staff on the otherhand in the Puente Hills restaurant made our first visit our last visit. The hostess sat us down in our booth and murmured something as she walked away. Promptly Geoff the server asked if we would like some appetizers. We said it's our 1st time. We don't know what you have. Oh I'll give you a few minutes  and he walked away without suggesting anything. 10 minutes later he returns again  lacking any kind life  and takes our order. After a reasonable amount of time we receive our entrees. The meal was excellent. Geoff stop by frequently with a stoic expression asking if everything was alright. We paid  left a 14% tip and walked out. When we got home we see a commercial on TV talking about their two for $25 special which nobody at the restaurant told us about or advertised. Perhaps the other restaurants may have better staffing  I don't know  but one day in the distant  distant future I'll find out.
Jenna C.,West Covina  CA,162,21,,1/25/2014,2.0,I give this location two stars for their service. The host are rude and are too busy talking or on their phones. It's like really? Do the job your being paid to do. The servers are forgetful  except Desiree she was on point. My food was cold. I couldn't get my first servers attention (not Desiree) to address the problem. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location.
Kim R.,Beverly Hills  CA,43,54,,4/22/2013,4.0,We came here on Saturday evening just to try their Baby Beck Ribs ... they were good.They come with choice of salad or soup for the side order so we chose Clam Chowder Soup  man ... The best Clam Chowder Soup I've ever eaten!Service wasn't that bad (place was really busy that night) but finding a parking space kinda sux though.
J. B.,Chino Hills  CA,19,42,29,6/24/2012,4.0,"I must say that I haven\'t been the biggest BJ\'s fan in the past....guess I always thought of them as a ""pizza"" place which I\'m not so fond of.Anyways  I have come here a few times for lunch and I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by their lunch menu and what they are offering.The have some great lunch specials as well as some low-calorie options. I\'m a huge fan of the chili. I usually order a half chili / half sandwich combo.The next step will be coming here for dinner to try out some different items on the menu.Great for lunch  quick and efficient service  comfy clean environment. Keep putting out quality food and we will keep coming back.Don\'t Put the Fork Down !!!"
Teri C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,8,,9/5/2015,1.0,Very disappointed. Called ahead to make sure the game we wanted to watch was on. Get there  won't turn on our game for a good 40 minutes as someone else is watching a (61to 20 score) game. Never mind that most of the people in the bar wanted the same game we came for. We won't be back to this location.
Jeff L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,10,35,249,3/13/2014,3.0,Came here for lunch with a group of co-workers. Menu has a pretty good selection  so there should be something for everyone. Good place to get a drink as they have many varieties of beer  but I am no drinker. Food was alright  nothing special. I ordered the California burger cooked medium with a side of wedge-cut seasoned fries. Burger arrived more of a medium-well and the fries were on the well-done side. The burger itself wasn't bad with the included toppings. Service was above average as the waitress came around twice to fill our drinks and brought out lemon wedges for our water when asked. Several TVs on the wall showing sports  so should be a good choice for March Madness. Overall  place is A-OK for a casual meal  especially during lunch time.
Jenny K.,Los Angeles  CA,947,1245,238,10/24/2011,3.0,"first time we have visited this BJ\'s location. it\'s smaller than most BJ\'s. the deals are good but happy hour stated on the menu was confusing.it says ""Monday through Friday 3 - 7pm AND Sunday through Thursday 10pm - close.""we arrive on sunday at 5pm. she tells us that it\'s happy hour. so i\'m reading the deals and menus again.. when i ask her about it  she says  ""yes  it is what is written there...EXCEPT that if there is a game on  then it\'s happy hour during the game."" basically just no happy hour on saturday. she told us that the type of game is not specified but football is definitely happy hour. it\'s whatever her cashier rings up -- she didn\'t even know which games made it happy hour. it\'s weird because there is always SOME GAME on...but don\'t know if it\'s happy hour worthy.other specials:Monday -- All day $5 martinis and mojitosTuesday -- All day half off winesordered: mini pizza -- sweet pig (aka hawaiian pizza)gourmet mac n\' cheese (from small bites)fresh mozzarella/tomato salad flatbread pizza -- margheritafood is inconsistent. we didn\'t know if it was a new BJs thing or if it was the location. after readings the reviews  i think it\'s the latter. our mini pizza was uneven from the height to the toppings. one piece did not have cheese...another piece didn\'t have tomato. tasted about the same but a bit smaller.fresh mozarrella/tomato salad was tasty but we felt like we were tricked since it looked like half a salad. the other half just had a zigzag balsamic vinegar on the plate. flavoring was enjoyable...balls of mozarella  chunks of tomato  chopped basil and red onions.gourmet mac n\' cheese was not bad. rotelle pasta in a cheesy mixture topped with slight bread crumbs and some bacon. (i prefer elephant bar\'s mac n\' cheese...sooo delicious!!! you have to try it if you\'ve never had it).flatbread margherita was okay but too wet.. too much cheese that weighed down the flatbread. (red lobster has a perfect lobster thin crusted pizza)service was fine. they just really need to up the standard in terms of quality control for the food. up until this time  i didn\'t know that BJ\'s could deviate from the BJ\'s i have always known and loved. (cerritos BJ\'s is much much better!!).i\'ll probably be back for happy hour. hopefully the food will turn out better next time. 3.5 stars...rounded down for the inconsistency of the food... someone needs to talk to the chef."
Howard L.,Chino Hills  CA,0,14,,8/31/2015,2.0,Their waitress steal my credit card info and use it somewhere else.
Don S.,Hacienda Heights  CA,189,84,21,9/14/2011,2.0,Our feelings about our local BJ's Restaurant:FOOD (Grade: B  Very Good). My wife and I have been eating here for over a year now and we both enjoy their good foods.A few of our favorites:-------------------------------------------:BBQ Chicken Pizza - One of our family favorites.Cobb Salad - Chopped and ready to eat (they are cheap on salad dressing  so be sure to ask for more  its free).Clam Chowder - my wife loves it and so do I. They have an excellent recipe and it has LOTS of chopped clams (many restaurants put very little clam in their chowder. SERVICE IN RESTAURANT (Grade: C+  Average). Unfortunately  this is their main problem - one day its ok  and another day its bad. They are always polite  however  getting service at your table can be a problem. A number of our friends feel the same on this - BJ'S  GET YOUR SERVICE IMPROVED!!!!!!SERVICE FOR FOOD TO GO - TAKE OUT (Grade: D  Poor). Our server  Stephanie F. took our order for a pizza  salad and soup. I asked for extra dressing and she said she would get in trouble with her manager - so I told her I would give her $1.00 for 2 extra of their very small containers for salad dressing - and she got it for me! We were pretty upset we had to pay a tip for extra dressing (By the way  if you eat there  they give you extra dressing for free! Figure that out!!)PARKING (Grade: A  Loads of free parking).BOTTOM LINE: WE WILL RETURN  OCCASIONALLY (MORE OFTEN IF THEY COULD IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE).
Cody W.,Claremont  CA,9,6,1,9/18/2015,1.0,The rudest bearded white cocktail server... He wouldn't acknowledged me or respond... I never leave reviews but this guy earned it
Ash P.,Chino Hills  CA,69,24,1,3/15/2012,4.0,BJ's!When you go to a BJ's you know what to expect. A relaxed atmosphere where you can have a good time with your friends or family. The location is not bad  kind of secluded. Parking can be a problem sometimes. Customer service is improving.Love the Chicken Wings!
Diana E.,La Verne  CA,86,85,51,3/28/2014,4.0,Customer service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. Their wings where awesome the burger was average.
Jennifer F.,Los Angeles  CA,437,246,279,7/22/2011,3.0,It's always crowded during dinnertime  but service is always great. The atmosphere is perfect for reunions and social gatherings. We started off with the Best Beginners appetizer combo which includes spinach & artichoke dip  sante fe spring rolls  mozzarella sticks  and avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls were fantastic! We each ordered an entree. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was too salty (and hugely portioned)  and the spaghetti with marinara sauce was bland and boring. The scampi pasta and Mediterranean pizza however  were quite tasty. For dessert  we shared the Triple Chocolate Pizookie--pizza cookie! This was delightful: a giant chocolate cookie topped with chocolate ice cream and chocolate--all Ghirardelli!
Maria M.,Whittier  CA,1,98,135,4/30/2014,3.0,I really like the Thai Chicken Mango Salad. It's light and refreshing. The wait is usually not too bad but today's wait was pretty long  for our food (45 minutes). Service was good. We complained to the manager on duty and he barely uttered an apology only saying he has no idea why it took so long. Wasn't impressed with his customer service skills. Probably won't go back as there's no way to go there and back to work in an hour.
Dopin W.,Chinatown  Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,2/2/2014,1.0,The attitude of restaurant is very bad  we came to restaurant earlier but waitress let us wait over 40 mins   and she let other customers who came in restaurant later than us go into restaurant first. It's not the first time  my friends said they are racist to different customers  especially for Asian.
Coach I.,City of Industry  CA,0,44,25,4/24/2014,5.0,this place is always a great place for family and couples nite out !!not a singles place.. but maybe you'll get lucky !! hahaa..superb food and beer.. long waits though.TVs are sweeeeeeeet !!!
Katy Y.,San Gabriel  CA,15,660,512,6/13/2012,4.0,Four stars for the food but 2.5 stars for the service. Although the waitress was kind  she was very SLOW. We came in here at almost 2pm for a late lunch and it wasn't that busy on a Tuesday. The waitress wasn't the brighest. My daUghter spilled water and I had to ask her for paper. She took awhile to come back rather than rush it.My husband ordered a large pizza with everything on it. IT was quite delicious. I ordered a small house salad w/ranch dressing and grilled chicken baked potatoe. Maybe bc I was hungry  but the baked chicken was one of the best I've ever had!!!My toddler was also a huge fan and she's such a picky eater.The layout of the restaurant is also better than monrovia's Bj's bc it's more open space.
Stapawa W.,Seal Beach  CA,1,8,,7/16/2015,1.0,Bj's -- Food and Drinks are always good  HOWEVER the Manager at 5.30pm Wednesday 7/15 has no problem having guest be inconvenience by NOT allowing the umbrellas to be moved to block sun light. Her reasoning --- that it was to close to the out door heater and they are not allowed to be moved  the umbrellas. None of heaters were on as the temperature at that time was well into the 80's and unlikely to be turned on at all  its summer time!!! .  Shame on you.
Wilson T.,San Francisco  CA,303,444,32,5/7/2012,3.0,The pizza is really good. The service is good but slow. the sliders were just alright.It's just that this place is too expensive. Pizza plus sliders was 50 bucks. Too much.
Richard P.,Hacienda Heights  CA,101,18,13,12/26/2013,5.0,Had a great reasonable priced lunch. The waiters and managers are cool peeps. The Asian manager with the red shirt is always attentive and ready to help. Will be back soon.
Gary H.,Knoxville  TN,8,5,,5/20/2014,5.0,one word.... PIZOOKIE! Get the triple chocolate and then don't be surprised by your sugar high.
Gaby G.,Rowland Heights  CA,0,1,,7/11/2015,1.0,"Really bad service  slow even at restaurant half capacity. we didnt get silverware so how they expect we eat our food  I asked ""no onions"" on my food and thats the first thing I got. Took more than 20 min to get a beer and a box. Don\'t go there bad service bad food."
Leti M.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,14,,12/22/2012,3.0,I like the food BUT I did not like their customer service.Went to sit at the bar to have some dinner since it would take over half an hour to get seated and the bartender was being very rude. My friend asked for a beer and waited half an hour and never got it so we asked one of the girl bartenders for it and she served it within five minutes.
Susan L.,Rowland Heights  CA,306,164,242,4/6/2012,4.0,Bjs is the spot to go if you want to hang out and have some good food and drinks. I just hate how long the wait can be on busy nights. I always my usual here which is there Cajun Shrimp pasta and a glass of my favorite wine. They have options like lower calorie dishes or small bites for those that aren't too hungry. I have tried there Southwestern salad  Tilapia and Chicken dish (its the lower calorie entrees)  all there pastas  meatloaf  pot roast dish  love there appetizer: avocado egg rolls  thai shrimp lettuce wraps  spinach and artichoke dip and many others. The food here is really good and I haven't had any complaints about it  just that it take a while for it to come out. I especially love there pizookie! It is a must have here! A warm cookie any flavor you want (I love white chocolate macadamia nut) with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.. DELISH!This is the place to go when I want to eat good food and hangout with friends.
Teagan T.,Los Angeles  CA,258,514,874,4/21/2011,1.0,----  This review is for their food only **  ---------------Long story short You come here for the ambience and beer.Their food... or maybe it just depends on the chefs at different locations.But this place  food was not fresh  lack of flavor.Just .. very disappointed.I've tried other BJ's and they weren't that bad. Service was attentive.Not coming back to be a regular.
Sophie D.,Hacienda Heights  CA,54,98,55,10/6/2013,4.0,This is a great place for planning large parties. (homecoming  birthday dinners  etc...) The food was great! Maybe it was due to the fact that by the time our food came out (which did take a while because we had so many people) I was starving. I shared the medium BBQ chicken pizza with my friend. It was a pleasant amalgamation of sweet and savory  the perfect blend of BBQ and ooey cheese. The crust is crispy and the pizza is not at all dense nor greasy. It was great! Just make sure you eat it quickly or else it does get a bit soggy towards the end. I'd come back to try more of their pizzas  pastas  or pizookies. I woudln't suggest coming too often. My other friend ordered a pasta and the portion size was nothing short of gargantuan. Definitely not a great place to come if you are trying to watch your waistline.But you know...there's always room to indulge.
Jay C.,Ontario  CA,55,68,9,5/13/2011,3.0,"Went with a large group. I guess the waiter already knew that he\'s gonna get his guaranteed tip so he came by our table for about 4 times the entire night. Yup... 3 times... first time to take order  second time to bring the drinks  third time to bring food  and fourth time to bring over more water and drinks... and then we got our check.It was almost impossible to ask our waiter to come over. I think he spends more time with the couple sitting at the table next to us. For a large group of 15  I\'d definitely think he should come by more often and ask us if there\'s anything else we need and take care of us.Enough said about the bad service... or should I say ""no service""? Avocado Egg Rolls  BBQ Chicken Chop Salad  and pizzas taste really good. I\'ve been here a few times and no all menu items taste great but the ones I got tonight definitely made up for the service."
Melanie T.,Los Angeles  CA,181,48,55,1/30/2011,4.0,Me and my boyfriend like to come here for their lunch special. I usually order the giant baked potato and he orders a sandwich. Overall the food is great  I knocked off a star because somehow they put cheese and bacon on my SALAD instead of my potato. Weird  right? Oh and I also like their scampi pasta :D! The service is great and a couple of my friends from high school work here too so it's nice seeing them.
Robert M.,Chino  CA,65,283,2,1/12/2012,4.0,BJ's is a BJ's is a BJ's  right?Well  sort of. But I do really like the design of the bar here. It doesn't seem to be a crowded BJ's; Sunday playoff games last weekend did not bring many sports fans  at least.They have a nice array of guest taps; not always the case at BJ's. Since  they centralized brewing and one can't get much in the way of variety or experimentation other than a regular seasonal any longer  it's nice to have a choice of Green Flash or Lost Abbey and some other good ones. The service on the few occasions that I've visited has been cordial and effective.I also appreciate its proximity to Costco  making the up-to-2-hour wait for a tire rotation less painful.
Jennifer C.,Chino  CA,660,945,866,5/21/2011,4.0,The beer here is excellent n not too pricey...known for their deep dish pizzas which do not disappoint and of course the potato skins r always delish...great place to unwind after work or watch the game
Alexandra W.,Brea  CA,24,8,2,10/22/2013,5.0,Always come here for sports events or even for dinner or a quick drink. We always sit at the bar. The bartenders are so great! Always recognize me and my boyfriend and always try to make conversation with all the customers they have. Love it.
Tiffany N.,West Covina  CA,335,544,162,11/8/2011,4.0,This place is pretty new so its super clean & stylish inside. The parking kinda sucks though ( depends on which days you go) but the food is always good.
Blair M.,Oakland  CA,68,107,22,12/24/2010,2.0,BJ's and me are the same age and I've been coming here (well  not this location) since I was a little kid. Like any long term relationship we've had our ups and downs. But we've been through thick (crust) and thin. I used to take dates to the Balboa location when I was in high school.But I think it's time now we go our separate ways  irreconcilable differences and all that jazz. BJ's used to be a Chicago style pizza joint with a few locations. With a new century came new financial success for BJ's as it turned into a Chain Restaurant. And thus the seeds of this not too amicable divorce were sown.The pizza has been going downhill as part of the chain-ifacation process which eliminate uniqueness and character and commodifies and uniforms the food. Each location used to be different. Now when I am in Tucson I can walk into a BJ's  blindfolded and know where everything is. This location is on a restaurant row with a Red Lobster. Nuff said? About the chain aspect perhaps.But I' not here to bash chain restaurants. Much.This visit:Service - 1 starAnnoyance 1: The hostess made us wait while 'our table was being cleaned.' When we were finally seated it was next to a clean table that I had been eyeballing from the moment we walked in  in the same section with the same waiter.Annoyance 2: The waiter  Ivan  was awful. Dirty dishes remained on our table  taking up space  despite us asking 3 times for him to remove them. Drinks were never refilled. There was a problem with our order that we were not informed of until the food was brought out. In short  we were ignored.Annoyance 3: We ordered a large pizza  half Mediterranean  half Sweet Pig. They ran out of large dough (?! - again  a problem that would only occur at a chain restaurant) and instead brought us a small and a medium. While I appreciate the solution  we didn't appreciate that the waiter took it upon himself to make this decision. Ask us  the customers  what we want when there is a problem. The problem with what he decided was that they did half and half on both the small and the medium resulting in neither being neatly done and everything getting all mixed up.The food - 1 starContinuing with the above  the pizza toppings were sloppy resulting in 2/3 of the slices being kinda gross really. The other slices managed to only have their intended toppings. And it seems that the chefs forgot how to cut pizza slices - the sizes ranged from 1/3 the pan  to ritz cracker sized. I would have complained  but my waiter was never around and my table was too hungry.For appetizers we got the Fried artichoke hearts and the stuffed mushrooms. The former were great and the latter were ok. I might have regarded the mushrooms better  but they're just mushroom caps stuffed with their spinach-artichoke dip.
Chandler M.,Houston  TX,91,283,10,12/17/2011,4.0,This BJ's is one of around 25 casual-dining places in the Puente Hills Industrial-commercial complex  along with every American chain restaurant known to man. In other words the competition to stay delicious is a big deal when I have so many alternatives. I don't honestly know how the economics of this area works. ANYWAYIt's a BJ's. Fantastic deep-dish pizza; My friends and I went for the cheeseburger pizza and it was marvelous. The house-made cream soda was very odd-tasting but the fresh Root beer was fantastic. Our waiter allowed us to swap out when we told him the creme soda wasn't expected. Very nice gentleman who checked on us often - I think i gave him a 40% tip for what he helped us with!All in all there was nothing really to complain about. the decor was standard BJ's with a lot of sports on TV and a whole lot of people talking and eating. It smelled good. My stigma against BJ's has all but disappeared after so many good experiences with them. We also ordered the Pizookie sampler with ice cream and that was very enjoyable. I'm not really a Happy Hour Guy (my work schedule started at 6pm so I never got them anyway) but this seems to ahve a good happy hour. I'd come here again if I was in a pizza mood and around Puente Hills (which means I'm at Round One most likely).
Aldo R.,El Monte  CA,121,41,7,12/8/2011,4.0,Great place! I love the beer selection  and the cocktails are pretty good too. The pizza is delicious and the pizzookie  well u just can't got to BJ's without trying it.And the Best beginnings appetizer is just great!
Steven C.,El Paso  TX,73,363,114,9/30/2011,2.0,i sort of wanna give a 3 star review  but that wouldnt be true to the food. the spinach and artichoke dip is awesome  but very junk food esque. the stuffed mushrooms? mushroom caps w/ some pesto filling  also had a cheap taste to it. i love mushrooms so this was a bit offensive. italian market salad was good. it was so funny my friend thought the artichoke hearts was chicken. i really wish asian restaurants would have nicer salads like this. the vegetarian pizza was interesting. topping was just whatever but i was feeling the whole wheat crust. im sure their dishes w/ meat are probly much better.. but this was just my experience. i had some sorta creamy coffee alcohol drink that was just one of the worst recommendations i've ever gotten from a server. i mean.. look at the food im eating.. other than that she was nice tho.
Je N.,Fullerton  CA,98,7,15,3/26/2013,1.0,The service is terrible here asked the water when i sat down 10 minutes passed where is my water? I have to go to speak with the front desk to get the attention of the staffs so I can get myself a cup of water. Then the manager came apologize and picked up the tab. I certainly will not come again. I feel i am being discriminated in this place.
Alondra R.,La Puente  CA,0,3,1,2/28/2014,5.0,"So I came to BJs craving a well done steak  I asked the waiter what was the difference between a Rib Eye steak and Top Sirloin steak. He said the Rib Eye was a more fattier cut and the Top Sirloin was a more lean cut. I wanted my steak thick so assuming that the waiter meant thick when he said ""fattier"" I went with the Rib Eye. After I received my delicious-looking plate  I began to dig in! I noticed that my steak started tasting a little gooey  then I looked at the inside of it and there was FAT mixed in my steak! Maybe I misunderstood the waiter when he mentioned the fattier portion of the steak  so I admit it was a fault on my part. I mentioned to my waiter that I wasn\'t satisfied with my steak and followed that by asking if I could get a Top Sirloin steak instead. I also mentioned my confusion about the two  but he apologized about that and said I would be able to receive my steak the way I desired free of charge. He acted in a very polite manner  and to top it off my Top Sirloin steak was amazingly delicious. Thank you for the wonderful customer service Michael G! :)"
Rena H.,Los Angeles  CA,5,55,1,6/12/2011,2.0,"While I\'m normally a fan of the food and beer at BJ\'s  I\'m probably not quite a fan of this particular location of BJ\'s. Until I\'m convinced that their service isn\'t going to be wiggidy whack  or unless I\'ve got my pre-party on beforehand to the point of which service doesn\'t matter  I\'m not sure if I\'m going to frequent this location.I came here for a friend\'s birthday with my boyfriend and my friend\'s brother who had just moved here. We were seated without much of a wait  and we got our glasses of water right away. A few minutes later  our server plops down a plate of avocado egg rolls that we didn\'t order. So I notify him that we had not ordered those  to which he responded  ""Oh  but didn\'t you order these? I had asked you if you wanted avocado egg rolls and you said \'yes.\'"" Now I\'m thinking  okay  this guy is just making stuff up. So I tell him that no  I di\'in\'t  and he promptly took them away.We ordered our food and everything was beautiful and tasty. We also notified the server that it was our friend\'s birthday. Now  we had ordered an additional pizookie because our friend had a cold and was worried that we\'d catch whatever he had. So that pizookie was brought out  but his birthday pizookie hadn\'t. I\'m not complaining about not receiving a free pizookie  but THEN our same weird server remembered at a random time and he told us he was bringing TWO. That would be a total of 3 pizookies. Uh what the heck.My friend quickly said  ""NO! I DON\'T WANT TWOOOO--"" but the server was gone  and while he was  my friend joked  ""Oh my god  if he brings two  no tip for him. That\'s just overdoing it."" HA... We did leave some tip though  being the good citizens we were.Maybe I shouldn\'t hate on this BJ\'s  but the service was just TOO weird. Too bad I don\'t remember the guy\'s name... but if I do come here again  I don\'t want him as our server."
Stefan M.,Walnut  CA,25,7,2,3/21/2015,5.0,We had good service on a sat night. We were offered a complimentary slice of pizza whole waiting for our table. Food was good. I had a bison burger. It was cooked rare. That might turn off some people being rate  but not me. Overall good time.
Hope C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,117,36,,11/22/2012,1.0,"What a terrible  racist establishment! Awful awful service!!My coworkers and I used to come here for happy hour from time to time  until about a month ago when the manager told us we were cut off after TWO pitchers of beer between EIGHT people in the timespan of over two hours. For being too loud. NEWSFLASH: it\'s the bar area  people are talking  people are watching sports  it\'s gonna be loud  PERIOD. We\'re a large party talking in a noisy-ass room  we have to raise our voices just to be heard by the person sitting across from us.So chalk it up to one bad manager with a stick up his ass. Returned last night to the BITCHIEST waitress I\'ve ever had the displeasure of encountering. I arrived after the other four members of our party. We asked for another plate because the table had been set for four  silverware because there was NONE  some napkins because we hadn\'t been provided silverware so no cloth napkins (such simple logic)  and a glass of water. This waitress had the audacity to roll her eyes at us and say with not a small amount of attitude  ""Is there ANYTHING ELSE I can get for you?"" I\'m sorry we\'re a party of chatty Asians asking you for things you should have already provided us (or at the very least not have been surprised to be asked for)  blondie. No need to get all uppity. I wouldn\'t be surprised if she spat into the water  that\'s how venomous her attitude was. Doing things like sighing so hard I could see her doing it whenever she approached our table.The worst service I\'ve ever experienced from any BJs. In fact  one of the best servers I\'ve ever had there  consistently  was a waitress who looked really high. I don\'t want to say she definitely was  because hey  maybe homegirl has red eyes from allergies (on at least 2-3 separate occasions...)  but if she WAS  maybe the other wait staff should follow her example so they can CHILL THE F OUT.Also the food is super greasy and the pizza toppings aren\'t fresh. If I want a brew after work  I\'m going to take my business to one of the thousand and one other places in the area that serve alcohol and NOT get the third degree.NEVER AGAIN. Not even if you paid me."
Vince M.,Chino  CA,50,21,1,12/19/2013,1.0,This review is based on the treatment received while on the bar area. We were spoken to like children. We got the instructions the first time around and that should be enough!
Sarah C.,Burbank  CA,893,1083,59,10/10/2010,4.0,Newly Opened BJsBrew  Pizza  Pizookie and more. Menu same as other locations  large restaurant with plenty of plasma screen tvs  bar  indoor and outdoor patio seating  plenty of parking. Not really my cup of tea but the service and place is great.
Adam N.,Seal Beach  CA,331,202,94,2/1/2013,4.0,Great tomato and mozzarella plate. Barbacoa tacos ain't half bad either!!
Erniie M.,La Puente  CA,3,2,1,3/2/2014,1.0,Great service  great waitress! She's soo cute & polite & attented us at all time. But I shall give it a one star cause they removed the red velvet pozookie!
Ann C.,Chino Hills  CA,714,542,470,12/3/2010,3.0,KITCHEN KINKSI love BJ's (that's what she said) but this location has to work out the kinks in the kitchen. I've been here 3 times since they opened and twice there were issues with the food.Once  the tomato mozzarella salad came out with the cheese still frozen solid! I don't know how the chefs in the back couldn't have seen the ice all over the cheese balls. I had food poisoning for 4 days after that. Yesterday  I went with a group of 6 and the food took forevers to come out. When it did  the pizza was luke warm and dried out. BBQ chicken should be saucy and fresh but it was just gross. Our waitress did have it remade but again  how could the chefs let that kind of food out?I hope that this is just the disarray of a new restaurant opening and they work it out. Order their avocado egg rolls- BOMB DIGGITY!
Nicole K.,Huntington Beach  CA,70,21,,5/19/2012,4.0,Met my boyfriend here after work last night--it's great because it's RIGHT NEXT TO Speedzone (great gokart place--he was able to drive on over after his speedzone day to meet me).Got a steak--usually go with sharing a pizza  and it was really good. His pasta dish took about 45 minutes and the manager came out to offer us dessert as compensation. Had a double chocolate pizookie.Overall  great food  great atmosphere... I recommend this location because of their awesome tv screens--great to watch a Lakers game on. :-)
Megan A.,Fullerton  CA,4,6,,4/22/2013,4.0,BJ's was a fun restaurant to go to. I loved their bacon cheeseburgers (which were the size of my head). The staff is very welcoming as well. My friend ordered a pizza and they brought it out completely wrong! They gave us a refund for the pizza and made it again which was very nice. I just hope the cook didn't spit in her food! I suggest coming to this restaurant if you are ready to get stuffed. (:
Jennifer C.,Buena Park  CA,76,267,229,9/2/2013,4.0,Our server was great. We had a great time. Took us for ever to determine what we wanted to eat. The server was helpful and patient.
Grace C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,500,117,30,12/10/2010,5.0,This BJ's has some really good food. For some reason  the BJ's here was exceptionally better than the BJ's in the Los Angeles area. This place just opened recently and the decor is really nice. Service was excellent!Try the broccoli cheddar soup if you're a big fan of cheesy  creamy soup.The original french roast dip with horseraddish HITS THE SPOT  and the boyfriend really enjoyed his california burger -- more like a sandwich  it was had angus beef with avacado  pepper jack cheese and more  on top of garlic toast.Lots of TVs to watch  and a full bar.
Tiger L.,Diamond Bar  CA,340,71,11,2/2/2013,4.0,Who doesn't like BJ's? Good selection of food. Good atmosphere. No complaints.
Nina R.,Whittier  CA,9,49,,12/12/2010,5.0,This is my first time at a BJs restaurant believe it or not. We ordered: 1. Mediterranean Pizza 2. Crispy Chicken Sandwich with thin cut fries 3. Spinach and Artichoke dip 4. Southwest rolls?Very filling and there was plenty left over. I felt like I was going to explode.The service was very good  the waiter was attentive and nice.
Andrea H.,CA  CA,53,169,353,3/2/2011,4.0,A typical brewery place to come out  enjoy a drink or two with some friends as I watch Lakers game. Basically  I was in the bar area not sure how the regular services are if seated in the sitting area. I love their appertizers... so I order potstickers  stuffed mushroom  and tuna but I really enjoy their pazookie!!!  Yummie *0*The bartenders (Chris) was very friendly and made sure we were okay with our drinks. I've been to other BJ's (Brea) and never had any problem with their services.
Andrea C.,San Dimas  CA,3,8,8,10/31/2013,5.0,Turns out on Thurs nights they have happy hour til 9 (maybe for football season) so our beers were $3.50. They also have a great $19.95 special which includes  soup or salad  a medium pizza and a pizooki! When my husband and I go to BJ's we always have the Great White pizza  so this was right up our alley. Sometimes the pizza is dry  so we ask for extra alfredo sauce but tonight the pizza was on point! You can imagine then how disappointed I was when on the way home I realized I had left it behind. I went back and they had already thrown it away. Dang. But the manager was kind enough to make us a new pizza. Gotta give them 5 stars for that. Thanks!
Caleb F.,Tysons Corner  Mclean  VA,36,193,2,9/19/2011,5.0,One of the few places I will drink a beer from... for the folks that are not much into drinking.GOOD:I like the atmosphere here. I went on a monday night  so there is no wait. The food was delicious and heavy  just the way I like it. The customer service  different that waiter service was superb. See the experience below.BAD:Though service was friendly  the waiter seemed interested in getting us to buy more  used typical tactics of start you off with a drink or appetizer  or can I interest you in a pazookie. He came around once or twice.EXPERIENCE:So we ordered a medium BJs favorite pizza. When the order came out  the server stated that the cheese was not evenly distributed  so they offered us a free pizza complimentary. So we wound up taking the new one home since there was extra food... much extra. To be honest  we didn't notice and they could have easily let it go  but they did the right thing by going above and beyond to ensure that the pizza we order was made satisfactorily  even though we didn't have any complaints.
Michelle M.,Alhambra  CA,34,59,219,7/7/2011,5.0,Plates serve big portions. Very good food and drinks. Try the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. Topped with bread crumbs and parmasacheese.
James S.,Whittier  CA,8,17,,3/7/2013,4.0,So bomb  especially the pizza  I am a fan on bjs  but the very first time we went  we made reservations over the phone  when we got there  our table was given to someone else because they said they dont hold tables for reservations  so what is the point of calling? but the waiters are excellent  kind  and quick. The food is amazing too! The second time we went  they held the table which was weird from the first experience  maybe they changed their rules. So on the final note  I recommend this place.
Dr. Groovy O.,Los Angeles  CA,318,201,26,10/26/2010,3.0,If you've been to any other BJ's  its the same thing. Newly opened. Bartender's and service is good. I've only tried there appetizers and they were pretty good. Happy hour from 10pm - 12am. Not sure on the days. A few of the bartenders are new to the game so they might not know to much about there beer selection but you have many to choose from. I've been here a few times already and its always a cool crowd. I have yet to come during a Laker game. Hopefully they play the sound unlike other places. Other then that you won't be disappointed. ; ^ D
Ray C.,Rowland Heights  CA,2,14,,2/28/2015,2.0,I don't think I ever been here and had decent service. They are the slowest  worst experice I have ever encountered at a restaurant. The food is pretty good but again it's the service that sucks. I can understand once or twice but as I said before it's the same service every time I go. I'd personally choose a different place but my friends like the beer so that's where we always end up flagging our server down again and again and again! Oh and again when we want to pay the bill and get out of there
Kay C.,San Francisco  CA,97,106,15,8/15/2012,3.0,BJ's is  at best  lackluster.I feel that most of their dishes lack flavor  and their prices are not attuned with the quality of the food. I haven't tasted a pizookie  but I hear it's BJ's saving grace.Let's just say  I'm a connoisseur when it comes to BJs  and this BJs is one I would not come to ;)
S Y.,La Puente  CA,149,18,12,8/22/2013,4.0,Came here with friends for bday. The waiter was nice  service from him was good  he would help us decide on food  or give us some suggestions. He was nice enough to take our pictures too. The food was good  as always. Pizookies was yummy.
Christopher J.,Rowland Heights  CA,175,591,420,4/22/2011,5.0,Came here with a buddy on a Thursday night and arrived just in time for happy hour at 10pm. We grabbed center seats at bar and immediately I was drawn to the large selection of draft beers available here (as opposed to other locations).Their happy hour is pretty standard with discounts off alcohol and appetizers.. What more do you need this late at night??Overall  I enjoyed this location because it is local  offers a good selection of draft beers  very clean  and the staff were nice.
Steven S.,Hacienda Heights  CA,179,343,73,5/12/2011,3.0,Great food  beers  and pizookie. Just what you'd expect from this chain.Service is good - nothing spectacular or to rave about - just good... like what you would expect - nothing more  nothing less.They could get more stars if there were more enthusiastic or charismatic servers  but this is far from all the fluff of DT/West LA where all the actors use their charm to score up tips.
Jonny B.,Long Beach  CA,7,25,2,9/10/2013,4.0,"I rarely dine at BJ\'s but when I do I always enjoy the experience. There\'s nothing spectacular about the place but the food is consistently 4 stars. This location is one of 4-5 that I\'ve visited and its my least favorite so far. I had a case of bad luck when it came to my servers. Yes servers with an ""S"". Over the course of 2 hours I had four  yes four different servers. It was really annoying bcuz I had to repeat everything several times to several different people. I was rushed the entire time. I was there on a Sunday evening so they might have been under staffed but the rushed feeling isn\'t a good one for me. I come to enjoy my food  have great conversations with friends and family & I\'m always very generou$. One Star for service C of I but I\'ll forgive you bcuz my food was delicious. I had the Italian Chicken Parmesan this time and the Spinach Artichoke dip for an appetizer. Both were perfectly high in calories and finger lickin\' good. No complaints there!! Actually I lied...I do have one small complaint. My friend ordered the fried wontons as a starter....what a joke. 3 little tiny fried things with almost nothing in them. Stay away from the wontons. The best locations that I\'ve had the pleasure of visiting are Cerritos & The Block of Orange."
Angela W.,Los Angeles  CA,110,180,27,5/4/2013,3.0,Here's to watch the game and man... if there's a seat in the bar take it! I was kinda sad that they changed their happy hour menu and they took away my spinach flatbread pizza
Kimi P.,Rowland Heights  CA,124,182,57,10/28/2010,3.0,Go to another BJs. Went there for lunch today with family. It's recently opened so the place is clean  bright and pristine. Food: Calamari appetizer. Get it. It's really good. For my meal I ordered lunch time Soup~Clam Chowder and 1/2 Classic Baked Potato. The Clam Chowder luckily has a _lot_ of clams and not overflowing with potatoes  so nice... but really _salty_ today! Really salty. The baked potato sides (butter  sour cream  and 4 chives?). They really didn't give many chives. I had to ask for more. One of my aunts ordered the Fields of Green salad and they forgot the candied pecans. Service: Terrible. I would give them a 2 for service. Our server wasn't there half the time and we received our food really slow. Also asked for water/drink refills 3 times. Finally got them from a busboy (and not our server). Birthday Pizookie: When did they start giving mini-pizookies instead of full sized ones? That was a little disappointment  also the fact that you can't select which cookie you want on the bottom. Hopefully it'll grow as service improves... but for now I'm going to Brea or Covina.
Joe T.,West Covina  CA,29,29,85,10/9/2013,2.0,"The food was good but disappointed with the service and the utensils. Spotty and unclean steak knife and forks plus the server was forgetful. I asked for an extra butter  he left and never came back until 10 minutes later and said ""Sorry about that"" I reported the spotty utensils and forgetful waiter to the manager but did not get any compensation unlike some restaurants like Olive Garden  our meal was waived since we waited longer than expected."
Joseph C.,San Diego  CA,391,201,101,2/22/2013,4.0,"Great food! I\'ve tried probably half their menu from avocado rolls  ahi tuna  to the entrees from chicken salads  jambalaya rice  pizzas to their ""my fave"" red velvet/oreo pizookie! Makes me want run over there right now as I type this out. I love hanging out here for happy hours. I usually come here whenever we meet up for happy hour with my co-workers. This place is always lively which makes it the perfect scenario to talk about life while we chow down on those happy hour pizzas!"
Al G.,Hacienda Heights  CA,19,6,,10/9/2011,4.0,The mimosa is great. I ordered the BJ's California Scramble. The potatoes were crispy and very tasty. The eggs were fluffy and perfect. The cheese and the applewood bacon were just right. Sourdough toast was also perfect. I was surprised that there weren't more people there  but we got our food quick and hot. My wife had the French toast. Buttery and flavorful  it was very good. The syrup was warm and sweet. Overall a good experience. Our server Ashley  was very attentive and nice.
Roberto C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,110,20,,10/10/2010,4.0,I got a Vegas vibe from the restroom. Service was good. One huge screen in the bar area. Parking  no bueno  had to park in front of Acapulco.*Acapulco is now closed so parking is no longer an issue.*Golden Corral is now an issue....haha.
Andrew A.,Newport Beach  CA,56,43,,10/15/2010,5.0,If I'm honest I never really liked black angus.. so when I saw BJ's sign come up from the broken wreckage of a forgot black asshole restaurant I immediately pumped my fist. When you look at the outside of this place at night and then you look at the competition to the left.. it makes it look like the Las Vegas MGM Grand overlooking a motel 6. The inside was rather similar to the Chino Hills Bj's.. but not that I'm complaning. The BJ's interiors always out class any other restaurant in their category. If I'm honest the only one that I feel that can compete would be Cheese cake factory. The wait was just dreadful looking. I walked in with the girlfriend and I asked to be seated for 2.. the wait was nearly an hour and a half.. But I persevered and by some blind luck we were seated in about five minutes. I don't know how or really care why but it made my day just that much better. The service was top notch.. the waiter expressed his passion for this beer that I'll never forget called the Heritage 100. Now good god if you like a Pale Ale then you must try this. It was the most crisp  clear tasting beer that I've had or have had in a very long time. The waiter continued checking on us through the night and I never felt the urge to have to flag someone down for something as I was always taken care of very well. The food is what you'd expect from BJ's. Exhilarating. Fantastic. Sexual. Orgasmic. The first bite into my Mediterranean pizza made my eyes roll 180 degrees. I think with the Heritage 100 beer is just was the ultimate combo. After that we had the famous Pizookie which just kinda seared in my mouth orgasm to final explosion. (Okay  I'll stop with the sexual euphemisms) Everything was done right here and I'll definitely be back soon..
JJ R.,Rowland Heights  CA,103,44,50,4/25/2011,2.0,"I\'ve come to this BJ\'s with family and friends many times and have sat in both dinning area and bar but have yet to receive acceptable service. The only reason to come here is for their beer or their pizookie (for the wifely).This place needs to get a better wait staff and management team. The last time I went with a group of friends we noticed the bartender pouring our beer (Stout) wrong. She was pouring our beer in a pitcher then pouring the beer in a glass. When we asked the manager about this practice he responded with ""Our dark beer runs on a O2 system and has to be poured in this manner""...for real? Is this guy dumb! I hope this place gets a new crew or trains their staff soon! The service gets negative stars  the food get two  but the beer gets four."
Charles T.,La Puente  CA,238,307,45,1/7/2011,2.0,I went in during lunch hours so i helped myself to one of their lunch portions. I went with the Cajun Pasta and it included a bowl of soup with my dish so i ordered clam chowder. I waited at least 20-30 minutes for my food to arrive. If it weren't for the many flatscreens mounted on the walls playing ESPN I would've fell asleep. The clam chowder was probably one of the best clam chowders I've ate so far. My Cajun Pasta looked stunning but it didn't taste like it was worth 11 dollars. After I finished my meal  I waited another 15-20 minutes for a waitress arrive with the check. I just wasted an hour of my life just waiting for food to come and the check to leave. The food was alright but BJ's gotta step up with their service.
Saori H.,La Puente  CA,203,20,1,10/16/2010,5.0,"Came here last night with my bf and a couple of friends. I was sooooo excited about this placeeeee!! The ambiance was pretty incredible  a little more moody and intimate than the other Bj\'s that I remember... Anyways  they have plenty of servers and hosts to help everyone. Their beer list is AMAZINN!!!! from light to dark beer and also ciders and cocktails!I ordered the Hawaiian ale  Longboard beer (about 6 bucks?). It suited my taste pretty well  as i love the fruity aroma! (Hef FTW!) My boyfriend and boss (?) ordered the Gulden Draac (also about 6 bucks) (*whatever the spell is) beer. Looked like pepsi  but I think it was 10%  which really made our dining convo\'s interesting ;)As for the food  you cant go wrong with the pizzas there. Nice and crunchy crust with generous amounts of veggies and meat. I ordered the salad called ""Field of Greens""( bout $10)  which I highly recommend! Fruity (again lol) and with a pretty big portion. it has feta  roasted tomatoes  candied walnuts and raspberry vinagrette~~~~"
Andrew Y.,Hacienda Heights  CA,349,174,111,3/3/2011,3.0,The Skinny: New location and the venue is quite large. Service is okay in that they serve you food and you're happy to eat.The Fat: Went here for birthday dinner on a Sunday night. CROWDED. I forgot to reserve a table so was a bit of a wait.Server mixed up on a drink and pizookie order.Food was greasy as always with any restaurant but the deep dish pizza was delicious! The drinks were pretty good. I ordered the snakebite but it was disgusting. They had the top layer as Guinness and the bottom with Fruit Cider. BLEH. Didn't read carefully. The Snakebites in London are better...I should of just ordered Guiness!Overall  a standard Bj's that still needs some conditioning and work but it's a great place for food.
Ronald R.,West Covina  CA,326,174,549,7/10/2012,4.0,I love BJs. No pun intended... LOL But anyways  the food is great  and not so bad for your buck. The customer service here is really good. My boyfriend and I came here one night for dessert and we sat at the bar  and the bartender was really friendly. She helped me out with what pizookie to get  and ended up just getting half of two flavors! Perfect so I didn't have to decide with just one! I really like the set up at this location. It is smaller than most BJs  but it's still in a good location.
Phyllis L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,81,42,1,2/27/2011,5.0,Spinach stuffed mushrooms are delish!The Mediterranean pizza is pretty good. But what I really come here for is the dessert:The Pizookie Trio - white chocolate macadamia nut  cookies n cream  and chocolate chunkWhite chocolate macadamia nut is my favorite =PTheir root beer is awesome too =]
Ronny D.,Whittier  CA,1,40,19,5/22/2013,5.0,Ok so today me   my ol lady and our friend  came for late lunch. Food was amazing but what stood out to me was my server. Oh I forget her name though. White girl with glasses and super friendly. She was one of the best servers i have ever had. Roast beef dip sandwich was great! The only thing I would change about BJs is that they need to sell their Sodas to go.
Chris C.,La Habra  CA,350,219,52,12/4/2010,3.0,Great place to chill... huge menu..Great White Pizza!! Chicken Wings!!Avocado Rolls!!It's BJ's. You know what's up. **P.S They make a mean zombie :P
Jay K.,Los Angeles  CA,1130,338,660,1/2/2011,4.0,"Outstanding SERVICE! Kudo\'s to BJ\'s service trainers  they do an awesome job in setting the standard. No matter which restaurant I go  I find the service to be polite  friendly  attentive  but not overbearing. Reminds me how find dining is like. I never found my cup empty  every request was ""absolutely"".DECOR was fantastic. A lot of thought went into the interior design. A modern industrial revolution motif. Lots of dark wood and steel. Big style points from me. FOOD is decent  standard corporate mid-upper scale fair. You can expect the typical yuppie Americana selection  topped steak  signature burgers  hearty salads  gourmet pizza  etc. On par with Gordon and Birch. A tad better than Chili\'s  comparable to California Pizza Kitchen and Cheese Cake Factory. A bit rich and a tad salty I say.DRINKS  I\'m sorry I didn\'t have a chance to sample their well  but it looks fun. TIP: It\'s great for dates  group socials  watching the game  happy hour. Thumbs up and smiles for the service and decor!"
Gary W.,Los Angeles  CA,5,7,,7/26/2012,1.0,This f'ing BJ's sucks balls. The service sucks. My friend order a steak dinner medium rare and our came out well done. I ordered a country fried steak asms asked for more gravy and this guy forgot about our. The server is very forgetful. The fucking server didn't come by to refill our glasses with water. We even waited more than 20 mins for our food. Beware of the server George. He's a f'ing flaker!!!
Desiree H.,Glendora  CA,151,117,211,11/14/2012,5.0,Perfect for a late night dessert!! The strawberry beignet was delicious! Just the right amount of people after 11pm to make this a perfect dessert date place!
Merrill L.,Alhambra  CA,24,43,,6/8/2013,4.0,Choice of deep dish or normal 'zahs. The hand crafted sodas are awesome  and the appetizers are phenomenal too! And great service.
Tulip L.,Long Beach  CA,552,77,272,1/6/2011,3.0,PROS:-this place is huge! and i like the decoration-the works are all very inexperienced  but i can tell their trying their best and their all very sweet so keep it up!-happy hour! alot of dishes fall in the 3-8$ range during this time-their cream soda! devine!CONS:-SO FREAKING GREASY. yuck. the mac n cheese i ordered was swimming around in oil-like johnson's said below me  the food gets old real fast.
Chase B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,107,25,2,4/11/2012,1.0,The service here is horrible. Each and every time. Without fail. I go in around 11 pm more or less for a snack and to hang out with friends  by this time the bar is only open. Now there are about 4 open booths  however none of them are clean  and the manager is busy talking and not caring about anyone else expect her conversation. After waiting 10 minutes in the lobby  right when she was about to walk right past me with no eye contact  I had to discuss my concern. Overall  the food is fine  but this BJ's does not deserves your money  time  or business.
Gil G.,West Covina  CA,55,20,12,12/29/2010,4.0,Unlike others  this BJ's doesn't have Mountain Dew. However the facility is nice  the TVs are evenly spread and tuned into great channels. The drinks were a little too strong. And it wreaked of Rowland Heights' populous. Many of the waitresses were literally standing for 20 minutes talking to other guests. I recommend this place to anyone who loves BJs as a restaraunt  not as a bar  and anyone who loves boba  internet cafes  and anime.
Joey H.,Los Angeles  CA,62,320,3,5/27/2014,5.0,in my opinion bj's has the best pizza. theres something about the crust that keeps me coming back. me  my son and my mom all shared a large vegetarian. we all enjoyed it. we also shared an order of avocado wraps. we enjoyed that too. the service was friendly and the place is clean. great time there.
Jenny C.,Los Angeles  CA,269,313,404,2/4/2012,1.0,Service here is god awful even when it's empty  and their drinks are weak. I think my ice cubes at home can get me drunker than their cocktails.
John T.,Rowland Heights  CA,110,63,116,10/11/2010,4.0,"Came here on their ""soft open"" for friends and family. I just happened to stumbled in and was lucky enough to talk my way in since we weren\'t invited. Not knowing what was going on  one hostess was giving us issues. She had to talk to management  and was sat in an unfavorable place...the handicap bar seating. But my colleague and I didn\'t mind.As mentioned  it was a test run  and was told that the menus are set for different areas so we didn\'t have the full menu available to where we sat. I inquired why we only get a partial menu. The bartender explained to us as the kitchen needed to familiar with cooking the menu items. Fair enough.Food: good...the usual BJ quality  but we were limited to a few sandwich/burger items and pizza\'s. Still good though.Beers: I like beer but can only take a few as it gets me really full fast. But some reason  I kept trying the varieties they had...5 of them. So full!Service: Great! Especially the bartenders. They were very helpful and attentive. Their was even one asian female bartender that was on the other end of the bar to check if we were ok and asked how was the food. I said due to limited menu selection  we shared an entree. She inquired why  each person is entitle to the free meal tonight! Me  whaaa? ""Yes  the entire meal tonight is free as we are running a test of the kitchen. Only the alcohol are charged"". Damn  set us up with another entree!Though she was not our bartender  she was nice enough to tell us what\'s the 411 with the night. Gave extra tip just for that...service!I\'m lookin\' to head back there as its hella close to home!"
Patrick M.,Monrovia  CA,11,232,12,10/9/2012,4.0,Since BJ's has become mainstream  it seems that the food quality has suffered a little bit. The beer is still good as always. This place is always a good place to hang out with friends and catch a football game (if you get there early enough). This BJ's is bigger than some of the others I've been to. Service is decent.
Francis F.,Hacienda Heights  CA,9,40,1,11/7/2010,4.0,This restaurant is new to this area  but I've been to the one in Covina(?) many times  and think the place is great. I normally get the pizzas  and I did get myself a Root Beer  but this time around  I got the fish tacos. And they were good  the food rarely disappoints as I've tried almost everything on the menu.Service was good  no complaints there  and the atmosphere was loud but in a good way. I'm not a drinker  so I have no opinions on their beers  but the times I went with my friends who had the beer  they seemed to like the variety and the flavor. I don't know how they do it.All in all  a good experience  good food  and good times.
Leila A.,La Puente  CA,11,55,1,4/3/2012,1.0,No Stars for this place due to the terrible service they always provide. The food is really good  but the service sucks all the time. I won't be back to the West Covina location ever again. I rather go to chili's because they provide good service.
Debbie S.,Hacienda Heights  CA,104,14,,5/22/2013,4.0,Fun  fun place! The microbrews are great  and they always have a good game on their many screens including one that is 104 inches!!  The food is pretty good  typical chain restaurant fair. The to go orders are always quick and on time  and you can also order a large Jeremiah Red which is delicious! The enlightened menu has healthy and tasty items such as Morocco Salmon and Cajun Tilapia
Daniel Z.,La Puente  CA,119,39,9,1/10/2011,2.0,This place is always packed during the normal rush hour dinner times expecially during the weekend. It seems that everytime i go to this location i have a problem. They are a little unorganized First visit  Somehow they gave my pizza to someone else so i had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make one and give it to me. Second visit they gave my table to a party that arrived after we had arrived RIGHT INFRONT OF US and to make matters worse they did NOT have any more tables avaible for about another 15-20 minutes  I overheard the conversations between the employees and they messed up but told the manager they had a SYSTEM GLITCH! i spoke to the manager and they sat me down at some table probably meant for 8-10 people on some corner which was ok but felt awkward. they should have made this location bigger but what can you do?
Cheryl N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,122,12,11/12/2012,5.0,I really like BJ's. I always have great service here. My husband and I usually order an appetizer  pizza  and dessert. Sometimes  we order drinks too. They have specialty beers that my husband likes. I like their specials  for example  there was a $20.00 special for two soups or salads  medium pizza  and a pizookie. So much food! We are on facebook  so they usually post their specials/discounts there. On the weekends  there is about a 15 minute wait. Parking is plentiful  you can also park in the back if you can't find a spot. Also a great place for happy hour.
Synthia C.,Chino Hills  CA,90,4,,11/17/2013,1.0,"My family and I frequently eat at Bj\'s (at least 1-2 times a month). We usually go to the Chino Hills or Brea locations but were at the Puente Hills location last night. The night started out a little roughly - my beer took a very long time to come and my fork was dirty (looked like someone already ate a pizookie with it) but it was nothing worth complaining about. However  when our food came my mom\'s Mahi Mahi was so overcooked that the edges were burnt. She gets this every time we go and knew that it isn\'t usually cooked like that so she sent it back to be remade. Then our friends started eating their pizza only to find that they forgot to put sauce on it. When the waiter returned with the new fish  we saw that it was once again burned on the edges and overcooked. We asked to speak to the manager about our food so he brought him over. We informed the manager of the fish and the pizza. He offered to bring out a new pizza but since they were hungry they said it wasn\'t necessary  but if he could just bring them a side of sauce. He told us he would personally go get the sauce and NEVER CAME BACK. My mom did not eat the fish  they left the rest of the pizza and at the end of the meal the manager brought us our check with a 20 dollar comp card ""to be used at our next visit""  said nothing about the sauce he never brought  and didn\'t even ask how the rest of our meal was. He seemed eager to drop the bill and leave. When we looked at it we saw that he charged us for the fish and the pizza anyway. We told our server that he never even brought sauce and we didn\'t eat the fish and he was understanding and said he would take the bill to the manager to be fixed. When the waiter finally returned nothing about the bill changed and he just apologized again about the food. We put the 20 dollar comp card in the bill and told him to use it now because we would not be returning. The manager never returned to our table and said nothing to us when we passed him on our way out. We are not usually the type to complain  but I asked our waiter to inform the manager that I would be complaining about him specifically because his managing skills were awful and he did nothing to redeem a very disappointing experience. We are always happy with our visits to the Chino Hills and Brea locations but because of that manager we will not be returning to this location and we will advise other friends and family against it as well. The manager I have mentioned is Mark Hester. Hopefully this review is a wake up call that his managing skills leave much to be desired."
Erik C.,La Puente  CA,1,9,1,2/9/2013,1.0,Oh man this place sucked balls after 2 times the 3rd time we went our food was sooo crappy...and man not to mention the 3rd time when my cousin found a long hair in his food and our food was half ass cooked...and the dam weighter took my beer cup like half way full ...but I just didn't say any thing...ill never go here again...the one star is for the 2 first times we went and it was ok...but never again..
Simone V.,West Covina  CA,156,137,190,9/9/2011,1.0,"First time I\'ve been to this BJs location with hopes of good service and food like their other locations  but OMG this had to be the worse service ever! The guy we had was a total idiot! And that\'s being nice. When we first got settled in  one of my friends was coming back from the restroom and she noticed another table near us left a note after they had left  ""You suck."" Our first thought was  that\'s not nice  but after the crappy service this guy gave us  we definitely understood what that table meant. First off he keeps forgetting to get our water we ordered along with our drinks. There were 3 of us and he comes back  after reminding him a few times  with 2 cups of water with no ice. WTF? We only ordered the mac n cheese and a medium great white pizza. Now here\'s the kicker too  for the mac n cheese  he brings out 3 small plates for us to share the small appetizer  but for the pizza  he brings out 2 dinner plates. Okay  by this time I\'m thinking  ""Can this guy count?"" Hello?! There was 3 of us. Next was the drinks... my friend had ordered a shot of chilled patron  and we had to remind him several times and his response was  ""I\'ll check with the bar.""  but never comes back with the drink. It got to the point where I had to wave down another server and ask him to help us. And that server brought it right out and helped take additional drink orders from us. Our server keeps asking us if we need a box when we are in midst of conversation with more than 1/2 a pizza still uneaten and we keep telling him ""We\'re still working on it."" It got to the point when we finally said fine  get us a box after he came back asking us again and he doesn\'t come back with the box till another 20 minutes. WTH? My friend had to tell him that he never came out with her drink and that we had to flag someone else to help us and his excuse  ""O  there was a really big party  sorry."" So you can remember to bring out the big party their order  but not our small party of 3? LAME excuse. Will I be back to this location.... I\'ll pass."
P T.,Hermosa Beach  CA,45,32,5,2/9/2011,4.0,Had the Blackened salmon lunch special  and a small BJ's Special pizza...Negatives: Pizza had a little bit too much oil on the outside pan area...Fish was well seasoned  and veggies were okay  but thought the portion was little bit too small compared to Mimi's Cafe... And pricing seemed a couple of bucks too high  but maybe they have coupons somewhere....Positives: Nice interior  lots of sports to watch  clean bathrooms.... Also has large banquet area. Overall a good place for binge drinking.
Peter D.,Los Angeles  CA,392,602,241,11/20/2011,3.0,Pizzas are thick and chunky. Not NY for sure. Definitely closer to Chicago. Not bad for a chain. I haven't been here in a while and noticed they upped the menu. Horseshoe fries and burgers are good  especially the Crispy Jalapeno. I'd recommend a couple shared appetizers: Santa Fe Spring Rolls are my favorite there. The Shrimp Lettuce Wraps aren't bad either nor are the stuff mushrooms. They even have a gluten-free selection.
Sheila M.,Walnut  CA,79,12,3,9/10/2011,1.0,"Three strikes  this place is definitely out. 1st visit:- server NEVER refilled our beverages  we had to ask a bus boy  twice- we cancelled our appetizer because our main entrees came out first  then got charged for it anyway  with no apology- we had to ask twice for our check and finally walked up to the host desk to get it  still no apology- we let the manager on duty know  he thanked us for telling him  and by golly  still no apology2nd visit (by far the worst):- the first thing our server said was ""hi  we\'re understaffed tonight  so the food will take longer to come out...do you still want to eat here?"" (I should have said no and just left) - when we asked him for a refill he said ""sure  but I\'m not your server anymore  I was just covering a break""- it took way too long for every person in a BJ\'s uniform to figure out who our server was supposed to be...all the while we just stared as our first server approached all of the other servers practically begging them to come help us- somebody finally came by to apologize and said ""I guess I\'ll be helping you for the rest of the night. Sorry  your table was never assigned to anybody.... what did you want?""3rd visit:- we sat for 12 minutes (yes  I counted this time) before the server first approached us- there were only 2 servers covering 8 tables  2 of which were large parties of 12+  so naturally  everything was slow- server forgot to order the appetizer  then blamed it on the kitchen- the soup was lukewarm- server poured iced tea into my dad\'s diet coke- they were out of sugar bowls  so our server had to ask a table next to us if they needed theirs  then took it and set it down on our table. When I asked for splenda  she said she would have to find a table that had splenda in the sugar bowls  do I want equal instead? (uhh  no... go find me splenda)- there were 5 different servers/bus boys/runners who had to help us with refills  napkins  extra sides  etc... and each person we asked acted as if we were a burden- our server initially charged us for the pazooki that was supposed to be on the house for our horrible serviceI came back and cut them some slack because they had just opened  and I love BJ\'s pizza and beer... but the lack of training  and frankly  the lack of CARING is unacceptable and not deserving of a 4th chance. I\'ll drive the extra miles to West Covina  Brea  or Chino Hills."
Vita S.,Hacienda Heights  CA,64,177,24,3/26/2012,2.0,Wow. Service here is bad. Very unexperienced staff for sure!
Stacy H.,Walnut  CA,124,84,134,9/16/2011,1.0,We got seated. To get our drinks took FOREVER. It isn't that busy. Think maybe they might need more employees to get this process going. Usually I don't wait that long.. I'm a very patient person but this is way too long. Service sucks lot tonight. I ordered a shot. They couldn't make. Then I asked for a cactus cooler shot. And they couldn't make it. This place isn't the greatest. Go somewhere else if ur going to drink.
zoe h.,Walnut  CA,3,5,,5/22/2014,3.0,This is my favorite BJs at all time. But the waiter for tonite really killed my mood to have a few sips. This Bruce send us the check right after the first round like he's busy running to the door. He's too busy drop off checks but forgot to clean our table. And probably too busy to take our order as well. Anyway  we still had a blast but it could be even better if he's not serving our table.
Andrew H.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,3,,2/16/2013,4.0,I didn't expect much because of so many negative reviews on this location including how horrible the parking was  how long the wait for the food was  and how racist the servers are...Well  I had a great experience at this BJ's last night. I went to eat dinner on a Friday night and they said I needed to wait 15-20 minutes. Ended up getting seated within 10 minutes. The place was packed so I thought my orders were gonna take a long time but nope! Food came out really fast. Appetizers came out within 5 minutes and the pizza came out under 10 minutes. Also our waiter was really friendly and polite. Overall a great dinner!
David K.,El Monte  CA,143,113,65,6/7/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Unless you come for beer  the food is just average - not great and not bad - nothing really special to rave about. The service is good but a little slow. Come to enjoy time with friends not when you have limited time.
Ryan B.,Rowland Heights  CA,284,27,3,10/9/2010,5.0,This is a new BJ's next to the 60 freeway where black angus used to lie. We have been waiting for a long time for this to open and I'm glad to say that the usual service from Bj's is not lost on this new location. I ordered the Avocado Eggrolls and spinach artichoke pizza with a friend. Both were delicious as usual but who ever is cooking the pizza they were more delicious then normal. Also I am not just saying that because I was hungry I had eaten earlier. The waiting staff is surprisingly well trained for a restaurant that only opened a week ago and were quick about refilling drinks asking us how we were doing etc. They also did not hover over our table which at times can be fairly annoying. My only qualm is that parking which is albeit plentiful is a bit of a problem you may want to park at red lobster next door because parking at the peak hour I went was pretty bad. All in all a very good dining experience and I will be back soon.
Lana L.,Los Angeles  CA,10,848,61,3/18/2013,2.0,Out of all the restaurants around this place  I have no idea why I decided to come here. Don't get me wrong  the service wasn't bad but the food  Eh! Thank goodness I only got the all you can eat salad/soup lunch special under $10
Sam K.,Diamond Bar  CA,113,28,9,8/11/2012,1.0,Horrible service!!!!!! Waited 45 minutes for our LUNCH to come out!!! I ordered chicken breast with pasta and gf ordered cajun pasta. Serious?! 45 minutes??? If you want to eat here for lunch you should come by 11am so you can start eating by 12!!
Lexine L.,Covina  CA,226,3,2,9/10/2012,5.0,This place is AMAZING!! Everybody is sooooo nice. Especially the hostesses (*cough*alex*cough*)!!!! I'm a regular and each day I get something new and it never ceases to please my palet. I love BJ's! Gold standard heck yeah :D
Chris A.,Los Angeles  CA,400,243,2088,5/8/2011,2.0,"Although we got seated right away on a busy Saturday night  the table service wasn\'t the greatest. My friend and I only came in to get some dessert  but we had 3 different waiter/waitresses. The first waitress was the friendliest  but she only brought us water. Then the next waiter was rather rude and gave some attitude. He seemed unwilling to take our order and kept dismissing our questions to make it seem like we didn\'t know what we wanted. We were finally able to order our Pizookie Trio with the chocolate chunk  white macadamia nut  and oatmeal raisin cookies  but soon thereafter the waiter went on his ""lunch"" break and we had another waitress. Neither of the last two came by to check on us or even refill our water. Also  the pizookie tastes better in a party platter rather than the 3 minis in the trio because it\'s easier to get the cookie out and the 3 mini tins that it\'s served on slides around on the big plate that all 3 are placed on. The satisfaction came in the taste though  BJs is pretty consistent with their pizookies  just not the service."
Wayne K.,Walnut  CA,274,56,30,3/15/2011,3.0,Wow the menu is different from the one in Brea so it threw me for a little. Miss some of the regular items they had on the menu but you can ask and at times they can still get some of the classics.
Dennis G.,Rio Rancho  NM,0,4,,6/14/2014,4.0,I would give bj's a 5... My problem was the waitress .. We got an appetizer .. Oops I forgot you plates .. Our meal included a salad .. The meal got to the table before the salad .. Oops I forgot refill drinks .. On a Saturday at 11:30 ... Seriously? ... The food was delish.. And I will go back .. Hopefully a new waitress..
Jackie L.,Rowland Heights  CA,102,5,,6/1/2012,1.0,"The last time there with an order of BBQ chicken pizza and found one of the slices was extremely different than others  instead of chicken  tomatoes and onions on it  it was just a piece of cheezy overburnt dough hardly ignored. In addition to that  their store manager\'s attitude. He came to our table shout out loud and started ""Telling"" us that they all looked exactly the same to him. At the same time of yelling  he was also demostrating how it looked the same by picking up the chicken and tomatoes from other good slices to the ""Dough"" to show us the similarity of them  then move the chicken and tomatoes back to the good ones to tell us why they looked differently  and then attemping to do the same ""demostration"" all over again until I asked him to stop playing with the food I paid for. I personally think both of the service and food quality has way to much need to improve."
Nichole R.,Walnut  CA,270,13,,11/8/2012,1.0,"The past two times I\'ve been there have been HORRIBLE! The first time was with a large group. Our waitress was flat out rude to the younger (high school) kids in the group. They are not loud and obnoxiously rude kids  so I don\'t understand why she had attitude. Anyways  at the end we get our bill and notice we were charged for extra stuff (which happens) so the manager fixes it and says ""OK  this is your new total "" So everyone pays and once we have the amount they all start leaving since their parents were there to pick them up. Now It\'s just a few of us left and the manager comes back and says ""Oh! sorry I forgot to add tax and tip."" Uh....everyone is already gone and he said ""this is your new total."" It\'s not our fault he messed up. Finally we had enough and my friend let\'s him know it. She wasn\'t going to bring up the rude waitress but we had enough. In the end (after he argued with my friend) we ended up having to pay and he gave her a $10 gift card to ""make it better""Second time (I don\'t even know why we went back) it was a much smaller group of 7. Our waitress was only waiting on two tables but we were there for over 2 hours. It took a little over a half hour for our orders to be taken  about the same time to get our food  then what seemed like FOREVER to get our bill which we only got because someone had to get up and find our waitress and ask her after we waited for about 45 minutes AFTER we finished eating and plates were already collected.Again  a friend goes to the manager and he starts giving excuses. He was a lovely man though! A lot more polite than the previous one we had to deal with. Still  he did nothing about it.I think we are done with this place."
Raquel R.,Los Angeles  CA,348,500,313,11/14/2011,4.0,BJ's is always good for a quick lunch and of course beer!
Brittany T.,Cerritos  CA,1,13,1,5/3/2014,1.0,"Came here tonight with my fiance. We get seated and ""Lawrence"" is our waiter. So there is no smile from Lawrence he doesn\'t even look us in the eye and we sat in a booth so when he took our drink orders he had his back to me! Ewww! We drank our drinks really fast cuz we were so thirsty ...but we got our main dishe before we got our first refill! Now what is sadder about all of this is that Lawrence was raking the order behind us and the table on the other side of us too..but not once did he stop to ask if we wanted refills. So some sweet guy came out from the back to bring us our pizza we ordered (forgot his name)...i had to ask him for refills  plates and our appetizer!!! Seriously what restaurant brings out your main dish firdt and appetizer after that??? What\'s the point of an appetizer? I work in food/customer service industry and this server was really bad at attaining to his guests. This service was horrible. Won\'t be coming bak to this location!"
Luis C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,13,7,9/3/2012,4.0,Last night was our very first time at BJ's...service and food was great...would definitely go back again!
Aubrey J.,Los Angeles  CA,40,229,673,4/26/2013,3.0,the food is great and all BUT THE SERVICE WILL ALWAYS SUCK HERE. they are really slow... =( but that doesn't stop my friends and i from coming here hahaha. good vibes  good drinks  good food. that's it =) i'm REALLY glad they opened up this BJ's near home for sure. oreo pizookie ftw!
Ryan C.,Monterey Park  CA,206,297,35,9/24/2011,2.0,Came here to celebrate a birthday.Got seated pretty fast but the food took over half an hour to come to our table which seemed odd  because it was not that crowded.When the food came it was barely warm room temperature.I got the Texas chicken steak which had hardly any gravy at all.It was so bland.The vegetables weren't even cooked it was like eating raw vegetables.Service was ok.Next time I would rather make the drive to Claim Jumper in Brea. I hope not all BJs are this terrible!
Belange H.,Salt Lake City  UT,58,246,301,8/31/2011,4.0,Very fresh Salmon  the veggies and rice was also cooked to perfection. Liked the ambiance of the place as well as the beer selection. The mojito was a bit bland  but the service and entree were great.
JJ A.,Rowland Heights  CA,133,55,3,1/18/2011,4.0,A small BJ's restaurant. Great variety in a place when most restaurants around the area offer practically the same thing. Great drinks with moderate pricing. Waiting time can get annoying so take advantage of the reservation seating (call it in). Must be there with half the party of your reservation is forfeited (no mercy)
S M.,Hacienda Heights  CA,5,30,3,10/12/2011,2.0,The food here is not too good. Really the only reason to come in are the drinks and appetizers. Otherwise if your looking for a great dinner nite make plans elsewhere.
Aileen C.,Diamond Bar  CA,233,105,13,2/3/2011,4.0,YAAY! BJ's near my work! I love their beer sampler  you can get the variety of 4 BJ's select beers for a decent price. The portions are just enough for you to enjoy the taste and want to move on to the next one. I recently tried their grilled chicken slider which is absolutely delicious! The grilled chicken itself is not that big  but the taste is enough to enjoy. I also tried their Miso Salmon lunch special  but I would not recommend it since it's probably comparable to a microwave dinner. The beer  appetizer menu and pizza is what I would suggest sticking to.
Shayne H.,Long Beach  CA,3,68,6,9/5/2013,1.0,Okay  let me start from the top. We arrived just before 10pm and were hungry and happy as clams that they were open until 1. I'd never been to BJ's but my fianc has and gave it rave reviews so I wanted to try it out. Total flop! They told us it was a 10 minute wait to be seated. For a Friday night  it wasn't that busy so I just assumed they were short staffed. We decided to have a seat at the bar and prime the ol' pump. I ordered a Modelo and my better half ordered a michelada. Now  a michelada is half beer  half spicy clamado then done. It was horrible. Too much spice  too little tomato juice. Ordinarily I don't bitch about drinks in reviews but for $9 for something I can make at home for far less  I have certain expectations. They weren't met. So  we continued waiting for a table. After 15 minutes  I went over and asked the host if our table was ready and she said yeah  we called you. Oh really? How? Did you send out carry pigeons and we happened to miss them? Didn't hear our names shouted  they didn't give us a buzzer thing  nothing. So we finally get seated. We sat there  decided what we wanted and then waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for a server to show up  all the while  numerous servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. So Michael finally came by  didn't offer us water  took our order and disappeared. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and Buffalo style chicken wontons  and the chicken bacon ranch pizza. 20 minutes later  a different server brings our pizza to the table and asked if it was ours. We said yeah  but we want our appetizers first (DUH!) so she offers to take it and put it in the warmer for us. Literally a second after she leaves  a THIRD server brings our apps. Both tasted fine but were lukewarm. What the hell is going on around here!? Michael then asks if he can bring our pizza back  we say yeah. The pizza was good but lacked the right amount of ranch to balance it with the bacon and chicken. Overall  the food was better than average. But for the cost  it should have been really GOOD. The service? Well  it's pretty obvious how we feel. Sorry BJ's  you failed us.
David C.,West Covina  CA,1,6,,1/23/2012,1.0,Worst place ever! This place gave me food poisoning/stomach flu. No bs! I ordered a medium well steak and it came to me @ medium rare. They took it back and the chef was probably pissed off and gave me back a contaminated steak. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE!!!!
Mark W.,Hacienda Heights  CA,15,16,5,1/31/2011,1.0,The BJs out in Brea was much better. The service here was horrible  especially for Sunday brunch when the place was empty. Took about an hour to get our food  refills took forever and they kept mixing up our drinks  they got our orders wrong and ended up charging us for something they never brought out even after we canceled it and told them to take it off our order. I ordered a Jambalaya and the shrimp and rice tasted like it came from a microwave meal. Much improvement needed.
Devrae C.,West Covina  CA,2,18,,11/19/2011,5.0,Been here a few times and each time was pretty good  good food good service! Love the wedge fries with ranch!
Jonathan P.,Los Angeles  CA,448,184,91,4/21/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Looks like they've cleaned up their act. Last few times I've gone have been much better experiences. The bartenders are amazing and the staff is friendly and prompt.
H C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,68,45,51,11/11/2010,2.0,This review is mainly for the awful service!  I've been to this place twice. Once a month earlier when it was just me and the hubby for a late night dessert and snack. When we arrive  our waiter was on break so another server took our drink and food orders. The drinks came out and after about 10 minutes  we got curious where our 'real' waiter was and wondered about our food. After asking around to the other passing servers and then going to the hostess  'our' waiter finally showed up. No apologies from him about being MIA. We knew this place just opened  so we chalked it up to training and hoped it'll be better next time we come. Well  it's didn't get better. My girlfriends and I came for lunch to celebrate a bunch of birthdays last week on a busy Friday afternoon. It took 30 minutes after our drinks were ordered before the waitress came back to take our food orders. We tried to get others to help us but they told us they'll look for her. Then  as we were talking to the manager  she showed up! During the 30 minutes we were waiting for her  other servers came by multiple times with beer and food we didn't order. We kept sending them away. They looked so confused just standing in the middle of the room trying to figure out their next steps. When our food did arrive  a person in our party didn't get hers b/c they said her order was mistakenly taken by another server...yeah  no surprise. Then they brought a dessert to our table while we were still eating and said 'is there a birthday' here? Yes...but we're still eating our meal! Seriously  this has to be one of the worst service experience I've ever had in a restaurant. There were so many problems  it was funny. I have to blame the management for all these issues. They've been opened well over a month and management should have ironed out these issues during that time. I won't be going back to dine at this location...maybe take out?
Nick G.,Bloomfield Hills  MI,30,26,2,7/4/2011,2.0,Terrible service. Inconsistent food. Pass if you can.
Norville G.,La Puente  CA,618,7,2,10/31/2010,1.0,"**UPDATE** 12/28/2010In my review below the dotted line I gave it a three stars. That was me being generous. Since I posted my review I came back here a couple more times.  My last visit was last night. And let me tell you.  Service has gotten a lot worse.  We had a group of 5 people at the bar area. We ordered beer and food of course. It took them 30 minutes to deliver our beverages (it wasn\'t even busy) and on top of that I ordered a bread bowl of clam chowder which came to me 1hr after order and it was friggin COOOOOLD!!!! Who the hell serves cold Clam Chowder. So  I called our waitress and asked her to exchange it for a hot clam chowder and she responded with the most annoying attitude and replied ""You know what? we don\'t have anymore soup so I\'ll just knock it off your check."" And did she apologize??? NOPE!! I am sick off getting shitty ass service here and we are never ever ever coming back!! I hope this BJ\'s burns down!!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First impression from the outside was that it was the best looking Bj\'s i\'ve ever seen. Upon entering the atmosphere is one of a kind. The lighting and the set up of the interior is very versatile. You can bring a date their and have it be romantic or you can bring your family and friends and have a good time. Their food and drinks is YUMMMMMMY!!! Happy hour is great there. Half off mini pizzas!!!! =) As for their service  I came here a couple of times and the service is a hit or miss. One out of the three times I came here the service was superb. Two out of three times that I came here the service was either mediocre or just really bad! I am really not that strict when critiquing on service but the last time I came it was horrible! It took the waitress 15 minutes to serve us drinks. When we ordered appetizers it took over 30 minutes to come out because the waitress forgot to put in the order. And all we ordered was an order of the fried calamaris. We placed the order the same time we ordered the calamari and it took an hour to get our food! And the waitress did apologize nor even bother to come every now and then to check how we were doing. The other waitresses had to pick up her slack. At one point I saw our waitress texting in the corner of the room? WTF?!?!?! Conclusion:::: FOOD GREAT! DRINKS GREAT! (Recommend Gulden Draak)SERVICE Fire that damn waitress and hire servers that can better represent your restaurant. I would\'ve given it 5 stars but servers there are is horrible at times."
Vivian Q.,San Antonio  TX,144,197,725,11/18/2010,5.0,The turkey cobb sandwich w/shoestring fries and wedge salad was out of this world. You also must try their locally. Brewed rootbeer and orange creme soda - just super duper good!
Kristen V.,Los Angeles  CA,61,73,2,1/6/2011,3.0,Went here last night. For the past couple of years  I've made it my mission to go to every BJ's location I can. So far I've been to more than 10. I'm always a fan of their food  but lately BJ's has failed to impress me with their beer selection. I can only order so many pitchers of Jeremiah red  or Octoberfest! I keep thinking they'll bring out a BETTER beer for the season  but same ol' thing. . .disappointing. I also found this location to be a bit small. Service was good though and as mentioned  I never have anything bad to say about their food!!
Jess P.,Las Vegas  NV,52,273,59,1/5/2011,5.0,You go to BJ's for beer and pizookie- THAT'S IT! and that exactly what I had...I'm glad a BJ's opened up in the area; now the over 21 crowd but not quite married have a cool place to chill. check it out!
Brian L.,Cypress  CA,5,10,1,9/27/2011,3.0,came here today for lunch and ordered pizza  calamari  and beer.loved pizza and beer but calamari was horrible....calamari was cut too big and cold.. And I had to wait long time for a server to bring the menues.
Peter C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,218,217,154,1/18/2011,4.0,"I used to have to drive to other BJ restaurants  but there is one now that\'s more convenient. I really like their regular deep dish pizzas and their pizookies (dessert). However  don\'t order their appetizer style pizza! I ordered an Italian sausage pizza and when it arrives  I thought they made a mistake because all I can see is a plain thin crust pizza. After asking the service staff to make sure he didn\'t bring to me the wrong order  it IS the right one - the ""sausages"" are the tiny black spots on the pizza that I\'ll have to use a magnifying glass to see! On the other hand  their Avocado Egg Roll appetizer is really  really good. Highly recommended."
Angela L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,52,6,10,4/5/2011,1.0,"The BJ\'s here by the Puente Hills Mall is horrible! DO NOT GO THERE! I went with my family and fiance\'s family  so we had a big table.. The waiter seem to be new  so okay we had patience. This place was extremely crowded and you need to almost yell to carry a conversation. It took us 40 minutes to get our food and then out appetizers came AFTER our food. Okay  whatever  put up with it. Then when we were going to pay the bill it took the waiter 40 minutes and he couldn\'t even do it. So  he had his manager come to our table and tell us that they do not know how to process a VISA giftcard.Then the manager (Asian dude with glasses) started telling us that it was our fault that we paid with a VISA giftcard and that perhaps there wasn\'t enough on there. BS because it was a brand new visa giftcard. Then the manager started to ROLL his eyes at us and questioned us ""okay  so what do you want me to do......"" WTF service is that. He didn\'t apologize and didn\'t even attempt to ameliorate the situation. He was constantly being on the defensive side and giving the sense of blowing us off. All in all  I would NEVER recommend anyone to this place. The service is horrible  the manging sucks  the food wasn\'t that great either. Save your money and go else where!"
Melody L.,Los Angeles  CA,108,274,9,3/28/2011,4.0,My boyfriend and I frequently visit this place. They have wonderful pizzas and burgers. There are a lot of people who come here so sometimes the wait is ridiculous. However  I call in first and then go there and wait a little bit of time. My boyfriend always gets a pizza and I always get the pazookie for us to share(: It's delicious  however  this place is a little more on the expensive side. The bar looks wonderful though and it seems that they have a lot of selections. Their soups are good and so are their salads  but what they're really known for is for the pizzas so I would definitely recommend getting a pizza here.
Stephane L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,4,17,4,3/15/2012,4.0,Nice place to hang out. The location is kind of hidden  so its not extremely busy most of the times. The bar is a goood spot to watch sports and drink...woohoo!
Sarah L.,Los Angeles  CA,62,19,11,12/9/2011,1.0,This BJ's SUCKS!! Don't go here. The service is slow and the waiters never come to your table.
Andrew S.,Hacienda Heights  CA,180,32,3,11/24/2010,4.0,Been here many times already.Ivan the waiter is awesome.Normally we sit in the bar area and have a few drinks.Nice to have a place locally with some decent beer selection.Root beer and cream soda are also tasty.
Eddie V.,Lakewood  CA,128,87,74,10/17/2010,4.0,Busy as all heck. I guess thats what you get when you come on a weekend. Small wait to be seated. I'm a big BJ's fan so I ordered some wings to start off while my Mediteranean Pizza is being made. Always a good choice. Service was pretty good considering the crowd. Definitely worth the wait. Ate so much I didn't leave room for a pizzokie. Probably one of the main reasons why I like this place.
Henry B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,7,11,,7/8/2011,5.0,Food is great and served in very large portions on big plates! My favorite is the shrimp scampi pasta with bread crumbs and lots of parmesan cheese! Also big choice of beer too! Very big facility with a huge parking lot.
Paul C.,San Gabriel  CA,4,40,,6/26/2011,4.0,I haven't visited a BJ's establishment for years  and this recent visit really surprised me. The food was actually very good. In particular  I ordered the reasonably priced California Chicken sandwich with a side of tomato bisque. The sandwich was much better than I expected; the chicken was flavorful  the avocado was heaped on  and the peppers added a nice tangy touch. Prior to that  I tried their Ahi Poke  which was again  much better than I expected of a chain restaurant. The tuna tasted fresh and the accompanying vegetables were crisp. The triangular fried cracker thingies coupled with the ahi/veggies and made it a textural delight.Now if only service was more prompt. When we walked into the restaurant in the late afternoon  the place was only a tenth full. You would think that the waiter would come right away. Instead  we waited over 10 minutes before our order was taken. And even then  it wasn't our waiter that took our order  but the manager  and probably because he saw we were in the weeds. THAT actually was a good sign.Then the waiter finally came along and proceeded to take our order only to find out that our orders were already taken.All that being said  the food more than made up for the lacking service. The price point was great for what you get. The environment is great for spending time with friends and watch the Dodgers lose in HD. I would come again  and probably not eat the pizooki.
Tiare A.,Los Angeles  CA,9,3,,5/23/2011,3.0,Besides having the waitress spill me water in front of our table  it is a very nice restaurant. Happening and busy on a Saturday night...but we still got a table within 15 minutes. Food was ok..I had the Blonde Shrimp. Very tasty although I wasn't impressed with the wedge fries (lack of flavor).
Bonnie O.,Rowland Heights  CA,180,3,2,1/29/2011,4.0,i ve been there 2 times  i like the Avocado egg roll so much.its really yummy.There is also very nice interior design.Feeling romantic.good dating space.^_^...But they really slow of service. Once I was waiting for my pizza almost 1 hur.its my problem?
Party_of_five _.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,41,,2/29/2012,1.0,Worst service ever. Waited 10 minutes just for someone to take my drink order and then another 10 for it to come and they still forgot something. Then the waitress completely forgot about us and waited on a bigger party..ridiculous. Walked out and was stopped by the manager who apologized and offered me a free meal. A little too late. Needless to say I'm never going back! Giving one star is being too kind.
Jacky L.,Rowland Heights  CA,0,9,,1/14/2013,4.0,I go here quite often  because of the close proximity to my workplace. This place generally has tasty foods  and is great to watch a game (if your a sports fan). The beer is good  and the food is decent as well. The appetizers can get pretty pricey  so don't bombard yourself  or you will not be able to enjoy your entree.
George T.,Santa Ana  CA,32,30,2,9/27/2012,1.0,Worst customer service of any restaurant ever.....online ordering is a waste of time. Order wasn't even sent to the kitchen...manager didn't even acknowledge a mistake was made or even said sorry. Guess she forgot how to talk to a real person. Maybe I should text my order to a server next time. They all like to use their phone anyways while working.
Jim S.,Moscow  ID,0,5,,11/4/2013,1.0,i love this place on any other day but monday! no sound on the game for monday night football....wtf!! just in the bar would be nice!!  out of here!
Maatje T.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,19,,10/13/2012,2.0,Service was excellent. Wide variety of food. (Check menu online.) It was LOUD. We asked for a table to the far side  where it was still loud. The noise was unbearable  so we left after the appetizer course.
Krystal L.,Diamond Bar  CA,24,14,,8/8/2012,5.0,really good food! love the pizzas and you HAVE to try a pizookie! it's a must! when you tell them it's your birthday you get a pizookie for free ;)
Deepa S.,Diamond Bar  CA,59,59,1,4/6/2012,5.0,I cant praise this BJ's enough. We went there for dinner with our family and received awesome food and I cannot the praise the service enough. Our daughter has a food allergy and the chef came out to speak to us about options and the process they used to cook her food to ensure there is no cross contamination. This is now going to be our regular hang out since no restaurant has ever done that for us. We usually get the eye roll   yeah right she's allergic to milk and think we're crazy or we're going to cause extra work. We never got that impression here. I am very impressed with the service at this BJs. The food was amazing as well. Thanks so much BJ's we really appreciate the extra attention you give people with food allergies.
M G.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,1,55,,7/20/2012,4.0,I got a chance to check this place out when they first opened courtesy of the boss. They were testing out their new waiters  so free lunch! I always drink their root beer  which is served ice cold and fantastic. Definitely get the chips and spinach dip while you're waiting for your main dish. The waiters are always friendly and make sure you're taken care of. Love them! It does get very busy at times  but a little wait is worth it.
Mark B.,La Habra  CA,0,3,,6/3/2012,1.0,I used to eat at BJs in Brea all the time and really liked it. I visited this new location today and was very unhappy. The pizza was cold and had very skimpy amount of toppings. The salad didnt seem fresh tomatoes were soggy and seemed old. I was very suprised wont go back.
James C.,La Puente  CA,132,29,,6/10/2011,4.0,Came here for the dallas and miami finals game 5. Great beer selection....good food.....decently priced...... SOLD!
Elijah Q.,Hacienda Heights  CA,53,185,14,1/19/2011,4.0,Been here 3 times and had no problems what so ever.One thing that stood out from the bj's in west co..is that noise level here is so much better i can actually here my table talk...not have to yell.Parking is a plus to...parking in front and back.Serive is ok not too good but not bad either.I also like the out door patio seating very nice.Stay away on a friday night all im saying.
JR M.,West Covina  CA,150,102,,12/15/2010,3.0,BJ's in Industry. I want to like you more but your first impression was very sub par. The waiter was very meh...welll...he was rude. He got nicer later in the dinner but maybe cause he noticed we weren't the happiest in regards to his service. He got one of the pazookie orders wring but at least he wiped that from the check. But other than that  this BJ's location was decent. Nothing too special about it. It's rather busy but it's still new. It seems to be smaller that expected but that doesn't really get in the way. Food is good but not stupendous. I'm not going to refer people here if they are craving any other than a pazookie  which are still great here. the pizzas are good too  those are usually what I order. The beers  which they prize kinda brag about are meh. They have the usual macrobrews which is expected  but their special brewhouse beers aren't really memorable. Definitely not up to Yardhouse or pub standards that I'm used to. I had the eight beer sampler and only two impressed me (Tatonka Stout and Piranha Pale Ale). The locale in an of itself is great. Brand new  flashy  great location on restaurant row and it's right by the theater. Definitely no complaints about where it is and the building itself. If the waiter was better (I know there's good waiters there lol) and if they had a better beer selection I would have given this place a better recommendation.
Heather V.,Fullerton  CA,17,6,4,5/8/2011,1.0,Until today  I thought BJs could do no wrong  after all they feed me my favorite dessert ever  the pizookie... BUT... Tonight I was given the wrong drink  they forgot to bring us our appetizer  our pizza took well over 30 minutes to come out  and the huge party next to us had this kid running around the table with balloons  the kid runs into a bus boy carrying a a tray of drinks and of course a drink falls to the ground. This would have been fine if the contents of that drink didn't come raining down all over where I was sitting. They promptly cleaned up the mess and apologized  the manager came and said he would comp our dessert we ordered  but we got the check and nothing was comped. At that point I was over it and just wanted to leave  so we paid and left without making a fuss. But that was the worst BJs experience ever. So not worth $50 to have your order repeatedly messed up  be spilled on  and then lied to by the restaurant manager...
Reina J.,Glendora  CA,57,42,97,11/9/2010,4.0,Im a fan of Bj's for sure! I tried the new one in puente/industry area. I'm actually sad to say I was a little disappointed. It was packed  we got a table in 10minutes. The fast seating was great. They sat us next to the kitchen and it was real busy. I don't mind that because I'm a people watcher and I could watch everyone moving around. I liked the waitress even though there was a lag on the food. She blamed it on the kitchen. One of my favorite things to eat there is the spinach artichoke dip  its the best ever!!! That took atleast thirty minutes to come out. It took so long the manager offered it to us for free. Which was kinda cool  that i didn't have to complain. It seemed as if the restaurant is still getting adjusted to the busy crowd. I was forgiving because its Bj's....all in all the pizza  dip and drinks were great. Its kinda a big location too... nice decor and friendly employees!
Rachael l.,San Dimas  CA,0,4,,3/21/2011,1.0,I went here a couple of nights ago with my boyfriend all i have to say is F this place... seriously. The manager needs to hire better servers especially not a douce bag...And the guy that serve was bald fyi if you get him.
Amy S.,Fullerton  CA,164,194,149,1/16/2011,4.0,waaaay better than the brea bjs. staff is better  more beers  and it's way nicer inside.
