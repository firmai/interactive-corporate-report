Hannah F.,"Andover, KS",0,5,,5.0,10/9/2015,"I had such an amazing experience. We had a waiter named tony who was funny and nice and took care of us very well. He knew when to not bug us but make sure we were doing alrighty. The food came out with great timing. Me and my friend shared a two for twenty steaks which mine was prepared medium rare and right on that, I had a side of some tortilla soup that was amazing. We had tthe Oreo desert that was crafted beautifully and amazing to the taste, and all in good taste of money. This whole experience was a blast, will be going back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Christopher P.,"Rose Hill, KS",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2017,"Our experience here at chili's tonight 10/14/2017 was AWFUL. Our waitress Madilyn was the worst server I have ever seen. Her service was not on par. Not only was she acting extremely unprofessional, but when my brothers girlfriend mentioned to our table ""our waitress sucks,"" Madilyn came back and gave us attitude. She was extremely rude, and we ended up having to talk to the manager, who kudos to him took care of our ticket and let us go. While we were talking to the manager in the front, Madilyn was blocking our exit as if we would try to leave without paying. I do not except the highest service from chili's, but something like this is unacceptable and she should be fired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Mr E.,"Wichita, KS",0,2,,2.0,10/7/2017,"Food was decent, very disappointed in the managements service and accessibility, known for being sports bar like with college games playing all over and when asked if KSTATE game could be put on(football team of Kansas) our waitress told us that the manager said it could not be put on because it started later while I was staring at the game on another tv across the restaurant... how despicable, I am thoroughly enraged and straight up irate by this.

Nicholas K.,"Wichita, KS",4,103,17,2.0,9/21/2015,"I know it is just Chili's, so i wasn't expecting to have my mind blown. We ordered the 2 meals for 20, so the price was reasonable. The side dishes were bordering on the good side, rice and beans, and the broccoli. But all the meat was pretty bad. I had the chicken and pork fajitas. Both meats were very bland, rally no flavoring at all. My wife had a steak. It was also bland and overcooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Diane L.,"Leander, TX",0,5,,2.0,11/23/2015,Awful service and food. I have ordered curbside pickup and the wait was terrible and then the food was terrible no dressing was included for the quesadillas! Won't be going there again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Donny S.,"Wichita, KS",4,10,4,1.0,4/21/2014,"Got a seat fast but then the waiting began. We waited a total of 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us. Poor, poor service. No one even asked as we walked out. Passing by the manager and the hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Glen S.,"Mulvane, KS",3,19,,3.0,9/19/2013,My wife and I had not been in a Chili's in years as we were tired of the poor service and even worse food. We went the other night with our two kids. The wait staff was excellent and when I commented to the waiter my steak though well cooked was tasteless no seasoning at all the manager came out and apologized and asked how they could improve.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal. Though we were impressed by the staff the food was average at best. Jamal is a great waiter !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
Val S.,"Wichita, KS",0,4,,1.0,12/5/2014,"Place on W. Central is really going downhill.  Ordered Mushroom swiss burgers to go, they informed us after we got there that they were out of mushrooms!  Then when I did get my Swiss burger, it was dry cold and horrible.  We've been a long time customer, sad to say we're not going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3

Gina R.,"Live Oak, TX",79,122,33,4.0,12/9/2010,"We rolled in in a slow night about 1 month after opening. It was very nice. One of the nicest Chili's I've been to. Service was excellent. The menu is basic. Nothing spectacular but everything came out hot, our server was attentive and friendly.Would defintely go back, maybe for Happy Hour, without the kids. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-3
