Truth be told, the other burgers they offer are just too big for me to finish, but the portion size of their Red Tavern Burger is just right.

It was the same as you get at any other red robin. Less lettuce than others which was good for me. The tortilla was super tough which means that it was probably microwaved. Made it difficult to chew through without all the innards of the wrap spooging out. :(. I asked for a side of caesar so I could dip my wrap if I wanted. When the food was delivered no side was included so I asked the waitress. She said she had the cooks put extra in my wrap.  ???  Why?  That's not what I asked for.  One of my companions got the chop burger.

The food was also outstanding.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich with cole slaw.  I love how you can substitute a salad or cole slaw instead of fries for no extra charge.  The fries are also unlimited - they bring you small portions (which is great); and if you want more just ask - they promptly bring you more fresh, hot fries.  The margarita's were good too - more than just a mix, they did pack a punch!

I'm never impressed with their burgers. I think it's their buns that I'm not a fan of; which in turn for me.. makes me not like the burger itself. Their buns feel like they are flaky and end up falling apart, so ya.. total turn off. If I have a burger; especially while dining at a sit down restaurant, I want my burger bun to be substantial and to be able to hold up and not fall apart like their buns do here. Came here recently and while the other people I dined with got burgers.. I got a cup of French Onion soup. Their French onion soup was decent and it had gooey, melted provolone on top! It had plenty of onions inside and a nice beefy, oniony broth.  As for service, we were greeted and seated right away, but I think the hostess was a bit clueless when it comes to the fine art of sitting diners. She basically ended up slamming our server with too many tables thus she was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. Our server did her best to handle the situation and given that she probably had one or two too many tables given to her, she stepped up to the plate. After we gave our orders I knew right away our server was slammed.. and we even overheard the manager telling the young hostess that she had given our server too many tables. I don't come here too often and when I do.. it's usually by someone else's suggestion. If you don't mind somewhat over-priced burgers and flaky, fall apart buns, you'll be fine.

The other more negative part of our experience was when two men sat next to our table and smoked thier very smelly e cigarettes.  I have asthma and just dont like to smell that while im trying to eat. The men were also being loud and rude to the staff. A bartender decided being rude and mocking the men back was the best idea. The bartender and men continued throwing verbal taunts and swearing towards each other. So everyone forced to watch this big show. The men never were made to leave and they remaind loud till we left. I will not be coming back to this location. The employees did not handle or de-escalate the situation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=140,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.18,2.8

Today - lets see where to begin.   First they had one gentlemen handling at least 5 tables that just sat down - we had 6 people at ours - too many tables for him - they need to get someone at the front who knows how to space customers out. We got our orders and asked for our soup to come first.     Finally I asked where our food is and he went and checked.   -  Everything came at once - the cold soup - the cold burgers - the cold mac and cheese, etc.    I am guessing he was not doing his job and checking and the soup had been sitting up there for some time - followed by the food. I had him replace the soups - but we were now getting concerned about the time - took too long - so ate the cold food.     Kids asked for refills on the Mac and Cheese and again waited and waited.   I finally went up to the counter and asked the first server I saw - should I get our food that is sitting there or can you bring it.   (Obviously she glared but brought it).    Our table had no attention paid to it - how is the food, etc.  No refills of drinks - anything we needed I had to flag down someone.  At the end I talked to the manager and he took care of the bill - letting us know his store is #1 in the area - really - hard to believe.

68,Inga D.,"Federal Way, WA",18,3,1.0,4.0,2014-10-26,"So, with this review I will add a photo.  Let me first start it off by saying that good service goes a LONG way. Very, long way.  We ordered an appetizer which was the fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks. They were pretty good. My spouse and son enjoyed their food and loved every bit of it. My son had mac and cheese and my spouse had the reds big tavern. I however was going to have a salad, but was won over when I saw the photo of the DGB burger. It sounded absolutely phenomenal. Fresh Arugula, garlic aioli and a nice angus beef patty. All on a ciabatta bun. Well... It was everything the photo showed besides the fact that it was completely raw in the middle. The outside however was VERY crunchy and burnt. I'm going to safely assume that it was made on a very high flame. Anyways, I tried to eat around the raw burger but couldn't do it. I ended up losing my appetite and hardly had any of my food at all. I ended up waiting for the waiter to come and take it away. I explained to him the situation, now here's where they got four stars. I know mistakes are made but when the manager himself comes by to apologize for the burger and explains how those patties are a lot more thicker than the regular burgers and are a little tricky to make. It was nice that he did that, but then he removed my burger from our bill, offered me something else on the house, which I didn't want because my appetite wasn't there anymore. So he proceeded to then to tell me that he will also take off 50% off the new bill. Which was our appetizer and my sons food and my hubby's food. Our bill was a total of 10$ I was shocked that they went out of their way to make me happy. It was nice that they admitted to their mistakes and did what they could to fix it. Not many places do this instead they just give you a small discount off your bill and send you on your way. And never apologize. I will be returning to this red Robbin, mostly because of the good service I was given. And if my burger was cooked fully I'm sure I would've loved it as much as the rest of my family loved their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=100,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.7039999999999997,2.68

My husband and I love their food and it's one of our first choices for dining out. However, this has to be my least favorite location. It's regularly crowded and sitting in the bar dining area has proven to receive slow service for the most part. The last time we came in I ordered a salad and half of the ingredients were missing. It's a salad I order regularly so I certainly noticed, but the server/manager actually argued with me on what comes on the salad (read your menu, dummy). Also the service has been really bad in the dining area lately too. The stars of this restaurant are Marsha (I think that's her name. Asian lady who has worked there a long time and very sweet) and the hostess Rae, she makes me smile the instant I walk in and talks to me like we are best friends. Love her.

Not only did she tend to us like we were the only ones there, but she had also other tables to tend to in her section and it was a very busy night! I came in to redeem my birthday burger and she was very helpful in explaining what I can and cannot order. Which is helpful because I hate getting my hopes up and have my eye on something super tasty (I mean everything at Red Robin is deliciously consistent) then having to change because it's not part of the ""deal"". I order the Prime Chophouse burger and a raspberry limeade which was amazing! My Boyfriend orders the Whisky River BBQ chicken wrap and it looked good and my boyfriend enjoyed it as well!  Anyway, back to Denise, at the end of our meal when she brings us the check, she asks if I would like a birthday sundae, singing optional. I opted for the sundae sans the singing. I'm 31 now and I don't want to make a huge spectacle of myself at a Red Robin. Denise, I want you to be my server again when I come back to your Red Robin!

We seated our self in the bar as the young male who greeted everyone ignored us, while chit chatting with two other female coworkers. So, without waiting I walked to the bar. Thank goodness for being old. Once there, no one greeted us or gave us menus, however, there was the bartender, two bussers, and two servers. I got up, walked to the host and asked for 2 menus. He asked why no one brought them to us. I bluntly stated ""You ignored us while readily talking and we have no idea who's covering our section"". We waited five minutes and still nothing. Then a gal came up and took our appetizer order and drinks and before I could finish ordering she ran off for another 5 minutes. Um... OK! I was so hungry and it was my birthday meal. I wasn't thrilled as this seems to be a continuous theme. I almost called over the manager. She mozied (spelling?) on back and asked if we were going to order anything else. I said I tried but she walked away. She said she was sorry busy running around. If you can't handle six tables, perhaps this isn't a good fit for a Friday evening in the bar as a server. Eh?  The great thing, which I will give her credit for and giving her a tip when she was losing points at the beginning. She did refill my husbands drink, which made me happy and brought him fries just in case. That gave her brownie points and made up for the long wait and walking away while I was in mid order.

As to the food... they don't seem to mind special orders and carry gluten free buns which are few and far between for most other burger joints. If you are a frequent diner here it's worth it to sign up for their royalty club where you get a free meal on your birthday, $20.00 on your 6th visit and every 10th burger is free!

I came in on 12/16 for dinner with three others.  It took too long for the waitress to take our orders but I didn't think anything of it at the time.  However, when she didn't bring or offer more fries, never refilled my soda, didn't bring napkins, and didn't clear plates the benefit of the doubt went out the window.  She gave us a sob story out of the blue when she came by to   cash us out.  We were in the middle of talking and then she came up to the table and started talking.  We stopped our conversation.  She was telling us how she was ok, things would work out, even though her life was hard.  What?  She then told us that she was trying to cope by being at work.  One of my friends, trying to show sympathy, said that sometimes work helps one deal with stress.  The waitress agreed.  There was this weird, awkward pause.  Then the waitress said she would cash us out.  Oh I get it!  She wanted a big tip for her bad service.   Red Robin has mini kiosks on the tables now that you have to use to pay.  The waitress showed my friend that graciously offered to pay the tab.  She hovered over her while she tipped her.  Not cool. My burger was fine.  Someone ordered a cup of soup - come on girl, don't pretend you don't eat.  My other friend got fish and chips and the other person ordered a burger.  No one complained but no one said it was good either.  Half of my fries were hard as a rock.  It would have been nice to get more fries.   When the server brought the food, she set all of the sauces on the edge of the table, away from where we were all sitting instead of taking two seconds to ask what sauce went to what person.  Don't be lazy, do your job.  It's not hard. The acoustics in this RR is bad.  We couldn't hear each other without speaking loudly due to the noise and large open space.  I've been here on a night when you can hear each other.  And no, none of us are losing our hearing.

Talk about a big tease :( lol. On our trip to WA, my boyfriend mentioned there was a RR near where his parents lived. Knowing this information, I was determined to make at least one stop there. I've only been to RR once, but that was a long time ago when I was a little girl. So I don't have any comparisons to other locations to include in my review but I can say it's better than Ruby Tuesday lol. We came to this location on a Saturday afternoon. We found parking easily and we got sat right away. Sweet. Since I couldn't remember my last experience at a RR, looking over their massive menu was a bit overwhelming! Luckily I was there with my boyfriend and his sister who knew the menu a lot better than me. They pointed out a couple of their favorite burgers and mentioned that RR was also known for their unlimited bottomless fries that came with unlimited dipping sauces (only the Classic dipping sauces were free). Um say whaaaaaat?  Our waitress was nice, but service was a bit slow on her end. When we were ready to order, she was nowhere to be found. After we got our food and she placed all our dipping sauces in the middle, she didn't bother to explain which was which. And when we wanted to order more bottomless fries and more dipping sauces, we had to flag her down to get her attention. But regardless of the service, we still enjoyed our food. We all ordered their gourmet burgers and even though the presentation of the burger looked nothing like their picture in the menu, the taste was still there. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ, and pretty much cleaned my plate. The bottomless fries were just alright.

As I child we loved coming here for birthdays, awesome food, the birthday song with the balloons and HUGE Sunday (always with whip cream and sprinkles and a cherry on top) I also remember standing on the chair and wearing a mask or something of the sort. Last night was probably one of the worst experiences at Red Robin I have ever had. We had a large party and John, our server seemed pretty new. First off the location was out of three different beers, Stella, Sierra Nevada and one other. This took us about 20 minutes to find out as we ordered one, then the other then the final. Which we were aware wasn't the fault of our server but when  the first beer of choice was gone he probably should have found out which beers were available on tap, not make the person ordering find out in the period of 20 minutes. Another person finally after 15 minutes went to the bar to pick up her drink she had ordered. Everything took a really long time. We finally ordered around 7, 30 minutes after arrival. Food arrived around 8, there were 10 meals ordered, 3 of which were for children. Multiple items were wrong, I received the completely wrong burger and my sister in-laws was supposed to be a turkey burger. She sent hers back and I just ate what was given to me. Hers came back about 15 minutes later (which we were surprised it was so quick). Fries were cold, my burger was lukewarm and one of our milkshakes ordered was the consistency of heavy cream. We were there for a little over two hours. We received our check then I asked our waiter if they would please sing to my son. A Sunday came about 10 minutes later that looked like it may have been prepared at 6:30 when we arrived, it was less thick than a milk shake. There was no candle, no whip cream or sprinkles.

Bill was our server and made this a 5 star experience, WAY to GO Bill! By far the best service I think we have had at a red robin even. From our initial greetings to our last farewell Bill was helpful, attentive, fast and pleasant. Ordered a sampler which we were informed a few minutes later that one of the items we requested wasn't available so we just more of Fried Zucchini . After demolishing out Mozzarella Sticks and Zucchini within minutes, Bill brought out the extra Zucchini that apparently we didn't get originally for our 3rd side. Recognizing that we wouldn't be able to eat our meals he offered to remove the 3rd side since it came out so late. Awesome! Of course, we stated that we would still pay for them if needed and he didn't want to have any part of that since we didn't eat them. A few minutes later, our meals arrived which were delicious. I had the same meal that I have had at a Red Robin for the last 10 years at least; Bacon Cheddar Burger - Well Done, Cut in half PLZ! Gf tried a new chicken burger which she liked.

The restaurant is dark, out dated and dirty. The floor has food all over it like it is halfway vacuumed maybe once a week. The food has literally come to our table with a hair in it. This last experience we walked out before even ordering due to the cleanliness of the restaurant. The table we we sat at was wet on one half from the dirty rag wipe down and food left on the other half from not being cleaned. My wife had to bounce back up after sitting down from sitting in water and I had to get napkins to wipe the salt and chunks of food from the seat on my side. Trying to push past all this at the beginning I then had to separate the sticky pages of the menu..... Ok, had enough of the review yet? Right? That's about the point I just decided to say, no thanks, we are leaving. I like Red Robin. Most establishments are pretty typical, this location clearly lacks the strong management that is needed to keep a restaurant clean and respectful. This place is surviving on the mall and freeway location. Sad. Updated this review (all written above) from a two star to a one star. Against my better judgment on my previous visit, my son wanted Red Robin and since it had been over a year since my last review I thought I might be able to play it safe and get out unscathed... WRONG. it was an utter failure that ended up not paying for one of the burgers and the app that was just deplorable. I'm done.

After a huge group of people left, some kid who kept running around and climbing on tables left his BBQ stained napkin on the floor. So fifteen minutes after they left, the minimum wage 16 year old still didn't pick up the floor. We had to use chairs to block our sight of the floor because it was just too disgusting. The person I went with had ordered an avocado croissant sandwich. Well it had no avocado, no mayo, no mustard, only ham, lettuce, and tomatoes. Turns out she got someone else's meal. The manager delivered the actual avocado sandwich, and while he was here she asked him how often they clean their floors. Prepare yourself. ONCE A MONTH! Disgusting. The only reason this place has two stars is because of our waitress that we weren't supposed to get, Denise. If the owner or manager or whoever is in charge is reading this, THIS WOMAN NEEDS TO RUN THIS PLACE. She was absolutely the best waiter I have ever had. She is so friendly and so kind. Took great care of us. Her alone gave this place that 2 star instead of 1. And with that, my review is done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=80,1.92,2.35,2.35,2.248,2.1780000000000004

This was the only visit that was this great. It was at a mellow time, so it was not as busy.  My waitress, Aubrey has to take the cake for this review. She was on top of everything. She was serving 3 tables at the time, but was on her toes the whole time. When our burgers came in, I'd let her know that we will finish our fries pretty fast, so she actually grabbed two fries trays right after she left.  She was on top of the drinks, questions, and everything. She got us a bigger size fry sauce when she saw us getting low on our sauces. Basically she was the top notch waitress. I couldnt ask for a better server.  Reason for a 4 and not a 5 is because the Red Robin always smells like dirty rag.

Our waiter was very busy, but very attentive, and communicated when there was a hold up on our order (like with our beers). He was super gracious to my mom, who is not very tech savvy, and their tablet payment system. The food came out delicious and 100% as represented on the menu. The only thing knocking this down from four stars is that the bathroom definitely needs some updating, and had a stale bathroom smell. The other is that they had run out of the coloring menus for the kids, which meant we had to otherwise occupy our kids. No big deal, all told, but everything else was well executed.

Staff was condescending, rude, and just didn't care at all... my family had to wait 45 minutes to even receive water or drink service. It took another 15 minutes to get the drinks after ordering it. Also It took over an hour to get their food. To top it off my husband saw the manager being extremely rude by talking to group of young Asian people like they are dumb. My husband couldn't stand the way the manager was being extremely rude and talking down at them.  When it was time to go, as my husband was not happy with their service so he didn't provide much of a tip...especially because he waited almost TWO HOURS to eat, from the time he stepped into the restaurant. The waiter made a rude remark about the tip, so my husband told him about the horrible service he had received, the manager (same one being rude to the Asian customers) came over and started talking to my husband condescendingly and did not even offer to make things right. If you're a manager, you should not be talking to ANY customers like they are stupid or dumb, and secondly don't talk condescendingly to customers!!  If you can avoid this location, AVOID, go to another location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20,2.72,2.34,2.34,1.968,2.492

We ordered a burger, a salad and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold and dripping in grease, the burger was good, and they brought us a BBQ burger instead of a salad. When the salad was replaced the salad wasn't cold and the toast that came with the salad was stale and cold. It seemed that all food items had been sitting for a very long time before they were delivered. Our waiter was friendly, however seemed annoyed when we sent back the burger for the salad that we ordered. The bathrooms were filthy and several stalls did not have toilet paper or toilet cover.

I particularly didn't like that the manager just didn't take care of it, but felt the need to try and pass off the half filled cup as a full one when half of it was filled with whipped cream. It felt disrespected as a customer, by the manager.

I'm not sure maybe she wasn't in the mood or it's her first serving job but our experience didn't make us hate the place, however ! I probably won't be taking my family out to a Red Robin for a long time . We've barely gone as is .  I Myself , not our waitress , felt the need to move most of our dirty dishes to the next table  for our desert .  I shared their new salmon burger with my cousin and it was dry and somewhat cold . The kids shakes and juice didn't  get to them until after everyone's dinner was out and we asked . Which would have been fine if the wait for our dinner wasn't close to 40 minutes .  It was funny that the waitress asked if we wanted a refill on our fries but we never actually got a basket . I wish she brought us more napkins in between dinner and deserts or napkins with our dessert would have been nice  As for desert we tried the brownie sticks and croissant donuts and to be honest both were not that great .  The young lady in red and black plaid , might have been a supervisor or manager was very nice when she helped drop off dinner . Made me feel like I was going to enjoy the sandwhich lol .  I left the minimal 20% . Would have left her more if she actually was more attentive and if the food was good .

Keep in mind that we've (our church youth) been going here at least once a month for the past 5 Years.  Last Sunday, we came in, our waiter (don't remember his name) didn't refill our fries a single time, only brought out 4 baskets, even though at least 10 people ordered items with bottomless fries, didn't even bring any sauces, came only once after to bring out our food, and when we asked for more fries, sauces, and refills for our bottomless fries, he nodded and never came back until he brought our receipts about an hour later (which he didn't even put in the system so we could pay and just leave).  Usually, we get about $50 in tips for our whole table for just an hour, but I can most definitely guarantee that it was a lot less than that this time.

I hadn't been to any Red Robin for 5+ years when they started jilting people on the not-so-bottomless fries.

As I was lining up to request a table, a man cut in front of me and the waitress helped him first. She then proceeded to take down my info with a frown and the way she talked was just monotone and unprofessional. After about 15 minutes we get sat between two crowded tables. The seating situation here is tight. They crammed all the tables as close together as possible to get the most tables in as possible. It's honestly a fire hazard. The two seater tables are so cramped you can barely fit anything on it.  After waiting about 20 minutes with no water and no waitress to help us I had to track one down to come to our table. She apologizes and proceeds to take our order anyways. After 15 minutes our waitress Kass finally decides to greet us and bring out some water.  Usually they bring out the fries first but this doesn't happen until she sees that we're a bit aggravated. The garlic fries are worth upgrading to,because the regular fries are a bit bland. Once the food comes out Kass brings out another lemonade, but fails to take the empty cup off our small table.  I then witness someone clean the tables super speedy but not very clean, even leaving behind a knife on the chair and a tie on the floor. I tried to tell him but he was in too much of a hurry because they're clearly understaff. Our food comes out and my Siracha mayo sandwich wasn't very good. My boyfriend orders one of their ""gourmet"" burgers which was just decent. Slightly better than Wendy's.  During the whole experience it was extremely hard to track down our waitress Kass.

Tonight we ordered 2 burger meals, a kids chicken strip platter, and an appetizer of Onion Rings. I also ordered a smoothie and a kids milkshake. Total, about $60.  Of course we didn't expect hot sizzling food, as it is about 10 minutes from Restaurant to home. However, I was told the smoothie and milkshake machine was down, so we would be refunded for that. Okay, things break, I get it. Anyways, I open the bags of hopeful goodness, and must say... It was not on par with what we get when we dine in. The chicken burger I ordered was good, but I think their fry machine must have been broken? They were overcooked, and I counted maybe 5 fries that would have been acceptable. It almost looked like we had some leftover fries thrown in our boxes. All 3 meals had what looked like a bankrupt burger joint portion of fries.  The onion rings are supposed to come with a dipping sauce, which didn't happen. And of course the food was cold, but we anticipated that while ordering for delivery. That's why microwaves and ovens are an essential part of our home.  Needless to say, our overall meals were not worth $60. I mean, for $60 I would at least expect some form of an attempt to deliver 2 quality adult meals, and 1 quality child's meal.  Sooooo... If you plan to have Red Robin delivered, don't expect 1/2 of what you would get dining in. I would suggest saving that $60, and cooking at home instead.
