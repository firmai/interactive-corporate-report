Alexis M.,"Lemoore, CA",0,23,2,5.0,7/13/2017,"Definitely love this location. Wasn't a huge fan of chilis until I started going to this one, the servers are very attentive, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Manny M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/7/2017,Worst service in Hanford. Sadly  Hostess on his phone .. server ignoring us ... It takes them 20 minutes to realize they haven't taken  our order... smh never again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Mark L.,"Visalia, CA",9,113,59,4.0,5/15/2017,The Hanford Chili's is great for lunch. I usually get there before noon to avoid the crowd. Even when I show up at the noon lunch hour the restaurant can handle the flow of people.  The lunch menu has a decent amount of choices. The food is good and shows up in a timely manner. You can definitely eat here on a lunch hour.  This restaurant is in a mall parking lot so plenty of parking. The parking lot next to the restaurant has kind of crazy shape. Can't believe someone was paid to design it.  The staff is always helpful and my ice tea never ran empty. Good choice for a lunch time meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Julie L.,"Visalia, CA",101,10,3,1.0,9/19/2017,"Poor Service in the bar. Ordered bottomless soup/salad for lunch. Waitress brought both at same time, never refilled my water cup, never asked if I wanted refills on soup or salad. The only time she returned is to give me my receipt. I was the only female at the bar amongst men. The men were catered to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Rocio M.,"Reedley, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Food was below average. Service was horrible, our waitress Amanda was horrible we had to ask for silverware and napkins on several occasion before they were brought out to us. It wasn't even a busy night and everyone seemed so rushed and like they could care less. Definitely will not be coming here again thanks to subpar service even from a chain restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Spoon Z.,"Hanford, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/14/2017,"I have been to this place about 5x or so and each time was not pleasant. Unfortunately it was the the wait staff. At one visit the bus boy was actually taking care of us because we were being neglected lol. Every Time I went it was not my idea, but rather what the majority decided. Last time I was there we ended up leaving after about 15 mins of sitting there without anyone coming to get drink orders, and this was in the bar on down time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Jay M.,"Galt, CA",19,62,,5.0,11/2/2017,"Went there tonight for dinner. We were greeted at the door, seated right away. Our server came right away and got our drinks. Took our order, food came out cook to order and hot. She checked back with us several times, very friendly. The ribs fell off the bone, very tender, will definitely order them again. Had their chips and salsa, one of my favs. Overall a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Matt M.,"Fresno, CA",42,436,48,1.0,11/21/2016,Went here to celebrate the old bday and sat down at the bar area and waited for 10 minutes and no one bothered to help us. As we were getting up to leave the server comes up and blows us off when she sees we're not staying.  Its not like they were very busy either. Maybe they should have spent the money they wasted on the remodel on some training or hiring a decent staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Dominique S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,12,11,2.0,7/28/2017,"Went to Chili's for a family dinner and I was not impressed. I was actually disappointed. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out and half of my party didn't receive there food for another 10 minutes. I ordered a simple meal, loaded potato soup and a house salad. Soup came out room temperature, and the salad looked like someone threw it on the floor and pick it back up and put it on the plate. Hopefully they were just having an off day and that the service isn't like that all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Jon C.,"Glen Ellen, CA",0,131,,1.0,4/22/2017,"A couple of months ago, I had a late Sunday lunch with a friend.  When we arrived (about 1:45), the restaurant was about 75% full, there was one family in the waiting area and no one else in line.  There were at least 10 empty tables, about half were clean and ready.  The hostess was having a personal conversation with a guest, obviously a friend.  We waited almost 10 minutes (no exaggeration) for the hostess to even acknowledge us and finally - as politely as we could - interrupted their conversation to ask if we could add our name to the wait list.   The hostess sniffed at us, added our name and went right back to her personal conversation.   Another hostess came out and checked the waiting list.  She then helped buss more tables before coming back to seat us.  Once seated, our waitress was fairly attentive.  It took almost 15 minutes for our order to arrive.  Our meals were OK, but the portions were on the small side and the taste was nothing to rave over. Now, I understand that the staff was coming off the Sunday brunch rush, but the lack of professionalism displayed by the hostess staff really ruined our visit.  I'm not a Chili's fan and this visit reinforced why.  My friend, who lives in the area, said she would never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford

They have awesome service, delicious food and a relaxing atmosphere..

Demetrius O.,"Salinas, CA",210,4,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"Where do I start? The server was good. That was about it. The place was empty, yet we waited over an hour for the food. 3 adults, 1 child. We ordered 3 salads and a macaroni and cheese. It seriously took over an hour to get that order. When we did, the lettuce was soggy on both mine and my wife's, my chicken was cold; like the salads had been sitting around for a while. We did not eat them and were not charged for them. I was charged for the other 2 meals. So basically I waited an hour to pay to spend another half hour watching 2 other people eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford

Elda L.,"Hanford, CA",11,13,6,4.0,8/28/2016,"I like this place. I'm a pescaterian so I usually order the fish tacos which are amazing. But today I tried the shrimp tacos, and they were very good. I usually swap out the flour tortillas for corn but today I forgot. Flour were still good but they do taste better with corn. Had very good service as well and my water cup was always filled... I like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Deziree T.,"Silverdale, WA",0,16,6,2.0,3/23/2016,"The experience I had today was just...awful. My sister and I went here for lunch today. We ordered the Triple Dipper appetizer, with the cheese curds, onion rings, and the fried pickles. The only decent part of that appetizer was the onion rings. The cheese curds were so salty. The fried pickles were practically inedible. The brine from the pickles was already salty, and it was covered in a salty batter. We could not eat those. We received a platter of chips and salsa. The chips were decent, but the salsa tasted like tomatoes straight from a can. No flavor. Our entrees took a while to get to us. Turns out, the server forgot to input our entree order into the system. When we did get it, it was ok. We both ordered the quesadilla lunch combo. While the quesadillas were ok, they desperately needed a dip. We didn't receive one for our meals. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars was because our server was so kind and helpful. Even though she made a mistake, she was still so nice and polite. She was working so hard already. Otherwise, I don't see myself returning to this place. The experience was extremely disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford

Alei C.,"Hanford, CA",2,57,9,5.0,3/5/2016,"I don't understand the bad reviews, I have always had a great experience here. The service is definitely 5 stars- the waiters and waitresses are always nice and on top of drinks and whatnot.  The food is also 5 star. Last time, I got a steak and it was melt-in-your mouth. The 2 people eat for $20 isn't a bad deal either.  Also, the little trivia games they have at the table are always so much fun for date night.  I am definitely starting to become a regular here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Elisa P.,"Bonner, MT",1,11,9,1.0,2/24/2016,"I don't even know where to start with this place ugh. When my family and I first started coming here it was great I would say in the last 8 months it's went downhill.  Last time we were there we had the most forgetful server in the world. Drinks took 15 minutes to get out. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with our chips and salsa. 20 minutes later we finally get the chance to ask again about it. He obviously forgot. Ok so we're waiting and waiting.... Finally 45 minutes later the manager comes out to apologize that the pasta is taking awhile to cook and that is the delay in our food (I'm not dumb I know the server forgot to ring it in). We asked her if we can at least have our salads we ordered. She brought those our promptly. 10 minutes later we finally ask the host to have them just to put our food Togo cause it was getting late. No problem. We get home, daughters hungry. Go to get her food it's not there. Looked at the receipt and our very forgetful server never even rang her food up. This was the third time in a row getting horrible service so why did I go back today? Well the manager left me some coupons so I thought I would just do Togo order. Not much better.  Got online to place my Togo order. Did all my modifications for the burgers asked for salads etc.....  My email stated it would be ready at 12:04. Cool that was easy. Get there at 1205. There was a lady ahead of me that had already been waiting. Shortly after my arrival a gentleman comes in and waits. Long story short we were all there an additional 25 minutes. Finally get the food when I realized they game me fries instead of salads so once again had to wait for the salads.  Get home and what a disappointment. My Togo box was all melted obviously been under the heat lamps for awhile. I asked for extra mayo for my husbands burger.... Had none! My burger was so cold and the bun was hard (from being under the heat lamps for so long) that I had to get a different bun from home and put the whole thing in the microwave. I asked for no onions... What did they do pilled them high. There were no homemade pickled like they promote and to top it off..... My bacon was not even on my burger it was off to the side. They obviously forgot to even put it on there. Oooooo let me tell you the gentleman that was also waiting for his Togo was MAD!  You probably wonder why I don't call and say something, what good would it do. I have had to talk to management over the last 2 visits did no good plus I don't want them to think I'm just complaining. Trust me I normally don't say anything unless it's really bad and I always give credit where it is due.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford

Spaulding A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,54,,3.0,7/3/2016,"Well, it's Chili's, right? I hadn't eaten in one in about a thousand years, and I needed a place to (1) have lunch and (2) watch Italia play in Euro 2016. 5 stars for big TVs all around the bar! Yay suburbia! I guess the service must be hit and miss, because all the servers at the bar on a Saturday afternoon were polite and attentive. So, not sure what happened to others with reviews here. It's Chili's, right? You don't really need a sommelier to assist you, or a coat check, or... Anyway, the man and woman behind the bar floated by just enough to ask if I wanted something else but were not pesky as places can be when you try to watch a game.  The chicken with beans and rice I had was fine; the chicken in particular had been marinated in lime or brined, or both, and was cooked just right. The rice and beans were... ok. I had a salad that was iceberg lettuce with some flavorless (not very good cotijo maybe?) cheese and a mediocre dressing.  So, in closing, this is an outpost of a casual chain restaurant, and I was glad to find it this weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford
Yuki I.,"Lemoore, CA",6,13,28,1.0,9/6/2014,"Came here with the husband expecting a decent dinner and it just went downhill.  First of all, ordered a martini and waited 30 min for our waiter to tell us he forgot to ring-up the drink. Another 45 min later food arrived. I ordered the $20 dinner for 2 6oz classic sirloin in medium rare. When it arrived, steak was very dry and over cook. The sides to it were brocolli which was also very dry and corn on the cob was cold. Worst place to eat, but what do you expect? Its Chili's!! Bad food, bad waiter/waitress.

Not only is service super slow, the waiters will refuse to look at you when they know it's taking forever. The last time we were waiting over an hour just to receive an appetizer and never once asked if we wanted any refills. When we finally flagged down another waitress because our waiter refused to look in our direction, she told us she'd get right on it. And she did.

Ryan R.,"Hanford, CA",7,7,3,1.0,1/31/2014,"My family and I made sure to call head because we had 7 adults and 3 kids under the age of 2.  When calling they said it would only be 15mins for our party. So, we took off right away and all where under 10mins.  After waiting for an addition 5mins they came and told us it would 30mins before our table would be ready. Upset now that we where lied to, we decided to stay and not load the three kids back in their car seats.  We kept checking in, to see if our table was getting close and we where told it is getting close. Now it is 1 hour since I made the reservation and kids are loosing it and need to eat at this point. We ask for the manager and her response is it will be 5 to 10mins longer.   At this point we don't care and just want food.

Kathy P.,"Kingsburg, CA",23,37,43,2.0,2/16/2012,"I love Chilis!  However, this one didn't impress.  We waited close to an hour to get any food at all during the lunch hour.  Our meal came before our soups and salads?  Very odd.  I also would have expected the waiter to acknowledge that it was taking awhile and apologize...but even when questioned about where our salads/soups were...no explanation....only that they were coming.   We were on a generous lunch hour and still ended up being twenty minutes late to the class we were attending. I would have felt better had they acknowledged the problem instead of giving us the cold shoulder. I tried a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and it was just ok, kinda bland.  My fries were cold.  I loved the Chicken Tortilla Soup.

Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,2.0,5/20/2013,"This is obviously not Chili's flagship restaurant.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were quickly brought over to a booth and the hostess put the menus down and immediately walked away.  The booth was very dirty though  - trash all over the floor under the table, crumbs all over both the tabletop and the seats -- so much so that neither of us wanted to sit down.  Since the hostess had long abandonned us, we tried to move to the empty booth directly behind us...except that booth was worse so we went back to our original booth.  Several employees walked by or were within seeing distance but no one even acknowledged the issue let alone came over to help as I cleaned off the table and seats with one of the napkins on the table.    My boyfriend ordered queso dip and chips for us to start with our drinks - he had a beer and I got a margarita.  The drink menu lists lots of different margaritas but doesn't list any prices so I should have known better or at least should have been smart enough to ask because I wound up paying $10 for a meh margarita made from a crappy mix.  Oh well.  The queso dip and chips were pretty good but the chips are weirdly thin.   For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered a burger and I tried the chicken crispers.  He was happy with his burger, and I thought the chicken crispers were ok but rather greasy.  That said, I knew I was coming to Chili's so that was really the kind of food I expected.  The service (starting with the dirty table) was seriously lacking.  Our waitress was nice but a little weird on the verge of annoying and would disappear for long periods of time so what was meant to be a quick dinner for 2 took over 2 hours.  When we finished our entrees, our server took them away and then came back with an unsolicited check, but we had wanted to order dessert.  My boyfriend was worried that ordering a dessert to-go would prolong our stay by another 30 mins but I foolishly sad ""no way! just order it.""  Unfortunately, he was very accurate.  In sum, our visit was long, dirty, and disappointing...there's a simile joke in there somewhere I just couldn't think of it but feel free to come up with your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=40

Misty A.,"Fresno, CA",22,9,1,1.0,3/23/2014,"This restaurant (if I can even call it that) does not deserve ANY stars but I have to put one to put up this review. I have never had a good visit here.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!! I have had nothing but problems at this Hanford location.  I went tonight with my boyfriend for my birthday and the waitress we had included help from another waiter. We ordered an appetizer to share and a meal to share as well. When we received our meal my boyfriend was trying to tell her that our fries were not the ones we ordered and she interrupted him and said that she was sorry she just threw them on there and that our Texas fries were in the window and she was going to get them right now. FIVE minutes later she comes back saying that they will get us fresh fries the ones they were going to give us looked like crap. Before she left my boyfriend could get 2 words out to ask for a plate she left! She walked by us one more time and my boyfriend tried to call her again to get a plate and she just ignored us, he got up and kept saying ""excuse me"" and then the bartender noticed that he wasn't getting thru to her asked if he needed anything so he asked the bartender for a plate.  The waitress came back and my boyfriend took her aside and let her know nicely that she had interrupted him multiple times and let her know that he understands that she's working and we're not the only customers in her area she was VERY Passive-Aggressive towards him and then some customers approached her and asked for their change she was very nice to them and gave them their change and said and i quote ""I'm sorry, apparently I've been interrupting"" to them. We told her to take the burger back and to give us our check. She was still rude to us and gave us our check for the appetizer we got. We paid with chili's gift money[$20 but our check was only $11.48] that we received from our last time having chili's because of a previous time we had horrible service and our order was wrong.  I have never ever been treated the way we have tonight and cannot believe that people like that are working in the food service industry when they clearly cannot! THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US MULTIPLE TIMES I'M SURE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES!!  I will tell everyone in Hanford about my experience and let them know that there has not been 1 time out of the many that I have been there where it has been good. **My BF spoke to the manager in Visalia [Scott] and he was very helpful listened to everything that he had to say [w/o interrupting] and said that he is going straight to the district manager...So THANK YOU SCOTT IN VISALIA**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=40

Stphxx ..,"Hanford, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Walked into the restaurant after just watching a movie from the Hanford mall around 10pm. As my friends and I walked into restaurant to celebrate a birthday, the waiter walked right by us and walked to the back, we didn't think much of it and waited and extra 8 minutes just so he can come back and say 'I'll be with you in a second', and came back after 10 minutes. So basically almost a total of 20 minutes just to get seated (Btw the restaurant was not busy at this time). The waiter then grabs the menus and seated us right next to the door, and my friend (birthday girl) kindly asked if we can be seated in a booth, he then replies and says 'no sit here' and walked away. We did not hesitate to walk up an leave to Applebee's instead, in which we immediately got seated with a friendly employee, and got a very energetic and nice waiter to start us with drinks.

On the table was some kinda iPad?  U got me. The server never bothered to tell us abt it. After messing with it I found u could order and pay ur bill. Wow what a concept. Except I'm sure some one is now out of work due to the self serve format.  So we ordered. I got the Smokehouse Big Mouth Bacon Burger and my wife got some Mexican enchilada dish. Which she loved by the way.  The burger was very good. However where the hell was the bacon!? Dam they used to put two big ass slabs of bacon on this thing. That's the whole reason for ordering it.  Yea there was some bacon. But paper thin and not what it used to be.  Never the less. I have to say it was tasty and I did enjoy it. It was nice and messy the way it's supposed to be. I see these lame assed reviews abt how a burger was soggy and all that BS. Hey dumbass. A juicy burger is gonna be messy and the bun might get soggy.  Would love to give Chilis 4 or 5 stars.

The waiter took our drink orders about 5 minutes after our party had been seated. Appetizer orders were taken another 5 minutes after that, but those came out pretty quickly so the service hadn't been too terribly bad at that point. However, after what seemed like 20 minutes of waiting (everybody had been ready to order for quite a while) we finally had to bring attention to another waiter that we weren't being serviced. We had to wait another 20 minutes before the food finally arrived and by that point a lot of it had gone cold. Out of the twelve people in our group, three of them had to send their meals back because they were incorrect. The food wasn't terrible, but my friend's fajitas were disgustingly greasy and he didn't enjoy them at all. My caesar salad was covered in about a pound of dressing and I couldn't taste anything else. Overall, I'd have to rate the experience a 2/5.

This area of the city is newly developed, complete with a Super Wal-Mart, Target and fast food galore.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a weekend lunch. There were a few parties in the main room and only one other table in the bar. Even though they had plenty of tables, we had to wait for them to set one up w/ a high chair for 7.5 of us. So we ended up in the bar (a baby in a bar? that's so Sweet Home Alabama) and squeezed into a booth in the back. Despite all the empty tables around us. We put in our order and waited a loooong time. So long that a table that arrived AFTER us received their food before us. Luckily, the baby boy kept us busy. When the food finally came out, I almost wished it hadn't come out at all. Maybe it was because I've been trying to eat healthy lately. But everything was way oversalted. My corn was drenched in butter. The ribs were dry and rubbery.

When I entered the restaurant, I almost changed my mind.  The servers were singing ""Happy Birthday"" to someone surrounded by 8 family members or friends.  As I sat down, I was having a major pity party.  Although I had already opened up my presents, I had brought my cards with me that I had received in the mail.  I had done so because I thought that it would seem as if I was having a virtual party with my family members. (Little lame, I know.  But you do what you gotta do!) The place was very busy, but I had a nice waitress.  After things calmed down, she came over and talked to me since she had noticed my cards.  I explained that I had just started a job that day as a superintendent of  a school district, that my husband was out of the country on business, and that I was celebrating my birthday by eating out and opening my cards.  We talked a few more minutes and I continued eating my salad (which was very good, BTW.) As I was finishing my meal and waiting for Betty to bring my check, Trucker (one of the managers) came up and welcomed me to the community.  He congratulated me on my birthday and said that I would have to come back to really celebrate my birthday when my husband got back from his business trip  After chatting for a few minutes, he left and I waited for the check. Suddenly, others came up and began singing ""happy birthday,"" bringing me one of those sinful molten lava cakes.  Betty handed me a card and one of the African American servers teased me that he was bringing me extra chocolate as he pointed to his skin.  After they left, I opened the card and discovered that they had given me gift certificates to come back and celebrate my birthday with my husband at a later date. While I enjoyed my meal, it was the thoughtfulness of the staff that I will remember as I think about them reaching out to a stranger celebrating her birthday alone in a strange town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80

Max M.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,1,1.0,7/13/2012,"I have eaten in a number of Chili's and this one is struggling!  The service is spotty, the food is okay  not good.  When I voiced a concern over the fact that I had waited 50 minutes for a hamburger....the manager said ""Oh""  that is it.  The waitress only filled our drinks one time- remember that it is over 100 outside!!!  I have tried Chili's three times in the last 2 months and not had a good experience one time.  I am cured -I will take my hard earned dollars to a place that wants to remember that they are a service industry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80
RP P.,"Sarasota, FL",6,62,2,3.0,1/28/2011,"Apparently this is where all of Hanford goes on Friday night. Don't complain if you have wait for a table - consider yourself warned (or if your table is too small- they are standard size; you are probably too fat and should walk home and have salad instead). The food is average quality, the portions large, and cheap. The margaritas are dangerously drinkable, the gin and tonics are more like gin with a twist of tonic. My fries were soggy, which shouldn't be the case when the kitchen is clearly flat out. The service was courteous and prompt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80
Jaclyn M.,"Porterville, CA",7,2,,2.0,6/8/2013,"So yesterday I went to Chili's at 7 O'clock to meet my sister for Dinner and I wish I would have gone somewhere different. Yes we went on a Friday night so obviously there would be a wait so not a problem, thought I would go and sit at the bar and eat there rather then wait for the dining room side however there were 3- 6 tops and 2- 4 tops that were GROSS, food was not bussed from the tables or wiped down the bar top where the alcohol was siting was dirty and the floor was gross. I asked the hostess if I could sit in the bar section and she said it was first come first serve however they expected the Customers to sit at unbussed tables filled with drink and food from previous customers. DISGUSTING and a health violation also! I asked if she could have one of the 6 tops that didn't have food on them wiped down before I sat there and she said NO!?? seriously so after that I decided to just wait for a table in the dining room section. It was about a 10-15 min wait not bad. Arrived to our table and it was clean however our menus had food on them...(it takes a couple seconds to wipe them down) our waiter he was ok got our drink order fast and then was tentative with coming back to check on us to see if we were ready to order, got our order in and then for being as busy as it was it came out pretty quick. But HOWEVER once our food got delivered to the table he was not very attentive other waiters brought us items he forgot. My sister ordered the Taco Pizza and I had the new Guacamole Burger with a wheat bun and black bean burger with sweet potato parm fries to sub for reg fries. the food came out and although my dish didn't look the best it had an explosive flavor that I was not expecting it to have except they forgot the parm.  With my sister Taco Pizza she had no complaints. Overall, wasn't happy with the staff and how they handled the bar area. The place was dirty but the food made it all worth it. Thankfully.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80

BV W.,"Henderson, NV",36,191,16,1.0,9/23/2009,"I decided after coming here that I was not a Chili's fan. I've been there 3 times, to various ones, including this one. Each time was fail.  Don't order off their healthy menu. I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich, which sounded like it might be yummy, but it was tiny and tasted like biting into a huge cube of salt. Yeah, gross huh. The buffalo sauce was the worst I've ever had, like salt water. I guess when they cut calories they jack up the sodium for taste, it was horrible.  The service was great, but I just really can't stand the food. The waiter told us they were out of chips too and gave us some old ones, on the house, but still, old chips? Yum? Then the tortillas we had here for the fajitas were cold. Who doesn't have chips and serves cold tortillas?! Enough said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80

Steve B.,"Corcoran, CA",0,19,14,3.0,8/16/2009,"Let's start by saying we come for the lava cake. Kids menu items are ok.  Got the $20 apetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert deal. Grilled shrimp Alfredo was fine. Noodles were cooked properly. Hard to believe how many restaurants can't properly cook noodles. My wife said her quesadilla explosion was bland. Floor was filthy at the table they sat us at. Our first waitress was good. Kept up on drinks and chips. She introduced her replacement and then we didn't see her again for about 15 minutes. Did I mention we come here for the lava cake?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80
Jocelyn F.,"Castro Valley, CA",73,246,18,1.0,8/22/2008,"My Aunt moved my baby cousin to her hometown and now to see her I have to go to Hanford. Okay - I am up for a roadtrip. Me, Cousin, Aunt and Mom headed to Chili's for lunch. Hands down the worst Chili's in the nation. Okay - maybe not the nation, but the worst one I have ever been to. The place was practically empty, we are escorted to a booth and we waited. Like we seriously wait. Eventually Destiny come over to take our drink order, I order an el nino and mom has some mango thing. When the drinks are brought out, my marg has salt on the rim, she didn't ask and I forgot to mention it. Since half the blame is mine, I try to overlook it, I take my fist sip and get a mouthful of salt. I am confused and ready to send it back, my mom offers to take it and have me order another one, as I am passing my glass to my mom, my aunt notices that at the bottom of the glass there is a mount of undisolved salt. I look and damn - she's right. I don't know who taught the bartender that salt should be applied to more than just the rim. I send the drink back and I guess as punishment the bartender ups the juice and downs the alcohol level. Like Kat Williams says - fuck you. Since we hadn't got our food yet, I wasn't allowed to send it back (mom and aunt have rules). The food was ehh. Mind you - I have been eating at Chili's for like ever. The enchilada soup was off, my chicken fried steak was mushy at the bottom. I don't know who they have in the back jacking up the food, but they need to get with it.  The point of a franchise/chain is consistency. I have NEVER had a bartender fuck up an el nino. The service was off -we would ask for stuff and not get it - plates, etc. All in all the place left us bleh. Next time we go to Sonic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=80
