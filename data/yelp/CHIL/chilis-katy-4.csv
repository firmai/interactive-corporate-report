Steve D.,"Katy, TX",13,96,54,5.0,8/17/2017,"We love this location at Mason RD and I10. In particular we love Bobbi the bartender. When we come in to dine we request Bobbi as our server. She always makes our dining experience more enjoyable. Today I had the new chicken and mini waffle dish. It was very good as usual.  My wife had her favorite backyard burger with bacon. She said it was perfect. From keeping our teas full, to providing plenty of napkins, Bobbi always does a great job. She is the main reason we like this location over the rest, including the one that is closer to our home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Ginger G.,"Rosenberg, TX",20,77,54,1.0,1/10/2018,Worst service ever. First it was cold outside and the AC was blasting on our table so we asked to be moved. After being seated and about 10 minutes passed our waiter came and took our drink order. I told him we were ready to order as well.  Food came and one order was wrong so he had to take it back and fix it. My Water was not refilled at all during our time there and the service in general was very slow and lacking. We asked him to split the check and he asked how so we said 50/50-down the middle. He brought the check back with an uneven amount and then a check for my 8 year old daughter so three checks that weren't even split 50/50. We asked him to fix it and again explained 50/50 for the check. It took several minutes and he brought back two checks and they still weren't split 50/50. We did not take time to try again. We paid and left.  Would not come to this location again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Sandy C.,"Houston, TX",23,29,10,1.0,8/15/2017,"This is the dirties and disgusting Chili's.  We ordered two soups, they both were  Sour in taste. Both had cheese that had gone bad. The Nacho's were stale. And the Manager did nothing about it!! The waiter brought us new soups and said, I found these nachos in the back somewhere. My daughter and I looked at each other and were like gross  and. Soups were still sour and chips from the back somewhere?!! Gross!!

Bora C.,"Katy, TX",122,75,93,2.0,11/24/2017,"The hostess and the kitchen staff who brought out our food was great, but the waiter lol wow, I don't know what his problem is but he has no etiquette, and left us sitting there where the hostess had to take our orders, and the kitchen staff had to get us refills, extra sauce, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Martha P.,"Humble, TX",119,25,17,4.0,12/9/2017,I always enjoy eating at chilis. Their food is really good and the sweet tea is always on point.

Long N.,"Houston, TX",70,118,41,1.0,4/13/2017,"I came on a Wednesday night. The go-to place for me is the bar any time I go to a Chili's. I was planning on a late dinner and a libation or two. I am always content with a semi-clean bar and an attentive bar tender. This place had neither... The entire bar top was sticky. Not just my section, the entire bar top =/ The hostess started spraying some sort of ""polishing"" spray to make it better; this made it worse. The gentleman next to me had napkins assembled on the bar top so he can rest his arms because it was so sticky; that was funny. The stickiness of bar tops do not usually bother me because I understand it can get busy but, this was extremely sticky! When the gentleman next to me signed his credit card receipt, he had to peel it off of the bar top and we both laughed. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to get to me with a total of 3 people at the bar; not entirely his fault because it looked like he had to take care of the tabletops in the bar area as well, but there were only 2 tables... Once he got to me he was a nice person and had a good attitude. I ordered a drink; it took awhile for the drink as well. After this, I decided I was not going to dine here tonight. I drank my libation, asked to close my tab, waited 5 minutes for my bill, waited another 10 minutes to pay with my card, waited 5 more minutes to get my card back, signed my receipt, and got out of there. I will not be coming back here. Chili's on Fry rd. is a better option if you're hankering for some ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Taylor F.,"Fulshear, TX",103,34,24,1.0,8/1/2017,"I always want to like chilis because they're everywhere and they seem like they want to do well but they just never can cut it.  Service at the bar was friendly but a little slow- he was swamped at the service well. Definitely a staffing problem and not the bartenders fault. People waiting for a table were also trying to get drinks so it was a little hectic but the bartender kept a kind demeanor- even with some rude customers at the end of the bar. Food was not good. My order had to be sent back 3 times and by then the veggie burger was smashed to pieces, the fries were cold and requested avocado was missing. The bartender asked a server to fetch it from the kitchen and he brought out my 3 slices of avocado *on a dirty plate* all the while reminding the bartender he needed to ring it up (which he already had). There needs to be a proper expo to make sure this food is going out correct and on time. Prebusing was also non-existent. Closing people's tabs out when their dirty dishes are in front of them is a no no. Even at Chili's. My fiancé waited on my food to come out to start eating so his was cold too by the time we got tired of trying to get what I asked for.  No apology from management- no attempts to make it right. I don't expect freebies but if you mess up more than once at least drop by and say sorry.  To add insult to injury we ordered two rounds of beer during happy hour only to not have the second round rung up on time - considering the non-happy hour price was only $.89 more we were more upset about the fact that the happy hour price was basically a lie.  No paper towels in the restroom, sticky floor, water all over the counters, trash on the floor, and the straight open view to the kitchen- servers handling Tortilla chips with their bare hands. Cooks with no gloves handling dishes and wiping their hands on a rag instead of washing them in a sink. Needless to say- not coming back.... even for $.89 off at happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Ebony W.,"Austin, TX",72,6,5,1.0,9/9/2017,"Went to chili's in Katy for the first time after living here for a year. My advice... Do yourself a favor and stay home. Their service is terrible. We stood at the to-go counter for 20 minutes. After about 10 waiters walked past us someone finally decided to come and tell us that the counter was closed. We then proceeded to the bar and the staff there ignores us there as well. Needless to say, we left chili's and drive to Raising Canes and got better service at a fast food restaurant. I see why chili's is going out of business. I haven't been there in a year. Maybe I'll try again next year if they're still opperational.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Jeff W.,"Katy, TX",0,43,24,3.0,9/22/2017,Not bad as far a chilis goes. The new smaller menu appears to be in use now and the burger seemed a little tastier than usual.  The staff is usually nice and friendly with the food is good for a fast causal place.  My complaint would be why there is not Miller Lite draft available it is kind of popular.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Ivonne M.,"Houston, TX",28,3,2,5.0,9/19/2017,We love Chilli's at Mason. Our server Tony is always a joy. The service is quick and the food is amazing.

Tessa J.,"Round Rock, TX",0,7,7,1.0,5/25/2017,"My sister ordered the beef enchilada plate and didn't eat it. It was disgusting. She told the manger  (Sandy) and she replies, ""Well, you ate the whole plate"". This is exactly how the plate looked when she showed it to her. She was very unconcerned, and sarcastic!!!  On another note, my niece ordered the shrimp Alfredo pasta. Although my niece did eat most of hers, she had six shrimp left and she bit into one and it was completely raw. The only difference is that it was covered in Alfredo sauce. So, lied to my niece's face and said she only had two shrimp left.  They had already taken the plate, so she forgot to take a picture. Sandy had the nerve to give her a $2 credit for being given raw shrimp. It's like she thought we were trying to get free food. Well  the food was awful on one plate; and the other plate had food on it that was raw (which was shown to her). How much proof do that idiots need? We'll never go there again! I'd rather eat my fingernails.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Alex M.,"Humble, TX",45,76,52,1.0,10/18/2017,"I've stopped in here before, but this is the first time I remember to check in. Unfortunately what reminded me to check in wasn't a pleasant reminder. A few people I went with got there prior to me and I went ahead and asked them to order for me. I specifically told them what I wanted to eat for lunch. And what I wanted as my beverage. I had them order me a sweet peach tea. As soon as I get to the table and take a sip of my drink. To my surprise it was unsweetened. I asked my colleagues if it was a joke and they said no, we got unsweetened tea as well even tho we asked for sweet. I got there and did not see the waitress for the longest time. When I did end up seeing her it was because she was bringing out the food. Once again. When my food was brought out the order was wrong. Well my friend did mention that she ordered it correctly, but they brought it out incorrectly. So I told the waitress and she looks at my friend with a dumb founded look and was like ugh fine I'll get the fried pickles. Well since i was on a time frame for work I started eating. The rest of the experience does not get any better. I did not see the waitress until I had already finished my meal. The fried pickles did not come out until I was done with the rest of my meal ( by this time I was full) and we never got napkins and refills until the end. I would completely understand if it was busy, but the waitress only had 3 tables tops and spent most of her time in the back. If this could change I might reconsider my review but as of now this is my experience. Not sure if I will be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4

Mia Z.,"Katy Mills, Katy, TX",37,2,,1.0,8/16/2017,"This Chili's location allows smoking at the bar.   There is no sign to advertise that smoking is allowed. We walked out because I could smell the smoke and after waiting for about 2-3 minutes for someone to come seat the parties in front of us, I saw the stream of smoke coming from the bar. In addition to the smoking, there were at least 3 parties waiting at the door when we got there. No one was at the guest desk, and they were still waiting for someone to come to the front when we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
Patrick M.,"Houston, TX",66,34,164,1.0,5/19/2017,They must think their beer drinking customers are retarded. Every time I order a Hopadillo they give me a different beer. The bartender literally gave me a Lawnmower (non IPA) and called it a Hopadillo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4
James J.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",29,27,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"It's chilis so of course the food is ok, not great but it's ok. Normally we go for the decent restaurant and the decent bar. But the mason road store still allows smoking, which really sucks these days and the bartender was horrible. When I have to ask for a second drink you are terrible. When I have to wave and whistle you are straight up a shitty bartender.

Eric Y.,"Houston, TX",68,177,35,5.0,8/12/2016,"The worst thing about this visit was the extremely disruptive kids sitting behind us. I don't get parents who let their kids run all over the place and disturb other diners. As far as the dining experience goes, once we moved to a different table we had a great dinner.

Brandon B.,"Katy, TX",120,43,2,1.0,12/28/2016,"First off the manager Brandon, was very nice and courteous and refunded me my money. He's ok in my book. But this place sucks, I stopped going here over a year ago because of so many issues. So Today we decided maybe we will give it another shot... Well it was a Togo order, they cooked the wings wrong not once but twice while I sat there waiting, and my other foods are getting cold. On my salad I ordered avocado ranch, and we ordered 2 big tubs of extra avocado ranch for all the other food..... Guess what we got normal ranch, and some southwestern ranch on my salad. The guy in front of me at the counter, they forgot his ranch all together, and he came back in again while I was waiting because they didn't give him any plasticware. The only reason I asked for my money back is because I will never eat there again, and I drove there got wrong stuff and now have to drive back to get my money back. I have no clue why people eat here, the food doesn't even taste good, just look at all the other negative reviews, it's just ridiculous how this place is still even in business.  I'd like to add after reading other reviews that I also noticed how dirty the place was, and people are saying they have seen roaches crawling between tables on the floor in the middle of the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=20
Keith K.,"Katy, TX",63,17,7,1.0,7/14/2017,"Normally i enjoy my visits to Chili's but last nights experience was not pleasant at all. Our server was very polite and did his job wonderfully but who ever was in the kitchen did not!!!!!!! I order the app trio ( with burger bites, cheese bites, and original Chicken crispers) the chicken was under cooked to the point the breading on the inside was wet and the chicken was rubbery and slightly pink I ate my other food and waited for my server then showed him the problem he apologized and offered to bring me another app or redo this app i said that fine i love the chicken normally so he took my plate with the chicken pieces i had cut in half and the breading falling off and raw and returned just 3 minutes later with the same plate i kid you not the cook put that chicken back in the fryer.... this time it was overcooked and hard as a rock and ummmmm gross who does that. so when asked if that was better i said no its worse he offered again i politely declined and said i was done. He offered a discount on my meal which i didn't ask for and it was appreciated! so again my server was not the problem the cook was. Not to mention the floors were disgusting and in general the restaurant was not as clean as i am used to! You can not serve raw chicken then throw it back in the grease to recook and serve on the same plate it violates so many health code violations its crazy... Sorry to say I will not be back..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=20
Lauren E.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/30/2016,"What a horrible experience. Went there & it was awful. First of all, it was so dirty- dirty dishes everywhere. Someone ""bussed"" our table so we could sit there. The table was greasy, not to mention the cushions of the booth had grease and crumbs stuck to them. So the server comes & takes our drink orders & I never saw her again. She was really busy but no excuse... ask for help. So I ordered pasta with no chicken, it came with chicken and the pasta was disgustingly cold and had no flavor. Couldn't even find anyone to refill my drink. So the restaurant was soooo dirty, horrible service, and food that tasted a week old. I'm not returning that's for sure.

Niya R.,"Houston, TX",444,93,263,2.0,2/24/2016,"Ok so, I do not like Chili's and the only time I go is when that's the only option or they have a good deal going. Needless to say, I dined for National Margarita Day. I promise not to give a biased review.  BY FAR, the absolute WORST location I've ever been too. Service was super slow, if it wasn't for the kiosks they provide the table with we would be looking around the restaurant for the server, which we were anyway. We sat in the bar so I expected it to be pretty busy. It actually wasn't. The server had about 6 tables....all of which had been sitting a while. We saw the manager very frequently in the area, but there was a table that sat for about 15 minutes before they were taken care of.  Service is way too slow and we asked the server for a few condiments which took a while. The server who delivered our food almost spilled my water on me and didn't even apologize - literally came to the table sat down the nachos and some dirty saucers and walked off. We weren't provided silverware, luckily we were sitting next to the dish station and was able to grab some that were by the way, dirty as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=20
Ricardo G.,"Chinatown, Houston, TX",0,16,,1.0,5/5/2017,"This places smells like cigarette smoke.

My nephew, a special needs boy, had a seizure at the table and threw up afterwards.  When we notified the manager, she came back with a bucket and towel and informed US to clean it up. Totally caught off guard by the rudest customer service I have EVER experienced, I went back to the manager and said a mop was needed. She then informed me they don't have mops. After I told her how appalled I was that she was making us clean it up ourselves, she informed me that they didn't get paid enough to do that, but would see if someone could clean it. The manager returned to the table apologizing and offered to give us a free dessert.  Are you serious!!!!!  A free dessert!!!!

First of all, the ""Cajun"" pasta wasn't even Cajun at all! Menu said chicken was seasoned with Cajun seasonings, but the chicken tasted like it was just put on the grill with no seasonings, and then popped onto a plate of pasta and cheese. No flavor at all! And for the fajitas, they barely give you any condiments to dress your fajitas, just a small plate with about 2 tablespoons each of guac, cheese, diced tomatoes and sour cream. The chicken for this was also pretty bland and dry.

We've eaten at Chili's before (always this location) but this time was pretty bad. Our waiter (Ryder) had NO personality and wasn't very attentive...did the bare minimum amount of work & checking on us. He wasn't very nice or personable but maybe he's just one of those people with no personality so whatever to that. The food, on the other hand, is not a whatever situation & it wasn't good! We ordered the skillet queso which was sort of chunky/mealy like it was reheated from the day before or something. Then, when I got my meal, my fries tasted sort of stale and day-old which was a bummer because I love the fries there usually! The only good thing about the entire experience was the watermelon cooler I drank but there are yummy drinks lots of places so that doesn't even make up for the mediocre service & bad food.  I've noticed Chili's really going downhill the last few ones I've gone.

Problem number one with any establishment is having frozen food. The place is dirty and makes me feel kinda icky... Service is craptacular.

Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,2.0,5/21/2011,"Ah Chili's, where you can eat two days worth of calories in one meal!  How efficient! Sarcasm aside, after joining weight watchers almost a year ago, this was one place I realized I could no longer go after looking at their nutritional info.  Even their ""guiltless grill"" items are a bit on the high side.  What brought me back here was a recent craving I have been having for fried batter, ahem, I mean chicken.  Since Chili is a favorite of my hubby, I decided I could get something battered and crunchy here and he could indulge in his love of appetizers. What I noticed upon walking in was that nothing has really changed.  The floors and tables are disgusting.  A lime rind here, some guacamole there, a smashed french fry, a crayon, and giant crumbs on chairs and booth seats that the staff always seem to forget to clean off.  Typical Chili's.  And then I realized it wasn't just the food that drove me away from Chili's, but more like the fact that it is pasted onto the floors, booths and the menu's.  I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say I hate touching their menu's because there is ALWAYS something encrusted on it, but invisible to the naked eye until you've touched it - then I get that whole ""eww"" feeling like I need to wash my hands! As expected my husband ordered his southwest eggrolls, chicken tenders and loaded potatoes.  I got the crispy chicken tenders but subbed a salad for the corn.   I literally asked my husband if he ordered loaded potato bites or if it was made with some sort of dark bread.  That's because they were about the color of Outback's bread and didn't look like potatoes at all!  My salad was good, which shocked me since it was Chil's.  The only problem is that they dice the tomatoes and cucumber up so small, it is difficult to get on your fork unless you use a piece of lettuce as a spoon.  The chicken tenders were fine, except for the gristle, which even fast food restaurants don't have a problem removing. I will say this place definitely gave me a sense of nostalgia.  There was apparently a graduation in our area tonight and the place was filling with soon to be high school graduates dressed in their finest suits and dresses having dinner.  I told my husband, ""remember when we were younger and we thought Chili's was a 'nice' meal"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=40

Kimberly H.,"Katy, TX",0,7,,1.0,12/31/2015,"So, this location has been our go to for years. We never had any huge issues until lately. The wait started getting longer (with multiple open tables visible), the food started taking longer, and one visit we actually got our food at different times... like 15 mins apart. When mine got there my corn was still frozen!!! I could go on and on with the food mess ups. But, the last time we went was the last straw. We waited for about 15 mins before we were even greeted by the hostess and given a beeper for our place in line. After that, we sat for about 20 more minutes looking at all the empty dirty tables... the hostess would leave the bar (talking with coworkers) to clean one table every once in a while, but she was in NO hurry. While we were waiting, not one.. but TWO separate guests came up to the hostess to ask for the manager (Keep in mind she is chit-chatting at the bar, so they have to wait around for her to finally notice them). When he finally came out, he pretty much told the upset customers that they were short staffed and there was nothing he could do about it. As the 3rd customer walked up, I asked if they were requesting the manager. When they said yes, we got our stuff and walked out the door.

To top it all off, after waiting 20 minutes for our food, we were told that the loaded potato soup fell on the floor and they were out of it. So they would have to thaw a new batch from freezer to make some for us. The manager tried to salvage the situation, but the overall experience was just awful.

Tina R.,"Houston, TX",120,121,58,4.0,9/17/2008,"Ike. In 1953 he became the 34th President of the U.S. of A. If you're a history buff or lived during that era, when you think of Ike you're likely to think of the Space Race, World War II, 5-star General, NATO, Korean War and of course the highway system. The interstate highway system we know today is completely different from what Ike had in mind back in the 1950's. His main purpose for launching the construction of highway systems were for military purposes. The Cold War was going on during the time and it was believed that if large U.S. cities fell under attack, the people would be able to evacuate and the military would be able to move in quicker. However, in my opinion it gave way to the rise of suburbia. Americans could now live in the nice white picket fence suburbs and the commute to the city to work became a whole lot easier.  Fast forward 55 years later and we're using the Interstate Highway system completely differently than what Dwight envisioned. It is still used as a means for suburbanites to commute but it has also become a means to evacuate from hurricanes.  I'm pretty lucky. Nothing was damaged. I didn't lose my home. My only problem: I still don't have power. No power means: no hot showers, inability to warm food (in my case... inability to make coffee), no refridgeration and you can't charge your phone.  Luckily, I have family in other parts of Houston that did get their power back. On Monday. So I'm staying there for now. Before they got their power though, I had heard that there was gas and power in Katy. So I went. I live near Spring and I traveled to Katy hoping to find gas and an open grocery store. All the stores out on the north side were either closed or had long lines to get in. All the gas stations were either closed or had long lines. I hardly ever go to Katy. The only times I've been to Katy is for Katy Mills (sucks by the way) and traveling through to get to Austin (before I discovered that 290 will get you there quicker).  It was absolutely desolate on the north side of town. Driving at night was just plain weird. There were no lights lighting up the streets. No traffic lights. I thought for sure one of those creatures from I Am Legend would come out from nowhere.  But out here in Katy on Monday after the storm... there were people! Stores had power! There was gas! And Chili's was open!  Normally, Chili's is the LAST place I want to go. I know a couple of days is nothing without hot food and cold drinks compared to some folks who STILL haven't had a hot meal but it was nice to be able to eat something else OTHER than peanut butter sandwiches, crackers, and room temp water. I had chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob. My daughter had the mac and cheese kids meal. She loved it. The chicken fried steak was okay, I've had better but under the circumstances it tasted delicious. And I was just happy that my daughter was eating. She got really tired of peanut butter sandwiches and crackers REALLY quick. The food came out really fast. They were probably anticipating the entire city of Houston in Katy so they staffed up in the kitchen and no shortage on waitstaff. If I needed another diet coke or anything, someone was RIGHT there to give me whatever I needed.

Kim K.,"Katy, TX",38,102,,4.0,7/26/2009,"I'm one of the few people in my circle of friends that really really like Chili's.  I don't know why, but I get all excited when I am going to head out to Chili's for a dinner. This weekend was the first time that I went to Chli's in Katy.  It was Saturday night, about 6.30pm...and the wait was only 10-15 minutes.  Wonderful!  We sat down and waited and got buzzed pretty quickly for our table.  I was with the fiance, so it was just a party of 2.  They sat us down at a really small booth, a booth made for 2 people.  Which is fine with me.  But unfortunately, the center stand for the booth was large...too large for a small booth.  So the only way I could sit was to spread open my legs! LOL!!!  Good thing I was wearing jeans and not a skirt.... We ordered from the ""2 for $20"" meal...1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, all for $20.  Love the deal.  Although it's not the entire that was available for the deal, it was still a decent selection.   I had the strawberry lemonade because that is my favorite drink.  However, I could taste something weird about the lemonade.  It was clearly a fountain lemonade, which is fine, but there was just some...taste to it.  I still drank it though..and got a refill. For appetizers, the fiance and I shared the queso.  Yummy!!! I loved how it had the ground beef in it.  I needed to stop myself at a point to save room for the actual entree and then dessert!!!  The appetizer came in pretty quickly.  For entree, the fiance had the ranch bacon quesadilla, while I had the mesquite chicken salad.  My chicken salad was pretty good...it was a green salad topped with grilled chicken, pico, crispies, corn, and a little barbeque sauce, served with ranch dressing.  I enjoyed it a lot and finished the whole thing.  The fiance's entree came out wrong at first.  It was just regular quesadillas, which had onions in it (which he does not like).  So, we just got the waitress to take it back and bring the correct order.  They were prompt about it and started the order again immediately.  We got it soon after.  The dish was okay...honestly, it was just a regular quesadilla, with some bacon in it, and some ranch to dip it in.   For dessert, I'm not a big chocolate fan.  But the fiance is.  So, we instead of getting that Chocolate Molten lava cake, we instead got the chocolate chip version.  Instead of the chocolate cake base, it's actually a yellow cake with chocolate chip.  The rest is the same....chocolate inside, with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, covered with chocolate layer.  Let me just say....we devoured it in no time!  Cleanliness...I am dissapointed to say that I noticed our table had some fresh chocolate stain that was probably from the previous couple's dessert that they did not clean.  I was about to get them to clean it off, but my dinner plate came and covered up the stain....But, I have to remember, this is Chili's, not a 5 star restaurant.  Can't expect everything to be perfect! Service...it was great!  Our waitress was really nice and attentive, so we left her a pretty good tip :)  Hey, it can be hard to get a good tip when the total bill is not even $30 hahaha.  Because she was really nice, we wanted to reward her :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=60
Denise C.,"Houston, TX",0,9,,2.0,3/5/2012,"We usually order take-out from this restaurant, however, it had been a crazy day so we decided to actually go in this evening and just relax.  We started to regret it almost immediately.  We were in a section where the only other patrons were an 8-top top table.  It wasn't surprising that they received ALL of our waiter's attention. However, it took 20 minutes for my soup to arrive, and it was the wrong kind and wrong size. The waitress that brought it was snippy when I pointed it out, she asked if I could just eat the one she brought.  After declining, she was yet even snippier and finally took it back.  When I did get the correct soup it was room temperature.  After about 10 more minutes I managed to flag down our waiter and express my disappointment with waiting such a long time for a cold bowl of soup.  He then insisted he had ""just ladeled into the bowl"" and had become busy with the larger table's order and ""thought someone else had taken care of us"".  After I declined the second bowl and told him I would just wait for our entrees, he immediately took it away and then slammed it down on a dirty table behind us.  At this point, I was becoming really irritated with the increasingly bad service and had pretty much lost my appetite, so I sought out a manager and asked that she replace our waiter with somone else.  She was very accomodating and comped my meal and had a very nice waitress replace him.  In my opinion, the damage was already done.  It's hard to justify service like that on a Monday evening when the restaurant was only half full. I wonder how bad it gets when they are really busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=60
