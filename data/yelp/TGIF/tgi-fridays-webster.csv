Amanda C.,"League City, TX",73,1,,1.0,4/30/2016,My son and I ate here today and the boneless chicken was under cooked and got my son and I sick!!!! Will not eat here again not worth the stomach issues.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Mary T.,"Friendswood, TX",10,2,,1.0,1/19/2016,Service was ok but the food was was too overpriced for the amount that we got. It was like wal mart refrigerated food that was served to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Paul G.,"League City, TX",0,12,,3.0,4/10/2016,"Visited on a Saturday evening. Not very busy at all due to nearby road construction near the mall.  Had the Endless Apps deal, which is a good value, but were slow to receive the first couple rounds of appetizers.  Service was pleasant and attentive, but when I couldn't finish the last app I was told I couldn't have a box to bring it home -- apparently it's not allowed with Endless Apps because too many people order a bunch of apps and just take them home. I get it there are some gluttons out there, but for people who obviously aren't trying to scam the system there's no harm in giving people a take-home box! Very frustrating.  Apparently Endless Apps is going away soon so it's a moot point, but assuming it comes back next time I'll probably go to a different location where they're willing to ""bend the rules.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Dawn G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,11,1,1.0,9/20/2016,"We went in on Friday Sept 16th evening around 8:30pm. We had a large group with us, however the tables weren't all that packed. Not as busy as the manager claimed. Told us it would be a 2 hr wait if we all wanted to sit together or he could seat us separately asap. Then proceeded to tell my husband that the tables are very close to each other so a couple of our friends from our party may not fit... REALLY!!!!! Then after sitting all of us around at separate tables throughout the restaurant, got a major attitude when we found out there were 4 empty tables near some of the rest of our party and asked if we could move closer to them. My major issues with this location are: 1. Management SUCKS!!!! Have some understanding and be considerate to your customers, after all they are giving you your paycheck!!! 2. Servers: be more attentive to your tables, we waited 20 minutes then had to get up looking for you just to get our check.  3. Seating: don't sit the tables so close to each other that a customer is snaking another with hair or arms just to move.  We will NOT return to this location!!! Recommendation, if you are a big person, don't go to this location. The manager is horribly inconsiderate",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Stephanie C.,"Deer Park, TX",1,22,18,1.0,9/10/2016,"My one star is because my apps were cooked perfectly. Not burnt or old tasting. I have been going to Friday's every other weekend recently but this location is crap. I walked in and the host just stared at me so I said table for 2 please. Still not a word then he showed us to our table and told us a waiter would be right with us. I was hoping for endless apps but was told by the waiter that endless apps ended a few days prior so that was sad. The entire time I was almost gagging on the smell of cigarette smoke I had no clue the restaurant allowed this, I find it crazy! The moment the waiter approached he did not say hi. He placed napkins down and quietly said ""I'm...(couldn't hear name) I'll be your server, what would u like to drink"" I honestly had to lean in towards him because I could not hear a word he was saying. He didn't once smile and just flat out looked like he did not want to be serving us. Once I ordered he brought the food put it down and walked away without saying a word. The entire time I ate he did not come to the table. Once I was done with my plate he came by took that and again did not say a word or make any eye contact. About 5 minutes later he brought the check dropped it off and didn't say a word just kept walking past the table. I paid he walked by picked up the check book and quietly said ""thanks"" as he kept walking. Never saw him again. I don't believe this guy is cut out for waiting tables, he might be better suited for a library. Needless to say I will NEVER return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Debbie M.,"Houston, TX",5,119,18,2.0,8/25/2015,Ordered the famous pecan crusted chicken salad. The chicken was dry. The chicken tasted like it was cooked yesterday then heated in a microwave. Such a shame these Friday's are nowadays. I remember the Fridays of the 80's: YUM. The ones now are subpar. Great server today. It's not his fault the kitchen is lazy. (The rest of the salad was good)!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Demetria C.,"Texas City, TX",29,142,670,3.0,3/13/2015,"2$16 Spinach Dip/Ribs dip was good and creamy and ribs were tender. First dip arrived with someone's hair yuck, they replaced it no problem , ordered the strawberry mule taste like a mule hoof was in it, returned replaced with long island ice tea was no better too strong and not sweet enough , our host Jay really tried to make amends but I guess I should have stayed home and ate TV Dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Marla M.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2015,Came in on a Friday after work for a burger and wine. Paid for my meal and left. The next day get a call from my bank someone at the bay area location tried to run my credit card for $357.  Thank God the charge was denied but the hassle of it all and the nerve of someone trying to steal money that's not theirs. Will never eat at this location ever again. Beware if you go here at night your info can be compromised.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Daja P.,"Houston, TX",94,6,,5.0,9/19/2015,Ashley was our server in the bar area. She was very attentive and polite. We got our food quick and it was delicious! money and we scored on Hapy Hour. Yes!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Jennifer H.,"Webster, TX",19,22,9,3.0,11/12/2015,The food here is very good and the drinks are great.  The wait staff is always very attentive and friendly.  My only complaint is the noise level.  Not a good place to go if you want to hear anything your dinner companions are saying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
Jason C.,"Houston, TX",127,36,32,3.0,12/24/2011,"Friendly bar staff and decent food.  On this trip I had the Jack Daniels burger w/ fries.  The burger was good, but I wasn't too into the JD gimmick.  It didn't really make anything stand out to be anything different than what I've eaten before. Their Stripes program seems to be pretty nice ... I got my burger for free 'cuz of it (Thanks TGI!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20
K R.,"Webster, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/26/2013,"Wow Was seated around 6pm.  After waiting 20 mins, still no waiter had came by.  Looked around to see that only 4 other tables were taken.  Not liked it was crowded or anything.  Stood up to get attention from staff.  Made eye contact to a 1 waitress that RAN by and 1 waiter that had a beard and looked like a hobo.   Decided to keep waiting. If this was the last place to eat at the end of the world I would eat my own arm first.  I have seen better service at the DMV.  Id rather get my food and eat at the line at the DMV. Avoid at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster?start=20

Dani W.,"Houston, TX",33,19,18,1.0,6/3/2012,Dear TGI Fridays off Bay Area Webster... Your food was alright although your waiter doesn't believe in deodorant and was the smell hit our faces.

Monica H.,"Friendswood, TX",0,7,,5.0,8/19/2017,"I go here frequently with my girlfriends for drinks. Their 4 dollar house LIT can't be beat.  I will say they used to be WAAAYYYYY more lenient in their bar. For example,  the bartenders would tell me to name something and they can make it for 4 dollars, so i always ordered Captain and Diet with lime...that drink is now more pricey and they do not let u stray from the drink specials they have listed for the day so that's a bummer.  If you don't have your ID, you ain't drinking so have it ready...even if you're elderly they don't let it slide. I love that you can still smoke the bar. I usually sit at a booth surrounding the bar but u can smoke there too.  I went with my fiancee last night for the ribs they're  advertising and was not disappointed.  I got the sweet Tennessee mesquite and they were amaaazzziiinnnggggg. I always love their food and the service is always good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster
Troy K.,"Kemah, TX",335,352,1113,4.0,1/8/2018,"Ok I'll give Fridays credit for so many options. I'm talking gluten free, vegetarian, ect and no freaking up charge. Beyond meat burger, amazing gluten free bun are both awesome. The drink specials are amazing in the bar. Yeah it's mass produced food but it's way better than Chili's or applebee's, or any big chain. The options are huge and the portions are as well. This location has a great friendly staff as well. Open till 1 am too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster
John D.,"La Marque, TX",59,177,290,2.0,3/25/2017,"The two stars are in regards to the fish and chips, which I tried out of curiosity. It was a mistake I regret. The fish was too hot and had a bit of an iron flavor, the cole slaw was too dry, and the fries were bland at best though it's a bit of my fault for not using ketchup. If there was a saving grace to my dinner, that would be the green bean fries. Dip those bad boys in the cucumber wasabi dip provided. Your taste buds will love you for it. I'll still come back to this TGI, but will avoid the fish and chips like the plague.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster
Shermika H.,"Houston, TX",431,220,1201,3.0,7/13/2017,Tonight I ordered the jack Daniel ribs and sides online. Which was very fast and convenient.

Chris S.,"Missouri City, TX",0,1,,2.0,10/18/2017,"This use to be a place and get a drink, but it has went down hill.  The two stars are for being greeted by the host.  I figured I would get better service in bar I was wrong.  I sat at a booth, and it took one of bartenders like 5 mins to come over, and he was courteous.  I ordered my long island, mind you most around me had boxes and ordered took him 5-10 mins to come back but is was after the female bartender asked me about my drink.  I was going to order food but I was afraid that it would take longer than me waiting for my drink.  When I got my drink it was more sweet and sour than anything else.  This place use to be a place I would come on a regular basis.  I am glad I came to find out how much it has gone down hill.  It will be a while before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-webster

Tiki B.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",70,93,102,5.0,7/26/2017,"Saw the ribs commercial on tv this past weekend , so I figured I'll give it a try today. I ordered the Jack Daniels Baby Back Ribs, loaded potatoes and a salad. Placed the order online, and went to pick it up at the time my automated email said it would be ready and to my surprise it was getting packed up upon my arrival, which I greatly appreciate.  The greeter(s) were very courteous.  Ok, now back to the food, it was affordable (special going on), my ribs were tender and very tasty, seasoned well and the sauce was just right, they don't drown your ribs in sauce but they do put a lil on them, which is a plus just in case you don't like the sauce, but I like the sauce. The loaded potatoes are good too, I don't think you can go wrong on potatoes. Overall my service was excellent.  Sorry no pics this time, I was starving.

haley a.,"China Spring, TX",0,22,1,2.0,9/13/2017,"Wouldn't recommend bringing your children here since there is smoking allowed in the bar- there isn't a door to close off the area so smoke can be smelt from even the furthest part away. Service a little on the slow side but that may have been our location requested to be away from the bar. Food was decent and happy hour was advertised all day on a couple of days which is awesome but unfortunately won't be back since we have kiddos.

Xochitl G.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,43,10,1.0,2/26/2017,They sit you down tables that are filthy ... I placed my app order got my beer and still no one bothered to clean up the SEVERAL tables that were dirty... me and my family were literally siting in the middle of this mess.  After waiting and waiting and just staring at all those dirty tables I lost my appetite and just canceled my order as I wondered how dirty is their kitchen... nope sorry I pass. As I refuse to eat while I'm surrounded by filth. There was another family that walked out before us.  The waiter Chris was nice and polite which made me feel a bit awful leaving like that but I was not rude or mean either.  The management is definitely lacking. ... my daughter face says it all.

Anthony T.,"Webster, TX",4,79,4,1.0,6/29/2017,"TGI Fridays never stands out strong to me. I figured moving to a new town that things would be better. I was wrong. I ordered today online the black bean burger with avocado. Typically this burger is dressed with lettuce and tomato and onion and avocado. We only asked for no onions.  Once I got home the sandwich was the saddest thing.  Also I waited at the bar for the order. The bartender, Christopher, served me. He was pleasant but after I ordered a drink I wasn't ready to leave. He already rung up my little order. I was thinking come on and ask first.

Brittany T.,"Friendswood, TX",37,12,6,3.0,3/25/2016,"Warmly greeted at the front door to be promptly seated right next to to others families and told it was ""shift change,"" which is no excuse really to not be seated one table further than them. I was asked 2 separate times if I was ready to order while looking at my menu. I wish she understood that my mannerisms and general obvious indecision I had hence the looking AT MY MENU, that I was NOT READY TO ORDER YET. After a third time, I decided on the Ahi tuna ceasar salad which was quite good, but only came with 3 pieces of tuna. My bf got the half rack of ribs with 12 fries and a very tasty coleslaw with a bit of a bite.
