211,Pete A.,"Las Vegas, NV",578,146,207.0,5.0,2012-01-04,"I was killing time while my Toyota car was being serviced at the nearby Sansone's Independent Automotive - Henderson, NV dealership so I was able to shop around the malls and eat a sitdown meal. I chose to eat at Red Robin because I had eaten Mexican food the day before (the other option I saw for sitdown service was a Mexican restaurant across the way).  I don't know why others on here gave bad service reviews because my service was fast and the waiter was very friendly; and this was new years eve when the entire Galleria mall in Henderson was busy with shoppers. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with a side of ranch dressing and found it very delicious. I honestly ordered this because I liked the ingredients and I pulled up my yelp app to find a decent review of what to grab at the restaurant. I was thoroughly satisfied with my visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=200,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188
201,Juan G.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",0,19,,1.0,2012-02-09,Me and my wife went here on Super Bowl Sunday.  The place was empty!  We waited at the host stand a good ten minutes before the customer behind us got frustrated and went to get somebody who was more busy reprimanding people than helping us get seats as she looked our way.  The woman came over and sat us at a table.  We waited another ten minutes and never got acknowledged by anyone.  We were hoping to at least place a drink order but no one ever came.   We finally decided the wait was too long since we were starving and headed to the mall food court and had the best gyros from kyklos greek cafe.  This is the second time this has happened to us at this location.  I wrote the company about our situation and have yet to hear a response. Not that I care since I wont go back there.  The burgers are great here but I dont see fit in this economy to drop $10.00 for a burger plus drink and receive bad service when IN-N-OUT is right across the parking lot! DONT GO HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE! SERIOUSLY!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=200,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.724,2.96
250,Amy G.,"Henderson, NV",6,30,,2.0,2012-02-11,"We've been eating at this location on and off for a number of  years and lately, it has been less and less often because of the problems with service. We ate here yesterday, ironically using a gift card given to us a few months back by the manager due to horrible service that time. It doesn't seem to be any one thing that goes wrong - there is a just a general sense of this restaurant never being organized. If the service is speedy, the kitchen is slow. If the kitchen is fast, the food runners let food sit in the window. Or some combo thereof. The food is decent for a chain burger joint and we like the flexibility of the veggie burgers since we don't eat meat. However, Red Robin isn't the only place we can get a veggie burger.

237,Kevin Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,22,,4.0,2012-07-19,Ate here today with the family.  We were sat promptly and had to wait a little for a server.  The manager noticed this quickly and got on it and resolved the issue before we had to ask.  Our server Steph was great and attended to us with professionalism.  We have not been to this Red Robin in years and plan to continue to come back when in the neighbor hood.  Overall impressed.  Had the BLTA croissant for the first time.  Could use a little more avocado but I enjoyed it.  I recommend this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=220,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8960000000000004,3.1200000000000006
187,Ashley B.,"Las Vegas, NV",392,719,51.0,3.0,2012-08-21,"Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well.  My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not. We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc.  I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it.  Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him. Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does. Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7960000000000003,3.0400000000000005
246,Jane F.,"Henderson, NV",2,21,,2.0,2012-08-31,"My husband and I had the classic cheeseburgers.  We were there about 1 PM and the place was almost empty, which is not a good sign.  We substituted the coleslaw for fries. When the waitress noticed at we were not eating the slaw, she offered to bring us fries.  This was nice. They were okay, not great. I wasn't happy that when I held the burger and noticed that the bread was cold.  Toasting or warming the bun should be customary, otherwise, why am I buying a burger when I can make a better one at home?  Good thing that the bill was less than $30.  We will not come again.  Was it a disaster? No, but a return visit, I don't think so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=240,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6640000000000006,2.96

The place was busy! Good thing there was ample space, we got seated right away.  I enjoy the open concept that this place offers.  There's pictures everywhere and the wooden panels show character.  The server on the other hand, was really not impressionable at all.  I even forgot his name and I literally left about 20 minutes ago! Today I got the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad for $10.19.  As said on their menu, this dish includes ancho-grilled chicken breast, avocado slices and fresh-fried jalapeño chips on top of crisp greens.  I added the salsa-ranch dressing on the side. This salad is finished with diced red and green bell peppers and onions, black beans, roasted corn, cheddar cheese and crunchy tortilla strips.  This salad was good! The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  I greens and tortilla strips really offered some great texture.  I also enjoyed the fried jalapeño chips.  It was the right kind of bad that I needed LOL.  Everything together really made the dish a southwestern masterpiece!

134,Wendy H.,"Las Vegas, NV",32,26,174.0,5.0,2012-10-19,"Though it was my first time to Red Robin, overall the restaurant left me with a good impression! My friends and I came after an exam and it was close to where our school is. Also, got some shopping done since it is inside the Galleria Mall! Right when we entered, the service was quick and our server was really nice. The waiter came around multiple times throughout checking in when we needed refills on drinks and french fries. I had ordered the Burnin Love burger hearing from my friend that it was really good. And he was right! Though Burnin Love consist of fried jalapeno circle rings, it did not make the heat too spicy or ruin my taste buds. Rather, it gave a smokey taste in the burger. I usually can tolerate spicy really well, so that may be the reason as well. In addition, the burger is really filling! And the portion is decent! The seasoning that is available to be placed on your fries, be sure to try it! I love the dry spice seasoning, I never thought about such an idea! It made the fries have an explosion of flavors in your mouth. In addition, our server also brought us two sauces, ranch and a mustard poppy-seed one. Mustard poppy-seed was a new sauce for me, however, it was pretty good. If you are into a sweeter sauce, that one is a definite to try! I was very satisfied with the service and the food here.

181,Anthony G.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,155,17.0,3.0,2012-11-26,"Had a bit of a hiatus from writing reviews.  Needed to clear my head a bit because as you know this is very important and soul crushing work.  Well so begins review-a-thon 2012! I've been to this Red Robin several times over the years, back in the day it was a regular stop on Galleria Mall shopping trips.  Since the Internet has nearly completely taken over my life and I don't have a need for such a thing as a ""shopping mall"" I rarely find myself there anymore.  Somehow, someway it's become a meeting place for a group of friends of mine lately when we've all been in that area, so here goes: I've got to say that years ago Red Robin was probably my favorite Burger joint in Las Vegas with the exception of In N Out.   At that point all that I really knew was fast food burgers, so RR was always a breath of fresh air from those.   Well times have changed, and much like my Motorola RAZR in comparison to my iPhone, RR's burgers have taken a backseat to newer, sexier models of burger that I can get from places like Bachi, Fuku, or one of the 50 burger places that opened in the last 12 hours.   That being said, Robin still puts out a decent quality product for my money.  The beer is cold, the ingredients usually taste fresh, service is generally friendly and I'd be remiss not to mention the bottomless steak fries that you get with every order.  My favorite is probably the Burnin Love because jalapenos and burgers are one of my preferred combinations.   Ultimately I wouldn't recommend seeking out a Red Robin if you're craving a burger and are near one of the Bachi locations or even an In N Out, but if you find yourself trapped in the Build a Bear Workshop, Hot Topic, Abercrombie and Fitch or some other shopping mall clone at the Galleria one day and you don't feel like Sbarro, Red Robin might be worth a go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.572,3.2400000000000007
206,James P.,"Henderson, NV",6,5,4.0,5.0,2012-12-04,"I went in to Red Robin tonight because it was ""Jim Day""  to promote the return of the Jim Beam burger and my name just happens to be James. I walked over to the bar and the bartender Amanda came over right away and took my order. The free burger didn't come with fries, but they were offered to me so I added them on. I also ordered a beer while I waited for my food.  The burger and fries came out pretty fast and was delivered with ranch as well, which is always nice to not have to ask for. Amanda checked on me shortly after it came out to see if I needed anything. While I enjoyed my meal, the manager (didn't catch his name) who was working on various things said hello several times and asked me how the food was and called me by name (apparently he had been told I was taking them up on the free burger promo). Overall I found the staff to be very pleasant and I actually felt like they were glad I participated in the promo and appreciated me coming in as opposed to being treated like a freeloader who just came in for a cheap meal.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food at Red Robin, the burgers are good and the fries are okay, but I keep coming back to this location because the staff has always been consistently pleasant at this location. 5/5 for service, 4/5 for food, rounding up because I was treated right.

We are already on our way to our vehicle. The food on the other hand was great!!  I like how they finally changed the menu up to get more options, I am also happy that they no long serve your food in those crazy little baskets.  I did eat at one on Eastern, the service there is always amazing, I will only go to that one from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.18,3.2800000000000002

Anyway, Ruben and I met up with a couple of friends on a busy Sunday afternoon. They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI). I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger® and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger® (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a ""healthy"" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well. My verdict? That was my last time dining there.

But then, she didn't clean it up.  We were probably there another 20-30 min after the tea... there was still a puddle on the floor.   2.  Miserable service.  I got there last & my husband had asked the server to bring me water so it would be on the table when I got there.  That was there... but she never refilled it or asked me if I wanted anything else.  I wanted a soda - but never had the opportunity to order it.  My husband had also asked before I got there, when I sat down and again when we ordered, if we could have a basket of fries as a starter (we ordered burgers, so it was part of our food).  They didn't get there until the rest of our order got there.  I was there over 30 min before we got food - he'd been there almost 10 min before me.  40 min.  And it wasn't particularly busy.  There were a few groups at tables, but at 3pm on a Sunday - the place was over 50% empty.  We weren't checked on, even after we had issues with the food (see below).   3.  Mediocre (at best) Food.  When we finally did get food, it was mediocre at best.  My fries were ice cold.  They felt like they'd been sitting under the AC duct for a while.  I actually refused them because they were so cold.  My burger was passably warm and not particularly tasty.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wasn't great.  I could make something better at home.  My husband's burger was even less warm than mine.  He said it was ok, but would have probably been tasty if it was warm.  His daughter had a turkey sandwich and soup.  She says hers was excellent.... so 1/3 of the party was happy.

After a 40 minute wait we finally got the salad (which had been sitting for awhile). So of course we spoke with the manager who in turn gave us an apology and a $20 gift card. Mind you, we'd already paid for the salad ($11.77) so it wasn't much of a GIFT considering it wouldn't even cover the cost of a new salad after the difference. Nonetheless, we were happy with the offer and went home to eat. Opened the salad... And the lettuce was wilted and filled with water in the bottom of the container. I called back in to speak with the manager who was kind enough to put in a rush order for not only 1 but 2 new salads and said to still keep the gift card. Thanks, Jim!

Took about half an hour to get seated, but it was busy and at a mall location. Our initial waiter was nice, but the wait time for the food to arrive after we ordered took an hour. In that time I watched two tables finish their meals, and two new groups get seated and finish their entire meal before our food arrived. We had drank all our water while waiting so it would have been nice if our server came by to check on us and refill our water glasses. When the food finally did come it was delivered by the manager who apologized and blamed the cooks. A waitress came by a few minutes later with the sauces for our burgers. She said she noticed them in the kitchen and assumed it was part of our order. She seemed annoyed and unfriendly, but I couldn't tell if it was because of us or something else. The burgers and fries were decent -- not great, but not bad. We could tell that some of the burgers had been sitting a while because they weren't warm at all. The milkshakes were amazing. I was starving so I wolfed down my ""bottomless"" fries. I wanted to get more fries but our waiter had completely disappeared at this point, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to bring more out. Our waiter did show up again at the end to bring us the bill. I wasn't the one who paid the bill, but I was disappointed it wasn't discounted since we had to wait an hour for the food, that hour wait affected the quality of the food, and the service was not that great. When I've had bad experiences at other restaurants before, our bill was discounted/comped or we were offered some food as a make-good to make up for a bad dining experience, and those times weren't as ridiculous as our visit to this Red Robin. Verdict: if you want a warm/fresh gourmet burger next time, you'd be better off ordering a Six Dollar Burger at Carl's Jr. Or really, any other fancy burger chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.3120000000000003,2.92

This location is a bit difficult to get to with all the mall construction, but if you're looking for it from the inside it's in the middle of the upper level.  LOVE the bottomless fries! Had the California Chicken sandwich, and should have paid more attention because bacon, mayo, and avocado is really overkill on the same sandwich. Ended up ditching the mayo-soaked bottom bun - we're not counting calories on vacation, but damn! Decided to grab a couple drinks, and I wouldn't recommend the Long Island - ironically it tasted pretty much like a virgin mocktail, and had about the same effect. The Blue Moon shake is friggin' delicious, though, if you have room for some ice cream. :-)  Service was alright - I feel like this location is putting a lot of pressure on their staff to upsell drinks and desserts. Can't fault my server for that, so tone it down, management!  If I'm staying out in Henderson again, I'd return with a more selective eye.

I went to the restaurant on a week night, so it was not really busy...when I walked in, the hostess was busy talking to another employee and did not acknowledge me, so I went to the bar area instead. It took a little while for the bartender to see that I was there and get me a menu, but that was fine. After giving me the menu it was like he forgot about me.

85,Jasmine H.,"Las Vegas, NV",490,155,122.0,3.0,2014-12-05,"It's changed a lot since the first time I went a long while ago at least to this location, wayyyyy before I started yelping.  I guess they're trying to class it up a bit? The burgers and fries used to come in baskets but now they come on a plate which is cool but it's whatever to me. They'll still always be the same in my mind! But really we're here for the food....or at least some of us are. I decided to try the guacamole burger, minus the bacon (I don't do bacon, sorry!), and substituted mayo for chipotle aioli sauce and the regular burger for a gardein burger. So the subbing the burger for a vegetarian or vegan (they got those too) option was no charge....subbing the mayo for chipotle aioli was $0.50, it would be no big deal if there was actual sauce and if they asked me if it was okay/told me there would be a charge for subbing it. I tasted practically nothing but saw a smudge on the bottom of the burger. I'm not too happy about that. Not to mention the guacamole was a puree and well you could hardly tell it was there either. So this burger was a big bust for me and a serious disappointment.  Bottomless steak fries? I can always go for fries! They tasted the same as I always remembered. Nothing too special about them, I like it with a little bit more of their seasoning so thankfully they leave a bottle of that on the tables!  I rarely get dessert while I'm out eating dinner because I always over stuff myself, but this time I decided to treat myself and wished I didn't. I got a the red velvet cake. Normally you get a rich cream cheese icing with a moist cake. Well I got a dried cake that tasted like it was a couple days old not to mention left out all day and the rich cream cheese icing tasted nothing like cream cheese icing that I know. So I was doubly disappointed. They also ran out of all the seasonal taps that night but had one IPA on tap that I decided to try. It had a goose on it, I forgot the name, but I liked it. Nothing too special about this beer though.  I'm not a fan of being sat at by the bar, but that's where they put me and so I dealt with it. Next time I'm going to the Eastern location even if it's a bit farther from me.

When we finally got our waitresses attention she did take it and we couldn't figure out why it took her so long to come back.

It was late though and a few of our usual spots were already closed on a Tuesday night. After settling on Red Robin, we walked in to be greeted promptly. The hostess than had us wait a few minutes as she walked away, which I assumed was to clean a table. Needless to say, she returns and takes us in the opposite direction and attempts to seat us at a dirty table. She quickly noticed it wasn't clean and took us to another.... Which was dirty as well! WTF.... Clean the damn tables please. So we stand there awkwardly as she heads to find someone to clean it. I look around the corner and there is a dining area of about 15 tables that are all empty. I have worked in restaurants and know that the section was already closed and detailed but why keep us hovering awkwardly. Finally someone, who I guess was the manager comes and wipes down the table but leaves it much too wet. She tells us she will be right back to dry it off. At this point I am irritated, and not one person has yet to apologize. We sit finally and immediately notice how disgusting the floor is. That shit hasn't been swept in months it seems! Food, napkins, utensils and everything in between. I was horrified at this point and after waiting another 5 minutes for a server just got up and left. What a nightmare this place is!!

111,Brandy T.,"Henderson, NV",6,35,10.0,1.0,2015-02-18,"Red Robin has good burgers, but the one star is based on their service. I ate there at 7:30pm on a weekday. The hostess sat us a table top in the bar area, when the restaurant was not busy at all. The problem was the service in the bar area. We waited 35 minutes for our burgers to arrive at our table. They were luke warm and so were the fries, the fries were also the bottom of the bag fries, the ones you can't eat. During our 30 minute wait the waiter did not check on us after she dropped off our drinks. Everyone else in the restaurant, even people that arrived after us, had their food delivered to them.

We got one free burger because it was my 10th burger.  (I come to Red Robin a lot).  I am definitely not coming back in the next couple days again to receive the birthday burger.  Bartender tried to explain the confusion, still did not make sense.  Manager came back and tried to explain again.  At that point we just wanted to pay and leave.  Clearly the bartender is banging the manager because he went in the save a couple times.  Do not come to this location for the excellent service, you will not receive it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=100,2.92,2.91,2.91,2.18,2.9139999999999997

221,Nikki W.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,,1.0,2015-02-23,"Where to start...well let's just say we will never come back to red robin. we went at around 230 in the afternoon and didn't leave Red Robin till after 4. we were told the wait would be about 15 20 minutes which turned into 30, fine I understand that some places get busy not a big deal. We sat down we were greeted by Irene she seemed very sweet. She took our drink order and we also put in the kids meals right away too. my sister was visiting out of town so it was me, my mom, my sister and her daughter and my son. we also ordered chips and salsa. we got our drinks right away but couldn't get our appetizer for at least 15 minutes and the kids meals never arrived. I asked her what was going on she said she didn't know all that she knew was that the kitchen was backed up. so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait.  no manager ever came to apologize or ask us if we were okay, we also watched three different tables walk out. our food finally got there after 40 minutes but it was just me my sister and my mom's food, still no kids meals!!! we said that this was unacceptable and we asked to have our kids meals and why they were not there. a girl came by and said to Irene it was never put in, the kitchen had no ticket for it. finally the other girl ran back to the kitchen and got our kids meals after another 10 minutes. we still were missing one of the sides with the kids meals and it also never came. all of our food was cold it was awful but we still ate it because we were so hungry and had waited so long. finally we got the bill because we just wanted to get out of there and nothing had been discounted or taken off for all that we had been put through. so I asked for the kids meals to be removed, which they did and it took 12 dollars off of our bill. not to mention that the place was pretty dirty and it seemed like nobody really cared. We also watched one of the male servers walk by and wipe his nose with his hand like he had a cold, at that point I put my burger down and was done eating. I am a former server myself I have done this my whole life and never have I been the type to complain but this was the worst thing that we have ever seen in a restaurant and the lack of people to care. usually a manager comes over and tries to reassure the table or will give you some type of comp or let you know that they care and this did not even happen. never have we been so disappointed.

Just another mass marketed chain burger restaurant. I came for lunch with visitors from the 808. This location its inside the Galleria Mall. It actually decent size for shopping mall location.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It really comes down BBQ burger with fried onion rings and the basic works inside. I had no idea you could order half size or smaller size they call it. I ordered the regular size. My friend she ordered small size even then felt like that decent size. It came with your choice of sides stuck with tradition steak cut fries. The fries was not very good, under seasoned, not very hot and crispy out of the fryer. The burger thought was good. I definitely had better the same concept at other burger joints around town. We all shared the stack of onion rings. Again just ok. The presentation was kind of cool but once grabbed one nothing special about them. If anything tasted like frozen pre battered onion rings then fresh ones. Overall would say not the worst place in the world could go for burger but probably be my last last choice. The service was ok. I thought was odd that the server was passing us the bill from behind our booth in service station. Rather then coming up to the table more professional.

They brought my toddler's drink in a regular class and not a child's cup. The manager did manage to get all of us the right orders (except my burger as I didn't want to wait for an additional burger).  The kids meals were brought with the appetizers rather than with our meals.

I was happy to see they didn't drown my plate in French fries like a lot of other places do.

33,Nate M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3905,670,4519.0,2.0,2015-06-15,"Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular.  This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here. When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy.  We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, ""No, not yet"", ""oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back"", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water.  The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin.  The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock?  Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant?

Never received a refill after that, When I asked said, ""I'll bring it right over!"" Never came and asked again and never got it. Got my order wrong, never came by for refills, was rude to neighboring tables and could clearly see the look on their faces. Asked for a basket of fries and get them shoved in my face before I could even finish my sentence. And they were clearly from the table behind us that didn't want theirs with salt on it.

Asked another server for a rag or napkins, given 2 napkins to clean it up I asked the hostess for a rag because all I did was smear it, she said I'll bring you one, never did. As I saw our server to get the check he was bringing drinks to the table behind us, left a trail of water spilling out of the glass and 3 other employees walked right over it over a 5 minute period. I got the check left the money our server immediately grabbed it walked away and then said thanks for coming in. On the way out alerted the hostess that she never got the rag, then she said , ""oh I'll get right on that "" Didn't get a thank you or have a nice day. All in all poor service, can't get a simple order right and no one has any concern for safety.

The beer my husband wanted they ran out. He asked her what she would recommend and she didn't have too much suggestions so my husband end up having water. Then our food arrived. There was no utensils and waited for our waitress but she was no where in site so we used the device. On top of the device it was blinking red so the staff could see we needed help. We counted 10 staff members passing by looking directly at the device and did not check to see if we needed help. Our fries was cold and stale and we got our food.

89,Chris V.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,9,,2.0,2015-09-21,"After several hit-and-miss visits to this Red Robin location we decided to try again with a free Tavern Double burger offer.  Our previous visit in August had been wonderful, with good food and great service, so we figured what the heck. The visit included me, my daughter, and my wife.  My wife got the chicken and shrimp, my daughter got the poutine fries, I got the free tavern double burger, and we all got a tower of onion rings.  Our server started out pleasant enough, but after we ordered he essentially disappeared, only checking back once.  I'm not sure when Red Robin decided to stop filling the ketchup containers, but the one on our table was nearly empty, we grabbed the one on the table next to ours and it was almost empty too. My daughter liked the poutine fries, which were hot and flavorful.  My wife didn't care for her dinner, although hot it was lacking in the flavor department.  My tavern double was also hot, but had absolutely no flavor at all.  Onion rings were perfect.  Red Robin now utilizes the Zoisk table interface for most features you would have originally used a server for, which I'm not certain is such a great thing.  Upon reviewing the bill I noticed my tavern double hadn't been taken off the bill.  I used the button to call over the server, who explained that once I entered my loyalty number the burger would be removed from the bill, and indeed it was.  Paying through the interface is hassle free, and the ability to leave comments immediately is nice, however I was asked if I'd be interested in the longer survey which would be sent to my e-mail, so far no survey has arrived.  This isn't the first time that Red Robin hasn't seemed interested in the opinion they seem to be seeking.  After my last Yelp, Red Robin Management contacted me wanting my e-mail so we could correspond, but once I sent my e-mail I received no further response. Longer story short, we went back the very next night, due to a friend having a free birthday burger.  Food quality and service were no better - and again I left a long response via the Zoisk interface and also agreed to a longer survey by e-mail and still haven't received any response by management.  For example, waited at least 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken, being asked if we would like some fries while we wait - 20 minutes later, food comes, and we're still waiting for the fries...the table next to us had been their before we came and we got our food first and this was after almost a 45 minute wait!  I can't see spending good money on mediocre food and service when there are so many better places to spend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80,3.4,2.91,2.91,2.2800000000000002,3.106

The location was very busy (around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night) but we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Our server was friendly and helpful, and we were able to watch several football games on different TVs while we waited for our food. The only reason this review gets four stars instead of five is because we waited a pretty long time. When the food came out, I realized I had ordered the wrong burger entirely (my mistake!) and they immediately offered it to replace it for me for free. Thank you Red Robin! Another thing I liked about this location is the little iPads at every table. You can either pay $1.99 to play trivia games throughout your meal (no thanks!) or pay right at the iPad by credit or debit card instead of waiting for your bill (yes please!).

When we tried to order our appetizer she was a bit snarky telling us she doesn't take appetizer orders and that we should order them ourselves off the kiosk on the table.  She attempted to show us how to order from the table then got frustrated because the machine wasn't working. She said she would be back after she activated the machine.  She walked away annoyed.  She returned, placed our app order and her demeanor was a bit nicer, she took our dinner order at this time as well.  We then proceeded to wait 40 minutes with no appetizers nor visit from the server. We were just about to walk out and go somewhere else for dinner when our meals arrived.  No appetizers just our entrees. (cold) We told the kind young lady that brought our food we hadn't received our appetizers but no longer wanted them.  A few minutes after we received our entrees our server showed up with the appetizers.   We sent them back. The likelihood of us returning is slim to none however, I gave this review two stars for one reason alone and that would be the assistant manager Doreen.  She tried to make everything as right as possible.  She took over for our server and was extremely attentive.

25,Chris V.,"Henderson, NV",773,898,4988.0,4.0,2015-11-18,"I said I would've given it four stars last year if not for the fries. Well, I figured out a fix for the fries. Went back to Red Robin for my birthday again. As I said before, sign up for their rewards program (Red Robin Royalty) and they'll load a free burger onto your account annually during your birth month. You'll hardly have to buy your own food if you find enough places like this. Anyway, the fries thing. I asked for them to cook 'em longer on both occasions. It didn't work perfectly the first time (only a little better than the standard cook), but the bottomless steak fries definitely came out golden brown with mostly crunchy potato pieces on the second attempt. This batch was almost everything you want from fries. They're underseasoned, but just add sufficient amounts of ketchup and the Red Robin Seasoning (salt, pepper, paprika, other various spices) and you'll be fine. Or you can do with the salt and pepper grinders if that's your thing. (UPDATE 11/7/17: You can just say ""extra crispy"" to order the fries this way. I also suggest checking inside the menu for 5 complimentary sauces which you can request on the side. The ""Secret Tavern"" sauce is that creamy light-orange stuff that you'll often find everywhere by different names.) The burger was good too. This year, I went for the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (normally $10.69) with ciabatta. I listened more closely this year and realized that the server told me that my options were ""no pink"" or ""a little pink."" This gave me more realistic expectations for the meat color, and I'd say that the patty was indeed ""a little"" pink. The ciabatta was a nice, sturdy alternative to the standard bun. The burger overall was a sweet and savory treat with the namesake BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. I might consider asking for it again without mayo since that dulled the BBQ sauce's flavor a bit. Service felt a bit sluggish with my order taking longer to start than I thought it should've, compounded by server confusion. The host didn't explain upon seating me at the bar (not my request) that I'd be ordering with the bartender-esque server, and that server didn't really introduce herself and/or explain that she'd be taking my order. I guess it wasn't so bad because the place was pretty packed at about an hour past peak lunch. After I finally got in the order, things ran smoothly enough. Well, aside from the air vent expelling cold air directly onto me, but I was fine in my jacket. Your mileage may vary. As I said before, I'll be back here or at another Red Robin every year. It's not a premium burger, but it's solid casual dining and it's fantastic when it's free. (UPDATE 12/10/15: fried mushroom app is decent, fried mozzarella stick app is very average, and #NameThatChicken burger might not even be as good as some of McDonald's ""premium"" chicken sandwiches. But at least the burger was free to people with names similar to Saint Nick or Kris Kringle.

They have quite a few gourmet burger selections, and the prices were as high as I remembered from my first visit. But considering the prices of burgers, especially gourmet ones, they didn't feel outrageous as in the past. I went with the Royal Red Robin burger, with egg and bacon. It was really very good. A milkshake for $3.99 added on, it was about $18 all in with tip.  No complaints here, service was good, and you do your check out right at the table with the electronic pad.

139,JoAnne M.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,18,,2.0,2015-12-21,"Here's a recent update:  Having returned because of a very nice manager, we were unhappily surprised by changes.  To wit:  They have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food (yes, I know they have them at Applebee's, and that's why we never eat there).  You use them order your appetizers, drinks and desserts.  The only thing you order from the server is your entree.  When our server showed up - after a really long time - she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before.  I don't care.  Your job is to be on time, not making customers wait.  Then when I questioned her about the little kiosk, she told us everyone has them now (no, they don't) and also told us she didn't have to worry about her job because she was 'irreplaceable.'  Really?  The cemetery is full of irreplaceable people.  After we ordered, we never saw her again.  (The food was brought out by an expediter).  She never even refilled our drinks, or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any good. So here's the bottom line:  Order appetizer from kiosk.  Order drinks (non-alcoholic) from kiosk.  Order entree from server.  Order dessert from kiosk.  Pay with a credit card at kiosk.  Practically self-service now.  Since the server is doing 1/4 of the work (3/4 being done by machine) does she deserve a full tip?  No.  Only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip.  If I want self-service, I'll get fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=120,3.04,2.89,2.89,2.248,2.95

This place is OK if you want convenience in the mall and if you keep your expectations low. I've got no problem with the burgers, but you're rolling the dice with service. After a five minute wait to be sat on a Saturday night around 7 PM, we had about a five minute greet after being sat in the bar area and the service seemed to be a step behind for the rest of the meal especially with order delivery and refills. The burger selection, which they group into three categories, is actually pretty large: gourmet, finest, and tavern. There are also salads, $3, $5, $7, and $9 apps, chicken entrees, and soups. We kept it pretty simple ordering the Tavern Double for my wife, the Sautéed Shroom burger for me, and sharing regular fries. I can't complain about my burger, ordering with pink, it was juicy with healthy serving of mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese on the burger. The fries were sufficient. I have had most of the gourmet burgers and they're all good depending if you have a craving. The Chili Chili Cheeseburger is a combination on a burger that I like that is isn't offered in a lot of places. I swiped my credit card at the table and paid.

87,Gerard M.,"Escondido, CA",41,38,9.0,2.0,2016-03-21,"I have been a fan of Red Robin since the beginning. I generally love the fries and the Royal Red Robin burger. I recently moved to the Las Vegas area so I was used to quality service and food in my old Escondido, CA location. However, I tried eating at the Galleria location for the first time back in October and the service was slow and the fries were cold. I thought it was a fluke, but I went again with the same result, slow service and cold fries. After the 4th visit with the same results, I've concluded that this place has a problem. Then I went to another Red Robin on Eastern and had the same problems. Is it truly impossible to receive hot fries without complaining about it? Maybe these Red Robins in Henderson should reach out to the Escondido location and emulate their practices, because these two have been disappointing.  Also, the Galleria spot has a section that I always seem to be seated at that sits flush up against the mall entrance, so you essentially become a spectacle for about 1000 people as they walk into and out of the mall. It makes it feel like I'm eating at a hotdog on a stick in the food court, when all I wanted was a nice atmosphere to eat in. I don't want an audience to stare at me while I stuff my face with a Royal. The extra star I give them is for being on point with the burgers, those did not disappoint. Update: Since writing this I have been notified by their corporate office that these locations will be reviewed and might be remedied. I will be heading back to the Galleria location and I'll update my review with whether or not they are still dishing out cold French fries or not. Hopefully they will put up a wall in that section in front of the entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80,2.56,2.82,2.82,2.472,2.716

We were famished when we arrived we were sat at a table in a timely fashion and we had a waitress take our order within the first 10 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back apologize for the slowness of the food, filled up our drinks and told us that it wouldn't be much longer for our burgers. Despite this we waited almost another 25 minutes before our burgers came out and we could finally start eating. My burger was not very hot when it arrives and the fries were soggy. My friend's burger was dry and the meat was over cooked. She told the waitress this when she came back to check on the us and the only compensation she would offer is to make her  another burger. This was after we had waited over an hour for our food and were so hungry by the time the food finally arrived. Quite disappointed with the service and the quality of food this time for the prices we paid. I am not sure would dine there again.

I got the BBQ burger which was made of bacon, patty, and some other accoutrements I can't think of. Pretty much every burger had bacon in it.

When our food was served, we had to ask for silverware. We had to ask for water refills and be patient about getting them. It took ages to get anyone's attention to ask for more of the bottomless fries, and it took about 20 minutes after asking for them to bring us a measly amount. We would've like to have had more, but decided against asking as we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them. At least the food we *did* get was good. The new little ordering tablets they have on the tables would be awesome if they were there to supplement the service (as I imagine they're intended to do), but it appears some of the staff view them as a replacement for face-to-face service. We come here for the food. We don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. But when the server has such an attitude and scarcely appears after being seated, it doesn't make us keen on coming back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=20,3.0,2.9,2.9,2.024,2.9400000000000004

Sorry I didn't take photos of the food. I had the BLTA turkey croissant sandwich. Bread was dry, 1 thin piece of turkey and the texture of the bacon seemed like it was microwaved. Did I forget to mention the amount of mayonnaise that was put on both sides of the bread?! No exaggeration, about a 1/4 cup!  I had a side of broccoli that was flimsy  over-cooked and slightly browned. I had a side of fruit that was browned and dry.  Seemed like my food came from a run down gas station deli. My refill glass of strawberry lemonade had previously dried strawberry seeds on the rim! The manager was called over. We explained our experience. He came to our table dragging his feet. He didn't care to hear a word and was quick to say we will deduct the meals and sides from the bill. By the way, the manager admitted to the broccoli being microwaved.

6,Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",269,546,370.0,3.0,2017-05-27,"I like Red Robin in general. They have some interesting burger options aside from the standard. I especially like their mushroom burger as it is garlic heavy and loaded with mushrooms. But I always try to get something different when I come in. Usually I get a burger but I have tried a chicken sandwich as well. One thing sticks out in my mind at this location in particular. The food doesn't seem as fresh as it should. The fries are thin and over cooked for being steak fries. And the bun, whether on a burger or a chicken sandwich, always seems to be dried out. Dried to the point of breaking and crumbling. Almost stale you could say. The over all taste of the sandwich is alright but having a disappointing bun just leaves me feeling less than satisfied. I've not noticed this at other Red Robin locations. Mostly just this one.  I will say the service I recieve once I am seated is usually pretty good. I am typically shown to the bar section to sit either at the bar or a high table. Being a single diner I suppose is the reason for that. But the person behind the bar, despite always being busy, is rather attentive. My order is taken right away and typically comes out quickly. Hard to complain about that. I don't always end my meal with dessert but when I do, Red Robin has me covered. They have some cool alocholic desserts. Just the other night I had a root brewskie float. Alcoholic root beer poured over vanilla soft serve. I've also tried their Guiness beer shake. Any of their adult geared desserts are a fun departure from chocolate cake and ice cream.

I received a chicken sandwich with a completely soggy bun and limp lettuce. I took the sandwich apart ate the bacon out out and nothing else. My water was empty my entire meal and never got refilled. Our waitress never came to check on us while eating so there was never a chance to complain. And when coming to tell us how to pay she didn't care to acknowledge the fact my food was barley touched so I did not care to leave a tip higher than a dollar. This has now occurred on three separate occasions we have waited for around 20 mins for drinks to be taken and had terrible service through out our meal as well as very very poor quality food. I don't understand why the restaurant was upgraded in the past only to lose a lot of business and not seem to care about customer service or the quality of food any longer.

18,Mike T.,"Henderson, NV",1,13,,1.0,2017-10-08,"Been here 5 times in the last 3 months, and every time my family and I had to wait approximately 20 minutes bridge we got drinks. The servers ALWAYS say they have a ""big party"" in the back. Never been there during rush times, only 3-4 tables are occupied and the servers are always talking. The food is always fine, but the service is ALWAYS lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.52,2.65,2.65,,2.598

7,Erica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,9,26.0,5.0,2017-10-21,This location gets pretty busy as it is located inside of the Galleria Mall. They've done some remodeling and it looks very modern and nice. I sat in the bar area and Chandra was our waitress. She was awesome and attentive. I got the royal burger which is my go to and it never disappoints. The bottomless fries are always a plus!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.84,2.68,2.68,,2.744
11,Shelby V.,"Grandville, MI",13,31,2.0,1.0,2017-11-11,"I have not been to a Red Robin since 2010 so I don't know if it's a decline in food quality or the fact that I was in high school and had no taste at the point but we visited the other day and it was meh. The server was decent and we noticed that three tables in 5 minutes were getting something comped from their bill. We weren't sure if this was the server or the restaurant but we should have paid more attention. My chicken sandwich was average, but not worth the 10.00 and my boyfriend was the least satisfied. He asked for the bottomless root beer float but instead of rootbeer he'd like coke. The server brought the rootbeer float AND a glass of coke, even after explaining, again what he wanted, no fix. Then his burger came out and he took two bites and wanted to leave. Thank god we can pay by card at our seat or we would have waited ten minutes to flag someone down. Next time I know to save the 40.00 and go elsewhere. Oh and he asked for fresh jalapeños on his burger as that was an option and got deep fried instead. He said it was all mush and that also killed the burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.68,2.67,2.86,,2.6740000000000004
13,Biruk S.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,5.0,2017-11-13,"I went to Reb Robin on Friday (Veterans Day observed) and say they had the ""Table Set for One"" on display for customers to observe. I thought that was very heartwarming given the Holiday and I love how they included that touch to honor Veterans. On top of that the service the waitress provided was exceptional. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was the nicest lady who did her best to ensure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. When the food came it was exactly how we ordered and fresh off the grill. Amazing service, great food, and they honored our veterans.. what more can you ask for? Great job Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.8,2.69,2.864,,2.734
47,Brock H.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,,2.0,2017-11-16,Only reason they're getting two stars is because the food was alright. Ordered the ghost tavern.. Burger was good and I love their fries.. That being said the customer service was horrible! This seems to be a recurring issue every time we go. The only reason we go back is because the food is decent. We only saw our server once and that was to take our orders. I ordered an appetizer and that was never brought out..when I finally did get the attention of another server to let them know we were out of ketchup and needed more they brought us back a bottle that expired in June and  was PURPLE! And when they advertise bottomless fries I expect to get bottomless fries. Not one small basket of 6 fries throughout my entire meal. I've also eaten at the red Robbins on eastern and the service there was not much better..Red Robbins needs to get some serious training on customer service asap because I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could do better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=40,2.84,2.66,2.86,,2.732
21,Jason S.,"Valencia, CA",6,37,2.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"I'm going to be honest here, the service sucks! When you have your wife and 2 daughters come in and your onion rings and burgers are soggy and cold! You have to wait for 20 minutes at a time with cups full of ice and a splash of coke and put it on repeat several times. Plus when he gave us our utensils, he handed my 2 year old a steak knife!! Not to mention I told the hostess Mallory that it was my birthday and mentioned it to the server. No birthday song and all of that stuff. I spoke with management and they said "" you got your food right?"" No care at all. Just steer clear and spend your money at McDonald's or in and out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=20,2.8,2.65,2.86,,2.71
2,Brad D.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,103,10.0,3.0,2017-12-06,Standard burger fare. I get a salad as I don't find their fries good enough to warrant an endless option. Ghost chili burger was less spicy than the Sriracha burger. Wait staff can really make or break your experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.88,2.66,2.856,,2.748
9,Sherry R.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,13,2.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"We have been visiting this establishment for years and after our visit last night we will never go back again. The waitress was terrible, we had to ask anther waiter for utensils after our meal arrived. We ordered our food before 2 other tables and got our food last. The food came out incorrectly. We asked for a manager and when she arrived she did not tell us she was a manager she asked if we wanted refills on our waters. So disappointed in Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.84,2.63,2.844,,2.7139999999999995
1,David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,25,14.0,1.0,2017-12-22,"I love Red Robin. It's always a top 5 restaurant when my wife and I are deciding on where to eat. This particular location is the worst I've been to.  The floors are sticky. The hostesses were unhelpful and dismissive. The bathrooms look like they havent been visited by a cleaner in hours. Our server didn't introduce himself and got right into ""are you guys ready to order?"" Followed immediately by ""hold on I'll be right back. I forgot my pen"".  All of this still isn't a dealbreak for me because of how much I love the food.  The way the kitchen looked when I left the bathroom is another story. The photo I posted speaks for itself. This place is filthy. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.76,2.63,2.832,,2.6819999999999995
14,Richard R.,"St. Joseph, MI",0,5,,4.0,2017-12-22,"I like their burgers and fries. My complaint was about the cleanliness at the Galleria-Henderson location. I noticed really bad greasy finger prints all over the glass divider where I was sitting. It was disgusting and I'm a guy. You need to look through this glass to see outside. I mentioned this to the waitress but received no real response. I later emailed corporate with my complaint with the location. I received a response a few days later saying that they have notified the manager of the location. Problem was they had the wrong location listed, not even the right city. If you can't respond correctly don't respond at all. Obviously they don't much care. This was bad enough that it somewhat ruined my lunch because I couldn't help but think about what else was not cleaned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.8,2.65,2.828,,2.71
0,Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"My mom and I were shopping at the mall and decided to have lunch here.  They were quite busy so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Not bad at all. Our waitress came by pretty quickly and said she would be right back.  She came back shortly and took our orders.  She was a bit slow explaining the check process with their on-table machines.  So we did end up checking out through the machine but it was out of paper so we never got our receipt. I started with the fried pickles.  They come with a spicy sauce but the waitress asked if I wanted ranch for them.  I said yes but when they came they had the spicy sauce.  Later though she brought me ranch. I had the Banzai burger in a lettuce wrap.  This is a tasty burger with pineapple and lots of cheese.  A bit hard to eat in the lettuce so you end up knife and forking it but its still good.  And I love their fries.  The serving of fries was a bit smaller than normal but I think they are unlimited so we could have asked for more. Mom had the Southern Charm burger.  She had asked for no produce but still wanted the grilled onions, bacon and cheese.  Well they messed it up and brought tomato and no onions.  Mom ate it anyway and said it was okay. So a bit a miss on a few things but overall not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.84,2.64,2.824,,2.72

I always ask for a specific table and always tell them I don't like booth because is too tight for my big body. They continuously ignore me and take me to a booth. Today, after been taken to a booth again I reminded her the table requested. She took us there but a family was just given the table. No apologies from the girl, just told me to pick another table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2,2.72,2.64,2.816,,2.672
