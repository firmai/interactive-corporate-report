32,Tammy M.,"Puyallup, WA",29,59,27.0,2.0,2012-04-15,"We had a lay over at Oakland. We went to grab a pizza 30 minutes before closing. They said that they were out of pepperoni, they said that they were out of cheese pizzas, and they had about 6 signature pizzas made up. I left found pretzals for the kids and came back for the thai pizza. Kid ya not I watched several families leave because they were too lazy to whip up a cheese pizza.  The staff is unfriendly, the attitude was heavy and felt like, if u don't like the premade pizzas, than tuff dootie.

The staff was friendly, the wait for cooking wasn't too long, and the pizza wasn't bad.

17,Kevin S.,"Ashburn, VA",120,703,414.0,1.0,2013-05-15,"Terrible. This place is a disgrace to the CPK name.   My family and I LOVE CPK and were SO excited when we found out there was a CPK at the airport when we had a layover there.   DON'T BOTHER. I think the pizzas are pre-made somewhere else and then brought to the airport because they had a limited inventory of each type.  They were out of most of the types we wanted and we settled for what was left in stock.  After placing our order and paying for it, the employee at the counter subsequently informed us, ""We're out of that, too.""  We had to downgrade to plain cheese pizza, and he didn't even offer to refund us the difference in price since we had paid for a pizza with something else besides cheese on it.   When the pizza came it was NOT fresh.  The pizza was overcooked.  The crust was hard and crunchy.  In short, this was NOT CPK by any stretch of the imagination. Save your money.  Go get some nasty premade airport sandwich in the newsstand fridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

16,Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",755,1190,171.0,2.0,2013-08-21,"Oakland's Terminal 2 is looking pretty good these days.  For reasons that I can't reconstruct, I ended up at the California Pizza Kitchen after looking at other options that seemed more attractive.  I went for the lunch combo that includes a small soup and a half-sandwich. Neither was especially good.  I began with a tortilla soup that seemed unnaturally thick; I wondered how much corn starch or flour had been poured into it.  Thankfully, the tortilla strips were served on the side and were not already waterlogged when I sat down to eat the soup.  The other half of the combo was a tuna salad sandwich that came pre-made and pre-wrapped.  The bread was accordingly kinda soggy, and the tuna salad was OK at best. California Pizza Kitchen would be a standout at the United gates as Dulles Airport but does not come across as a winner in the current T2 lineup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
23,Jennifer D.,"Houston, TX",313,81,5.0,3.0,2013-10-30,"Some times, you have to cave in and get overpriced airport food. As I made my way past all the different food spots, I saw the familiar yellow CPK sign. ""YES! YES! YES!,"" my tummy shouted. I arrived at the counter, and two workers were by the oven. I waited by the cashier for about a minute, and no one acknowledged me. So, I spoke up and asked the workers, ""Are you guys open right now?"" That got their attention, and they finally took my order. I ordered the BBQ chicken, which took about 10 minutes to bake.  The pizza was good enough - the same taste that I am familiar with, but warm instead of fresh-out-of-the-oven, which is weird because it supposedly JUST came out of the oven. Better than most food court pizzerias, but definitely not CPK-standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland?start=20,,,,,
14,Kasia G.,"Carmel, CA",27,91,170.0,4.0,2014-05-23,"I just ran .5 of a mile to get this pizza. Haven't tried it yet but running & getting my pizza only took 20 minutes. I was bummed out that it was too early for non breakfast pizzas when I arrived. Only egg pizzas were being served & I was about to lose it! BUT, the 3 employees working all decided to open up the lunch menu for me at 8:30am. Yay!  I wanted a nice fluffy Hawaiian pizza & as I look at it, it looks pretty good. Can't be as good as the actual restaurant dining in so that's why 4 stars but glad I got my pizza fix for my flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,,,,,
11,Bryan G.,"Meridian, ID",135,86,35.0,4.0,2014-09-30,"Only reason I enjoy flying into Oakland is a chance to eat some CPK in this airport. It's directly off of the southwest gates so if you fly that airline you'll be very close.  CPK,  is one of my favorite California meal locations. Although this location isn't on par with actual standalone locations,  it still gets high marks given what it is. Wait times are usually quoted as 14 minutes and it's pretty accurate. If you have a connection I wouldn't recommend this as a dining option. Remember most planes board 30 minutes from scheduled departure.  If you do have the time enjoy some fresh cooked pizza. Although the pizzas are pre prepared they are cooked to order in an open fire oven. The selection is decent with most popular pies getting billing.  Expect to pay around 10 to 16 dollars depending if you get a drink or not.  Overall I always stop here If I have the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,,,,,

18,Amanda D.,"Vancouver, WA",3,5,,1.0,2015-03-30,"I fly from the Oakland airport every two weeks. Often, my gate is right next to CPK. I actually make a game out of the terrible service people receive from this location. Often, someone at the register is ignoring a line of people wanting to make a purchase. Today I watched a line of 5 people dwindle down to one from people lacking patience while waiting for the staff to finish their conversation to be helped. Then I watch the successfully patient customers as they receive their order incorrectly and have to argue with the staff to get it corrected.  This ""game"" has entertained me for a year now. I strongly believe the owner of this location needs to question how the staff is representing cpk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,,,,,

Okay, that's about the only Oakland rap you'll get out of me :)  ~ About this location: Simply a convenient CPK with packaged sandwiches, salads, fruits, refreshments, and of course pizza!  This location sits across Gate 28, Southwest Terminal 2.  ~ Above average prices for what you get, but what do'ya expect!  I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza for $12.51.  Like WOW for a Totino sized pizza!  Yippee skippy (sarcasm)! ~ Service was ok, no issue. No smile, no rush, next customer!   ~ The highlight is watching your pizza get baked in the flamin' hot oven.   Tip: The Gordon Biersch a little further down has a brat and beer special.  I'd head over there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland,,,,,

I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza. It ended up filling me up. The taste is what you expect from any airport pizza.

7,Erica C.,"Escondido, CA",34,14,,1.0,2016-05-20,"I'm sorry. I don't write reviews too often but the terrible-ness of this pizza literally forced my hand.  Where should I start? Well, to begin with it costs $10 plus tax for a tiny, personal sized cheese pizza -- which, spoiler alert, tastes like microwaved cardboard. If you're craving a texture other than gloppy erasers, you'll have to spend $15. Airport prices. I get it. Except the crust is crappily thin, nearly burnt to a crisp, and has zero flavor. The tomato sauce tastes like it came from a can, and the cheese doesn't make the pizza taste any better. It's lumpy, misshapen, and overall just makes me wish I starved instead. A bag of chips would taste better than this expensive bullshit. I tried to trick myself into thinking the $11 I spent was sorta worth it. Needless to say, I failed. This pizza is just that bad.

One reason it cooks fast is that its a smaller, barely 12"" diameter pizza that a hungry person can probably finish.  It's also good for two people looking for a pre-flight snack.

Anyway they are above average even on a crowded day.  They only get four because they are located in an Airport and so seating and ambiance suffered.
