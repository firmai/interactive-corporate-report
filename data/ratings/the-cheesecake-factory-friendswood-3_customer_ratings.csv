272,Jesse E.,"League City, United States",10,14,2.0,1.0,2012-06-12,"We decided to try out the new location a week after it first opened. Being a friday afternoon we knew it would be busy and decided just to order take out. i called and was placed on hold for 15 minutes before someone finally took my order. That should have told me what was about to follow.      I ordered a burger medium rare and it was well done. The bun was soak through soggy.  The fries were soggy too.  I ordered onion rings as well and that failed to make it in the bag even though i was charged for it. My wife ordered a chicken pasta dish and you literally had to search for chicken. It was like an alfredo sauce and it was clumpy even after being reheated. I called to give feedback about our experience and again 10 minute wait for a manager to get on phone. If i was a manager and had customer complaint on the phone I'm making that a priority getting right to it. Its like they don't care. Just from my negative experience and talking to friends and family, there have been 20 or more people that changed their mind and took their business somewhere else. Sorry cheesecake factory, thats about $300 -$400 that you lost out on.  That place is not worth the wait.

262,Angela C.,"Houston, United States",0,9,13.0,1.0,2012-07-12,Very disappointed in the general manager and the lack of managing he has for his location! The wait for us was 2 hours...2 1/2 hrs later we are still waiting. No customer service skills what so ever. Our party fell by 3 ppl to 6 adults and still nothing. There were large groups leaving and we were told 30 min ago that we were next and that was obviously far from the truth. Wait staff and management were poorly selected and the restaurant should have anticipated a much larger turn out considering the location. Not even at the galleria are we having to wait this long. A new general manager who can handle this size restaurant should be looked into! Had high hopes but greatly disappointed.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

I had been to the Galleria location of The Cheesecake factory a few years back and every time I heard someone talk about The Cheesecake Factory I had a problem remembering if I enjoyed the food or not which should have been my 1st clue, but since it wasn't clear to me I decided to give the newly open Baybrook Mall location a shot. I knew I probably hadn't made the wisest decision  as soon as I was seated because the way the table was set, because at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" they sit all of your silverware directly on the table... Now let's pause for a minute and give that a second to set in... Yes ladies and gentlemen they set the utensils that you use to pick up food that's going in your mouth directly on the table. That same table that the bus boy just came by and wiped with the same rag that he used to wipe the other 39 tables in the dining area, can you say unsanitary? Not to mention there were residual crumbs of something still left on the table. Even Jim-Bob's BBQ knows to at least wrap the utensils in a paper towel.  So immediately my girlfriend and I asked for silverware that hadn't been placed on the table, and what's the 1st thing our waitress does when she brings them? Tries to sit them back on the same dirty table(yes I am shaking my head too right now). So anyway we order the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"", Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes, and two lemonades one strawberry and the other one regular. So the waitress brings out the lemonades and they are tartest lemonades I've ever had in my life. I guess when life gave The Cheesecake Factory lemons they squeezed them directly in a glass and served them to their customers. They must've had some idea of how tart the lemonade was because they put sugar around the rim of the glass which gave the lemonade all the class of boxed wine. And that's not all I haven't even started on the food yet. The ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" didn't have a sauce it had more of an oil with tablespoon upon tablespoon of black pepper ugh. The chicken was so charred it taste like I was licking a BBQ grill not to mention it had 6 of the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp pasta dish ever. The Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes was lifeless and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Cheesecake was one dimensional  .

They know this place is popular and out here this is the only location so you have many people coming from a larger radius area. All the food, drinks, and desert were all very good, it was busy but this was NYE and the time that I did go it was 550pm-6pm and the wait was only 1 hr. However the day before we tried to go and wait times were 50 to 70 minutes! So we waited and we waited less than an hour.  The food came out pipping hot and you could tell it didnt sit for long u if under warmers. The only complaints I have is parking and wait times for the place. Its in the same parking lot as the small its off in its own section but its still just not enough parking, they have a section for valet but honestly I would rather have more parking its just too small of an area so you have to park in more of the mall area and walk, its not far but still when you have a resturant like that you expect them to have more parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

We were a party of four made up of two 9 month pregnant women and our husbands. This was supposed to be our last outing before we have the babies. They said 45 mins to one hr wait. We waited while standing for 40 mins then my husband asked if we could sit out in the patio which was closed due to the cold. They said ok. We sat there for another hour and 20 minutes.  After several inquiries and my husband having mentioned we are very ovviously pregnant they gave us a table at 8:40.  But wait, the table was a small booth that made it impossible for our pregnant bellies to fit on both sides of the table.  The waitress said she would see what she can do. Then the manager came and said I'm sorry but if you want another table, it will be a twenty minute wait. But he suggested that if we both sit on the same side of the table and push the table toward our poor husbands we could fit!!! Unbelievable!!! We did that bc we were way too hungry to wait any longer. He made no apologies and no offer of an appetizer or any such thing for the discomfort and long wait. Then our waitress forgot several items we asked for, and our food did not come out together. To top it all off, when our meal was done our waitress was in such a hurry for us to leave,that when we ordered cheesecake she said would you like me to bring it in a take out box so you can just take the rest with you?

Asked for some, and the waitress brought silverware, no napkins. Had to separately ask for those too.  Drinks messed up 4 times. Diet vs. regular. Appetizer was some buffalo shooter fried thing. Terribly greasy, even for a fried dish, way overlooked and the grease soaked in. Asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a tiny cup for like eight pieces. Never arrived. Waitress blamed the kitchen.  Some guy came around like 3 times with random dishes, asking ""is this yours?""  Main courses were tasty though. Not sure if they were understaffed, but no one seemed in charge. Terrible experience overall.

This is probably not like any french toast you have ever had, this is BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST! They soak the bread in a wonderful creamy custard (I heard this is done overnight,but I have not verified that info) and then grilled; not baked or fried, GRILLED until the outside has a perfect crunch. I suggest you add bacon because these two belong together, the sweet and smoky flavors compliment each other. OH MY the syrup - sweet and buttery, simply Awwwwww Goodddddd!! The coffee is usually perfect; occasionally it comes out too weak/watery, but if you ask them to bring you a real cup of coffee they will do so without question.

Instead, I want to review the Sunday (ONLY) Brunch. I have had several brunch items and all of them are great, but it is the french toast that has us coming back every couple of weeks. This is probably not like any french toast you have ever had, this is BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST! They soak the bread in a wonderful creamy custard (I heard this is done overnight,but I have not verified that info) and then grilled; not baked or fried, GRILLED until the outside has a perfect crunch. I suggest you add bacon because these two belong together, the sweet and smoky flavors compliment each other. OH MY the syrup - sweet and buttery, simply Awwwwww Goodddddd!! The coffee is usually perfect; occasionally it comes out too weak/watery, but if you ask them to bring you a real cup of coffee they will do so without question.

That is probably the best time to arrive, and anymore after that, you will be looking at a very long time. Our party of 5 was seated promptly--just the location was awkward because we were seated near the door to the outside seating and whenever the door was opened, freezing air came through. I suppose this isn't a problem all year round.  Our server was an attentive lady and gave us supple time to decide on our orders. We were given the complimentary bread and we also asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Our starter was the eggroll sampler. It included the Crispy Cuban, the avocado, Firecracker salmon, and the Tex-Mex. It came with 4 different sauces that I think complimented each kind of eggroll nicely, however you paired it. I liked the tamarind-cashew sauce the best.  I opted for appetizers as my main course. I had the pear and bleu cheese flatbread pizza and the ahi tartare. The flatbread is very small, but coupled with the complimentary bread, the eggrolls, my other meal, and forking off of my sister's plate--it overall makes a filling dinner. The pizza has really nice flavour, btw. Pear and bleu cheese go so very well together. Highly recommend it! The tartare on the other hand... suuuupeeeerrrbbblyy--wait for it--SUBPAR. It was drenched in soy sauce which completely drowned the fresh flavour it's supposed to have. It came with 4 small crisps which did not do any justice. Bleh bleh.  My sister had the Eveleyn's Favourite Pasta--waitress points out it's a vegetarian dish as a reminder--and it tasted alright, as well. Not in love with it, but it had nice, smoky flavours with a kick from the seasonings. She just didn't like the super al dente state of the rigatoni.   My mom had the almond crusted salmon salad. She said it was pretty good. The vinaigrette coupled it well.  My dad had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta--he said it was a little spicy but it being jambalaya, well, he had to shut it. He enjoyed it, though.  My brother had the lemon-herb chicken which came with mashed potatoes and carrots. It's a big serving and we had leftovers to scarf home.  For dessert, we went for two items: I chose the limoncello cake and my mom went for the mango-key lime cheesecake. Let me tell you... I felt like a fata** after forking those desserts down. The limoncello was sweet but the cake part of it was a nice equal. Big slice of it, too.  The mango-key lime cheesecake was delicious. It paired sooo well; our forks were fending each other off from the last slice.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant does try to hold its name. Expect that this place is packed. From sitting to leaving, it took 2 and 1/2hrs... a lot of waiting, but if you've got good enough company and patience, then yes, I recommend a visit.  Just had one extra problem: one of our menus had spaghetti stuck between the pages. Yuck.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40,2.92,3.21,3.21,2.732,3.094

It included the Crispy Cuban, the avocado, Firecracker salmon, and the Tex-Mex. It came with 4 different sauces that I think complimented each kind of eggroll nicely, however you paired it. I liked the tamarind-cashew sauce the best.  I opted for appetizers as my main course. I had the pear and bleu cheese flatbread pizza and the ahi tartare. The flatbread is very small, but coupled with the complimentary bread, the eggrolls, my other meal, and forking off of my sister's plate--it overall makes a filling dinner. The pizza has really nice flavour, btw. Pear and bleu cheese go so very well together. Highly recommend it! The tartare on the other hand... suuuupeeeerrrbbblyy--wait for it--SUBPAR. It was drenched in soy sauce which completely drowned the fresh flavour it's supposed to have. It came with 4 small crisps which did not do any justice. Bleh bleh.  My sister had the Eveleyn's Favourite Pasta--waitress points out it's a vegetarian dish as a reminder--and it tasted alright, as well. Not in love with it, but it had nice, smoky flavours with a kick from the seasonings. She just didn't like the super al dente state of the rigatoni.   My mom had the almond crusted salmon salad. She said it was pretty good. The vinaigrette coupled it well.  My dad had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta--he said it was a little spicy but it being jambalaya, well, he had to shut it. He enjoyed it, though.  My brother had the lemon-herb chicken which came with mashed potatoes and carrots. It's a big serving and we had leftovers to scarf home.  For dessert, we went for two items: I chose the limoncello cake and my mom went for the mango-key lime cheesecake. Let me tell you... I felt like a fata** after forking those desserts down. The limoncello was sweet but the cake part of it was a nice equal. Big slice of it, too.  The mango-key lime cheesecake was delicious. It paired sooo well; our forks were fending each other off from the last slice.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant does try to hold its name. Expect that this place is packed. From sitting to leaving, it took 2 and 1/2hrs... a lot of waiting, but if you've got good enough company and patience, then yes, I recommend a visit.  Just had one extra problem: one of our menus had spaghetti stuck between the pages. Yuck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40,2.88,3.23,3.23,2.668,3.09

My last meal there was a Bacon, Bacon Burger that was truly one of the best burgers I have ever had. I'd like to close with a tip - The Cheesecake Factory now has an app you can down load that gives you a code to give to your server so you can see your tab and pay when you are ready to go rather than wait for a check.

Coffees were good (I added some chocolate icing to my mocha from the cheesecake because I'm shameless and have no self control when it comes to a chocolate. No regrets. The cheesecake was layers of brownie, cheesecake, chocolate cake and something with coconut and pecans (tasted similar to a German chocolate cake topping) if you're in the mood for something super rich this is the way.

It seems my dining experience decreases with every visit I make here, never improving on the many flaws it shows. You want to talk about over-rated, Cheesecake Factory takes the proverbial (cheese?) cake for that unwanted award.  Atmosphere: For a chain restaurant, the atmosphere is pretty decent for the layout. It's undeniable that this place is a popular dinner venue given the crowded capacity at night and the noise level it brings, but that doesn't appeal very much to me. Wait times vary, but most of the times I have visited it has usually been a 30 minute wait at minimum.  Service: Hit-and-miss at times, leaning more towards the lacking side of it. Sometimes you get waiters/waitresses that bend over backwards for their customers, while some don't look like they even want to be there (and poorly affecting the service quite a bit). This time around the service was decent, nothing too special but the waiter was doing his job well enough. Food: What a horrible mistake I make every time wanting to try different things the menu has to offer. They have a big menu, but it seems that every time I try something new the quality of the food goes downhill from there. Tonight was no exception, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms while my fiance had Miso-Glazed Salmon over rice. This dish I had gotten ranks as one of the worst dishes I have ever had, border-line inedible. The Chicken Marsala was almost tasteless, but even worse the little flavor it did have was strange and repugnant. The mushrooms, coated with the supposed ""Marsala"" around it was a disaster. The bow tie pasta resting underneath it while tender was completely bland and tasteless. I would assume they were hoping the Marsala sauce would be a good substitute for seasoning, but the sauce was already disgusting to begin with. For the first time in a while I reached over for the salt at the end of the table to somehow salvage this mess of this dish, but there was no salvaging this shipwreck of a plate. I couldn't come to finish it, I was severely disappointed with what I had ordered. My fiance's food wasn't any better, the salmon lacked any real glaze on top, and even worse the salmon itself was extremely dry and flaked in wadded chunks of culinary disaster. Our food was horrible, this was one of the worst meals I have ever had. We had cheesecake afterwards of course, but that didn't save the meal experience for us.  Conclusion: This place should honestly just stick to it's own name and make cheesecake, because that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this chain restaurant. While some of the food here has been decent to alright at best in the past (and that's being generous with my critique), the food served tonight was inexcusable. There's no saving this sinking ship unless they do a complete overhaul o their food and go back to the drawing board.

Ive gone here several time since I suffer from gluten issues and it seems every time I go something goes wrong. The first time I got a burger medium well and the meat was still raw. After explaining nicely to the manager that I would just like to get a cooked burger and was willing to drive back, he argued saying that a medium to medium well has pink on the inside and it was fine. I eat my steaks usually rare, I don't mind pink in the middle, what I do mind is getting a burger and it being raw. Finally after seeing the raw meat he apologized and said yes this was completely undercooked. Took care of my meal and I was fine with that. Even after being given a RAW burger, I still have gone back numerous times. I usually ask for my sauces on the side and they get that right about 15% of the time, but I'm not too picky, I suck it up and eat it with no problem. However, tonight, I wanted a gf bun. My husband gets home with it and it's wrapped in lettuce. Well, if I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger I would have gotten that anywhere. My husband called back and asked, nicely, if he could just bring it back and get a gf bun, the to go lady told him she was aware she gave him a lettuce burger and was rather rude on the phone. He asked to speak to a manger thinking maybe she didn't know. I live about 15 min. Away and it took the manager that long to pick up the phone. Once my husband got there they still were unsure why it was given like that. Finally after waiting they decided to tell him they ran out. Why couldn't the to go lady mention that. Maybe she didn't know, understandable, but for the manager to be so busy he couldn't listen to a customer request until he was already there is rather annoying. So now we had to get the whole meal replaced because his food was cold and gross and all the manager could do was comp mt burger and a free cheesecake? Honestly, I liked going here because of the gluten free options, but after being screwed over so many times I think it's time to move on. Luckily more restaurants, even nearby ones, are having more options for people with food allergies so I will start taking my business somewhere else, where my food will be cooked, managers won't argue and actually care about their job.

Once my husband got there they still were unsure why it was given like that. Finally after waiting they decided to tell him they ran out. Why couldn't the to go lady mention that. Maybe she didn't know, understandable, but for the manager to be so busy he couldn't listen to a customer request until he was already there is rather annoying. So now we had to get the whole meal replaced because his food was cold and gross and all the manager could do was comp mt burger and a free cheesecake? Honestly, I liked going here because of the gluten free options, but after being screwed over so many times I think it's time to move on. Luckily more restaurants, even nearby ones, are having more options for people with food allergies so I will start taking my business somewhere else, where my food will be cooked, managers won't argue and actually care about their job. It's not that hard.

I have been to Cheesecake Factory about 50x in 5 different locations and never had a problem at any other location. I have been here 4x and had a problem 3x already. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for returning, but this will be the last.  1st time: The warm crab & artichoke dip tasted different and I finally figured out why after 5 minutes....they added pieces of bread in the dip. I ended up returning it and the manager agreed there was bread in there and the texture of the dip didn't look normal. He did take it off the bill but I was so upset because I dined there that night because I was craving the dip. The entree was fine and service was just ok. 2nd time: I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the chicken strip were much smaller than usual but I didn't say anything. Service was horrible this time. We just left unhappy. 3rd time: Like a dummy I returned because I was craving the Thai lettuce wrap. The closest cheesecake factory is in the galleria area and too far to drive during rush hour. So I settled. They said they ran out of Thai lettuce wraps (not sure how a restaurant can run out of chicken and lettuce). I ended up ordering miso salmon.  It was good and the waitress was great. I had a pleasant dine in experience, finally! 4th time: Today I went with my family and I ordered the steak medallion for my mother. It did not look like the picture on the website or their screen display at all! I understand it's a small portion since it's on the skinnylicious menu but the picture in the website is the skinnylicious steak medallion since there is no other steak medallion on the full entree menu. There were 4 pieces of steak the size of a quarter each. All 4 pieces together was not even 1/4 of the picture.  Anyway I asked for the waiteaitress and her and another waitress agreed that it did not look like the picture. The manager came over and said well there's nothing he can do since he didn't see how it came out. I told him this is exactly how it came out since my mom never cutted into any of the meat, she used a fork to pick at the veggies. I didn't like how he insinuated that she had cut and ate into it already. She was eating the veggies cause she was hungry and it took him over 5 minutes to come over. My mom didn't want any trouble so she said it was fine and continued eating.  When she began eating the steak she said it tasted more like lamb than beef and I insisted it might just be the seasoning. She didnt want it anymore and was picking at the veggies only.  So I tried it and agreed it tasted like lamb. I asked the waitress to return it. The bill came and it wasn't taken off. The waitress said she would go ask another manager. David came and he did agree to take it off. He was much more pleasant to speak to and actually took the time to listen to our comments unlike the other manager. The waitress was wonderful and did whatever she could to make us happy.  In addition,  my husband didn't tell me until we got home that his steak tasted well done instead of medium like he ordered.  The outter layer was bitter due to being burnt.

Dropped the check when I said ""no thanks but may I go ahead and get a box?"".. instead he took my food and boxed it. I wasn't near done, I was simply trying to be proactive and just get a box since I knew I would need it with the portion sizes. When I got my change, he was literally waiting at the next table and right there when we got up.

So they were seated first and we were told that if we wanted a table it could be a very long time. We sqeezed uncomfortably into a booth.  One by one we excused ourselves to use the restroom and wash our hands. First, who has two stalls for a place that holds that many people. There was a line going out the door. Second the ladies room had not been attended to in a long time. One stall was out of toilet paper in the holders and the people were using a roll off the floor. In the second stall which I'll post a pic of, it was just about to be the same. All the trashcans were packed and overflowing. There were no papertowls to dry your hands... my dad came out and said that the mens room didn't have running water. He told a manager, but the manager could care less. So my dad had to eat with soap on his hands.  Things finally got better when our food came.

This recent experience was for my husband's birthday. Manny was our waiter - very well mannered and knowledgeable. My kiddo had a bacon hamburger with all the fixin's, my husband had tacos and I had the chicken and biscuits. My husband's meal was ok. He didn't get a choice of sides and it came with rice/beans. He did order a margarita and was very pleased by that. My son loved his hamburger and I was ultimately satisfied with my meal. We each took home a slice of cheesecake and spent about $100 on the whole meal. Seated immediately for a very early dinner (around 5pm) and spent about an hour there.

My family went in, asked for a table, NOT a booth for three. The people behind us came in with three as well and was given our table, because they write reservations as numbers not names. So they were seated first and we were told that if we wanted a table it could be a very long time. We sqeezed uncomfortably into a booth.  One by one we excused ourselves to use the restroom and wash our hands. First, who has two stalls for a place that holds that many people. There was a line going out the door. Second the ladies room had not been attended to in a long time. One stall was out of toilet paper in the holders and the people were using a roll off the floor. In the second stall which I'll post a pic of, it was just about to be the same. All the trashcans were packed and overflowing. There were no papertowls to dry your hands... my dad came out and said that the mens room didn't have running water. He told a manager, but the manager could care less. So my dad had to eat with soap on his hands.  Things finally got better when our food came. Mine was absolutely delicious (Eggplant Parmesan) mom liked her salad and dad said is Cuben was good but very dry.  Then came our cheesecakes. You can't go to the C heesecake Factory and not get cheesecake! They were amazing.

That said, there are still some problems that need to be addressed. One of which, being the price. It's a bit pricey, so don't be surprised when your check comes out to more than $60. Second, the parking space is just terrible. It definitely does not service the amount of people coming into Pf Changs AND The Cheesecake Factory.  However, there are some good things about the restaurant as well.  I highly suggest ordering off of the happy hour menu, because it has a decent selection of foods that will leave you more than full. Second, the service was pretty great. I felt like the staff was actually interested in what I had to say, and the staff was very helpful.  Finally, I must discuss the restroom situation. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory thinks that a dark closet with blaring music is the equivalent of a restroom. It is definitely not!

Just terrible.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3,2.56,2.74,2.968,,2.668
341,Austin T.,"Friendswood, United States",3,14,26.0,3.0,2018-10-01,"First off, I have to say that this is much better than the PF Changs across the parking lot. That said, there are still some problems that need to be addressed. One of which, being the price. It's a bit pricey, so don't be surprised when your check comes out to more than $60. Second, the parking space is just terrible. It definitely does not service the amount of people coming into Pf Changs AND The Cheesecake Factory.  However, there are some good things about the restaurant as well.  I highly suggest ordering off of the happy hour menu, because it has a decent selection of foods that will leave you more than full. Second, the service was pretty great. I felt like the staff was actually interested in what I had to say, and the staff was very helpful.  Finally, I must discuss the restroom situation. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory thinks that a dark closet with blaring music is the equivalent of a restroom. It is definitely not! After my trip to the lavatory, I realized this place was not as great as I had heard, but, I still recommend going here instead of going to PF Changs.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3,2.52,2.74,2.96,,2.652
