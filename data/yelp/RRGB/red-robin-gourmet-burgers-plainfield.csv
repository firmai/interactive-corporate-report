J B.,"Plainfield, IL",0,18,1,2.0,2/13/2016,Over the years service has gotten worse. Food quantity seems to be less for higher price. Takes forever for the kitchen to get out the orders.

Tom O.,"Lahaina, HI",0,8,1,2.0,5/16/2015,My chicken salad had cold chicken when it's usually at least warm. The salad was warm when it's usually cool.  The piece of bread on the side was cold and hard and the croutons were stale on the inside and mushy on the outside which means my salad was sitting in back for some time after it was prepared . It took forever to get my food. I was not alone as people around me were also asking what was taking so long. The overall dining experience was not good.  I live close so I come here more than I really want to just because it's close and it's not much better food or service than it was today. This place on its best day for me would barely get 3 stars. Every time I come here I wonder why why why I keep coming back. Chipotle is next door...next time...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20
Crystal T.,"Minooka, IL",11,9,11,2.0,11/6/2014,The best part of my meal was the drink! Could have picked any burger because it had no taste. Not impressed at all! Server Todd had zero people skills. I will never go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20

Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13,2.0,10/18/2012,"I'm a fan of the endless fries.  Hot, salty, endless fries - make sure you use some of that special seasoning!  I'm pretty sure it's just seasoned salt though. The burgers are good.  They aren't super greasy.  If you're a Meatheads or Five Guys fan, Red Robin probably isn't your thing. The service is bad though.  Every time we visit, my husband orders a burger & fries and a side salad.  They always forget the side salad.  Every stinking time.  First world problem, I know.  Prices are reasonable for a meal.  But the fountain drinks and lemonades (also endless!) are overpriced.  $4 for a strawberry lemonade?  We usually leave spending almost $40 on burgers and fries for each of us.  I feel like a fool sending that much at Red Robin, knowing I could've gotten a classier meal elsewhere. And there's usually a kid pitching a fit at the next table over.  Great for families, not so great for newlyweds that just want a burger.  I'll keep Red Robin in mind for when I have little brats to tote around and don't want to be embarassed in a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20
Michael T.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,6,,2.0,6/20/2016,"I stopped in today at 2:30 for a very late lunch.  The restaurant was not busy so I ate in the bar area and watched some soccer.  The food was good, but the service was the worse I have ever experienced at this Red Robin.  I asked for fries prior to my food so I could much on something while watching soccer.  The fried never came.  When my food did arrive, there were not as many fries as one would normal receive.  Secondly, the server (working behind the bar) disappeared for at least 15 or 20 minutes.  When she returned, I was finished eating and then she asked me if I wanted more fries.  I said yes.  Another 5 to 8 minutes passed and no fries.  So, I just got up to leave, asked for my check.  I will not go back there again.  Instead I will go to Nevins Brewery.  Similar food and definitely better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20
Deb M.,"Plainfield, IL",0,14,,1.0,8/12/2016,"I have had nothing but bad experiences lately with Red Robin. The last two times we have ordered a takeout order, we get it home and it is wrong.  I called them the first time and complained that they gave a burger w/ an egg on it instead of the Burning Love Burger.  The manager apologized and sent us a $15 gift card.  I ordered two burgers without mayo a couple weeks later and got home, and you guessed it, there was mayo on both!  I called the manager again.  I think he said he is the general mgr and that he is there because this Red Robin (in Plainfield, IL) has been having problems and he was wanting to get them back on track.  He apologized and said he would comp our meal and send out a gift card.  It has now been 3 weeks and nothing!  I called about 4 days ago and they said he would call me and I still have heard nothing.  Obviously, this general mgr doesn't care about his customers or helping the reputation of this particular Red Robin.  The Yelp reviews for the location are horrible and I can see why!!!  I will never order from this or any other Red Robin again!!!  Very very poor business!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20

Avni S.,"Naperville, IL",184,59,105,3.0,12/28/2011,"This is definitely a family restaurant.  Always noisy in the evening with kids and parents but we come here for the burgers!  The decor is very busy but nice to see different pictures and items on the wall at each location. The service is good.  Never had an issues dining in but carry out for large parties at a different location seem to be too complicated for them.  I prefer the Plainfield location but we don't do large orders out of this one.   I don't eat beef so I always opt for the turkey burger here with guacamole which is soooo yummy. But the burgers are huge for a single serving and I usually don't get the bottomless fries that each burger comes with.  I opt for the side salad with the poppy-seed dressing which I have become a fan of over several visits.   Thanksgiving brings out the gingerbread shake that is to die for so at least one visit for the gingerbread season for me!   I have to say I am disappointed they no longer have the salmon burger which, hands down, was always my favorite, but one by one the location stop serving it.  I always thought it was a healthier option and not as heavy as the turkey burger.  I am hoping they bring back soon!

It's a burger place and the burgers are dry? You have to keep asking for fries?  Just bring me a decent burger and a normal serving of fries from the start, how hard is that?   They were busy the weeknight we came in somehow , but still way to long a wait for service from waitstaff & very unorganized, they seemed very flustered and confused.  Our one waiter was nice though, maybe understaffed, because then we got a waitress, then him again ...& They ran out of fries? When you have unlimited fries as a main menu pull, not good to run out...I don't know.    Either way, even if service was good ,  both our burgers were bad, so we won't be back.

I have a big family, so the Red Robin Royalty card is a definite must have: Buy 9 burgers, get a 10th for free. Why 3 stars? Because service is hit or miss.

Shane S.,"Joliet, IL",51,21,2,1.0,1/30/2016,"There's nothing ""Gourmet"" about this place, but it IS for the birds.  I had an absolutely horrible experience here tonight. I brought my two young kids in for dinner at about 4:45pm. We were approached by the waiter fairly quickly for drinks, and got them quickly, but it went straight south from there. While placing our food order, he let me give him my kids' orders, but started grabbing the menus and walking away before I even gave him mine. After that it took over 30 minutes to get our food and it was anything but worth the wait. I had ordered two lime-style chicken breasts (forget the name) and a side salad. The chicken was room temperature and cut super thin, and the entire entreee was the size of an appetizer. The kids meals were likewise terrible with cold steamed broccoli and my daughter's pasta main dish was literally only three spoon fulls of food. Normally, in most restaurants, I have to push my kids hard to finish their plates. At this place, they not only finished them but both complained they were still hungry. I told the waiter that we got jipped on the pasta, and he said ""Yeah, I had noticed tgat."" Ummmm, but you served it to us anyway? Lackluster service, terrible wait, cold food, and underwhelming portion sizes. You're MUCH better off at Chilli's across the street, and that's saying a lot because I'm not a huge Chili's fan normally, but this place made Chilli's feel like a 4 star restaurant.

Joe V.,"Aurora, IL",1,24,,4.0,3/5/2015,"As always Red Robin is always a excellent place to go for burgers and reasonable price. Today I tried their new nacho Big Crunch burger and my gf got the California chicken. Both were cooked to asking and tasted delicious. We also ordered our usual chili chili con queso which is always a good choice. My only issue I've ever had with the location in Plainfield is that they remodeled the bar area to add more seating but at the expense of the customers table privacy and comfort. The new seating is awful! I'm literally elbow to elbow with a random stranger. Lol but because we love the burgers, our good server(Christine), and the polite hostess crowd, we make the trip out anyway.

Only when I got home did I realize that we had not paid for the meal! I called the restaurant and they appreciated me for calling back but said it's no big deal. I offered to give my credit card number over the phone but they refused to take it. I offered to come back to the restaurant and pay but they said that would not be necessary. Nevertheless, we went back to the restaurant and the staff and manager were so cool about it and in such good humor about the whole thing. I asked how much the check was for and the manager refused to tell me and said I don't need to worry about it. The waitress was also so cool about. I tipped the waitress and left.

Mike O.,"Aurora, IL",17,101,15,3.0,7/4/2016,"What makes Red Robin A-OK is the quality of their burgers and sandwiches.  It has been a year since I visited this location, and I was very disappointed.  Again, the quality of my favorite, The Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich was amazing.  Just as good as I ever tasted at any location.  Now, it comes to my chocolate shake, which has been always been brought to me in a glass, and the remainder in a stainless steel shaker left on the table. Voila!  Not any more. Now the shake comes in this thin cone shaped glass with barely enough chocolate shake to taste,  Not a DROP...NOT A DROP RICH AND CREAMY.  There is a hint of a chocolate shake there mired in whipped cream and sprinkles.  I do remember the waitress telling me that for a dollar more I could have the extra.  Previously, what was in the glass alone was substantial, rich and creamy ice cream.   Additionally, our waitress did not tell us that there would be a cost for substitutions to my fries and my better halves' fruit.  $ 1.49 extra for mine and .49 for her fruit.  Ticky tacky.  I usually tip 20%, so I gave her 15% instead.   I'll probably come back, the burgers and sandwiches are that good.  But no shakes.  There's more creaminess in a small Mickey D's shake than that ""froo froo"" shake here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield
John T.,"Romeoville, IL",0,4,,4.0,2/25/2017,"Finally returned to this location at the behest of my youngest kid, who still has good memories of the place, and was pleasantly surprised to see some improvements. I'm guessing they're due to regime change at the top, i.e. ownership or management. Lighting still kind of dim, and the Ziosk tablet kiosks still need to die, but staffing levels were better, service and speed were great, and the food order was correct!  Didn't need to ask for more bottomless fries or refills as service and fry portion size were notably improved. Food wasn't quite 'great' but definitely improved, so it gives me some hope that things are getting back on track.

Sabrina C.,"Batavia, IL",145,116,708,1.0,8/2/2013,"So, we eat here pretty frequently. We were literally one of the first loyalty club members. Kid loves it and I love that I can get a veggie burger. With bacon. With no judgment.  BUT.  Tonight we dined at this location after maybe a month or so. Menu had changed a bit, kid menu revamped, new plates vs flimsy baskets, etc. Seemed like a positive as we watched plate after plate being served, even if the plates seemed a bit small. Presentation says a lot, and the plates coming out looked nice.  And then... Our food arrived. My veggie burger was fine, same as usual - and I know Gardenburgers come frozen but it's worth it to me, so I don't care. My husband's fish and chips, however, were horrible. Like, I tried a bite and I can't get the taste out of my mouth terrible. Overcooked and the fish tasted frozen and smelled like it had been reheated. Overwhelmingly fishy smell (fresh fish, BTW, doesn't smell fishy.) Fortunately (?) the portion size was smaller than usual.  As for my daughter, well - I don't remember her corn dogs ever coming out with Foster Farms stamped all over the stick before. She thought it tasted ""different"" and ate maybe three bites. Total waste. And THEN, if that wasn't enough... they managed to CHANGE THE RANCH. My 5YO, who would bathe in Ranch if given the option, wouldn't even eat it. Husband and I tried it - watery and gross. Like they thinned it with milk and added oregano to cover up the thinned-out taste. Who messes up Ranch?? It didn't taste like this here a month ago. We were here at least once a week. I'm all for positive changes in a restaurant experience, but we didn't experience any positives. It just seems like they got cheap on their customers - without reflecting it in the prices. If I want a reheated frozen corndog, I'll go to Sam's Club. Finally, to add insult to injury - kid asks for a balloon on the way out, the hostess fills it and shoves it towards her hand without even acknowledging her so she could finish her conversation with the other hostess. We get outside, and the half-assed knot on the hastily filled balloon unraveled and the balloon went straight for the sky. We weren't two feet out the door. Talk about a sad kiddo.  This visit was poor enough that we likely won't return. I left one star because - well - Yelp makes me, and because our server (Katie) was great.

Susan F.,"Romeoville, IL",3,54,,1.0,12/29/2012,"Ok I know I said I wouldn't be going here again, but it has been over 4 years and you would think they got the picture from the bad reviews.  Hubby and I were in the area so we thought lets get a burger. The parking lot was very empty, it was a Thursday night, so that as I always say should have been a clue. There where only a few other couples there when they seated us in the bar area. It seemed fairly quiet.  We ordered the guac, salsa & chips for an appetizer. It came out with the tiniest amount of guac & salsa. My husband who loves salsa, took a couple of bites and was not impressed. I thought it tasted like caned tomatoes, yuck. The guac was so chunky it was basically a chopped up avocado. It came out on some sort of platform that we had trouble seeing and reaching into it. So I just took everything out of the platform and through it on the table. I just can't believe we paid $5 for this. At many restaurants we go to, the all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are free. Waitress never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, guess you don't get to choose any more. I asked for Provolone and was told later by the manager? that they were out. I ordered the steamed broccoli instead of the fries. It was OK, not as good as TGIFridays. The lettuce that came out on my open burger (which made it nearly impossible to put together) was shredded and tasted very bitter, old. My husband did get the fries and I glanced into his basket to see how many of the all-you-can-eat a total of about 5 fries was in the basket! Waitress never asked if he wanted any more. I usually steal one of his just for the taste, but for went this. The burger was dry and over cooked for my tastes. They never bused any of the tables even after the guests had left. They never picked up any of our dirty dishes when we were through. Then she asked if we wanted dessert and I thought your kidding right. Where would we be placing those dishes and I certainly don't want to eat a dessert with the lingering smells of my dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40
George W.,"Rochelle, IL",4,199,,5.0,10/5/2014,"For a burger place, this is as good as it gets.  We walked in, were seated by the hostess, got quick service, and boy, were the burgers good! We started with a short ""O tower"" which was around 6 onion rings, stacked in a tower that came with ranch and a smoke-infused barbeque sauce - perfect for 2 - some places drown you in onion rings - this was perfectly sized. The burgers came out next, and they were good.  Cooked to order, and you could actually taste what was on the burgers.  The bottomless fries were good as well. We had a great time with great service and great burgers.  Who needs stinkin wifi with food this good?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40
Robert R.,"Lemont, IL",140,205,64,4.0,5/10/2012,"OK, this one's gonna be short and sweet.  I've only been here twice, but liked my Guacamole burger enough the first time enough to order it again when I returned yesterday.   I like that they ask you how you want it cooked and both times it came out great.  They seemed to skimp a little on the fries yesterday, but I don't need to be eating them at all, so maybe they did me a favor.  Our server was very prompt, friendly and brought me a refill even before I really needed one.   If you like burgers, I think you'll like Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40
Angie M.,"Crest Hill, IL",89,33,,2.0,3/18/2014,"We are big fans of Red Robin and usually have a great experience. This last visit was a bit underwhelming. We were one of the first ones in the restaurant and yet our appetizer- chili cheese fries- took forever and then came out 2 minutes before our food. Not sure whose fault that was, our servers or the kitchens. Our server may have been new because she wasn't on her A-game at all. I had to ask for napkins several times, and everything seemed to take extra long even though we were one of 3 tables in the restaurant. Also, our burgers were overcooked. We asked for some pink and they wasn't a trace of pink in either of our burgers.  Also, the prices seem to be going up, but the portions get smaller. And what's the deal with getting rid of Kids cups? The lids for the cups you have now are NOT kid friendly in the least bit. If you charge $10-$14 for a burger, than as a company, you should surely be able to afford to have kids cups in your restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40
Ali H.,"Naperville, IL",0,16,9,2.0,3/25/2015,Food was unbelievable salty. Had the wings SALTY!!. Wife said her dish was salty. The only one that enjoyed there meal was my 5 year old girl. Got flat drinks(coke) took 15 min to swap them out. Ordered a soup and asked for it bought out first thing- after 90% of the meal was finished the soup came and that was after two different people asked me a few times asking if i got my soup. I have been here a bunch of times but never took this long to get my food and tasted like swallowing a salt bucket.

Anthony R.,"Lockport, IL",0,4,,2.0,10/5/2015,This location has slow service.

Michael D.,"Romeoville, IL",34,29,13,4.0,3/25/2012,"A little research on their fun interactive nutrition info page on there website and I was ready to go with a solid idea of how many carbs I could expect to consume for dinner. More restaurants could take their queues from RR. Very handy. We ended up with a party of 7 for an after school function on a Sunday at about 5:30. I figured we would have trouble getting seated immediately, but I was wrong. We were seated and greeted quickly. Our server Dawn did not bat an eye when we said we would need three separate checks. Score on in RR favor. No problem taking my low carb order either. Food came out relatively quickly. Everything was delicious. They did bring one of our group a chicken sandwich instead of the salad she thought she ordered, but that was fixed quickly and one of the cooks delivered it from the kitchen himself. Matt, the manager made a quick stop at the table and  said to call him if anything was not to our liking. Everything was and everyone enjoyed themselves. The only issue i have ever had with RR is the noise level. The music can be loud and there is always at least one screaming child in the place. The burgers are so good though!

I'm shocked by the other reviewers complaints about the service.  I've been here several times for work parties, nights out, lunch with friends and the service has always been great.   Yes the fries are bottomless but not so great.  Most of the burgers are pretty good with one stand out: the Bleu Ribbon Burger.  The combo of the steak sauce and the bleu cheese is heavenly and topped with crispy onion straws, tomatoes and zesty chipotle mayo on an onion bun.  Ask if you can swap out for the jalapeno kaiser roll for an added kick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40
Linwood J.,"Plainfield, IL",95,4,1,4.0,10/20/2011,"Fun place with good food. All of their food is very tasty and service is normally very good. I eat here a couple of times a quarter.  Sometimes I'll go here for a quick business lunch or even alone (their take out service is very fast and convenient).  I will also go here with the kids sometimes and they always enjoy the food here. It can be a little pricey once your ""kids"" stop ordering from the kids menu. So be mindful of that before you go. Another plus is that you get free steak fries for your appetizer. I'm not a fan of their desserts so I don't get dessert here (and I'm a dessert fan, so that says something).  The only other draw back is there isn't much light on the menu here for those who carefully watch what you eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40

After having my baby and bringing her here, I realize that I like this restaurant even more.  I am beginning to see why kids like it here so much.  The decor and menu are child-friendly, with crayons and a pad to draw on in the beginning, and a cute reusable straw cup filled with whatever they like to drink.  We also get balloons! I think... if their food is good to both my husband and I, my kid happily eats and she is easily entertained, then the place deserves 5 stars.  Bravo! Desserts are flavorful, yet average.  I say this because it's the norm-type sweets: ice cream ala mode-ish, brownies, pie, cake, etc.  You know, stuff kids LOVE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40

James D.,"Newark, DE",2,6,,3.0,4/10/2009,"Red Robin is a large chain that I had the opportunity to try for the first time on a business trip to California over 10 years ago.  The difference between then and the now in the Midwest is that the quality is slightly lower and the service is spotty at best.  The burgers are good and if you've got hungry teenagers, the bottomless fries are a great deal.  We usually get the burgers or chicken sandwich and they are always fine and very filling.  It's probably not the best burger around but it's very consistent and a great place to bring kids or a loud group.  The level of help is probably the only concern I have but that's consistent with most of the chain restaurants in the area.  Keep your expectations moderate and you will enjoy this food as much as any other chain in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=60
