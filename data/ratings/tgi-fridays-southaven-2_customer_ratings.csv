19,Mark D.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",23,5,1.0,2.0,2014-08-13,"We have not eaten here in months. The place was dead. Service was good, but the food was ok at best. Order balsamic chicken salad, was supposed to come with romaine lettuce, they served it with iceberg. Then the kitchen manager denied it was wrong. Saying there romaine lettuce isn't as dark as most lettuce. I felt he was rude. With a place with no customers chasing away people with bad food doesn't say much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
15,Aaron C.,"Memphis, TN",34,24,4.0,1.0,2015-04-12,"If I'm being honest, if I could give this place zero stars, I would. I went in with my family Saturday night. The place wasn't very busy, which should have been my first clue. But we ignored it. I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta and it was horrible, very bland. My mother ordered steak and lobster and vomited after the first bite of steak. The salads aren't really tossed salads, as the menu says. It may not be a big deal, but you want what you pay for. The only thing that was worth the trip to TGIFridays was the bacon macncheese bites and dessert. All in all, it was a bad experience and will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
16,Elvis G.,"Plaza Primera, FL",0,6,15.0,1.0,2015-04-13,The service is slow and we are in a calm time of the day !! I don't want to be here in a busy time !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
17,Nick W.,"Memphis, TN",157,89,49.0,4.0,2015-05-25,"I absolutely love the food at TGI Friday's (any and every location). This location has actually gone down a little in quality over the past 5 years or so, but it's still good. You just can't beat some Jack Daniel's sauce on a burger, chicken, or steak. The bar area is pretty nice, and it's usually not too busy so you don't have to wait long for drinks. Good spot to go for some good food and drinks during a game. I recommend signing up for their rewards program and earning some free food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
18,Taurin H.,"Memphis, TN",222,5,6.0,2.0,2015-07-24,Maybe it's just today but the service is horrible. I could see if it were crowded but it's empty. I'm with a group of 9 and I had to go the bar to get my own drink because the waitress was inattentive to our table. We inky got service when we requested for a manager. This might be a good Fridays any other day but not today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
5,Frank C.,"Memphis, TN",42,135,436.0,3.0,2015-08-13,"Good place for a quick, iinexpensive meal. In fact, with their unlimited appetizers for $10 deal, two people can eat for $5 each!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
7,Camille W.,"Memphis, TN",76,335,563.0,4.0,2015-08-26,The food was good and hot the drinks were on point nice and smooth plus on Wednesday nights they have karaoke from 9-1am food and entertainment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
21,Coty W.,"Southaven, MS",0,3,,1.0,2015-10-09,"Well my friend and I decided to go to TGI Friday's because we bought tickets to see a movie and wanted drinks before we went. Our waitress was horrible. We waited for 20 minutes for our first round of drinks to come to our table. Mind you, the place wasn't busy at all. We ordered our food and after waiting for another 45 minutes and the table next to us was already waited on and they were on their 3 round of drinks. I asked to speak to a manager and you best believe after I asked for a manager our food came right along. I asked about a discount because I heard it was a policy restaurant give a discount if your food is longer than 30 minutes to get you and my waitress said no because our food was under the light for 5 minutes. So then why did it take 45 minutes to get to us? Long story short I am one pissed off customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2?start=20,,,,,
13,Andrea H.,"Horn Lake, MS",47,1,,1.0,2015-12-22,"This location is by far the worse I have been to. I have had 4 bad experiences with inaccuracies in my order, to cold food, to  even waiting 45 minutes for food on a very slow night. The management doesn't care and I will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
12,Annie M.,"Spring, TX",31,3,,3.0,2015-12-29,"Friendly staff. Wait was a bit long after ordering. Food was ok but nothing to brag about. Floor smelled very rotten, as if mopped with an extremely soured mop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
22,Royce A.,"Moscow, TN",0,8,,1.0,2016-02-17,"TGI Fridays, 176 Goodman Rd. E., Southaven, Ms., 38671. On 02/16/2016 around 2:45 pm my wife and I thought we would grab a late lunch, when we entered, the bar was full and the dining area was a mere handful, so we sat down and ordered, I went to the restroom to wash my hands, the restroom could have used a freshening up and the soap dispenser was empty, my wife said that the women's restroom had paper strewn everywhere. Our appetizer came in about 15 minutes, a tasteless mozzarella spinach dip, about 40 minutes later our entree' came, a simple dish that should have been prepared in about fifteen minutes, three well done sliders with barbecue sauce and grilled chicken salad with pecans and cranberries. We got three sliders that were burnt completely black with dill pickles and a salad with no pecans, no cranberries, fresh lettuce mixed with older half dead lettuce and some rank cheese that left a bitter taste in our mouth. The fresh lettuce when you separate it from the old and the grilled chicken was the only thing edible at our table. A table of 6 came in about 20 minutes after my wife and I, and were served 5 minutes after we were served with so much food they needed 3 waiters to bring all of the platters. I guess you better know someone at this place or you may regret coming here. The waiter was nice so we left a gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2?start=20,,,,,

It's not busy either so what're they doing? I'm hungry, I want to leave but I've waited this long. Now I'm going to sit and stare at the dirty floor, please spot sweep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,

14,Donald A.,"Southaven, MS",0,9,16.0,2.0,2016-08-29,"Girlfriend and I arrived about 6pm hoping for a nice quick but relaxing dinner. Not many people were inside and they sat us in the bar area. Immediately noticed the music??? was way to loud. Asked the waitress if they could turn it down,  sheepishly she said it would be better if we moved. (She was fantastic by the way, only reason why they're getting more than one star) So moved us to the other side of the bar and I swear they turned the music up! Asked the waitress to tell the manager we came here to eat not dance at the club. Didn't matter still too loud, not coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
11,Violet M.,"Horn Lake, MS",0,41,3.0,1.0,2016-10-14,This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. My husband and I love to sit at the bar but this time was horrible. The staff and manager included were acting like a bunch of drunk patrons. They were extremely loud I felt like we were at a football game. They were drinking on tha job and horse playing. We were totally ignored I had to yell for them to get their attention and ask for a refill after sitting there for 15 minutes with nothing to drink. We needed ranch and mustard with our meals and again I had to yell and get their attention to get these items. The manager was constantly being inappropriate with female coworkers he was rubbing his head between one ladies breasts and hunching another from behind. It was very unprofessional. If this was just customers it would be no big deal but this was a manager and staff members.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
6,Jennifer H.,"La Mesa, CA",4,36,21.0,2.0,2016-11-10,"I placed an order online and arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later only to be told that there was ""confusion"" when the online order popped up and it was therefore never made. I then had to sit and wait for my order to be prepared. I should have trusted the previous yelp reviewers passed on this place. Lesson",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
8,Trevor R.,"Cordova, TN",167,1,,5.0,2016-12-28,Starting my new position here as bar manager. I know in the past this location has had its ups and downs. But I'm here to try and get the family of employees as strong as can be so that we can deliver the best corner bar experience out there. This bar has so much potential and I would like to invite everyone to our new beginning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
2,Kirstin S.,"Riverside, CA",193,55,,1.0,2017-01-05,"Had a very strange experience here. First of all, I will confirm that the staff was more concerned with playing grab ass with each other than they were in helping wait tables.  The service was slow, and then when we got food delivered, they only brought my boyfriend's food.  There'd apparently been an issue with mine, and it was sent back.  His food was already cold when it showed up.  Then they brought mine after another 10-15 minutes. Here's the weird part.  The restaurant was well staffed, and busy, but not full.  There were 3 tables in our section (with room for probably 12-15 more tables).  The rest of the restaurant was substantially more full.  But the whole section up front where we were seated was white people, and everyone else was black.  So we got terrible service, because they're segregating the restaurant? I spoke with two coworkers who confirmed that they had experienced the same thing with their wives.  Really bizarre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
4,Jordan J.,"Horn Lake, MS",1,5,,5.0,2017-03-02,This place is wonderful highly suggested wish my stomach was bigger. Food =heaven.

3,Sujeil B.,"Dublin, OH",34,6,27.0,1.0,2017-03-19,"My recommendation, don't come here. The place was really dirty . The food is bad and cold. We also need to wait 50 min for our food. The waitress was so kind and try to explain that there is no Sprite, no spinach dip, and no strawberry lemonade.Really! This is a restaurant and they supposed to have what they put on the menu. I give her a ten working in a place dirty, and miss lot of things. Give this place a 1 for mercy.Please, take care of your business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
0,Tiffany B.,"Memphis, TN",13,83,117.0,5.0,2017-06-27,I love this place. Food and service is always good. The staff is friendly and they know their menu. The managers as well as the bartenders are great. I definitely will keep coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
1,Rachelle H.,"Norman, OK",26,1,2.0,2.0,2017-11-25,"Probably my worst restaurant experience in months. The potato skins were just the potatoes with craft singles and bacon on top (it's supposed to be cheddar cheese, green onions and bacon). The sizzling chicken and cheese was also kraft singles and wasn't even fully melted. The chicken itself wasn't bad (neither were the mashed potatoes it came with) but i would never recommend this TGI Friday's location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southaven-2,,,,,
