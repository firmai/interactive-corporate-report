17,Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",124,200,33.0,3.0,2012-02-13,"Service was alright until we sat too long, and she obviously wanted us to leave. I guess this is in Chili's training now since I have experienced it at the last few I have been to. The food was the same as usual, which is good but nothing to brag on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
15,Todd W.,"Dallas, TX",222,233,238.0,3.0,2012-05-31,Good place for a family meal. nothing special. service has gotten better. but the food tastes the same as it always has. at least they are consistent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
12,Meg C.,"McKinney, TX",112,173,341.0,4.0,2013-04-03,This location does the Chili's brand proud. I really suggest getting on their mailing list for the weekly coupons.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
11,Jennifer T.,"San Antonio, TX",563,132,80.0,2.0,2014-07-25,"Until this visit I hadn't been to Chili's in about 7 years and now I remember my absence was for good reason.  The service was lackluster with the waiter disappearing for long periods of time when we needed him (i.e. after our food came out we needed additional condiments and after 5 minutes of him not checking on us we flagged down a manager to get what we needed).  My food, while presented nicely, was barely warm but my mother's was hot.  Seems as though they made mine first and then it sat and got cold while they made hers.  I prefer local businesses/restaurants, but got talked into this chain for this particular meal...lesson learned...again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
16,Mary Z.,"Granbury, TX",0,2,,4.0,2014-10-13,"I just moved here about 3 months ago. Visited Chili's a couple of days ago. Was a little hesitant because I went with someone that has lived here for like 30 years and they told me that it was horrible. I told them that every time I've driven by, it's always packed. We decided to try it since it had been several years since my friend had eaten there. We got there around 5 pm and were seated immediately. I ordered a the tall beer and it was cold and brought quickly. I ordered the crispy chicken tacos with a side of rice and black beans that came with it. It was really tasty. Our waiter was friendly enough. I don't think we were checked on too much, but sometimes that can be a little annoying anyway. I did like the new Kiosks they had at each table that allowed you to view the menu, drinks, desserts and even pay your check by sliding your card on the side. It allowed you to pay the whole check, or split 2 or 3 ways evenly. I wish that it allowed each guest to pay their own check according to what they ordered but that wasn't available.  All in all it was a good visit and I would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
8,Diane H.,"Granbury, TX",17,14,12.0,4.0,2015-05-07,Chili's is always great  We had the Watermelon Margarita.  Fresh Mex bowls are very tasty.  My favorite thing is the Southwest Egg Rolls.  The Table Side Guacamole is prepared fresh at your table  you can't beat that.  The service is friendly and prompt.  Great for groups or couples  TVs set all around are great for watching sports,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
13,Carla L.,"Weatherford, TX",0,33,,5.0,2015-10-09,Ask for Ryan! Excellent server.  Our food was only stood up by the service. We had triple dipper and a salad. Everything was cooked very well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
1,Eric W.,"Tarrant, TX",465,1198,4385.0,3.0,2016-01-20,"So Chili's would not typically be my first choice when deciding on a place to eat, but I received some gift cards and decided to use them. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm trying to eat healthier these days, and was pleased to see that Chili's has a ""Lighter Choices"" section on their menu (   ). The section reads, ""All of the flavor for less than 600 calories."" I've tried the ""Ancho Salmon"", ""Margarita Grilled Chicken"", ""Mango-Chile Tilapia"", and the ""Mango-Chile Chicken.""All are perfectly serviceable. The portion of vegetable, sometimes steamed broccoli, was generous, and it was not over cooked. In fact, one time, it was a little under, which is OK by me. Sometime the vegetable is ""citrus-chile rice"" and it's OK too, though often a bit over-cooked.  One complaint I do have is that Chili's only has Tabasco hot sauce (at least here in Texas). I would much prefer Cholula hot sauce (or similar), as I think it is not as sour (vinegar) as Tabasco.  My other complaint, and this goes for both the Chili's I have visited recently, is they are rather loud. The general din of the place is loud, which makes almost everyone in the place talk louder. Also, Chili's seems to be popular with ""the younger crowd"", who also seem to be louder.  Other than that, service has been generally good, though several times we did things (re-order drinks, pay) via the Ziosk's tablet-based ordering system (which worked surprisingly well). But watch out for this thing, as some content (games) is going to cost you extra... But hey, if it keeps the kids quite, it's worth it (as the guy at the next table). Note, if you do get dinged for a tablet charge, complain and most likely they will take the charge off your bill.  Bottom line: Not my first choice, but not ruled out (anymore) either. It is indeed, A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
10,Laura H.,"Granbury, TX",0,12,,1.0,2016-04-25,"I don't care for Chilis.  Everything tastes like it came frozen from a bag.  The ONLY reason I went there was for the advertised $10.99 1/2 rack ribs, with French fries, salad and molten lava cake.  First - we get there and notice the special isn't advertised on the menu so we ask our inept waiter about it and he says ""Yeah, we ran out of cake so we removed the inserts from the menu"".  I notice there are other desserts priced the same as the cake and ask about it but am told no substitutions.  So we ordered a full rack of ribs (to share), substituted the broccoli for a side salad and ordered an additional side salad (which according to the menu when ordered with an entrée should have been 2.99 we were charged 3.79.  We sat there for about 35-40 minutes with nothing more than a half full glass of tea, when finally we see our waiter and ask him about the salads.  He says ""Oh, you want your salads now, I'll go get them"" then comes back with everything, salad, entrée, everything.  Never does offer any more tea.  This place sucks, the food sucks and the service sucks.  Never again Chilis, never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
9,Tom M.,"Mesquite, TX",0,11,,2.0,2016-08-14,"Normally spot on for what I look for, great service, outside of 1 server which I will leave if he is my server.  But I usually sit at the bar and enjoy my time there with good food.  The kitchen continues to go down hill.  12 minutes after my food was rung in the manager on duty came and told me they couldn't make the order because it was still frozen.  This was about the time I was expecting my order.  No apologies from the manager, he started off by saying ""I have some bad news"".  He implied that whatever else I ordered would come out quickly.  Well 22 minutes after I ordered it came out.  And this was a sandwich!!!   This tells me the kitchen is ok with not starting an order until at least 12 to 15 minutes after it is placed.   Go here for a good time at the bar with great bartenders.  Anything other than that go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
6,Daniel B.,"Granbury, TX",1,30,11.0,1.0,2016-08-18,"It seems to me that this location must have an unspoken rule that if people come in with small kids, they must wait at least an hour to get food. This happens on more than 1 occasion at this location. The food when it finally arrived was room temp. My wifes had ordered pork tacos and got beef tacos, but after an hour we just eat and split. I think the bill with gratuity suggestions starting at 15% is laughable. If I was alone and not with my family he would have got a big fat donut on the tip line. I ordered the triple dipper which had obviously been changed since our last visit. The pathetic dish came out and looked like they had scraped leftovers off some other plates and then sent it out to me. Chili's is absolutely horrible lately. If they keep this up I would hope that the drop in customers would prompt them to change back to better portions and service and not the feeble attempt at the plate they delivered to the table an hour after we ordered. Last note don't serve stale chips with the salsa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
3,Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",29,250,11.0,2.0,2016-09-26,"I will make this clear, Chili's is NOT my place of choice when deciding where to eat, there are far better restaurants in the world (and area) that serve more quality food for the price. The unfortunate reason we decided to stop here was because we had a big group, we are not from the area, my cousin for an unknown reason loves Chili's, and it was the closest thing there was with no wait for 8. Our server comes around and asks my husband what he wanted to drink, my husband trying to hear the conversation the table is having and trying to figure out what he wanted to order, let's our server know not to start with him, to which our server replies ""Don't you know what you want to drink?"" WELL. I let our server know I will have the strawberry margarita, no salt, no sugar, and would like that frozen, which he then replies ""I need to see your ID"" Okay, no problem I look younger than my 24 years of age. After looking at my ID and looking at me for what seems like 10 minutes, he finally hands it back and get's my husband's drink order. My husband, bless his friendly heart, hands the server his ID to which the server replies, ""No that's alright you're good!"" .... Excuse me? Now, I just discovered this is a pet peeve of mine so here's my wrath. My husband is 6 months older than me, and yet I get carded. I find it extremely sexist that because the server assumes I'm younger than 21 he will card me and not my husband just because he has facial hair. I've worked in the service industry, you card everyone who looks under the age of 40 or don't card anyone at all. Bless your heart kid. Anyways, the food was meh. My mother and aunt ended up returning their dish because their food was ice cold. Everything else was fine. Chili's never fails to remind me why I don't like eating there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
4,Shane S.,"Granbury, TX",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-01-31,I would not even give them a one star go there have a dirty table and they acted mad about wiping it off and then they get the hole meal ready then comes over to my wife and says they don't have what she ordered so it is not very good service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
7,Rusty S.,"Watford City, ND",0,33,,1.0,2017-03-04,I love chilis but this chilis here in granbury has serious service issues every time my wife and I come here we have to sit and wait up front for 10-12 minutes to wait to be seated at lunch or at dinner time and this is just us two alone standing there it's not crowded at all finally a host shows up to seat us and then the waiter comes they bring your drink and no refills you don't see them again until your food comes out and then you have to hunt them down for drink refills it's ridiculous if you hate your job quit and get another the management here is extremely lacking need to get on top of this service issue NOW,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
5,Rebecca N.,"Granbury, TX",35,12,2.0,3.0,2017-06-14,This is my second review of this place. I gave two more stars. This time I went with a coworker at lunchtime. We got pretty good service until the end of our meal when I paid cash for my ticket instead of using a card. I actually had to hold up the money ($20 for a $12 ticket) and ticket on the server's third trip by our table and ask her to please take care of it. She snapped at me that it would be a minute and grabbed it out of my hand. Then she came back shortly and slapped my change on the table and walked off. Said absolutely nothing. Nothing. Since I used to be in the service industry I have to wonder if she thought I was going to leave her an $8 tip on a $12 check. I tip above average and would have actually left her the five because her service and friendliness was a pleasant surprise from my last experience. Instead I let my coworker's tip stand for the table. Too bad because she was great until then and my food was mediocre as usual. For God's sake put some liquid in those au gratin potatoes that y'all call potato soup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
2,Dameon H.,"Granbury, TX",53,14,4.0,5.0,2017-06-23,"Well they've done better than where they were last time we ate there. Food was good and not salty like last time. The menu has gotten larger as well. Overall the visit this time was by far better than last time. As D is a veteran his meal was free, but better was an employee that came along thanking all",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
0,Tammy S.,"Granbury, TX",2,8,,5.0,2017-08-25,"Chillis is your average ""high quality"" microwaveable food but the service will leave you flabergasted!! Ryan who usually bartends will blow your moldy socks off!! He goes above and beyond and will tend to your every need. I definitely give this a knee slapping rating!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-granbury,,,,,
