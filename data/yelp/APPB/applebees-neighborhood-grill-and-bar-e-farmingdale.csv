Jim D.,"Queens, NY",356,421,7538,4.0,10/27/2017,"Well Hey there Friends! .. How is Everyone doing on this Beautiful Week ending Friday?   Applebee's is one of those chain joints, like Friday's & Buffalo Wild Wings and Outback. All are a bit similar, but offer different experiences. I do not recommend going with any of these establishments during busy times. At times of lighter traffic, however they can be in ideal choice. I was very pleased with my visit this evening at Farmingdale's Applebee's, went with my friend and we sat at the bar. Thursday Night Football and Hockey were the events of the evening. For dinner, we decided to try the Applebees 2 for $20. This turned out to be a very good choicefor us. This meal can be upgraded for $3 extra to include spare ribs, which I did. All together, with the onion ring appetizer mac and cheese and baked potato/ bacon. I had a heck of a meal for 13 bucks.  Service was very fast. I never go to places like this when it's busy. My beer was cold and crisp and a chilled Pilsner. My spare rib and mac and cheese dinner with baked potato arrived in about 10 minutes. First up however were the onion rings, they came to the table in less than 5 minutes. The beer battered rings hot and crisp, quite good. My friends chicken tenders with fries were the average meal nothing to Crow about, but it's what he liked.   Our barmaid was very friendly and engaging. I like the way that this Applebee's has a HomeTown flavor to it, the decorations and interior appointments were really interesting and fun to look at. The wall scenes were personalized and customized with photos of the local school teams and familiar attractions in the local area. It certainly makes it more like you're at home when you're surrounded with the sites that you grew up with. I found this Applebee's a very nice cozy place to relax and enjoy the game and time with friends I was very pleased before our visit here and certainly will return again. Budget-wise, it was a little less than I spend at some other places. I'll be sure to return. JIM D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale

Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",62,426,1257,3.0,8/27/2017,"This was the second time I have ever gone to an Applebee's. The restaurant was somewhat busy and the service was very attentive. Once again, our young guest dove into corn dogs while we shared a chicken salad. What I found interesting was that the restaurant had local school pictures of either sporting events or general events such as Hofstra, Plainview and Amityville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Danielle R.,"Massapequa Park, NY",29,7,,1.0,11/8/2017,"I wouldn't advise you to go to here but if you do keep track of your receipts..i came here on Halloween with my family (6 total) it was busy so i can understand long wait for food, or drinks, even the dirty silverware we received..but when 1 of the 6 meals failed to even come out of the kitchen and our waiter; Mannie or Manny however the unbelievable horrific waiter spells it, was no where to be seen, everyone else was almost done eating when we FINALLY flagged him done, the so very rude waiter turns and snaps at us saying well why did you wait so long??! Are you kidding me, he then as flamboyantly as possible turns and throws his hands up we then dealt with the manager Jillian who was  Apologetic and all and almost excused his bad behavior because ""they were slammed that night"". We as a group decided NO tip seemed appropriate since he failed to be our waiter, at best he took the order AND THATS it, and even that he didn't do that correctly my food came out wrong. My sister just received her cc statement and it seems as though the horrific waiter decided to change the receipt and tip himself..The police will be called on this thief. Diners beware!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Joe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,25,10,2.0,7/22/2017,This has nothing to do with the food because it's Applebees and you know what you are going to get. This is about their dinner and a movie offer for 9 dollars at the movie theater across the road. Apparently you have to eat at Applebee's first to buy the tickets. But if you want to reserve your seats like we did you buy your tickets to get the best seats available. I feel like we got ripped off here because we were trying to save our seats. They need a better system like refunding the difference. Not fair!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Mike A.,"Hicksville, NY",0,40,1,1.0,6/20/2016,"I ordered the whiskey chicken with mashed potatoes. It didn't come with the advertised gravy. The chicken was dry and bland.

Evelyn I.,"Amityville, NY",47,9,,3.0,12/27/2016,I went here for my little sisters birthday since she loves Applebee's and we just wanted to do something special for her. It was a big party. It was a party of 15. Wait time was pretty long took about an hour to sit us down. But the people who sat us down i don't know what their problem was but they kept giving us nasty attitudes. So we got our table but the good thing was The waitress we had was really nice. She did really well with our kids. And with the older people too. She was and enjoyment and brought us our food pretty quickly. Food tasted really good. It was well made. Bathrooms were ok.

He ordered the boneless chicken wings and he bit into one that was ice cold. When he cut it open it was completely RAW.   He showed it to his server and he was told ...""So what the hell do you want me to do about it""  My son was in shock, that this is the way he was being treated. He never got the servers name but he was bald with a beard and on the shorter side.  A few hours after he got home, he became very ill and threw up for hours. He was sick with food poisoning.

Philip C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",27,25,8,5.0,2/14/2016,Nothing much to be expected from an Applebee's. Pretty my the same as all the others. Prices are fair and can be cheap by ordering the two for deals. The food is alright but for these type of chains aren't bad.

Marc'Violet P.,"Wyandanch, NY",0,9,5,5.0,11/20/2016,"Much better than the one near the mall. Food is always fresh. Service great.

Michelle L.,"Levittown, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/4/2017,"I went in to the Applebee's located in airport plaza tonight 3/4/17 after a movie at around ~10:20 pm. I am aware that it is half off apps and often hectic but, upon my arrivial I was greeted at the hostess stand by the manager, Starr, she was INCREDIBLY rude to me. After taking my name (with an attitude) she then proceeded to run over and yell at her waitresses in front of her waiting guests. I understand she may have been stressed however, she is the MANAGER not a hostess and one would think she knows the importance of keeping a calm demeanor in the presence of her guests. I then watched her yell to the other patrons in an unprofessional manner that their table was ready.  She is in the FRONT OF THE HOUSE position on a busy Saturday night when there are other various options all over RT 110 offering similar late night meal options. I will not return to this establishment and hope others will choose elsewhere as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Kelli S.,"West Babylon, NY",172,43,4,2.0,12/28/2015,"Went for my birthday with a small group of people. The food and drinks were good but the service was horrendous. Our waiter, nick, didn't come to check up on us at all. We found ourselves waiting for refills and more food but no waiter in sight (keep in mind it wasn't that busy). Then they told him it was my birthday when it turned midnight and ordered some churros. He did not say happy birthday and also didn't take it upon himself to gather the crew to come out and sing. We grabbed a different waiter, Shamus, who my brother asked to get people to sing and he promised they would come right out and he too failed to make it happen. Extremely rude thing to do on someone's birthday, no matter how much we all hate being sang to at a restaurant, it's part of the gig. I'll be going to other local Applebee's where they are more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Beena P.,"Roslyn, NY",1,31,13,2.0,7/1/2015,"I'm going to keep it pretty simple. What I hate about this applebees?

Jo B.,"Melville, NY",4,19,2,1.0,9/7/2015,"I went for a birthday dinner for my fiancé and his work friends in hopes we could have a few quick drinks and a bite to eat before swinging by Main Street to continue the festivities. Boy, was I wrong! I've been to this Applebees during the work week and we had prompt service. I guess that only applies to Monday-Friday for the lunch crowd. We checked in for a table for seven people and had to wait a few minutes for the table to cleared to eat. It was 9 pm at this point and the restaurant was pretty quiet so I wasn't really annoyed. As we waited for our party to join us, the server made a few passes to make refills of sugar packets and new ketchup. She seemed like she was impatient to get us started. As everyone showed up and people started deciding on their alcoholic beverage of choice, she seemed to nearly question whether someone of age was in the party. I ordered a margarita which came with an olive in the glass and was tinted green in color. I barely finished one glass but I was expecting something better than I was expecting. This particular waitress apparently had an issue handling a large table and gave us an attitude  before passing us off to another waitress who had way too many tables. I'm not blaming our second waitress as she was covering too much space to be effective. Our table wasn't cleared after dessert was brought out and it was littered with glasses and plates making it ineffective to eat off. At some point, the bartender had to bring our second round out because our waitress couldn't keep up. I ate so little because I was turned off by the service and wasn't sure if I was actually going to have any food. It took us 45 minutes to get the check split up and paid for and we had to give it to another server because she literally vanished. All in all, I didn't get to visit Main Street because a little over 2 hours for some apps, drinks and dessert was a little much. I'm not going to be coming back to this place after that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale
Michael W.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,9,,1.0,7/11/2016,Went with a colleague for lunch.  Walked through the door and it wasn't exceptionally busy.  Three separate employees looked at us from across the room but didn't greet us or seat us.

They were frozen ice cream type cakes, so what could go wrong? The staff serving really tries and is nice enough. Good tea. Again. What can go wrong?

January D.,"Long Island, NY",0,9,,1.0,6/2/2015,"Never again.  Worst burger ever.  They left the bacon & the pickles off & gave me charred, burned pieces of onion.  It sucked.  The other sandwich in the order was missing  pulled pork, which is basically the main meat of the sandwich. I called to speak to the manager & he had the audacity to laugh when I asked for a credit. He should've offered it.  What a disgusting experience. I will never go to this or probably any other Applebee's after this.  I think their days are numbered, if this is how they conduct business.  They suck!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=20
Kenya F.,"Massapequa, NY",17,31,118,1.0,4/10/2015,"Came here tonight at 10 for half off apps. There was traffic by the greeter booth and a lot of noise, the greeter asked for my name and how many I told him Kenya and 2. As I'm sitting waiting I noticed people who came after me were already being seated. So I approached the greeter's booth and asked him if he had my name correctly, he said no there's no Kenya here and just shook his head after I waited 25 minutes. This is ridiculous.. you don't shake your head in agreement as if you got my name and everything is good but don't even have my name on the list. I told him I've been waiting for 25 minutes already and he said ""well you're going to have wait longer now, about another 15 minutes "" which is complete BS when five people who came after me were already seated.

Matthew R.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",46,364,4,3.0,5/6/2014,"Your typical Applebee's. Place is kept clean, service was good, and the food was what you expected. One surprise was the portabello mushroom that came with the steak. It was great. I ordered the steak medium rare and that's what I got. The wedge salad could have had a bit more dressing on it.

Jay P.,"West Babylon, NY",1,17,18,1.0,1/19/2014,"This Applebee's maybe in a some what nice area sort of speak... This was my 2nd time coming here. The 1st time I had a bad experience food tasted old and the service wasn't pleasant. This time I decided to give it one more chance. The wings were over fried and black looking (felt like biting into pork rinds), the black n blue burger (was supposed to be well done) came back bloody, most the French fries were the hard over fried bottom of the fryer fries, the chicken tenders for my child were 90% extra hard breading and 10% chicken(so it felt like biting into an ice sculpture). FYI: I don't ever send my food back to the kitchen or complain in person, because they are still handling my food.  As of the service the girl was pretty fast   But when I asked for napkins being that I was there with my child she gives me 2 pieces of napkin as if they were coming out of her paycheck. I believe I gave it a fair chance and it's definitely not a good place to go eat. Every time my family and I choose to go to Applebee's on Sunday, the whole staff looks zombie'd out and un bath  from the night before.

When we got there the waitress asked us right away what we wanted,meanwhile, we had just sat at the table. The soda was disgusting and tasted flat as ever. So I got the 2 for $20 and we got a side of onion rings, which were way too greasy and tasted so fake, then I got a chicken tender platter. NEVER EVER get those. The cole slaw was disgusting, and the chicken tenders and fries tasted so fake even freezer fries and tenders taste better then that. So when this waitress gave us our check, she instantly added gratitude for 2 people as a ten dollar tip. As much as I wanted to yell at the girl so bad for that I felt so nauseous from their food I left. Thanks so much for the horrible experience.

I really hate when food is way too salty. The service was the worst. It took forever to be greeted, to be served the food & to be asked how everything is. I needed a drink for at least 10 minutes before I finally tracked down someone to get it for me. Finally, we had to wait for the check for what seemed like 15 minutes at least.

Eve C.,"Oceanside, NY",90,58,7,1.0,12/5/2010,I want to start out by saying that I've eaten at other Applebees with positive outcomes so this review is only a  reflection of this location.  At first the service was good: pretty soon after we were seated the waitress came and took our drink orders and the drinks came pretty quickly. The food on the other hand seemed to take a bit longer than usual. But we didn't see the waitress at all until the food arrived.  2 out of the 3 steaks at our table were cooked improperly; mine wasn't even edible. I've never had worse cooked steak in my life. I think the waitress stopped by once while we were eating to check up on us and then took 20 min to get my soda refill after asking for it twice.

We have all been there at one point or another, so why bother with a review?  Well, my local one deserves a shout -out because they run a tight ship there.  Service is generally good there and things run smoothly.  A current special worth mentioning is half-price appetizers on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays after 8 pm during Football season.  Three delightful little sliders, with fries is one of those choices which is only $4.50 with this special.  Not too shabby! Big ol' basket of the boneless wings was I believe $ 5.  The only app not in this special was the sampler platter.  But no need to order that because you can go nuts with your pals and get a bunch of apps for that price!

Overall, the food here is decent for a chain restaurant.  The burgers and sandwhiches are good.  I wouldn't recommend getting the steak, it is usually cooked incorrectly and not a good quality steak either.  Also, I'm not a fan of the riblets, but I know of other people that do enjoy them, so to each his own.  Service is ok, usually better when it's not crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=40
Robert A.,"Syosset, NY",2,48,5,3.0,2/3/2013,"Went there own Saturday night around 6 pm. The joint was jumping. Rather than wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.  We were served right away. Let's face it, Applebee's is not gourmet food, but if you are looking for something quick and inexpensive, this is the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=40

Larry B.,"Farmingdale, NY",113,325,9,1.0,7/29/2012,"no different than any other applebee's location - bland cookie cutter food that i could easily get from the frozen food section of stop & shop...on second thought that stuff might be better, and I certainly wouldn't have the nightmares this parking lot delivers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=40
Michelle S.,"San Diego, CA",44,119,1,2.0,1/20/2009,I went here tonight for the first time for half o appetizers. The service SUCKED.  We waited a while to get our drinks they finally came and you could tell the beer was sitting because all the foam was down.  My friend ordered a drink he never got.  Food took a while. The food was alright.  I don't know if it was worth the wait. It could have been a bad night.  I would have gone to a more local spot if I could have redone the night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=40
Dave N.,"Great Neck, NY",79,290,,3.0,2/7/2011,"If you've been to one Applebee's, you've been to them all. Good, but extremely unhealthy food, and just okay service. Boneless wings are great as are the new wonton pork tacos.  Twofers are a pretty sweet deal, but it feels like they don't have half the beers on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-e-farmingdale?start=40
