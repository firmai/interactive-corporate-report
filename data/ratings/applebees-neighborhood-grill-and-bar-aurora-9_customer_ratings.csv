I missed some of the things I used to get but there are new things that looked good too. Always amazing oriental chicken salad. It just takes 30 minutes to eat it.  Also had potato chip and queso app. OMG amazing. I would eat the queso with a spoon. Was not too impressed with the desserts.

I asked him about his specialty drink and he made me a couple margaritas that were to reckon with.  My meal was pretty good - it's Applebee's ladies and gentleman. Usually when you go to a chain restaurant the food is pretty consistent. If it isn't, then you need to say something to management.  On a lighter note, I was watching the NCAA tournament and was taking a bite of my meal when the player from Louisville had a compound fracture to his leg on national TV.

I was beyond happy with my selections.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I was actually floored over the Mac and Cheese.  This was certainly not something that was boil noodles and squeeze a sauce over it.  There was roasted jalapeno bits through out the cheese sauce and covered in very large pieces of REAL BACON.     I was in a Mac and Cheese mood and this certainly hit the mark for me today.   Oh yes.. the soup.  This was a nice little cup of creamy Tomato Basil goodness.  Their happy hour starts at 3 so this also fits into my day nicely.   I will reurn!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-9,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

The moment we walked in we were so called greeted by a hostess who offered us seating in the ""bar area""   We declined the offer and  told the hostess we prefer not to be seated in the bar area. The hostess immediately had a attitude for some unknown reason, gave us the worst look, rolled her eyes and didn't say anything to us about finding us a table. Finally after 10 minutes she found us a table.  We didn't have any issues with anything else, but if you decide to come to this specific location, prepare your self for a hostess with attitude.

Having been a server myself, I know having just two people sit at your booth at 9:45pm is not the best case scenario. However, Steven was overly attentive and catered to our every need before we even knew we needed it!

Pretty much anything that your taste buds desire, they have it. I haven't really had a bad meal at any Applebee's I have been to.  This Aurora location is no exception.  Every time I go, I am in love with what I ordered.  This particular time we sat at the bar and were greeted by Natalie the bartender.  She was great! Ready with suggestions and checking in on our drinks to make sure we didn't run out of cold beer. I went with the quesadilla burger, which I have never ordered before but my boss raves about it all of the time. Natalie said it was a great choice as well. When that thing came out the first thing I thought was man, I am not that hungry. The quesadilla is packed with hamburger meat, lettuce, jack cheese, bacon, tomatoes and dripping in their mexi-ranch.  It was so big! I could only eat half.  I went to take a picture of the burger and the manager, John, came over to check on me.  I think he was worried that something was wrong with the food.  The complete opposite actually.  I loved it. Sorry for confusing John and throwing him off, but I just wanted to get a good picture of the quesadilla burger so I can put it on social media. Love this location and I will continue to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-9,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
23,Angela L.,"Denver, CO",0,12,,4.0,2018-01-05,"Applebee's has went up and down since we have been going. My husband and I have quit going here and there due to different things.  Our most recent experience was my family holiday lunch on 12/30/17 where we had a party of 20+ people.   First, they allowed me to call that morning to give them a heads up of a party that large coming in and had a table pulled together in the back corner for us which was greatly appreciated! Which by the way Texas Roadhouse told us they could not accommodate us in any way, shape, or fashion so we didn't go there. The waiter we had was great, he worked through all of our family madness with presents, and drinks, and weird food orders like a champ. His name was Kuiet (like ""Q""uiet with a K) and he was great! Everyone was happy with their food except my husbands hamburger, but I believe this issue is not necessary Applebee's but something to do with the lack of good ""burgers"" in Colorado? Maybe ""I"" need to read more reviews on here about hamburger places?! I ordered the special they had advertised on TV, which was the sirloin with the special topping, which I did the onions and mushrooms and the loaded potatoes which I did the loaded mashed potatoes, and it lived up to every delicious picture they show on their commercial!! Others raved about the bourbon chicken and shrimp dish which I can't remember if that is the real name of it, but at least 4 people got that, and my uncle got the fish and chips which was awesome because he let us taste it!  And very important the Blue Moon I had was super cold, if any one has had a Blue Moon, what does it have to be to be good...COLD! As for now...I would absolutely recommend this location and would suggest what I had above!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-9,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
