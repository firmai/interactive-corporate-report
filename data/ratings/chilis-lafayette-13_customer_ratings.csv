22,Matt P.,"Lafayette, CO",0,6,,4.0,2012-06-05,"Laughing that the other reviewer had a bad experience here.  Let's face it; sure we expect to eat good food when we go out, but it's Chili's.  You pretty much know what you're in for: it is usually pretty good, and if something comes out wrong the manager always offers to take care of it.  Justin, our favorite server at the Lafayette spot, and us were just taking about this today...he hopes his customer's have a good experience, but it's Chili's...you pretty much know what you're in for.  We go to Chili's because: A) the food is decent and we pretty much know what we're in for, B) it's real close to our house, and C) we are fortunate to have a server like Justin.  We walk in, sit in the bar area, and bang...coors light, pinot grigio, shirley temple, and chocolate milk show up.  He knows what we want and gets it before we have to ask.  Is that the same experience that everyone has here?  Probably not, but we live in Lafayette, Chili's ranks pretty high for culinary choices in the area, and if we wanted primo food we would be going to Boulder or Denver.  We do tend to avoid the dining room here, but it's only because if we're there having a cocktail, eating, and the kids are occupied by iPads, we can watch sports, laugh at people thinking they are having a serious experience in the dining room, and Justin only works in the bar.  So don't kid yourself...if it's date night, kids are at grandma's, and love is in the air...don't go to this or any Chili's.  But if it's ""what do you wanna eat?""...""I dunno whaddayou wanna eat?""...come eat here, sit in the bar, drink a beer, watch NBA, and just deal with it because you pretty much know what you're in for. By the way I give it 4 stars for convenience, location, staff, and (oh yeah) the triple dipper.  If their fries weren't so salty it would be a 5, but I complained and got them for free (just kidding)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13?start=20,,,,,
20,Leanne G.,"Lafayette, CO",405,346,295.0,3.0,2013-03-26,"This is an excellent place for a quick, easy dinner with the kids. The children's menu isn't anything special - not particularly healthy. However, the kids will be happy with the choices, and any parent knows that is a benefit! Its also OK if the children are loud, climbing about and generally carrying on... which parents also know is part of the territory. Generally the parents can eat something that isn't to chocked with calories, if you choose carefully. So overall, its a comfortable place for a quick dinner with the kids. Yea for that! It definitely has its place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13?start=20,,,,,
0,Colie J.,"Lafayette, CO",13,208,105.0,3.0,2013-07-13,"When we have actually eaten in the restaurant the service has always been prompt and food exactly as I ordered it. However when I order to-go it is hit or miss.  Sometimes there is a long wait to get the food, twice it has been incorrect, and so I always check my food before I leave. I love the 2 for $20 menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
21,Joel D.,"Lafayette, CO",1,23,4.0,2.0,2013-11-16,"They recently remodeled and gone are the traditional Chili's tables and booths. The new dining room lacks intimacy, feels like a cafeteria. Additionally we had a terrible waitress, treated us like it was an inconvenience to serve us. I don't think we'll be back. Food was fine but with all the choices in the area, why would I want bad service and poor ambience?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13?start=20,,,,,
18,Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,309.0,5.0,2013-12-03,"Just wanted to update my review as I bring my 93 year old Dad here once a week, and the server is excellent!  I wanted to send a shout out to Waldo.  He always remembers us at lunch time, and goes out of his way to take care of us.  He remembers our order as my Dad likes the same thing most times.  He always has a big smile too.  Great service and great food!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
5,Donna C.,"Lafayette, CO",29,239,25.0,2.0,2014-06-14,This had been a reliable back up for dinner with the kids since everyone can *usually* find something to eat. Expectations are low but figured we'd get reliable food and service. As others have mentioned -  it's kid friendly and typically everyone in the family can find something they want.  Service is terrible. Not sure if they are understaffed or just have slow service. It's never been fast but at our recent visit it took 10 minutes before we could order and then 25 before our food came. Being the sneaky mom that I am an anticipating slow service when it took 10 minutes to order I got the chips so the kiddos could munch on something. Too bad the chips were so saturated with salt in some places they were inedible. I think we'll avoid going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
16,Andrea C.,"Nashville, TN",40,13,2.0,1.0,2014-10-13,"I've been kicking myself in the ass for our last visit. I always expect a positive, good time wherever we go and while we (boyfriend and I) enjoy each others company, this was awful. We visited this past Friday. Not too busy. Fairly quick service. But I deeply regret spending almost $50 on that food. The chicken strips were soggy. The eggrolls were mushy. They charge for a dollop of sour cream! And I had one drink that was over $7. This was by far not worth it. I sincerely regret this visit and I highly doubt I will ever go to chili's again. Overpriced, shitty food. I never saw a manager and the server definitely didn't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
19,Renae G.,"Erie, CO",0,13,1.0,1.0,2014-12-15,"We just got home from here and I can't believe how bad it was. The fries tasted exactly like microwaved leftovers, so dry that it was hard to swallow, like they'd been sitting around for hours and then reheated. The chips were greasy and stale, loaded in an excess of salt, probably in an attempt to hide that they were past their prime.  My baked potato soup was so salty that I couldn't taste anything else. My daughter's mashed potatoes were served unevenly heated, half was cold and half was burning hot. Service took unbelievably long, which is torture when you have a toddler with you. We actually had to box up our food and take it home to eat, because by the time it finally arrived my daughter was done sitting in the high chair. I honestly don't get how it took so long, considering most of our food appeared to be microwaved.  There are far too many decent, local places to eat in Erie, Lafayette, and Louisville to waste money here. I feel like Chili's stole money from me today, and I will never give them that opportunity again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
15,Hamid A.,"Superior, CO",2,5,,1.0,2015-03-22,"We went in around late afternoon and the place was basically empty. We were seated by the hostess and the waiter greeted us immediately. We placed our order and the first thing we received were the appetizers. We ordered the chips and the guac. The chips were overwhelmingly salty the guac was not seasoned at all. When our food came in, I ordered the fajitas, again the meat was extremely salty. My friend ordered a steak, it was so over cooked and hard that it looked almost inedible. The fries were stale, the cheese on side still kind of frozen. Overall, the food was absolutely disgusting. No way I'm wasting money on this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
11,Tim P.,"Erie, CO",47,25,1.0,1.0,2015-03-28,"Food poisoning still no call from anyone. Terrible experience sick all night.  Chillis is really fast food in a restaurant atmosphere with over priced food table of four, $84.27 plus a tip they calculated at $13.00 too much for what was given. McDonald's menu would have produced the same results but with no alcohol and would have been $24.00. Never going back we are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
14,Corinne F.,"Edwards, CO",9,6,4.0,5.0,2015-05-16,"We visited this Chili's location after spending a long day in the ICU with a family member.  The staff had heard about our situation and were extremely kind to all of us.  They quickly brought our orders out as well as our drinks.  After our meal the Managing Partner, Alan Jensen, came to our table and asked how our meal was and how we were holding up.  It was such an unexpected surprise.  He was honestly concerned for all of us.  He offered us dessert and when we declined because we were so tired and were ready to go home, he instead took a percentage off of our tab.  A wonderful Chili's with awesome staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
13,Aaron K.,"Longmont, CO",0,6,,1.0,2015-12-16,"Worst experience in a restaurant in years. Took forever to order, food took a long time to come out, then it was kinda cold. My food was totally wrong. Her fajitas had some kind of grease all over them. We were very nice and didn't make a big fuss. Waiter never came by to check on us. The manager was dealing with a ten top that we're having problems. She walked by our table mumbling about the other table being assholes, so we didn't say anything to her. We just won't be back to any Chili's ever again. Terrible terrible terrible. I think am going to start berating anyone I know that eats at these crappy restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
17,Abby A.,"Denver, CO",1,12,,1.0,2016-03-06,"Picked up a to go order. Literally the worst food we have had in a long time. My pasta was not cooked, they forgot my husbands beans. Just a joke. I called and the manager did refund our money but was so cold on the phone like I was inconveniencing her. We will not be going back to this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
12,Maggie S.,"Lafayette, CO",74,10,6.0,1.0,2016-03-19,"I came in for dinner at the Lafayette, Colorado location this evening 03/19/2016. It took 15 min before our waiter, Andrew, acknowledged us and that was only because we asked if we had a waiter. We ran out of chips before our queso appetizer showed up. The waiter said he would be right back with some but never brought any.  My ""medium well"" steak was very red and hard to chew. When I complained I couldn't eat it they gave me 50% off the steak. Disappointed. I didn't even eat two bites. Our drinks were never refilled even though we were there for over an hour. We spent a lot of money on horrible food and service.  $50.  Would like a full refund please so we can try again as normally the food and service is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
6,Vicki B.,"Boulder, CO",1,7,1.0,3.0,2016-05-10,"It took a long time to get served, long to get a marg quickly to have while my order to go was getting ready to go. Now it's taking FOREVER to get my order to go that is supposed to be so quick. What a drag. I should have went to McDonald's. Crap good but at least if be eating by now and not lunch at dinner time. I don't know if this is a permanent situation or just what's going on but the waitstaff acts like someone's missing or something along that vein. They are running or scurrying around like they are catching up, which of course could very well be but it still seems odd. I've been here thru rushes before but this is different. BUT...I like the food as it's almost always good. And I like the waitstaff. I've been here before. What's going on is not normal. Maybe they need to hire someone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
8,David K.,"Boulder, CO",6,3,1.0,1.0,2016-07-07,"A miserable experience. Indifferent, slow service for terrible food. I can't tell if my buffalo wings came from a pigeon or bat. My wife's queso looked and tasted like rejected prison gruel. Our waiter was slow, rude, and proud of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
7,Honst G.,"Superior, CO",7,7,14.0,1.0,2016-07-16,I haven't been to a chili's in a couple of years. It used to be kinda ok. I have now sworn off any chain restaurants thanks to this Chili's. Service was horrible. My wife got half her meal and I never got mine. My sons food was cold. The manager did come out and comp our meal (what we got of it) we left and got dinner elsewhere. I would say this restaurant failed on every level. Oh and once the waitress figured out we weren't happy she simply never came by again. So the food that did show up was cold and not appetizing at all. Just a really poor experience on every level. Wouldn't recommend and telling everyone I know about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
4,Ginni T.,"Lafayette, CO",6,43,,4.0,2016-08-18,"I have always enjoyed eating out and rarely get to do it as I work crazy hours. I like this Chili's.It is within a mile of my house.  The food is almost always very good, and who can complain about the 2 for $20? I met a friend there last Saturday night at 6:30. I expected a long wait and loads of screaming kids. Thankfully I experienced neither. This Chili's is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is usually clean, cheap, the food and service good. We ordered the 2 for $20.00 and both got the 6 oz sirloins, medium rare. Both steaks were cooked to order and were decent cuts of meat-no real gristle to be found. Broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes were good. Server was attentive and polite. All in all not bad for 30 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
10,Trent T.,"Thornton, CO",0,3,,1.0,2016-10-29,Customer service sucks at this place. We were seated and then sat there for 20 min and no one even took are drink order we finally just left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
9,C G.,"Thornton, CO",1,11,,5.0,2016-11-04,"Yes, it's a chain. But I'm primarily reviewing the staff. All of them are fantastic, work hard, and get it right.  I've never had to wait on a table, and every once in a while I just eat at the bar, and only when there's a particular bartender working...I think her name is Page. She's funny and very personable, and is sharp as a tack. I don't live in the area, but when I'm there, I do try to stop in to have a meal and a laugh. Chili's is lucky to have Page working for them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
3,Alexandra A.,"Erie, CO",0,24,,1.0,2016-11-07,Probably the worst service I have received in such a long time.  It took so long to bring out our appetizers which I ordered when we placed our drink order I had to summon the hostess to track it down.  My salad had to be sitting in the window for so long that the lettuce was wilted.  Never refilled our water even after we asked and then never asked if we wanted dessert or anything else just brought us our check and then over charged us for something we didn't order. I doubt I will be back there again.  I just wish they would get more restaurants in this area so I don't have to settle for going here for horrible service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
2,James F.,"Millersville, PA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-11-20,"I haven't ate at Chili's in a while as it usually leaves me with low expectations but I thought I would give the one in Lafayette a try. I went in and I was greeted by the hostess and informed her that I'd be sitting at the bar and she said OK enjoy your meal. Everything is fine up until then and then I proceeded to sit at the bar for about five minutes without the bartender coming over to me...finally she said I'll be with you in one minute and then another five minutes go by and she's helping other people and not even asking what I'd like to drink so that point I got up and left. Thanks for nothing. There's a reason why Chili's will only ever be an "" I guess I'll go there kinda restaurant"" and not a destination restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
1,Rob O.,"Broomfield, CO",59,22,3.0,1.0,2017-12-04,"Well I can attest to why this Chili's ranks so low.  Stopped in on the way home instead of going to our regular location.....MISTAKE!  We were sat right away, as it was not busy for a Monday evening.  Waitress got our drink order quickly & then things just slowed from there.  Waited about 10 minutes b/4 she came back to take our food order.  Once that was taken, we waited almost 30 minutes for our food.  When it did come out eventually, she apologized & said; ""they had an issue in the back"".  A simple kids order & a Triple Play.  Food was cold all the way thru.  She didn't come back to check on us, until  1/2 the plate was eaten, so no sense trying to complain at that point, as I had no idea how long it would take for a replacement. After finishing up, went to pay the check thru the kiosk & realized that I was charged twice for the kids meal.  Waitress never returned, so asked another server for help with the bill, he said he would get a manager to fix it.  Never saw nor heard from a manager...POOR!  After another 15 minutes, looked at the bill again on the kiosk & they simply just split the check & never even told me about it. NEED MORE MGMT ATTENTION & OVERSIGHT!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lafayette-13,,,,,
