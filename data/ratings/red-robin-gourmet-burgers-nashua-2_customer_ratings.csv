69,Bill S.,"Tyngsboro, MA",23,10,8.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"GOOD FOOD / ""STRANGE"" SERVICE / A BIT OVERPRICED  First time going there and was excited to see what the ""Yum"" was all about. My wife and I had stopped in after some shopping. It was kind of a weird experience to be honest. They told us the wait would be 25 minutes and it ended up being 15 (good start). We were seated and after about 10 minutes, still no server (bad follow-up). Finally a waitress (possibly a mgr) who'd observed us looking around like abandoned ducklings came over. When she realized we we'd been deserted she offered us a free appetizer (good move). We ordered our meal and it took forever to come out (they weren't even that busy) and my burger had about 5 french fries with it. At this point we'd had a new waitress assigned to our table and she was very nice, she brought me a ton of fries (nice recovery). The burgers and fries were pretty good. We noticed that we were not the only table that was subject to painfully long waits, which tells me that there was a systemic issue. I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night or if they are like this all the time. I'll definitely give them another shot as their burgers are pretty good. However, for a $10 burger and an overpriced $5 shake, I expect better service. Get it together Robin!!!! If you're thinking about stopping in, I'd say go ahead... Just keep your expectations in check to avoid being let down. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=80,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

It was OK. the sauce too strong maybe if they went a little lighter or I should order it on the side. The burger was cooked perfectly but a little dry. probably squeezed the juice out on the grill.

72,Chris C.,"Brookline, MA",67,677,16.0,3.0,2012-01-12,"New option in the Nashua area. I have been to other locations in Arizona and enjoyed the place so I figured I'd try this location to see if it was the same. The fact that its new definitely shows with the service. They have a way to go before they run better. I have been a couple times now and have had issues with the orders every time I've gone so far with someone's order at the table. Hopefully with time they will work this out. They have a full bar, but I have yet to have anything from it. I have ended up with a frappe every time as they do a very good job making them. I skip the appetizers as the burgers are pretty filling and they offer bottomless fries with all the orders. I really like the mini burger option.  It is a smaller version of the regular burger that is not listed on the menu for some reason. I appreciate the option as I think the regular burgers are really big and leave me over stuffed if I eat the whole thing. The food has been consistently good and its a cheap quick option for food in the area.

The Good: - The food is awesome for the price point. - Quick Service - People watching The Bad: - The ""bottomless fries"" typically do have a ""bottom"". I have tested this with about 20 visits and only on two occasions they asked if I wanted more fries. - Special orders seems to get messed up by the kitchen staff. This has happened on several occasions.  - I find it extremely annoying that another waiter delivers the food to the table because they have no idea if something was ordered special or different.

Visit #1 - Fast, friendly service.  Prices were great.  Love the fries, burgers cooked as requested.  I forget what we had for an app but it was good but we had ""onion ring envy"" after seeing the stacked tower that was delivered to a nearby table.  We promised ourselves when we came back that we would share those as an appetizer. Visit #2 OMFG - what the...?  The waiter seemed high on something.  His pupils were so dilated - like he just came from an eye appointment.  If we could see this - surely the management could.  He spoke so fast you could hardly understand a word of what he said.  We laughed it off because we are not prudes and whatever, bring me a drink and burger and go off and do whatever you want in the bathroom, not my business.  We, and as we overheard, the table behind us had to return the soda three times before giving up.  We ordered diet and clearly were got regular.  Not the end of the world but 3 times, really.  And the table next to us had the same problem.  This guy could not keep it together.  I could see him, even after the complaints, loading up with multiple glasses and then not being able to figure out which was which.  How about just taking a few extra trips and bring them 2 at a time?  The onion ring tower that we promised ourselves came out just one minute before our burgers.  A manager came over and apologized and said she would take the app off the bill - not sure how she know about this - maybe the kitchen was having problems.  We ended up asking for glasses of water after we resigned ourselves to the fact the soda would never be right.  Anyway, my burger was burnt and my friend's was so pink I would say it bordered on dangerous.  They comped the whole meal =- again a manager came over to us without us saying anything so they for sure knew something was happening that night.   Our waiter should have been sent home - they never should have let him work in that condition.  It was so obvious and they must have known because manager after manager was apologizing to our side of the restaurant.  I even saw a conversation where another server was asking him to stop taking drink orders from her tables.  He definitely had no idea what was going on around him. Party on your own time - I just wanted a burger and some onion rings and the whole fiasco was disappointing.  I've give it some time and try again since visit #1 was great.  I'll look my server in the eyes and ask to be moved he reminds me of Mr. Magoo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=120,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
39,David H.,"Fort Worth, TX",17,36,21.0,1.0,2012-04-03,"You'd think that a place with the tag-line ""Gourmet Burgers"" would serve up decent burgers, right? I must have missed something because this is certainly not the case at Red Robin! You know how nice those fast food sandwiches look in the advertising, but if you are silly enough to order one they look as though they have been flattened by a truck? Same deal at Red Robin. I'd not been to this location although I seem to recall a lunch at another Red Robin in the past. Anyway, the Nashua store is a decent place and the staff OK (even though our waitress spoke so quickly I could only make out one word in about 10 - took me a while to decide she was actually speaking a version of English). The food looks great in the photos in the menu - yay, bring on the big burgers, I'm bloody starving. The illusion is shattered when the little flat package is delivered. The burgers are so thin it would be impossible to cook them the medium rare we ordered. Fries? I think I got about 6 - no-one said anything about free fries top-ups, although that might have been in the 9 words out of 10 we couldn't understand. I'd rate the burgers at about 50% as good as Fat - Oops sorry Five - Guys at quite a bit more cost (not that Fat Guys burgers are that great - just way better than here). We are pretty much in a burger wasteland in Nashua anyway - want a decent one? Best drive over to Owen & Ollie's in Dracut.

I had no idea they were opening up at the Pheasant Lane Mall and had actually eaten the first time I saw them. I shook my fist and vowed to return, which my friend and I did less than a week later.  I've only been in Red Robin once and I foolishly ordered a roast beef sandwich instead of their famous burger. I did not make that mistake again! The burger was delicious. Probably the best one I've had at a chain restaurant. The portion was big and the price was great. I did not like the sweet potato fries. Somehow some regular ones were mixed in, and they tasted so much better. Next time, I'll have to go with the fries. My friend wanted melon (listed on the menu) but they don't serve that anymore. He ended up getting the only rice they offered which was extremely spicy. My other quibble is that they messed up my iced tea. I got one of the 10 calorie, unsweeted ones and it was great so I got a refill and they brought me a sickly sweet one just loaded with sugar and then never returned to check on us.  It was very busy in there. Packed with families and the wait to get seated for two was just under ten minutes.

My only issue is the pricing and the specials. I think the food is slightly overpriced and they hardly have specials going on. Also the reward card;, the servers never ask for mine and they always bring the receipt and then they have to reprint the receipt after I give them the royalty card. Annoying. Other than that its a great place to bring the family or even to go with friends. I have worked in the mall for six years and I would say this is one of the best places to eat that has a fun atmosphere in the area.

The burger, as a whole, is a huge object - the actual patty is quite thin (though cooked to perfection, I have to add.) You are getting 80% toppings/bun, 20% burger - if that. & maybe some of you don't want a giant piece of hamburger, but I do. All the ingredients are pretty fresh (lettuces, tomatos, etc.), & the seasonings are noticeable & tasty, but the burgers are just lacking something. I feel like they rely on toppings, sauces, & seasonings to pump up the taste that the meat itself should be providing. The nitpick-y: The caramelized onions - not caramelized. The bun - not toasted (though I probably could have asked for this.) The fries - never the sweet potato ones I specifically ask for. No, really, every time I've ordered here, they don't give me sweet potato fries, but you can bet they charge me for them anyway! I have no complaints about service, except for being put on hold indefinitely when I called in my order - the girl who originally answered definitely forgot about me, but whomever picked up a couple of minutes later was helpful.

105,Helen M.,"Hooksett, NH",1,44,,2.0,2012-07-01,"Red robin has nostalgia written all over it. My mom has fond memories of going here when she was younger down south so I had to eventually make it over.  My date and I ordered the tower of onion rings which came with 2 dipping sauces, he ordered the crispy chicken ""burger"" and I had the mushroom burger. First the good. The onion rings were delish. Crispy and greasy with soft onion running throughout. The sauces that came with them were standard, ranch and a fancy BBQ. My date said the chicken burger was pretty good, it came with lettuce tomato and those bottomless fries. My burger was huge with tons of toppings on it. Service was quick and didn't bother us much besides to refill our drinks and to drop off the bill, which I preferred. Now the bad. Although my burger was huge I wasn't all the impressed. I asked for some pink and it came out basically raw after the first bite. More rare when I prefer medium rare. The burger itself didn't have much flavor and I was disappointed that the burger didn't come with any lettuce tomato or pickles, just a huge pile of shrooms.  The seating was awful. We got the worst seat in the place I think, a tiny booth right across from the kitchen. I wouldn't have minded if the place was packed but there were plenty of other tables open. I considered asking to be moved but decided to not be too much trouble. I should have though because being so close to the open kitchen, my date and I had full view of the servers and cooks calling each other names and throwing insults around. I've worked in kitchens so I know what goes on, but there's nothing like biting into your burger to the lovely sound of the cooks called each other dick-wads lol. Our server however was very nice and we watched her work her butt off the whole time; I wish I'd gotten her name. Overall I wasn't expecting fine dining so I wasn't surprised when I didn't get it.

Especially when those other people are teenage boys that just want to be allowed out in public and eat unlimited baskets of fries. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive, though that may have been because two of the boys I brought looked like they might start a riot if they didn't eat quickly (and they might have, to be fair). We were never without drink refills, and our waiter even dropped off a complimentary basket of fries to appease the beasts. I do wish he'd said something before loading these kids with caffeine on me, though, he was just too quick with the drop-offs! When our food arrived, my order was the only one that was correct. To be fair, each order had something missing or changed from the menu, but he did write these things down and they still came back with veggies/toppings we'd asked not to include, or cooked too little or too much for our specifications. I did appreciate that they serve burgers protein-style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce instead), and perhaps that brought attention to my order and is the reason it was done correctly. Lucky for them, the boys were in a forgiving mood and too hungry to care about the lettuce or tomatoes or wrong kind of cheese. They stuffed their faces and moved on, but it easily could have turned into a disaster. I ordered sweet potato fries that were pretty overcooked, and the boys all had mac & cheese that they told me ""wasn't the most exciting.""

111,Mel S.,"Gardner, MA",0,62,,3.0,2012-11-20,"I stopped in with my mom before heading out on a shopping trip.  It was my first time in a Red Robin, and honestly it was exactly what I expected as an ex-customer of Applebee's and a previous customer of TGI Fridays, Chili's, etc: nothing special in a typical atmosphere.  Since I expected that, I wasn't turned off by its generic menu and scene. Pros: * The employees seemed nice enough.  We were sat almost immediately after walking through the doors. * The kitchen manager visited our table shortly, yet not immediately, after our food was delivered to ask how we were doing.  I don't know which restaurant started that fad, but I love it. * The food was good.  I'm a vegetarian with a weak stomach, so my options are usually limited.  I ordered the chips with guacamole and salsa along with a side salad.  My mom ordered one of their burgers (wish I could remember which one - it had pineapple and jalapenos on it) and she loved it.  The steak fries are delicious and BOTTOMLESS. Cons: * Though seated quickly, we were not approached by anybody to take our drink order for quite awhile.  The restaurant was not very busy and they had at least 4-5 waitstaff working. * The tea, unlike coffee, is not bottomless.  The waitress explained it had to do with inventory, but this has to be the first restaurant I've been to in years that charges for each tea bag used.  As a heavy tea drinker, and winter creeping up on us, this was highly disappointing. * We weren't provided with silverware and had to ask for it after our meal was served.   When it was finally brought over, it was dropped on our table by our waitress as she passed to go to the next table because they were about to do their ""happy birthday"" bit for someone.  I personally felt as though we were being a burden to her at that point. * The dressing for my salad didn't come out with the salad, and we had to ask another waitress to bring it over. All in all I might go back to give the place another go, but it won't be any time soon.  It's not a place I'd recommend unless it was to someone who loves burgers since my mom seemed to really love what she ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=100,2.76,2.76,2.76,3.0520000000000005,2.76

For an economy that supposedly isnt doing to good the place was packed. And I guess had been busy for a while. We were originally told that it would be a 15 minute wait, which was ok. After 15 minutes another person came over and informed all of us waiting that ""somehow the IPad they used for seating had erased all the names. A bunch of people left after that. We stayed figuring hey, not starving it's all good. Waited another 10 minutes and were seated by the kitchen. Not a big deal. Waitress came and took our drink order pretty fast. We also ordered an appetizer but were told that two of the items on the appetizer list were not available. Ok. Ordered the moz sticks. Which came out pretty quick. A bit later the waitress came back and we began to order our meals. One of our party wanted a chicken finger plate. At which time the waitress informed us there was no chicken.  Huh? Two items on the appetizer menu not avail and also no chicken? Who does the ordering for this place? After a quick go over of the menu a substitute was found and we ordered our meals. And waited. And waited. Two tables seated after us were served before us. Burgers. Just like we ordered. Another waitress came over to tell us our meals would be ""right out""  A few minutes later they were delivered. And they were  ""Meh"" at best. The fries were cold. Granted not ice box cold, luke warm. And the burgers were far from being hot as well. All and all not a great food experience. With the appetizer(which they were out of the two things we wanted) The two adult sodas and a milk shake.

I've come with a large group of girlfriends, I've come as one of two couples, etc. Service, like at most Red Robins, is hit or miss.

Currently as I'm writing this review in-house, our waitress is bare-minimum helpful- no more, no less. H and I had to chase her down to give us one ""bottomless fries."" The food (or its taste, I guess) is why I come to Red Robin. If I want a banzai burger, I know it'll taste like it did when I ordered it in Connecticut, New York or California.

My mom ordered the soup and salad combo. For the soup, she chose French Onion Soup which consisted of onion, cheese, bread in a beef broth - it was salty to the point it was not edible. For the salad, she chose Caesar salad which consisted of fresh romaine lettuce drenched in Caesar dressing and garnished with croutons. My dad ordered the Arctic Cod Fish and Chips with a bowl of French Onion Soup. The Fish and Chips was crispy and served with tar tar sauce. Since both of them weren't satisfied with the soup, we asked to switch them to New England Clam Chowder which was considerably better. It was thick, creamy, and rich like a chowder should be. I ordered a Sauteed Shroom Burger which consisted of beef patty, sauteed mushrooms, and swiss cheese on a garlic toasted sesame bun. I added onion straws to the burger, asked for campfire sauce on the side, and substituted the bottomless fries for sweet potato fries. The fries weren't fresh as they were room temperature.

52,H C.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,2015-08-11,"I went to eat at Red Robin's with my boyfriend and me as well as 7 other people, totaling a table of 9. Never had I had a bad experience until this visit. It was actually the first time for 7 of the 9 guests at Red Robin's and they were rather disappointed, with the service especially.. My boyfriend and I ordered appetizers and we did not receive any plates to eat our food on so over the table (and without napkins) it was. My boyfriend also ordered a shake which dripped a little bit on the table and that wasn't cleaned by our waitress nor did she offer so my boyfriend had to eat the appetizers over the table, the dirty table. Food had arrived so we were all excited.  Sucks that the burger I was amping my best friend who came with us to get, was completely off (may I remind you again, his first time). My boyfriend and I also ordered the same burger and all three tasted not like how it usually does.  There was absolutely no sweetness or candied bacon in our southern charm burger... My cousin's prime rib entrée was way too salty for him.  I actually love salty food but even that was too salty for me. So we sent that back. Does anyone wanna send any food back on their first visit? Yeaaaaaah. My boyfriend had ordered sweet potato fries with his burger.  He received regular fries which is fine as he thought he could just easily ask our waitress for the fries he ordered.  Maybe the waitress didn't feel like grabbing them after my boyfriend asking her twice for his sweet potato fries or she wasn't attentive, I don't know.  Either way, my boyfriend (who actually isn't picky or needy when it comes to food) actually said to me that if he had to ask for his fries one more time, no tip will be given due to the carelessness and inattentive waitress.  I was honestly surprised that he even gave the 3 bucks he did. I think the best part of our meal was when the waitress brought out our bill  1. before we asked for it . 2. before we finished eating our food. 3. a lot quicker than serving us, her customers.

When they turned up the lights you could see that her burger was so rare you could have slapped a bandaid on it and sent it back to the pasture. Plus you could have literally wrung out the grease from the bun. I ordered the Uber burger, which was a burger with a bratwurst on top. The bratwurst was black. Not dark grill marks.....black.  My onion rings were just a shade lighter than the bratwurst. Disgusting.  Oh, and the drinks, an ice tea and a rootbeer float were warm.  How a drink with ice cream in it can be warm is beyond me, but apparently the folks at Red Robin are better at bending the laws of thermodynamics than they are at preparing a simple meal.

In Salem, it took forever to get our (2) hamburgers prepared and delivered.  We had nothing special ordered for condiments and it wasn't at all busy.  It seemed everyone from the waitresses down to the manager had an attitude. Sour faces when taking the order and a ""shrug it off"" attitude when we asked why the burgers were taking so long to be delivered. Some 40 minutes later, the burgers finally arrived.  I hate to see how long it takes when the restaurant is fully filled. We decided to try Red Robin again in Nashua; you guessed it...ten times worse.  Once again, the place wasn't busy at 3:00 PM. The chicken wing appetizers, after 25 minutes, never made it to our table.  The waitress said they would be up in a few minutes and suddenly, disappeared, then 10 minutes later, she hurried by and the chicken wings never arrived.  We went to shag the assistant manager who apologized profusely. He told us they burned the first batch but the next was on the way and that he wouldn't charge us for the wings.  Another 10 minutes go by and we get our salads and burgers with another apology that some other waitress picked up the chicken wings appetizer we ordered and gave it to her customers' by mistake.  The honcho general manager then came over and once again, apologized profusely. We were really ticked at this point and kept our cool, but told him he should cover the whole bill for the stinking service and the 45 minutes wait, which he did. There is no excuse for screwing chicken wings up, not once, but twice! While the free meal was appreciated, it doesn't cut it for routine piss poor service in (2) separate locations.  When waitresses don't read an order and don't get reprimanded for taking another customers' order, and the cooks in the kitchen get away with burning food and aren't fired for flirting with the waitresses, something is terribly amiss.  Hey... assistant manager and general manager, take authority there, do your damn job! Who runs this corporation? Don't you train employees about customer care and doing your job correctly the first time?  This corporation will certainly loose profits if they continue hiring bottom of the barrel employees. Fire the idiots who walk past customers as though they are invisible!   NO, we don't want to play your stupid trivia games!

A little bit of time went by and Justin came over and told us he went and checked on our food and the girl who was carrying it dropped it so they were starting new ones. I could tell he thought I would be upset but I worked in kitchens long enough to understand sometimes this happens. He was extremely apologetic and was very appreciative that I wasn't upset. It didn't take long for our meals to come out and they were both excellent. I decided to let my little friend have dessert and she chose the mud pie. It was very good even though we barely ate a quarter of it. Justin told me our dessert was on the house to make up for dropping our lunch. I was blown away because of how amazing our waiter had been. I've been to some of the best restaurants in Ma, Nh, Ny, Ct, and Me and I have found that service like this is rare. All in all today we had a great lunch and we will be back soon!

118,Lori D.,"Pepperell, MA",14,30,39.0,4.0,2017-04-08,"Having read other reviews here, I have to wonder when some of these visits were from a timing perspective.  If you choose to eat out in this particular area (malls, shopping...) during peak weekend and shopping and errand times, you will almost never have a great dining experience along with all the other thousands of people trying to do the same thing. Simply put, the volume of hungry customers far exceeds the number of seats available to feed all the hungry hoards tearing down the doors for a seat. Now we add people waiting and watching those who are eating. And hoping they will eat fast so they will pay and leave so we can be seated to be fed.   A perfect storm for taxed out restaurants and crew and hungry shopper warriors. Then there are those who go super late when the place is going to close down in less than an hour and the crew is cleaning up for the day, and in gear down mode....not fire up the stove for more food prep. Not making excuses, just looking at this realistically. When you go plays a big role in what your experience will be. We went today, Saturday, late afternoon at around 3 pm. The tween time. Some tables had people, some were empty. Service was very good. Food was hot and prepared as we expected. Good quality angus cheeseburgers with bacon. Sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries - both were good.  No, this was not Flemings steakhouse. It's a burger place. It was neat and tidy inside. We will go back.

For lunch one sis and I ordered off the lite lunch page in the menu, and had the lettuce ""bun"" burger. This is an excellent option when you don't want the extra calories and carbs of a bun. The burger is served in a foil wrap so it does not get too messy while eating it. My other sister had the veggie burger and was very complimentary about it, in fact we chose Red Robin because this sister is a fan of their veggie burger. She paired her sandwich with garlic fries. My other sister and I swapped out the fries for cole slaw.

We had to sent it back and the second time it came the pieces of the nachos were burnt.  The gourmet burgers that it claims to offers were not tasty and the best thing about the burgers was the bun.  He meat was dry and tasteless.  We order some of the sauces for the fries but did not receive it, even after asking for it twice.  When it comes to the milkshakes, it was mostly filled with whip creams versus the actual shakes itself.  I would not recommend this place because I think it is way overpriced for the types of food it has to offer.
