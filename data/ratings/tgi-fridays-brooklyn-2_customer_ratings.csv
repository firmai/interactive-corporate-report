27,Kyle S.,"Cleveland, OH",16,37,35.0,5.0,2013-10-17,"Not usually a fan of the big chains but we had a Giftcard. Fridays is Fridays, nothing fancy but I guess good when there are no other options, or I you have a Giftcard. I give my visit 5 stars for one reason. My 1 year old son decided to vomit all over the place about 5 minutes after being seated. Three people on the staff there came over offering to clean it up. I couldn't make someone else clean up that crime scene but I was shocked they offered.

12,Precious R.,"Cleveland, OH",149,108,136.0,3.0,2014-08-21,"Tgi Friday's to me has good, not exactly great food.  The hostess that took my table's drink order was short & rude. She was so awkward when she came up to my table telling us our server was busy & she'd be taking our drink orders. That was so weird especially since our server came 2 mins after the hostess took our drink orders. Anyway....our server was really nice & very attentive.  I ordered the Jack Daniel's Mixed Grill with the grilled chicken & half a rack of ribs. I also got a side of the parmesan steak fries & the mac & cheese. I could have on passed both of the sides especially, the mac & cheese. The chicken & ribs were good because of the jack daniel's sauce that I love!  For dessert, my table got the whiskey cake...oh my goodness, it was good! It's a toffee cake with pecans & it also came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Overall, I like Tgi Friday's for the Jack Daniel's dishes to me, is their signature for this chain. Tgi Friday's isn't the greatest but, it's good for nights when you just don't know where to eat out at. Better than Applebee's in my book but, that's just me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

Stood at front reception desk for almost 5 minutes before someone came and proceeded to tell me what a bad day she is having....I DON'T CARE!

The waitor bought me the wrong food, overcharged my bill, didnt refill my water, and didnt add my meal to my points. Then when asking to speak with a manager, the manager took 20 minutes to get there, and then asked me would i like an appitizer for my trouble, dude!!!! i had enough points for a whole  meal, why did you think that would solve my problem?

28,Colin M.,"Lakewood, OH",0,5,1.0,5.0,2015-03-25,Went to Fridays last night with a party of 9 adults. Went for appetizers and drinks only on this visit. We all tried the endless appetizers option and they were all excellent. Service was very efficient and all of the apps were served hot. We must have tried everyone on the menu. Tastes were very nice and presentation was excellent. All were satisfied with their drinks. Prices were very reasonable. Look forward to returning and trying more items on the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2?start=20,,,,,

So a salad was on the menu.  The Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad was delicious and filling.  The Chipotle crema drizzled around the salad is thick and yummy, not spicy at all.

31,Heather B.,"Columbus, OH",0,9,,5.0,2015-07-21,"Have had a couple not so great experiences at this restaurant a few months ago, but since it is so close to home, I decided to give it another chance. I am so glad we did because our last three experiences were wonderful! We usually sit in the bar area and I must say that the bar staff is the reason we keep coming back! The service is always friendly and efficient regardless of how packed the section is, and sometimes every table and bar stool is filled. The food has been much better and twice now I have gotten a perfectly medium burger as I ordered. I've found it extremely difficult to get a good cook on a burger at most chain restaurants, but last week I ordered the New York Bacon Cheese Burger and it was perfectly cooked and really delicious. They have a good selection of drinks at reasonable prices that is matched in quality with the service! We will be back to this locations often and telling others about our great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2?start=20,,,,,
11,Jess M.,"San Diego, CA",117,85,161.0,1.0,2015-07-25,"If I could give this Friday's, I would give it a 0. The service was so-so at best. It took 40 minutes to get seated, then the kitchen got backed up so that was we had to wait about an hour to get our food. When we got out food it was messed up. My food was burnt, my dad and uncles food wasn't right, my moms food was gross AND SHE GOT A SALAD! The manager came over and apologized, even took 50% off the bill. Considering that I'm from out of town the likely hood of me coming back to this Friday's is low, but after this horrible Friday's experience I am NEVER coming back to this Friday's!

0,Dieter V.,"Solon, OH",65,247,76.0,5.0,2015-12-30,Good bites along with a convivial atmosphere makes this a destination to meet friends and family.  The appetizers came out hot and savory.

14,Harry T.,"Cleveland, OH",0,22,5.0,1.0,2016-02-03,"HORRIBLE! The service was bad and the food was worse. They seated us and then never came back. We had to flag someone down. My wife and I ordered steak. She asked for well done, I asked for medium. Both were very underdone. Mine was bloody and so tough I could not eat it. My wife sent her's back and they still could not get it right. After all the problems the waitress told us that the meal was free, then brought us a bill. The manager knew about the situation but never talked to us, because they had to make a phone call. That's what we were told. What is more important, the customer at a table or the phone?

We ordered appetizers and sat waiting for 50 minutes! Our waiter came by, said ""still waiting"" as he saw our glasses empty and ignored us and walked by. Only when we flagged him down a second time did he get our drink order, and then sent another server to do it. We saw one waiter visit each of his tables numerous times before ours came by to check on us once. We eventually spoke with that waiter, David, and he apologized several times before we left.

She kept coming over to update me; the keg was getting changed, the keg was changed but all foam, it's almost ready... Finally, I got my perfect pour! Some places just leave you hanging. I really appreciated this service.  The food was also great. The wingman's burger had a lot of flavor without being overwhelming to the taste of the burger itself. The brownie possession..well, let's just say it's rich, gooey, and delicious! I think it paired nicely with my Sam Adams Boston lager.

9,Holly M.,"Tower City, Cleveland, OH",129,6,,1.0,2017-04-26,"This was an utterly disappointing experience. My husband and I have been to Friday's several times before-- but we usually go to the Crocker Park location. We also don't get the opportunity for ""date nights"" very often since we work opposite shifts.  Therefore, tonight we were excited to spend some time together and grab a bite to eat. We went to this location for dinner and it was absolutely terrible. We had both ordered the $10 endless apps, and I'm not sure if that somehow cued the staff to thinking we weren't going to tip well since we ordered ""the deal,"" but that's never the case. We were ignored and our drinks sat there empty alongside finished plates for 16 minutes (yes I counted after our first plates/drinks, came out and then sat there forever). Several servers kept walking by us-- I literally thought I was being punked.. where are you Ashton?!?! So ridiculous. Best part... when we asked for our checks (although we wanted another drink each and my husband wanted one more app (after the first appetizer they bring out baby portions- which is also dumb because that's more work on them)), the waiter stood there waiting for him to pull out his credit card and said ""I don't want to keep you waiting."" Oo my the irony. Seriously?! Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

2,Summer D.,"Toledo, OH",265,245,1447.0,1.0,2017-06-15,Shame on them. There is a reason you see a good number of these going out of business. Arrived on a not busy Thursday at almost 9pm. Stood and waited to be seated for almost 10 minutes. There were maybe 25 folks in the whole restaurant. Waitress was not knowledgeable about drink selection then looked put out when I asked her to please find out about a beer she had no clue about that was on tap. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks. Then I asked for a glass and after another 15 minutes I went to the bar and asked the bartender for one myself. Smh. About 40 minutes we have nothing. My friend ordered a side salad ribs n spinach. I just got an appetizer. She never came back until the food showed and brought my friend the salad with her entree. Then tried to argue that that is normal. Nope side salad comes first or at the minimal at least ask the customer if they want the salad first. My friend comes to this fridays at least once/week. And why are you trying to argue with your customer instead of making her happy? Food was actually OK but by this time who wants it and we were plenty unhappy. I asked about a birthday dessert for me because my birthday was a few days back. Fridays always does a free dessert for their card members. She says we only do a scoop of ice cream now. Well I can't eat ice cream. Well thats the only thing we do. Really? Even if it will make me sick?  Let me out of here. Darn shame.

I had the black bean burger with avocado it was great . My wife had the cajun shrimp pasta it was good . The appetizers were horrendous the bacon nachos they served us had stale chips tasted like the Morton salt factory and cheese and probably undercooked bacon didnt look done . The chicken quesadilla had 2 slithers of onion no pico on the side nothing . Service is ok here friendly staff but slipping on the basics like napkins on the table wowww 4 napkins for 2 people with the endless app deal . I should say the endless slop deal Im a big food person and I have been cooking since I was 9 and this is the worse of any of the corporate restaurants Ive seen. The burgers are all good so if you eat here play it safe folks I better get my Donagel ready now!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

1,Eric D.,"Kent, OH",116,106,97.0,1.0,2017-11-26,"Unlimited Apps are $15 now, are you flipping kidding me. $10 was okay because it just barely crosses that double digit threshold and carried many options but now its just the loaded pot. skins, boneless wings, pot stickers, meatball, and mozz sticks. That is it! Most disappointing and, to sound uneducated, SAD! I did not get a menu with this information on it until I had ordered and it was too late. I found this out on my phone. Now to Brooklyn. I was with a friend and we could not decide where to go and we were too close to get on the highway and go to Red Robin as I wanted. So we went here, mind you, this is on the Friday after Thanksgiving. The restaurant was empty and we sat at the high tops by the bar as I typically do. Our waitress, whose name I will not mention, came by and took our drinks. So far so good. My friend got some tea and I got the typical sink water. Then she returned briefly to take our orders and then she was out of lives like those who we knew were sick but were nearing the end of life but it is never enough to satisfy the answers to letting go.  I got my order and so did my friend after about 20 minutes which is long for apps but whatever. She was no where to be found. I wanted to order my next refill and my friend wanted some more cheese for her pretzels. Our waitress was in sight and we made eye contact but no return. I wonder, did I say something wrong or use too much personality that is it scaring her away? So I decided to stare directly into her soul. Nothing. So finally my friend hollered and she returned and asked if someone took my order for a refill. Nope, that is what you do. She acknowledged our requests and said BRB. She was out of our lives like that fleeting summer wind that directs patronage ambitions of being a summer bird.  She finally came back after 20 minutes and when I was dying for water and more apps. So I ordered more and then she left again like the air from the lungs of girl screaming after a plunder down a daisy hill.  Point is, we got awful service and we decided to leave after only three orders because we could not wait much longer. Now I have friends in food and swear that you should tip any service. Eat my shoe. I refuse to give someone 20%+ when they do a poor job. I cannot do a half job and send results out to cure a disease. She is not curing disease but I have to work to make the money she will receive and I cannot condone supporting poor performances when there are people looking for her position. So we both are typically good tippers, she better than me being a nurse, but we both left a few singles and left. I am not returning so this joins Harry Buffalo Parma Heights as a location I refuse to visit. Do not go here even if they offer you candy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
