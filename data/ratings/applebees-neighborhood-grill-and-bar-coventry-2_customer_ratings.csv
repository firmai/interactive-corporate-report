First, for whatever reason the airconditioning was on so high we all had goosebumps. Granted it was a cooler evening in August, but I still couldnt understand that. We ordered the margharita chicken and shrimp, two bacon cheese burgers, and one kids sliders. The two burgers seemed decent enough, although the fries were soggy and overly salted. My daughters sliders looked dried out and she barely ate the. The chicken and shrimp was so heavily salted and covered in lime and 'oil?' I could barely stomach it. I did eat the meal but unfortunately ended up spending too much time in the bathroom of one of the local stores. Unbelieveable. I just love wasting money on food that I could have easily prepared much better myself - let along getting sick from it.  I dont think we will be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2?start=20,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

Today I was trapped at a Hampton Inn and couldn't find anything with a good review near us so sauntered on over to this place. The locals all seemed to know each other and the vibe was kinda nice. My green bean appy was tasty with the horseradish sauce and the bourbon steak wasn't bad in a pinch.

Both times I've been here were pretty busy Friday evenings and service was pretty quick, much better than other Applebee's that I've been to.  For those not familiar with the menu, the 2for$20 has a lot of good options. Personally, I like the three cheese chicken penne and the fiesta lime chicken. They also have a 2for$24 option that includes a version of the pasta with honey barbecue chicken and that is one of my favorite items on the menu. If the 2for$20 isn't your thing, I also like the quesadilla burger.  I've recently discovered their ""Perfect Margarita"" which is pretty close to perfect. Unlike the house margaritas they offer as a late night special, this one packs a punch, and I recommend it. I stick with the traditional flavoring, but they do offer fruity favors for those who like fruits and have an extra 25¢.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

We got them a drink and our onion rings came, all was going well. It was a pretty busy night. Our waitress took our order in good time and it came in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Seems like a more than three star review up to this point I know. Now for the rest if the story. Our waitress was a little distracted. Couldn't 'find her words' some times. Everyone has an 'off' night. On top of the waitress distraction Appleby's has these new monitors on the tables that seem to just take up space and advertise. When we were ready to check out the waitress told us we can slide our card through the monitor to pay and promptly disappeared and did not return.  Since we were splitting the bill, and there are no instructions with the monitor we tried to flag down the manager and our waitress to no avail. The monitor allows you to 'call for help'. For the love of all things sacred, do NOT press this button. An extremely annoying red light on top of the monitor will begin to blink incessently until someone shows up to stop it! Talk about adding insult to injury. So Appleby's, PLEASE, include instruction on how we are supposed to use the new gizmo and customer, if you are paying with cash, alert the wait staff before the check arrives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

27,Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285.0,4.0,2015-07-24,"For years...MANY years, I have gone with the mantra of ""I'm not eating at Applebee's...I hate Applebee's"".  Had many bad experiences at different Applebee's to include crappy service, a menu I hated, and one meal that I think left me, let's say, incapacitated for about a day. Fast forward to this past Wednesday when I picked my daughter and her teammate up from a field hockey camp...and they were ravenous.  I had to stop somewhere and I was the nonly one with the anti-Applebee's syndrome so I caved and we at at this particular location.  Walk in, seated immediately, and the place is fun and loud and clean (lunchtime crowd).  I'm very skeptical when I sit down, but I'm also pretty hungry...so I look over the menu.  I look over at my wife with a shoulder shrug and a 'meh' look on my face as nothing is jumping out at me.  She looks back and tells me to grow up and just order a damn burger... So I turn to the menu page and see they have two kinds of burgers-classic burgers with toppings and these new 'handcrafted' burgers where the toppings are chopped up and smashed into the burger itself.  Hmmmmm, that's interesting.  Our attentive waitress comes over and takes our order - boneless wings, french onion soup and a side Caesar salad with chicken AND double crunch fried shrimp for my daughter (told you she was ravenous), classic cheeseburger for my wife, and I ordered the Sweet Asian Pineapple handcrafted burger which has pineapple & spicy Sweet Asian Chile sauce smashed into the burger and is topped with Jack cheese. And what happened next?  Well if you look back up at the four stars you can probably guess... DAMMIT!  I love a good burger-deep down I'm a pretty simple guy when it comes to a burger no matter what the toppings are...hot, cooked medium, lots of flavor (meat and toppings), and juicy.  Burger came out exactly as I just described...I SO want to go back to hating Applebee's, but this burger just took them off the banned list for me...it was serioulsy one of the best chain burgers I have had in a VERY long time.  The service here was great, the food was really good (though my daughter wasn't a huge fan of the french onion soup - too much cheese and tasted like it was made with a mushroom soup base), and dammit, the burger was great.  Ok, Applebee's, you win...I will put you back on the list of chains I am willing to eat at when we are out and about...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,,,,,

Nothing spectacular. But every waitress, host, bartender was exceptional in my option. I wanted to order take out and the host was very nice, encouraged me to have a seat look at the menu and take my time. Then while I was waiting I sat at the bar, and the bartender was cracking jokes, made me laugh and was very sweet and nice. While I walked out, I overheard a different host interacting with people that just walked in, and she was very happy, smiley and inviting.  I've never been to an Applebee's with such happy, exceptional workers! I just had to let someone know- kudos to you for creating such a warm, welcoming environment.

31,Nick M.,"Coventry, RI",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-23,Staff should spend less time on their phone and more time making sure the customer has a good experience. I sat in my car for 40 minutes before having to go inside to find that my food had been sitting on a shelf for 25 minutes instead of being brought out. Won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

25,Michael M.,"Coventry, RI",1,158,6.0,4.0,2017-01-31,No complaints.  The service was great.  Sorry I forgot her name but we sat at the bar and the female bartender was very fast yet very professional and very friendly.  She did a phenomenal job with handling a very busy bar and restaurant while still providing great service and being very personable.  The food came out quickly and was very good.  No complaints here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

22,Mary Q.,"Coventry, RI",4,140,84.0,3.0,2017-09-20,"Perfectly fine chain experience.  We go here all the time for cheap food.  Nothing special but service is typically good and drinks are good.   Kids meals are a good deal.  Lots of options.   Regular bar food for a good value.  Not many healthy options but really, don't expect much and you will be just fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
21,Allie L.,"Cranston, RI",86,97,195.0,4.0,2017-10-25,"I know everyone says ""I don't like to go to chain restaurants"" however I don't get that vibe when I am here. It's located in a shopping plaza with a few hotels so you often get travelers as well as locals. Both are usually entertaining!   We live closer to two other locations and choose to come her because of the atmosphere.  Food is actually very good. I always get the Southwest Salad with grilled chicken, no ranch dressing extra chimichurri. I am not kidding, it's like my crack, but a healthy option. Haha!  My husband enjoys the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Both are always very fresh and chicken grilled perfectly.  They offer half priced apps daily which are a good to snack on some days.  We really come here because of the staff who are excellent.  From my previous Yelp reviews, it's no surprise that we sit at the bar. The bartenders keep your drinks filled and plates full.. Scully, Robbie, Kim, Morgan.. all awesome!  I am a little sad that Jared left, he was a server, who always brought our food out with a big smile. He truly would brighten your day!  Bob, the manager, is such a team player. He is always doing something to better the restaurant. Lorien is also a manager who is very hands on. She is always out on the floor helping where she can or she will pop out of the kitchen in an apron.  It's clear customer satisfaction is their main priority. If there is ever an issue with food or service management is quick to address it. Give this Applebee's a try and sit at the bar, you won't be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-coventry-2,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
