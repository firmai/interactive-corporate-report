It's located in the middle of the food court right after the security checkpoint (Southwest and US Airways) with a ton of other things.  I had the works pizza (personal pizza size) and a Naked juice... Which came out to be about $16... Ugh. Luckily this was on company dime... Or I would've skipped lunch all together. Then again, this is typical airport pricing... So maybe it's not a big deal. The wait for food was about ten minutes (only redeeming point is that they make it ""fresh""), but the food court it's in is really gross and not cleaned very well... Would not recommend this place unless you were dying of hunger... It's the only quick place that's not absolutely stomach turning in terminal 1. The pizza dough is really gross... Like frozen... isn't really reminiscent of it's better half (a real California Pizza kitchen). I could barely make my way through the whole thing... though it was rather large for a personal pizza.

As expected I was not a great fan of the taste of the Thai chicken. It seemed to have some sort of bland tomato sauce masquerading as a Thai sauce which I felt sucked as it is not difficult to create a simple hot and sweet tomato based sauce that would be more representative of Thai flavor. Anyway they toss a bunch of thinly sliced carrots along with a sprinkling of sprouts to make up for the lack of Thai flavor. They do accept cards but are one of the few restaurants that do not take Amex.

On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything!

Just the right size, however it was a bit pricey at about $19. Fortunately my waitress was pretty good. She was nice and refilled my iced tea when it was getting low. Overall I wouldn't mind eating here again as long as the food remains good, but they probably need to work on their employees and get them to do their jobs instead of checking their phones in the presence of customers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19,2.16,2.33,2.33,2.732,2.2620000000000005

With everything under construction, all of the food options have changed, so CPK it was for me. I wanted something I could grab pretty quickly since my flight was about to board, so I hopped in line for CPK. One good thing about this CPK is that they recognize that people at airports can generally be short on time, so they have pizzas ready made and boxed for you to take on your plane with you. That being said... these pizzas are grossly overpriced (I mean $17+ for a smallish personal pizza??) and clearly have just been chilling under the heat lamps in the boxes for a while.

I swore I wouldn't come again after last time, but I caved, and ended up having a worse experience than the time before. Do not come here unless you have a minimum of an hour to kill. Based on a half dozen or so visits, it always takes over 10 minutes after you're seated for somebody to come by and take your order. If you're ordering an alcoholic drink, expect another 10-20 minutes before that drink arrives. As far as your food, expect it 20-40 minutes after your order. You'll finish your first drink by then, but your server will not come by to ask if you'd like another drink. If you're lucky you can flag them down. Your food will be brought out by somebody who isn't a server, and can't take your order for a second drink.  The food is fine, drinks are good, selection is more than adequate. Service is just so awful that nothing could make up for it. When you mention the delay to your server they complain about how big their section is, a large party of people, or how busy they are. They absolutely never apologize or say anything to put you at ease. When I mentioned the 15 minute wait for my drink order this time I got the busy/large party excuse, and the waitress then the waitress pointed out another person and said they'd been waiting longer. That would be even worse than my 15 minutes, but I specifically saw that table get cleared and that exact person sit down. So it was a blatant lie, and again, no apology or anything to put me at ease. Just lies, excuses, and complaints.  Hopefully I'm never foolish enough to come back here again, but I'm at this airport in this terminal dozens of times a year, and there aren't many options. They kind of know you're stuck with them and act like you're lucky they even serve you at all. It leaves me feeling taken advantage of every time.

I stood in line for 15 mins to order a BBQ Chicken pizza just to have the manager tell me it would take about 10 minutes to be ready, i said fine knowing my plane was about to start boarding in 20 minutes, i waited for about 12 minutes to come ask the other cashier if she has any idea where my pizza is, she said the cook hasn't even made it yet and it will take another 15 mins. I look over to see that the cooks literally haven't even started on the order yet and is making cheese pizza. I waited for 5 more mins after that but still seeing that the pizza isnt being made and they are not in a rush at all, i decided to take the plane cheese pizza instead and head over. The crushed pepper was empty and when I asked the cashier if she has anymore, since this was empty, she seemed like she could care less. The manager was taking orders on the other register and seemed like was in la la land and would rather be at a different place.  Since this location is at the Airport, you would think that they would care for other people's time and try to deliver the order to the customer soon since they have flights to catch but the staff there is just straight up lazy and would rather be elsewhere then work at this CPK.

161,Joe R.,"Huntley, United States",1,99,,1.0,2017-10-08,"Horrible horrible service every time I come here. I swore I wouldn't come again after last time, but I caved, and ended up having a worse experience than the time before. Do not come here unless you have a minimum of an hour to kill. Based on a half dozen or so visits, it always takes over 10 minutes after you're seated for somebody to come by and take your order. If you're ordering an alcoholic drink, expect another 10-20 minutes before that drink arrives. As far as your food, expect it 20-40 minutes after your order. You'll finish your first drink by then, but your server will not come by to ask if you'd like another drink. If you're lucky you can flag them down. Your food will be brought out by somebody who isn't a server, and can't take your order for a second drink.  The food is fine, drinks are good, selection is more than adequate. Service is just so awful that nothing could make up for it. When you mention the delay to your server they complain about how big their section is, a large party of people, or how busy they are. They absolutely never apologize or say anything to put you at ease. When I mentioned the 15 minute wait for my drink order this time I got the busy/large party excuse, and the waitress then the waitress pointed out another person and said they'd been waiting longer. That would be even worse than my 15 minutes, but I specifically saw that table get cleared and that exact person sit down. So it was a blatant lie, and again, no apology or anything to put me at ease. Just lies, excuses, and complaints.  Hopefully I'm never foolish enough to come back here again, but I'm at this airport in this terminal dozens of times a year, and there aren't many options. They kind of know you're stuck with them and act like you're lucky they even serve you at all. It leaves me feeling taken advantage of every time. A simple apology for being so busy would alleviate everything, but they don't care.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19?start=40,2.68,2.63,2.63,,2.6500000000000004

The food was enjoyable. We weren't checked on at all while eating.  We finished eating and sat for roughly an hour before our server finally came back to see how we were doing, he got us boxes but had someone else drop them off and then asked us if we were ready for the bill.
