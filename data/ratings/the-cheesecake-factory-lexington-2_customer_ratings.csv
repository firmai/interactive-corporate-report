71,Brian K.,"Lexington, KY",52,72,99.0,5.0,2014-10-23,"My wife and I were invited to the soft opening tonight.  The food was excellent. The portions were so big that we had to take ""doggie bags"" home.  It was my first visit to this chain.  I'm told this is common for them.  It was a soft opening so there were a few issues so I don't think it is fair to lower my review rating because of them. I highly recommend this restaurant when they open next week. Try the Factory Nachos.  Enough for at least 2 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=60,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.22,3.2200000000000006
35,Laurie A.,"Lexington, KY",11,19,59.0,5.0,2014-10-24,"Finally, Lexington has a Cheesecake Factory!  If you've ever been to the CcF you know how amazing it is. Do I even need to write a review?? I went on one of the training days and even though cooks, bussers, and wait staff were practicing it was the same service and quality that I have come to expect from the CcF.  If you haven't been to a CcF then what are you waiting for? I recommend perusing the menu online beforehand as it is quite extensive. If you're a party of two I would say expect to spend around $50, more if you order drinks, etc. I'd say our average bill is around $75 whenever we go, which wasn't often. Until now! The ambiance is nice, with low light, and even though the place is usually packed with people it somehow doesn't feel crowded. Portion sizes are generous and more than likely you'll be bringing leftovers home with you.  Favorite app: Tex Mex egg rolls. Favorite entrees: Miso Salmon and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Favorite Cheesecake: Red Velvet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
67,William G E.,"Lexington, KY",0,29,18.0,5.0,2014-10-28,"Attended opening night of new store. Of course was crazy as expected. Waited 2hrs but knew I would. Lexington has been craving this forever. A beautiful place like all. The staff very attentive to us. Food awesome  as knew would be. Had a new check in system which I'm not sure of. Took your cell # and text you. Ok I guess but the flashing pager is hard to beet. The hostess girls had to come into crowd and ask out people's names from check in slip. It's a noisy place and you couldn't hear them and they shouldn't have to holler! So maybe need to think over check in. Small problem to fix. Cheesecake Factory is an experience worth the wait. It will do great here, should have been bigger built maybe. Do go and enjoy!! The food selection is wild and amounts real nice!

Totally friendly even though it was a mad house in there! I love the idea of them texting you when your table is ready! They said our table would be ready in 50 minutes and we were seated in exactly 50 minutes! We got an excellent waitress... She made sure we had everything we needed!!! The food was on point too!!! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms small plate!!! I LOVE those mushrooms!!! My husband being the picky eater he is, just got the burger, but he loved it all the same! I got the Chicken Madeira. It was really good! I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory's and have tried alot of items and I will get this again, after I get through the entire 21 page menu :) last but not least, the Cheesecake! I got the Godiva chocolate cheesecake! This is MY cheesecake, from now on, this is all I'm getting!!! It even had chocolate chunks in the Cheesecake!!! Awe man! Delicious!

86,Greg K.,"Winchester, KY",14,63,42.0,3.0,2014-11-16,"Let me start with this. There was 8 of us on a Saturday evening. We got there at 4:52p per the ticket we were given to wait for our table. On the ticket it said 2.5 to 3 hours wait. That was fine. We had shopping to do. They text you when your table is ready which is nice. You have 10 minutes to get back to claim your table. Well 7:52p came around and no text. I went and asked at the hostess stand. They said the times were wrong on the ticket I got. It should've said 3 to 3.5 hours, so they scratched it out and said we'll need to wait. I was not happy. I found a manager and explained what I had been through. He was apologetic and told me we'd be next. Well we weren't. About 35 minutes later we got a table. We sat down around 8:35p. Once we sat down the service was great and so was the food. Make sure when you get there you get the correct wait times written on your ticket otherwise you'll be disappointed like we were. We would've left but everywhere else we called had a 35 to 40 minute wait. That was at 8p.  Bottom line...  Would we go here again?  Yes. Will we wait like we did last time?  No way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=100,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002

It was very busy and crowded. The Cheesecake display was awesome to look at but way to expensive to buy. One would cost from $30 and up. A slice of any of the 30 choices to choice from was $7.95. They had huge menu and in my opinion to many options to pick from. I had the Renee Special which was a turkey sandwich  and a side salad, cream corn soup. This was a huge amount of food for $11. Ice tea cost me $2.95. I choice the Dutch apple and pecan cheesecake huge slice.They even had gluten free section, a skinny selection and breakfeast selection. There was an open bar as well. It was very clean and the staff were very friendly. I would say it would be one of those special occasions for me to go back again for its really costly in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=100,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

27,Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1368,1368,6019.0,2.0,2014-11-24,"This is the smallest Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. Maybe that's a big reason why the wait is always so long. The first time that I attempted to eat at this new location was a weekday around noon. The wait was 90 minutes and I decided that I was too hungry to wait.  Here is my opinion on the wait... if you're going to the mall and will be walking around or shopping for the amount of the wait, then it's not a big deal. What is a big deal and a major annoyance, is when people sign in, and wait at the door and just inside the entrance. Both times that I've been there people are doing just that, like they have no clue that they will text you when your seat is available and you have 10 minutes to get there. Not to mention that they stand and stare at the people dining near the entrance and gawking as the cheesecake is brought from the bakery area. The time that I actually stayed and dined.... there wasn't a separate line for the people who just arriving and were signing in and the ones whose tables were ready. So, the ones whose tables were ready seemed to be rudely cutting line, but it's actually a mismanagement that will hopefully be worked out. When you sign in and give your phone number, they give you a receipt to present once they text you to let you know that your table is ready. That is the only organized part about the check in stand. Otherwise, it seems chaotic even though there were four hostesses, only one was taking the names and phone numbers. Finally, I was seated and my drink order was taken and my soda brought immediately. The weird thing was that the waiter continuously grabbed my soda and took off with it to refill it... every time that it was even remotely near the half way mark. It was annoying because it was literally minutes each time until his return. In all of my days of dining out, this was a first... I've never complained about getting refills... until now.  The menu could use less advertisements and more pictures of entrees... until then, hopefully more people will post entree photos on Yelp ;) The waiter was pretty attentive, except we didn't receive the complimentary bread until our appetizer was brought out and the people at the tables on each side of us, who arrived after us, received their food entrees prior to our appetizer... strange. When we finally received the fried avocado egg rolls, they were excellent, just as the last time that I ordered them, in Miami.  For my entree, I ordered the fish tacos and they came out cold and tasteless. My husband ordered a Jamaican shrimp dish that came out piping hot, so I assume that my meal sat while his was being prepared. After the long wait after ordering, I was looking forward to enjoying my meal... not so much.  The entree prices are a bit steep but the sizes are big. For example, my entree of fish tacos, came with four tacos, beans and rice. Everyone was leaving with leftovers. I ordered the Reese Cup cheesecake and it tasted more like peanut butter fudge than Reese Cup or cheesecake, but highly worth a revisit. All in all, I think that the quirks will eventually be worked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
109,Shelly P.,"Washington, DC",3,29,6.0,3.0,2014-11-25,"Cheesecake Factory (CF)...what were you thinking when you created your chain's smallest restaurant in Lexington, KY at Fayette Mall?  If square footage of available space was an issue, you could have easily made it two stories, but as it stands now, the minimal seating offered isn't half as large as it needs to be. Ahem.   Excellent hosts/hostesses and the waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.  The food is standard for the chain and as always, their cheesecakes out of this world.  However, our family of 4 waited an hour and a half for a table on a Tuesday.  I want to be clear however, this is not the fault of anyone working there--it's the fault of the Cheesecake Factory company for thinking that tiny space was sufficient for a city with a population of this size.   Luckily-- you have the option of roaming the mall as you wait; so my advice is to come early, put down you name, and then do some shopping.  They take your cell number and send you a text message when your table is ready, so you can wander away from the restaurant premises. Having lived in SF, ATL, and DC and been to CF's in each, this one is 1/4 the size of any of those restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

61,Amy W.,"Lexington, KY",135,207,193.0,4.0,2014-12-01,"I have a major sweet tooth, so you know that a restaurant devoted to a rich and sugary dessert would earn my repeated patronage!  I have been to this location twice, but I keep forgetting to check in or take pictures.   The high ceilings, art deco lighting fixtures, and servers dressed in shirts and ties give the ambiance of a nice restaurant.  However, the crowds of people casually dressed reminds you that this is a restaurant attached to the mall.   Expect a long wait until everyone who lives in Fayette and the surrounding counties have had their chance to try it out.  The only upside to the long wait is the fact that you don't have to wait at the restaurant with a buzzer, but can roam the mall and you will receive a text when your table is ready. I have had the fettuccine alfredo at this location.  It was okay, but on the plain side.  On my second visit I had the Factory Nachos with spicy chicken as my entrée.  The portion is huge (like all portions at this chain) and delicious!  The tortilla chips are the real deal (made from tortillas cut up and fried it appears).  The flavors of all of the toppings were just incredible.  I love nachos and these have to be my favorite. As for the real reason why people visit this restaurant: the cheesecake is always perfect!  The first time I had the Snickers cheesecake.  It really tasted like a Snickers bar!  It had that salty peaunuty, chocolatey taste!  The flavor that I tried on my second visit was the S'more cheesecake.  The presentation was pleasing with melted marshmallows and graham crackers on top.  This is my favorite flavor yet.  I can't wait to go back and try the pineapple upside down cheesecake.   If you don't want to be eating the same leftovers for your next three meals then I would recommend stopping by and purchasing a slice of cheesecake without the hassle of waiting to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=60,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997
60,Jason B.,"Roseville, MI",116,278,1285.0,4.0,2014-12-01,Let's just say I've been to the cheesecake factory quite a few times before this one open here in Lexington. For a corporate corporation move chains it's pretty decent you know specially being frozen food. But I always do love the service when you come in to the cheesecake factory always top notch always professional and always courteous and polite. The food is always about average Chino just like any other you know chain that you go to but the cheesecake is always what makes this place the cheesecake factory.

52,Jamie M.,"Lexington, KY",124,212,407.0,5.0,2014-12-03,"I love the cheesecake factory and am so happy we finally got one in Lexington. I've been to the one in Louisville several times. It's usually always busy and some sort of wait so I knew this one would stay that way, not just because it was new, but because of my experience with the on in Louisville. That said, I do agree with others that this one is definitely smaller than the one in Louisville so that will probably cause it to have longer wait times. If you go in expecting the wait then there should be no reason to complain about it. It's a new restaurant and popular and will probably stay that way. Given this, the neat thing is instead of having to sit in the restaurant and wait, they can text you when your table is ready. If you plan around having to wait, you can do some window shopping or actual shopping in the mall and you don't feel like you've wasted your time.  My first visit was on a Saturday about two weeks or so ago. My mom and I were already at the mall early (10amish). We finished our shopping right about 11am so I said lets see how long the wait is. There was a line outside the door, but it was just about 11:05. I think they were trying to seat as they went at first and then decided to check people in and then seat to get the line outside moving. We had about 10-15 minute wait. They texted me when our seat was ready. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Brought the bread out with our drinks and even recommended when we received our meals to go ahead and order the cheesecake if we planned to do so that way we wouldn't have to wait very long for it. Great idea! I had the fish and chips and forgot to take a picture of it. The fish was really light and great flavor. It came with coleslaw and fries. I don't care for coleslaw so I didn't eat that and I failed to ask if I could switch it out with something else. My mom had one of the salads and it looked awesome. The menu can be overwhelming because they have so many options, but the portion sizes are plentiful and most will want a take home box. It is on the pricier side, but it's a great atmosphere. We split the pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecake slice. Wow that was amazing. Like eating pumpkin pie and pecan pie all in one bite.

We bought cheese cake after dinner, he bagged up the wrong ones.  Did he apologize for that, nope.  He said ""they bagged up the wrong ones.""  If you are going to blame someone else for the mistake then I think you should make sure the people you are lying to cannot see you..... just pointing that out.  He was friendly and seemed to try hard but severly lacks customer service.  I have to say I am not sure if I will go back.  The food was good but the service seemed to have most table looking for more.  Food Great and the take home cheese cake was spectacular.  The food is the only reason for the second star.   Time waiting: 55 minutes (estimate 20-30 minutes) Time from seating to check out: 93 minutes (ordered 2 entrees, appetizer that came with entrees, kind of)   Service 0 stars  Food 5 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

Seated in 10 minutes which was great but it took the server 10 minutes to get to us to get a drink order and another 7 minutes to receive it and 20 minutes to just get drinks is really too much for me to deal with especially since the server Tyra C. Had only 3 tables. Refills were a pain to get and had to flag other servers down, once the food arrived at our table our server never check on us to ask us how it was or if anything was wrong which would have been nice since I needed ketchup and my girlfriend had already finished her meal by the time I finally got our server to bring it to our table.

You would think with the seriously long waits the staff would be told to make sure after waiting so long people are taken care of immediately. But they're not. After you get to the table you have to wait forever for someone to wait on you. It's like they don't see you. You may even have to ask for a server. I can't say that it's all really worth it.

I don't like having to read more than a couple pages to figure out what I'm going to eat.  I've had better cheesecake. Perhaps the specialty flavors are better than the plain with strawberries?

I generally don't like them but this one had a fun twist, pineapple. It turned out to be excellent. Kudos to the bar tender!

She never came back out to check if our food was right or good and honestly it wasn't. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was really bad. I've had it before and it was always great before but last night it tasted watery and bland. The chicken was tough and the meal was just not great. When my dinner companion asked for more water, since the server hadn't shown up from the time she took our order till the food was dropped, she asked for my more water and the server literally responded, ""please and thank you"" in the nastiest tone. The child at our table wanted to substitute carrots with his salmon kids meal. The server acted like this was extremely inconvenient and when the food came out she carelessly mentioned that the carrots would be out soon. For some reason I received my food about 6 minutes before anyone else was served. There was no manager walking around to check if we were okay, which is kinda strange for a restaurant.

Having gone to several CCF's around the country I had certain expectations. Quality in nearly all facets has been relatively uniform and above average. However my experience today, whole possibly an outlier, was disappointing. The lunch I ordered was served with what was essentially raw chicken on top. When I brought this to my servers attention she promptly said that she would replace my meal and send the manager over to speak with us about the inadequacy of the meal. After a very lengthy time the replacement meal was brought by another server. This was thankfully cooked, yet we never saw a manager and our initial server was avoiding our table. Later after trying for a while to get the check we finally got our servers attention and she brought the check. A manager was never sent over, nor we were offered anything for our lost time and inconvenience in waiting for a new meal to come out. This was very poorly handled and with a little initiative on the part of the server or the manager she supposedly informed this review could have been avoided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.7600000000000007,2.72
25,Kevin S.,"Lexington, KY",17,17,2.0,3.0,2016-04-19,"I have never felt more indifferently about a restaurant in my life. The Cheesecake factory is the latest major national chain to make its way to Lexington and as such is located conveniently connected to Fayette Mall. It has so so quality of food that is present in all huge chains like this but it is somewhat paradoxically built like a casino buffet in Las Vegas. If Zeus opened an upper middle class restaurant chain, it would look exactly like this, I'm sure. Looking at the menu is an extension of the debate; ""what are we going to eat tonight?"" If you haven't fully made your mind up, just go to the Cheesecake Factory because they're 12 page menu full of nearly every kind of cuisine just short of BBQ (they might have BBQ, I dunno) will certainly give you room to figure it out. It feels odd getting a Cuban sandwich or Jambalaya at an (Italian?) restaurant, but I've done both and can honestly give the Cheese Factory a solid ""meh"". The cheesecake menu is equally robust. I once went to the Coco Cola museum in Atlanta where they had the coke machines from around the world. I'm fairly certain they had less flavor choices than the Cheesecake Factory offers in its deserts. One could try a different cheesecake every night and I'm not sure how many nights that would take but the onset of diabetic comas would make the matter moot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.8280000000000003,2.68

My visit to this particular restaurant was no exception Our waitress was prompt and pleasant, she was answered all of our questions, which was helpful in making decision in the massive menu they offer.  I ordered a Ribeye steak, it was cooked perfectly and did not disappoint... It's not going to replace establishments that I have as my top steakhouses but it held it's own. The steak was complimented by mashed potatoes and French which were both well seasoned and tasted freshly prepared.  I ordered a Mai Tai with my meal which was overall good but was slightly too sweet for my tastes.   I concluded my meal with anniversary cheesecake that had layers of dense chocolate cake and original cheesecake garnished with chocolate mousse and some chocolate drizzle. I am big fan of traditional desserts and this is the perfect hybrid of an original cheesecake and a rich chocolate cake.  This restaurant has many bold flavors and could be overpowering to those who are more attracted to subtle tastes but all the dishes seemed to have good balances of different flavors.

I ordered the basil pasta, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about. Sorta bland. Two people at our table ordered the chicken and biscuits, and they apparently didn't have any ready at the time and had to make (I guess from scratch, since it took so long!). When they finally did come out, they weren't even cooked completely and they had finished most of their meals. The manager gave us a couple of free pieces of cheesecake for the inconvenience, which was cool, but my boyfriend wasn't much impressed with his meal as it lacked gravy and veggies, which are important to the meal!  Appetizer - fried mac and cheese, was the bomb as always. And cheesecake, which we got to go, was of course good - they better not mess that up, right?

I decided to navigate the 21 page menu by myself. I settled on ordering the calamari and macaroni.  The calamari was over breaded and over fried, which is usually a sign of tough, unmassaged squid. The two sauces it came with were good and covered up the tasteless sea food.  The macaroni was brought out in a cast iron dish. The top was crisp and warm, like all good, country macaroni should be, but underneath it was an ocean of too milky creme. The cheese sauce that usually adds to the macaroni drowned it out and I was disappointed after hearing all the hoopla. What saves Cheesecake Factory is its fish tacos. My sisters birthday was the other day and of course she picked this restaurant. I decided upon the fish tacos with white rice and beans. The fish was panko fried and the sauce they paired it with was excellent. Chopped pepper, avocado and onion brought it all together nicely.

I recommend to look up the menu before you get to the restaurant so you have an idea what you want to order before the waiter gets to the table. Otherwise you might have to wait a little for him to come back. It is a very big menu. Take a look at the menu and prices:     If you download the app you can see pictures. That was very helpful. The food is really tasty. Love the Crispy Cuban Rolls and the chicken wings.

We can't afford it often, so it's a really special treat for us to just get some cheesecake to go. Went in last Saturday evening, and ordered two pieces of cheesecake in the to-go line. One of the Coffee and Cream Cheesecake, and one of the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Coffee for husband, and white chocolate for me. His was awesome, however, when I got to mine I noticed it was sort of short, if that makes sense. I took a bite, and realized there was no crust in that bite. (LOVE the chocolate cookie crust, makes the cheesecake a little less rich). Took another bite, and didn't have any crust in it... so I lifted the whole piece up and realized there was no crust until you got to the back of the cheesecake- like someone had lifted it and the bottom hadn't come with it. That's not a huge deal- but when you're spending $8 on a piece of cheesecake that you allow yourself once or twice a year, it was super disappointing. Had already been out all day and didn't feel like being that girl to bring back a half-eaten piece of cheesecake for a possible refund. So I just let it be- but I was definitely disappointed I only got part of what I paid for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

I ordered chips and guac, 6 year old ordered the mini corn dogs, one adult ordered steak medallions and one the steak tacos. I ordered the blood orange martini and there was ZERO alcohol in it. NONE!It was a syrupy mix with a slice of orange in it. The portion of guac and chips was large but had zero taste to it. I ate about 3 bits and quit, wasnt even worth chewing. The chips were to salty and hard as a rock. The one who ordered the steak tacos received chicken instead of steak, had to be replaced. The one with the steak medallions said her order was fine. The 6 year old was in tears when he saw what they considered to be a mini corn dog. There was no way any child could bite that monster of dough it was actually disgusting.

Finally, the southwest ones arrived but at that point we were just ready to go because we had been there for two hours.  During the visit, I noticed they do Sunday brunch. My hubby and I have it a try a few weeks later. Service was on par, not great. I ordered eggs benedict, and asked the waitress how their poached eggs were turning out. She said perfect since a corporate chef was there doing some training. Food arrives, and the eggs are not poached medium like I requested. So the waitress sent the entire plate back. Joe's don't eating by the time my food arrives. This time, poached hard. They were done, so I ate them but I was not surprised at that point it was messed up.  If you go, just order cheesecake to go.

He never acknowledged that we were there until he got off the phone... he said two? And turned around and started walking. We followed him without knowing if we were supposed to or not. He took us to a table laid menus and said nothing. All that was ever said to us was one word ... ""two."" We sat there for another few minutes until our server showed up and wanted to know if we wanted bread? We said yes thinking he might ask about drinks or apps to buy no he walked away, I'm assuming to get bread. After about another 5 minutes he showed up  with bread. Then we ordered drinks and before he walked away I said we want to complete our order. We did place our order and immediately received our drinks. We were not so fortunate with our food. No waiter and no food for 20 to 25 minutes. My wife ordered Monte Cristo and I ordered the French toast with bacon and added potatoes. Our entrees showed up after around 30 minutes by I did not get potatoes or bacon. The food runner who dropped off our food said enjoy. I told her I was still missing food. She sighed and said ""OK."" She came back a couple minutes later with potatoes but no bacon and this time got away before I could get her attention. Still hadn't seen my original server... suddenly my server showed up and wanted to know how all was. I said I was missing bacon. He looked at me and ""yes I think you might have ordered bacon with that. "" It took a few but I got my bacon and all my order at the table. The Monte Christo and French Toast were good but the bacon I had worked so hard to get had obviously been cooked and kept in a warming drawer for hours and wasn't good. After I finished my food I told my wife that I was going to stack all the dishes up at the end of the table and see if that gets them removed. Many servers, managers, hosts and what looked like cooks passed but the leaning tower of Piza remained until our waiter finally came back.

Whether dining in or getting cheesecake to go the menu is huge! The dine-in menu seems very Guy Fieri inspired, what with its cheddar blasted wasabi infused pretzel bites and beer battered ginger glazed egg roll nibblers. However, i am always able to find something goon the menu.  This time in particular we got cheesecake to-go. Of course there are so many to choose from. There's always the option of taking home a 6-inch regular cheesecake, which is big enough to satisfy even the biggest size queen. However, whenever I go my strategy is to pick one chocolate type cheesecake and a non-chocolate cheesecake.  The first slice I got was Oreo cheesecake. To say it was rich is an understatement. It featured chocolate ganache, a cheesecake layer, Oreo cookies inside and a base layer of chocolate cake. Of course it was delicious and enough for 2 or 3 people to share. A lesser man would have stopped there, but not me. I decided to get another slice. This time the celebration cheesecake. It has cheesecake, birthday cake layers, strawberry and vanilla flavoured mousse and a blue frosting layer as well. Very delicious and rich. I'm going to enjoy this slice in two sittings.
