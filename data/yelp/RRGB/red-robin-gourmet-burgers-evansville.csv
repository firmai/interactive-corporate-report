Rebekah W.,"Newburgh, IN",0,5,1,2.0,7/17/2015,"Overpriced.  The 2 chicken entrees were dried out.  Definitely not worth the $.  My salad was supposed to be a bbq whiskey chicken breast... No bbq sauce, no croutons, no avocado!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20

Kelly H.,"Alton, IL",2,3,,1.0,3/22/2015,"My family and I went in. We looked around, there were employees everywhere, but no one greeted us. So I saw a booth in the corner and we walked to it and sat down. Within seconds, we were greeted by a less than friendly server, who said she would be with us in a moment. When someone finally came, they asked if we wanted drinks or apps. I said we don't have menus. She said oh no one gave you menus. I said no one said anything when we walked in, so we seated ourselves. There was no sign, and obviously we weren't important enough to greet. She said okay hold on a second. She walked to the hostess station, and within thirty seconds, the hostess came over and rudely told us we shouldn't seat ourselves, and threw down menus. I said that's fine, we are leaving. I asked for the manager, and he justified it by saying we didn't know what was going on. I said your hostesses should greet incoming people. I also said where is the sign that says please wait to be seated. How are you going to correct a paying customer? The girls that worked there looked like they didn't want us as a customer. If you don't want my money, I'll go somewhere else. We went to Crazy Buffet in Evansville instead, spent 55 dollars and left an 11 dollar tip. The service and food were great at crazy buffet. I'm glad someone cares about their customers. I posted my trouble on facebook and multiple people also commented that they were treated terribly there as well. Do not visit this restaurant!! Show them we don't need their unfriendly business practices in our town!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Allen B.,"Washington, IN",2,3,,5.0,9/12/2012,Great service and good pizza.  Arrived a little after 4pm and they still let us order off lunch menu. Will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Jay B.,"Brazil, IN",3,167,66,4.0,3/7/2012,"Loved my Bacon Guacamole burger!  My milk shake as also excellent.  My only hang ups were the price and the service.  Weekday lunch, only 10 or 15 other people in the place, almost empty, but our food took almost 30 minutes.  Prices are a little high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Nolie P.,"West Lafayette, IN",1,30,3,4.0,10/30/2013,4 stars when comparing to other burger joints. Fantastic burgers- juicy and cooked perfectly. My kids loved the unlimited fries and I liked the fact I could sub a salad for my fries at no extra charge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Keith G.,"Marietta, GA",7,23,10,2.0,7/24/2011,I have seen the commercials for a while. Finally able to stop in and was extremely let down. Don't call yourself a gourmet burger joint if you use what taste like frozen patties. The meat flavor reminded of Burger King.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Fred W.,"Calhoun, KY",14,30,16,5.0,6/11/2011,"Got the Bleu cheese burger. Everything was great. The onion straws on the bottom of the burger were a little much, but other than that a great burger!

Louis F.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,3.0,9/28/2013,Food was great but it took forever for anyone to welcome us or to be seated. The hostess just stood with their back to everyone coming in,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Brandie M.,"Evansville, IN",2,19,,4.0,2/27/2011,"We love Red Robin! Always good service, great food and a nice atmosphere! Try the fried jalapenos! French Onion soup and all the salads are very good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Maddie W.,"Evansville, IN",0,71,44,2.0,1/3/2011,"We decided to try the carryout from here after hearing from friends that any of the burgers on the menu could be made with a veggie patty instead of the beef.  I decided to try the Burnin' love burger, which is topped with fried jalapenos, pepper jack and salsa.  My boyfriend decided on the Garden burger, which is topped with your standard burger toppings.  They both had veggie patties instead of the beef patty, and both were very large, I could barely bite into mine.  He was happy with his burger, but the veggie patty on mine was really limp and almost slimy, and definitely hadn't been cooked long enough.  The toppings were good, so I ended up giving the veggie patty to my dogs and eating the burger without it.  The order of fries that came with each sandwich were massive, I couldn't even eat close to half of them.  At almost $10 each, I thought the burgers were a little high for this area, and I'm not sure we will be coming back to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville?start=20
Rachel W.,"Des Plaines, IL",94,590,1474,4.0,12/18/2017,"Four of us dined here about 7pm on a Saturday night. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. This was a bummer because tables just weren't being cleared quick enough, thus the longer wait. Our waitress was friendly and the appetizers & entrees arrived relatively quickly. Everything was tasty and I'd reorder (the large order of onion rings next time!) everything I ate should I try Red Robin again: Recommend if you're looking for a reasonably priced menu with huge variety. Big parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Todd G.,"Evansville, IN",0,23,3,2.0,11/12/2017,"First, the food here is great but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered a glass of wine and the glass brought out was dirty and had lipstick on it.  We ordered the Tavern Double Burger with endless fries and Chicken Salad Platter.  The food was excellent.  The Burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were crisp.  The salad was wonderful.  However, my drink glass sat empty for the first half of the meal and when asked for a second round of endless fries they never came.  We pretty much ate all our food and were just sitting here.  It was about 15 minutes when we got the fries.   If I rated this for food only it would be a 4.  The service needs a boost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Claire P.,"Cadiz, KY",0,13,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Food was good, but the wait was ridiculous. It's a Friday, during the holidays, the parking lot wasn't even half-way full and we had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. The hostesses didn't ask if we wanted a table or a booth and put us at a high top, which due to an injury I can't sit at them. When my guest and I stopped, my guest said, ""Is this okay? I said, ""Well I don't want to wait another 20 minutes..."" and the hostess never offered to move us to the empty booth two feet away. After our server came up we asked to move and she said it was no problem. I was really disappointed in the server and the hostesses, the wait staff and the food are the only reason I gave them one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville

Joe R.,"Newburgh, IN",0,10,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Service great.  Clam Chowder was thin, watery & tasteless.  The garlic toast was burned. Burgers are probably good. Just guessing though.

Blaise W.,"Owensboro, KY",33,117,112,4.0,3/15/2017,Came by this past Sunday at around noonish and it was starting to get busy. We were in and out within an hour so not bad for party of 4 on a busy sunday lunch hour with the SEC Championship game going on on top of that. I broke tradition and got a bacon cheese burger instead of a Royal Red Robin or a bonzai  burger. We LOVE their Freckled Lemonade! even got some to go as well. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Anna W.,"Evansville, IN",0,5,,5.0,10/2/2016,"We ate at Red Robin on a Sunday right after they opened. Got right in, sat in the bar. Service was excellent! Burgers were good and really like getting a choice of dipping sauces for the bottomless fries. We were offered a to-go for our drinks, which we accepted. Good experience! Will definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Ardis B.,"Fairfield, IL",24,103,59,5.0,9/18/2016,"We had a wonderful dinner here. The atmosphere is fun and the restaurant and restrooms are very clean. Our service was great and the food was delicious pious as well. I really like how Red Robbin gives so many ""bottomless"" options. Free refills on fries and some specialty drinks is a great bonus!  The waiting area also has some games for kids to play if you come during a busy time and have to wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Chris B.,"Evansville, IN",0,8,2,4.0,4/26/2016,"Yes, people think the burgers are over priced, I did too once. But then I did the math, for the price you pay you are getting an absolutely awesome meal. The Pig Out Double Tavern Burger is to die for!! The fries are delicious!! The service has always been wonderful. My only problem is, I could eat there every day! A great way to get more value out of the deal is to join the rewards program. Free burger after 10 visits, percent off deals, and other options make it a great way to save.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville

Joseph W.,"Owensboro, KY",0,23,1,2.0,12/20/2015,$10 Burgers that look and taste straight outta Burger King! Gourmet burger really? Waitresses not caring about tables because of new touch screen table system for appetizers and check pay cutting into tips.

Debbie M.,"Newburgh, IN",11,81,164,4.0,8/17/2014,"My husband and I stopped in so we could see the end of the Nascar race.  There are several tv's and they were all on the race.  I hadn't been here since they opened.  We got their smallest burger, which is 2 thin patties. It included endless fries.  The burger was just the right size.  We also shared a clam chowder which was very good.  We will come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Nikki C.,"Vincennes, IN",41,28,18,4.0,4/11/2015,"So, I need to update this. I have this location another shot with some friends, and it was night and day with my previous experience. We had a great server this time that was more than willing to deliver a good service. I ordered the guacamole burger, and it was good. The burgers have a very fresh from the grill taste. They absolutely reminded me of summer time and barbecues. Even though my first experience was a bad one, I'm glad I gave it another shot. Hopefully it stays that way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Dietrich D.,"Little Rock, AR",25,60,34,3.0,1/3/2014,"We came to Red Robin having never experienced what surely must be a great burger, being as we are bombarded by their advertisements in our home town and we don't even have a RR. I ordered an A1 peppercorn burger, my wife a fish and chips, and my kids both got kids meals.  We also got a tower of onion rings as an app and 2 beverages. Total:  $52. While my kids enjoyed their meals and my wife seemed to enjoy hers, I failed to see what the hype of this place is.  My burger, for which they pride themselves, was dry and tasted no better than something you would get at your local tavern.  The sauce was ok (A1 peppercorn sauce), but thats it.  It was small and wasn't worth the $11 they charged for it. The service was great, but nothing about the food was spectacular.  Save your money and hit up one of the other chains on this street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Todd L.,"Evansville, IN",0,11,2,3.0,11/1/2014,"11-1-14:  We arrived and were seated quickly.  Placed our orders and the food arrived within about 10 minutes.  One order was correct.  The waitress was gone before I realized my order was incorrect (ordered plain with no mayo/tomato).  Summoned waitress back and she brought the replacement within minutes.  This order also had mayo.  Had to re-summon her.  A few minutes later the manager arrived and brought me a plate of French fries.  The manager, Marcus, said my order would not be charged.  He delivered my correct order within a few minutes.   1 star for ordering efficiency and correctness. 2 stars for the waitress who didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked (well, medium, etc), or wait any length of time to determine if the order was correct. 5 starts for customer service.  The manager made it right.  His actions will result in me returning to this establishment.  HIS attitude made the difference and was appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Janet B.,"Xenia, IL",0,8,,4.0,1/31/2016,"Had a great lunch here. The food was good and also the service. My salad was very good and fresh! The only problem we had is they offered the kids fancy lemonade drinks, but failed to tell us their was an upcharge for them. The manager offered to removed them from our bill. Also, if you like to limit screen time for kids, this place has the video game machines, so you may want to hide them. Overall, we liked it and would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Pam S.,"Henderson, KY",1,57,,4.0,10/22/2015,"This is a good place if you are looking for a messy, overloaded burger.  The pig-out burger is great as are the onion rings.  I also like the bacon aioli and sweet potato fries.  The atmosphere is pretty much like all these types of chain restaurants which is fine.  I haven't decided whether I like the addition of the devices at each table where you can order certain things and pay but that might be just because I don't like a lot of extra stuff taking up space on the table.  When I want a ""guilty"" burger this is where I go cause they are delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
Jeff N.,"Evansville, IN",0,35,4,3.0,10/30/2012,We stopped in for a quick burger while out getting ready for a halloween party on sunday.  45 minutes later we were still waiting for our order.  Our wait person seemed really busy but from all outward appearances she only had 3 tables to wait on. Food was good though.  I just wish we had more time to enjoy it.  We ended up being in the restaurant for about 1 hour and 15 minutes for something that usually takes about 20-25 minutes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evansville
