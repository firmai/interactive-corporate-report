41,Jessica B.,"Memphis, TN",0,8,,2.0,2012-03-21,"Food is good. Service not so good. Last two times I went I sat in the bar area, which is not a good idea. First time, the waitress just wouldn't ever come back. She took our drink order, then 15 minutes finally came back to get our food order. Food came out in a timely manner, with the exception of dessert. We got one of those 2 for $10.99 ( or whatever the price is) deals where we ordered a entree and had the option of a starter or dessert. Well we chose dessert and apparently you have to decide your dessert right then. Which would make you think it would be a no brainer to get the dessert out. Nope, finished the food and finally 15 minutes later the dessert came out.  During this time we never saw our waitress. Took her forever to get our check (after we had to stop her to ask her for it) and then forever to come back to get our payment.  The second time was worse. I was meeting a friend and I got their first. Waiter came up and took my drink order. A few minutes later my friend arrived and it took him about 10 minutes to come back to get her drink. Then after that took him about 15 more minutes to come back to get our order. After this, never saw him again. Well, take that back, we saw him...at the bar, at other tables, at every other table except ours. Finally we pulled someone aside and said we can please get more drinks and our check. My friend was supposed to get a dessert and she just told them to forget about it. The person that finally helped us was really nice and did everything in a timely manner. I hope he was the one who actually got the tip I left. Only reason I gave them two stars is because I do actually like their food. Not sure if the bad service only occurs at the bar, but I am not willing to find out by making a different trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.6080000000000003
43,Stephen O.,"Memphis, TN",119,58,7.0,1.0,2012-04-16,"Five words: ""back on the ban list"".  I gave TGI Friday's another shot this past weekend, after more than a year and a half of avoiding them even when friends have pushed the agenda pretty hard. For the sake of fellowship, I gave them one more shot. Surely they have to be doing something right, after all they stay busy... right? Right?  Not so much. In the past I have had food that tasted good at TGI Fridays, but terrible service. This time, the experience was pretty much bad all around. I am not going to speak about the wait because it was a Saturday night and I expect to have to wait to get a table for seven people. That being said, when we finally were sat it took our server a few minutes to show up and greet us. Once we were greeted, we put in our drink orders and appetizer orders. Our drinks were brought, but our food order was delayed a few minutes until our appetizers arrived, as our server was busy. I ordered a appetizer combo platter to share, and it was the best thing about my entire meal.  It came out reasonably quickly, and the food was well prepared and generously portioned for the price. You have just heard me say the last good thing about this experience. After ordering our entrees, it was about 27 minutes later and we did not have our food. Conversation had reached a lull, and every table around us had food, so we were curious what was going on. It was then that my friend spotted our server at the computer, talking to a manager. He had forgotten to put our food order in. For almost a half hour.  Of course, he did not tell us this, but it was confirmed by the fact it took another 25 minutes or so before our food came out. The manager knew what had happened, but he did not offer to comp our appetizers or in any way apologize for the horrendous delay and bad experience.  On top of all of that, my ribs had no sauce on them and were the least meaty ribs I have ever had in my life. I could go on, but no one was blown away by their food. It was mediocre at best (mine was lousy) and when we left we all agreed we would not be back.  The next time friends tell me they are going to TGI Fridays, my response will be ""you guys have fun"". I am done with this establishment for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005
39,Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5.0,3.0,2012-06-22,"If you'd asked me to review this place a week ago, I would've given it one star. Why the upgrade? I don't know when they added the new menu items, but I'm so glad they did. The menu seemed to stay the same for years and got very stale. Aside from the stuff on the Jack Daniel's menu, everything else was very bland and generic. Chicken tenders? Fried shrimp? Gee, can't get those things anywhere else. The food is better now. There's some new items. I've only tried the fusion chicken skewers (available in either Japanese hibachi or Mediterranean). They're also available in steak, if that floats your boat. The hibachi flavour is basically a Japanese barbecue kinda flavour with miso and sesame seeds (the sauce for dipping is the same as the marinade); the Mediterranean is a lemon garlic marinade with tzatziki sauce. They're both so good, though I prefer the Mediterranean. Both are served with pita bread (sooo yummy) and two sides. The service still sucks, though. And the atmosphere in the place is just...blah. If you go during the day it's dead and you have to put up with noisy kids. If you go at night it's crawling with people there to drink so you have to put up with noisy adults. You can luck out in the afternoon though and maybe there won't be any kids, but usually when it's that dead, the service is even worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=20,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000004

31,Jonathan S.,"Jeffersonville, IN",0,16,1.0,1.0,2014-10-08,This place was extremely disappointing on the two occasions that I went there. On the most recent visit my wife and I waited at the hostess stand for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging that we were there leading to us walking out. The first time we were there we also ended up walking out after being seated and nobody coming to our table for a good 15 minutes.  It's a real shame because this place is giving the TGI Fridays name a bad wrap. It is obviously an issue with the management and employees at this particular location. I would not advise anyone to ever go here! I would like to preface this by stating that I have literally never walked out of a restaurant before and I did if here both times that I went...I should not have given them a second chance.

We were promptly greeted and sat right away. We reviewed the menu and made our selections, and began to look around...there were about 8 other tables, all had their food. A manager even quickly ran by the table and said, ""thanks for coming in!"" Without checking to see if we had drinks or had been waited on. We waited a total of 20 minutes and finally decided to leave. I wandered to the area where the manager went to and found 3 workers sitting around and cutting up with the manger.

21,Jaime T.,"Memphis, TN",210,29,4.0,1.0,2015-07-26,"My husband and I are major Friday's lovers so after living overseas for 3 years, we were very excited to find one in our new place of residence. Upon walking into the restaurant, I noted that despite the ""wait"", there were several tables throughout the restaurant that were open, ready to be used by incoming patrons. However, having many years of previous experience in the restaurant business, I also knew this might be due to the few larger parties seated.  Once we sat down, it took a longer length of time then was appropriate for our server to come over. He took our drink order and asked if we wanted anything else at the time. I ordered an appetizer and asked for a few more minutes on our entrees when he proceeded to again ask us if we wanted anything else. I repeated myself and he walked away. 10 minutes later, he came back for the rest of our order when we delivered our drinks.  15 minutes after our drinks were delivered, my husband stopped the server to ask about our appetizer to which he replied would be out soon. 10 minutes later, it finally arrived at our table. Despite the delay, they were very fresh and tasted good.  About 20-25 minutes after our app was delivered, our food was delivered. My children's food had obviously been under the warmer for an extended amount of time considering the pasta was literally crispy and the burgers were dried out. The chicken on my salad was cooked well but was cold. One of the most aggravating moments was when we asked for cheese for my daughter's pasta. Our server left and came back to bring something to a table next to ours twice before I reminded him about the cheese. He then brought my husband a lemonade refill that was not asked for and still no cheese. He finally brought back out the cheese almost 20 minutes after we asked for it.  When it came time for our check, the server was no where to be found. When he finally showed up, not only did he smell like an ashtray having obviously finished a cigarette break but he brought out check that indicated he put in my husband's order incorrectly by putting in the more expensive entree instead of the actual entree he ordered. We did not know this due to our lack of visiting Fridays over the last three years. In my opinion, it was shady or lack of caring about knowing your job. Either way, when I asked if I could speak to a manager, the server said he would try to find them. At that point, considering the extended time everything else took and our two small children being done with the situation, we decided to leave.  I am truly disappointed in the incompetency of the server, the uncleaniness of the restaurant and the general lacking of giving a damn by any employee in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

27,Chealsy L.,"Memphis, TN",15,90,59.0,3.0,2016-03-03,"I'm not brave enough to update to a five star simply, because one good visit doesn't wipe their slate with me. It always seems my friends or coworkers want to go here and of course I tag along. So I wasn't particularly excited about going again, even though I love the Jack Daniels Burger. This last time was actually pretty outstanding! Our servers name was either John or Josh, but he was awesome. My drinks were made right, my food came out right and in the right order. He had a great personality, the place has been remodeled and they updated their music playlist. The manager is new and so is the rest of the staff. Maybe all of the scathing reviews finally got through to them. I'm not promise you'll have a great experience simply, because there has been so many bad ones at this specific location. However, I will say I'm at least willing to go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=20,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
23,Lakesha T.,"Cordova, TN",1,11,10.0,1.0,2016-03-27,If I could give this location 0 stars I would. We went on a Wednesday night with a large party. The long wait was expected but the rude and utter disrespectful demeanor of both management and the wait staff was appalling like we were an inconvience. After 2 hours of waiting and everyone in the party getting food. My husband and I still had no food while others were getting round 2 of their endless apeteizers and we only ordered a 3 for all appetizer.

10,Crystal P.,"Philadelphia, PA",40,26,2.0,1.0,2017-07-02,"You know I don't expect much from Fridays, but this place is just BAD. The two servers in the bar area just kept walking past us, even one girl (short hair cut with a side part) looked at us and didn't even have the decency to say ""someone will be right with you"". I had to go to the bar twice to have someone come to my table. 30 minutes later, we finally had a server come by after she had a nice laugh and conversation with her friends. I asked for pot stickers and she said that they can't make them...so fine I just ordered the mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. While we waited for our food, I saw about 5 orders of pot stickers come out....but I was told that they can't make them. No napkins were given to us and basically never saw my server.

She was new and did not know the menu very well. But I enjoy newly hired servers, they are genuinely nice and eager. The bad review rating is for the food not the service. We had to send a steak back. It was cooked well done instead of med well and it was the wrong cut of steak. One of my sides arrived after the reordered 2nd steak arrived. The food tasted basic will no seasoning. I never once saw a manager walking the floor within our 2 hour visit. This is not the Friday's I remember.

0,Chelsea H.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",32,3,2.0,5.0,2018-01-06,"Look, I get it. Maybe service is not the absolute best, but it's not utter crap either. Our server was lovely. There was a bit of a wait for clearly open tables, but nothing overwhelming. I can imagine at peak hours it can be burdensome.  My husband and I came here today with purpose. We heard the Beyond Meat Burger was available at TGI Fridays nationwide. And it did not disappoint!!  The 6 oz vegan patty is seasoned, cooked, and served up with an assortment of toppings. We are vegetarian, so we left the white cheddar and buttered bun that TGIF served it up with, but it can be skipped for vegans. If you've tried the Beyond Burger at home (4 oz patty), you haven't tried this restaurant version. I had nearly forgotten what it was like to feel full from a hearty restaurant burger.  You can rest assured we will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
