Jamie M.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",39,365,240,3.0,4/7/2010,"Located on the not so hotspot of Newport road, this isn't the most glamorous of TGI's you'll find, especially as there is one opening up very soon at St. Davids 2. First off, your generally going to need a car to get here and is far enough away from town that if your a visitor, your not going to want to deviate that far away. It was quite busy the night we went and was put on an alleyway towards the kitchen, making us feel slightly out of the the loop with the other customers. Food wise I normally really like TGI's food, but whether it was because I was feeling rough that day or not, I really wasn't happy with the food that day. I went with a classic burger which is fairly big that comes with fries. However it felt a little on the cold side and wasn't as good as I've had before. The service was ok and despite the poor waitress being rushed off her feet she did take time to refill our drinks a lot and kept a smile on the whole time.  We weren't in their for long tbh and fairly glad of it. I was just left with the unsatisfying feeling that I expected a little more than what I got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff-3

Sarah P.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",14,620,614,4.0,4/3/2010,"TGI Fridays is everything you could possibly expect it to be loud, busy, and very American, but don't I love it for it! The food is your typical, burgers, fries, potato skins etc... You could certainly have a heart attack if you ate here regularly. It's a relatively big Fridays, but don't be surprised if it's already full when you arrive, as it's very popular. The staff in particular are excellent, and really keep the atmosphere alive, and be sure to check out the barmen, who are famous for their tricks (they've even won competitions)! The only slightly off thing about this Fridays is its weird location, but they are opening in the more convenient St Davids 2 this summer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff-3
Cheryl B.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2,21,,2.0,5/19/2010,"Pros - Good(ish) cocktails. Friendly staff trained to be attentive like American waiting staff. Cons - Overpriced. SMALL portions. Too loud. Too many kids parties. Worst quesadilla I've had in my whole life, it was full of onion and hardly any chicken. I never choose to go there, usually I go with a group of friends and don't want to be a pain and say I don't want to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff-3
