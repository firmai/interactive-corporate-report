Sam K.,"Chicago, IL",96,6,3,5.0,10/26/2017,"THEY HAVE A 12.99 RIB SPECIAL. Full slab of ribs, 2 sides. They come BBQ or bacon crusted bbq. How is that not 5/5 stars. The service was good. They forgot to take off $8 for free app special I got online but that's okay, still got an awesome rib special. Been there twice for the ribs already, will be back another 2 times within the next week. Worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park
Tim V.,"Evergreen Park, IL",1,10,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"This was one of the top 3 worst dining experiences ever. First we were seated at some weirdly designed ""Quarter-booth"" that was insanely uncomfortable. The place was packed so I elected to just stay put. So....finally our server shows up to take our drink order. We decided to not drink any booze and instead, ordered simple soft drinks. They couldn't even get that right. My drink was absolutely horrible! ITS POP, PEOPLE! How do you screw up pop? Lastly, as we finished our entrees, I noticed that our appetizer plates were still on the table.  Totally disorganized!  Terribly disappointed! The single star that I clicked on is unfortunately required in order to write/post a review. If it were not, trust me, I would have left the equivalent of a negative star! This experience has prompted me to no longer patronize this TGIFridays in particular but TGIFridays chain altogether.

Tracy G.,"Orland Park, IL",92,12,2,1.0,11/19/2017,"If I could give zero starts I would. Do NOT waste a dime at this place.  FIRST, The restaurant is dirty. The staff is not exactly rude but not very friendly at all. The tables are so tiny you feel super crammed. Then let's talk about the food ,if you can even call it that! It was NOT edible. We ordered a pretzel appetizer. It was burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. The cheese sauce was gross tasting. We went with our two kids. I ordered Jack Daniels chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The best comparison I can give it, is that of a microwave budget meal from the frozen food section but it wasn't even THAT good. Because it tasted like it had been nuked a few times and then refrigerated again. The mashed potatoes were room temp and the broccoli was not only cold but brown! My husband got the ribs. They were a funny gray color and smothered in the bland bbq sauce. My kids both ordered the mini cheeseburgers with fries. Both meals came with two and at the end of the meal they both still had two on their plate. My one sons were dry as burnt like hockey pucks. When he took a bite he started to chew and gagged and spit it out onto his plate. My other child's burgers were gray and rubbery. He also took one or two bites and didn't like it at all. And they didn't even like the fries which were also, not hot.  After waiting forever for our check, the server asked if we wanted boxes. We said no. He simply said ok and walked away. Clearly had no interested in seeing why NONE of us ate any of our food. In addition to the horrible taste, there were little flies all over the restaurant. They kept lending on our food! The bathroom had no lock on the stall, toilet paper everywhere and trash all over the counter and floor. It was Sunday night and not at all busy so there is no reason for it to be so dirty, not that there ever is a reason! Now, it's been three hours and we all feel sick from the few bites of food we did eat. Probably the uncooked dough in the pretzels. To top this off, my husband and I drank water, and our bill was 55 bucks! Could have spent 5 on microwave dinners and at least had hot food without the bugs! NASTY! Do NOT go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park
Adam B.,"Oak Forest, IL",24,19,5,1.0,6/25/2017,"Highly recommend staying away from this place, I know we will never go Back! They overcharged us for bad cold food that takes forever to come out.. and that is assuming they get your order right. Food Quality: 2/5 - The chicken we ordered was very hard and dry. The burgers and fries were cold.  The only good things that we had (group of 8) were the apps (spinach cheese dip and buffalo wings). Note: I still haven't me tioned the fact that they didn't bring out one of our burgers until we had already finished all our other food, but that will be in ""Service"". Even the Dr. Pepper was bad (something about the syrup) and they just assumed that coke would be an acceptable solution (we didn't make a fuss about this at the time). Service 1/5 We had a party of 8 and warned asked the server why he wasn't writing any of our orders down a d he indicated that he memorized it...well, he didn't. We got everyone's food after what felt like an eternity (most of which was cold already) and then he indicated that the last member of our party would have his food in a few seconds. After  waiting 20 minutes, the server never returned! We went up to the host to inform him of the situation and that at this point, we don't need the last order since everyone shared their COLD food with our unfortunate friend and we were all already done with our meals. The server came back because we asked someone for our check (still had to wait for that) and the waiter had the audacity to bring the burger with the check !!! On top of that we were charged full price even though we even had a coupon for a free appetizer!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park

Douglas K.,"Tinley Park, IL",13,195,47,3.0,7/24/2016,"This location experience was okay with an overall 3 star rating.  The food seemed to be delivered in a reasonable time frame.  We were seated in the bar section at a high top booth.  The service was okay and we interacted with 3 workers who all seemed happy to serve us. The food was okay as we ordered a mozz stick appetizer, jack daniel's burger, and the shrimp and chicken skillet.  The mozzarella sticks were good but generally over priced.  The burger was cooked well and very juicy.  The shrimp and chicken skillet was okay to undesireable.  We did not see any part of the dish that was standout.  Overall the dishes were what we expect from a place such as a TGI fridays.   Why 3 stars?  Well the food was nothing more than we expect from a place such as a TGI Fridays, Applebees, or Chiles.  Maybe a bit better would bring us back to this location.  We are not picky about where we sit but sometimes it would be nice to be spread out where customers are sat.  We were put right in the middle of two other couples.  There were plenty of places around the room that were open.  Not sure if this is done based on servers or just the hostess planning?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park
Mia K.,"Orland Park, IL",42,3,,3.0,5/16/2017,"*this review is solely based on quality of service and not food as chain restaurants are all very similar  I have been to this location twice in the last week ($10 endless appetizers all the way) and the quality of service varied greatly.     The first time I went was a Saturday night around 10 pm with a group of music students after a performance and the service and speed was excellent. It is always very appreciated when the waitstaff and servers do not belittle a younger group of customers and I was very pleased with my experience.  Being so impressed with their service, I decided to take the badminton team to dinner on a Monday evening around 4 pm and unfortunately was very displeased by the service. The waitstaff had very little patience and was very slowly considering we were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 45 minutes to prepare appetizers and when the wait time was roughly 10 minutes the first time I visited with a larger group and during a busy hour. TGIF prices are a little much for their worth, however local locations have no control over such factors. The service is a hit or miss when visiting and it is disappointing to have such varying experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park

Toni S.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,,1.0,6/17/2017,"Ordered 3 burgers, all of which had bacon.  2 out of the three burgers had RAW bacon on them (how dangerous), like not slightly undercooked, BUT basically RAW.  The waiter said, ""do you want me to have them cook the bacon"", are you slow? The raw bacon has been sitting on my burger, no thank you, please remake and keep the bacon.  Manager didn't apologize, and didn't credit back the bacon up charge.  The manager (Ramon Salazar) did not articulate well, and kept saying ""i offer you free dessert"", again No THANK you.  Learn how to treat customers, learn how to speak on a professional level, learn how to implement quality control prior to sending raw food out to customers, DISGUSTING all the way around.  The manager refused to credit me the charge for the bacon, and welcomed the call to corporate.  I guess that's what I get for going to a low budget chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park

Potato Skins appetizer was not very good.

Roslyn J.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Last night around 11:30 my husband and I entered the restaurant no one was at the front to greet us we waited a few minutes still no one greeted us so we saw 3 people sitting at the bar so we decided to sit at a table in the bar area. The bartender comes over 10 minutes later greeting us with menus I told her we knew what we wanted and I also explained we were reward point members and wanted to use our rewards for the meal she stated she would ""look at that in the end"". So we placed our order along with drinks a few moments later she returned with our drinks I asked her of she could add an additional shot to my glass because she filled the glass FULL of ice and hardly any  Bailey's (I ordered Bailey's on the rocks) I stated if I had to pay extra I would she stated she couldn't add more because she could lose her job that she gave me 2 oz. Well I looked across the bar I saw a gentlemen with the SAME glass I had with a shaker by his glass. So that made me a little uneasy. a few minutes later our chips come out then the manager I assumed he was the manager he never stated his name when he greeted us I walks by and says how are you folks doing I said I'm not happy he stated ""why because I wouldn't allow her to give YOU more than 2 oz?""  (what was the supposed to mean) I stated I would be happy to pay for the additional shot.  I showed him the glass was FULL of ICE he ignored that he stated he couldn't give me more than 2 oz. My husband said this is a bar why are you limiting Bailey's to ONLY 20z when your Long Island has more alcohol he stated the long island was comprised of more than 1 ingredient. Well at this point he's insulting our intelligence!!!! My husband stated to him we eat at Fridays and have ordered and additional shot before with NO PROBLEM. My husband also asked him if this policy was written anywhere he stated OH IT HAS TO BE!!!!! well you're in management and you DON""T know what's company policy???????????????   In the meantime our food arrives I stated I didn't want the food that we would pay for our drinks and leave. NOT ONCE did he say look we don't want to lose you as a customer let me get you another drink or take off the bill or in fact give a professional explanation.

Coming in on a Tuesday it was Jack night. We started off with an order of Jacks strips which were on special for $3. These are some of my favorite, the sauce has a nice sweetness to it and plenty come in one order for sharing. Next we ordered a 2 for $10. For the appetizer we ordered the mozz sticks. Let's get something straight, I don't really mozz sticks all that much and I had a bad experience as a child (undercooked and I didn't chew, I saw the light). Anyhow, these were awesome. They had a garlic taste and I just couldn't stop eating them. The marinara was ehh, whatevs. For the entree, we got the chicken bruschetta pasta. That was pretty good, garlicky. But I consider that a good thing. The total bill was $14, not shabs for two full stomachs. Plus when you are a stripes member, you get free chips and salsa.

Honestly, as much as I try to seek out local places, there is something comforting about chains. And Friday's is, in my humble opinion, one of the better ones. I'm a sucker for some Food Network and enjoy seeing the Ultimate Recipe Showdown stuff on the menu. I had a Thai peanut chicken wrap. I think the concepts of wraps (at least with tortillas) might be a little foreign to Thai folk, but what do I know? I do know that it was pretty tasty, the fries were nicely seasoned, but the whole thing fell apart halfway through and I had to shovel  it in my mouth with a fork. The husband's burger looked pretty tasty  (I think he got the Jack bacon barbecue something...) and the 4 1/2 year old with us gave a ringing endorsement by gobbling up all of his mac & cheese before we could blink. Service was good, too; I think the servers are trained pretty well.  You know, it is what it is, but sometimes, you want something consistent and familiar.

tina l.,"Midlothian, IL",15,12,,1.0,9/10/2013,We go to this TGIF's all the time. We went Sunday during a Bear's game. They had one guy serving the entire bar and all the tables in the room. We waited 15 minutes and left because we didn't even get water. 4 tables around us didn't get served either. The guy that was there waited on us before. He really isn't qualified for the job. We will avoid this place on Sunday. There were only 2 people at the bar during a Bears game!!!!!!! We should have known better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park?start=40
Elizabeth B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,22,3,4.0,4/7/2008,"Yes, this is a chain, but I think it is pretty good!  The employees work hard here, the food is good and now that smoking is not allowed-the bar area is even more popular.  It is very packed and the wait is long on weekends, but I am recommending it.   TGIFRIDAYS offers smaller portion menus and an under $10.00 specials.  My favorite is the tower of Jack Daniel's shrimp, chicken and ribs which is a good deal for under $15.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park?start=40
Jef B.,"Sacramento, CA",147,422,42,3.0,9/26/2007,"OK it's just a TGI Friday's. But the service here has always been good, when we can get seated in a reasonable time. Orland is still a pretty over-shopped, congested shopping area. There's nothing special about TGI Friday's, but if you go there on a Friday or Saturday night there is a good chance they will put you on a half-hour or longer wait for a table. WTF? Wait 40 minutes for a meal at TGI Friday's? Gimme a f--in break.  We won't do any wait for dinner longer  than 20 minutes in the suburbs. There is hardly anyplace worth waiting that long for a meal. I could drive into Chicago in the amount of time we have waited for a table at a quotidian suburban restaurant. With that being said, TGI Friday's is a nice place to eat so long as the ignorant hoi polloi haven't descended on it like a plague of locusts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park?start=40
Don M.,"Mokena, IL",382,460,23,2.0,11/19/2008,The service is good. They keep checking back to see of you need anything else. I usually go for a salad and tried the chicken caesar and it was ok nothing to brag about. We also had the potato skins I am not a big fan of tots but these were good. Other comments were pulled pork was just ok. Drinks were good they make a pretty good jack sour. The place can get crowded and the wait can get long. The parking is a little jacked up to it is right in the entrance to the mall you need to pay attention or get squished. Ok place but better options all around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park?start=40
Steven M.,"Mokena, IL",1162,1210,14,2.0,7/17/2008,"This is a nice place, but there is a lot of competition in the area. The server was spot on. We started with the loaded skins. They were very good. Needed more sour cream though. I had the Jack Daniels pulled pork sandwich. It had onion rings on it that were really not worth the trouble. The fries were just as soggy. The sandwich was pretty disappointing. They put the rings on top so you wouldn't notice they forgot the meat. What was there, had way to much sauce on it. And then they give you another cup of JD's sauce? Overload. My friend had the chicken caesar. Again, nothing to write home about. He said Chilli's was way better. The drinks were pretty good though. I had the Bacardi and lemonade. A little consistency would be nice. I had 3 and they all tasted different? I'm not sure that I would come back here. To many great choices to hook-up with another dud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orland-park?start=40
