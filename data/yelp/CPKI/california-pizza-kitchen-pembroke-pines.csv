Christopher J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",120,26,56,4.0,1/14/2018,"Now we had just finished a run and were in need of some protein and carbs to replenish what we had just used up. Pizza came into mind because it was a great way of getting our carbs and protein in but the problem is finding a healthy pizza. That's when my friend decided on California Pizza Kitchen. I was skeptic at first but quickly my mind was changed after we had our meal.  For the pizza we had gone with wild mushroom with the truffle oil of course because truffle. We had shared it and it was more than enough for a light meal. The truffle oil with the mushroom combination definitely made this one a go to choice for me.  Then for a salad we went with a half size of Thai crunch and goodness did this pack a punch(call of duty reference). I'm slightly biased when it comes to anything Thai related just because of the peanut dressing and combination of veggies. The half of it was more than enough and we did share it. I couldn't imagine eating the full size but it would seem like a great size if you really want a salad and have more people with you to eat.  We didn't wait at all we were shown to a table very quickly and the service was great, our waiter was kind. We did get our food before the bread, not a big deal but we were kind of hoping to get something before our food to snack on. Overall I will have to come again to try more of the pizzas and other food options they offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines
Ivan B.,"Weston, FL",376,53,72,1.0,9/30/2017,"Went to CPK for a quick dinner last night. It took almost two hours.  We each had soup-- arrived in ten minutes My wife ordered flatbread  I ordered fish tacos  After 40 minutes her flat bread arrived, since it was warm(not hot) I asked her to go ahead and start  As she finished, I asked for the manager who arrived ten minutes later after stopping and sitting with a friend at another table. She finally arrived as my main tacos did. She gave the normal so sorry she offered a free key lime pie which took another ten minutes  I wanted out before I started to scream at the server. As the pie arrive I asked for the check and that took another ten minutes as did waiting to sign the check   Never again.  This experience re-enforcers my dislike for chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines
Dorothea P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",269,104,331,4.0,8/22/2017,"If you are at the mall and you don't want to eat at the food court this is a perfect alternative. Even though I come here all the time without even entering the mall. This specific location is actually attached to the mall so it might be confusing to someone that doesn't know the area.  Anyways I really like the pizza from here I usually get the margarita or the mushroom with truffle oil is soooo good! They bring the truffle oil out in a little container so you can add it yourself as you please. (Perfect for parents who have picky eaters as kids). But what I really love about this place is the Thai crunch salad! It's my absolute favorite salad ever!!!! I love how it has peanuts and they put two different types of dressing that's fresh but tangy at the same time. They also have two sizes which is perfect because you can either get a portion for yourself or a portion for the whole table. And I recommend that if you order the Thai crunch add the avocado,(Thank me later).The hummus is great as well they bring it out with warm pita perfect to share right before the salad.  I haven't actually gotten any of the desserts because I'm usually stuffed after all the hummus and salad and pizza but hopefully one day soon I'll try it.  Inside tip: it's really cold inside, they have a balcony outside where you can usually get a table but the waiters sometimes forget about you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines
Gary F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",64,247,1546,3.0,3/12/2017,"Average service and average food.  We started out with the bread, its wss sour doue with olive oil and herbs. Good combined together.  My daughter had a kids pizza with cheese and mushrooms, she seemed to like it. My wife had pizza too, it had broccoli, mushrooms, Eggplant and roasted corn with no cheese.  My said it was very good except it wasn't very hot. I had  the jumbleia  with fettuccine, except it had linguini. I guess the kitchen doesn't know the difference. It was good. It had a nice amount of shrimp and chicken and a good amount of spice.   We did have one small problem, its not worth saying what it was, but I will say the manager was quick to handle it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines
My-Oanh N.,"Davie, FL",363,156,772,3.0,11/22/2016,"This california pizza kitchen is located within the Pembroke Lakes mall. Its a great spot for a girls day out lunch (just like my last visit) but I would say its a little pricey for a pit stop lunch on a shopping mall kind of day.  The service was quick and friendly on the afternoon that I came and the server was also very attentive and patient. The atmosphere is nice yet casual. I order the chicken piccata, which was nothing out of this world, however it did hit the spot. The portion is enough for lunch and even to have some leftovers later as a snack. My friend ordered the brussel sprout and bacon flatbread to share. Beware, this is not healthy! It is yummy and salty, but definitely not for the health conscious.  I dont not have anything bad to say about this restaurant but because of the price, this would not be my go to lunch spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines
Steve W.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",76,63,33,2.0,4/29/2017,"Been coming to CPK since they opened here and generally solid food and service. Had a nice seasonal martini to start and then it was downhill from there. My wife orders salmon, they bring halibut and claim it's a white salmon...uhh no, I know what salmon is, also  my flatbread was cold too. Usually you have a manager come out, this time the chef from the kitchen who explained some salmon from the atlantic is white! Only thing  that's white is maybe salmon trout but this was halibut ...but we waited around for the remake,  they did and of course it was pink... but overcooked. You'd think they'd admit mistake or comp error but nope. Sticking w pizzas and basic fare here.

Elizabeth B.,"Gainesville, FL",177,83,185,5.0,7/30/2017,"This is a great restaurant for fast, casual dine-in! I've been coming here since with friends and family for about 7 years now and I've never had a bad experience. Never bothered to review it until today, but decided to because of our extremely nice server, Lily. It's been a while since I've been impressed by the service in a restaurant, but Lily was so nice and attentive with everything. Upon ordering, I was about to go with my usual, which is the half Chinese chicken salad, but she convinced me to try something new and go with the Thai crunch. It's actually become my new favorite and I'll definitely go again to try it. I know CPK is a pizza place, but I really like their salads there. Not sure how healthy they are, but I justify it with all the veggies that are in it, ha! Over the years, the menu has generally stayed the same but my favorites are still there, and some new yummy food items as well! My dad got the banh mi bowl, and I was pretty impressed by how colorful and yummy looking it was. It's definitely on my list of things to try. My mom wasn't that hungry and ordered a bianco flatbread, which was alright. Overall a great experience, especially for lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines

Our meals came out in great time and were delicious!

Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1609,477,1695,4.0,9/9/2016,"This is a 4 star for my husband's lunch. He really liked his turkey, Brie, and shaved pear sandwich which he ordered with a Mediterranean salad. My small pizza was quite good although I didn't expect the sausage to be as spicy (it had big red pepper flakes in the chunks) and came with my ordered Caesar salad. I didn't eat the salad -- not a fan of wilted dark greens. The way to go for lunch is this mix and match of soups, salads plus pizza and sandwiches. Think next time I'll go with one of the soups and the pizza without the sausage or a different salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines

Michelle F.,"Hialeah, FL",229,39,94,3.0,3/7/2016,"I'll start off by saying, this place got lucky with the three stars. I'll warrant them considering the dishes I picked on my last visit were really great. I've been here a handful of times, each time very spaced out from the last time, but Yelp suggested I write this review and be more involved in the community so here I am... Typing away..... Anyways, service really blows here. Any location I've been too, one thing remains, the FOH hiring manager sucks. My waitress was within arms distance of me and I spent most of my meal waiving her down. My boyf nearly finished his beer before she returned to the table to take our order. We ordered a small plate, the white corn guacamole, cause uh duh camole' and it was really good. Alittle bland in flavor, but nothing like and salt couldn't fix. We decided to split the Harvest Kale salad and a chipotle chicken pizza. We obviously went with the veg option and swapped the chicken out for avocado. Dude, first off the full order of the salad is ridic. Order a half unless you're hungry enough to eat a horse. My man and I couldn't even take it down, but que clasé ensalada meng. Baby kale, toasted farro, heirloom carrots, napa cabbage, red grapes, marinated cranberries, sliced pear , almonds and goat cheese tossed in a house made citrus vinaigrette. This salad has a little bit of a kick to it but it is really good. Like really, really, good. The pizza was great too, three cheese mix, avocados, topped off with a spicy chipotle sauce and a black bean corn salsa. It was toasted to perfection and a lime cream drizzled all over. Uff that shit was delicious. We opted out of dessert considering I would have waited 10 years for my waitress to come back, but whatever. I flagged her down just to get my tab. She then drops off the check and never returned? Like hey, I coulda walked out and you'd never know. Left the cash with the hostess and made my way home.  My suggestion, stop by with some time on your hands, order two drinks ahead and have your order ready to go when your server decides to show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=20

Ended up ordering a ""to go"" order for my husband and it took 40 minutes. Never did I think I would spend 2 hours in a California pizza kitchen.

They are an original pizza company with very unique pizzas.  Some of them are awesome and other not for me.  They are pricey so depending on your budget they are great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=60
Brian C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",23,86,36,4.0,1/21/2010,"Stopped by to have a pizza while walking through the mall at lunch time.  Server was pleasant, and atmosphere wasnt bad.  It does get busy at times during lunch.   Tried the BLT pizza on the wheat dough.  Great combination! The bacon and cheese was baked onto the wheat dough, and then it was topped with lettuce / mayo mixture and sliced tomatoes.  Highly recommend the cheeseburger pizza as well. They dont have lunch specials, so keep that in mind if your looking for a budget $5-$6 /per person lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=60
Eileen J.,"Hollywood, FL",1,35,4,5.0,3/11/2015,Recently celebrated my daughters 9th birthday at California Pizza Kitchen after reading they did parties in a local magazine.  I will say I was very skeptical at first.  When we first called the manager was very nice and accommodating with the info.  He asked what date we wanted to reserve and thats it!  Didn't ask for money or to sign anything.  I kept asking my husband to call and make sure we were all set and we were!  The morning of the party we called the restaurant and asked how much time we had to come in and decorate.  They said come in whenever you want!  The party was perfect.  The chef was extremely patient with all the kids.  Our host and the manager were very accommodating.  We did not feel rushed as the parties are done before the restaurant opens.  We had a whole section to ourselves.  The kids loved making their own pizza.  Easiest and I all say easiest on the pocket party we have ever  had.  I will totally recommend having your next event here.  My daughter and her friends had a wonderful day!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=60
Marnie H.,"Davie, FL",643,109,197,4.0,9/25/2011,CPK has some of the best pizza and salads too!  Another thing I enjoy there is that you can also enjoy a refreshing cocktail!  I don't love the seating.  I feel like I'm in a Denny's but I haven't had anything but a pleasant experience there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=60

Laura Suris G.,"Opa-locka, FL",62,36,26,3.0,1/30/2013,"Ok so this is my first time here. Service was great! Our server would refill our drinks every time we would finish them. We ordered two quesadilla plates from the small plate menu which was pretty tasty. It had 4 slices with a spicy dipping sauce. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and to our surprise when it came out it was soooo small for the both of us. I am a petite girl and I was left hungry. It is 10 inches and as pricey as an extra large pizza from another pizza chain like Papa Johns or Dominoes. It would have been nice to have let us know that it was so small so that we would have ordered more.  The pizza was tasty, but definitely not out of this world. Overall it was a nice experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
Brenda P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",295,677,11574,4.0,10/19/2010,For a chain restaurant in a mall they have a very good selection of dishes with really good quality ingredients and a good starter wine selection which I did not expect. Had their signature BBQ chicken pizza and a salad with gorgonzola and walnuts which was very good. Awesome lemonade and a decent red velvet cake ( not cheesecake factory or grande luxe quality) but still good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
David R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,5.0,2/25/2015,"So, this is a chain restaurant....but, it's a stand out.  The food is terrific, and the prices don't make me feel like I was taken advantage of.  It's consistently good, and they have seasonal options and specials that keep bringing me back.   They are always promoting a local charity, and support tons of fundraisers.   Service, for me, has been off the chart. There's always a manager in sight, and the team seems to be happy.  I'm there with my family twice a month.  Some favorites: Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza, Four Cheese Ravioli, Thai Crunch Salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
Elsa T.,"Hollywood, FL",106,1,,3.0,1/8/2016,"The place looks clean, great music and the service somehow good. However, what turned me off was the very limited small pizzas  and Flatbread options in the menu. It was my first time visiting CPK and I didn't enjoy the fact that I have to almost beg the server in order to get a lunch size Margarita Pizza. I was going to a pizza place and I expected to have a larger variety.  I did get what I wanted after suggesting that I was going to pay for the extra topping on my pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
Marcy D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,23,9,2.0,3/23/2014,"The 2 stars are for the water I finally got.  Twelve waitstaff walking/standing around in an empty restaurant and we were seated next to the staff eating and drinking WATER.  Our waitress was socializing at the bar.  I finally nabbed another waitress and pleaded for a drink 10 minutes in. She also took our order and refreshed my drink.  The waitress at the bar came and introduced herself finally and served the pizza.  I wish I could find the waitress who did most of the work to tip her.  Pizza was good.  Management shouldn't sit patrons next to the staff hanging out and eating.  Profanity, flirting and slapping towels.  Nice kids, but I didn't need to hear it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
Spencer J.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,13,,1.0,11/20/2015,"I decided to order Delivery through the Eat24 app brought to you by Yelp. I thought well because it's yelp, I could possibly trust it. It took over two hours and when my food arrived the driver was rude and the food was stone cold. Also I ordered a smore's dessert and it was like $7, I have a picture because all I got was tiny amount of melted marshmallows? I tried to complain to eat24 and there is no one to get in contact with that can answer any questions or concerns. Also it was a 29.5% mark up for all costs. I spent $59.99- $46.00 food cost and $13 up charge! It's not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40
Sheri Loves A.,"Hollywood, FL",10,95,8,1.0,7/13/2015,"Was here about a year ago and nothing has changed unless you call less customers a change. The food is repulsive and the service is better and more efficient at Mc Donald's. Had a Caesar salad and the lettuce was brown and wilted, being known for their pizza you would think that would at least be good, nope tasted as though it was frozen and reheated from the day before.  Our server looked like she was gang member and was completely unprofessional and walked as though she was at home in her bedroom slippers shuffling into her kitchen for her morning coffee rather then hustling in a restaurant. The manager made his appearance at the end of the meal and looked like he was going to doze off standing by the table, he also looked confused after seeing my uneaten salad and just stood there not knowing what to say to the point I was actually embarrassed for him. Would give it zero stars if I could, praying I don't get sick from what little I ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40

Jessie T.,"Hollywood, FL",51,8,13,2.0,2/10/2013,"This place has changed. It should now be called California Salad Kitchen. While the pizza is still there, they have taken most of them out of the menu. I ordered pepperoni, sausage and mushroom while my wife ordered pepperoni, You know, it just was not that good. What a shame! Cheesecake factory makes a better cheese pizza now. They also took out the hot fudge and caramel sundae out of the menu. The kids sundaes were crap. We looked around and it seemed as if the salads were pretty good. Maybe we'll go back for salads, but I'm not bothering to go there for pizza anymore.

Lee G.,"Hollywood, FL",94,13,5,2.0,5/14/2014,"I came here with a friend to watch the game and get some pizza. It was pretty quiet and peaceful in there. We sat at the bar and there were less than a handful of people total there. The bartender took forever for every single task. I learned this after her bringing us the beer, so at that point I tried to make sure to get everything I would  need from her so I wouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a napkin. Even waiting on the food took a good 45 minutes after the waitress put the order in. The pizza was good and I was hoping it was because it took forever and a day to get.  As further proof that it took forever my beer was straight warm when the pizza arrived. The place has its ups and its downs. The pizza was good , but if you are going there with the intent on leaving quick just DON'T.
