12,Rebecca P.,"Chicago, IL",4,53,25.0,2.0,2012-08-07,"This has been our go-to place when I'm craving ribs, especially with the 2 for $20. Lately, however, the meat has been dry, the portions small, the service barely existent, and now, the drinks are $9?! No wonder the drink prices weren't in the menus. One rocks glass of Margarita is $9. Really? It certainly wasn't that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
11,Scott S.,"West Branch, IA",142,112,196.0,3.0,2013-03-23,"Food is 2-3 stars, and the last time we were there the service was great, 4 star. It's a chain; the menu is too big. The fries are not bad, and their chili is a C+. Would be better if you could get onion with the cheese on top, I'll ask next time. Currently they have decent lunch promotions for $6/7/8 that aren't bad. Better than average kids menu with a lot of options for sides and beverages; unfortunately, my daughter did not care for the cheese pizza, she had better luck with one of the chicken tender variants previously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
13,Jessica A.,"Miami, FL",9,12,,3.0,2013-06-27,"The food is usually good. The silverware always has spots at best and stuck food particles at worst. The service is usually ok. I like the ziosks so that we can just pay and get out, or order dessert if the server hasn't come back.  We like the food so we keep coming back, but I wish they would adjust the cleanliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
14,Mike D.,"North Liberty, IA",79,109,14.0,3.0,2013-12-19,"Just another Chain restaurant...Nothing really special about this one. I thought the food was ok and the service was decent. It just doesn't compare to some of the other chain restaurants in town or any of the local restaurants around. My biggest complaint would be the size of the tables. They are no bigger than a children's table. My family of 4 was very uncomfortable and the waiter couldn't even fit our four dishes and drinks on the table. The one thing that I really did like was the portable pay station at the table. It is an interactive tablet that allows you to play games, look at the menu, check out any specials and the best part you can even swipe your card to pay and it will print you out a receipt right at the table. Very cool technology!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
8,Constance M.,"Iowa City, IA",4,52,82.0,1.0,2014-07-02,wow!  chilis isnt what it use to be. 12.99 for a chicken breast  (not even a whole one) over a few peppers n onions? seriously chilis?  i use to love the fajitas! our bill was $60-- for what? 2 orders of fajitas & chips n guac and some drinks. not worth it! the place was not busy at all--i can see why! i remember it was always hard to get a table--not anymore! quality down & prices up!  no thank-you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
16,Josh S.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",0,13,,3.0,2014-09-04,The food is good for a chain restaurant and throughout numerous visits the quality has been consistent. Located in (or slightly next to) a college town many of the wait staff are college aged. We have had both great service as well as downright terrible service. More good than bad but with the seasonal nature of the staffing change the quality of the service continues to ebb and flow,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
15,Katie O.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,1.0,2014-10-24,"I went here with a group of family members and was appalled at the quality of the food.  The last few times I've gone here the food was ok, not great, but not terrible.  This time it was barely edible.  I ordered a new menu item, the margarita chicken bowl, but subbed shrimp since I don't eat chicken.  The avocado was rotten, the rice was undercooked, but I guess otherwise it was ok.  My mom got an ear of corn with her meal, and while it definitely isn't in season currently, you would think if it's on the menu it would at least be edible.  This thing was so dried out I don't think I would have touched it if I hadn't eaten for a week! I mean seriously, just serve a salad instead or some mashed potatoes.  Don't expect people to pay for something like that.  Not once did the waitress come and ask if our food was ok, probably because she has heard enough times from others that it isn't.  I sure hope my family doesn't chose to go here next time we all get together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
6,Cindy W.,"Dubuque, IA",0,7,,1.0,2015-10-10,Just ate at the Coralville Chilis on An Iowa Hawkeye football game day.  Food was good -service was horrible. We had a nice guy on his second day of serving and he was by himself. He needed more alot more orientation. I chalk this bad experience up to poor leadership. We won't be rushing back there anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
9,Jamison R.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",0,3,,5.0,2015-11-01,Previous meals at this chili's have consistently been pretty good.  However when we ate there this past Friday night we were blown away by almost every aspect of our experience.  Their new fried pickles app was really good with their home style pickles and fried garlic pieces.  Both of or burgers were cooked to perfection just the way we asked for them as well as everything else we ordered.  The food just seemed much better than in the past and fresher.  We were very happy with the experience and will definitely be back soon if they keep it up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
7,Madonna W.,"Iowa City, IA",0,35,16.0,1.0,2016-01-10,"Ugh! Ate there Friday night, it was awful! Husbands ribs were scantly meaty with very little BBQ sauce, fries were oily and cold. I selected 2 beef tacos hard shell, Waitress collected menus and left. Came bs k several minutes later and said ""I'm sorry, we don't have hard shells any more, are soft ok?"" Since I no longer had a menu I said yes. That started me off on the wrong foot! The filling tasted more like BBQ than taco, scraped the two small servings onto my plate and set the soft shells aside. Rice was cold. Just a terrible meal, met friends there, won't go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
4,Inglish T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",142,126,26.0,1.0,2016-06-28,"This place is a joke. Higher prices than most other chilis and the customer service is the worst! No one talks to you or greets you, it took an HOUR to get one app and two drinks while dining in the bar area (mind you there were only three other people there) and when we asked for a water we never ended up getting one. Pretty upset I spent money here. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
5,Danielle P.,"Washington, IA",104,5,8.0,2.0,2016-12-03,"Went with my hubby for lunch, and despite my expectations, I was disappointed.  Service was fine, but my quesadilla was cold and my salad was drenched in dressing. Yuck. Lettuce was limp. Hubby liked his loaded chicken wings, but we probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
0,Bill M.,"Omaha, NE",14,221,501.0,4.0,2017-02-20,"Went here for lunch with the family, as this is where the daughter wanted to go :-). I go the cheese enchiladas, and we shared the fried pickles. The enchiladas were good and so were the pickles, but the pickles were a little too greasy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
2,Chad W.,"North Liberty, IA",0,5,3.0,1.0,2017-03-31,"What a mess! After waiting 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order, we had to go to the host stand where there were 3 people standing staring at they're phones. Finally got drinks and food orders in, had to make the same dish 3 times because they couldn't get it right. (No ranch) A little soap and water would go a long way at this particular store, the booth by the window provided very little chance of seeing out!! 2nd time here, and I'm sure it was the last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
3,Paul S.,"Prior Lake, MN",0,6,,5.0,2017-06-22,Had a great visit to Chili's last night.  We had a group of 6 and we sat in the bar.  Awesome service and great selection of local craft beer.  Hostess was super friendly and made us feel very welcome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
1,Mark O.,"Coralville, IA",74,339,357.0,2.0,2017-11-20,"The server was personable and attended to us regularly.  Most other aspects of the visit were negative.  The menu has items listed that aren't available at certain times, or are completely unavailable.  The Modelo I requested is no longer being served, despite being on the printed menu, and the entree I wanted (bottomless soup, chips, and salad) is not available past 8 PM.  Had I not had company at dinner, I would have paid for my Coors Light and left.   As it was,  I ordered the overpriced chicken tenders with corn-on-the-cob and fries.  The corn was good; the fries were underseasoned.  I'm pretty sure my metal ramekin was not cleaned properly, there was some kind of orange streak in the ranch.  Can't say I'll be entertaining any further request to return to Chili's any time in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-coralville,,,,,
