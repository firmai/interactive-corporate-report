9,Rebecca S.,"Lilly, PA",0,26,,2.0,2013-01-27,The female servers looks like they partied too hard last night and couldn't be bothered fixing their hair.  The hair piled on the top of you head so ok for the gym but you are working.  Take a little pride in your appearance.  None of the servers seemed like they wanted to be there. Sorry I bothered you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
8,Dave S.,"Indiana, PA",0,2,,2.0,2015-03-03,"Only getting two stars because our waitress was about the only thing good at this restaurant.  Place was busy (Saturday), glass on the floor under our table that they didn't clean up, the food was horrible I don't know who cooks, but they need fired!  We love TGIF in Greensburg, but will never go back to this place again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
6,Mary R.,"Altoona, PA",16,31,4.0,4.0,2016-07-19,"Fantastic lunch. Strawberry fields salad with shrimp. Fresh mixed greens, goat cheese, pecans and very delicate scrumptious shrimp. Jack Daniels burger med rare and served with veggies.    Lunch was delightful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
4,Janelle J.,"Altoona, PA",0,10,16.0,4.0,2016-11-05,"The food was really good tonight. I got the jack Daniel sliders for an appetizer and they were tasty and served hot. Our wait time for our entrees turned out to be pretty reasonable considering it was a Saturday night. I had the half rack of BBQ ribs, tomato mozzarella salad, and the mashed potatoes. I enjoyed my meal for the most part. And, the waitress was fine, She got the job done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
2,Tobin K.,"Hagerstown, MD",1,7,4.0,1.0,2017-03-12,"Well, it was a Saturday night, I guess. My girlfriend and I went with her parents. Unfortunately, that's probably the best part of the story. After we sat down, we noticed that the table was unbelievably sticky. For a few seconds, my inner comic book nerd freaked out, replaying that movie scene where Tobey Maguire, as Peter Parker, first realizes that he can walk up walls, but then I realized that it was actually just the remains from the last persons Jack Daniels burger, so that was a bit disappointing. For starters, no pun intended, it was a difficult task to explain to the waitress that we wanted TWO of the endless appetizers for $20, and we weren't trying to rip them off by asking for two and only paying $10. I can only assume that nobody ever orders more than one at a time, even though there were four of us at the table? Anyway, we eventually got through to her, and ordered our food, including the two ""endless"" appetizers. Apparently, the word endless means two, because after that, they don't really check back up on you. Our food took about a half hour to come out, which was fine, but after that, we never saw our waitress again. Unbeknownst to us (I think?), our section must have shut down, because it was full of empty tables, and only two other people by the time we got our food, despite being full when we arrived. I guess when that happens, you don't really matter anymore. We did get another waitress to check on us periodically, but by the time we were finished eating, we were basically playing Jenga with our plates, trying to drop a hint that we wanted the check. I was winning, by the way. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I think what tipped them off, was that I was able to get into their cupboard (not so covert ops style) and get a to-go container for my girlfriend; you know, because nobody else was going to do it. To sum it all up, our time waiting was way more endless than their appetizers ever could be. If time were an appetizer, we were well past full. I also find it hilarious, that the company has taken over the pictures, posting professional menu pictures, instead of letting people post their own. I think I saw one. Like, come on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
5,Kara L.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,,1.0,2017-04-02,"Ok. Let's be real.  We were there on a Sunday night with not even half of the tables full.  I ordered a slushee that had big ice chunks in it, so much that it would not go up my straw.  The food took forever to get there.  Like I'm talking an hour to get to us. Then when it arrived the bourbon barrel chicken was overlooked and dry also it smelled horrible.  The chicken sandwich bread was stale and didn't fit the ingredients. And our guest ( who was 9 months pregnant) thought the salad was the best part of her meal. The cheese sauce on he burger was separated and she was unable to taste the BBQ sauce.  Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
3,tami s.,"Johnstown, PA",2,11,,1.0,2017-04-21,"Waited too long for hostess to greet us, then were told there were no tables available, we could only sit in bar area.  Just want to rest have have a light meal, but appearantly not at TGIF. We left and went somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
1,Rick B.,"Altoona, PA",0,28,1.0,1.0,2017-12-04,I've never seen a higher turnover for managers and worse.service in my life. This place always disappoints. I keep going back because the food is sometimes good. And when it's good it's amazing and when it's bad it's terrible. My son got chemical burn when they left sanitizer in the baby chair. Whoops they said. I once asked the manager of he could jump in and help with drinks a lot of people are waiting he said nope not his job they had call offs sorry. By nature it will be a high volume profit maker and never really be top notch without proper leadership.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
0,Alex R.,"New Hartford, NY",57,3,,4.0,2018-01-06,"I always thought TGI Friday's was just a place where you go to rip some mozz sticks and throwback some Bud Heavy's with the Bros...boy was I wrong!! If your looking to impress that special lady on an elegant date night then look no further than TGI's. I've been crushing on this sweet thang for months now (Tracy from HR ;) ) and I finally got the guts to ask her on a nice, cozy dinner to our local TGI's. We were greeted by a lovely server named Esteban who was an absolute treat...he even complemented me on my new Wrangler Overalls!! The overall ambiance of the restaurant was exuberant with a smoky aroma that enchanted the whole dining area. My beautiful muse ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta and MAMA MIA! CHI BELLA! What a dish! She let me try a taste and it felt like I transported to a Tuscany villa. I figured that in order to impress Tracy I needed to be bold...a man of mystery..so I had to pull the trigger..I went for the ribs. The ribs were mouth watering to say the least...completely to die for! Everything was going phenomenal until I spilled BBQ sauce all over my new overalls! I was so embarrassed but luckily my lovely Tracy thought it was cute (score!). Tracy is the most angelic, pure and divine being on this planet and I will never forget the night we fell in love as we dined at TGI's. But sadly there were no toothpicks at the desk as we left..4 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-4,,,,,
