1,Danyella P.,"Maynila, Philippines",69,190,230,3.0,2015-04-25,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) is a spacious pizzeria located in Greenbelt 5 that serves tasty pizza with a creative combination of ingredients. When I visited it (a sunday night), I saw many groups, so I suppose it's a nice place for a family dine out after shopping. The ambience is casual and the open kitchen is a highlight. The menu is quite complete. You can find soups, salads, pasta and, of course, pizza. CPK offers two kinds of pizza: the Original Hand-Tossed one and the Crispy Thin Crust. I've had the second one, half Pepperoni Supremo and half California Veggie. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. One of the ingredients - the goat cheese - wasn't available, so he promptly suggested another nice cheese to replace it. Well, what I would say is that the pizza was very tasty but not outstanding. If you are looking for a true pizza-lover experience, I suggest going to Motorino, in Greenbelt 3, just a few minutes walking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-makati-5,,,,,

All in all a good experience. I gave it four stars only because they don't have bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-makati-5,,,,,
