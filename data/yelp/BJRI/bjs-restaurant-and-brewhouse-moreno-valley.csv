Angela P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,165,117,4.0,6/30/2016,"My first visit for lunch; the place was not crowded at all. The ""lunch menu"" was great & a value.  My friend had a coupon because she is a reward member. BOGO is always a beautiful thing! So between 3 kids and 2 adults it was under 45. Our server was very attentive, kept drinks coming & paid close attention to our ""picky"" requests... The only negative was the time it took for our food to be prepared. It was quite a while even with good company. Since our food tasted hot& great I'm not totally upset.  I'd come here again for lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60
Annie J.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/22/2017,"Came here with a girlfriend for lunch and had a pleasant experience. Our waitress, Debbie, kept our water full and checked on us often. The manager came by a couple times too. I could see that they care about the customer here at this restaurant. It was my first time to BJ's. I see these restaurants at other locations but haven't tried them before now. If this is how good they treat me, I'll try others too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60
Phil Z.,"Winchester, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/11/2017,"If I could not give stars, I would.  This was one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a restaurant.  Let me preface this with the fact that I am normally very patient and understanding because my husband and I previously owned a restaurant.  We understand that things happen. First, we tried to make a reservation, but were told only groups of 35+ could have reservations.  Second, we tried to ""check in"" with the app.  The app would not let us do so.  We went to the restaurant hoping that it would not be that long of a wait.  I was told that we would have to wait 1 hour.  I explained that I tried to ""check in"" with the app, but the app was not working.  I was told that did not matter.  After I walked away, my husband overheard the hostess manager tell her that was the wrong reaction.  We only waited about 10 minutes.  This was about the only positive part of our night. I ordered the Berry Burst Cider.  A few minutes later the waitress returned to inform me that they were out.  I could order Angry Orchard.  I reviewed the menu and decided on a Strong Bow.  She said they were out of everything but Angry Orchard and Fromboise.  Neither of these appealed to me so I stuck with water. Our appetizer came timely.  But, our meal did not arrive for another 30ish minutes.  Also, it came in spurts.  First, my daughter received her mac and cheese.  It was only warm.  A few minutes later, I received my ""margherita pizza"".  It was only warm.  It was not hot.  I could touch the pan!  After a few more minutes, my mother in law received her parmesean crusted chicken after it was shoved in the armpit of the server.  At this point, everyone but my other daughter had received their meal.  They were all luke warm.  We flagged someone down to get the spaghetti.  It finally arrived.  IT WAS COLD.  Ridiculous!  My mother in law's broccoli was ice cold. My pizza was not a ""Chicago"" style pizza.  I know what ""Chicago"" style is.  My family is from Chicago, and the restaurant that we owned served ""Chicago"" style pizza.  The edge of the pizza that would be against the wall of the pan was non-existant.  It did not have a crust basically.  The middle part of the pizza was limp when help up.  It should have some crustiness to it and be able to stand so to speak.  When I heated up my leftover pizza a few days later, the crust in the middle was just right.  This means that the pizza was not cooked correctly.  Either it was not cooked long enough or the pizza oven is not hot enough.  Everyone else did not have an issue until the pizookie nightmare....... My husband and father in law had birthdays.  We got them the birthday pizookie.  They arrived at the table about 20 min after which is what I expect from my prior experience.  At that time, we ordered both daughters their own child pizookie.  After 30-45 minutes of nothing arriving to the table, we flagged someone down.  It was being worked on or so we were told.  Another 10 min go by, repeat flag down it's being worked on.... Complain to Mark the manager.  He will see what is going on.  Another 10-15 min later NOTHING.  Then, the kitchen manager gets pointed to us by Mark after Mark ran away from my father in law trying to flag him down a second time.  He apologizes.  We complain about everything especially the fact that the 5 and 10 year olds are waiting MOST PATIENTLY for their pizookie.  One arrives while we are talking to him.  The ice cream is MELTED.  So how long did it have to sit for someone to bring it to us for it to be MELTED?!?!?!?!?!?!!?  He says he will comp our meal.  We ask for the other pizookie (for the 5 year old).  It arrives.  NO ICE CREAM!!  Uh, it has no ice cream... Kitchen manager, ""I didn't know if you wanted the ice cream.""  Yes, it is for a child.  At that point, he discloses that they ran out of the flavor that she wanted., and he had to give her one size up.  WHY ON EARTH HAS NO ONE TALKED TO US ABOUT ANY OF THIS?!?!?!?!?!??!?!  So the 5 year old now has her pizookie that is HOT.  It was the only part of our dinner that was hot. So we get the bill....... the drink that I never got which was sold out was on the bill.  The meal was not comp'ed.  My mother in law complained to Mark again about how bad this whole thing was.  She had to demand that he do something about it and suggested gift certificates for us to return.  We got the gift certificates, but we are still not sure about returning.  Mark talked to us and apologized and told us he wanted to make it right.  He is not the right person for that position.  You need a strong leader.  You need someone who will take charge.  You need someone who will TRAIN your people.  Also, the front of the house should be taking responsibility for the mistakes and making them right.  He should not be hiding and sending the kitchen manager to talk to the customers. I left off the part about how the waiters and waitresses kept walking behind our chairs and running into us to get to the table behind us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60
Chef E.,"Salem, OR",0,8,,1.0,5/18/2017,"I love pizza and beer! I also like being acknowledged as a guest/customer/person when seated (at the bar) by the bartender or staff. I also like my pizza cooked. ****This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse doesn't like what I like.***** My reasoning is based on actual experience on a Sunday night after 10pm.  I sat at the end of the bar near the kitchen, where the employees congregate and talk shit about other employees and customers. I overheard conversations. Meanwhile I sat waiting for service for a good 10 minutes or more. I gave it a few more moments before I walk out. Soon someone is behind the bar. A couple minutes later she arrives at this end of the bar and greets me, hands me a menu, and then was about to walk away. ""I'm ready to order"" I speak up before she can. ""Small pizza and an IPA, please."" A few minutes later my beer is served and eighteen minutes later my pizza is served.  Hum? I'll give them the benefit of doubt and I take a bite from a slice. Doughy. The cheese isn't fully melted. Pizza isn't hot. When the bartender came back around I asked if possible to have a cooked pizza with all the cheese melted? She took the pizza and handed it to someone else while repeating my exact words for them to tell the kitchen. Ten minutes later the same pizza is returned with the cheese barely all melted but more than before. My first thought was this sucks. I equated the taste and texture to be as close as possible to eating a used soggy dish sponge topped with canned tomato sauce and pre-shredded mozzarella cheese then microwaved for 18 seconds, then plated and served with a beer. I ate it. Paid the bill with 20% tip. Then left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60

Lisa A.,"Perris, CA",2,54,31,2.0,10/25/2016,"Came to this location 10/20/2016 around 3pm for lunch. The place was pretty empty and we got seated right away. We were very hungry and eager to eat.  The waitress took over 15 to order our drinks, 5 min more to take our appetizer order, she left and came back 10 min later to get our food order. She took forever!   When our appetizer arrived she left it on the table and left. She left us no plates! We had to stop her and ask for them. We sat there with our wings for a few minutes before we got our plates.  Then there is a shift change and we get a waiter. Later, there when our food comes he leaves us our food but no condiments. We wanted cheese and chilli flakes for our food. We found him at the bar so I had to get out of my seat and walk over to him to ask for some. Look the whole point to my rant is that I am angry at this place because of the terrible customer service.

Chris R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,33,,1.0,7/2/2017,"I've been coming here since grand opening. The food is alright, and the service is okay. But that's not what I'm going to be talking about. Instead, id like to bring up one event in particular.  I wanted to rent a keg for a party. I called the restaurant and ordered it. They told me I could pick it up the day before my party.  I go to pick it up and they tell me that there's a small problem. They have the keg, but they don't have a tap for it. The manager tells me that they can hold it there for me while I go rent a tap from a liquor store. I thought this was a good idea, so I went out and did that.  I showed up the next day (day of my party) to pick up the keg. Larger problem. The manager brings out the keg and it is not what I thought. The attachment for the tap needs something called a bass tap. I had never heard of this before, apparently it is kind of rare to find kegs with this. The manager offered no solution other than to go out and rent the proper tap. If I couldn't find it, I would be refunded. It might just be me, but I would expect a company that owns and rents out these kegs to have the proper equipment to use them.  I caved and went out in search of this tap. It wasn't easy, but I found one and rented it. Even the people renting it to me (a specialty beer shop) were so shocked that they called BJ's and asked why they would even rent something this rare.  We finally got the keg to the party (late). And all was well. That is until the next day when I tried to return it. I brought it in, collected my deposit and started walking out. Another manager yelled at me saying that she cannot accept a ""full"" keg. The keg was at a party. It was less than halfway full. It's usually pretty common to return one that's not empty. This wasn't my problem with what she said, my problem was with the fact that they offered absolutely no way to even use this thing and then expected it to be completely empty. And on top of all that, they took back my $100 deposit.  Long story short, don't rent a keg from here. The managers are completely inexperienced when it comes to this sort of thing and will offer no solution when a problem comes up. If this is the kind of attitude management has for small things like this, then it's no wonder why they received a B from the health department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=60

He lost 5 lbs in one day :( My younger brother had the brisket burger and had a stomach ache for 2 days.

Zanae Z.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Its so much that happened I do not know where to begin. First I scheduled a party for my two girls by going in and meeting with one of the managers Mark. We discussed having guest up to 25-30 people and I was interested in the buffet pizza & two types of pastas with meat. I was quoted $14.95 per person. Myself, my husband, and our girls sat down with Mark and discussed the menu and also the pazookies  as a desert for our guest. We were happy when we left Mark stated he would email us the contract. Needless to say I never got the contact so I call and got another Manager which was a female she ended up sending asking for my email address to send the contract so that we can finalize are agreement. I checked a couple of days later no contract I called back spoke with Mark he said he would email it over again. l checked and received the email; however, the contract was not correct. I then went back into the venue the next day and spoke with Camrielle and we went over all the details in person and finalized the contract.  The night of the venue was on 12/9/17 the manager on duty was the female manager I spoke with to finalize the contract. Once the pastas came out I noticed that neither had meat. I brought that to the managers attention & her reply was well that will be an extra $2 per person. I informed her that I was never advised of that and I do not feel I should be charged for something that I was not aware. Again I came down twice and responded through email to make sure everything was correct. She replied ok i'll take care of it. The manager came out with chicken and meatballs on a plate and put them inside of the warmers with the pastas ""NOT OK!"" Shortly after one of my guest was eating the pasta and found a long curly blonde piece of hair. She went to the manager asking if she could replace the pasta because there was a piece of hair inside & the manager reply was that she do not have employees with blonde hair ""NOT OK!!"" After my guest informed her it dose not matter we do not want pasta with hair in it. After this issue I asked about the individual dessert and she stated that they do no offer the singles anymore and that I would have to get one big platter for my guest to share which was not a part of the contract again ""NOT OK!!!"" The overall service was not professional and the service this night was terrible from this manager  my server did his best to accommodate my large party he did have assistance, but when we ordered adult beverages it took 20 mins at a time and when my guest went over to the bar to order they were told by the manager that they could not take their drinks from the bar. This took too much time away from my children party & I am very upset to say the least, but I did not say anything then because I did not want to ruin my girls party!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=20

Devin R.,"Manchester, NH",14,98,37,3.0,2/13/2016,"Hit up the lounge area with some co-workers this week. Shortly after sitting down, we were greeted promptly and offered some beverage suggestions. Given that BJ's brews their own stuff, we asked about IPA options and were advised that they had a seasonal brew on tap - the Committed IPA. After waffling about, the waitress offered to bring over a sample for the 4 of us. Great sample sizes, let me tell you! After giving this a taste, we were subsequently talked into trying the beer sampler option. A little tough to choose only 4 given the variety of beers here, but I made do with a Lager, the Pale Ale, the aforementioned Committed and a Stout. After giving them all a whirl, the Committed was probably the best of the bunch. Their lighter brews all kind of taste alike.  Dinner was a bit of a mess. It started ok with the Tomato/Mozz salad - good portion for a side and tasted excellent. Unfortunately, the main course - the Sirloin - was horrendous. I ordered it medium and it came out pretty rare, and the cut was awful - very sinewy. She took it back to give it some more heat, but we all know how that turns out. The hockey puck that returned was inedible. Without asking, the waitress kindly knocked it off the bill, but the damage was done. With one of these places that has a Cheesecake Factory-esque menu in which they try to provide something for every taste under the sun, it's impossible for the food to be great. So, if you go in with low expectations, you'll probably be ok here at BJs. Unfortunately, not a lot of other options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=80

Christopher R.,"Corona, CA",295,26,5,2.0,5/29/2016,"Out of all the times I've been to this location tonight has to be the most disappointing. The wait time was less than 5 minutes but unfortunately for my friend and I that was the shortest wait time for us the entire night.  It took our waiter over 10 minutes to finally come to our table to ask us for drinks and also appetizers. My friend and I already knew what we wanted to get so we ordered our food the first time she came to our table. Our food was pretty decent at best, with a clam chowder that was basically just a chowder and a lukewarm Parmesan crusted chicken although the salad we had was the most redeeming thing we ordered. After we ate our meal we waited about 20 minutes before our waitress came to ask if we needed the check or if we wanted desserts. We ordered 1 pizookie and that took 30 minutes to come out. A pizookie is good but it's not worth that long of a wait.  I understand the wait times on busy nights but tonight was an extremely slow night with many empty tables within the restaurant. I don't really understand how I've had better service that is expected of BJs at this location on extremely busy nights and even nights when I'm with bigger parties for birthdays. I used to enjoy this location when I was in college so hopefully something gets fixed or I will not be returning when I'm in the Riverside area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=80

We ordered a wedge and caesar salad and when the salads came out, the food runner brought out 2 wedge salads and plastic wear because ""no one was wrapping silverware in the back.""  As we were eating our wedge salad, the salad bowl had tomato sauce crusted inside the bowl. Nasty! It was like eating off someone else's plate. Our pizza came out fast and was fine. Our dessert on the other hand, took 20 mins to come out. If you come to the Moreno Valley BJ's location, don't plan on having good service, clean plates, or regular silverware.

Jordan Z.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,17,5,1.0,1/8/2017,"The food was good, took forever to get my ranch. Huge negative because I was 7 fries in without ranch. I sat at the bar and I must say the bar is so dirty. The bartender has bottles out and paree out and not fridge-rated. It's so dirty and she sat in the corner playing with a straw while my water was empty. She came up to me and asked me if I was doing okay and my water was clearly empty. The bartender sat in the corner (LEANING) after filling my water, giving orders to employees. She than told an employee named Jose to clean the 2 tables and he just walked away but she did say it with a huge attitude. Every 5 minutes she will do something than drink her hidden Starbucks in the corner. She leaves fridges open for long period of time as well. For the remainder of my stay she talked to every employee gossiping about each employee. Very unprofessional and when you're trying to have a relaxing dinner, it differ. The only good thing about this stay was the easy to find parking because someone had just pulled out. Hopefully corporate sees this post and talks to her.

The dish I ordered ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"" was TOO sour. I do not know what, but I think they put a little too much lemon sauce in it.

Once they dropped all my food after I had been there for like an hour, so I had to wait another 45 min for them to make it again... Didn't bother me that the food was dropped, it happens, what bothered me is that they didn't try to make my visit better. Waitress just said I'm sorry someone else dropped your food it wasn't me tho, and then later she said her manager was going to come talk to me... But they never did. So I stopped eating here and tried picking up pizookies to go a few times... and they've always been poorly made, extremely burnt.

Both hostesses were less than welcoming and our waiter hardly made rounds so we were almost done with our meals by the time we finally got everything and I never got a water refill.  It took more than 30 minutes just for appetizers and even longer after that for meals.  They spilled tea on my mom.  Also knats were everywhere!

Trying to pay through their mobile site was difficult and as she tried to help she was getting very upset. My sister is part of the points program and when she didn't get them she wanted to tell our server but by this time we were afraid of her reaction since she was already about to flip out!

I've never really had a problem or been annoyed other than the times they take forever to get your order ( which I dismiss when the restaurant is at its full capacity). I  walked in today at about 2pm. The restaurant was close to empty. I saw lots of empty tables and waitresses walking around serving and taking orders. I only went in because I forgot my glasses the night before. I called and a nice lady wrote my name on them and placed them in a secure location for me to pick up.  I waited at the front for what felt like forever. There was no hostess and no one was coming to ask me if I had been helped. I noticed the waitresses glancing over and looking at me but they kept walking away and doing other things or not even acknowledging  me at all. A lady finalllyyyyyy came and asked me if i needed help ( she looked at me as if I was a BUM -__-). I told her about my glasses and she called her manager. He came out and said im sorry they are not here. Then I told him to please look again since I had called and someone had put them away for me. He came back 10 minutes later apologizing and saying he found them.

Heather C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",34,42,5,1.0,5/26/2015,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's, but I must say, this one has the WORST service I've ever encountered.  I frequently travel for business in the area and call in orders for pick up.  Almost every single time, I am put on hold for several minutes before anyone picks up the to-go order phone or I end up hanging up and calling back. My latest call hold time... 9 minutes the first time and 13 minutes the second.  NO ONE EVER ANSWERED!  I finally gave up.    When picking up orders, I'm very rarely ever greeted by the to-go server and then when someone else says ""someone will be right with you"", I end up sitting around for another 10 minutes as I watch all of the servers chatting away amongst one another.  When I recently ordered several items for a large group, my pizza wasn't ready upon arrival and I was told I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  WHY, when I ordered 40 minutes prior and the other five meals were ready??  The server couldn't (or wouldn't) answer me.  When I asked to speak to the manager, I was finally told that my pizza had been dropped and they had to make a new one.  OK, fine, shizz happens, but why not just tell me the truth and offer a drink or something while I'm waiting?  Even that didn't happen when the manager got involved.   So, unfortunately, as much as I really do like the pizza at BJ's, I definitely won't be returning to this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=160

Samantha V.,"Fontana, CA",2,23,60,3.0,1/6/2018,"Long story short:  We paid $60 to wait a long time to eat good food at a claustrophobic table in an establishment with enough drama to be a high school.  All of the food we ordered was really good (which is the only reason I gave 3 stars) The tomato & mozzarella salad was refreshing, the wings were nice and crispy (could've used a bit more sauce), and we both very much enjoyed the dishes we ordered.  Short story long:  My experience here was mediocre at best. The food was really good, but the atmosphere & flow of the restaurant really ruined the experience for me.  We were a party of 2 and seated in a mini booth. Our drink orders were taken promptly, Diet coke & water, and we also ordered the buffalo wings appetizer. Our drinks took quite a while to get to us. Once we got our beverages we asked for more time to look over the large menu. About 10 minutes later we ordered the rest of our food: a stater salad, spaghetti & meatballs & lemon thyme chicken. Our server informed us that the wings app should be right out.... about 15 minutes later A different server brings us the wings & starter salad & literally walking right behind her was another server with our 2 meals. I have no idea where our original waitress was?  So picture this, a couple at a mini/half booth with a drink each, a long rectangular plate with wings, celery & ranch, 2 small plates to eat the app on, a salad plate & our 2 meals! We had to play Tetris to attempt to fit everything on our Table! So my boyfriend decides to try to scarf his salad down to make us some room. We then put the salad plate under the plate of wings so we could have some room. All of a sudden our original waitress comes and goes to grab the stacked plates, which makes sense if the plates were stacked & empty, but we still had 4 wings left and 6 celery sticks. The only reason these plates are stacked is so we don't have to eat our actual meals on our laps! So I tell her ""  We're still working on the wings, we just didn't have room for everything"". So instead of taking the empty plate under it and the small plates with bones of the wings we had eaten, she sets the stack back down and leaves.    So now we're eating our meals & we overhear a different waitress exclaim to a busboy "" I'm going to the back, I don't want to see him!"" And she walks away. Now the busboy is swearing "" F this & F that"" and he's getting all riled up. At this point I ask for some boxes and the check and we leave in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley
Sydney M.,"Riverside, CA",64,3,,1.0,10/26/2017,"Update: I received a message from someone at BJ's Restaurants. She gave me her direct e-mail and phone number. The e-mail bounced back, and the number was constantly busy or just rang. Still not going back to this location.  I went out for dinner with a friend, it was a Saturday night and very busy, so I expected the service was going to be affected. However, after a series of events that could have been avoided, I've decided to never return to this location.  1. Server spilled an entire tray of beer on me (3-4 ice cold bottles of beer). 2. When she realized what she had done, she ran away to go on break and never returned. 3. It took 10 minutes to get the attention of anyone.  4. A bus boy brought over more cloth napkins (that honestly do nothing to soak up any amount of liquid) and literally stood there staring at me, doing nothing until I told him I needed the puddle in my seat mopped up.  5. The manager never told us who he was, he just stood at our table making awkward conversation, reassuring me that the server was going to be okay, it's just embarrassing to spill orders, while I was standing there dripping. 6. It took over an hour to see our waitress again because, ""I saw you talking to my manager and I thought you were upset with the service, so I didn't want to come back to your table.""  All in all, a very poor dining experience. I've eaten at this location before and had some troubles with servers taking a long time to take orders, or basically just dropping orders and then disappearing until its time for the check.

Karl H.,"Wilmington, CA",23,7,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Well. I am not a fan.  Was craving prime rib. Bj's had a prime rib special going. They advertise in the menu a 15oz cut cooked to perfection. This is not true. It was more like a 12 oz cut and it was not seasoned whatsoever. The salad came first and not 2 bites into the salad my prime rib came. I said it was too fast and they offered to take the roast and keep it under the warmer. Which would have cooked it more and dried it out so i said no. The prime rib was cold and was kind of choppy the way it was cut. It was not a desirable cut of meat.   The server was a female. Her name was michelle and she was ok. But was over swamped with a table of 8 and mine and another table of two so i kinda got lost in the shuffle.  I was done eating and got my dessert included in the price, and it was good but too hard to eat.  It was the piezookie cookie, I didn't like the way they served it. Got cold too fast and the cookie stuck to the metal dish and was very hard to eat.  After dessert i waited about 15 minutes before i got my bill and then another 15 to get it back with my credit card.  Overall the meal was not worth the $27.00 they charge for it not to be cooked right and the right weight/size. The turn around time from salad to entree was way too fast and the long wait for the bill and return was kind of upsetting.  I will not come back unless bj's makes an appeal for me to do so.

Sarina L.,"Riverside, CA",468,177,234,3.0,12/12/2016,"This review is for this location specifically. I love BJ's wide menu choice and it usually comes out pretty good. Their service is not too great though. I've been to this location multiple times to dine in and to have take out as well. From my dine in experiences, the waiter/waitresses are usually really nice and happy to help out. They are also really busy helping multiple tables so sometimes it is hard to flag them down. The food always takes forever to come out. I don't mind that too much as my friends and I usually have good conversations while we're waiting and I also know that they're taking their time to make it if it takes that long. In a few instances, we've had mistakes in the orders where they forget to mention to the cook about a change or overall did not enter an order into the system.  In my take out instance, it took a while before someone can help us with our order. When they did, they apologized for the wait time and took our order. The food took even longer to come out. I would say I was there for almost 1.5 hours waiting for my food, to go. I might as well dined in at that point. Though the staff was apologetic of the wait, I think there might need ot be a better system implemented to prevent this long wait time, especially for to-go orders. Food: Their pizzas are always a good thing to order, deep dish or flat bread. I had their avocado eggrolls, perfect if you're an avocado enthusiast like I am. Pizookies are always amazing, if you're feeling full but want to squeeze in a pizookie, you can order a mini (even though that option is not on the menu, just ask!) I'll still be coming in to eat here as I like their huge options and of course the pizookies.

Elias was our server is a tremendous guy very friendly. Went here to celebrate a birthday and it is a very clean place to do so. I can understand why the reviews weren't tremendously great in this place however our experience was decent! We basically just came here for a few drinks dessert and appetizer. I have the snake bite paired with the calamari... The trick is to put a lot of lemon on it that way you don't taste as much as the seafood flavor to the calamari overall it was flavorful,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley

Alizen R.,"Irvine, CA",778,297,942,2.0,12/13/2015,"Though this was not my first time coming to BJ's, it was certainly one of the most disappointing visits I have had in years.  I came to celebrate my roommate's 21st birthday and despite the fact that they could not make reservations for us on the day of the event, we decided to come around 9pm to try our luck with seating. After waiting about half an hour for a party of 8, we were seated in a relatively slow section--which I always take for a good sign since that means faster service! I forget the name of our server but I suppose it doesn't matter. Her lackluster personality and unprofessional behavior made it hard for me to take her seriously. She didn't card half of my party and the other half only got carded because they had their IDs out. I find this very unprofessional and unsafe as underage guests could have just as easily ordered alcoholic beverages without her knowledge. I'd be a little more careful with a liquor license, but since she was complaining about how late she was working I guess she didn't care about getting the company in trouble either.  The food, on the other hand, was quite delicious! I ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup for $5.95 and though I wish it was a little less creamy it sure hit the spot. For my alcohol of choice I started with a Blood Orange Pom Sangria for $8.25 and a Piranha Pale Ale for $5.50 afterwards. The sangria would've tasted much better without the Fireball whiskey in it but regardless it still did the job.  Towards the end of the night I asked our server for the check. She came back about ten minutes later and took a seat next to me, only to start complaining about how tired she was because she went out the night before and was so hungover that working that day was just a regrettable decision. I asked her how long she had been working and she said 4 hours. I couldn't tell what I found more off putting, the fact that she blatantly did not care about how terrible her behavior was or how badly she portrayed the employees of this restaurant. Either way, I was not impressed.  When we finally got our bill, she got one thing correct: my roommate's birthday. Despite the amount of times we asked her for Parmesan cheese and a myriad of other condiments, at least she managed to bring the birthday pizookie out.  Overall, I am very disappointed in this restaurant. I understand that employees are only human, but considering the fact that her section was relatively empty and it wasn't a busy dinner time at all, I would have appreciated better and more professional service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=40

We ordered an Irish Mule and an Alabama Sunset. Both were filled with ice completely with barely any of the actual drinks (which were really good. TOO BAD WE ONLY GOT SIPS OF THEM). I DO NOT eat red meat and ordered salmon pita tacos. The quinoa salad it came with had a long piece of hair in it and my salmon taco had a chunk of bacon in it. REALLY? The chef came out and apologized, and offered me a meal. That was nice but I was already over it and lost my appetite.  Like I said. This place is usually great but tonight was a mess. The manager, who didn't seem to care much at all, said that that's how the drinks are made and apologized for the hair and bacon. All I know is that my dinner was ruined and I'm taking a break from this place. My entree and drink were taken off my tab (not something I ever ask for but tonight was way too much).

When they finally left, I waited about 15 Minutes before I bussed their table myself so my family could finally be all together. My cup sat empty for most of our time there and when they set up the family sized salad and pizza, they shoved a table against the wall and left about 12"" of space to fit in to serve (causing someone's backside to be in the face of two people at the end of our table.

The manager was soooo busy they sat and waited another 45 minutes! The  waiter came and apologized repeatedly for the wait until finally they demanded to speak to the manager. MARK the RUDE manager came over, My husband politely informed him they are visiting military celebrating a bday, can we get our drinks now? Sure he says, gives them IDs back and walks away never apologizing for the wait or even a happy bday, nothing.....15 minutes later the beers finally arrive! I would never treat a guest in my home that way let alone service members. Is this your policy BJs? To add insult to injury the food was cold and no silverware!

Yuan C.,"Chicago, IL",388,344,433,2.0,5/5/2014,"When I was back in high school, BJs was my favorite restaurant! Buuuuut something drastic must have happened within the last several years. Either my taste buds are suuuper different or BJs changed up their flavors. The most recent time I was here, the food was kinda awful :( Here are the items I ordered:  1. Avocado eggrolls- 5/10, not that bad. The sauce was too sweet though, so I ended up  adding some salt and pepper to spice up the sauce lol  2. Buffalo chicken pizza- 1/10. EWWWW. Seriously, BJs, you GOTTA take this item off your menu because it is inedible. The buffalo sauce was so powerful that it STUNG my nose. In the end, I just picked off the bits of chicken and ate that instead.  3. Tuscan chicken limone: 1/10. Another dish we regretted ordering. I was hoping it to be just a hint of lemon, but each bite of the pasta was like eating a single piece of lemon.  4. Pizookie: 10/10! If you're dining at BJs and you don't get this, then you're missing out big time! What is a pizookie, you ask? It's basically a yummy , warm, melty cookie with a scoop of delicious ice cream on top!! BJs has several different flavors to choose from. I ordered their newest one, salted caramel, which was AMAZINGGG.  So I definitely recommend this!

Anyway it takes about 15 minutes just to get a waiter to come take our drink order takes even more time after that and for some reason my brother's margarita was taking awhile anyway he finally comes back with the margarita and we order our appetizers which are gone pretty quick. Then waited even more time to order our actual food by this time I'd emptied my water but I also had a pink lemonade so I waited to say something we ordered our food my usually favorite dish came out with the rice being cold, hard, and dry. My brother's meal was totally forgotten about and by the time he got it everyone else was already done. And at this point 3 of us had finished our drinks and we're still thirsty couldn't track a waiter down for more.

He never came back. 10 mins later we flagged down another waitress and asked to speak to the manager, while she was getting the manager another waitress came to our table and advised us that our waiter went home and she was taking over....  A couple minutes later the manager came out carrying our pizza and apologized for the delay of our pizza.  We ended up taking our pizza home bc after 45 mins waiting we knew our toddler was not going to sit any longer and was going to make a scene soon, which if we all would have eaten together (like you normally do when you eat out) we wouldn't have had to worry about that. Had the manager not been so awesome and  gone above and beyond to recover the mess the waiter had made, this review would have been a 1 star.  We offered to pay for the kids meal, our drinks and soup bc we were able to partake in them, but the manager insisted on taking care of it all and apologized numerous times for the lack of service we received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=200

As for the food, the Mahi Mahi with pineapple fried rice was so oily we sent it back. Oddly the waitress chose to bring a plate of half cooked brown rice in return.  That's what one gets for assuming a new order of rice with pineapple and other veggies would be the replacement.  The new lasagna is a mockery of its namesake; its just cheese ravioli in a pan with no flavor. The menu said it would have sausage.  It had two pieces like you would have on a pizza. The sauce had a canned metallic flavor.  We both left half our food behind.  As for service, besides the rice debacle, the waitress was completely incapable of getting our drinks right.  I ordered diet coke, my friend a regular coke.  They started off reversed and every refill she failed to bring the right version mixing them up over and over.  The other notable issue was after the food was delivered, the obligatory food check was skipped leaving us for about 5-10 minutes while we were not happy making the fried rice debacle more like adding insult to injury.

Guess up until the last time,we were both pleased and never cared much to change our meeting place.  HOWEVER, this last time, we met for breakfast, instead of our normal lunch.   All I have to say is breakfast there was close to awful.  Scrambled eggs were cold... as if they had been made a day ahead and just sat there waiting to hop on someone's plate.  I was starving and after taking 3 bites, decided to send them back.  You know what they say about sending food back, so I hesitated at first, but asked them to just bring me some hot, fresh ones. My friend's order was totally wrong.  She ordered a veggie scramble thing that was on the brunch menu, but instead got normal day old scrambled eggs and bacon.  The waitress seemed quite confused... maybe she was new, so ok, I guess, but this is the very first time I decided to write a review on this BJ's.  Unfortunately, it's not as good as it would have been had I not had breakfast there. We complimented on how good the coffee was though and the waitress said she'd find out the brand, but .. of course, never came back to tell us.  Still good ambiance and we always feel comfortable over-staying our welcome, especially since we drove so far to meet.

Waste of money and very run down in terms of food and utensils. Came in after a swim meet nearby because we were starving and the only place we knew nearby that showed up on our search engine and was open was BJs.  We came in and sit down, just a few people were eating since it was a few hours after noon in the middle of the day. Our server comes over and greets us and we give her our drink orders and since we already knew what we wanted to eat we gave that order to her as well. She doesn't write down any of our order and walks to another table to take their order right away once we were done. Later she comes back to give us our drinks and she forgets my drinks but I let it slide since I am normally fine with water anyway. She asks us this time what our order is again because she forgot on the way because she did not write it down. A little bit unprofessional.  We get our salads and notice that the forks are all beat up and bumpy. I don't complain but my mom tries to get another set since hers are worse than mine and gets another set of beat up utensils but they're better. My salad is alright but it is noticeable the lettuce is going old. My mother complains about her salad while she's eating it that she had some tomatoes that were old. We did not say anything to the server about this because we didn't want to have our food messed up because we got the restaurant angry with us complaining. When our food came out, I was given an extra side I did not ask for. I didn't say anything but in the end I was not charged. My fries were alright but my steak was well done. I know this is not a fancy expensive place to get steaks but the least they could do is not cook our steaks where they were well done and super dry from being so done. They were extra chewy and difficult to eat. I actually had to put ketchup on my steak to get rid of the bad taste it of drowning in seasoning. My mother on the other hand not only has the same issue but her mashed potatoes were extremely dry. She loves mashed potatoes but she couldn't even eat a few bites.

My visits have been okay, nothing extraordinary but I've never complained either.. until last week. Our hostess (a blonde who I believe was named Jessica) was just clueless! I don't know if she was new or just lacked customer service. I asked for a dish that was no longer on the menu and she instantly said ""no we can't make it because it's not on the menu anymore"" , mind you I have ordered this same exact item before AT THIS LOCATION! It was also not on the menu back then! My problem with this was that she didn't even bother to ask the cooks or anyone, it was an immediate no. At this point I was just irritated since this is the only thing I order every time. My boyfriend suggested we leave if I didn't want anything else but I didn't want to because he had already ordered his food. During the few times when she decide to check on us (which took a while after she told me about my item), she would only ask my boyfriend if everything was ok or if we needed anything. I felt uncomfortable and couldn't wait for us to leave. I admit that I was also annoyed and it probably showed but that was because of the customer service that I was receiving.  I have ordered the same exact thing at other locations (in Orange county) and although it's not on the menu anymore they still accommodate my request.

It's not as if BJ's is exactly fine dining, but it is always so ridiculously busy as if it was lol - if it wasn't busy all the time I would probably go more often, but since it is always busy I go every few months or so.  If you're going to BJ's, especially on the weekend or a holiday, plan on waiting at least 20 minutes even if you call ahead.  I made the mistake of going on Valentine's Day because I wanted a drink, they have a bar, and the peach frost I got there last time was delicious - plus we are in love with the ahi poke tuna appetizer, seriously, the best appetizer they have - but even that was not up to par.   Pretty much everything I put in my mouth was bad. We got the ahi poke, it was good, but not as great as usual.  First bad sign.  I ordered a drink and it took 10 minutes and when I got it, it was the ABSOLUTE WORST PINA COLADA EVER MADE.  I've ordered food before, my plate be completely wrong, and not sent it back because I dont like to make a fuss haha, but I just had to send that back.  I got their house favorite drink, the strawberry splash, and they couldnt even make that taste good nor was it fully blended.  Pretty much, they both tasted like vodka blended with some ice.  I didn't ask to send it back but the waitress saw that I wasnt drinking it and insisted so she brought me a strawberry mojito because it is her favorite drink - I didnt like that either, but I drank it so she wouldnt feel bad lol and we tipped her extra for caring so much.  Whoever was the bartender on Valentine's Day night is HORRIBLE.  I also ordered a tomato bisque because their's is my second favorite in the area after Romano's, it was as good as usual.  And for my entree I ordered the chicken limone which I have gotten before - it had no flavor at all, I wasnt even sure if the sauce was really on there, and it made me feel a little sick later too.  So the service was great, but like I always say, I dont go out to places for service, I go to restaurants to eat, and it was just not good - not good at all.

Food: Only been here a handful of times with friends or roommate. Do wish it was in Riverside, (it's like a 5 minute drive but the traffic on the 60 at that part sucks every time we went). When I went with my roommates I usually get a burger and potato wedges. Juicy good sized burger and good amount of potato, the only way I finish everything is if I haven't eaten all day. The couple times I've went with my friends we were a bigger party of about 10, we would grab two orders of spinach dip, 3 pizzas (great white, bbq chicken and meat lovers) and the pizookie platter. Everything comes out delicious and within a reasonable amount of time. Love their house brew beers as well, a different change in flavor for the pallet. Note: try to Irish rootbeer if you want a sweet alcoholic dessert drink.  Service: Never had a good experience with service here. The times I've been here with a big party has always been a mission to get seating. Understandable that we come around the latter part of dinner rush and seating is hard for a big party but when we do go inside to our table half of the restaurant is pretty empty. Their position of customers isn't exactly the best and doesn't maximize seating arrangement. They sat us in the middle isle, combining several tables, and to be honest we could have asked for 2 booths next to each other to save the time. I will them credit that they were quick with clearing our table so we can sit and converse freely.  Location: In the large shopping plaza right off the freeway.

Tiffany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",863,433,1378,2.0,8/24/2009,"**BIRTHDAY (BIG GROUP) REVIEW** I've been to BJ's plenty of times for dinner and drinks and had a fine time, but I had a rather different experience when I went last night for my buddy's birthday, so I thought it deserved its own review... SEATING: We had reservations for 14, so you would think they would set aside tables for us... nope.  We had to wait almost half an hour for people to get up so that they could put tables together for us.  We were huuunnngry by the time we finally sat down. SERVICE: Our waitress was very friendly and helpful... that's the only good thing I can say.  Salads came out at odd times (some early, some with meals), food took a long time.  Drinks took a long time as well.  ALSO, the bartender didn't know the recipe for the drink I wanted... and it was a standard IBA drink!  Grr. FOOD: Yes, the food was good.  Thank goodness.  My boyfriend devoured his full rack of ribs (monstrous-looking!) and I really liked my fries and burger melt.  Well-seasoned, well-cooked.  I was impressed that they cooked my burger patty correctly.  I sampled my friend's pizookie (some kind of triple-chocolate thing) and it was orgasmic aaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  So rich and yet not overwhelming. BIRTHDAY TREAT:  My birthday buddy got 2 pizookies with candles (why 2? I don't know... and I also don't know if they were free or if someone paid), and the waiters came over to sing.  Very cute. PAYMENT:  Pain in the ass.  We wanted separate checks and the waitress said that would be totally fine, but 1) she couldn't print just one for my friends who wanted to leave early, so they had to wait for all the checks to get printed and 2) it took FOREVER for them to print out all the checks and do that stuff.  The waitress apologized and said it always takes a long time to do this.  Now, I don't understand what system they're using, but I have never been to another restaurant where they've taken so damn long to do this.

Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,360,4.0,12/19/2011,"Needed a Girl`s Night Out and met up with some friends at Bj`s. Sat in the bar area because they had a happy hour, but we couldn`t order just yet because their happy hour started at 3pm. Ordered a Mango Iced Tea and a Strawberry Lemonade and started with one of their small bites while we waited for another friend to show up. We ordered two Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salads because their small bites, are literally, small bites. Small plates that are a perfect appetizer for one. It was very good. Tasted better than I thought it was going to taste. The fact that the menu said ""fresh,"" I hesitated a little because it sometimes isn`t fresh as they say, but my friend ensured me that it was good. And she was right. The small balls of mozzarella are soft and tender. The cherry tomatoes are cut into quarters and are really juicy and sweet. The salad also comes with basil and red onions. To top it off, they drizzle a balsamic glaze over everything and it`s pretty good. When our other friend finally arrived, she got a raspberry lemonade and started with the Avocado Eggrolls (now that it was happy hour), which seems to be a favorite at Bj`s. I love avocado and the many times I`ve been to Bj`s, I`ve never ordered them. Now`s my chance to finally try them after all this time. We also ordered our entrees. We each got a sandwich. I got the Grilled Chicken Club (without bacon) and my friends got the California Chicken Sandwich and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, all with shoestring fries. As we chit-chatted for a while, the Avocado Eggrolls came out and they looked really good. They are stuffed with tons of avocado, cream cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes and they come with this sweet sauce to dip with. For the first time having them, I have to say, it is now a favorite of mine too. When our sandwiches came out, I was ready to dig in. Mine had grilled chicken breast with avocado, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and a roasted garlic mayonnaise. Yummy. My friend who got the California Chicken sandwich had grilled chicken breast, avocado, green chiles, jack cheese, with chipotle mayo and ranch dressing. And my other friend who got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, hers had crispy fried pieces of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and honey mustard.

Jonathan O.,"Riverside, CA",32,17,3,5.0,5/26/2013,"I am a regular at BJ's, and I've been to quite a few in the SoCal area.  That said, BJ's in Moreno Valley is a great restaurant/bar to go grab something to eat or drink, whether you want a big meal, something light, or just some beer. The Happy Hour menu has great bargains, anchored by their half-priced Mini-Pizzas. The lunch menu is also a great bargain with lots of under $10 options. Lunch beer prices are $3.50 for any BJ's house brews, which are, in my opinion, surpass the other beers they have on draft (or bottle).  BJ's usually has at least two seasonal/limited beers (which change every couple of months) at any given time and you should always make an effort to try them. This BJ's location also opens at 10am on weekends and provides a 'brunch' menu. Their brunch menu is solid and they have some good breakfast/brunch selections. As far as the MoVal location, the bartenders are great. I may be biased because I'm a regular, but I find that they give more attention than the other BJ's locations' bartenders. BJ's in general is a great value in terms of food (good pricing, wide selection) and alcohol (great in-house beers).

Lin L.,"Banning, CA",35,58,31,2.0,8/13/2014,"Generally, when I come to any of the BJs chains, I receive decent service. However, my experience on 7/25/14 was the very lacking, to say the least. Not sure if our waitress Cherie L (per the receipt) was having one of the worst days of her life or what but she didn't say more than five words to me or my two friends the whole time we were there. It took her ten minutes to bring us water, another ten minutes to come back after that to take our orders, and twenty-five minutes after receiving our food to refill drinks. Also, our silverware was dirty and she gave us attitude because she had to give us a new set. Lastly, I waited more than ten minutes for her to take my payment which she never came back so I had to chase her down (along with another customer) to the register to ring us up. I felt so bad for my friends who have never been there before to experience such horrible service that I paid the bill since I chose that place. I shouldn't have left a tip but I figured leaving a little bit could help her afford to pull that stick out of her ass... Maybe just even a little so the next customers wouldn't have to experience such horrible service.

The server's, although friendly, are far too busy to provide decent service. I shouldn't have to flag a busser down for my first refill on my diet coke, 30 minutes into my meal. Despite the poor service, the food is well above average. I'd recommend splitting a Flatbread pizza along with their more traditional deep dish tomato pizzas, as both kinds are hot and delicious. If you love avocado then get the Egg Rolls as well.   Of course anyone who has ever been to BJ's knows to save room for desert. I have yet to get tired of the chocolate chip pazookie.

I didn't complain or send food but because we were with my better halves business associate but I should have said something. Today wasn't any better. They are short on staff and everyone is busy and we felt rushed to order. I had the ahi seared salad. It looked nothing like the photo in the menu. The wontons on top of the salad ( I thought they were old onion strings) were way passed their use by date. The salad was soaked in a very vinegary dressing. It was sent back and i didn't order anything else. Looks like another chain restaurant has gone by the way side. Everyone is cutting back and using gmo foods with no taste.

Rick K.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,552,22,4.0,5/17/2007,"I went to BJ's in Moreno Valley when they first openned a few years ago, and back then it was a huge success. People would wait 45 minutes to be seated. I suppose things haven't changed much since then.  What I like about BJ's, that one in particular, is that the service is impecable... second to none (in terms of franchises). The Chicago deepdish pizza is very good, and price is okay (not the cheapest place). The interior decor is great (as well as the outside). I don't know much about other locations, but this one in particular was very grand in every way, shape of form.  The service was the best. Even today, i reminisce of the time when i went to BJ's in Moreno Valley and ordered a small pizza. The waitress brought a medium one instead... so I told her ""look, i ordered a small, not a medium."" The nice thing to do would be for her to let me have the pizza and just charge the small... but surprisingly, NOT ONLY WAS MY MEDIUM PIZZA ON THE HOUSE, BUT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A SMALL ONE TO GO!!! how cool is that? from that point on, my trust iin this chain has grown immensely, and I have regarded it with the outmost respect.  I enjouyed the several levels of seats and the enourmous multi plasma screen TVs.  Their famous dessert, the Pizookie, is not exactly what you call the most unique dessert, but it's certainly a crowd pleaser. I am personally not fond of Cookies and Vanilla ice cream, but my friends are.  If you go, you should probably try the BBQ CHicken Pizza (which is delicious).

Mandy K.,"Mira Loma, CA",9,13,2,4.0,6/24/2011,"As many of you may know that there are not too many dining options in Moreno Valley. So when one our clients came to visit I picked BJs to do lunch. Of since it is Friday it was super packed even at 1PM. The server offered us a sit at the bar or 5-10 min wait for table. So we decided to wait, of course the 5-10 min ended up being more like 20 mins. Once we got a table we ordered right away. Within few mintues we got our drinks, however; our food took close to 45 mins. When they brought all the meals their excuse was the fish took a long time to make. Which really sound stupid since fish is most easiest to cook. I had their california chicken sandwich. It had way too much mayo (it was practically drowned in mayo) so the avoacodo kept falling/slipping off. The chicken was nice and yummy so that made it alight meal. So overall, i was bit disappointed with my choice. However, that changed towards end of our meal. The manager came to apolozie for the delay on our food. He brought our check and ga ve us a 20% discount and large pookie! Not many places can admit they messed up and offer something. So that was very refreshing. It was nice to get the 20% discount, but since we had the company card we just overtipped the server for the excellent serve although food wasn't super excellent. i pprobaly will come back given that it only nice restuarnt in m.v.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=440

The first time, the customer service was so bad, the manager gave us 20% off of our meal. We tried it out again for lunch and the service was terrible. It seemed that the staff was annoyed that we ordered the food for dine-in online. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant. Both the woman who seated us and the woman who brought the food out were ice cold, no smiles, and seemed to have bad attitudes. There seemed to be resentment about us ordering the dine in meals. The woman who brought out the pre-ordered food was very rude, not smiling and slammed the food on the table. The gentlemen who served us food was very pleasant. When we ordered desserts, first we were told we could not order beignets. I asked the server to please find out for sure if they were unavailable. She followed up and found out that beignets were available. She brought us the birthday pizookie for the birthday in our party. Then, the rude woman who initially seated us brought the beignet out. We asked her for plates and she brought us 2 plates and 4 spoons. We were a party of 6 hoping to share our pizookie and beignet. Why did she bring 2 plates? Not only did she bring the plates, but she slammed them on the table and walked away. We had to wait for our server to return to bring us 4 more plates. As we waited for plates we decided to use the plate the pizookie was on for someone to put their dessert on. The plate was covered in what looked like dried marinara sauce. They simply put a napkin on top of it and the pizookie pan on top. That is gross!

Melissa S.,"Corona, CA",228,127,16,1.0,12/9/2010,"these are are letters my party wrote to moreno valley bj's about there service... they did nothing...never called... never cared.... so Im NEVER going back... and warning everyone of there horrible service. I am very sorry to say that I was supremely dissappointed with the moreno valley BJ's resturant. From begining to end of my parties' experience with this location was a disaster. We made reservations/ called ahead an hour early and still was seated after a party bigger then ours when they informed us we were first on the list. when we finally got seated a little over a half hour later we didnt get to place our order for another 15 min. we ordered everything at one, drinks(both alcohol and water), appatizers and meals. 15 min after ordering a few soups arrived, 30 min after ordering we still were not brought our drinks and our appatizers arrived. we then again asked for our waters. once we were finished with our appatizers our water was brought to the table. ten min later our regular drinks were brought. then another 15 min until our food was brought to the table yet still no silverware. to top it off, everytime our waiter was at our table he cut us off the help another table before we were finished. we finally sent someone at our table to find someone to bring us silverware and hurried to eat our meal because we had already spent too much time at this resturant and just wanted to leave. Before leaving we once again had a waiter at our table who again gave his attention prematurely to the table behind us. We then asked for our bill and the manager. The manager was no help at resolving any issues and proceeded to argue with us about how long we had been there. Ironically he was no where to be seen most of the night (we definitely looked for a manger throughout dinner) and didnt even know who our waiter was when he came to the table. We all left very disappointed and angry at the entire situation.  Dinner should not be a situation, it should be an experience, a happy one none the less. It is safe to say that the dinner service the at your moreno valley location was the worst any of us had had in a long time, or in some cases ever.  I hope this note will help isolate and solve any problems you may have within that location and bring better service to future customers.  p.s. Our bill was a little over $160 and we wouldnt have paid for service as poor as that nights even off the dollar menu at del taco, but we did pay only to suffice your company and quite frankly to get the hell out of there without any more problems.  I would like to say that I had the most horrible service at this location than I have at any other restaurant.. EVER. My group called ahead to place a ""reservation"" an hour before arriving. As soon as we got there the hostess said we would be next, when in fact that was not the case. There were several parties ahead of us that were the same size party as us that were seated before us. We waited over thirty minutes to be seated. Once we were seated we were given a table that was only big enough for four of us to really sit at, so we had to ask for a bigger table in order to comfortably be seated. We waited for over twenty minutes before our waiter even came over and introduced himself to us and to take our drink orders. That was including the waters. Waters should have already been on the table when we sat down. Also, while taking our orders our waiter flat out ignored us when another table asked for something, turned to the other table, and interrupted our orders, not once, but twice. At that point we stated that we were upset about waiting so long and that we wanted to place not only our drink orders but our food orders as well, and we even had to ask for water to be brought out. About 15-20 minutes later some soups were brought out, and we still did not have any water or any form of drinks, as well as no silverware. About 15 minutes after that our appetizers were brought out, still with no drinks and no silverware. At this point we were tremendously upset. For one, how are we supposed to eat our soups/appetizers without any silverware, and for two we had been waiting at your restaurant for over an hour without even getting a drink! About 15 minutes later our food was finally brought out to us, mine being cold, and others not exactly what they asked for. We tried to find a manager throughout this whole experience, yet couldn't even tell who was a manager. When we did finally talk to a manager we explained our concern about waiting so long to be seated and about our drinks and silverware taking so long, and he blatently ignored the whole facts and made excuses as to why the customer service was not up to par. Then we asked for some green onions for a baked potatoe we had ordered. When the waiter brought them out they were subpar, I wouldn't have even expected a fast food restaurant like Wendy's to give us that poor quality of food. .....  ( got cut off by yelp)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=420

Kelly C.,"San Francisco, CA",126,45,6,2.0,4/4/2011,"BJ's is definitely not a place to rave about, especially the location in Moreno Valley. What I detest most about this location for the restaurant is the service that they provide. The service is definitely below par because their servers never really bother to come back and check on you, busy or not. Don't bother to come in a party of 6 (or maybe 8, I can't remember) or more because they will definitely ignore you then. Why? Probably because gratuity is already a part of the check and they wouldn't be losing out on too much if you ultimately decide to not add an additional tip. I don't remember this place being somewhere that accepted reservations, but I do know that the wait is usually long, especially if you come in large parties (8 or more people). Parking is also a pain because the same lot is used for THREE different restaurants; talk about a parking nightmare. Luckily, there are other close-by lots, but who wants to have to walk so far to their car?  The two stars according to Yelp means ""Meh, I've had better"" and that definitely is the case with the food (applies to any BJ's). I've personally tried their pasta, deep dish pizzas, and a few other appetizers (potato skins, avocado rolls (?), and the dumplings of some sort to name a few. The pizza is probably your best bet when making an order. It isn't spectacular and doesn't make me crave for more, but it definitely satisfies your taste buds. Their pasta and other dishes could be ignored, but definitely do remember to try their deep dish pizza. (this is probably why they have two stars in my book). I've also tried their handcrafted root-beer which in my opinion, was too sweet for my liking. It wasn't bad because it came with free refills, but it definitely did not score high ratings that would fly off the charts either. Their pizookies? Nothing special either. My friend has made homemade pizookies that have tasted a lot better than what I've had at BJ's on several different occasions.  Would I recommend this place? For a small group of people, I might, but otherwise, I would really recommend AGAINST this place. I also really wish they would improve their service, maybe then I would update my rating to give more stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=420

Melissa C.,"Honolulu, HI",10,66,,4.0,2/10/2009,"Good place to come to after shopping at Moreno Valley Mall and seeing a movie at Harkins. The husband likes the Totanka beer, while I like the pomegranate margarita. The appetizer platter, which consists of avocado egg rolls, spinach dip, and chips, is a good way to start because the service can take pretty long. The big stuffed potatoes are really good. I've tried the chicken and broccoli potato. I've also tried both kinds of calzones, the spinach and traditional. It's a good dish to share with another friend. If you feel like eating pasta, I suggest the fettucine alfredo with chicken and brocolli.  Overall, BJ's has a full menu of salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and other ""feel-good"" (i.e. stuffed potatoes, calzones) dishes. If you like beer, you might find a new favorite among their wide variety of brews. Happy hour is a good chance to do just that.  The atmosphere is pretty chill here. It can be as casual as sitting by the bar with your friends and watching your favorite sports on the big screen tv's, or as intimate in one of the back tables and enjoying a date while sharing an oh-so delicious pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=420

Jill C.,"Redlands, CA",54,6,,5.0,11/29/2012,"I've always loved BJs. The service at this location has always been friendly and quick, they have good food, great beer, and a cool environment. However, they almost ALWAYS got my order wrong. After a number of disappointing experiences at this location (Probably because I have a really neurotic order!), I emailed management to let them know how I felt. This is what I wrote: ""I have been a patron at your BJ's location for over four years. Over those four years, I have visited your store one to three times a month. I have ordered the same pizza every time, and 3 out of 5 times, my order is incorrect. My favorite pizza in the entire world is BJ's buffalo chicken pizza with no onions, no celery, and no barbecue sauce. Sometimes your staff know that your buffalo chicken pizza recipe calls for a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down, but most of the time they do not. I have been argued with, I have been told I am wrong, and I have been patient with your staff for a very long time. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made an issue of this. However, when I ordered my pizza with specific instructions last night, paid 25 dollars for it, and received it with BBQ sauce again, I decided it was time to speak up. My only request is that you make your staff knowledgable about your buffalo chicken pizza recipe, so that when I come back and order again, I don't have to feel like your staff thinks I'm an idiot and an obnoxious customer."" One of the managers, Brandy, was quick to respond, very kind and understanding, and even sent us a gift card! We've been back several times since, and our order has been perfect.

Renee H.,"Riverside, CA",18,48,21,2.0,7/15/2015,"Yesterday we called in a to-go order for two buffalo chicken pizzas. They were ready quickly (within 10-15 minutes) and were nice and hot. When we got home to eat them they did not taste like the usual buffalo chicken pizza we get from BJs. We ONLY go to BJs for their buffalo chicken pizza. Granted we do not visit on a routine basis, but I'd think we know the pizza well enough. This time the time the buffalo sauce was mixed with BBQ sauce. You could taste more BBQ than buffalo! I don't know if maybe they changed their recipe for the buffalo chicken pizza or if they were just running low on buffalo sauce so they substituted with BBQ???, Either way we were pretty disappointed.  Usually the pizza is spicy for me and I have to use plenty of ranch (which is no big deal, I prefer it) but not this time. I didn't have to use one drop of ranch because the BBQ overpowered the buffalo sauce so much. If the cooks did this because they were running low on buffalo sauce I wish they would have said something instead of just giving us something made incorrectly and hope we wouldn't notice. Makes me wonder if they would do the same to dine-in customers, or only to-go customers?  I will state that the pizza was not terrible, but it was not great either and certainly NOT what we were expecting. It was very disappointing. Definitely not expecting a BBQ chicken pizza with a little bit of buffalo sauce when you order buffalo chicken pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Renesha R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",64,6,,1.0,2/12/2017,"The wait was short which was lovely, however when we sat down the waitress came over and introduced herself. Trinity was lovely and very polite. We had a party of 12 so she did the best with what she had. She took our orders and said she would be back for our food orders. 35 minutes later we started to look around for her and she was getting our drinks at the bar. BY HERSELF!!! I watched her several times ask for help with assistance to our table, obvious she was rejected.  We asked for the manager and he walks over and listens to our complaints and that's it. I told him to please don't penalized Trinity for anything because she's working hard and we are not her only table. He proceeded to tell me, she should have asked for help. I told him, actually  she did.  I watched her. He says nothing and walks off. He is a horrible manager and needs to be retrained on hospitality. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and I'm sad to say that I will not waste another penny in there. I've watched this BJ's go down the drain. I wasted my birthday dinner in here and it saddens me to think I may not be the only one being treated like this. Kudos to Trinity for her hard work. I'm sad she's under a manager that just ""pass the buck"" on his employees with sorry excuses of blame. Shame on you!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Carlos G.,"Riverside, CA",0,20,6,2.0,1/15/2016,The food here is good but the service is terrible. We had to keep asking for everything. Not so busy at this time to not have better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
C K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Bad 'to-go' service, really bad.  No apologies for waiting 10 min just to place an order.  Manager walk by twice and couldn't be bothered.  Oh, and when you need to ask for the soap to be refilled in the restroom, it's not a good sign the employees are washing their hands. Update:  they even got the to-go order wrong.  Never will go to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Ron A.,"Perris, CA",543,51,14,4.0,2/9/2016,Great service by Ashley! Always a pleasure to dine here... Managent did right by discounting our meal for a voucher with no expiration date. Will definitely continue to be a customer at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Pricila A.,"Perris, CA",101,16,18,3.0,7/8/2015,"Came in for a late dinner, Ashley took great care of us, although she forgot my lemon the whole night after I had asked twice. My boyfriend couldn't decide what kind of beer to order so she was very nice enough to bring a few samples. Service was a little slow for the time being, the restaurant was not busy at all. Chocolate chunk Pazookie was amazing!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",599,1593,658,3.0,3/21/2011,"I usually do not like to review chain restaurants, but what the hell. The food I always get is a spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza. It's soooo yummy. The crust really is pretty damn good. It's light and fluffy which goes well with the creamy spinach. YAMMI. Pizookie is always good. Warm cookie and cold vanilla ice cream is always a win. Just reminder to go on your birthday for your free pizookie! (or at least fake it, lol). They have a new pizookie.. the red velvet! It's delicious! As for the other food, the other food is pretty blaaaaah. Just stick with the pizza and pizookie =) Also not to mention, happy hour specials are pretty good... $5 mini pizza and $1 off drinks, among other deals. Happy hour I believe is from 3-7 and 10-closing, depending on which day. My favorite drink to get here is the strawberry breeze and the peachy keen sangria... Still kinda expensive with the happy hour deal but whatevers... drinks are delicious! Another thing I liked about one of my recent visits to BJ's was my waiter. He was really funny and accomodating. The way he talks was like the Old Spice commercial guy. I gave him a pretty nice tip. Also the bartenders are pretty cool too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,4.0,5/31/2015,"Checked in and ate here last night with my wife and son as I work nearby and I gotta say that the service was great this time around it's always hit or miss at all BJ's but I'm happy! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because they brought me the check before we even finished our meal and desert. Almost got the 5 Stars but I will be back Great Job Crew! I love BJ's but always second guess the service at all their locations like I said it's hit and miss and mostly understaffed most of time, don't know if that's a staple of the restaurant because it's at al locations mostly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
Rex T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,16,,5.0,2/16/2016,"Been coming here for almost 7 years. Love the food and drinks. Servers are very professional and cordial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place for dinner, or maybe even a date. Great ambiance, definitely beats most other restaurants in the area. I recommend the Oasis Amber beer, traditional wings, and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Awesome. I frequent this location weekly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-moreno-valley?start=220
