43,Andonus P.,"Charlotte, NC",5,36,,1.0,2013-03-26,"I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is ""This place has really fallen off."" One of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend, is that the overall atmosphere of the place seems to be gloomy.  You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves. The food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing. The overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour. If you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5?start=20,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000002,1.4440000000000004

The first time was a few years back, and the bartender had terrible customer service (I'm not sure if she still works there, but I think it's worth noting). The second time I went, my girlfriend specifically asked for no onions on her sliders, and they came out with onions anyway. Also, my second round of sangria tasted like the bartender poured half a bottle of what ever they use to sweeten it, and barely any wine.

38,Na S.,"Jamaica, NY",1,22,,1.0,2015-07-02,"I gave one star because that is the lowest amount of stars you can give. This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar. The restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, ""well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones."" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, ""thanks for the feedback,"" then he left. The food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste. Needless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5?start=20,1.092,1.092,1.092,1.092,1.092

The manager was talking out loud at the bar to some employee about checking their schedule. Very inappropriate to do in front of customers out loud in an open space. Very unprofessional.

I did a fairly large order online on a weeknight and went to pick it up at the restaurant. When I arrived there were several servers standing around the bar area talking, I'm assuming because it was a slow night. I told the bartender that I was there to pickup an order and she decided that her conversation with her coworker was more important than serving a customer. I waited for about 10 minutes ( my requested pickup time at the time was about 15 minutes prior to this) and my food came out. I checked my order, and saw that I was missing a dessert (maple blondie to be exact) I told the bartender what I was missing, she whispered to who coworker who then decided to come over and take a look in my bag as if I wasn't telling the truth. I had to wait for another 10-15 minutes for them to prepare what I requested. I didn't receive an apology, or a thank you; I was just handed another bag. The food was subpar to say the least.

4,Cheyenne A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,19,5.0,1.0,2016-03-24,"If I could give this particular Applebee's 0 stars I would. We've been there several times and each time we left disappointed. The last time we visited this place it was so bad, we vowed NEVER to go back there again. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table but that wasn't our main complaint. It was a weekend, Saturday night to be exact, so we expected a wait. Once we were seated, we realized we were seated across from a family with a few unruly kids. No biggie because it happens from time to time. What really angered us was our scatter-brained waitress. She was totally inept. She couldn't even get our drink order right. That was our first sign that we weren't going to have a good meal. We ordered flavored lemonades. I asked to have mine with no ice. She returned with the drinks and I had gotten the wrong flavor and it had ice in it. I pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back. When she arrived for the second time, she had the flavor right but there was ice in it again. I decided to just let it slide. We ordered our dinners waited, and waited, and waited. It must have been 30 - 35 minutes before it came. She set our plates down and scurried off. She never even gave us silverware or napkins. We managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins. She went to go get them and never returned. After about 10 minutes a man came around checking on each table. I assumed he was a manager. We told him about the silverware and napkins and he apologized and brought them right away. At this time the bungling waitress comes over to ask if we needed anything. At that point we didn't. She went over to the next table and they complained about something and we heard her apologizing. She went to another table and they complained and we heard her apologizing again. Apparently she was screwing up orders at every table. We finished the meal, paid, and left without tipping.

No one goes to Applebees because they want outstanding food. They go because its upscale fast food, they can sit and have a beer, and there are TVs. Appetizers are good anywhere you go, and grabbing a quick burger and fries is all any Applebees is ever really good for. Walked into the smallest waiting area I've ever seen in a sit-down establishment. 4 couples ahead of me and my wife...wait time is 10-15 minutes. Not bad right? 10 minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated. 3 couples have come in behind us in the meantime, and guess what their wait time is? 10-15 minutes according to the seasoned champion they had working as a Hostess. I start looking around and see an ample amount of tables empty...I start wondering, why the hell am I still waiting to be seated? The second hand strikes 12 as we entered minute 15, and a gaggle (real word...look it up) of employees decide to stop their entire evening to go do a birthday song...at Applebees. With a lobby full of customers waiting to be seated... It's 2016, isn't it common knowledge by now that no one has a birthday at Applebees? They just tell their waitress that as a joke to publicly embarrass the people they are with. Needless to say, we walked out. What a joke!

I arrived around 11:45 and had no problem waking until 12. 12:10 nothing...12:15 he comes out with the receipt to sign and will bring the food out when it's ready. Really? It's soup and a wedge salad. Literally a hunk of lettuce. 12:30 and this is the salad they bring out. No bacon and barely any toppings. I knew my one experience Wednesday night was too good to be true. Update 9/16- tried again. Again a fail on the curbside to go. Ordered the green goddess wedge and southwest steak and black bean soup. This time when the server brought it out it had only bacon on it. I asked about the bleu cheese and pecans and he asked like I was asking for something that doesn't go on the salad. When I get home I realize the salad has ranch. I called and the manager said I could bring it back or have a gift card mailed. I said I would bring it back but decided to suck it up and eat it. Fast forward to midnight and I'm ready to eat my southwest steak and black bean soup but I notice the steak tastes a lot like chicken.

Finally a waiter came and asked the craziest thing have we been helped! I said no!! He is apoplectic and ect... but I don't care. Saying how they are short handed and stuff. My thing is communication! The first guy who sat us knew they were short could have said something! communicate to your customers . So I asked to speak to the manager. Manager never came! And we never got out water. So we left and gave our business across the street to Friday's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

19,Surbhi P.,"Charlotte, NC",4,5,1.0,1.0,2017-03-30,"The worst experience I ever had at a restaurant. My 2 friends who were US Marines came to visit from NY, and we all decided to go to Applebees. We had the worse experience at Applebee's, the server did not sit us down. The restaurant was not busy at all and many of the servers were talking while one could simply have taken the time to get our order or drinks. After the server showed, I asked if there were any vegetarian options she replies ""i don't know, look on the menu"". Despite of her rude behavior we had kindly ordered our food. She did not come by once to ask us if we were good, took at least 30 minutes to bring in water and food was taking even longer. As the boys were getting restless they decided to just leave. I hope that Applebees takes it into consideration on how they treat their customers and provide a better service to other customers in future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002

21,Veronica W.,"Dumfries, VA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-07,"Let me start by saying I am HUGEEEEEE on customer service!!! Being a local business owner I know that customers will always come first! My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) decided to go to applebees tonight. We walk in, NOBODY greets us!! We wait for a good 10 minutes before someone even decides to come and seat us. There was maybe 7 cars in the parking lot. Nobody was sitting at the bar...NOT EVEN THE BARTENDER, and on a scale of 1-10, id say it was a 3 as far as how busy they were. A waitress came to a table close to the door TWICE before she turned around and sat us at our table. She came back and dropped our silverware off and left again. Nobody took our drink order or anything! After 20 minutes of just sitting there. My family and I got up and left!!!! As we walked out. We walked past two employees that were just standing gossipping at the bar and 1 employee who was on her way to another table. My family and I are new to the Charotte area and we will NEVER go back to this establishment. Every employee on the shift of June 7th at 7:50PM needs to be FIRED!!!!! Point blank period. They were NOT busy at all and SEVERAL employees were literally just standing around gossipping.

The health department needs to be called...someone..I've never eaten at any Applebee's before but my aunt got me a gift card so I figured I'd use it. The bar was full of dirty dishes. The managers walked around with drinks in their own hands and no one would help me after multiple attempts. The place was dirty the carpet was sticky and the restaurant looked contaminated. I should've left the food there, hopefully I won't get sick. I'll definitely be calling their corporate office to beg them to bulldoze the place.  I'd really like to take the one star I gave back...but if I can't it's only because they have a place to park your car.

My family member was assaulted last night and no one who worked there did anything.  The women who dragged her around by her hair and made her fall out her chair at the bar had been there for FOUR HOURS DRINKING. the bar tender was laughing and did nothing!! This makes me believe this lady is a regular.  Management did nothing last night!! I called this morning and the manager on duty said ""I wasn't working so this has nothing to do with me"". Excuse me but if you have a manager title it has something to do with you whether you were working or not!! I am contacting ALE and have already contacted applebees customer care. I worked in a bar for years and having heard about this the women shouldn't have been served anymore. Many other patrons said she was overly intoxicated and becoming mouthy.

29,Joseph L.,"Spencer, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-07-30,"Ate dinner here on Sunday night, place looked empty. ordered the Southwest Steak + Black Bean Soup. Noticed when it arrived there were no beans and the meat looked like chicken. When the receipt arrived it said Chicken Tortilla Soup, when asked that I did not order the Chicken Tortilla Soup, was told that that is how the Southwest Steak + Black Bean Soup looks on the receipt. I also ordered a coffee, when it arrived looked like a cup of motor oil and then she informed me that they were out of creamer. Ate the soup (the wrong soup) when she came back with the receipt I told her that the coffee was burnt and could she make a fresh pot and again asked if they had creamer, she then said no and that they had been out of creamer all day. Had to ask for a spoon and she took her time getting one, waiting on some other customers on her way to the kitchen. When we left we were so upset that we vowed never to go to an Applebee's again. But I know that there are a lot good Applebee's out there because I have eaten at them. After reading all these bad reviews I am very surprised that management at this Applebee's has done nothing to try to correct their bad reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5?start=20,1.24,1.24,1.24,,1.24

This morning, the staff and manager allowed a customer to sit at the bar and play his Pandora playlist from his phone on full volume. After several comments to our waiter, the self identified DJ wasn't address nor did his music stop. My group was very disappointed in the lack of leadership displayed in addressing an activity that was impacting the entire restaurant. He played his playlist like a hired DJ and not one employee said anything. It wasn't until I asked whom the manager on duty was that the waiter seemed concerned. It was an hour and 20 minutes too late. I will not be  returning to Applebee's...

Not only did it take an hour to get ONLY our appetizers but when we finally got our drinks, the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. Second, the waitress was very rude and seemed like she did not care much to serve us as she would go walk around the restaurant instead of putting our orders in. Third, it took 45 minutes to come back and tell us they didn't have pasta for one of our meals, NEVER come to this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlotte-5,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32

Family and I went to see what the $1 margaritas were about. We spent more time (almost an hour) waiting on drinks and appetizers then actually consuming the items. When the food got there it wasn't everything together, while waiting my kids meal to get to him when I arrive I just so happen to tap the hard burnt bun turned the bun over and saw the burger was covered in hard burnt cheese. I was livid, I asked to speak to a manager and her apologies wasn't sympathetic enough for my comfort and all was done was a comp of a $2 meal. Weither you're under staffed Applebees with 2-3 Working at dinner time is ridiculous I will not come back to this location.
