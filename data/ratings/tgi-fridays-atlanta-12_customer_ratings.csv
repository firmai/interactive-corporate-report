144,Meg G.,"Washington, DC",146,450,66.0,3.0,2012-05-12,"Just how do you save a starved couple that has less than 30 minutes to board a flight?  Why, by standing outside of your restaurant and yelling (while smiling at the same time) for them to come on in and get a hot meal.  She was cute, bubbly and promised to have our food on the table in 15 minutes.  Fried green beans were nice & crispy, and I couldn't really ""taste"" anything else for shoving it down my throat.  The drinks were on par, and the food was piping hot!  Customer service was superb, and   the jog to the concourse was that much more fun...  Thanks Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

The only reason I can't give this TGIF 5 stars is they got my partner's order wrong.  However, they caught it before he could even lodge a complaint and they switched out the order with sincerest apologies.

118,Scott D.,"Glendale, AZ",800,557,266.0,5.0,2012-08-21,"My wife and I had a great meal at the T.G.I. Friday's at the E terminal. We split a rack of ribs and substituted the sweet potato fries for the coleslaw and also had regular fries (the sweet potato fries were for the wife). She had a strawberry lemonade which was excellent; I can't recall tasting one any better.  The ribs were easy to cut up with the plastic knife. It took me awhile to figure out why the plastic knife then it hit me that the TSA was afraid restaurant customers would try to shank airline personnel once they're 30,000 miles above ground. So what's the justification for the metal fork? Enough of my rant.  The server cut our ribs in half and served it on two plates with the regular and sweet potato fries evenly split up. The BBQ Sauce was just right. The only problem is that my wife almost eat all of her ribs. I was a little off my game since I was tired from all of the running around on our trip to Atlanta. I finally said to her after she eat about half of her ribs that she hadn't touched her fries. This suggestion worked, because she started to eat her fries and couldn't finish the last rib. So this place will be my go to restaurant at Hartsfield. Terminal E is not crowded like the other terminals, I would say the foot traffic was about 10% of what the other terminals were experiencing. We tried to eat at some other restaurants in other terminals before we just decided to go to our terminal and see what was there. Our service was great and they do turn over the tables very quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=100,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

I figured that would be plenty of time but we ended up having to press for our check after the food was served because the service was so slow. We were there for breakfast and only when they came to take the order did they notify us that they were out of eggs and only had egg whites. Nearly everything on the breakfast menu depends on eggs. But we had already been here for 15 minutes and felt committed. In retrospect, we should have bailed out here. Roughly 20 minutes later, our food finally arrives. My pancakes were OK but my wife's egg white and toast was cold so it seems like the kitchen doesn't cook orders together. Despite it not being busy, we would only see our waitress once every 15 minutes. By the end, we were rushing to get the credit card back and head for our gate.

79,Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020.0,3.0,2013-01-22,"Atlanta's airport is packed with all sorts of fast-food restaurants and pubs, and so it was no surprise to see that some of the nationally-known chain restaurants have opened up places to eat at the airport. I've always felt that Hartsfield-Jackson was lacking in really good restaurants, so your dining choices are more a matter of picking the lesser between a few different evils. T.G.I. Friday's is a convenient stop which offers sit-down dining and selections from their regular restaurant menu. The hostess is quite used to dealing with single travelers in a hurry, and she does a great job finding you a space to sit, store your luggage, and offer some food. The servers are fast and friendly, understanding that everyone is rushing for a connecting flight, and never making you wait for your food or for the check. In my effort to eat healthy, I skipped over the usual appetizers and Bourbon-glazed burgers, and ordered the Dragon Fire Salmon which was a marinated and grilled fillet of salmon, topped with a spicy Kung Pao sauce, mandarin orange slices, and pineapple pico de gallo, and served with steamed broccoli, and on a bed of jasmine rice. The food was served hot, and it was a very tasty lunch.... and I was in and out in about 20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=60,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
135,Don P.,"Victorville, CA",89,104,77.0,3.0,2013-02-07,"It's an airport restaurant with jacked up food and drink prices. But what place isn't.  The food, wasn't the standard quality of Friday's but it was decent enough. More importantly, they had a good selection of beer on tap. It was my last chance to get Yuengling before I headed back west. Friday's was happy to oblige.  I was traveling with an ear infection and I wanted to be good and drunk on the plane in case my ear drum blew, I wanted the pain to be a bit numb. I was two beers shy of drinking a GALLON of beer. I missed the mark because my flight came due and not because they wanted to cut me off. They actually offered to get me within one but I didn't have the time to finish it off. The place was busy and popping but the service remained solid while I was there.  In general when I'm at Fridays, you have to get the pot stickers. They have the second best pot stickers on the planet. The best pot stickers on the planet (excluding Japan, because I haven't been there yet) are in J-Town in Paris.  Get the pot stickers, and the fried green beans. I'm also a fan of anything with the Jack Daniels grilling sauce. I find that to be a great sweet sauce that makes everything it touches taste better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

Additionally our waitress was incredibly friendly and funny, which is always a perk at the end of a very long business trip. My only gripe, and it's not something I'm sure they can fix, but they use the standard ""Layout"" for tables here, which means it's not a layout engineered for people traveling with monster bags.  If you take a table for four and you all have some serious carry-ons, then you're going to have to take a moment to work on the logistics of baggage storage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=60,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.8280000000000003,2.96

I was handed a menu to look at and my first glance, I couldn't find anything vegetarian so I asked the lady, do you have anything vegetarian items and she suggested black bean burger with guac :) so I ordered it and paid for it. I went to drop off that pizza to my princess and came back to pick up my food. I had to wait few more mins so I decided to people watch!  This restaurant looked pretty neat and clean from the outside. I saw smiles on employes face which to me is a good sign that they are not going to mess up my order.

The potstickers themselves were tasty, but they gave me hardly any of the sauce at all (probably 1/2 a teaspoon's worth). Also the sauce was advertised as a ""Szechwan dipping sauce"".

58,Johnny V.,"Aurora, IL",67,158,262.0,4.0,2016-04-23,"I think the fact that a business is located in an airport should be an important thing to take into consideration when reviewing; if I had had this exact experience OUTSIDE of the airport, I would have gone with three stars.  The truth is that I'm not a Fridays kind of guy; the food isn't terrible or anything, it's just okay, but if I'm going spend money on a meal I want better than okay; however, when I had several hours to waste and knew that I needed edible food and a drink, Fridays seemed perfect. What I've come to expect from an airport restaurant is pretty decent food, pretty expensive prices for both food and drink, long waits for food and drinks, and slow service; in THIS particular environment, Fridays has done better by me than pretty much any other airport restaurant.  Now I'm not really familiar with Fridays, so I can't really say anything about how the food here stacks up, but I'm pretty sure the menu was reduced; some pages in their menu only had a few items.  I ended up ordering a ribeye (which was actually cooked the way asked) with cheddar mashed potatoes and spinach, and I have to say that I enjoyed my meal.  Again, it wasn't anything spectacular, but it was better than I had expected, and a whole lot better than airport food can be.  The only other thing to note is that you're given a plastic fork to cut your steak, which obviously isn't ideal, but is something you simply have to accept--it's in an airport (although even at Ohare they'll give you a damn butter knife, which is better than a plastic one, but what can you do?). The whiskey and apple drink I had was also really good, but exactly what I remember from Fridays cocktails back when I used to drink at a nearby Fridays--they're very, very sugary.  I ordered a second one but couldn't finish it because it was too sugary, not because I was drunk, so maybe next time I'll order one cocktail and then switch to something else if I wan't another drink.  I also have to mention my server Nemari, who was awesome--she's a doll--she was friendly, professional, and attentive; I have never been checked up on as frequently, and with such great timing, in an airport--she almost made me forget I was in one!  By the time I was all done and settled up , a little more than an hour had passed since I had gone in, which to me was incredible; I took my time before ordering and ate rather lazily.  If I had been in a hurry I could easily have shaved twenty minutes off of that. My bill, for the steak and two 'signature' drinks, was a little more than forty bucks plus tip, which isn't much more than I spent at another airport restaurant for a glass of wine and two appetizers.  The service was great, and food came out quickly; what more could I ask from a restaurant in general, let alone one in an airport?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.544,2.6

After being seated which was immediate the restaurant had just opened and only 3tables filled including us. She seemed to give the manager some backchat regarding her placement of our seat. She had on a jacket and no name tag so I had to find out from another waitress whom actually had on a name tag and seemed ready and happy to be at work. In any event...no refill on our drinks, never came by to check and see if the food we received was to our liking, no smile no welcome she seemed tired and it's the beginning of her shift. Our food was delicious no complaints there and other waitresses seemed more than happy to be at work and glad to help where she fell short.

They were slow to seat everyone, now they are in a hurry to take orders? The couple at the table next to me and I just shook our heads once the waitress left. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries.

After running from the train to TSA then the airline counter and unfortunately missing my flight, I was in desperate need of food. The hostess asked if I wanted a high top table but since I was traveling solo, I opted for a seat at the bar. Rocky, the bartender, immediately greeted me and took my drink order. I ordered a Kona beer and the spicy Black Bean & Avocado Burger for my entree. Food didn't take long to come; maybe 15 minutes. The sandwich was actually pretty good. It was the right level of spice. The fries were average; nothing that a little ketchup or honey mustard couldn't fix. The only issue was the amount of times Rocky used ""sweetheart"" and ""love"" when greeting her guests.

The service was downright bad. Our server was rude, never made eye contact, dropped our drinks, food & tickets at our table w/o looking at us at all as she walked by. Our ticket was actually tossed at our table. When we received our me we flagged our waitress down to ask for a real steak knife. She actually came towards our table, but not to it and spoke to us with a mouth full of food. Our steaks had a slab of frozen flavored butter on top, not melted at all... not even warm or soft; frozen solid. Obviously, the steak was cool barely warm. The broccoli was downright cold and the mashed potatoes were lukewarm. When we arrived at the restaurant we had an hour & 15 min to eat.
