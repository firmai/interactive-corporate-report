34,Alexandra S.,"Old Bridge, NJ",16,19,17.0,4.0,2012-01-25,"I love this Chili's.  Usually I sit at a table in the bar area, and the service is surprisingly good.  I'm a vegetarian, which means that I often order salads ""without chicken"" wherever I go, but I end up paying the same price as if it had chicken.  At this Chili's, the waiter (also a veg) suggested that I try the Caribbean Salad with the veggie burger on top, and oh my, it is DELISH.  I highly recommend trying this whether you're a vegetarian or not.  Also, their nachos are delicious - they're individual chips covered in the normal toppings - so it's a nice twist on traditional nachos and you don't end up eating quite as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold?start=20,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

26,Jeff J.,"West New York, NJ",4,41,,3.0,2012-09-04,"Not much to say about this one. It's a Chilis. If you've been to one, you've been to them all (decent food, not too expensive, salty, high calorie content, and not too bad for a chain restaurant). Only minor thing I could say, besides what I wanted to say about checking in below, is that the service here can be a big question mark.  One time, my gf and I came here, to be put in a table with a light hanging in between the two of us. Even though she was probably happy to have a break from looking at my face, I had to be moved right away. Literally, 5 minutes after we moved, a couple sat in the same table. Looked at each other, and had the same request: to move away from the table with a lamp hanging between the patrons. Maybe it was an off night? But, the servers have got to learn... wait, but what is this... They tried it one more time (and who knows how many times after we left). A third party was sat in the same table; moments later, same thing, requests to be moved, people talking about this obscure obstruction of a lamp... I can't believe I remember this story.  Ok, so next thing. When it's busy. Don't expect great service. I was at the bar during the olympics last month and it was clear, that night was going to be a long night based on the looks on the servers' faces. We knew what we wanted, and with high hopes, after about 5 minutes of waiting for water (or someone to say hello), we were prepared to throw our entire order at the server. But no, for her first trip, the waitress would only take our water and comment on how swamped she is. A second waiter came back, took our food, and disappeared for the rest of the night. A third waiter dropped off our food and refilled our waters, never to be seen again. We called it a night after the 100 meter dash.  Anyways, what I'm trying to say here is, this place gets packed. When it is, don't expect good service.  Oh, and don't forget to check in. You get free bottomless chips and salsa when you check in on Foursquare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold?start=20,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997
32,Angela K.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,52,163.0,3.0,2012-10-16,"This past weekend after pumpkin and apple picking we were HUNGRY! We decided to go Friendly's, but couldn't find it so we opt for The Cheesecake Factory. Ok it was a Saturday and at the mall around lunchtime...bad idea. I was with a party of 11. They couldn't accommodate 11 people. I said I don't care if you split us up. The hostess said it will be 45 minutes. We have starving children as well. Well, you know how they can get and me too! We found out that Friendly's was at the mall. One of us volunteered to check it out and see how long the wait   was only an ice cream parlor!  Someone in our group said there's a Chili's outside the mall. We quickly jumped in our cars and meet at Dick's Sporting Goods. my car was parked over there. Since I had that long walk, I decided to multitask. I called up Chili's and told them that we are a party of 11. The girl that answer the phone was nice and pleasant. Couldn't get her name. Told her we would be over in 15 minutes.  We got there with no trouble, it was soup to nuts! The table was ready when we arrived. I was so happy! The food was ok, could say it was great cause when you are hungry everything taste great!  Our servers were Justin and Sam. Our appetizers came out first before the drinks came out. We didn't order the appetizers at the same time. Justin, seems like he was in a hurry to do something else. It was crazy busy, believe me I know what busy is. I have worked in the food industry back then over 5 years. I probably seen Sam only once. Justin came back with other appetizers and apologized for the wait on the drinks. There were only a few people at the bar.  Finally we received our drinks. Some of us was really thirsty, so we need a refill. I tried looking around from where I was sitting...no sign of Justin or Sam. There was waitress that was willing to refill our beverages. Then briefly, Justin came back and ask if we needed refills. We told him that a waitress took the refills, so we were telling him the refill again just in case she didn't get the refills. Load and behold!!! She came back at the end of the refill order....I said out loud....""that was quick!""  For me to go out to have a cigarette when I am in a restaurant, means service is SLLOOOWWWW! Justin, I noticed checked on us twice. He was better at the end. I can't say that our waiters were slow, it could have been the kitchen or the bar also. Whatever maybe the case, as a waiter or waitress please let your customers know what is going on.  I give it three stars cause of the location, reservations, and prompt seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold?start=20,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

The food is crap all the way around.  This is a family who loves Chile's.  Those days are gone my friends.  They couldn't figure out how to discount my gift card and charged my amex twice.  I have to keep checking to see if this is going to be an issue or not.

We were just looking for some simple eats. Before we were served by our waitress we noticed she was cleaning out a vacated table picking up food scraps and used napkins with her bare hands. Right after that, we were greeted by her as she placed two sets of open silverware without any napkin folded around them. Immediately we asked a different waiter to please give us another set of silverware as we informed him of the unhygienic issue. Unfortunately, that was accompanied by a rude attitude and once again another set of open unwrapped silverware. Next came the wait time for the food. We ordered something off the 2 for $20 menu and waited for over an hour just to get it. Once we got the order, it came out horrible. The cheese on my girlfriend's quesadilla was burnt to a black bitterness, the sour cream was all curdled, and the rice in my entree was hard, crunchy and full of brown/black marks as if the waiter/kitchen manager forgot that our food was under a food heating lamp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold?start=20,,,,,

21,Michael K.,"Millstone, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-12,"We used to go to this Chili's regularly and without hesitation. But as with some of the other franchises, this one has gotten progressively worse over time. The other night, we went for dinner here. We sat for over 10 minutes before a waiter (let's call him ""Sean"") approached our table to ask if we're ready to order drinks. It wasn't like the place was that busy at the time (after 9 PM) either. In the meantime, an empty booth next to us filled up with 5 people and another waiter was over there right away to take their orders. Once our drinks finally arrived,  we told Sean that we're also ready to order. We did the $20 for 2 deal. We've done this many times before. I wanted a regular burger so I asked him if I can just get the ""Old Timer"" burger instead of the Bacon Burger that's on the list. This was never a problem before with other servers. But this time, Sean says ""it would make me uncomfortable if I were to make that substitution"". I told him this was never an issue before. I asked to speak to the manager. Instead, Sean comes back claiming that he already spoke with the manager and he'll allow it this one time. Gee thanks! By now, the other booth has already gotten their food. Finally Sean   brings us our food. As he walks over and attempts to place the food down in front of me, the pickle slices slide off almost onto my cloths but end up upside down on the table. He ""apologizes"" by saying ""ooops"" and doesn't bring a new serving of pickle slices until we ask him to do so. As far as the burger itself, I asked for ""medium well"". But instead it arrived as a ""medium"". Sean also never returned to ask if I wanted a refill of my tea or whether we needed anything. One of the worst experiences eating out at Chili's. Never going back to this location. It used to be good with large portions. Now the service is terrible and the portions are much smaller than they used to be. We were so disgusted but there were no managers to be seen or heard. Service is slow and servers are rude. We made sure his tip reflected the quality of his service. As a favor to their customers, maybe this Chili's location should continue to hire more unqualified servers until they finally close down from lack of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold?start=20,,,,,

Bartender was great. Next thing I know I hear dance music out of the kitchen. I was trying to enjoy football. I wasn't quit sure if I was on a cruise ship or trying to enjoy dinner and a football game in chilis. So disappointing. We ordered 2/$20. Beans and rice were cold. The chef should be more concerned about cooking than dancing.  So, we ordered a chicken and steak fajita combo and the steak was undercooked and fatty, the peppers and onions were raw like a crudite. My overall experience today after being stuck in the house all weekend long in a blizzard, I can not believe I had to sit through my horrible dinner on a championship weekend watching football and listing to dance music in the back of my ear. I understand they were short handed due to the snow, but this is not the first time I had to listen to this dance music coming out of the kitchen. This is a respected franchise operation and it needs to be managed as such.

We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table and were then seated. We were given menus and shortly after, we were greeted by our server. We ordered nachos as an appetizer and were given 8 chips spread in a circle covered in cheese and these muted green jalapeños. They looked like they were from a jar cause they didn't have that fresh vibrant green color. I ordered 3 tacos, one prime rib, one chicken and one carnitas. I received my entree and it was gross. The prime rib taco was okay, however all three tacos were extremely greasy. The tortilla was so soggy for my chicken taco ripped spilling the meat. I never even touched the carnita one. The rice was really dry and not very warm. I was over it. Initially the server was attentive, on top of refills. Once the food came, she never checked back. My friend asked for some extra shredded cheese for her meal. She was given a small cup, which she examined and determined some of it had mold on it. She handed it back to a gentleman who looked like he was a manager and he could not have cared any less. He never even brought back a fresh cup of cheese. So we ended up waiting some more until we were able to flag down our server in passing. She explained the issue she had with her cheese, to which the server ask us ""if we were sure it wasn't pepper jack because its a blend"" LOL OK. We're just a bunch of idiots who love cheese but do not know the different between mold and pepper jack. Again, there was no apology, no effort to rectify the already lousy meal we were having. She eventually got new cheese. Our ZIOSK (the table side payment screen) stopped working and we could not pay forcing us once again to wait around for the absentee server. Eventually, we handed it to another server just to get the ball rolling. The food is gross. I would avoid this location if you don't want to eat moldy cheese.

Im in my 30s now and I dont have 5 kids, so I dont really eat at these places very often. The quality of food has definitely fallen and fallen hard since my teen years and 20s. Nothing is crispy, everything is soaked in oil, soft, reheated. All of the apps tasted and felt microwaved for 4 minutes. Nothing seems fresh. In the early 2000s the food wasnt bad. Now its borderline terrible. Its like reheated mush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
1,Zulay V.,"Roselle, NJ",4,242,8.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"Ugh I don't normally review these types of chains because they're all pretty standard but man this one was bad!!  We ended up here on a Friday night when everywhere else was booked solid and we were just trying to meet a friend for dinner to catch up.  Got seated quickly on a Friday night (which almost tells you something's up..) but waited SO long for everything.... and the food was SLOP. Our plates were dirty, the food was just garbage, the drinks were bad, salads drenched in dressing looking like they'd taken previous diners leftovers and just slapped it all on a plate. Absolute yuck.    It was all just inexcusable. Plus we got there shortly before 7 and didn't leave until 9pm because of how long food and service took.  Never ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
0,Lauren N.,"Freehold, NJ",119,70,244.0,4.0,2017-11-11,"Wow, I actually had a decent meal here that I enjoyed. Bottomless chips and honey chipotle half rack combo w jalapeño sausage sides of corn and broccoli (instead of fries). I would order this again. The meat had that crispy BBQ layer that chipped off at the top. The honey chipotle sauce was just enough and not drenched in some thick overpowering sauce. I really liked it. I also tried the honey jalapeño crispy chicken waffles- sooo good. I had this somewhere else (sugar factory) and Chilis really did such a better job with this. The chicken sliced looked great - thick, white meat cooked just right. Really outstanding meals if you like it a little sweet and spicy.  I guess the last time I was here I ordered the fajita and I was lot impressed by the meat or the taste. It was something I loved as a kid here but I guess my taste has outgrown it here. I was also mad bc they add and subtract things like the decadent desserts! I really enjoyed a salted caramel one absolutely amazing. Wish they would have kept that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
4,Human B.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",0,19,,3.0,2017-12-19,The good Decent beer choices Good burgers and ribs The not so good Fajitas  Any chicken or steak dish the meat  they use is chewy. Not quality,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
2,Brianna K.,"Freehold, NJ",0,3,,4.0,2018-01-13,Great service!!! Our waitress and waiter were exceptional! Food was great and the deal 2 for $22 is definitely worth it. The wait was 30-45 minutes but we were able to call ahead and they sent us a link that kept updating the number of parties to be seated before us - definitely using technology to empower the business. Would recommend!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-freehold,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
