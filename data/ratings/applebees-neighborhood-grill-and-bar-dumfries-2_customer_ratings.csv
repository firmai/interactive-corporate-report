20,Hannah C.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,7,20.0,2.0,2015-01-20,"I came here on a Sunday night with a few friends while visiting the area. Two of my friends are from the area so they are used to the service here, and as most of us might realize at some point or another, Applebee's is nothing too grand or special. The drinks were good and are not overpriced. We got drink specials because of the NFL playoff game that was on and got half-priced appetizers as well. The only bummer to the night was the service. The bartender was pretty slow and didn't seem too bothered to speed up the service. We weren't approached by a server until about ten minutes after sitting, and were then told that he didn't know who our server was but he would take us. Not the greatest customer service, but I was looking for anything too special that night anyways. I've experienced better, but food and drinks were cheap so I can deal with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2?start=40,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

37,Guy B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,26,,1.0,2015-02-24,"This is our third and last time at this restaurant. In all fairness our first two visits were actually pretty good.  We were seated quickly  and within two minutes our waitress came to the table.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  Drinks came pretty fast the appetizer arrived a little later.  20 minutes later the waitress reappeared and asked if we were ready to order dinner. We were ready for some  refills on the drinks that's for sure.  We ordered two steak dinners and a burger. We asked for the steaks to be rare and medium rare respectively.  Twenty minutes later the steaks came out. One was on a sizzling platter really hot well done. The other on a warm platter cold on top. When the food was delivered our drink glasses were empty. No offer of a refill, waitress gone. She came back about ten minutes later to check if the meal was ok, and we asked for refills. She brought us the drinks and about 15 minutes later came back to check on us. We order a couple of the small sundaes. By then I actually put the stop watch on her and it took 13 minutes and 45 seconds to bring the dessert. If the place had been packed that would have been one thing. If the food was slowed down by the kitchen that would have been understandable, but when my sundae was delivered the ice cream was already completely melted!

I am a waitress myself so I'm usually pretty understanding and lenient but it was ridiculous to see our waitress gabbing with the other waiters long before she actually put our order in.

We stopped to grab a ""quick"" bite because we had 4 hungry kids. I usually wipe the table with disposable wipes because my baby eats off the table- the table was so disturbingly dirty - Absolutely filthy- If the traffic hadn't been so bad, we would have walked out. The floor is so greasy it's slippery.  This place needs to be shut down. We actually had a great waiter- Travis, I think. He needed better training (like don't put anything in front of a baby, especially not drinks), but was a great guy. This place is WAY beneath him. Food was marginal at best. I couldn't eat my dinner bc it was so greasy, but the kids stuff was normal Applebee's quality. We waited 10 min for high chair, 20 min for dinner and 20 minutes for a check. OMG. Never again.

Today I placed an online order around 2pm to avoid the terrible on site experience.  My husband went to pick up the order at 2:30pm and they said the order was non existent.  My husband called me to tell me this and I told him that I would forward him the confirmation email for the order.  He approached them again with this information and this time they said that they no longer served one of the sandwiches that I had ordered.  Okay, if that was the case then how come I never got a phone call or email requesting for me to update my order before they could proceed?  I was lucky that I did not pay for the order online.  I told my husband to cancel it and that we would get food from elsewhere.   I just tried to submit my complaint on their website but the site gave me an error.  Fix your damn website and update the content.  If you're no longer serving certain items, then you need to remove them.  If you don't update your site, then you better make sure that your employees are able to follow up with customers about it.  If you won't allow customers to submit complaints directly, then take out that feature and  put a disclosure that blatantly says ""We don't care about you, we just want your money despite our bad service.""

22,Mare K.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-28,"Three strikes you're out. We heard there were new menu items and different promotions going on everyday of the week and we figure we see what it was all about. Well they say curiosity killed the cat and we'll this was the last straw and it totally killed my vibe of Applebee's. Again our server was great, food was ok. Loved the new double crunch wings, however my steak was over cooked and the parmesean made it very greasy. But that wasn't even the issue. There was a promotion going on, which was $2 domestic pints and more after 4 pm. So instead of a Bahama mama  I got a pint. When the bill came out they were regular priced, notified the server he apologized and said he would talk to the manager. Our server came back and said that because they were ordered before 9 it was not part of the promo.  Although it said nothing of the sort on the flyer. ""I said that makes no sense and that we didn't get our drinks till after 9"" if they wanted to be sticklers. He came back after asking the manager again in our view and he seemed so beat about what he was gonna come back to tell us. He then said he misunderstood what the manager said and that since it was after 9 pm it was not part of the promo. I said "" well technically we ordered our beers around 8:40 ish, but didn't get them till after 9pm"" he said oh. I said ""nevermind I'll just pay the bill"",  by this time I was done and ready to leave. The manager then decided to come up to the table and explain the promo and how in Maryland that promo can go till close but in Virginia it stops at 9 pm. I said ""it still makes no sense and if you want to be technical, our beers were ordered before 9pm. Also from my experience in restaurant management for 5 years, you are to honor the promo if the lack of info is wrong on the restaurant's side."" But whatever I'm just the customer right.

47,Joyce P.,"Dumfries, VA",6,3,1.0,1.0,2016-07-15,"I haven't been at an Applebee's in years and last night's experience reminds me why. When we got into the restaurant it was slow especially for a Thursday night. First, the host took their time to get to us. The server got to our table in a reasonable time and got our drink order and got it to the table in a reasonable time. Once we gave our server our order it took a very long time to get it. It would be understandable if it was busy but they were pretty slow. I'm not going to blame the server completely for that because that's the kitchen staff but she never came to our table for a very long period of time. We got our food and it was okay but we kinda expected that and the really the only reason why we went there was because I had a gift card that I've had for a while. When we finally got our check I give them my gift card along with the credit card. They couldn't get the gift card to work for a long time. They came back to the table and said they can't use the gift card after messing with it for over 15 minutes. I called the phone number on the gift card to check the balance which took 2 minutes and got the balance on the card. I told the server that there is a balance on the card why can't they just call the number and deduct the amount that's on the card. Finally the manager comes to our table and tells us that I would have to call the corporate office and get a new card issued to me...really! We are thinking we don't want to come back here to just to use the gift card again. I have never received such horrible customer service. My son is a server and had comp customers before with no issues but they didn't even offer that or anything. We were very disappointed with the customer service at this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

We showed up at 11:27am.  NO BARTENDER!!  None of the taps were ready, nothing.  A young man at the door ran in the back and a guy in a red chef coat came out and started to serve us.  The bartender then came out and finished our pour, but after wiping his face on his hands.  The store manager didn't even show up until NOON.  Haywood introduced himself, gave us our beer and menus; then went into back again.  A man sat down close to us.  Haywood came out and spent the next 20 MINUTES talking to HIM!  Never once checked on us.  The picture I posted showed his position with his back to US (yes I know I take crappy photos, sorry). Haywood and this guy spoke about him going to UCLA or Chicago University taking a degree in psychology and how to pay for it.  Ya know, I'm glad he wants to better himself, but this is a conversation you have on YOUR time OUTSIDE of work!  Not DURING you shift while people are waiting to order. I FINALLY had to ask if he ""can you take our order now?""  Placed our order 2 apps, shrimp & avocado salad and 8oz sirloin medium-rare w/4cheese & mac and broccoli.  Hubby was getting ticked off at this point about the lack of interest from Haywood. We didn't get any napkins or our dinnerware UNTIL food came out.  When it came out I had my salad to go because he was starving and waited all morning for lunch at Applebees. He almost walked out because 1) if that was 8 oz then I'm a natural blonde and 2) the steak came out WELL DONE, but we couldn't find Haywood to return it.  He was getting lightheaded because he hadn't eaten since 2am (works graveyard).  His mac & cheese were not cooked thoroughly and this picture in the menu showed bacon on it but it came bland.  It  comes out of the BOX better than what was on the plate.  PLUS there was still melted plastic on his broccoli! Haywood then disappeared AGAIN and I had to almost YELL to get his attention to pay our bill.   COMPLETE and utter HORRIBLE lunch.  He didn't want to leave a tip, he just wanted to pay and walk out.  I tipped, but I'll be dammed if I EVER go back and I'll tell EVERYONE at MY BAR to avoid this location.   In the 4 years we've lived in Dumfries, this is the 4th or 5th time we've tried this location; even after the mass firing and ""re-training"" that was supposedly done at this location shows they truly need retraining!   Haywood, there are OTHERS at the bar and a bartender needs to check on them several times NOT when the food comes out and when we have to ASK to ORDER AND PAY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

If he paid half as much attention to the bar it would have would have made sure the bar, plates, and silverware were cleaned before ""we got comfortable"" as well. I tried to engage in regular bar conversation but he was extremely short. Hasani could invest in improving his people skills just a tad more. I had more conversation with another bar patron than I did my own bartender. Aside from Hasani's attitude he did make a delicious mango perfect patron margarita!

Not this one, who scooted off to who knows where for 10 minutes before returning...I might note there was only 2 other tables occupied at approx. 1:45pm...we saw only 3 employees the whole time and one disappeared early on...When the hostess returned I quickly requested water and coffee and the standard reply was a NEW pot was being brewed...another 10min wait... With no new customers entering I continue to wonder what the employees are doing if not serving us...When our orders arrived, the food was good, but when you have to wait waaaaaay to long for it when the restaurant is practically empty, there is a serious problem somewhere...and in the back of my mind I believe it was empty  because of the SLOW service.

It took about ten minutes to get drink orders and the waitress was out of it, kept asking me what I wanted I don't know how many times I have to say lemonade? Placed our appetizers (spinach dip and Wonton tacos) with our daughters mac and cheese. These came out 20 mins later and the wontons were missing one. mac and cheese another ten minutes later. Had to ask twice for silverware and napkins. The waitress took our orders another 20 minutes after the appetizers came, meanwhile as we were eating our dip a different server comes up as I'm eating it lifts it off the table and asks if we're done. Sure take what you just saw me eating? then waitress came and said they didn't have eggs to make my fiances burger.. Fine so he asked for a regular cheese burger. Food came out and the waitress just dropped it off didn't ask if we needed anything (which we did). We needed refills and his burger was wrong. It was just cheese burger and bun. Nothing else. The bill came 20 mins after asking for it. Was charged for the wrong burger, she went to fix it and I asked for a manager.  This is the best part. Manager walks up doesn't introduce herself acts annoyed (very unprofessional) says ""what's wrong I'm the manager"" I start off telling her how his burger was wrong and she wanted to cut me off and argue I said I'm not paying 12$ for a plain burger. She says ""okay"" after arguing with me about what's on a burger. Cool but nothing was on his burger! Didnt even get to mention the terrible service before she walked away. The server promptly brought us our new check that had $2 taken off for the burger. What a joke and slap to my face.  I paid the $45 bill and left no tip. (Which I never do because I have worked in the food service industry a long time.) My assumption they will discount that Bill more to get her a tip after we left.  Rude. Slow. Unprofessional.
