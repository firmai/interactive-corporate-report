Mia K.,Los Angeles  CA,123,340,296,8/25/2017,4.0,My first time at this BJ's was years ago. The menu is now like the Cheesecake Factory's. All that's missing is the chapter page. My friends and I had a weekday lunch here. The place was almost empty. Service was slow until after we ordered our drinks. The staff was friendly and I like how our waitress checked in with us asking how our entrees were. I recommend the Enlightened Menu for healthier choices. Healthier as in your dish may have 800 calories  not more than twice that  but Enlightened meals taste good and the portions are large. I had the quinoa  mushroom with shrimp. It was great  so flavorful. There was brown rice mixed in but they surprisingly piled on the shrimp. At Cheesecake Factory  the only healthy item that was tasty was a flatbread and that isn't filling. My friend liked her Enlightened lemon chicken over rice dish. My other girlfriend got a grilled cheese with fries and loved it. BJ's also has lunch specials until 3 pm (I believe). Their prices are very fair for what you get.It's a nice looking  well-designed restaurant with many choices to please all palates and ages. Hard to resist their Pizookie but they have a mini-one now to reduce guilt. The bar area is cool for watching sports. I like the bright amber panels next to the tv's. There is also a special brunch snack menu on Sundays during the NFL season for indulging or stress eating depending on how your team is doing lol. Bathrooms are clean and the parking is easier during off hours. Of all the sit down restaurants at the Fox Hills Mall  this is probably my favorite.
Aleasha A.,Los Angeles  CA,33,5,1,12/2/2017,2.0,Wow  I regret not checking yelp before deciding to eat here. I've been to other BJ's locations before and I was not expecting this.We walk in  a party of 3  and the hostesses look at us  and continue to ignore us while they're having their petty gossip meeting on the far end of the counter (no one was by the screen inside the thing; both of them were hiding over where the menus are stacked talking away)FINALLY they acknowledge us and get us seated. Our drink and appetizer order is taken swiftly  but when they arrived the server mixed up two of the drinks (both dark sodas but one was clearly marked by the kitchen with two straws in it; whatever  I'll let it pass)Then came time to order our food. Everything would've been fine until it arrived- two out of three orders were plated. Mine!? On a fucking tray. A TRAY. cafeteria style  grimy ass tray. And no excuse given  it was just handed to me. I have NEVER experienced that from any restaurant before. Even Cheesecake Factory has enough plates on their busiest of days  what the hell!?The cherry on top was when the bill arrived. The server slapped the bill on table without a book. Diner-style. Yet  this is not the place where paying up front is expected. This is a RESTAURANT  where the purpose of those books is to -gee  I don't know- KEEP YOUR CARD HIDDEN from prying eyes. LIKE HELL I was going to just set my card out on the end of the table out in the open.Ugh  our server finally got back to the table and charged my card right then and there; I'm not sure if they're trying something new but have they ever heard of table top pay kiosks? PF Chang's and STACKED have them  as well as plenty of other places. I'm not sure if they are just in the middle of transitioning to a more convenient manner of payment  but the overall experience of paying (never mind the rest of the dining) was plain unprofessional.Never coming back here again.
Michael P.,El Segundo  CA,970,41,12,11/29/2017,1.0,WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA . Now I know that lots of the time in my reviews I have said that I have worked at this establishment which made things worse. But I have worked as a server at BJs in Glendale and our server Alejandro was by far the most disrespectful  rude  blatantly disengaged employee I have ever met ESPECIALLY when you are a SERVER! That is your job. To serve. I was in a group of about 20 and NO ONE got water refills. He did not ask us if we needed anything we had to go and get other servers and the manager multiple times because we were missing items and order got messed up.It was honestly embarrasing having said I worked at such an establishment that allows their employees to treat their guests in such a way. I HOPE someone from corporate or management sees this. This was just this past monday 11/27/2017. IT WAS HORRIBLE.one more time. HORRIBLE!
John C.,Los Angeles  CA,90,202,90,11/12/2017,1.0,"Absolutely terrible experience  beginning through the end. We are seated and wait 15 minutes before the server shows up. Not wanting to wait any longer nor slog through what we already predicted to be a slow experience  we order everything - drinks  appetizers  entrees - all at once. The ""appetizer sampler"" shows us. It\'s a terrible visual experience  with sauces spilling over and the food just looking absolutely unappetizing. The ""wings"" aren\'t even wings. They\'re just bits of chicken coated in a super thick batter - probably more than 60% of each bite is batter. I ordered a clam chowder in a bread bowl as well. There\'s barely any soup and mostly the sourdough bread. 8 bucks for that. What a rip off. The entrees come out - including a couple of small pizzas. My entree - a ribeye steak - was asked to be cooked in medium. You know  a warm pink center. There\'s not any pink to be seen. Instead  a grey overcooked piece of meat. Tough to boot  even though they claim to age the beef 28 days. Riiiiiiiiight. Can\'t get a refill on the drinks either. Get the check  the server is nowhere to be seen nor found. We wait and wait. Then get tired of it so forced to pay upfront. Are you looking for slow  bad service? Crummy  overpriced food? This is the place for you. Otherwise  stay away. Terrible."
Adrianne R.,Atlanta  GA,910,238,293,10/29/2017,1.0,"You know what?! I\'m all for spending money in the community  and in this area is where I grew up as a kid  went to Fox hills mall too many times as a kid and a teenager. But this area right here is too congested  I can never find parking. I knew it was a bad idea to pick this BJ\'s when I suggested it to my friends for our last outing and for my sons birthday dinner. My best friend got there before I did while I was making rounds in the parking lot trying to find somewhere to park. Finally after parking in the covered parking structure and walking too far just to get to the restaurant I went to the reception area and asked the hostess where I could find my party which happened to be right behind her. I walked over and waited because we had a few more people coming  when the rest of the guest arrived we told our Waiter ""James"" that it was not enough room. Oh let me add that when I got there my friend had already ordered stuffed mushrooms..... So we\'re moved to another table to the left of the restaurant and it wasn\'t enough room  so we were moved back to where we were with another small table added. After about 10 minutes ""James"" came to take our order and went to the back to put in our order. After waiting for about 30 minutes we summoned James again to ask him what was the holdup on our dinner. He said that he would check and walked to another table. Ten minutes or so they come out with our food one by one..... but the kids still had not received their food and neither did my friends stuffed mushrooms ever come out. Finally the kids food come out about another 7 minutes. We eat and it\'s time to pay the check. My friend tells them that this order of stuffed mushrooms never came. So that needs to be deleted. Finally we get up and leave walk out after we pay our bill and I go to the car and and we drive off. Five minutes into traffic my son tells me that he forgot his birthday cards with gift cards in the envelopes on the table at the restaurant. Immediately I turn the car around and proceed to call BJ\'s on the phone. The hostess answers and I tell her that my son left his cards on the table. She put me on hold and comes back and says she didn\'t see any cards on the table. I tell her I\'m on my way. I get there and I show her the exact table that we were sitting at. I have her call James and I\'m asking him what happened to my sons cards he says he doesn\'t know and goes to the back to ask The busboy..... ok now I\'m pretty sure James saw those cards when he picked up hid tip off of the table  but he is clueless now? Now I\'m pissed because this is not cool. How could someone take a kids gift cards on his birthday. I was so pissed and hurt and so was my son and god daughter because one of the cards was one she had personally made for my son. I believe James or the busboy lied. I will never give my money to this BJ\'s ever again. I\'ll go to Cerritos"
Benecia W.,Los Angeles  CA,31,51,189,10/30/2017,1.0,I love this place - I truly do! I'll be more specific  I love their tomato soup! However...THE ISSUE: Ordered a flatbread pizza all pepperoni and mushrooms w/ half pineapple - NO SAUSAGE. Pizza comes and has sausage on it. They come get it and says it'll be 5 mins. MEANWHILE  my sister pinches the side of the pizza for insurance. Cool! SAME PIZZA comes back. Someone singlehandedly picks every piece of sausage off the pizza (that they can see)  adds more cheese to cover the holes and puts it in the oven. Crust looking very crusty. The manager comes over to explain they were 'very busy' and they'll bring another; not acknowledging that SOMEONE FRIGGIN PUT THEIR WHOLE HAND IN THE PIZZA I'm suppose to eat and removed a whole topping. Listen  THAT IS DISGUSTING on so many levels. I can't possibly wrap my head around the managers caviler attitude. HOW MANY dishes yesterday (10/30/17) evening were treated like that? So many concerns...My poor waitress  she was so sweet (I think her name started with a 'D.' Cute white girl with a ponytail and a bandana on).Normally  I'm cool with the differences between restaurants and myself; preferences are just that BUT THIS exceeds my limits and I PREFER u not put your dirty little hand in my pizza and try to serve it back to me after I asked for a new one!A whole hand... WOW!
Katie K.,Los Angeles  CA,238,16,24,10/19/2017,1.0,The Food: I was not impressed by the food quality here. I ordered the BJ's Classic RIb-Eye (well done)  with a baked potato (butter & chives) and asparagus (with no pepper). I received the steak medium rare (as you can see)  no butter or chives  and pepper on the asparagus. I did order a drink prior to the meal  and it was about a 6 out of 10 based on how strong the drink tasted and overall flavor.Service: I had satisfactory service. Being that I'm only 1  they sat me at a small booth fit for 2  even though it was not busy at all (after 9pm on a Friday) and they could have seated me at a more spacious booth closer to the bar. The server was very apologetic about my food order  and was satisfactory in checking on me. I was very dissatisfied that I had to wait 40 minutes for my check.I don't think I'll be back to this location. #PartyOf1
Robert G.,Culver City  CA,19,37,34,11/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Ate at the bar and was served both food and drinks by the bartender. She was very attentive and super nice. The shrimp were made to order as was the fish.
John W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,4,11/4/2017,1.0,One of the worst restaurants in LA. Came to pick up an online ordered food and after I come their to pick. They kept waiting for an other 50 minutes yes 50 minutes!!!! Attender with pony hair (African American male ) has a very bad attitude. Kept me waiting for no reason  my food was already made and was sitting in heat box right in front of me and this idiot tells me.. look I don't cook the food.. it is in making! .. I was waiting their and he just runs in kitchen and comes out and pulls out the food which was in heat box right at the front. He just neglected and kept me waiting for so long although food was ready... shame... you have one job and you can't keep it up
Vanessa R.,Los Angeles  CA,339,15,8,11/5/2017,2.0,"Why wait 45 minutes to an hour for food? This was an horrible experience. ""The cooks were back upped."" Was what the manager  Gabby said. Really? I ordered Salmon.. salmon does not take THAT LONG."
Jennifer P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,11,11/10/2017,5.0,This is one of my favorite restaurant's in town The service is always amazing Mandy our waitress is the best ever And We Veteran's Appreciate the offer that BJ'S has given to Us!  Great Food ! Great Service! Who could ask for More!!!!  YES! I Brought My Crew! 5 of Us. AWESOME!!!!  YOU Gotta Go  i got the Jambalaya Awesome  my friends Root Beer Wings! Awesome
Je Don D.,Carson  CA,35,200,259,1/31/2017,4.0,I had a decent experience at this BJ s. The wait was 10 min to be seated. The waiter was fast and attentive. I watched him during the evening and he was a stand out employee.  The food was good and satisfying.  Pot stickers= delicious  Barbecue Pizza = Bomb.... I love that buttery crust and the barbecue sauce is just enough and hickory sweet.Fried Portabella Mushroom = deep fried crust with a good aioli sauce Pork Ribs= meat falling off the bone with hickory sweet barbecue sauce. The meat fell onto the plate and I was left with a bone. I ain't complaining.  The aesthetics of the restaurant is very balanced between bar and restaurant. Near the bar area there are T.V.s with sports channels. The place can get loud during that time. Parking sucks unless you valet. This restaurant is connected with the mall  with an outside entrance. Most people are shopping so parking is a struggle
Monique P.,Hawthorne  CA,134,6,1,10/10/2017,1.0,On Sept 8th 2017 I made reservations for 20 people for a 80th birthday celebration on 10/07/17 I spoke with Kyle.We have celebrated special events at BJ's and have always had such a wonderful experience that my mother choose this location once again.I arrived at 3:30 for a 4pm reservation and was told was no record of a reservation for my group. I was told we could be accommodated if we didnt mind being seated on the patio. The sun was blinding and extremely uncomfortable but we were told there were no shades we were then told by our waiter (who was pleasant) that he would take our order although he still had to take care of other tables inside.To start off there were 2 dinner salads served about 15 min before the next order. There for the orders were brought out in shifts. By the time 1st and 2nd shift the 3rd and 4th shift orders were just being served. Most of the food was cold. There for if our pervious events on a scale of 1 to 10 would have been rated a 9 1/2. How ever this occasion is rated at a 1 or 2. The dishwasher broke down so we were not able to get glasses of water they brought out several orders that did not belong to our group. And a steak so tough my daughter broke her tooth as she bit into it.
Rhina D.,West Hollywood  CA,3,20,16,11/10/2017,1.0,My family and I are usually here at least once a month. Today is my husband birthday and unfortunately it wasn't a good experience. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip... it was brought to the table frozen! Not once but 4 times. The waitress said they won't be able to bring us our appetizer as ALL spinach dips are frozen... we waited about 45 minutes for our food too come. then my chicken Alfredo was warm when it came to the table. My husbands food was ok my daughters food came 20 after the 45 minutes we already waited for our food. Overall a bad experience. It will be a while till we return to this location.
Amyra T.,Los Angeles  CA,50,5,9,9/2/2017,2.0,"Been to multiple BJ\'s location and this one has the worst customer service! Here\'s why: 1. Waited 30 minutes to be seated when I was told the wait was only 5. 2. Waitress (did not catch her name but she\'s a blonde young girl) did not come to our table once within a 30 minute time frame. So we eventually got out order taken by another waitress that at first refused to take our order until I said to my friend ""Nevermind let\'s go"" which cause her to be completely apologetic afterwards.3. Our first waitress (blonde girl) came back and after we informed her that some else took our order she had a lot of attitude. Later in the night we asked her if we could have some ketchup and her response was ""Did you want me to tell your server or did you want me to be your server again"" Completely rude. To top it off the food took forever to come out. So in total we waited about 2 hours to finally eat. Thanks BJ\'s for a bad night. Always remembering to never come to this location again."
Pascha S.,Inglewood  CA,0,9,5,11/12/2017,2.0,Ok  I hardly ever have to give a bad review but  my food experience last night at BJ's was unacceptable. For starters  our lettuce wrap was cold and it had two Brussels sprouts and a French fry in it  had to send it back. The pizza I ordered was not even cooked all the way through and it was dry ( no sauce)  I didn't even eat it. My husbands spaghetti and meat balls was horrible  the meat balls were undercooked and only had 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce on it. The best thing hung about our dinner was the Dr.Pepper and my Orange cream soda. Horrible dinner experience for our Saturday night...
Stephanie S.,Orange  CA,2,34,1,8/31/2017,1.0,Just got food to go from a third party delivery service and impressively BJs missed the mark on everything I ordered. No dressing  no dipping sauces  missing ingredients from each of the things I ordered. The avocado rolls  which I normally love were so soggy  even after a few minutes in the oven they were still inedible  and no tamarind sauce. A side salad with croutons from probably last week and no dressing  even though indicated on my receipt was the dressing request. Mediterranean tacos missing ingredients  cold and underwhelming. Sloppy job BJs  I expect better especially when I'm paying a higher price to have the food delivered. Your staff neglected to take care to confirm accuracy and freshness of the order.Disappointing  I won't order from you again.
Angie G.,Los Angeles  CA,81,9,2,10/13/2017,5.0,Our waiter Charles was so helpful  polite and informative! My family really enjoyed the help and the food!
Justn C.,Culver City  CA,0,1,,12/3/2017,1.0,Terrible service food took an hour to get here.... Then the MANAGER KYLE MW/30. was inconsiderate and not understanding of the situation his customers were in and provided zero to no solutions to the problem his restaurants created... never going to this BJs again.. would not recommend you coming here...
Justin L.,San Francisco  CA,499,155,577,11/17/2016,4.0,Better than most Bj's I have been to. I went for my friend's 21st birthday and sat at the bar sections so that we could get happy hour specials. We ordered a pitcher of Stella and I had the Late Night Burger. Very filling and jam packed with meaty goodness. They also top it off with a nice over-easy egg on top of the burger.The environment was comfortable. Not too many people but not too little. They had a huge tv screen that showed the basketball game which made the night even more entertaining. The waiter was patient and helpful. Overall  my experience there was good and would go back for a group event!
Joy B.,Los Angeles  CA,182,137,153,4/16/2017,2.0,Super long wait to get drinks and utensils to us  about 15 minutes. Then food took about 35 minutes to come out. When they came  I got yucky looking celery and very sorry looking and tasting Brussels sprouts. Our sever was apologetic but we won't be coming back.
Lenny L.,Long Beach  CA,50,1,1,4/20/2017,5.0,So I went with my co Workers/Friends/Family and this was my first time. I just wanted to say that I had a fun time the food was awesome and your beautiful friendly waitress Natash E was great and very helpful and made us feel welcomed she knows what hospitality is all about. look forward to going back again. Keep up the great work!!!-Len
Christian R.,Inglewood  CA,71,5,14,8/6/2017,5.0,Maddie (Madison) did an amazing job serving us! She was very attentive and super friendly! She also had a great sense of humor! Would love to be seated in her section again. As far as the food goes  the jambalaya was cold and my steak was medium instead of medium rare. Overall we had a great experience. Thanks again Maddie. P.S. Thanks for the A1 sauce
brandon k.,Cleveland  OH,0,28,1,10/5/2017,1.0,A decent Thursday night rib special gave way to neglectful service that kept us waiting almost 40 minutes for the included desert and our tabs. Nobody checked on us  our empty dinnerware or our empty drinks. After 30 mins we asked for a manager. 10 mins later we finally got a preview of our bill and an apology from the manager. We explained that we just wanted our tab and to leave. While he was gone preparing the bill  our desert finally came out. Not hungry for it  take it back and please just bring our check.Finally  after nearly 10 mins of telling him we simply wanted to pay our bills and leave  we gave up waiting on the manager. We left cash for our meals based on what he showed us and walked out in disgust.Ok food with abysmal service. This place has operational issues that I'm not used to seeing at a BJ's.
Dr Dave D.,Los Angeles  CA,6,41,26,9/30/2017,1.0,"Worse BJ\'s ever !I ordered jambalaya  the waitress asks me what salad do I want with that ? - I didn\'t want any salad or asked for it  so I asked if it comes with a salad   which she replied that I don\'t have to take it... implying once again that it\'s part of main course and comes as a side dish.So I insisted and asked - I know I don\'t have to ... I don\'t have to take shrimp with the jambalaya but it does come with it ... does it come with the salad ? She kept answering ""you don\'t have to take salad"".I got upset and asked ""just tell me if you charge extra for the salad or it comes free as a side dish ?"". She finally admitted it cost extra.So I said so why you confuse me with stuff I didn\'t ask for - if I wanted a salad I\'d ask for it!And I kept ordering the food - then she just left... in the middle of my order - while I was talking ... and refused to serve us.But she didn\'t tell us for like 20 minute so we are waiting there for a waiter but no one comes ...Till we gave up and left.What kind of waitress leaves in the middle of an order whiles the customer speaks to her ?? And leaves us to dry ??If you can\'t deal with feedback from customers - don\'t be a waitress !! You represent an establishment as a waitress - a chain of restaurants - you cannot be that rude to clients !! Period.And what kind of scam is that ? You don\'t ask ""what salad would you want with that ?"" When it doesn\'t really come with a salad - you ask ""would you want a salad with that ?""   that\'s misleading and she knew it as twice she refused to answer it properly ... until I asked her ""do you charge extra for it ?"" She had no choice but to say yes... But then she left the table in the middle of my order and just never came back... while we were waiting ... not really understanding what just happened. Super rude and unprofessional!! I would never expect that from a waitress in BJ\'s. I would definitely not go there ever again. Worse service ever !!"
Billy S.,Los Angeles  CA,267,1,,10/4/2017,1.0,Usually don't have a problem with bjs... but this location always seem to mess up on something when I'm there.. food  drinks or the service is just terrible. The front desk lady decided to put my food next to someone else's order and of course it got taken with that guest order so I had to wait another 15 minutes. Manager was great  but when I got my order I got home opened it  and it wasn't even what I asked for. . Thank you bjs.
Sandz V.,El Segundo  CA,0,3,1,7/6/2017,1.0,These STARS need to have a negative on them! Bad experience and this is what I wrote to them! Everyone.... watch out for this waitress!!!! Ask for the manager if you get stuck at her table! We work too hard to spend money for this service! Today during lunch  my guests and I experienced bad service from the waitress by the name Natasha E. We were there today  Thursday  July 6 at 12:40 PM.Natasha E. was very rude  she came to ask us what to order  without introducing herself to us... just basically asked us for our order  and when we kept her there for a few seconds  she walked away from our table as we were talking to her as if she had something more important to do other than to do her job and serve us. She didn't come by to ask us if we needed anything extra  not even to ask if we were satisfied with our meals. It was just the worst. And when she would talk to us  she seemed to be in a rush due to the fact that in the middle of us talking she would be in the middle of leaving.She seemed to have an attitude towards us and especially walking away as my guest started to talk to her about our order BURNED me up!I work very hard to take guests out to eat to your Restaurant and I just feel very upset and dissatisfied that you can allow your staff to treat customers like this! Do your staff realize that we are their paycheck? Paying exactly $53 in exchange for lunch with a large side horrible service  I would've been better off at In-N-Out. Never have I been treated this bad at a restaurant like BJs. I really hope to hear from them!
Mary C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,7,8/3/2017,1.0,Food was not made as requested. Dessert was burnt and service was horrible. Not a good place to enjoy good food. Also kinda expensive for below par food. Do not go. I guarantee that you will hate your time there
Jene R.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,10,7,1,7/9/2017,1.0,"The only decent thing here was our waiter  and even he forgot to fill our water.When we first came in we were brushed aside and told it would be a 10 minute wait (usually no problem) or we could look for seating in the bar area. When I went to the bar area I happened to see a bunch of empty tables and booths in the regular area of the restaurant. They didn\'t even bother to check. When I told the hostess this she said ""if you see a clean one you like you can go sit there"". Neither the host or hostess seeming to care about moving a muscle to move toward the table or reach for a menu. We got seated eventually by the reluctant host. Aside from that the bathroom seemed to be a hang out spot for the waitresses as they blocked the sinks and doorway. And the menus looked and felt like they hadn\'t ever been cleaned. The food was pretty lack luster.I\'ve been to plenty of their locations and have had a great experience  but this one in particular is worth avoiding."
Bianca B.,Los Angeles  CA,42,27,3,10/7/2017,1.0,Zero stars if I could. Ordered a pizza and appetizer tonight. Appetizer was $12 and tiny  but the worst part was the undercooked pizza for $26. The pizza got me sick and the manager offered us a free dessert. Ugh  no im sick now I don't want a free desert. No offer to take the pizza off the bill. Thanks for the $3.00 discount! Never again ewww
Steven P.,San Jacinto  CA,1,11,1,7/30/2017,5.0,Every one of these five stars is for Nick. Attentive  not overbearing  anticipating guest needs while still maintaining good face time with each of his tables in the bar  very genuine.. Next time we are in town  we will come back for Nick. Thank you!
Dayana P.,Los Angeles  CA,546,226,292,1/8/2017,1.0,I had dinner here today and it was just awful.I have been to other BJs and the service here is so bad.The place was fairly empty  not as busy as it usually is. Therefore  i expected good service. I was wrong.The waitress was very rude and inattentive. She took our order and NEVER came back to our table again.I had to get up and find a waiter (a different one) who could give me the bill.My drink was empty for the entire dinner because our waitress never came..My food didn't all arrive at the same time. Our side order arrived about 30 minutes later.. by that time everyone was done with the dinner. The food took forever to come out and it was cold.I will not be returning to this location.
Krissten M.,Los Angeles  CA,52,9,2,10/30/2017,5.0,came in on monday 10/30/2017 for a late lunch with a couple friends and usually i've had average service here  but today our server Julius R was incredible  super friendly  informative  and over all pretty damn great. i will honestly be coming back in hopes that he would be my server again. shout out to julius r for being probably the best server BJs has.
Sarah H.,Redondo Beach  CA,900,305,1300,6/24/2016,3.0,We ordered ahead online so that it'd be ready to pick up. I tried their new avocado bacon lettuce tomato  skinny fries (as in thin - not low fat) and added a wedge salad. You gain a lot as far as ease and convenience but the texture looses something because the warm things get a little soggy due to condensation. Still the flavor a were there! I liked the taste of the sourdough and there was a lot of avocado! Delilah! I will have to go to the restaurant next time to get everything when it's still hot and crispy. Speaking of crispy  the wedge salad was really crisp and everything I hoped for.
Jen C.,Beverly Hills  Los Angeles  CA,142,54,22,9/16/2017,5.0,Love this place if you go try and Ask for Alejandro he is the absolute best waiter the wait here usually isnt that bad deff try to joing the bj's club u get a free pizzookie when you sign up
Elizabeth G.,Long Beach  CA,0,1,,11/27/2017,2.0,This was literally are spot to go to until yesterday. The food was great like always. Everything was prefect. Until it came to pay. She brought us our bill. My boyfriend and I decided to pay through that app because it really more convenient then wait for them to pick up the bill and wait to get it back. The waitress. Ask my boyfriend if the bill was ready to go he said yes and told her we were paying through the app. But she didn't hear and we didn't thought much of it. We paid through the app and causally walking away from our table 404. While we were causally walking through the mall to get out to the parking lot we get stop by the security telling us to hold up. My boyfriend and I were lost thinking we had to drop something  until the waitress pop up and telling security to help her take us to her manager because we didn't pay. I was shock. That when my boyfriend told her Noo  we pay through the app and she was looking at the recite saying we didn't. I did let her know that my boyfriend clearly told her he was paying through he app. But she was rude and still assuming we didn't. As my boyfriend pull up the history pay on the app she didn't say anything anymore as she was trying to pull up on her system. I told her we can go back the restaurant and said it was fine but next time to let her know all rude. And left as security only apologize for the inconvenience . This situation should've been handle completely differently. But it was not . She didn't even apologize for chasing us down Or anything. She should've thought to check cause they do have an app to pay or atleast ask us if we paid through the app  instead of assuming that we didn't pay. It was the most embarrassing thing I ever had to deal with. Because we aren't the type of people to walk away from a bill. Especially when it our place to go to.
Khoi P.,Sydney  Australia,397,257,846,6/5/2016,3.0,Pretty large pub restaurant at one of the entrances to Westfields Culver City. I happened upon this establishment on my last day in LA with a number of hours to kill before my flight back to Australia. The NBA play-offs were on so this place was more than suitable with their numerous large tv screens. I asked to be seated at a table with a clear view of a tv and the hostess happily obliged. I ordered a drink and a serving of Sriracha dry rub buffalo wings. These were spicy and well fried with the outside crispy and the inside still moist. I would suggest not rubbing your eyes while eating these as the dry rub is very spicy.The place was doing a pretty good turn over however I was never rushed to finish up and I was able to sit and enjoy the entire basketball game before moving on.
Linda E.,Inglewood  CA,0,8,18,7/2/2017,3.0,Delicious brunch!! However   service was slow. The nice thing about it was that the waiter acknowledged it without us saying anything and made up for it by letting us choose a complimentary poozokie.
Jeff N.,Culver City  CA,2,16,11,9/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Came to try to have a nice brunch before going shopping and it was a fail. Can't blame the waitress for all it. The kitchen and management share the blame as well for this debacle. We were seated after 11am figuring that since they opened at 10am they would be good to go for the day guess not. Ordered coffee and was told it was brewing which is fine. But then is comes 30 min later right before the first half of our food came out. Now to the food. One in our group ordered a simple breakfast of sausage  eggs  and potatoes and some how the chef forgot the potatoes. I ordered an open face burger with a fried egg on top and they forgot the egg. So instead of taking the plates back to get fixed 20 min later a fried egg on a plate and a side of potatoes comes out. Around the same time as my daughter's breakfast came. We all finally start eating when the last person in our group that we thought may have gotten away with no issues finds a long think black hair scrambled into her eggs. That was it. I didn't have the stomach to eat anymore. Her plate was taken off the bill but that was it. Nothing from the manager on duty. Since he/she couldn't take the time to acknowledge issues I will not take the time to consider BJ's a place to take my family to eat.
Marc B.,Poway  CA,174,727,691,11/27/2016,2.0,"The App Combo was very mediocre. The egg rolls were made of dried up avocado  the spinach dip was fine  the BBQ ""wings"" weren\'t wings they were nuggets  and the mozzarella sticks were ok. The Chocolate Chip Pazooki was and always is a good dessert investment.I rarely comment on service (and it won\'t affect my score)  but the restaurant either had too few servers or it just doesn\'t have its stuff together service-wise. Ordered. Waited 25 minutes for water. Waited another 10 minutes  then the manager visited us and said our order wasn\'t put in and he expedited it. Food came 45 minutes after we ordered  and the App Combo was sub-par (see above). What\'s weird is that the waitress never came back to our table after taking our initial order."
MARGIE I.,Torrance  CA,905,699,1187,11/22/2016,3.0,Cool revolving door.Nice  dim and cozy.Great wedge salad.Lunch specials.Helpful service.
Mike T.,Los Angeles  CA,436,364,4,7/10/2017,4.0,I always sit in the bar so I don't know what it's like to get service at a table at this location. Food is always tasty and good. Happy Hour food & drinks in the bar area are great. The service doesn't always knock my socks off  but still 4 stars solid.I like their Rewards program where I occasionally get free stuff and get notified when there are Free Pizookie (Dessert) days or other specials going on.
Mel M.,Woodland Hills  CA,0,39,13,5/14/2017,1.0,I hate that I am spending Mother's Day writing this but my experience was so disturbing that I felt compelled to yelp them and write their corporate office. This review is all about the poor customer service. Our waitress Contessa never introduced herself or smiled. She was in a rush and a bad mood. It took about 20 minutes to get silverware dumped in a pile on our table. She then failed to deliver meals in a timely manner (30 minutes) so they were all lukewarm. Soggy sandwich  cold pasta  lukewarm ribs and fries. One meal NEVER arrived nor did the dessert we ordered. A female manager came to the table with no hospitality skills and made the experience worse. I read a few reviews and it seems like my experience is typical there. I wish I would have checked yelp before going. How many bad reviews will they get before they take action? I highly suggest they get hospitality  customer service training and hire managers who can motivate the staff to smile  be friendly  prepare tables  and deliver food in a timely manner.
Molly R.,Inglewood  CA,17,3,1,10/13/2017,5.0,Decided to come to BJ's on my lunch break since it's really close. Our server was Charles today and I must say he has great customer service. He made sure that we were satisfied and if we need anything while we ate our meal. Thank you Charles keep up the great work !
David L.,Moss Point  MS,1,9,,11/3/2017,2.0,After a LONG flight in to LAX we just wanted a beer and food. So like on many times after our biweekly or monthly flight we went to BJ's. The Server was nice and professional  read our order back to us to ensure accuracy (like any good server would do). Food comes out and I had the wrong entree. Apparently the kitchen mixed it up so  she took the entree back to the kitchen to get the right order. Well  it seems they didn't have my entree at all..! So I had to wait another 25 minutes for my food while my girlfriend waited so not to eat without me so she ends up eating a cold meal. The shift manager came over and apologized - like he should of. Here is why I gave em 2 STARS.. I received my bill they did NOT take off anything for the mix up or the extended wait time. I would of thought with such a CRAPPY EXPERIENCE the management would have done the right thing and at least took some of the cost off the bill. I am a bit salty over this experience  so I feel we will be finding another restaurant to visit on our future returns to LA.
Leah L.,San Fernando  CA,1,4,1,6/14/2017,2.0,Me and my friend had dinner at this location last night. Great service  waiter was very attentive. The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the burger my friend ordered was horrible. The patty they brought on the first burger was tiny and weird shaped so much so that you could see the bottom bun. In my opinion if I order a burger from a restaurant I shouldn't be able to see the bottom bun through the patty. The second burger  the patty was slightly better  still small and oddly shaped. Extremely disappointed because we go here often  basically a Tuesday ritual for us. The only other bad experience was slow service from another waiter and over cooked mozzarella sticks. I'd suggest checking your food before eating it
Kalisa F.,Los Angeles  CA,3,12,,8/21/2017,1.0,Second time I've been here on the half off pizza day and they gave us the receipt without the discount. When we asked for the discount they went back and gave it to us  but should we have to do that?
Allisen B.,Culver City  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,8/5/2017,2.0,So  here's the deal. I've been working in the restaurant industry for over 6 years  so I completely understand not getting 5 star  or even decent service on a busy night. Really  I get it. But honestly  my experience at this BJ's was one of the worst experiences I have EVER had at any restaurant in my entire life. My friend and I (both server/bartenders) came in on a Thursday night. The restaurant was full  but we sat down immediately. Our server  I don't remember his name  but he was a tall African American fella  came to greet us immediately. He was very loud and almost robot like. Reminded me of a used car salesman. Which was fine. I have my own strange persona that I put on sometimes when serving. We ordered drinks. She got a coke and I got a Sauvignon Blanc. Then he rushed away. Our drinks took 25 minutes to arrive and we never saw our server in between that time. We had to flag down the server in the section next to him in order to order our food! I got the garlic Parmesan carrots (I really only came for the wine and a Pizookie. Yo girl had had a rough day) and my friend got an appetizer. About 5 minutes later  my friend decided she also wanted a salad. We flagged down that same nice server and she ordered the salad with him. Finally  we got our drinks. 15 minutes go by  and my friend's salad arrives. Yay! Another minutes go by. Her appetizer arrives. My carrots are nowhere to be seen. Another 20 minutes go by. Mind you  we haven't seen our server since he took our drink orders. Not once did he come to check on us to make sure we were okay. I finally flagged down that nice server (kudos to him!) and inquired about my carrots. He profusely apologized for the carrots being lost in translation  and brought them out about 10 minutes later. They were okay. I mean I wasn't expecting much  but definitely not worth the 35-40 minute wait at this point. Finally we're done. We wait another 10 minutes until we FINALLY see our actual server again. He apologizes for the mix up with my carrots and brings me a free mini pizookie (which I was going to get anyway because I downloaded the app) with the bill. When we take a look at the bill  my FRIEND'S SALAD was taken off the menu. The item that came first! She offered to pay for my carrots  which was nice. We never saw that server again. We waited another 10 minutes before deciding to just pay up at the front. Like I said  I understand if a server is having a rough night  or if it's really busy. I work at a restaurant that's notorious for 25-30 minute tickets times on a Saturday night. But we sat at that table for over an hour and a half and we only saw our server twice. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine  my food was completely forgotten about  no one asked how we were doing or if we even enjoyed the meal. I felt like we were totally forgotten about! I was so disappointed. I don't go out very often  and when I do  I want the experience to be worth it. This was definitely a waste of a night off for me. To any Manager's who are reading  you need to train your employees to pay more attention to your customers. It's really disappointing and embarrassing when you have two girls who know the restaurant struggle get absolutely terrible service. Either you need to hire more people or you need a team meeting. I will absolutely not be coming back. (Giving two stars because the bathrooms were clean and stocked  and for that nice server who took the time to take care of us even though we weren't his table. Now THAT is service)
Patrick S.,Torrance  CA,1528,415,1685,3/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,so good  love this place. food was great  beer was great  service was amazing  thanks heather!!!! did the call ahead seating and they got us in as we requested. got some beers  and then ordered our food. food came out hot and fast  tasted amazing  got a free dinner for yelping some pictures. cant beat that. desert was good  service was great  staff was nice and helpful. i go back here as much as i can. thanks !!
Chuck L.,Lunenburg  MA,112,71,1,9/24/2017,3.0,The beer here was excellent but they were out of my first choice. How do you run out of a signature beer? Oh well. I am over it.We just had apps. The spinach dip was amazing! We also got sliders and boneless tenders. There were four sliders. Each contained a quarter of a hamburger. This was extremely weak! It tasted OK. It was just very small. The tenders were shrivelled up chunks of chicken.... God only knows what part the bird it was. It was nasty like KFC! The texture was gross. The flavour was gross.I would recommend this place for a beer and some spinach dip but nothing more. I serious doubt that I would visit this chain again.
Nick F.,Los Angeles  CA,270,17,1,9/22/2017,5.0,Had the Alfredo and the carrot appetizer thing and they were incredible. Desiray and Kyle working behind the bar were incredible. Great service and very pleasant to be around.
Paul James V.,Los Angeles  CA,5,9,2,9/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I just would like to commend Jose G. for being such an excellent server tonight. He made sure that our food came out quick and also checked in on our table regularly. Keep up the good work. The service in this location has been consistently superb!
C N.,Encinitas  San Diego  CA,2,3,,3/26/2017,1.0,Worst service I've ever experienced. I stopped by with my lil sister I didn't want to eat much just got her a kids meal while at the mall and side for me. I had a server by the name of Edger was ignored the whole time and double charged for things he brought out on his own without asking. He was rude when trying to correct the check. They shouldn't doubt people for ordering little. I'm all for tipping generously  but not while being treated unfairly.
Symphony S.,Los Angeles  CA,166,90,188,5/3/2017,3.0,Yesterday was my daughters birthday and she turned 9. She wanted to go to BJ's because she loves their Root beer. Who doesn't it is good. But our experience was very mediocre. We were sat very quickly but was ignored for about 20 mins. Servers kept passing us and not a one greeted us. I noticed the section we were seated in was empty so i'm sure a server wasn't assigned. I finally grabbed a servers attention and was able to get them to take us. I ordered a wine since it was Tuesday half off wine which was cool. Food wise my daughter ordered the kids chicken tenders with fruit and i ordered the stuff potato. The food wasnt amazing my broccoli was under cooked and hard but eatable and my wine came half way through my meal. The young lady who was serving us was polite and helpful. We told her it was my daughters birthday and she said she would get a free dessert. My daughter was excited because we saw two other birthdays were the staff came over and sang with a candle and the dessert. Well dessert came no song no candle and my daughter was a little sad. I sang her Happy Birthday and while i sang the table next to us received the real Birthday treatment. To say the lease our time at this BJ sucked! Wasn't Horrible wasn't Great. They should really step up their customer service and dinning experience.
Edith P.,Culver City  CA,0,1,,10/18/2017,1.0,Worst BJs ever! Costumer service is horrible.The waiter was really rude. The food took one hour to be in our table and when it got there the order was wrong. Not coming back to this Bjs.
Monica F.,Los Angeles  CA,35,184,129,3/5/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Much better. Ordered take out via phone call. The person who helped me gave good suggestions.
Kinshuk G.,El Segundo  CA,2,45,3,2/1/2017,1.0,Worst customer service. Ordered takeout and they gave me a half order of my jambalaya. I called to complain to the female manager  who's asking me to bring back the half order which I have already eaten  as I was starving  trying to get me to drive back 10 miles. The managers name is EMILY. She didn't do anythingTo compensate us. She gave us a hard time of even crediting us for the jambalaya. This is the 2nd time at this location and 1 time at the Torrance location where they Fuck Up Take-out. Eat there or double check before you leave.
Aron S.,Whittier  CA,0,3,,10/8/2017,1.0,Came just for a pazzookie. Waited an hour. Server kept saying it's coming out. After an hour I told them if it's not coming just cancel and give me the check for my beer. They have me my check and said they don't know what happened to the Pazzookie. Wasted my time.
Nijole T.,Los Angeles  CA,3026,6297,4928,1/20/2017,2.0,Never by choice do I end up at BJs. I lalways leave thinking it was not worth worth the money or calories here. We shared a thin as well as a thick crust pizza and a few apps  which were horribly overpriced for the quality and portion size. The thick crust pizza was the best thing here  but not worth the 45 minute wait. The staff was also not the best  long waits on refills and food. Vibe and decor is like any other chain restaurant  loud and cramped. Much better dining options in the area.
Yvon Meow J S.,Beverly Hills  CA,694,255,1616,1/16/2016,4.0,We were so hangry and was passing by the mall so decided to try this BJs. Btw  this is my first time ever to try this chain.Maybe it's a hit or miss with such a low stars review. We had a pretty good experience that I believe it had a lot to do with our waitress. She was very busy but she kept coming back to our table and made sure our water was filled and we were fine the entire time!We ordered the soup & salad (lunch all you can eat!! Yay) and the soup was clam chowder for $8.50 and mini pizza & house salad for $7.25. The pizza is one topping beside the cheese and tomatoes so we opted for sausage. To our surprise  the chowder was delish  and the mini pizza was cooked just right. With good food and service  I had to give this place 5 stars with one minus star  parking. Not only it was confusing and it was hard to find a spot. So this BJ's is recommended!!
Rebecca S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,10/9/2017,1.0,"Obviously you have to rate at least one star on Yelp but my review is actually a zero. My husband  baby and I came to this location yesterday and left after an hour of waiting for a server. My husband repeatedly got up to ask for a server and staff responded by telling him they knew it was a problem and they were ""looking"" for our server. Then we requested to speak with the manager and the manager never came. Our baby was fussing because we skipped his nap in order to eat out as a family on a Sunday and we frequently eat at other BJs locations without any problems. We never ordered or received water and no one apologized as we stormed out  hungry and irate. Clearly we will never return to this location and we will seriously consider if we will ever return to other locations. I left a voicemail and an email yesterday with corporate."
Janine M.,Metairie  LA,44,62,15,1/22/2017,1.0,Busboy cleaned the floor and 5 seconds later wiped down a table WITH THE SAME TOWEL! I will not return.
Corina R.,Westchester / LAX  Los Angeles  CA,59,345,200,7/17/2016,4.0,This place is always packed. If we are going to eat here we try to eat at off hour peak times. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant seems to be clean.I was glad to see they offer a lighter fare menu. They post all calorie contents on the menu. I really like that about the restaurant. My only complaint is that service tends to be a little slow. But other than that the food was good and our waiter was very nice.
Craig W.,Inglewood  CA,107,180,187,3/21/2017,3.0,The service was ok it took a little longer than expected. The food was decent. There wasn't anything really flashy that would make me come running back for more. There are to many other choices in walking distance from this place.
Alejandra A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,9/21/2017,1.0,I don't use yelp often  unless I have a horrible experience. Our host was amicable and that's probably the only thing about this experience that deserves the 1 star. We were sat down within 5 minutes which was great. Once seated  I browsed through the menu while waiting for our waitress to take our drink orders. Over 20 minutes went by and my table kept being completely disregarded by our waitress. I understand the restaurant was busy  but it's common courtesy to at least greet the guest that was just sat down in your section and make them feel welcomed. After 25 minutes of seeing my section's waitress walk around assisting her guests I decided it was time to leave. I did not order anything did not even meet my waiter/waitress. Didn't even feel like it was worth speaking to a supervisor. I left hungry and upset. I will not be returning to this bjs. Hands down worst costumer service I've personally experienced.
Patti C.,Austin  TX,43,18,8,2/26/2017,5.0,For the price food is good  served hot. Service was excellent. Pasta with shrimp and asparagus with garlic knots is very tasty. My husband ordered peanut chicken with soba noodles and it was very tasty as well. Portions are nice size.
Mary C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,34,,8/13/2017,5.0,We come for the pizookie! I like the variety on the menu there is something for everyone in my family. I love the wedge salad
Pat C.,Compton  CA,0,10,6,8/24/2017,5.0,Never knew this location existed until my best friend pointed it out to me. Other than that I was going to have us all meet for my birthday at the Downey location instead. Since I live near the Downey location but my best friend lives in Culver City off the 10 freeway we wanted a halfway point for both of us so this worked out fine. It was small group of us 4 adults and 2 kids out celebrating my birthday last night over some appetizers  deep dish pizza  beer and the best part some pizookie. Everything went well  we had a great server at the beginning who unfortunately had to go on break right after he took our food orders and left his coworker Kayla in charge the remainder of the time. Kayla was sweet and prompt who complied with all of our requests in a timely manner but the other guy  who's name I can't remember just a short latino guy with a beard and mustache  simply made us feel welcomed. He was cracking jokes and reminded me of that one crazy ass cousin who becomes the life of the all family gatherings. In my opinion!!!!Now moving on to the food... the spinach and artichoke dip was good but not better than claim jumpers  the lettuce wraps were fantastic  the lettuce was fresh and the chicken was cooked just right. The pizza I was disappointed in  this place claims to be Chicago style but I'm sorry not even close hunny buns. I would gladly get on the next flight to Chicago and have a slice of Giordano's pizza instead before I have another taste of BJ's pizza. Sorry!!!! I give this place 5 stars for the location  the parking and service hope to be back again real soon at least for the pizookie and another beer.
Matt W.,Thousand Oaks  CA,1,3,,11/12/2017,1.0,Super disappointed in the experience tonight. I actually enjoyed the food but the experience and the server ruined the evening. Decided to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink and watch Sunday night football. Ordered a barbecue chicken salad and a beer. After approximately 20 minutes I asked the bartender the status of the salad. He told me it had only been a couple minutes. When I said it had been several minutes he started to argue with me. He then left to check on it. The issue is he had printed the receipt and the time on it showed it had clearly been 20 minutes. It would have been fine if he had just admitted his mistake but his need to argue with me really ruined the night. I shared the story with the manager and did receive an apology. He spoke with the bartender who then proceeded to help everyone at the bar except for me. So word to the wise  if you decide to sit at the bar and don't feel like an argument avoid Nesly R. His service was a complete turnoff and probably won't be back for awhile.
Gus C.,Los Angeles  CA,32,119,265,12/13/2016,5.0,It's really hard to give this place a really bad review. The service is great  the beer and drink options are great  and their new menu caters to all tastes. It's really great that they have the $25 for two dinner option  which includes a large pizza. My all time favorite is pairing a pizza with a seared ahi tuna and wasabi salad.
Brandon I.,Inglewood  CA,27,8,2,8/12/2017,5.0,Excellent service waiter was extremely nice food was awesome had slick smoking pig pizza and Mediterranean tacos and you know I had to get a pazookie with the vanilla bean ice cream finger licking good highly recommend bjs for a good chill experience
LJ J.,Inglewood  CA,10,179,19,8/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,My server Christina was good and attentive she was a bit slow at the check time and pay time but it all gucci the food was good ...it's BJ's ....you really can't go too wrong lol I was satisfied overall
Jenn J.,Lakewood  CA,383,8,33,4/1/2017,5.0,I love bj's I actually just left this restaurant and our server Desmia was awesome. So friendly and accommodating. 5 stars for her service alone
Britney M.,Carson  CA,17,3,8,1/28/2017,2.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I\'m so dissatisfied that I am typing this review sitting at a table in the restaurant. For an appetizer we had the queso dip. The dip was bland. Some of the chips were chewy  not crispy. For my entree I had the Deep Dish Ziti: house made meatballs  Italian sausage  diced pepperoni  marinara  cheese and fresh basil. When it arrived it looked like the picture. I was pleased with the flavor on the first bite. However  there was only a hint of Italian sausage. I took a few more bites and  to my disappointment  that\'s all there was: a hint of Italian sausage. I guess they ran out of meatballs and pepperoni. There were none in the entire deep of the dish. My mom got the pulled pork sandwich. The hunks of pork were so large I think I heard them ""oink."" And instead of the meat being in the bbq sauce  it came on the side in a little sauce cup that barely covered the sandwich. And the ""crispy"" onion strings were not crispy at all. The fries were lukewarm. They brought her more bbq sauce when she asked but she has had better pulled pork sandwiches at other BJs locations. There were 4 other people in our party. I guess they were ok with their meals. Or maybe they were just so buzzed they didn\'t notice the mediocrity on the plates in front of them. Moral of this story (TL;DR): if you want to enjoy your meal  be drunk first."
Lauren Y.,Redondo Beach  CA,93,199,4,12/7/2016,4.0,Why the bad reviews on this place??We sat at the bar to watch the raiders game and the Asian bartender guy was so super cool!! The atmosphere was good and our food came out quickly.I ordered from the lower calorie menu and had the lemon thyme chicken with brussel sprouts and peppers (but swapped the brown rice for fries so no longer low calorie).My restaurant companion had the steak and mashed potatoes and a beer.The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly and the fries were awesome! I would definitely order this again. My diet coke was constantly refilled which was nice.Located inside the mall over by Olive Garden on the Target side.
Masoud R.,Los Angeles  CA,108,14,2,12/10/2016,3.0,The food was fantastic  the service was wonderful  we have a great time with our friends
Nikki J.,Los Angeles  CA,6,146,114,8/14/2016,4.0,I always order the mahi mahi with shrimp and red quinoa (instead of couscous). Absolutely delicious! This dish is a little on the salty side  so try it before adding additional seasonings. I also looooove their watermelon with feta salad. So refreshing!
Liz S.,Upland  CA,119,16,42,5/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Customer service at this BJ's location is totally awesome from the time we walked in the door right to the time we walked out they are so nice and friendly here! It was just a quick stop on our way to LAX A quick bite to eat and a drink. My food was awesome thank you BJ's and Kathleen great customer service!
Debi E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,3,8/10/2017,5.0,I have driven by BJ's many times but this was my first visit and can I just say I could not have been more pleased. Service  drinks and food was Great! The ambiance and lighting was perfect. Our server  Kathleen G  was wonderful  attentive without being pushy or intrusive. We got the baby back ribs and they were so tender they melted in your mouth. Rest assured I will be coming back
Ioana R.,Fullerton  CA,3,21,3,2/12/2017,1.0,Let me start by saying this review isn't for the restaurant itself  it's for the horrible service they have! I don't usually take time out of my day to complain but this was just too annoying Our server  Rachel  was very inattentive and rude. She came  didn't introduce herself then the nonsense continued. We ordered a medium pizza and she didn't even bring the little spatula for the pizza  had to get all in the pizza w forks to scoop it out. We only finished two slices of pizza and she comes to ask if we want boxes.She comes to bring the boxes  mind you I'm still eating and my bf across the table is done  and she hands me the box as I have food in my hand then I'm finishing up some fries and she starts moving the plate as I'm eating them...She then comes to pick up the check and I have a slice of pizza on my plate to eat it and she asks if I'm done w it trying to take it...We spent more time waiting to get in than at the actual restaurant  I've never felt more rushed. Horrible hooooorrible service.I've worked in customer service with food as well and although some people can be tough you don't take it out on other customers if you had a bad day...The BJ's favorite pizza though is delicious Burgers are ok  not mind blowing though
Meks L.,Los Angeles  CA,63,94,8,5/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"HORRIBLE!!!!! Came here to have dinner with my family. From the start the server was rude beyond words. We ordered a bottled beer and 20 minutes later  he says he still waiting for the beer to come out of the fridge. WHAT? He gives us coffee doesn\'t offer sugar. He questioned us on everything we asked for. We asked for Caesar dressing  gave us ranch. And insisted for like 5 minutes that we said ranch. Why fight over dressing? We ordered dessert  it went to the wrong table. If you not happy with your job  QUIT. I eventually had to call the manager over and she says ""we been having issues with him"" THEN FIRE HIS ASS!!!!! Avoid this location like the plague. The drive to Downey location will make you a lot happier. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"
Jenn R.,Los Angeles  CA,111,38,21,1/19/2017,5.0,"I\'m so confused on why there are so many good reviews of this place and yet those reviewers only give them 3  or if they\'re lucky  4 stars! I\'ve been eating at this place almost every week for years (takeout every Monday  Asian Chicken Salad is to die for!) and often for dinner and considering it\'s such a big place with such an eclectic menu  I\'ve been super happy with the food  beer  and service. The ""to go"" lady is extra awesome and always has our order ready for us by the time I get there. They\'ll even run it out to your car! But I digress. Did I mention I love their food? Besides the Asian Chicken Salad (!!!) I\'m in love with everything from their Black and Bleu-house Burger to their Pizookie desert - even their side salad is awesome (it\'s a good size  has tons of toppings and their balsamic is delish!)!"
Tommy V.,Lennox  CA,49,1,,8/3/2017,2.0,The worst service I EVER HAD !!! Upon arrival we were seated and sat down and given the menus  good so far  or so we thought. We literally waited about 30 minutes to get any service and it wasn't even busy. We had to ask another waiter for service and yet then we were kept waiting and we had to go to the hostess to ask to get some service. Finally after waiting  we were attended and got some service   thankfully the food was ready fast but even to get some water refilled took forever and our waiter was just talking to people on his other table. We asked for the manager and even the manager took forever and on the bright side we got 50% off.
Jason L.,Los Angeles  CA,615,454,879,8/20/2015,1.0,"I\'ve been to different BJ\'s locations and I\'ve had a good experience at all of them except this one. I called ahead to make a reservation but as soon as I got there  they told me that they were setting up the table. Turns out  we have to wait a whole 20 minutes for our party to be seated. So then  what\'s the point of a reservation? And it takes 20 minutes to set up a table? I don\'t think so.When we were seated  it took a while for us to order because our server didn\'t come around till 5-10 minutes after we were ready. On top of that  our food literally took forever. We were probably waiting a good 25 minutes for our food. Luckily  I managed to down 2 beers in the meantime. I might as well make use of the downtime. Usually when I go to BJ\'s  I always order some variation of the deep-dish pizza. I love the thick dough  as opposed to thin crust pizza. This time  I got the Gourmet Five Meat -- medium size. What first irked me was the fact that the pizza wasn\'t properly cut! They didn\'t cut it ""deep"" enough!!! We had to spend the next couple of minutes cutting it ourselves. Somehow  the pizza this time wasn\'t up to par with my experiences in the past. It might have been due to the cold temperature that the pizza came out at. Not only that  I don\'t think the pizza wasn\'t properly made....Let\'s just say the people who ate the pizza spent some time in the bathroom. TERRIBLE. I mean the pizza had plenty of toppings  just not worth the end result....Fix the service and chefs."
Julia I.,Los Angeles  CA,118,2,,10/4/2017,1.0,Usually SO GREAT. I always get pazooki's but this time I ordered to-go and they gave my order to the wrong person. They put my order in for priority and still took 30 MINUTES just for 3 pazookis... when we received  they were overly cooked and not proportional. Never doing to-go again!
Brandon E.,Compton  CA,72,2,,7/29/2017,3.0,Great place the only thing that bothered me was the temperature was really cold so it made my food cold so only finish half of it
Kathy J.,Central LA  Los Angeles  CA,0,26,,10/4/2017,5.0,Came here for early dinner around 4:30 on Monday October 2nd. Friendly greeting and we were seated in a couple of minutes. Our server Armando was very friendly and took our orders very quickly.Our drinks  Wine for me and a beer for my son came along right away with our hot calamari appetizer. Delish! We each had a salad  the wedge with bleu cheese for myself and Cesar for my son. They were cold and fresh and crunchy good.Next  I had the fish and chips and my son had a meat and cheese pizza which came on a hot board. It was huge! Fish and chips were great  4 very large pieces of fish and a very generous helping of hot fries along with a Remoulade sauce to die for! I had to take most of my fish and fries home as I was so full from everything else so I didn't have to cook dinner the next day! Bonus!Armando came by frequently to check that all was well. Very efficient and friendly  good going Armando!A very nice experience  will definitely came back and recommend this restaurant!
Diane R.,Culver City  CA,171,47,16,6/29/2017,3.0,I've been coming here off and on since they opened. The service is okay and the food is all right. Just takes a really long time sometimes to get the check. Will come again. Our server was excellent thought!
Ricardo G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,7/24/2017,1.0,Horrible service! Took them more than a hour to take down our food. Waiter never refilled the water during the dinner. First time here and never coming back.
Sterling S.,Los Angeles  CA,30,34,37,10/6/2016,2.0,"So  like the majority of reviews  this one is fueled by dissatisfaction. My wife and I arrived exactly at 8pm and we seated promptly. There wasn\'t anyone waiting to be seated with the exception of a sizable party. I also noticed that about 20% of the restaurant was closed off. This tells me that this ISN\'T a peak time. It felt like 15 minutes but probably more like 5 minutes  our server arrived. She was pleasant  took our drink order and disappeared into the either. Our drinks took another 10 minutes to show up. Probably because she was fulfilling what seemed like the entire restaurants drink orders. So after our server had distributed four thousand gallons of liquid refreshment  she returned to take our overly complicated order. Wife ordered a chicken something or other and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Tall order for any chef. Now seeing how this place had vacant booths and was partially closed off  you would think that the food would arrive promptly.Nope9pm rolls around and I\'ve decided it\'s time to have ""that"" talk with the manager. I saunter over to the hostess counter and request the aforementioned manager. I\'m told she was paged and would be there shortly. I wait...and wait...and wait for this magical person with all the answers to arrive and eventually  my wife flags me down that our food has shown up. Praise the lord  our food is here. I give up on the manger and go eat my unremarkable food. (It\'s spaghetti so my expectations aren\'t that high to begin with). P.S. Manager never came by to follow up. We\'ve finished our meal and are finishing up with a Pizzokie  which is really the only reason to go to BJs. We got to witness this mythical manager bossing (she\'s the boss  right) her staff around in a very unprofessional manner. Kinda like the way a sixth grader treats a fourth grader. End of meal  we asked the server why it took so long and she said ""maybe it\'s because we\'re busy"". I pointed out that part of the restaurant wasn\'t being used and there are many unused tables. We paid our bill and leave. We\'ve been to this location several times and the ONLY thing that gets us in the door is some kind of incentive (tonight\'s was a bogo). It\'s definitely not worth the wait  the food is mediocre  the service is pretty much non existent. Unfortunate BJs  you\'re not that good and you\'re management reflects that  all the way down to the servers. (On a side note  my wife said the chicken was juicy...cold but juicy)"
Jeff S.,Los Angeles  CA,57,109,55,12/11/2016,3.0,As with all restaurants attached to a mall(or near a mall) you need to holster your expectations of service and food/drink.  Luckily  if you keep you expectations at a reasonable level you might be pleasantly surprised. The menu is way to big to actually do everything to perfection  but the dishes we ordered weren't bad. (Ginger salmon & Cobb salad. If you have a gluten allergy you will probably have to order with a manager. Also  the name is weird; Just sayin'.
Johnny S.,Los Angeles  CA,48,1,,4/29/2017,5.0,Wow  what an amazing experience. After a long week I just wanted to spend a Friday night watching a few sports games and enjoy a nice meal and adult beverage. I was initially greeted by a phenomenal waitress named Courtney who was very personable and seemed to genuinely care about my experience. She recommended the chicken lettuce wraps and tomato basil soup  which were absolutely delicious. I was able to enjoy baseball tonight highlights on one TV and watch the NBA playoffs on another  while enjoying a Jeremiah Red (what else can a man want?!) recommended to me by Courtney. This girl knows what she's talking about! The Jeremiah Red is a delicious Irish red ale brewed by BJs  which I will be ordering regularly in future visits. Weird  but after a long week I feel like a night at this BJs has put years back on my life. Going to have to make BJs a regular Friday night ritual!
Victoria T.,Inglewood  CA,181,179,777,6/11/2016,2.0,Their service and staff I think needs to take some type of personality and customer service courses. For over an hour  no one came to our table to check on us or see if we needed anything. Any items ordered were done because we walked to the bar and got it ourselves. That's so unacceptable. I saw over 20 servers there too. This is why I am sticking to the Woodland Hills BJ
Asuna F.,WINNETKA  CA,2,18,13,5/13/2017,5.0,The service was wonderful! The staff was extremely friendly  always smiling. They put customers first  according to my experience. The food was cooked to perfection  I couldn't have had better Lemon pepper wings in my life. The wait for a table wasn't long  which is wonderful if you're eating for a special occasion such as mother's day. The place is extremely clean and I would definitely come again.
Brittany S.,Hawthorne  CA,12,107,41,4/10/2017,1.0,Waited 20 minutes for an appetizer to come out. My calamari was not fresh and then the wait to get my main order took 15 extra minutes to get back. They had everyone waiting  even people that came here first before us.
Bill P.,Inglewood  CA,2,26,,9/13/2017,5.0,The food is excellent My wife and I tried it and its a sports bar / eatery ...the service is fantastic. The Sin City location to me is the bee's knees.
Alejandro R.,Fox Hills  Culver City  CA,28,1,,9/27/2017,1.0,So I walk into this restaurant with my wife and 4 month old daughter  I was going to treat my wife for dinner and we walked in and asked for a table for two and a stroller and the employee at the desk said that we couldn't eat there do to the fact that we had a stroller. I was shocked that she had the nerve to say that. They wouldn't let us eat at a family restaurant because we had a newborn in a stroller. She basically said that we had to leave the stroller outside in the lobby while we had dinner. So she basically wanted us to hold our newborn daughter in our arms while we had our dinner. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. This is the last Draw. We've had problems here before mainly due to the fact that they take forever to seat you and bring your food out cold. I've never been treated so badly at a restaurant like the cheesecake factory  he'll not even norms. They lost a customer for sure.
Arion R.,Chino Hills  CA,292,7,2,12/11/2016,1.0,I've been to this location a few times and have been disappointed every time. Customer service is lacking and the food is mediocre. A few nights ago  I ordered a medium cheese pizza w/no tomatoes  a small BBQ pizza  and dessert. Arrived at pickup time and still had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the cheese pizza. (How hard is it to make?) Once home  I see they barely made the pizza at all! There was dry  burnt cheese in some parts and wet cheese on uncooked dough in others. AND they did not even put the cheese on the entire pizza. I was so disappointed as I was very HANGRY. I wanted to call and take it back  but did not have the energy as it was 9pm. I used to love BJs  but moving to LA has taught me to never eat at the chains.
Bill M.,Studio City  Los Angeles  CA,43,29,138,8/29/2016,1.0,"Arrival was great  the hostess stand gentleman was gracious; however  it was all downhill from there. From the moment we were seated. The booth was wet  I had to dry my seat. it took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were in there section. I asked for a new napkin - only to be given attitude. It took approximately 15 minutes for the waiter to return  ""Alexis"". Condescending and not very accommodating. We had to wait another 10 minutes for our drinks  the place was not that busy. Management  a bit of training is needed on prioritizing lots of employees  nonchalant attitude and demeanor. They brought my appetizer; no plates. I got up and asked the bartender for two plates  he handed them to me  he handed me two dirty dishes. Seriously. Please take care of your customers better. Our tab was $60 for two dinners and two drinks. Not wroth the price or service. Much rather go to Yardhouse or CPK!Warm regards Not coming back customer."
matthew w.,Los Angeles  CA,1,20,9,10/20/2016,2.0,Been here a few times and the place is just so so. But today  they really dropped the ball. Looks like they had a big party of like 20 and they didn't know how to handle everything. There was a gap between the service side and the kitchen and it really messed everything up. When we finally got seated it took around 15 minutes to order. When we finally ordered it took another 30 minutes... Just to get our salads. Haven't even taken a bit of our salad  and our main course is up. Asked for my steak medium rare  wasn't even cooked. Had to send it back and of course that was anther 15 minutes. By then I wasn't even hungry anymore. It was just a poor  disappointing experience to say the least. I do want to mention Dareisha for working her butt off to try and satisfy us. It wasn't her fault everything was so out of order  she did try her best. Kudos to youBut overall  it wasn't worth the time  the wait  or the hassle. They have a food court here and I'll be sticking with that
Shaniqua W.,Dallas  TX,84,7,,4/21/2017,4.0,The pazookie is always BOMB!! Christian and Contessa are amazing. Contessa gave awesome service :)
Karen D.,Los Angeles  CA,39,14,1,1/25/2017,5.0,Came here last night with my son & two good friends  I had an amazing experience. As soon as we walked in the door  we were greeted and sat. Our waiter Steven was extraordinary HUGE thanks!! I had the Chicken Club & it's was absolutely satisfying in every way  the fried OH MY GAAAWD the ctispy thin fries were so cute and crunchy I LOVED THEM!!!!My son had a slider and ice cream which was heaven to him lol It was my first time there & I will definitely be going back.
Derek K.,Yokohama  Japan,366,503,1335,4/15/2015,1.0,"Rating: 20/100 ptsBJ\'s is a chain restaurant/brewery that appears in a lot of malls and shopping areas  and thanks to a recent company dinner  I can say I\'ve been to several locations enough times to form my opinion on them. Since I don\'t drink alcohol  this review is based solely on their food  which  on the whole  I find to be quite deplorable.Their signature ""deep"" dish pizza is a pretty sad affair. Though you may be tempted to order it  don\'t expect anything fancy. The cheese is rubbery  tomato sauce is absent  and it has a shocking reliance on low quality  high sodium toppings. It mostly ""deflates"" soon after being served  becoming more of a ""kinda thick"" dish pizza. This $20+ dud tastes like freezer food. Actually  I\'m pretty sure it is.The spare ribs are almost tasteless  and the NY steak is overly tough. The best dish I\'ve had has been their Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Though it is by no means phenomenal  coming in a light  lemony butter sauce  this was the only dish of the bunch I tried that I could actually chew without my internal ""dangerous substance"" sensors going off.For dessert  their menu touts their ""pizookies"". Although the concept of combining a pizza and a cookie sounds amazing in theory  in practice  it\'s as disappointing as it is a clumsy portmanteau. They\'re overly greasy  diabete-causingly sweet  and furthermore  not much resembling pizza. It\'s just an oversized cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream scooped on top. Pizookie? More like ""fiascookie"". (See  I can make bad portmanteaus too.)But I hate to be completely negative  so in fairness  here\'s their good points.The servers are pretty awesome  typically being cheerful and attentive. Too bad service tends to be sllllooooow as hell. It\'s not really the server\'s fault  though; try as they might  this place is just too huge to swiftly make the rounds.Most of the food is utterly diet-destructive  but the menus clearly state the caloric {mega}load of each item  allowing you to be strategic with how to deal your damage. Also  they have an ""enLightened"" section of the menu  which has some semi-healthy items to choose from.They\'re open late  and apparently have a lot of beer choices  if you\'re into that sort of thing.I was willing to give them 2 stars  but took one more off considering their prices. Overall  you\'re paying for way overpriced freezer food. But hey  if you\'re here for their bar  you may not even notice.I don\'t know what ""BJs"" stands for  and I\'m fine with that."
Tyler W.,San Gabriel  CA,3,5,,9/9/2016,1.0,This review is about the service (or lack thereof) and not the food. Our server at dinner tonight was extremely disinterested and inattentive from the moment we sat down. Between my brother and I  we ordered Calamari for an appetizer  The Italian Market flatbread pizza  Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta and two drinks (as well as two glasses of water). My brother asked for no peperoncini's on the flatbread pizza and I asked for no cheese on the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta. No plates were brought out for the appetizer  peperoncini's were on the flatbread pizza and cheese was sprinkled on top of the pasta. Had to track down our server to get my pasta sent back (he didn't apologize  but I think the general manager did) and my brother just picked off the peperoncini's rather than go through the hassle of getting another one made. Looking back  it was pretty obvious that our server wasn't paying attention at all when we ordered because we never got our glasses of water as well.
Emali A.,Los Angeles  CA,1,13,6,10/5/2016,1.0,Negative 1 my experience was horrible service we got our salad but no utensils till 10 minutes later no refills at all it took 20 minutes to get my cheese and 38 minutes for the guy to bring my check smh and the nerve to want a tip horrible horrible horrible
Nicole D.,Bristol  CT,336,1526,210,8/13/2016,1.0,I had to go here for a meeting and it was pretty bad...the food was not appetizing and looked nothing like the photos in the menus. It's average  perhaps even below average  bar food at best. It's also way overpriced for the low quality.
LadyBug M.,Los Angeles  CA,21,14,32,3/24/2017,5.0,I love to give these type of reviews!!! Great place for family always busy but waiters are very nice. SPECIALLY BA! Great guy with a big smile and so happy! My 12yr old son asked for the manager because he wanted to tell him that he has an awesome employee. I decided to write it here hoping that the big guy sees it and awards him for his GREAT service.
Gianna R.,Los Angeles  CA,10,72,3,2/20/2017,1.0,In addition to being ignored when I first arrived - the 2 people at the front desk didn't look my way  but spoke with a man who came after me. Sad face #1I ordered a Proseco. The server dropped off the unopened bottle on the table with my friend's drink. When he returned to the table about 10 minutes later  my guest asked if he was going to open my drink. He said  he'd be back -- he came back in a few minutes and opened my drink. Sad face #2My salad came first - after a few minutes  my friends's ziti arrived - then came my Brussel sprouts  and finally after a few minutes  my friends chicken wings appeared. Sad face #3When I gave the server my membership number and advised him that I would like to use my discount  the server put the number on our check but didn't apply a discount. Sad face #4We arrived around 4:45ish (that's being generous)  we didn't receive our bill until at least 20 minutes after we finished eating. He never came back to see if we need anything...Sad face #5 & 6.This is not the type of service that I would have expected. It was absolutely horrible. If this were my first visit...I would NEVER RETURN.
Lessly D.,Los Angeles  CA,3,10,11,6/2/2017,5.0,First time experiencing BJ's in Culver City. Experience and atmosphere was nice. Although we walk in around noon on a Friday it was already crowded however our server Julius was tentative to us despite the crowd.
Mikisha S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,9/16/2017,2.0,Terrible waiter (Chris) slow and inactive  it's like do you wanna work or not. Speaking low and walking slow! Shit like this makes you wanna walk and never return! I mean fuck get it right.
Virginia M.,Los Angeles  CA,36,304,314,4/16/2016,1.0,I am a fan of the BJs in Torrance  but since I live in CC  this location is way closer. However  I probably could've driven to Torrance and back in the time it took for me to order and get my meal from this place! Slow service  until it was time for us to pay--then all of our sudden our waitress was passing by every other second. Finally she announced that she was leaving so could we pay now and then stay as long as we needed. How convenient. Saw her 15 minutes later and she was still serving so I'm guessing she just wanted to be sure we were good for a tip (which we were  even though we hardly saw her  got no refills and had to clear the dirty plates ourselves). Mind you  this was around 2pm during the week-- definitely not rush hour. Subpar food. I will not be back.
Carlotta B.,Carrollton  TX,145,10,,12/14/2016,1.0,"Is there a way to give a 0 rating?! OMG!!Service is terrible and the wait staff & management team could care less!We have been seated for 20 minutes & several wait staff have passed...no acknowledgement!When we ask for our server  she comes over w/nothing to write on. Oh! Did I tell you we\'re a party of 6!!Trying to make light of the situation I ask  ""are you going to remember all of this?"" She responds  ""oh yes  I have it"". Needless to say we\'re still missing silverware  plates & sweetener for the tea! However  they\'ve brought out 2 of the 3 appetizers we\'ve ordered!"
Adenike B.,Gardena  CA,20,34,2,5/20/2017,5.0,Julius R was our server today and he was excellent ! Tried really hard to make sure we had everything we needed. My husband is very picky & particular when it comes to his food was very happy with the service & overall experience. Thanks Julius !
Brian R.,Bellflower  CA,77,4,2,2/4/2017,1.0,Absolutely terrible service. Came in as a party of 2 just my wife and I and we were asked to sit and wait for a table during the time we were waiting 2 separate parties came in after we did and we're immediately seated without any wait at all. We brought to the hostess attention which I believe was the manager and she sit us in a crowded corner seat which we declined because we did want to be comfortable. She did seat us at another table shortly after and we never saw a server at all until we were getting up to leave and go to another restaurant. I have never had this experience at BJ'S before
Cherise N.,Pinole  CA,76,160,406,4/9/2016,4.0,I wish I remembered our waitress's name  but she was amazing!!! We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Wrong move we did  because the mall was packed and we had to park in the parking garage which was already filled with traffic. Womp! We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I really can't remember our waitress's name  but she was helpful and friendly and gave us a complimentary pizookie (I hope that's how you spell it). I ordered the honey sriracha brussels sprouts. This was amazing!! I even tried making it myself (it was good but not as good as this). My fellow eaters all ordered piadinas. They said it was good. Because it was my sister's birthday she got a complimentary pizookie. We ordered the new monkey bread pizookie to join in on the fun. The monkey bread pizookie was great! It was an overall great experience.

Franklin A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,37,,8/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We'll service isn't the waitstaff but kitchen mainly they put your order in and guess what wait hoping they read any particulars and succeed in preparing them. AsI don't write reviews that often I have to mention to ask for Contessa the best server at any location I've been to. Has all wanted items there before you even think to ask  not overly pushy on extra items but does mention them if asked  brilliant! Happy hour specials are a bonus! Going there for lunch today join me
Charles M.,Seattle  WA,10,1,,9/12/2017,1.0,Wow  terrible service  poor quality food  no concern for the customer. I have never posted a review before but this place forced the issue. My only question is why yelp doesn't allow a zero rating.
Kathy H.,Los Angeles  CA,12,29,4,5/1/2017,5.0,Disclaimer.....I love BJ's so my review may be partial. That being said I do give bad reviews when warranted. I hesitated coming to this BJ's because of the bad reivew's..I guess it goes to show that not all reviews good or bad may be accurate. I have been to this BJ's 3x in the last 6 months and have never had a bad experience. The food is always spot on  great menu choices and who doesn't love a hot poozoki? The service I have had has always been excellent so no negative review here. Want to give a shout out to our bartender Mike! Thank you Mike for your attentiveness to our party! Will be coming back for sure!
Alejandro P.,Santa Fe Springs  CA,7,3,,12/17/2016,5.0,Was here last night with my friend. We were starving after all the shipping we did. Our server was Kayla M. Great server we had the barbacoa chicken and my friend the turkey burger came out quick and she kept checking on us. We ask to speak to the manager because now a days people only want to speak to mangers for negative reasons. The manager Luis came over I explain how great the food was and how Kayla was great. I told him that we had a great experience. He thank us for taking the time to give possitive feet back. We will be back and will be asking for the same server. Thanks bjs.PS. Bring back the pumpkin pizzookie
Stacy W.,Los Angeles  CA,1,27,29,11/28/2016,5.0,I love this place for lunch  alone  with the family  on a date. It's a nice environment close to the mall so you can shop then eat or eat then shop. Big screen tv's all around the restaurant so there is no problem catching a game on the big screen. Customer service is great & the food is always hot when served
Jon T.,Fremont  CA,934,869,43,6/28/2016,2.0,This place is pretty bad  the service is slow and hosts/hostesses are really slow as well. I only come here sometimes because my damn stomach craves their pizzookie. Food is average but honestly for their prices I would expect better
Ashley K.,Washington  DC,92,243,13,8/19/2016,4.0,Came here for lunch on a Thursday and was able to get seated right away. The server was very attentive and fast. The menu is a little intense because there are so many options - but once you wade through the first 5 pages of just drink options and find the food - there's something for everyone. I got the Brewhouse Burger with shoestring fries. The burger was really flavorful and cooked just the way I ordered. The fries were also very crispy and delicious. While I didn't order beer  as the name of the restaurant implies - there are a lot of beer options. This was a great place to stop in for lunch and I would recommend it if you are looking for a sit-down restaurant where you need to get a fast meal.
The E.,Norwalk  CA,0,9,40,11/17/2016,4.0,Coming here for the first time i was welcomed with a great first impression! The waiter was going to seat me and my family at a table and i asked if we can sit at a booth better and without hesitation he seated us to a booth! i ordered a strawberry lemonade and boy was it sweet and delicious just how i love it ! so i ordered a chicken club and instead of sting fries i asked for a house salad and got it ! super delicious and drenched in ranch just how like my salad . salad and calamari came by real quick . the waiter jose is a very nice guy . When my chicken club the chef accidentally put fries as well. fries were rather stale not a fan of the fries here anyways. sandwhich was excellent . everything was average . pretty decent Bjs.
Alfred L.,San Francisco  CA,210,2,,9/10/2017,1.0,Been to many BJ's and this one is terrible. Took 45 minutes for our food to come and once it did it was dry and cold. There were only 20 people in the restaurant. Server didn't give us any refills either.
John Q.,Los Angeles  CA,6,7,1,12/2/2016,1.0,Worst experience ever. Specially with that server who seem didnt want to work there kimberly g... if u get her make sure u change server. Food took at least 1hr to come out. They even forgot my lemon thyme chicken when i order it about. They gave me a 25 dollar gift card for theier service. Worst experience ever!!
Azita A.,Los Angeles  CA,46,75,87,4/1/2017,1.0,"We asked for table for 2 ( Saturday 7:00 pm) and the hostess directed us to the waiting chairs "" there is no wait time for two"". We sat there witting and nobody called us. Then another party of two showed up and immediately were given a table!!! Not sure what to call this. Never will come again."
Jeff L.,Los Angeles  CA,16,4,,2/24/2017,1.0,"I\'m never eating here again and it really has nothing to do with the restaurant initially. Parking is horrible. My wife and I got take out and they have about 10 spaces for the people ordering take out. I waited 15 minutes and not one person came out with take out. Eventually my wife came out with the food and somebody came out with a 12 year old kid  no take out  and drove away from one of the spaces.... I told security about the problem and he said  ""well... we have a lot of restaurants using those spaces "" which insults my intelligence because what difference does it make. People are parking there and just eating and coming out  not as take out customers but as regular customers. To add to the madness that this place is  the food was cold and dry."
Taisha O.,Watts  Los Angeles  CA,7,5,1,4/15/2017,5.0,Julius was an amazing server!! He made our night tonight! His service was the best and I will be coming back.
Christina V.,Norwalk  CA,30,2,,4/22/2017,4.0,I love bj's! Our server Julius was super friendly and helpful. The fried artichoke was so good too
Brenan W.,Inglewood  CA,0,1,1,4/28/2017,5.0,We came in for my friends birthday  aside of the great waitress we had. Felix the night manager was soooo amazing and took care of our visit and the food and service was amazing man! Thanks BJs Culver City!! Keep up the great work Felix.....
Kerri H.,Torrance  CA,1467,619,2708,2/27/2015,4.0,I love BJs but this particular branch is always busy with a very long wait. The parking is not too easy to get to. But the service is friendly  just very packed.
Brian G.,Sun Valley  Los Angeles  CA,0,11,,5/12/2017,1.0,Been to lots of bj's and I was very disappointed with the service at thisLocation. The orders were wrong. Better service and quality from other locations. Spend the time and drive to another location.
Antonia J.,Woodland Hills  CA,2,4,,4/9/2017,5.0,Stevey's customer service was amazing. I can't wait to come back because of her. She knew the menu very well answered all the questions I had. She made sure to check on us at all times. I seen her moving nonstop and she kept a great attitude the whole time. It's rare I do Yelp reviews but she deserved it!
Jet'aime H.,Los Angeles  CA,23,3,,4/23/2017,4.0,My Experience Was Great Thanx To Julius  He Had Great Recommendations Very Skilled At The Art Of Customer Service. If You Want A Good Experience Be Sure To Ask For Julius & Ask What He Recommends
Tyreese B.,Los Angeles  CA,63,10,1,4/20/2017,5.0,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants where you can kick back and enjoy incredible flavors of food from an extensive ever evolving magazine style menu. The atmosphere is a sophisticated entertainment bar and grill without the pretense of feeling out of place. Anyone can feel at home in this aesthetically pleasing designed establishment. I recently visited the Culver City location with two friends  one in which who have never been to BJ's. We had a little miscommunication with our food order once it came out. My friend's order was not quite as expected but our gracious  exceptional server Natasha saved the day. She immediately asked the kitchen to correct the order. In the meantime  she gave my friend a hearty complimentary caesar salad until his meal came. On top of that  she also gave us dessert to make up for my friend's first experience at BJ's. With stellar  assiduous and amicable servers like Natasha  we will definitely come back to the Culver City location.
Michael J.,Carson  CA,137,8,1,3/11/2017,1.0,3-10-17 night shift. So I had all this time to write this review. This is me being nice. Imagine me cussing and throwing f bombs every sentence. Walked in on a Friday asking the hostess about happy hour (I know that there isn't any on fridays and Saturdays but doesn't hurt to ask) hostess says that there is happy hour today after 10pm (it's about 10) she told us to go find a seat at the bar for happy hour. Ok coolGot to an open seat waited for 20 mins to get it cleaned up. Waited another 20 mins to find out no happy hour. No biggie. Then waited for an hour for food. In the meanwhile  2 other groups came in about 20 mins after we got seated and got there food (pizza and other entrees) and left and paid  before we even received our food (a pizokie and sliders). Finished my water  and Once I got my food it took about another 20 mins to get a refill. The server was really busy and by herself.Can't blame the 1 server and busser. They are well understaffed. Blaming management. And the hostess (suppressed rage released) like it's the only job you have and you can't even get that right. How does the costumer know more than you. This is why minimum wage should be lower.
Anabell B.,Westchester / LAX  Los Angeles  CA,5,10,7,12/19/2016,1.0,Basically what other reviews have said. Service is not that good here. I would not recommend this place.
Tiffany L.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,2,4/16/2017,5.0,I called ahead within there 30 minute time frame for seating on a Friday night  table was ready for my party of 6 when I got there. Staff was friendly and quick. Great food! Deep dish ziti was awesome!
Thomas J.,Lakewood  CA,271,1,,4/15/2017,5.0,Julius was our server tonight. He was the best!!! He was on top of everything and was very quick and friendly. My experience tonight would definitely make me come back!
Bruce M.,Tarzana  Los Angeles  CA,169,1,,5/3/2017,1.0,I like other BJ locations  but at this one I ordered no aioli on my burger  got aioli with no cheese so I asked for the correct burger  and our waiter said they would make a new burger. It took so long to return  I figured they had made a new one. When t returned  it had a new bun  but there was still aioli on the mushroom where they had not wiped it all off. The waiter then tried to tell me it was new until I pointed out where there was aioli. I didn't even want another burger after that and went to the food court.
Reggie H.,Memphis  TN,93,9,32,9/24/2016,4.0,I had an amazing time at BJ's the deep dish pizza was awesome and wings was extra crispy just the way I love them! Only problem I had was a smell that was coming from beneath my table  it was like a sour stink. The waitress was nice but didn't know how to balance her customers   at times I waited for silverware after getting my food. Also my glass stayed dry due to her not constantly checking on me. I've been in the Restaurant/Club business for nearly 25 years  one thing I trained my employees is customer service to ensure repeat customer and great pay. Over all the atmosphere was amazing and people were friendly. #SayNoMore #FatmacEntertainment
Garrett B.,Firestone  CO,0,32,32,1/15/2017,5.0,We had a soccer team stop in here on a Saturday Night. Exhausted from the day and traveling from another state and with little options in the area for large groups  we called ahead and asked if they could seat 24 people. Tough sell on a playoff football night. Erica the manager took our number and said she would do her best to accommodate us by time got there. When we arrived  a line was out the door  but Erica told us it would be soon. 10 minutes  later  we had our seats all together in the corner. Awesome!Next  was Jaime  our poor waiter had to deal with tired and hungry teens.What a job he did! Fast  prompt service  going the extra miles on everything. Can't say enough. Superb!The food was great and worked for all.Thanks Erica and Jaime  please give these two some recognition!!!!
Rebecca M.,Marina del Rey  CA,0,5,,7/27/2016,4.0,Sometimes it's just one of those days!!We went in for a quick dinner after shopping tonight. We were seated quickly  and acknowledged by the server. Our server was covering about 20 tables by herself but was quick to bring us drinks and take our appetizer order. Our appetizer was inadvertently taken to the table next to us  and the people did not say anything  they just ate it. The waitress realized what happened  so she put in another order for us. The second one was undercooked. We did receive a hot appetizer and our meal. The manager was table side several times making sure we were happy  taking care of adjusting the bill. After some confusion it look like they got the server situation rectified. All three servers waiting on our area were pleasant and professional. Everyone had a smile. I want to thank the manager who was extremely kind  patient and willing to go above and beyond to make sure our experience was a good one  considering the problems with our food order tonight. I think the kitchen was just having an off night.The stars are for great customer service.
Mia T.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,0,3,1,9/17/2017,2.0,Save your time and money from this location. They are in a prime location within a busy mall and cannot keep up with the fast paced environment. We were seated very promptly but our server took it amongst herself to greet/serve other tables that were seated after us. We had to get the attention of a manager (who was very helpful) just to get something as basic as water. I've worked in hospitality so I understand it getting busy and not being able to immediately come to a table but if she had even acknowledged us to let us know that she was busy and would be with us in a moment then I wouldn't have been as upset. When she finally did approach us on the request of her manager  she had an attitude for being called out on her mistake and did not apologize..so that already shifted the entire mood of our meal. Long story short  we ended up packing up everything to go within 5 minutes of getting our food because the overall experience was that horrible. The manager was helpful but I don't accept apologies on behalf of somebody that won't even acknowledge that they're in the wrong. This location needs stronger servers who can keep up with their crowd.
Cynthia M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,4/16/2017,1.0,If i could give this place zero stars i would. I was there for 40 minutes at a table without a waiter/server to acknowledge us. My husband  daughter and I were very patient since we did realize they were very busy! The staff would not make eye contact with our table and people that arrived after us were being served their food. We did not receive a glass of water though we were there for 40 min. This has been the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Though my husband did notify the hostess twice that we hadn't been assisted yet we still felt completely ignored. We walked out. Do go to this location if you love terrible service.
Gustavo O.,Newbury Park  CA,29,9,,6/10/2016,4.0,I had a great experience with Charles last week. My girlfriend and I came in craving good burgers and wedge fries. She got the Chili Burg and I went with the Hickory Brisket. Her fries came out wrong but Charles fixed it right away. The Burgers were great and the wedge fries were everything I remembered (though they could have been warmer). After a small debate we said no to a pizookie but immediately regretted that decision as we made our way toward the door. As if he knew  Charles stopped us on our way out and presented us with a mini pizookie wrapped to go. Wow.Legendary Service!
Julie R.,Fresno  CA,0,3,,7/31/2017,2.0,Waitress seemed stressed. All fries we had with our meals were cold. Don't think I would recommend this BJ's
Dave H.,Truckee  CA,544,276,1290,1/9/2016,4.0,Food was good but drama was crazy. So.....the place is full  some sort of commotion occurs outside and spills inside. The dude is bloody and yelling at everone  challenging them to fight. Culver City's finest arrives and it's on. The dude is fighting and it takes 6 to take him into custody. Patrons run out on the bill  total chaos. Waiter was fast and excellent. Got us beers right away. I ordered the jambalaya and my son ordered a oizza. Excellent on both. We had the siracha baked Brussel sprouts. Iksy  I'm not a fan of Brussel spruots  but they made them taste really good. I'll be back again  for the food  but not tge drama
Bruce L.,Lawndale  CA,0,6,3,3/5/2017,1.0,BAD  BAD  BAD!!! These folk fail at every aspect of the restaurant business. FYI  doesn't look like they like to clean that much either. STAY AWAY!!!!
Daniel P.,Los Angeles  CA,523,2,,4/15/2017,5.0,Julius was extremely polite and very professional with our order and keeping the vibes positive! Deff 5 stars and hope to be served by him again when I come back!
Damian D.,Los Angeles  CA,61,17,14,4/2/2017,3.0,Ended up biting a bone while trying to eat my burger but the fries were okay and the customer service wasn't bad.
Rasool D.,Culver City  CA,131,1,,4/2/2017,5.0,I love this BJ's it has great service and great food and the location is perfect  the host we're nice and got me seated right away and my server was amazing if you go ask for Alex she is the best!!
Jennifer N.,Hawthorne  CA,165,291,123,11/18/2015,2.0,BJ's is known for pretty ok food with high calories and sodium where you can watch a game or 2. This place in particular I have been to at least 5x and without fail  the service is TERRIBLE. I can't necessarily blame the waiter as he always looked stressed but behind. I can't tell if this was his fault or not but if it isn't then they are too understaffed. He forgot my sisters salad entirely and my cousins burger came out ice cold. We knew the new one wouldn't come until we were totally ready to leave so he just bit the bullet and ate it cold. My hot sauce came after i was done with my Ziti which i would have bet money was going to happen. My Ziti had to have been sitting under a heat lamp because the noodles were hard on top and dried out. If it weren't for the location we would never keep coming back but we fall for it every time.
Harmony S.,Los Angeles  CA,11,1,,3/26/2017,2.0,The service was painfully slow and inattentive. The food was just okay  although I did like the spinach dip. Probably won't go back though.
Kevin G.,Warrenton  VA,1,9,3,8/24/2015,1.0,Very disappointing quality. I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it came with about half of the tuna that's shown in the menu pic. The roasted brussel sprouts were really good though.
Martin G.,Los Angeles  CA,2,11,3,12/7/2016,2.0,My family of four decided to have dinner @BJ after shopping at the mall. This was our second time eating at a BJ and after our experience  Now I remember why we rather eat at Olive Garden  sizzler  or island...First  it took about 15 min. for waitress to come to our table and take our drink order. After getting our drinks  we placed our order  which took close to 45-50 mins (and it wasn't busy). Between the initial drinks and the food coming to our table  we sat there with empty cups. Oh did I mention that when my son received his chicken boneless wings (nuggets) the waitress did not bring utensils nor napkins I had to ask for it. Shortly after the first plate my second son received his bacon burger  which he wasn't satisfied because it only had two strips of bacon (and he is only 13)  what would he know about food  oh did I mention that I asked again for utensil and napkins a second time and refills. So  my wife's salad and my pasta deep dish plate follow  and Yes we had to ask again for a third time for utensils and napkins! We thought it was just us  but we witness the same service with the two ladies sitting across from us  as they got there meals and sat there for about three minutes waiting for utensil as there food was getting cold. At the end of our dinner nothing wowed us about the meals we had  in fact we walked away wishing we would of being more satisfied going down the street to island or sizzler . As for the service  I think BJ could follow Olive Gardens  sizzler or Islands table service. Please understand that this review was base on our experience  but seems like others have had the same issues.
Brandie H.,Los Angeles  CA,1,16,,3/3/2017,1.0,I will never eat here again. Ordering Togo  paid for the meal and everything and the staff just couldn't get me my meal. I'm tired of going in there and the front house staff has horrible customer service. I hate bringing that type of energy into Yelp but it needs to be known that this Bj's has the worse customer service in Culver City.
Gwen R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,12/15/2016,1.0,Lousy! I ordered via labite and clearly the restaurant knows when it's a take out order. I ordered a steak medium well. It arrived heavily salted  too spicy and BURNT! It's my fault because tried this once before. Same result. Why wouldn't the restaurant want to have pride in every order? This is my first yelp review although I've had an account for years. Never again! Shame on you BJs!
Izzat A.,Arlington  VA,75,1312,12,6/20/2016,3.0,This location was slammed and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 3. Floors were pretty nasty and sticky. Service was just okay. Tried a pizookie for the first time and thought it was pretty good. Will keep on eating the pizzokie but prolly won't come back to this location. Not on a Friday night atleast.
Keisha W.,Compton  CA,33,2,,7/28/2017,4.0,Had a wonderful time. Awesome food! Had the: Root beer chicken wings  artichoke spinach dip  garden salad & Caesar salad  root beer ribs  parmesan chicken  chicken fettuccini Alfredo. Everything was wonderful. Thank you to Dario and Felix for making our visit special and memorable.
Erica T.,Carson  CA,0,1,,7/28/2017,1.0,This location is the absolute worst ... I went there with a friend of mine and we were seated... Once we were seated had to wait a good 10mins before the host acknowledged us... And he never gave his name just threw some glasses of water on the table ..... Then after that .... We ordered food and ask for the appetizer to come out before the entrees .... We waited about 15mins for that .... And it end up coming out 2 mins before the meal... Then afterwards the guy Jaime didn't check on our table much after that... And he brought out a dry ass baked potato with not butter or chives I had to ask for it.... Once we finish we paid for our bill... After I reached home I noticed I left a Old Navy bag there on the chair soI called back about a hour later and was placed on hold for 20 mins so I hang upAnd call back and the person over he phone says we have a lost and found but it's not there... So basically it seems like win that hour one of their associates stole my merchandise ..... Totally terrible experience
Stephen M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,14,12,3/16/2017,4.0,Had this amazing burger with fries and so did my girlfriend. She had got a root beer float and they gave her barely any root beer and ice cream. For $4.25 I expected more. Otherwise great to eat
Lucy D.,Los Angeles  CA,277,20,32,9/23/2016,2.0,"This BJ\'s used to be so good a couple of years ago. It used to be one of my boyfriend\'s and my ""go to"" places to eat when we just could not decide where to go to dinner. The past several times I have eaten there the service has been down right lousey. On our most recent visit - the restuarant was not super crowded - we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to just and come take our drink orders. I hate when that happens and it sours the rest of dining experience. We ended up walking out and going to eat somewhere else. The few times before service was lacking as well in various ways; empty drinks with no server in sight for a refill and waiting too long for our check. Unfortunately they have also recently raised the prices of some of our favorite menu items - the steak. This BJ\'s has been crossed of our list after too many second chances."
D R.,Upland  CA,0,16,,7/7/2017,5.0,Went for lunch  Julius  our waiter  got us in and out quickly. He made our experience very pleasant; was always a step ahead of us: refilling drinks before we asked and suggesting substitutes.
Rayvin D.,Long Beach  CA,0,2,,10/8/2017,1.0,Worst BJS if I could give 0stars I would! Our waitress had an attitude when she came to our table first off. She was dark skinned with a short haircut. She gave me an attitude when I asked her where the bathroom was! Then after she ordered our food it took forever to come. I have never waited that long for my food at bjs. Then when our food came she set it down and walked off quick so we couldn't even ask for anything. Then she furniture to bring the sauces we asked for so we had to wait 10 minutes to flag her down and ask about our 2 barbeque sauces and 1 ranch. We waited another 10 minutes she still never brought them then we asked another lady and she just walked to the front she didn't even bother to go to the back and get it. Then we asked a guy and said our waitress will bring them. Finally after waiting for who knows how long she finally brought our sauce but she brought 2 ranch and 1 bbq and we tried to flag her down so we had to ask a guy and he had to go get our waitress for us and she finally came and brought us our correct sauces quickly. Then my friend but her burger and it was very rare!!! And I had a piece of wood from what looked like a toothpick in my burger but our burgers didn't come with toothpicks! At this point I was beyond upset and was ready to get the check so of course we had to wait for 15 minutes just to get our waitress to come to our table and while waiting we realized the people next to us got up and left because the customer service was so bad. When she finally brought the check she has an extra sandwich on our meal so we had to wait for her to come back to correct it and of course she had an attitude so we had to wait for her to comeback to bring the new receipt then we had to wait again for her to come back so we could pay. And the worst thing is that this was my birthday dinner so I didn't even get a pazookie because I was so upset and did not have the patience to sit and wait there another 30 minutes to an hour. I did not give her a tip and will never go back to that bjs.
Alicia O.,Lynwood  CA,212,216,187,10/31/2016,4.0,Went here a lot when I worked down the street. Bar staff was always friendly and quick with the service. Their small eats menu was perfect for the 'I want to avoid rush hour traffic' time.
Haley K.,San Jose  CA,496,405,707,11/22/2015,2.0,I'm not sure if all the bjs are going downhill or if it's just the ones I've been to lately  but this is the second one in a row that's had the same issue.My friend and I got there on Saturday around 130pm. It was pretty busy  but we were seated right away. There were two large parties of 20+ people but luckily they had already been served or were being served so I figured service wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong. We were seated for 10 minutes before anyone came by to introduce themselves and take our drink order. By this time we had already decided what to get. My friend got the mini pizza and salad lunch special and I decided to get the small pizza to have some leftover for lunch the next day. The waitress repeated our order and most was incorrect so we re corrected her. We were hopeful she would get the order right when placing it. Nope  we were wrong.It took about 30 minutes once we placed the order for our food to come out (my friends salad came first). Once the food came out we realized the pizza were the same size  a mini. I ordered a small. I didn't mind it was a mini but I would have ordered the lunch special if that was the case (it was $4 cheaper and came with a salad). We explained and the waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to wait for the small. No I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. They were nice and ended up giving us $5 off  but service overall was terrible. We didn't see our waitress half the time  the bathrooms were dirty and only 2 stalls had toilet paper. Basically  I won't be coming back to this location.
Leah A.,Jacksonville  FL,735,1051,9096,12/10/2015,2.0,Yes  I know. BJ's is your typical chain restaurant that serves up American favorites  including deep dish pizzas  salads  sandwiches  pastas  steaks  baby back ribs and a gazillion other things on their menu. Plus  you can have beer--lots of it. Yay. They are not mind-blowing.Honestly  it's a good place to go for BJ's Famous Pizookie. I like the original chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream  but it's hardly enough for me to share. I definitely think they've shrunk over the years. But what can you do?Overall  it's an OK place for a little appetizers with the group to share and drink some beers on tap. I usually get a flight  but again they are run-of-the-mill beers nothing too impressive. Probably won't frequent this chain restaurant except for every once in a blue moon. Oh well.
Veronica M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,7/8/2017,1.0,I haven't been to BJ's in a while and wanted to try out my local one  but I should of gone somewhere else. The service was horrible!!! The food was not hot  but luke warm. Even the beer was room temperature. Our appetizer plates never got picked up. Our server never introduced herself and I left feeling unhappy!!! Don't waste your time at this location. You get better service at chick fil-a. To top it off they gave us the wrong bill.
Desiree C.,Long Beach  CA,179,11,,7/10/2016,1.0,By far the WORST BJ's I've ever been to. Let me start off with the wait time to have a waitress come and assist us. Took about 15-20 mins for our waiter to actually come to our table (we didn't complain). We were never given utensils until 10 minutes after our food was served. Like seriously utensils should be at the table before our food. The Strawberry Lemonade I ordered was merky and foamy and looked more like a michelada then any strawberry Lemonade I've ever had. Gross. I was hoping the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne would make up for it all and boy was I wrong. It was cold and dry  had almost no sauce. Let me mention all the tables around me were complaining about the service  food  and the fact that they too had no utensils with their food. I love Bj's. One of my favorite restaurants  but this was by far the worst Bj's ever. Don't come here.
Beatrice J.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,2,2/22/2016,2.0,Well...went to bjs tonight for my granddaughters bithday.The food was good  actually I had the Quinoa SaladAnd it was fantastic..But the svc was the poorest svc I have ever experienced...I asked for two checks and it didn't come that way.. she never took the dirty plates off the table.We would ask for something and it took forever to get it..she literally said I forgot.....Rediculous.....just the lousietSVC I have ever experienced
Johnay P.,Los Angeles  CA,82,2,9,7/6/2016,3.0,Yesterday my friend and I cane directly from the airport craving their delicious soup in a bread bowl  and we encountered the worst service ever. Ashler waited our table and to my surprise she was   snappy  rude  and inattentive. We had to flag her down every time we needed service. Our drinks were refillable  yet we were offered no refills  our desserts were served on a cluttered table along with the desserts being served cold  while promised on the menu to be hot. My standard's are to be polite  and tip  and it was difficult to do either one. This location always has terrible servicers who seem to tired to smile and be courteous.
Josie M.,Los Angeles  CA,143,160,379,3/10/2016,4.0,"There have been plenty of visits I\'ve made here with friends and close ones. Not all my visits have been excellent and because of that I give them 4 stars. This review is my overall experience adding up last nights  and my past visits to this BJ\'s. My boyfriend and I usually come in around night time due to our busy work schedules  and the restaurant is always busy. The wait isn\'t very long at all  0-10 minutes the most to get a seat (except weekends it\'s a bit more busy than week days. The service is 4 out 5 times EXCELLENT! Waiters ask us if we need refills  and get us our orders correct 100% of the time! I usually start of with a chicken tortilla soup which they bring out fresh and serve in front of you. Then we get our deepdish pizza with no tomato chunks on top (normally they put tomato pieces on top of the deep dish)  and a side order of thin cut fries and/or mozzarella sticks. Afterwards our waiter comes back and we order a pizookie. Now  the pizookies come in two different size options: 1= a ""regular sized pizookie"" which is about 6"" I believe  or 2= a ""Pizooke Trio""  in which you get to choose 3 tiny different-flavored pizookies of your choice. Full tummies call for a regular sized pizookie (for 2 people to share) and you can ask for half and half flavors! My favorite is their Oreo flavor and my bf likes their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  which means it\'s a win/win for us! Prices are reasonable  and there is a parking area located right outside  or you can park in the mall and walk all the way to it!"
Andre W.,Inglewood  CA,0,12,4,8/7/2016,1.0,"I have been to BJ\'s many times and I love their foot. The entire menu is great tasting food. Mouth watering and delicious. I took one of my girlfriends for dinner the other night. And  to start off  the waitress was I guess having a bad shift. Well anyway  we ordered our food at around 7:30. Our drinks came right away so we enjoyed or drinks. I look at my watch and it\'s now 8:05 and our food is not ready. I ask the waitress  "" How much longer will it take for our food "". Her reply was  "" Let me go see ""! With an attitude! She came back about 10 minutes later and informs me that the chef is very busy creating and gaining his food making motivation. All and all  our food arrives for our eating to finally begin. The time was 8:55! One hour and 25 minutes after we ordered! This damn food was all screwed up! My ladies food was well past done and my food was burnt to a total crisp! My food looked like a plate of charcoal was placed on it! I immediately summoned the manager to discuss this MF foolishness! The manager walks over to our table and I display my displeasure in this terrible service and the food!He tells me that he is sorry for what happened and informed me that I could have two free meals of any cost the next two visits. I can really care less about free food so  I refused that offer. I just wanted an explanation why the waitress was horrible and why the chef took so long cooking our food. The manager explained that the chef is the best that they have and he cooks on his emotional contacts. Chef J always flirts with female customers and frequently while cooking  he will take one female customer in the back and have sex with her while cooking. That\'s his emotional contact that helps him cook and create. The waitress is his girlfriend and she get jealous mad and upset at what he does! I was totally and completely flabbergasted at what I just heard! I was at a total loss of words and completely puzzled. I have a difficult time seeing a chef cooking and boning while at work in the kitchen. Very crazy to think about!"
George V.,Alhambra  CA,0,69,73,6/22/2016,5.0,I come here when I've had a rough week. Ariel is an above a well average server. I love it when the server provides side notes on their food items  which is extremely rare and Ariel did this when I exposed my deer in headlight look. Great lunch specials and awesome TV space.They offer two types of fries!
Bronwen E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,6,2/1/2017,2.0,We came for a birthday dinner. My first time here  had heard they had good food. Everyone was nice and we got seated right away  The waiter took so long to come by we were able to order drinks and our dinner. I like it when you can get a drink in before dinner. We both had a steak and my toddler son had a corn dog. The food was OK. I am not a good cook and even I could have made that steak. With the service being so slow the food being average and the parking SUCKS I will not be back.
Gabie L.,Los Angeles  CA,32,75,257,12/16/2015,1.0,My husband and I went there around 8:30ish. Not much busy so we got a table right away. We ordered avocado egg rolls  pizza  and portobello burger. I thought the portobello burger is a vegetarian menu so I got a bite without any doubt when the food came. There was a meat patty in it.. I should ask a server whether the portobello burger is a vegetarian option or not....... Why didn't our server asked me though. Anyway  our server gave plates for us but she put cash (guess that's her tips from other customers so she put them on the plate) on the plate and took them back once she gave the plates us. cash is pretty dirty and that shouldn't be on the plate. I will definitely not come back here even if I'm super hungry. Anyway  our server is pretty fast and seems professional.
A G.,Norwalk  CT,0,2,1,6/30/2017,1.0,Service is horrible  our waitress just ignore us the entire time ask several time fir water just keep ignoring us
Mr And Mrs V.,Orange County  CA,1,36,39,11/17/2016,3.0,Love BJ's but today was disappointing. We ordered the calamari and it wasn't as tasty as other times. The Blood Orange Pom Sangria tasted like fireball. Service from Jose was great though.
Chris G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,49,13,7/10/2016,3.0,Drinks were quick  no waiting... Don't order the chips and guacamole. More chips than guac to spread. What I'm suppose to do with extra chips that are left? Boneless wings were great! Club sandwich was good. Portions are ok. Probably wouldn't waste my time or money coming back.
Erik H.,San Francisco  CA,10,32,,11/22/2016,1.0,Seated during a not busy time  server took 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. Ordered  informed waitress of a few things to be left off my order due to allergy. Drinks took another 15 minutes for water and one glass of wine. Opened napkin  silverware inside was dirty. Had to get replacement myself  waitress no where to be seen.Food arrived  things requested to be left off were there  one of the items I didn't discover until I bit into it. Spit it out  but damage was done  started swelling. They replaced my burger with a mostly raw  still wrong order. At least the fries were OK. Bill came  they tried to charge me for two burgers. Had to run and find medicine to not have to go to ER/die. Will never eat here or at any BJ's ever again.
A P.,Los Angeles  CA,3,34,14,5/24/2015,1.0,"Not  nope  never  noooooooo way will I ever return! UGHHHH & EWWWW!I\'ve now tried BJ\'s a handful of times. I would describe my experience with this large chain restaurant as very mixed. I would rate all of these experiences from horrible to just meh... the food filled up the void.This last visit was the ""hair"" that broke the camel\'s back!Let\'s start with the overall quality of the food:Mediocre at best.The food is fairly bland and unremarkable.Regarding how well the food is prepared:Poor. On one occasion  I ordered salmon. It didn\'t just come out blackened  it came out burnt. As well  the sauce was missing. The so-called roasted asparagus turned into something resembling  inedible  fibrous hay. The rice pilaf was a tasteless pile. Temperature of all of the food was lukewarm to cold. I had to send every single thing back to the kitchen and pray no one hocked up a loogie on what replaced it. The replacement meal was a slight improvement and they gave me a free pizookie dessert. The pizookie was the best part of the whole meal. Oy!Most of the other meals I had here were of similar caliber.Service: I know others have complained about service  but I\'ve always received adequate to excellent service.Ambience:Extremely noisy! Very loud chatter accompanied by multiple TVs displaying sports events.Now  for my most recent visit  the one that finally pushed me over the edge:I ordered a mozzarella and tomato salad and actually  I was quite surprised at how good it tasted. It was well spiced and the portion was generous. The textures were also interesting  a slight crunch accompanied the softness of the mozzarella and fresh tomatoes. The dish was finished with a visually interesting pattern of balsamic vinegar sauce.Then IT appeared! Just as I was about to enjoy the nearly last mouthful of tiny  cute  round  plump mozzarella balls  I spotted IT! YIKES GADZOOKS  OH MYYYY. There was a curly HAIR resting ever so gently on my mozzarella ball! Oy! Sheeeesh. Gives new meaning to the word hairball!I called the manager over and the hair convo went something like this:Disgusted diner: ""Hi  do you know that the human hair is one of the dirtiest things on the planet? The guys in the back wear hair nets?""Manager: ""Yes  we follow all health department rules and regulations.""Disgusted diner: ""Well  I guess one  little hair just snuck out!""Manager: ""Oh  I\'m so sorry that happened to you  would you like another one?""Disgusted diner: ""No  I don\'t want another HAIR!""Manager: ""Is there something else I can get for you?""Disgusted diner: ""No thank you.""Then  the manager patted my back in a very awkward  creepy fashion I found totally creepy and awkward.Disgusted diner: ""I think you should comp my meal.""Manager: ""Hmmmm.""Then  he walked away.The sweet server returned and said she would speak to him. She did  and he comped the meal.I made sure to tip her anyway  but she was surprised. Wasn\'t her fault. She deserves to work in a better restaurant. I hope her tips are never lacking or reduced due to poor food.After this debacle  I did choke down some of the mediocre main course  but my appetite hadn\'t recovered.King Tux  my BFF foodie review partner was very dismayed he didn\'t get to sample anything. Now  he\'s really  really pissed at me. Poor guy just didn\'t understand!"
Alex C.,Los Angeles  CA,128,15,8,11/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"First the hostess pretty much pointed her finger and said sit ""anywhere over there somewhere"". I asked her to please direct me and a friend of mine to a booth. She took us to a booth that was still dirty from the people before us. We sat down and it took a bus boy about 6 minutes to finally get there and take the plates and fake wipe the table with a dirty ass dish rag that stunk the whole space up till we left. I can keep going but long story short  fuck this place. Never going back."
Bridgett L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,6/15/2017,1.0,If I could give this location 0 stars I would. This place is horrible. Forget that the food always comes out cold or COMPLETELY wrong  the staff is rude  unprofessional  and a huge disappointment. Do not come here.
Susan N.,Los Angeles  CA,72,106,25,8/27/2016,3.0,I came in to celebrate my birthday with my bestie. We were there around 2:30 p.m. and Tiffany was our waitress. However  the hostess needs her attitude rechecked as she got extremely unhinged when we asked to sit at another location. Her rudeness towards us was duly noted. We sat a good 10 or so minutes with no acknowledgement from anyc wait staff. My friend even waved her hands to get ANYBODY'S attention. Her not letting our waitress know was not cool.
Sandi T.,Inglewood  CA,143,36,6,9/12/2016,1.0,Disgusting!! I ordered potato skins to go and when I got home to eat them the potato skins were not fully cooked...I threw them away and called the manager...she wanted me to bring them back that night which I wasn't doing since I lived miles away. I told her that I won't be in the area till the following Thursday and she said bring them then ummmmm no I'm not keeping that trash till then I just hung up. This past weekend I gave them another try I ordered a vegetarian pizza and it was so nasty the dough didn't taste fully cooked...I won't go into the details but I WILL NEVER GO TO ANOTHER BJ
Sarina F.,Los Angeles  CA,89,98,48,2/3/2017,4.0,My family and I chose to dine here last night. I have always had an up or down experience at BJ's. Tonight was great. I think our server's name was Jake. He was very attentive to us during our entire meal. He even came back after dropping the check to see if we needed anything else  and this is a rarity. We felt like we could take our time and enjoy everything. For appetizers we ordered the wings with lemon pepper dry rub and the brussel sprouts. I was worried the sprouts might be to spicy  however they were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of sauce. The wings were a little salty for me. I would skip them next time and order a different starter. My kids had the skinny fries to start. They arrived hot and crisp. The kids loved them. For dinner my boyfriend and I shared the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs and the Great White Pizza. The Spaghetti and Meatballs was my favorite part. The portion was large and the meatballs tasted very fresh. We requested more of the garlic knots to accompany the pasta. The pizza had garlic on it  which gave an amazing flavor to it along with the white sauce on the pizza. Can't go wrong with deep dish.
C. F.,Hawthorne  CA,0,1,,5/21/2017,4.0,I've visited this particular BJ a number of times. All of the waiters/waitress have been good. But the last time I came Julius provided such great memorable service. He was very attentive and jovial  not to just me and my guest but everyone he was heloi
Raina S.,Inglewood  CA,0,1,,6/8/2017,4.0,I came in to this location yesterday around noon and it was packed to capacity! My guess is because of graduation plus the normal lunch rush. I have to say though the hostess at the front... I believe her name was Ashley! She was really friendly and moving nonstop but she made sure to get me and my family seated in a timely manner and she did it with a smile despite I'm sure she was stressed. She was the only one I noticed at the front so I'm sure she was by herself. She makes me want to come back! My server was also very attentive. Definitely coming back!
Tom H.,Torrance  CA,51,396,8,3/14/2016,4.0,First time at this location but we've been to quite a few other BJ's locations in the southland. Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 14  and we're seated under an hour which isn't too bad when you think about it. I do want to give a shout out to our server  for a large party he did an excellent job. We even requested to split the check four separate ways and he pulled it off without a hitch. In terms of the food  everything came fine and I don't think we've ever had a problem with food quality at any BJ's.
Sarah R.,Los Angeles  CA,423,657,655,3/25/2015,4.0,I love BJ's.. the food is delicious. Everything I've ordered so far has been good. I love their steaks  French dip and club sandwiches  so good! You kind of have to get a pizookie when you come.. it's a big cookie with ice cream on top. I love it and I'm not even usually into sweets. They also have some delicious strawberry topped beignets that are to die for.This location gets very busy and it can sometimes take forever for you to get your food  but the food is worth it. It's not the most inexpensive option at the mall  but it's a good place to go and unwind after a shopping trip or even on its own.
Vanessa V.,Montclair  CA,7,3,1,5/13/2017,5.0,My mother and I came here today and Julius was our waiter. From the very beginning he was kind and made us feel very welcomed  super quick and attentive. Definitely giving all 5 stars to him! The food and pizookies were also great as well.
Pamela C.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,52,2,,5/30/2017,5.0,I am a BJ's regular  I normally get the same thing (jambalaya and a strawberry lemonade). But today I dared to be different at the suggestion of a server! Her name is Emilie and she was friendly  helpful  and knowledgeable about her menu. I ordered a watermelon margarita and a Parmesan chicken and loved every bite and sip of it! I will definitely be returning soon!
Christopher C.,Costa Mesa  CA,174,74,301,8/26/2016,5.0,You get five stars for one over all solidified reason... Larry the bar tender   food was good but larry is a cool dude   recomended great beers and over all always tends to me and my fellow co worker when we go for our weekely lunch. Larry is fracking cowabunga!!
August A.,Los Angeles  CA,234,19,18,4/10/2016,4.0,Just your normal run of the mill BJ's. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Salads to die for. Our waiter was pretty awesome too. Don't like crying babies? Then don't come here. They lose a star because I had to wait 15 minutes before getting seated  when many tables were open. I don't like wasting my time
Alexis K.,Santa Monica  CA,122,103,14,2/20/2016,2.0,"How can a place that is so nasty be so packed!?! I guess when you\'re hungry and stuck at the mall you get desperate. You see the pictures of the food on the menu and think  ""That looks good  that looks hard to screw up."" Think again. This place is just sketchy. My drink was gnarrrrrllly. My salad was rancid and looked nothing like the picture! Don\'t put a picture if you aren\'t going to deliver what\'s in the picture. The guy next to me ordered a well done hamburger and it came completely pink inside. We ordered a soup to start and it never came. The service is slow and unimpressive. It\'s a chain  so I guess they are more about quantity than quality. The chicken tenders were ok I guess  but you could do better at Wing Stop."
Mark M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,11/6/2016,2.0,Food was good  however the service is seriously lacking. Not sure if it's because they're short staffed or what  but our drinks weren't refilled 1 time. The food didn't come to us the way we ordered it. This place needs better staff or more of them. Either way I don't recommend coming here.
Maria G.,Los Angeles  CA,3,2,,11/17/2016,5.0,The food here was good ..I ordered the spinach dip which I love and our server was very attentive ..and always came up to check up on us..I'll say I had good service in this place..will be coming back.
Liz L.,Brownsville  TX,0,4,,5/6/2017,4.0,The salmon & were great! John was a good waiter. He was attentive. I could have given 5 stars but at the end it did take him awhile to give us our tea.
Rasheena G.,Los Angeles  CA,131,7,,10/16/2016,3.0,The food at BJ's is delicious. The service at this location is subpar. Our appetizer came out after half of our main course was eaten and when our check came out  our waitress never came to pick it up. After about 10 minutes of waiting  I walked it up to the front receptionist to have someone else ring me up. Maybe it's because it was a Saturday night  but I was unimpressed.
Alexander F.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,33,6,2,1/22/2016,5.0,Come on a Friday night and let me tell you the service was great Contessa and Derek were on top of there game as soon as we were sat they were very attentive and they really took care of us. I've been to a few BJs and this experience was by far the best. Thanks again Derek and Contessa you guys made my dining experience excellent 5 stars!!
Shauna N.,Hawthorne  CA,66,207,238,11/24/2015,2.0,My family grew up going to the BJ's in Westwood and were so excited when they built one closer to our house. I am sad to say the quality and the service is nothing like the one in other locations. The atmosphere has always been chaotic. The waiters don't write things down and then mess up your order. I had to ask the waiter what happened to my salad as he was bringing out my meal. The waiters never check back to see if they were right or if everything tastes ok. I have given this location 5 tries because I want it to just be one waiters fault but sadly it has been every waiter I have ever had there. The staff is friendly you just won't get what you asked for. If you are able to catch another waiter walking by and ask them to get your waiter they look at you like you are crazy. The food is good it just sadly may take several hours and come out cold or just not at all what you asked for.
Krystal B.,Los Angeles  CA,3,26,5,9/15/2016,1.0,This place obviously needs RESTAFFING! The manager Caleb was VERY CONDESCENDING when I asked for barbecue sauce! Please get out of customer service if you are going to be rude when customers make a simple request. Regardless of what you are going through on any given occasion when you walk on stage (I.e.  the work place) slap a smile on your face. This place already has 2.5 stars before I left this rating and you would think they would take a hint and STEP IT UP! This is awful. Go to Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory for a better experience.
Lakashia N.,Los Angeles  CA,15,66,64,8/2/2016,2.0,Our waitress provided great customer service it was a party of 6. I ordered traditional bone in wings with drizzle hot sauce and ranch. As soon as our waitress bought out our food I did noticed that my wings were old and room temperature I did bring it to waitress attention and then notified the manager. The manager was awesome and very understanding she provided me with a free pooskie on the house.
Tae G.,Carson  CA,98,744,1880,12/27/2015,3.0,This BJ's is the 'hangout' spot for many. Wait and parking can be a hassle  but service is good. I like the soups in the bread loaf  salads  and spinach & artichoke dip the most. You can't beat a pizookie of any flavor. Today  our waitress  Taj  was excellent! She was friendly  quick  and attentive. She knows the menu well and was on point. Kudos to you  Taj!
Tiffany R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,4/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Friday April 7 we decided to try this establishment once more.the food was fine  until my daughter took her last nite of her hickory brisket bacon burger  she pulled out a piece of gray hair 2 to 3 inches long after it was in her mouth. I'm bald the wife doesn't have any gray hair and my 2 teenage daughters sure don't. We pointedthis out to the waitress who apologized and kindly ask if the daughter wanted another one  we agreed and took it home . Thought everything was fine until the daughter decided to eat the burger Saturday afternoon what did she discover but another gray hair the same as the first  someone preparing foodat BJ's has a problem.
Cedric C.,Hawthorne  CA,0,2,,10/21/2016,5.0,Been here a few times and I can say this is by far the best service I have gotten Cystial M was amazing and her recommendation on food was honest and true will come back just for her service again thank you Cystial
Cathie M.,Culver City  CA,0,2,,10/20/2016,3.0,Normally love this place but tonight I was terribly disappointed  I made a reservation for a party of 12 to celebrate my granddaughters 18th birthday. When we arrived we were told that we would have to wait 20-25 minutes when I asked what the point of a reservation was I was told they had other large parties at the same time and we would just have to wait. When we were finally seated around 7:30 we were seated next ro another party that was so loud we couldn't hear each other speak the manager said that there was nothing he could do. I don't think that this experience will stop me from eating hear however I will no longer have a large party.Have to addThat our server Jake was really Fantastic  he was very apologetic and we understood that their was really nothing that could be done. I even got up at one point and asked politely for the group to tone it down to no avail. In the end management did discount our bill and compd dessert . But one of my guests had to suggest this to the manager . Again the wait staff has always Been great and Jake helped to turn the situation around.
Lanisha C.,Winnetka  Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,3/19/2017,1.0,"I try not to complain but this is the worse BJs ever. After various issues dining in  my husband & I decided to give takeout a try. We attempted to do the ""curb side"" option but after calling several times and never reaching anyone my husband found a parking spot (parking for this area is an entirely different issue) and ran in. After being inside for 10 minutes  he came out to tell me that his meal was ready but mine was not. I was surprised because I ordered a simple salad. Nevertheless he returned  meals in hand about 20 minutes later. Eat here at your own risk!"
Serena D.,Culver City  CA,181,3,,10/1/2016,5.0,"I eat here almost every day because I work in the mall and love being able to order my food and walk right in to get it. My experience here with both the managers and the staff at the take out area is typically amazing. They give excellent service. The one thing they can work on as an overall location is their communication with customers. Sometimes the person working the take out area has to step away to get an order or something else  which I understand. On numerous occasions I\'ve walked up to an empty desk and not been contacted until that worker gets back. It does not hurt the 2-4 people standing around the host desk or passing by to say ""hey just give them a second they\'ll be right with you"". Stop ignoring your customers  contact them. Doesn\'t seem like the take out area has support from other areas in the store which seems unfair."
Amber C.,Los Angeles  CA,26,7,4,2/22/2016,5.0,Out of my dessert but the manager asked if there's anything they could do to compensate. Clean  great music  hot bartender. Pretty good food. I ordered the quinoa salmon bowl. It was really good but was heavy on the asparagus pieces  with only 2 tips. Strong beer. 95 of 100. Would eat here again.
lori l.,Tarzana  CA,0,8,,7/12/2016,1.0,BJ's Restaurant in Fox Hills Mall is disgusting! Plates were dirty  waiters serve food with their fingers in the dish  we found plastic film immersed in our glass of water...Avocado was brown and service is horrible. Hostess is rude and lazy! The true definition of irony is....all this was happening while the health inspector was in the kitchen with the manager!BEWARE....DANGER....STAY AWAY!
Brandee T.,Inglewood  CA,0,5,2,1/13/2016,5.0,Such a great experience today! The staff was friendly and prompt. I tried the new root beer glazed wings and omg they were amazing! They had a sweet root beer smell and taste! I would definitely recommend a visit to BJ's in culver city for a quick lunch break or happy hour go-to! Great menu choices  great staff  great music and great location! Thanks Eugene and your awesome staff!!
Jolienne A.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,4/11/2017,4.0,I had a great experience overall. My server named Edgar was very polite and attentive. The chicken alfredo was good for the most part but a little dry. Definitely coming back
Denise S.,Los Angeles  CA,1,9,40,10/20/2014,1.0,"There lunch items go 4 $6.95  not $5.95; thats  2 lure u in. Plus the food is not good; not at this location. The one in El Monte is soooooo much better. Good service & good food. At this 1 they need 2 FIRE the alleged ""cook"" & the slow wsutresses  especially the unprofessional one working up ftont. She\'s ridiculous  lil midget.I recommend the Yard house n the Marina; Excellent!"
Mariecar M.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,16,105,52,10/27/2014,1.0,I hadn't been in a while and I found out why: the kids they have serving don't know about beer. The food is what you'd expect at a chain like this though  which is to say that it's your standard American fare with wannabe ethic fusion dishes. And just when you think you can order a salad without them messing it up  they bring a Caesar salad that was overdressed and wilted like it had been tossed earlier in the day and put in the fridge.What I did like we're the fried artichoke hearts and the bison burger (surprisingly tasty thanks to the smokey chipotle sauce) the pizookie  of course. But next time at the mall  I'd rather eat at Hot Dog on a Stick.
Alexandria L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,6/21/2017,2.0,My original waiter Jamie was great he came approached the table told us about specials and took or order brought my sons food out first which was perfect. He then stated that he would be going on his lunch break informed the other waitress that would be taking over for him but she was busy with other table so we finished our food 10 mins later and she still hadn't come to greet us 30 mins go by and still nothing she was in the kitchen or walking around not addressing us or introducing herself or asking if we needed anything by this time I'm ready to go so I find a manager and inform him of what has happened then she came running to me to get me to stop telling her manager that we were being ignored she came blamed our previous waiter for her to coming to our table and then disappeared I'm now waiting to put my bill another 20 mins go by so I ask for the manager informed him that I have work early in the morning and I'm ready to go he went to go adjust my check in my opinion should have been free since she made us wait for so long or previous waiter is now coming back from his break and asked how everything was and he apologized. Management said he would speak with her I hope he really does speak with her I will not be returning to this location EVER!!!!!!
Gigi H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,9/3/2016,1.0,I really like the food here  but the service SUCKS!!! There is no reason why I should be seated  then 10-12 min later have to go back to the hostess to ask who my waiter is. This has happened on more than one occasion  and I keep telling myself don't go back  but I do. This is the LAST time I will EVER come back!!!
K P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,1,3/4/2016,3.0,Had the EnLightened omelet... Very tasty! Its loaded with tender delicious veggies and came with fresh fruit.Only con was the temperature on some items. I ordered potatoes and sent them back cuz the were not hot enough...same with the coffee. Otherwise  it was a nice meal.
Jatinder K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,9/27/2016,2.0,Food is great but the service is horrible. We are given wet plates with old food particles still on there. And when we ask the waiter for different plates they give us attitude. Second if you order appetizers and entrees they bring out everything all at once. The meaning of appetizers is to snack a little before our main course comes. If the main course comes same time as he appetizers then the appetizers are pointless.
Chuck D.,Los Angeles  CA,641,1157,8323,7/23/2013,3.0,"Went here on a Friday night to meet some friends visiting from out of the country & one that is an airline pilot that was arriving at LAX that night. Hence the reason for meeting in the Westside. I agree with other Yelpers in that this place is ""parking challenged"". I drove by and didnt see any spaces near the front of the restaurant available & it didn\'t look like they would open up anytime soon. There is valet right at the Fox Hills mall entrance closest to BJ\'s. I drove around back near the pizzeria & other eateries and fortunately found a space at the very corner.We started off at the bar with our fluctuating group headcount... for some drinks & some appetizers (calamari). Calamari was good & plentiful for an appetizer portion but what was with the ranch dipping sauce beside the requisite marinara?? Not necessary IMO. We closed the bar tab & finally got a table after what seemed like over an hour long wait. We arrived at 9pm. We probably were seated around 1045pm? In all fairness  we did not request a table or have the needed headcount til about 930-940  but still... we waited a while. It was friday night  i know. It was busy but not wall to wall packed by any means.I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. I opted for the wedge cut fries... The food arrived in a decent amount of time. It was good. The bread wwas delish. It had a bit of a crispness on the outside & was soft on the inside. Just perfect... I like the garlic aioli that was spread on the bread. The burger patty itself was good  a little dry but I ordered it well so that\'s what I get. The cheddar cheese was good. I needed ketchup for my fries & the waiter was quick to get that. I asked for a refill on water & that took a long time. I was really thirsty by the time I had to remind him about it... That was a bummer.Decent food. Inconsistent service but a good place to have drinks & a meal with friends. Good luck finding parking. Bring patience."
Sandy L.,Los Angeles  CA,147,158,337,9/21/2014,4.0,BJ's is a good chain sports restaurant. I recommend skipping the line so sit in the bar and enjoy one of many sports games that are on. Hint for the single ladies: There are a lot of guys in the bar area so if you are looking to meet someone  there is a great male to female ratio. May the odds be evah in your favor.Food is good - There is also a ton of beers on tap options.If you go with a vegan or vegetarian you can make any burger on the menu a veggie burger. Service is good as well.
Chris F.,Cerritos  CA,0,4,,3/20/2017,1.0,"Yelp really needs a negative star rating! What a joke of a restaurant. The only thing more aggravating than the rude hostesses and inattentive waitstaff is that glorified saltine they call a pizza. I wouldn\'t even throw hot-sauce on the damn thing for fear my taste buds would associate that taste with hot sauce in the future. Who knew complaining to the tatted-up restaurant manager about the do-nothing hostess would result in lip service to the tune of  ""We apologize and I will have a discussion with her"" and pizza that tasted like that? Then again maybe that\'s why it tasted like that! I hope I never find myself west of the 110 and spending money at places like this ever again."
robin s.,Culver City  CA,18,78,38,7/16/2016,5.0,As overworked as our server was and the kitchen was backed up  Makita shined like a star
Nick C.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,12,,12/10/2015,1.0,I went to this location back on 11/3/2015 for my son's birthday. I was looking forward to celebrating his birthday but our waiter Eric  I believe that was his name  made that impossible.We proceeded to receive the worst service from a waiter I think ever  well it could be worse like pissing in your food or violence right? But no really  like he took 30 minutes to take our drink order  and probably waited another 20 minutes for our drinks  then we ordered our food  which by the way TOOK FOREVER to be delivered and when it got to us it was COLD COLD COLD. Gross!Sadly our waiter Eric  never came to ask us if we were good or if the food was good or if we needed drink refills or anything like that. He forgot our dinner items as well.When it came time to celebrate  hah  the waiter ran by and dropped of a pazooky without even a smile  word  or anything. Now don't get me wrong  the Gluten free pazooky was A M A Z I N G  BUT THE SERVICE WAS T E R R I B L E.I was very distraught when I got home because I thought you know  this was my 14 year old birthday dinner AND IT STUNK.I spoke to Manager on duty that evening at around 10pm and guess what  he couldn't find our table or ticket in the system and although he was very consoling on the service  the gift certificates he himself offered so that we might TRY and come back NEVER CAME. SURPRISE SUPRISE.
Paul S.,Long Beach  CA,28,601,20,10/25/2015,3.0,"This is your typical chain restaurant. They do splurge on ambiance. It is quite nice. We actually came to a pizzeria and ordered salads as our main course. I have not been very fond of BJ\'s pizzas  so this is what it\'s come to for me. We also tried their home brews which were just OK. I\'m not a big fan  but I don\'t mind coming here from time to time.=========Commenting on the owner response  unless you\'re inviting patrons over for a sampling of these new/old menu items  I would prefer not to fork over large sums of money on a whim. As I mentioned above  there are some very good dishes at BJ\'s  but I have not been very fond of the pizzas. I know that\'s your bread and butter  but perhaps I just don\'t like the ""style"" of pizza that BJ\'s makes. That\'s just a simple ""agree to disagree"" happy medium."
Sarita N.,Sacramento  CA,93,153,15,7/8/2016,5.0,Great staff and amazing food. The parking was terrible but well worth it once seated. I enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.
Brisa C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,17,48,7/13/2016,1.0,"Came for Dinner with my husband  We ordered the clam chowder  Alfredo  and the new beginning appetizers. We put in our order and the first thing that came out was the soup not the appetizer which wasn\'t such of a big deal. Except.. THERE WAS A STRIP OF PLASTIC INSIDE MY SOUP! Then the main course came which I dont know about you guys but I\'m pretty sure the appetizers come out first. So as we waited for the appetizer to come our food was getting cold. We got the appetizer late then we ate that and the server who by the way was the worst person ever to be working at any chain of restaurant. I\'m not sure what his name was but he was tall skinny African American when we told him about the plastic he responded with ""oh there\'s plastic in there huh would you like. New one? Or just cancel it"" with a smirk as if that happened commonly NO I do not want a new one is it grenade or is it all made with plastic pieces inside? So anyways he took our main course to the warmer and then at that point my husband was upset and told the server we will take it to go he brought the bag without a check and it\'s common sense to bring the check he went about his way to go do something else and by that time We no longer wanted to be served by him or even be there. I was super upset that we would be paying for a meal we didn\'t even eat and we were there for just 20 minutes we didn\'t enjoy our food I didn\'t think it was worth paying 50+ for an experience of that sort. But the money was not the point the point was that that customer service and the dangers of plastic in a soup is ridiculous what if a child was eating that. So I called the manager over and he was kind abit of a smart ass but he took care of the whole meal for us and that was awesome but I\'m not one to complain because I work retail but when it\'s something that I would never want someone else to experience I will say something. All in all never coming back here again I have eaten here countless times but after this visit I\'m sure I will be taking my buisness somewhere else."
Jordana L.,Santa Monica  CA,25,76,42,8/16/2015,3.0,I don't come here expecting stellar food  but in the past it has been consistent and pretty good. Today  my dish had so much water in it that my pasta almost seemed like soup. It also seemed to have taken most of the flavor with it. When I told the server (who came by when I was half done already)  she said that was funny because moat people complain that dish is too dry. Interesting.
Steven R.,Arrowhead  CA,0,2,,7/30/2016,5.0,"Came here on a whim and had the best experience ever! And that was all due to the great service provided by Tara. This was the first time we\'ve been to a large chain restaurant and felt like we were in a comfortable local neighborhood restaurant. Great food and great job Tara! ""Stefan"" and ""Man-Erin"""
Travis I.,Culver City  CA,1090,471,2443,1/2/2013,3.0,"""Her name is Uneeda... As in: U NEED A waitress like her.""The reason for this visit: To see if they rival their neighbors across the mall  Olive Garden  when it comes to AYCE Soup and Salad; sadly  sans breadsticks... Something BJ\'s might consider changing to REALLY compete. Upon our arrival  the hostess greeted and seated us  quickly. The interior was typical of what you\'d expect of a modern  trendy  bistro-like eatery such as BJ\'s. The bar area was quite impressive  and the selection of beers from the tap didn\'t disappoint (after all  they ARE a brewhouse). Our waitress  Uneeda  greeted us with a warm hello and a friendly smile. I\'m telling you  she looks a bit like a mighty fine  younger Michelle Obama. At any rate  her demeanor was exactly what I\'d want if I ran a restaurant like BJ\'s. She immediately noticed my camera and paper pad and took extra time to indulge the foodie in me.Every single plate or bowl she brought out to us was brought with a smile and an explanation of what was in the dish. Either someone in the kitchen was making our plates super pretty or BJ\'s has their plating on LOCK DOWN... I was impressed at the little extra plating techniques that helped elevate the dish from a boring salad to a pretty plate.SOUP.- Tortilla: Not too bad. I bit thick for my liking  but not too bad. A tableside pour made it seem extra cool... a nice touch  indeed. More tortilla strips would be good; even if they are cooked in the broth. I felt the flavor of tortilla was a bit muddled by all the strong chili and cumin flavor. ((It DID have roasted corn  which I quite fancy)) - Minestrone: Good. Lotsa veggies  hearty broth  but the rotini noodles were lost on me. I\'m a die-hard macaroni fan (rigatoni  penne  etc)  when it comes to minestrone. Nonetheless  it was the only soup of which I had two cups. - Broccoli Cheddar: HEAVY. Very thick and cheesy. If they thin it out just slightly and put about twice as much broccoli in it  I\'ll dive in and take a swim. A good attempt  but needs refining  in my opinion. (Just an opinion)- Clam Chowder: This was good  but needed to be served hotter. Texture was good  taste was good  but temperature was lacking. And in a seafood soup  you really want that soup hotter than hell.- Chili con Carne: Creamy Chili?!... No thanks. This was the only true fail. The chili was ber thick  and had a disproportionate dollop of sour cream on it  which turned the chili into a ""dip-like cream of chili."" This did NOT bode well for me.SALAD.- Cesar Salad. The salad was good  but the dressing lacked punch... Maybe it was underdressed. Not the best place to start. Should\'ve started with a simple garden salad.- Wedge. If you don\'t like wedge salads  you can kiss my grits  nootch. Typical preparation with bacon  bleu cheese crumbles  tomato  and red onion... Quite delicious. If I were obese  I\'d eat a gang of these.- Watermelon & Feta. I can\'t tell you how cool it is that BJ\'s offers this salad. Served on a rectangular plate  this fresh and cool salad refreshes you  even on the warmest summer day. A perfect pairing and a definite thumbs up  in my book. (Bring along some candied walnuts or pecans for extra ""pow"" factor)- Caprese. Mozzarella  Tomato  Basil and Balsamic with some shredded Parmesan. Cool plating  good taste. Not the greatest caprese I\'ve ever had  but just the simple squeeze bottle action on the dressing makes a HUGE difference in terms of presentation. Good enough for AYCE  by all means. PIZOOKIE  ON THE HOUSE.- Uneeda told us that we weren\'t leaving without trying their signature dessert: the pizookie. It\'s a piping-hot  pan-cooked chocolate chip cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. I\'m not a fan of sweets  but this was absolutely delightful. Hot and cold temperatures having a party in my mouth?... Hell yeah.OVERALL... The food is good. If it weren\'t for Uneeda\'s exemplary service  I\'d probably have given it two-stars  because chili is REALLY hard to screw up  in my opinion. Furthermore  a less-than-stellar Cesar salad coming from a kitchen that manages to present a delicious Watermelon & Feta salad is gonna get dinged. Lastly  BJ\'s should consider adding bread of some kind to further sweeten this Soup & Salad lunch special. It would certainly serve a couple purposes: It would fill up customers more rapidly and cost-effectively and it would also increase the competition between them and Olive Garden. None of the soups or salads I had truly ""wowed"" me (MAYBE with the exception of the Watermelon & Feta salad  which is just shocking to see as an AYCE menu option)  but there were a couple that fell short of the mark. Nonetheless  this experience was really made enjoyable by Uneeda. Her shining smile and constant efforts to increase our dining pleasure were the reasons we left with the desire to return. So  Uneeda  I take my hat off AND salute you  for you are the true embodiment of awesome service."
Lana S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,1,11/22/2016,1.0,Visited this BJ's last Wednesday  which made me remember why I don't patronize this particular BJ's. My family and I were satisfied until we paid for our meals. We asked for two separate checks  which we received with no problem. The issue was my bill was $66.19 and I paid $70 cash; my daughter's bill was $44 and some change  she paid $45 cash. We waited close to 15 minutes at least for our change. We had to ask another server to ask our server to bring our change and receipts. Our server sent someone else to bring my change ($3.81). My daughter never received her change. I think our server assumed we wanted her to keep it as a tip. However  I had her tip at the table ($10). I was waiting to receive my change to add the $3 with the $10 to leave a tip of $13. We asked to speak to the Manager because we had been waiting so long for our change and receipts. The Assistant General Manager  Felix came to our table. This is when things went South. Our server finally came to give my daughter her change and slammed it down on the table with an attitude (in front of her Manager). I tried to talk to her to let her know I had her tip at the table and I would never leave only a $3 tip. She turned her back and walked away before I could finish my statement. Felix the Manager did not acknowledge her rude  disrespectful and abrupt behavior. When we called it to his attention  he became belligerent with a nasty sarcastic tone . I will never return or patronize this BJ's again. I asked Felix time and time again for his Manager's name. He only insulted my intelligence and wasted my time by never giving me the information. FELIX SHOULD BE FIRED! This incident made me remember Felix and the reason why I don't visit this location. I don't think retraining would help him at this point. Felix exhibits a god-complex  which is very offensive. He lacks customer service skills  conflict resolution and most of respect and professionalism. I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN.
Andrew C.,Los Angeles  CA,118,156,,9/22/2015,3.0,I'm a little surprised the overall rating here is so low. I was here the other night killing time before meeting a few friends in town  and I had a perfectly-fine experience.I ordered their top sirloin  and for $15  that and two sides is a pretty good deal (as opposed to the prices for their pizza  which are way too high). The steak wasn't big  but it had a ton of flavor and was cooked well. My sides of choice were fries and a baked potato. Both were a bit on the bland side  but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't make better.The atmosphere was good. I was seated at a table just off the bar area and took in the football game while eating. One negative note  and this echoes the sentiments of a few other recent reviews: Service wasn't great. It wasn't horrible  but there were one or two times where I had to flag down a waitress and it took a few minutes. Also  someone a few tables down didn't get silverware until after his meal came out.Still  my experience seems better than what some reviewers have had. I wouldn't have a problem coming back at some point.
Bonnie Z.,Palo Alto  CA,70,154,171,9/26/2014,3.0,I come to this BJ's a lot because it's close to my work  and they have some pretty good lunch specials. I usually like getting the unlimited soup and salad.The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the food and the service both vary from day to day  from 1 star to 5 stars...so I'm just averaging it at 3.On good days  the service is quick  waiters are attentive  and the food is very tasty.On bad days  the waiters forget our food orders  the watermelon in my salad is mushy  the clam chowder is too salty...etc.
Kristina G.,Riverside  CA,190,90,1082,6/26/2014,3.0,I've been here a few times now and each time  the hostess's are SO RUDE! Last time I was there  they wouldn't give me a buzzer to let me know when my table was ready. The servers are friendly but the seating needs to be more organized. The food is delicious but is never hot and is barely even warm..it's honestly quite cold . This last time I was there  the root beer was flat but they quickly replaced it with another drink because the root beer wasn't working properly? Hmm. Also  when I take home leftovers  they don't give me a bag to place my box in but I see others with a bag. Order the pizookie! (Even that seems to never be warm hah) I also recommend the grilled chicken pasta with blackened chicken
ed g.,Lawndale  CA,3,17,,2/14/2017,1.0,We had a big order for the office placed today at lunchtime. 8 entrees. We go pick it up and bring it back to our office. We asked for monkey bread with salted ice cream  Nope didnt get it. we had 5 dishes with french fries  Ketchup Nope didnt get it. The chicken salad for 13 dollars does'nt even compare to the picture they have posted on the menu. Half the size for 13 bucks don't bother. the pulled pork sandwich would have been good if we got the extra barbeque sauce like we asked for. Nope So people don't bother with BJs. Plenty of other restaurants around to go to at lunch!!!
Clara W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,2,2/12/2017,1.0,Just left and WORSEEEEEE service ever! I had to go ask for service after 15 minutes of waiting for water. Then took them another 20 to take my order. Short staffed and waiters looked stressed
Mr. X.,Los Angeles  CA,40,23,8,7/30/2014,1.0,EXTREMELY poor service.Was not greeted upon entering.Alejandro  our waiter  was the only server in the area. Ordered: Avocado egg rolls (BURNT)Chicken Sandwich (fries were cold  had them sent back)Balsamic Chicken had very bitter spinach.
Daisy M.,Los Angeles  CA,83,55,138,8/7/2015,4.0,Too many people kind of ghetto. The food is like whatever but the beer is real good all kinds of beer. The desserts r delicious as well. Can't complaint that bad it's inside mall what do u expect. Over all good place to have dinner w ur love ones..
Michaela C.,Van Nuys  CA,0,65,31,7/12/2016,3.0,The food was mediocre for BJ's  but seriously  the main problem is the wait. The host or hostess will make people wait even when there is plenty of seating. And the waiters are slow  too. And even the take out is slow. For a big restaurant to service that many people in a busy location  they really need to step up their game.
Santa M.,Santa Monica  CA,4,111,6,6/16/2016,3.0,Yucky service. Ended up with a tummy ache. Waiter blamed runners for our food being delivered cold. Bad.
Katrina A.,Inglewood  CA,0,5,2,8/9/2016,1.0,Horrible curbside service- ordered @ 12:50p still waiting on my food. Called & server had an attitude said it would be another 5 minutes.... Still waiting with no word from anyone. First time ordering curbside from this location  never again. Never received food  decided to leave after long wait & no customer service provided.
Alexa J.,Henderson  NV,764,68,23,2/21/2016,1.0,"Terrible experience!I looked at Yelp before coming here  and discovered the ""Buy one get one free"" entree  so when we sat down- I asked our server if we could use it. About 10 minutes later  our server came by and said the 2 for $20 offer was not valid until next month.... Which wasn\'t what I asked him about  so after explaining to him again about the BOGO offer  it took him another 10 min or so until he came back and said the offer was still good. We ordered our food  and waiting for around 30 minutes before asking our server how much longer it was going to be. He said they were just waiting for the pizza to be done... So my husband requested that the food that was ready  could just be brought out to the table (we were all very hungry) Anther server came by shorty after and dropped off 3 of the 4 entrees ordered (including the pizza) and the entree I ordered: fries were cold  which was fine... I was hungry so I dove right in.... My husbands entree: pizza (requested no tomatoes) came out covered in tomatoes. He told the server  and the server took it back to the kitchen. About 5 min later  the pizza comes back to the table  with some tomatoes still on it. Clearly the cooks tried to pick off all the tomatoes  and just send it back to us  which is so disgusting- I can only imagine their fingers digging through the pizza  gross! So back to my entree... I was halfway through my sandwich and happened to look down to a giant black curly hair coming out of the middle. Appetite completely lost and at this point  so I went and asked the hostess if I could speak to the manager. She came back and informed me that the manager was busy on a phone call. We waited another 10 minutes until my husband got up to find the manger. At this point- we just wanted to get out of this hell hole! Finally we spoke to the manager  and let him know about our entire experience. He said he would take care of the bill  and was very sorry. I would never in a million years visit this location again  and it\'s definitely put a bad taste in my mouth for BJ\'s in general"
Lucas R.,Los Angeles  CA,12,34,10,6/9/2015,2.0,Haven't even got the food yet when I'm writing this  but I already have some complaints. First off  they didn't have the ales on tap they claimed to  twice. I finally got a bottled Comradeship and they guy brought it without a glass and with the bottle cap on. After we ordered we waited 70 minutes for two pizzas and a small pasta dish. We played games on my phone and I've spent $720 on Amazon. I blame BJ's. Slightly sarcastic  but yeah. This was crazy. Every 3rd table was empty too.
Lilly S.,Brentwood  Los Angeles  CA,57,173,23,5/28/2015,1.0,Generally I love BJs Brewhouse- the one in Westwood and century city are great. But we were at the mall and decided to try this location. By far the worst location I have been to. Absolutely worst service ever!! Our server never came to check on us. We got unlimited soup and salad and she never came for us to get the UNLIMITED SOUP AND SALAD. She was standing around and talking to her coworkers and gossiping  very loudly. Worst service ever. No wonder this location got 2.5 stars!!!
Sarah V.,Alameda  CA,3,9,,7/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Followed up with the manager over a month ago via email as he requested and never heard back...
Kris L.,Los Angeles  CA,192,4,,7/31/2016,1.0,Came with a group  by far the worst experience ever. Our waitress took our order. Then it took 2hrs to bring our food. Not only that orders had to go back from being wrong. Our waitress didn't check on us at all. Nobody was able to get a refill. We ended up getting a new waitor that told us she went home for the day. Then like magic she is clearing off tables. Which one is it? Just by far the WORST!
Jay R.,Culver City  CA,162,51,,6/23/2015,1.0,Given all the recent negative reviews... you have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews from people with less than 5 total reviews. Maybe it's the local labor pool  training  or simply poor management but this location does not operate like a normal BJ's. As a former employee I am appalled at the level of service and their ability to execute the basic fundamentals of a restaurant. I provided my feedback using their web portal only to be sparingly acknowledged by the GM Eugene Ochoa. As someone else pointed out  he's not really committed to service and/or turning this restaurant around. Sad  because I really like the brand and the food. Just not this location.
Kristi O.,Los Alamitos  CA,515,44,10,6/5/2016,4.0,Tiffany was great! She pointed us in the right direction and prevented us from ordering way too much deep dish pizza lol... We got the 2 for $25 deal with Caesar salads  spicy Hawaiian pizza  and chocolate chip pizzookie. We also got a beer sampler with brew house blonde  dos Equis  piranha IPA  and tatonka stout. Everything was pretty good and reasonably priced. It was still a lot of food  so we left with leftovers. He enjoyed the blonde and the dos Equis because of fresher  lighter flavors. The piranha had a rather bitter aftertaste  but it had a good overall flavor. The tatonka had more of a coffee taste than other stouts  but it went down pretty smooth. Overall would definitely recommend this location.
Yvette S.,Inglewood  CA,0,1,,7/12/2016,3.0,Enjoyed my lunch @ bj's staff friendly  Food was good. I would've given it a higher score but this unstable Lady interrupted my pleasant time. She had no consideration for the other diners inside the restaurant.I don't like to see workers being verbally abuse by aggressive customers. I plan to go back in the near future love the food
Rolland I.,Los Angeles  CA,72,22,56,5/7/2015,3.0,"The Service is sorta decent and the food is decent. The Servers need a few classes in "" working smarter  not harder""  and ""how not to look  sound  and act ratchet while Providing Customer Service""!The Servers that waited on my party were not ""bad""  but getting a refill of ANYTHING became a Chore!"
Marla M.,Los Angeles  CA,2,5,,6/27/2016,1.0,TERIBLE!! Worse costumer service ever. Long and unnecessary wait. Waitresses are extremely rude. Never ever going back
Shena C.,Los Angeles  CA,30,53,16,6/10/2016,1.0,"On 3/11/16  my ""curbside"" pizza was incorrect.... The young lady asked if I wanted her to make it over.... Because I was pressed for time  I declined and she advised that she would replace my pizza whenever I came back..... Forward to today  I call to place my order thinking that they would be able to reference this ""credit"" by my name or phone number..... I get lovely ""Eugene""....... He was the epitome of ""NICETY"" aka sarcastic  rude and patronizing......... He wanted me to go through my call list and provide him with the exact day and time I placed my order and hung up while I was speaking to him not once  but  3 times! What did I do? I went through my At&t app and found the exact call and provided the information.....He replaced the order however  I\'m afraid to eat it because he was such a JERK!!!! I\'m waiting on their corporate office to call me back!!!!"
Rashad M.,Palmdale  CA,37,3,,7/24/2016,3.0,I'm giving them 3 stars because the food is usually always good  however the service is up and down. Sometimes the servers concentrate on one side of their assigned area.
Chris G.,Rancho Palos Verdes  CA,775,1176,1383,4/24/2014,3.0,Came here for lunch with 5 people from work. The food pacing was a little slow  especially considering the location was not very crowded. This BJ's is part of the mall  but you can't enter it from inside the mall - kinda strange. I had the lunch special  which was a soup (clam chowder - B grade) and a salad  the food was better than average. I hope to come back and try some BJ's beer  which I know to be tasty from other BJ's experiences.
Christine P.,San Diego  CA,11,50,9,8/21/2015,1.0,I've been to various BJ's restaurants throughout Southern California and I have to say  this is the first time that I've had such bad service through this chain. Our dinner started off on the right foot because we were seating sooner than our wait time  but that's pretty much where it ended. Our server was talking in such a quiet voice that I could barely hear him over the people directly next to us. He took our orders in a timely manner  but never repeated our order back to us. I guess that should've been my clue that something might go wrong  but I honestly never expected to have every single item we ordered be wrong. When I called the mistakes to his attention  instead of being apologetic  he began to raise his voice and be defensive. What? YOU messed up my order because you heard it wrong  that's not my fault. If you were confused  you should have clarified with me. I'll be coming back to BJ's  but never to this location ever again.
Brandon C.,Menifee  CA,58,33,5,4/22/2015,1.0,THE ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER HAD AT A BJ'S. Went in for dinner on Monday and sat at the bar because the last time I didn't sit at the bar the service was extremely slow. Got there at 10 till 5:00. Put our order in at 4:56. Asked the bartender multiple times to scan the BJ's bar code so I could pay in the app. He blew me off every time. Guy next to us got his food. Girl at the end of the bar gets hers. We keep waiting. Bartender says he's going to check on our food. Then rather than check he takes 2 other orders and talks to another patron at the bar. He never checked. Then the guy next to us gets his food  which was ordered about 10 minutes after we ordered. Called the bartender over and asked to cancel our order because the service was poor. He didn't even try to make it right. He just cashed us out  charged us for the two drinks  and went about with his business. We left at 5:30.
Emilio M.,Los Angeles  CA,1345,466,1249,8/6/2012,3.0,"The last time I set foot in to a BJ\'s Brewhouse was a few years ago and it was the one in Westwood (by UCLA...you know the one). Ive always thought their pizza\'s to be merely ""just okay"" and the service better than ""just okay"". So walking in to BJs over the weekend  I was going in knowing what to expect and what to order. I had my heart set on their Blackened Chicken Sandwich. Its my favorite and only thing I ever order.Then something went wrong. Terribly wrong. Its no longer on the menu. GRRRRRRR!""WELL THERE GOES MY WEEKEND!"" I exclaimed to my family as they watched me degenerate in to a pity party on one. To which my wife remarked ""just order something else."".So with that remark...my better half once again (who is the keeper of all the brains and common sense) guides me out of the darkness.I settled for the BBQ tri tip sandwich that was pretty good and served up pretty big. Its served with coleslaw and your choice of waffle or wedge fries. I recommend it. The service was spot on! Our server was polite punctual and in spite of how busy they were he never delayed on a thing.Overall BJs still has plenty to offer and the service is great. I will miss the Blackened Chicken Sandwich and thats why I\'m docking the review a star. Damn you Blackened Chicken Sandwich...I wish I knew how to quit you."
Daniela M.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,6,16,1,11/9/2015,1.0,"Service: our waiter was nice.informed us he was new and trying to learn the menu which I could understand.but never table touched and wasn\'t ever around to find. I feel like the need to properly train them before they throw them out to the sharks. Drinks/food: I got a margarita and my boyfriend got a beer (bottled). My drink came out first and the waiter let us know that the bartender was backed up. I was thinking ""how does he make a margarita and send it out first and not a BOTTLED beer?"" Anyways  our food came and I got the mini deep dish pizza (it was slightly warm) and my boyfriend got the California club flatbread  which were a bit bland. I\'m not the type to complain  I was just really excited for the pazookie! But I never got a chance to order it since our waiter never came by. I was so SAD. I had to grab a different waiter to help us out to get the check.Atmosphere/service: horrible service!hostess was rude as soon as we walked in."
Genesis C.,Valley Glen  Los Angeles  CA,41,72,30,3/17/2015,4.0,Oh how I love this restaurant! Came in on Sunday and got sat pretty quickly.My cousin and I ordered the Avocado rolls as an Appetizer and Holy Moly! Those babies are good!!! We ordered Beers I got the Blonde which I loved and she got the Lighthouse. I ordered a Burger which was delicious and my Cousin got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich which she kept raving about! Overall I enjoyed my time here  the food was good and the drinks were good  the only thing that was bugging me was how rude our waitress was  She was pregnant and idk if she was just in one of those moods but that was why we didn't leave a tip. Customer service is always important  my friends.
Mario H.,Redondo Beach  CA,0,3,,5/28/2015,5.0,If you make it to this location  ask for Brian as your server. I met a buddy of mine for drinks to catch up after work  and Brian took care of us. He was on point when it came to beer and cocktail recommendations  even though he was one of those high brow IPA guys. Brian we look forward to catching up with you the next time we come in...Sincerely The Doctah
P. R.,Culver City  CA,0,9,,7/3/2016,1.0,Horrible service. Food took over an hour to get here. At an hour I told them I wasn't even hungry anymore. Food is good - IF YOU EVER GET SERVED!This is the 3rd time this has happened at the Culver City location. Never coming back.
Trini T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,2,6/20/2017,1.0,the worst restaurant ever!! don't waste your time attending this establishment
Ryan S.,Pasadena  CA,135,416,7,8/17/2014,4.0,We arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday  for lunch. This is your typical BJ's as far as looks inside; however  I always think they have a great pub/causal vibe. We got a booth for two near to a television so we could watch the NFL PreSeason game. During the time of our visit  they had a wonderful 2 for $22 deal  which included a medium pizza  2 salads  and a dessert. We decided to have the buffalo chicken pizza  2 caesar salads  and a salted caramel Pazookie. The pizza was awesome and delicious. The salads were equally great. The Pazookie -- well I think that goes without saying -- it was awesome too!The meal was great. Our server had a good and pleasant attitude; however  I believe was overworked and had one too many tables. He was non-existent at times; however  tried his very best.I give our visit today a 4 out of 5  and would return again.
Sebastian A.,Los Angeles  CA,8,13,2,7/1/2016,4.0,This is definitely my favorite place to go have lunch during the week! I like the quick service and that I can enjoy a cold brew in under an hour!
Eric M.,Santa Monica  CA,364,426,116,3/1/2016,3.0,The customer service is great  but the food is pretty overpriced unless they have the $20 special.
Breann G.,Atlanta  GA,140,3,,3/20/2016,1.0,If you like frozen TV dinners from the grocery store  then you will love this place. Only thing that taste fresh and that is actually good  is the Easy Bake Oven cookie.
Natalie F.,Los Angeles  CA,46,73,786,3/26/2014,1.0,After several ok-to-good experiences at this location  last night's terrible experience was my last.Why I go in the first place: Great deep dish pizza  excellent beer selection  lively atmosphere. What ruined the experience: Our server was non-existent. The food and drink took too long to come out. When it did  the pizza wasn't hot  the pan was merely warm to the touch. She brought us a container for the leftover pizza rather than a pizza box  and didn't offer a bag to carry it out in. Our plates took too long to be cleared. I also noticed this at the table next to us where they stacked their dishes in the middle while having dessert. In the end  I had to find the manager to ask for the check because we couldn't find our server (she apparently left without letting us know another server had taken over the station).The manager pitched in to help out - she took our drink order after we'd been seated and not acknowledged  served the meals  and brought the check - but this was after we'd already waited too long.The things I like about BJ's were completely overshadowed by poor service and I'll be foregoing BJ's next time in favor of a better overall experience.
Rosalyn C.,Long Beach  CA,70,15,7,6/23/2016,5.0,Our Waiter  Jessie L. Was very kind  quick with our service and respectful. After a hard day at work  I honestly can say I feel better with his kind and calm demeanor. Our food was great and he brought water with lemon refills promptly. :)
Nachaka W.,Wilmington  CA,113,70,135,8/20/2015,4.0,I can't get enough of the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts  omg I really love them. The rest of the food is bomb to lol plus my waiter Ernesto is the bomb I love his personality  friendly and funny plus he's cute..
Kas M.,Los Angeles  CA,6,120,147,4/26/2015,4.0,We came here around 7pm  there was a 30 minute wait for our party of two. My honey ordered spinach artichoke dip/chips  deep dish lasagna  strawberry margarita. I ordered avocado rolls  buffalo chicken wings & strawberry mojito. The spinach artichoke dip/chips were delicious  the dip & chips were just cooked. The lasagna tasted like pizza. My avocado rolls were tasty & my wings were okay  I've had better buffalo wings at Tom's Urban. Our waitress Crystal was very attentive. Our total was $74.
Danette C.,Studio City  CA,22,111,23,5/31/2015,2.0,"The service was pretty bad last night. It started with the valet. Horrible. We followed the arrows and pulled up behind a line of cars that were just sitting there empty. We waited a few minutes for someone to come to us. Nothing. Finally we walked all the way up to the valet stand and this guy is just standing there lookong at us as we walked up. I asked if the valet was still open and he seemed visibly annoyed that I asked this. He said yes  they were open and then just handed me a ticket and said $7.00. No smile. No pleasant greeting. No explanation. No apology. Nothing. UghOh! And when I handed him my keys I asked ""Oh do you know which car I\'m in?"" I didn\'t think he knew because we parked so far back. That is how many empty cars that were just waiting there to be parked. This dude immediately responds that yes he knew and tells me the make of my car. So my question is...if he saw us pull up why didn\'t he come over to help us? Initially I didn\'t know what to do! Leave my keys in the car? Bring them with me? I mean  what the hell!!Next we had to deal with the 2 young black hostesses. It was a Saturday night at exactly 7:20pm. Whoever these two chicks are  they should be fired. As hostess you\'re usually the first rep for the restaurant. These two girls were sour faced  dry  unpleasant  unfriendly  dismissive and an overall buzz kill. Why are these two working as greeters when they seem like they can\'t conjure up the energy to freaking give a half smile!?! The worst. I hate bitch set faced hostesses.The girl that actually seated us was nice.Our waiter was Taylor or Tyler. Very nice. But he was overwhelmed. Therefore we were often ignored and got shitty service. He was dealing with a lot of big parties. He needed help. He got very little help. Therefore my party of 5 sat for long periods without getting orders taken...hungry as hell...nobody ever refilled our waters  our appetizer came out and we had no plates or utensils for a long while. I\'m not mad at Taylor/ Tyler. I think he did his best. He had no support. Where were the people to refill water at least?? Damn!!Anyway the broccoli cheese soup had a weird consistency last night like it had been sitting out for too long. But the ahi poke was sooo good. Very fresh. I tool off a star for the crappy valet when we arrived (although the guys were ON IT and friendly when we left at around 10pm) and another star for the two horribly sour hostesses  and the overall slow service.I like this place. It was packed and the energy was great. But the service needs to improve."
Kim P.,West Los Angeles  CA,527,149,567,2/17/2014,1.0,"Horrible! That pretty much says it ALL! How is this place in business? Health Dept.come check BJ""s in Culver City please. They definitely don\'t have a chef in the kitchen just a few cooks a deep fryer and a large microwave."
Martha E.,Hawthorne  CA,21,48,65,8/1/2015,1.0,"I went to BJs after having a long day. We were told the wait was about 20mins and it turned out to be about 10 mins  which was great. I ordered a spinach and artichoke dip  it turned out good. My friend ordered cheddar broccoli bowl  there was barely any soup in there. It was mostly the sourdough bowl. The worst part was that  we also ordered the BJs Classic combo pizza which is a deep dish. We got our pizza and I immediately noticed that it nearly looked like a thin crust and the worst part was that the dough was undercooked. We let our server know and they took our pizza back and placed it back in the oven--now we had to wait even longer to actually eat. They brought the pizza back out and now it was burnt  they saw nothing wrong with it. And to make matters worse  it was still doughy. The manager swung by and said the pizza would be ""on him"". I didn\'t enjoy it  I just picked the toppings and that\'s all I ate. This was the worst pizza I have ever been served/had. We got there around l9:10PM and ended up leaving around 11PM. We were all extremely disappointed."
Caves N.,Los Angeles  CA,1,40,,11/7/2016,1.0,Went yesterday November 6th 2016 around 9pm  Customer Service was the worst the moment I sat down. When we arrived we waited 20 mins after seated I asked for the bathroom and was ignored. Ordered my drink and she gave the 2 other people with me a straw but I didn't receive one asked waitress and had to wait a extra 10 mins for her to bring one  very rude. Second we ordered our food  another 10 mins passed and she came back and said she forgot my husbands order wow. My brother had 2 Pepsi and she didn't put ice in neither cup. Don't know her name but a older Hispanic lady with accent. The bill came out to 95$ for the 3 of us and the food was nasty with horrible service  was better off eating at the food court inside the mall. Please train your Employees  you lost a customer.
Khedra G.,Hawthorne  CA,1,13,1,10/3/2015,5.0,Our server Mekeea was WONDERFUL! I usually take a very long time when deciding on what I want to eat...especially when faced with a larger menu selection. Mekeea was patient  funny  and truly genuine. Other than that  the food is good...totally filling. And  as mentioned in most of the reviews  the PIZOOKIE is delish! I had a 2 in one salted caramel and white chocolate macadamia.
Mia F.,Los Angeles  CA,10,6,,1/22/2016,1.0,Since they opened  I've tried it about and handful of times. With the exception of 1 visit  I've had only bad experiences. The service is terrible  whether busy or not  the service sucks! One time it was empty and it still took 20 minutes to order  then another 20 to get our food. After that experience I emailed corporate about it and they didn't even respond. Last night confirms I will never spend another dollar in that place (even though I wasn't paying last night!). Same thing  waited at least 15 minutes to place drink orders. Our waiter was pretty attentive after that because we mentioned the wait  but it all fell apart at the end.We were brought our bill after we were done eating but my boyfriend decided to have another beer  so the waiter took the bill back. Then he was nowhere to be found for what felt like forever! It reached a point where I went to the front and asked the hostess to close us out. Rather than her sensing my frustration and taking care of us  she proceeded to take my check and $100 bill and disappear to the back to locate the waiter. When he emerged from the back  he proceeds to drop drinks off at another table and spends time with them taking orders or something. He then walked away from their table without even stopping by to apologize for the delay or anything. He had to of known we were pissed because the hostess had given him our bill so I would have expected him to check in with us. Then I spotted him at cash out location  at that point I walked over there asked for my change  it was 10:30pm by this time. I'd say we got there around 8:30pm.One other thing to note  earlier in the experience  my boyfriend went to wash his hands in the men's restroom  and slipped on the wet floor by the sink. Luckily he didn't actually fall but went to tell the manager it needed attention and how serious it could have been. The manager didn't seem to care and didn't even offer to comp us something (not that we needed him to or were expecting it but clearly he wasn't even worried about us possibly complaining the higher ups  which that is next on my to-do list).To top it off my boyfriend ordered the sirloin  which was the smallest piece of meat I've ever seen at a restaurant. All in all  the food wasn't good  then combine that with the worst service ever  I would not recommend!PS  the pizookie is worth a recommendation! But get it to-go!
Em B.,Los Angeles  CA,1,21,,3/1/2015,3.0,The food and drinks always great  when I have been to this location. Three stars are for VA  who is a friendly  energetic  and all around efficient server! I've been bothered in the past by the (ridiculously) long wait time  but the last time I went it wasn't so crowded  so the wait was only about 20 min. (That was with a call ahead for wait list!) There is a really rude hostess there  who thinks she's the queen of the castle  and bosses everyone around from her hostess station by yelling across the room. Annoying  but comical. The bathroom was disgusting. This bothers me because BJ's is a food establishment that has a lot of business  especially this location  so I would think they would want to keep it top notch.
Rosalind C.,Carson  CA,0,3,,12/27/2015,1.0,Was here today and the food was terrible. The brew house burger was dry  the bacon was burnt  the pickles and tomatoes were ice cold  and the bun was stale.  I sent that order back and ordered a mini Italian sausage pizza and it was also sub par with no sauce and over the amount needed of cheese that was clumped together. The crust was also burned... I have been to other locations and will never return here.......
Viktoria K.,North Hollywood  CA,0,27,,11/10/2016,5.0,Thank you Felix for being such a professional and nice manager. But the place needs some improvements at kitchen.
Quincy S.,Los Angeles  CA,13,20,22,8/1/2015,1.0,So last night me and a couple of friends were out and we were hungry so we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza so we chose bj's and when we got there our sever was nice he gave us time on taking our order even when we were indecisive so when we finally chose we had ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer which I thought was really good and my friend ordered the cheddar broccoli bread bowl she let me try and it wasn't half bad but it was more bread than soup little to none actually and me and my other friend decided to get a deep dish together and that was hands down the worst deep dish pizza I've experienced the when it first was brought out to us the pizza look a little flat to be a deep dish and when we tried to take it out of the pan which was another battle trying to get it out of the pan and when we finally did my friend notice the dough was still raw even the waiter noticed it as well and took it back then the manager came out and asked us about then he said he'll put it back in the oven so the second time it came out it looked really burnt around the edges and he also had a hard time taking out the slices and the slices were way uneven then eventually he said that he'll pay for the pizza he clearly knew that it was messed up so when we started eating it again the center of it was still doughy so I pretty much ate off the top and I had to order something else cause I was still hungry I had got the carnita fries now those were really good I'll have to rate the service ie the waiter a four out of five and the pizza the thing we came for a zero very disappointed
Michelle S.,Glassell Park  Los Angeles  CA,0,4,2,1/4/2015,1.0,We didn't get our utensils until we asked for them. We ordered our food  10 mins later our waitress came by to double check our order  since she forgot. When We got our food  it was cold and undercooked. We asked for it to be changed  yet again the second order was unpleasing.  The service was horrible. There were several employees standing around. We began stacking our finished cups and plates  because our waitress took a long time to check on us. After we confronted her about her service she had an attitude. I've never had a problem with another BJ's until today.
Noe ..,Lomita  CA,273,114,17,10/1/2016,1.0,where to start well my wife ad I came last Tuesday for dinner and by far one of the worst experiences ever we only saw our server once not once did we get a refill my burger and fries were cold and my wifes pasta was cold as well when I told the server he got bothered and rudely tells me it looks hot to me I asked for a management team member and they never came so he then takes our food back brings it back says all better all he did was throw it in the microwave guy thought I was stupid I was a prep cook at one point
Courtney K.,Laguna Hills  CA,311,114,86,3/31/2015,4.0,Michael treated us right! We came during playoffs (March madness) on a Sunday. It was pretty busy too. We ordered 3 courses & lots of drinks. We asked lots of questions too! He answered all of them & would always get us whatever we ordered asap! Food was yummy atmosphere was good (great people watching) & my drinks were strong!
Sage D.,Compton  CA,76,4,,2/21/2016,1.0,I was here with friends for my birthday dinner and the waiter Jesse was very rude. He didn't acknowledge a new face at the table  he didn't bring our silverware or ketchup when asked. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and the chicken was pink then the manager wanted to argue with me about it saying that it wasn't.
Hash T.,Los Angeles  CA,6,54,16,2/7/2014,5.0,"When I\'m in this area  I\'m never let down with the food and drinks. The Lemon Drop Martini at happy hour will make any conversation go from  ""ugh I hate life"" to ""what were we talking about "" they\'re the perfect medium. I usually get the delicious Chicken Parmesan. The chicken(real chicken)is perfectly tenderized  the bread crumbs do not taste like they came together packaged in a shipping truck. The creamy sauce and sundried tomatoes are always sweeet  and the broccoli is always freshly steamed  and the mashed potatoes :P fluffy with just the right amount of butter. I cook from scratch  I know food.These chefs are great!! Not to compare but  I will  once I was tempted to try Olive Gardens chicken---- bad idea  terrible  hard  gummy  tasted like I bit into a clone  it was a pitiful decision. I went back to bjs like 3 weeks afterwards and it was superb. So I don\'t know why people are being so harsh  for the last three years I\'ve gone with many different friends we\'ve always had great service and great food.This is not Houston\'s where people have fake smiles. These are real people  maybe try talking to them like they are?Also  I\'d like to point out maybe the people who are giving bad reviews shopped in the mall for 7 hours and are grumpy consuming monsters secretly screaming ""want food now.""As Barthodemulew Simpson would say  ""Cool your jets man.""In all  never ever had a problem here. When I\'m in the area  perfect place to eat. Well priced  freshly made  and generous portions!"
Nito E.,Hawthorne  CA,252,80,38,7/12/2015,2.0,I don't know what's going on here but this location just isn't what it used to be. We waited to be greeted... Waited a lot longer once we were seated and when we got our food  it wasn't worth the wait nor the $$.Only good thing we took from the visit was that a manager took the initiative to take our order after a waitress left us alone waiting over 15 minutes. The problem may not be him but perhaps it's the other staff.
Witney T.,Gardena  CA,0,10,8,5/18/2016,3.0,Waiter seemed a bit irritated couldn't get his name because he didn't have his badge on . . . food was good! Wish you had white rice for jambalaya
Monisha S.,Torrance  Los Angeles  CA,1,8,,4/15/2016,1.0,Had the Mahi Mahi Tacos...they were great. But I'm not at all pleased with the chips on the side. Looks like they gave me the bottom of the bag? Which isn't appealing at all and a pain to eat. There was no way I can use them to dip them into my salsa  or my guacamole...(which the server failed to bring me after asking twice.)
Joshua E.,Oceanside  CA,1,8,1,4/15/2016,1.0,Negative stars  what a bad bar experience. This place had no porters  stouts  & anything else I wanted to drink. The bar service was rude & very unprofessional. I really just wanted to get out of here ASAP while my buddy finished his mojito. That mojito tasted like a blind man took a shot at bartending & served him that. I used to come here a while ago after my deployments & I'm sadly disappointed...
David C.,Redondo Beach  CA,0,10,,11/14/2016,1.0,"Nothing says we have low standards like ""Is Pepsi ok instead"" It makes you wonder about other cheap substitutions."
Marney V.,Long Beach  CA,23,13,4,3/31/2015,1.0,"I am presently here ...And I will never go back here!! Ever!!Far beyond the other branches -highly recommendable!Kindly ask for water and took waiter half an hour. Then after a few ... I just requested to follow-up our order ... Then the waiter rudely say (volume voice raised) ""what do you mean  I already placed order your oder and nothing is there yet!""Talking about well mannered scenario.Everyone is tired from work including her  but a little friendly reply defibrs character of the person and image of this place."
Denise W.,Saratoga  CA,224,120,515,11/10/2013,2.0,This location has THE slowest service ever. Also often hard to find parking.My friend and I come here everytime we are feeling severely drained after a long day/week of school (which is pretty often  maybe once a month or two) because its one of the only places open late around us. There's literally two servers for all those tables  can NEVER flag them down  and the food takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half. Whenever we come it's never even busy yet they cant seem to function smoothly. I'd hate to see how it is on a busy night.I hated BJs for the longest time because everytime i went to one  i've tried to order something different in hopes of a better experience from the last. I never once got a decent fulfilling meal. The only thing I thought was worth getting was the Avocado Egg Rolls.Then one fateful day I came across the Parmesan Crusted Chicken  and the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza(or Great White sometimes) with my friend. It is the perfect combination of a meal. We split the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which comes with mashedpotatoes and broccoli (they split it to two plates for you)  and then share a small pizza so three slices each. If were still hungry we also add a pizookie at the end. Most of the time we eat all this and take home one slice to-go. These two dishes have been the most acceptable to me at BJs and it is the only thing I get now when it is absolutely necessary to resort to this restaurant.(The Seared Ahi Salad is also a recent add on to my OK list.)If only the service was up to par at this location  BJ's would be alright. For now it's still eh in my book.
Alicia B.,Santa Monica  CA,130,97,46,1/19/2016,2.0,Food- average corporate stuff that gets the job done with nothing special. Need a quick meal  it's a doable option. I like that they have an unlimited soup and salad lunch. Service at this location is ALWAYS poor. Every. Single. Time. What can I say- I like broccoli cheese soup. Popped in today for lunch  hoping it would be quick  and spent 15 minutes waiting to even have a server come by. Had a gal I had last time I came here- middle aged lady with a long dirty blonde braid. Ordered my meal- it was fine. Waited for another 10 minutes after I finished to be able to request a check because my gal was MIA. Got check and she took my card. Waited another 25 minutes to get to back. However  when she gave it back to me my card was not with the receipt. Last time I was here  same waitress  this also happened but I did not notice before I left. Called 15 minutes later and the card had magically disappeared. Today  I noticed it immediately  and waited another 10 minutes to ask her for my card. She acted shocked and immediately pulled it from her apron  profusely apologizing and saying she would never have stolen it  it would have been turned in right away. Hopefully that is true- however  make sure to watch for your card here!!! I certainly won't sit in her station again.
Chava D.,Culver City  CA,0,2,,11/5/2016,1.0,Sat at table for 20 minutes  never saw a waiter. Couple next to us was served  waiter didn't acknowledge us. Generally I'm patient but this was a bit extreme.
Fisseha A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,35,,11/16/2014,2.0,"One of the managers (short woman I think Kim is her name) is nuts. She was scolding me like I was her child and was threatening to have me thrown out by mall security. Not making this up. My crime was \'talking down to her\'  \'not talking to her as a person\' and some self absorbed drivel along those lines. I was just complaining about the games being switched. I wasn\'t being a jerk about it. I don\'t/didn\'t drink. I didn\'t raise my voice  didn\'t even leave my seat. My only crime was having the audacity to argue with this woman on a power trip. I just happened to be there when this chick had a meltdown :-) I just came to watch football  eat some wings and talk smack with other fans.This is a sports bar. May be she had a bad day  but I\'ve seen what I consider to be rude bahavior here before and witnessed nothing like this. Needless to say that was the last straw for me. She was probably hoping for the stereotypical angry black man making a scene followed by her ""see what did I tell you"" reassurance  but I\'m afraid I didn\'t live up.I just ignored her. Security left. Her imaginary power disappeared. Amazes me how some people like her survive in the service industry  let alone move up to become managers.Food is Ok. Larry the bartender is a super cool guy and Andrew and Felix are as good as there are. That\'s why I gave it a 2."
Henry B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,5/16/2016,2.0,After reading the reviews there is a lot of truth about the level of service. When they first opened it was an awesome place but now there has been a change. Service is slow and as I observed slow for others. I enjoy the franchise but would probably continue just going to the Burbank location
Raquel C.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,14,46,79,2/9/2015,5.0,"First of all  the beer is great! I suggest you get it by the pitcher-full. You can walk it off in the mall  and have an even better time walking around for hours in a packed mall. The joint was overly filled. We went on a Saturday evening  and the front reception and outside waiting area were crowded. Regardless of that  all of the staff were great and attentive. We had the bison and black/blue burger. They were both great  but the ""coleslaw"" that comes with the bison burger was dry  no slaw for the cole. Also  if you are getting an appetizer  try the corn fritters  they are pretty good."
Nancy B.,Culver City  CA,1,116,95,3/3/2016,3.0,Mediocrity is the best word to describe the food at this location. We've tried the Barbeque chicken salad  the potstickers  their special Mac & cheese  among others and each dish here was completely forgettable. We've been in at lunch and dinner time but the consistent thread here is just a lack of quality on every level. Service was quite slow when there's a crowd and the place is very noisy. Sunday's seem to be a very busy day with an after church kind of crowd and we waited a long time to receive that same mediocre food which was small in portion and honestly a temperature less than desirable. Too many great places to eat in the area to spend $ here again.
Crystal V.,Los Angeles  CA,19,19,1,12/27/2015,1.0,Service was OKAY. But food was cold. And my cousin ordered a pasta and it literally didn't have any sauce on it. When we told our waiter  he brought her a super small side of Alfredo sauce. I ordered a sancwhich which tasted like plastic. Honestly sucks
Alisha B.,Inglewood  CA,0,4,,10/23/2016,2.0,Went there last night the service was terrible  the lady that sat us down didnt check the table before sitting us  the table was dirty  the seat had sauce on it  my glass of water was dirty  my appetizers were brought after my meal  WTH! I think they need new management.
Amit G.,Placentia  CA,0,3,,4/21/2016,1.0,"I wish I could give this place negative remarks. This is the most horrible restaurant I have ever been too and a nightmare to the chair ""Bj\'s"".Here is my story. I have been a huge fan of BJ\'s and specially their avacado eggs rolls   best beginnings and Buffalo Pizza. I can literally eat that everyday. I had many facebook post which showed the check-in in BJ\'s. So my friends knew i am BJ Fnatic. One of friend was visting from NY and as soon as he landed at LAX he said lets go to eat at BJ\'s since he wanted to see why I go there so often. Firstly we order drinks 1 Non-alcholic Pina Colada and one Sam Adams Pitcher. it took forever to drinks to come. First I thought they are trying to bring pina colada and beer together but that was not the case. Even after pina colada came in it took good 10 mins to beer to arrive. OMG next nightmare   the glasses given for beer were wet .. Wait what ? who does that !! I couldnt complain since I was trying to save the name of the restaurant and dont want my friend to feel bad about this. Ok our appetizers was best beginnings and avocado eggs rolls   which came after 35 mins and they were COLD !!!! As if they just came out of fridge after being kept out for sometime. Many of the things in the best beginners was not even eatable. Somehow we ate some and couldnt gulp down rest of it.Main entree was Veggie Pizza and Buffalo Pizza Large. The buffalo pizza was dead cold   this was much colder than the entree. I mean seriously guys   first thing which came in my head   this must have sat on the counter for good 30mins for this to get that cold. The biggest nightmare   the Veggie pizza we order we couldnt eat it in restaurant since we were just 3 of us and we were full so early because of cold food. So when we went home   I was trying to eat Veggie pizza and I found beef piece in it...HOLY SMOKES I dont eat BEEF !!!!! I had to throw that pizza out too.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..... Cleanliness is 0 ...The tables were greesy and so was the menu. I was cleaning everything using my towel..I wont recommend this to anyone.....I have pictures I want to post. I dont know much about Yelp so I will research and post it in a bit..- Amit"
James J.,Los Angeles  CA,2,14,,9/1/2015,4.0,This BJ's is in an excellent location. Right off the highway and in a mall. So the parking is free and plentiful.It's a huge inside eating area  but nothing outside.The layout is nice  there are clean restrooms along with a modern and sleek look at the bar area and dining areas. It's a sports bar so there are plenty of TVs .They also have a full liquor licenses.The food is excellent  especially the pizzas. They are know for them and I have to say they are diverse in what they have to offer. The great white and meat lovers are the best choices to me.Love this place !
Daniel L.,Malibu  CA,17,10,,3/17/2016,1.0,I have to say  one of my WORST lunch experiences EVER! I ordered the half sandwich with fries and soup. The soup was COLD as were the string fries. The fries appeared old and soggy and the sandwich was  in a word  bland! I would have complained except I was being taken out by a colleague. I don't think I will be going back here for lunch anytime soon....or EVER!
Yosxira C.,Inglewood  CA,43,42,28,12/11/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Since the last time I've been here  the service has improved! Our waiter was so nice and accommodating! The great white pizza was made perfectly! The chicken was well cooked and the cheese was melted right! Even the refreshers we received met expectations. Lastly the cookies n cream pazooki was DA BOMB.. Had me knowing the meaning of love with each bite. Overall   VA I believe was his name is the best. I will be back BJS
Matthew S.,Los Angeles  CA,852,27,,2/13/2016,1.0,I'm sorry  this place kind of blows. It's always freezing cold in there and the food is mediocre. The burger is ok but nothing to write home about. Their deep dish pizza is low-rent Numero uno. And drinks are inconsistent. I wish it was better bc I live around the block.
Mary C.,Oxnard  CA,0,17,,3/15/2016,1.0,When the very first person who greets you (the hostess) looks and talks like you're a major inconvenience in her life  then it's already a sucky experience. She was just rude  rude  rude.
Patricia C.,Hawthorne  CA,3,4,,9/27/2016,1.0,My family and myself went to dine there. We got there and host/ess were friendly. We sat down and waited about 5 min for our server to get there. Ordered drinks  10-15 later drinks arrived and got our food order. I ordered a starter salad and that came 10 min after ordering. For our food we had to wait 40 min. In those 40 min we only saw the waitress twice. I don't know where she disappeared to. Food was brought out and mine was missing. Waitress came by 10 min after asking if everything was fine. Told her i didn't get my entree and my husbands utensils were dirty so he asked for another set. 15 minutes passed and nothing  my husband had to get up and get new ones. After 20 minutes the waitress came and said kitchen was working on my food i told her it was ok that i didn't want it anymore. Manager came by  she was really nice. Said they were working on my plate. She discounted my entree and salad. The waitress never came back for any refills or thank us nothing. Ive been in the serving industry for over 9 years and for me this is the worst service ever. I hope you guys train your servers better or management to help around.
Robert M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,40,43,3/13/2016,4.0,Good food. Fair prices. Great selection on beer and mixed drinks.
Larissa G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,3,5/18/2015,5.0,The food is great! Once my boyfriend had to stand up to a waiter due to his attitude! He was so rude beyond belief!! He completed disrespected my mom! He dropped some of our food! My boyfriend followed him  grabbed him & asked him firm  yet politely to change his attitude. He did a whole 360  LOL!! No tip for him!! Last time I went  the waiter was soooo nice  my boyfriend gave him 20$ something dollars in tip  he was great!!
Morgan L.,Inglewood  CA,5,13,23,5/13/2015,3.0,Been wanting to try BJ's for some time took my nephew for his Birthday lunch it was very disappointing except for the drinks the calimari was over cooked the buns were dry on the burgers and for 40 bucks it should have been one of the better burgers we've had.
Ash M.,Los Angeles  CA,556,56,27,6/30/2013,5.0,I'm a fan of BJ's. I always stick to what I know which is the small  buffalo chicken pizza with the buffalo chicken wontons appetizers and a red velvet pizookie for dessert! It's when people start venturing out and testing new things  that the service becomes bad. My biggest advice is to stick to what you know!!! Also  be very very very careful when walking in and out and around this place. You definitely can't ever think you're too cute without tripping  slipping or close to death falling. TRUST ME!!! Other than that  I give this location. 5 stars! My service is always great. The environment is always positive. And there's ALWAYS someone attractive to glance at!!! ALWAYS!!!
Mosi O.,Bellflower  CA,1,25,10,3/20/2016,3.0,This was my 1st visit at this location. Our server was excellent and she deserved the tip we left her. The food selection was great. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. The only issue that our whole group had was at the end of our experience. We were rushed out because they needed our seats for another large party...2.20.16!
Alexis P.,Santa Monica  CA,2,13,1,10/27/2014,3.0,"Don\'t waste your time at a table  you\'ll be waiting forever...This review is for the bar service... Sitting at the bar is your best bet because the ""bar servers"" forget about you... All the time.. I went here alone and the waitress asked if I was meeting someone. I said yes but not for awhile.. Before I could get awhile out she turned and walked away!! SMH I guess that means there\'s no drinking alone at this bar.. So I finally flag her down for a dirty martini and I probably should have kept it clean. I got a glass full of olive juice.. Ehhh Anyway  the happy hour is mon-thurs 3-7 and sun-thurs 10-close.. And during any big game  its happy hour as well.. Only reason I\'d come back.."
Sean S.,Los Angeles  CA,3,14,4,5/31/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I guess we are more experienced on how to order at BJ's . You order appetizers and when you are done- pizza. That way you get piping hot pizza on your table. ... And it's not that cold anymore- maybe they listened.Anyway- I do like BJ's
Lynette J.,Los Angeles  CA,36,37,4,2/15/2016,2.0,I love BJs but the service here sucks. The waiter was nice but everything was sooooo sloooooow. We didn't even get the appetizer ww ordered.
Miranda C.,Hesperia  CA,111,1,,9/10/2016,1.0,"I\'m only giving one star because I have to. This was seriously the worst experience at Bj\'s I have ever had. First time ever at this specific location. We walked in and got absolutely no greeting from either hostess up front. Which apparently set the tone for the whole dining experience. No server in the whole restaurant was smiling or friendly. Our server  Rachel seemed to have hated her job. She did not greet us  just asked what we wanted to drink as soon as she came up to the table. We ordered and to our food was not even mediocre. Cold fries  super tiny stuffed mushrooms  and cold pizza as well. We did not bring it to her attention however  because it seemed like she disappeared for up to 20 minutes at a time. We sat with empty glasses a good portion of the meal. Our drinks were refilled once the whole time. After we had eaten  we got asked ""are you done? Or any dessert?"" not friendly at all. But  nonetheless  who can refuse a pazookie? When it came to the table she put the book down and said nothing  we had no clue it was even there. Then she comes back not even 2 minutes later and goes is this for me? When it finally was ready she took it without a word and returned it without so much as a bye  thank you  or have a nice day. Also  during the stay I used the restroom where an employee was standing in front of the sink and playing with her hair while chatting on the phone. I needed to wash my hands and the employee just stood there and didn\'t excuse herself to allow me to wash my hands. It was nothing I would\'ve expected at a Bj\'s."
Alice V.,Hawthorne  CA,0,8,,8/26/2016,1.0,I went with my family we order the appetizer to start but the avocados roll where burn .I told the waitresse and she just look at me and she told me that does the wait they should be  I told her I come here all the time and there not burn there crunchy but not burn...she was like what to you want me to do..and I told her I want you to exchange them she's like I need to bring the manager the manager was so rude...I always stop here for drinks but not nomore ..in the pass i have enjoined but not yesterday even my sourdough bread for my clam chowder was burn....I had to wait for manager  wait another 30min for avocado rolls
Veronica R.,Los Angeles  CA,217,469,89,11/23/2013,2.0,The food and drinks are always ok. Nothing great nothing bad. But man the hostess and some waiters are so ridiculously bad!!! So rude they swear they're not working at a Westfield BJ's. It's like come on leave the attitude at home.Overall I mostly come here during the day when it's at least more bearable. But I suggest to hop on the 90 and go to the Yard house.
Carlos B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,2,3/27/2016,2.0,I had never eaten here and to start off it was pretty good. The pan pizza was decent. Beer wasn't too expensive either. The thing that ruined the experience for me was dessert. I ordered a pizookie (not sure on the spelling there) and when it arrived the spoons were caked in food. Rather than offering anything at all the waiter took the dessert away and brought the check. I don't want anything for free but I still wanted dessert. That really brought down what was otherwise an alright dining experience.
Bri N.,Los Angeles  CA,3,34,24,8/19/2014,2.0,"Wow! There is nothing more outrageous than walking into an establishment that runs purely off of customers dining here to be greeted by the rudest  most unprofessional host. My husband and I walked into the front doors and immediately made eye contact with the hostess  Contessa. She turned away from us and stood by the menus and acted like she was taking notes on what tables would be opening soon. Not once did she acknowledge us by a smile  greeting or even a pathetic ""I\'ll be right with you."" Nothing....I immediately note the time and see how long we have to wait at the front before we are greeted. It took her 3 minutes to stare at tables before walking back over to take our name. They were on a small wait (10 minutes) just because your pregnant doesn\'t mean you have the right to ignore us and give us your disgusting attitude!I asked for her name because managers need to know how they are treated and will even determine if my family will ever entertain here again. Our server Shawn totally made up for Contessa\'s poor behavior. He was friendly  timely and our food was great."
Shalia T.,Gardena  CA,42,1,,7/5/2015,3.0,we were seated immediately even after being told it would be a 20 minute wait that was awesome. After being seated we absent mindedly waited an additional 30 minutes for our waitress. directly across from us we watched a party of 2 finish off their dinner then another party of 4 be seated in their place who then began to order and still no help. i had to flag down a bus boy to let him know we hadn't been helped. the food was OK; my celery was not hewn but white. the waitress never bought my girlfriend her drink. this is probably my 5th visit to this location and I've never had a problem before. im assuming the waitress was new. She was forgetful and seemed timid.i tried the the berry burst beer it was good and fruity. the Jeremiah red beer had a sparkling wine taste to it.
David W.,Los Angeles  CA,9,30,,2/5/2016,1.0,Man  what a shithole. Now I know why I've never gone to this place before. I had a half chicken club sandwich and wedge salad. Disgusting. The salad was very wet and had no flavor. The chicken was chewy and the fries were stale. I felt bad for the wait staff. Never again. Please learn from my mistake and let's shut this hell hole down  together.
Kool P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,19,9/14/2016,5.0,This Review is solely for Garrett (spelling ) he is a very positive energy and kind server ! Totally made my experience forget I was at a meat house lol (I'm vegan ) so I was very thankful for the humble service ... Keep it up !
John S.,Los Angeles  CA,4,58,13,11/11/2015,5.0,Quality food. The veterans day special was great and the staff was nice. Everything tasted as planned  A+.
Nikkia M.,Los Angeles  CA,50,42,314,10/9/2015,2.0,I hate coming to this place! The wait is so damn long. I was told 25mins and it's been 45mins and still waiting. I would leave but what there else to eat around here. I should brought my own snack and drinks while I wait.....
Tiarra ..,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,2,9/11/2016,5.0,Mike at the bar was awesome!!! He kept checking on us  made my boyfriend and I great drinks and made sure we were okay throughout our visit!! 5 stars for him! Best employee I've experienced here everrrr
Mi T.,Long Beach  CA,87,1000,47,12/18/2014,3.0,If you know me you know i dislike generic bland food. But.. i had a pizzone? I dont know what they call it. But it was a melty cookie with ice cream. It was soooo good!!
Lajuene R.,Gardena  CA,0,10,8,3/29/2015,3.0,I've been to this particular BJ's quite a few times and I have had some good and not so good experiences. This particular time was ok. It was a bit crowded  but we were seated within 15min. We waited a little while for our food and it was ok.The customer service could have been a little better. I don't want to go into too much detail (but that's the reason for the review right?)  but overall it was ok.
L J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,202,21,10/28/2015,3.0,This location has less of a pub feel to it and for that reason I like it as it seems a little more sophisticated. However  the service here was pretty bad. Our server herself was really sweet and I've been a server so know you often have to wait for the kitchen staff but they need to step up their game because ultimately the server is probably the one losing out when it come to tips.
Crystal M.,Seattle  WA,251,227,1999,2/2/2014,5.0,Great service and very accommodating. Always lots if TV and lots of pizza.A must try pizookie!!! Can't go wrong with the triple chocolate. Or really any. Deep dish is good  free parking  sit in bar to actually hear the tv though.
DP G.,Torrance  CA,0,30,25,1/15/2016,1.0,Bartenders have a poor attitude. In a bar that makes it or breaks it. I moved to the area 6 months ago and have gone several times to this BJs. Each time I am greeted with disinterest and then treated like I am a bother to the bartenders. They are rude  purposely slow and really overall just kind of miserable. Like they don't want to be there. I can only guess this poor attitude comes from management. That type of thing trickles down. It's too bad because I have always loved BJs... Go to the West Covina BJs and STAY CLEAR of this one.
Anne B.,Long Beach  CA,51,109,5,1/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,A friend wanted to hang out on New Years  and we were trying to pick a spot that was halfway between where both of us lived. We decided to meet for lunch at this mall  and I picked BJ's since I have a few gift cards. Unlike the last visit to this BJ's  the service was wonderful. The waitress was friendly and attentive  and we were wished a good day by several employees as we left. The food was okay; I LOVED the clam chowder  but I didn't like the wedge fries  and I could have made a better pesto chicken sandwich at home (it was good; but I could have done better). I won't be returning regularly to this BJ's  but I will no longer avoid it like the plague when I'm in the area.
June S.,Los Angeles  CA,17,32,12,7/30/2015,1.0,"It\'s really sad to think that the BJ\'s I once thought was a pretty decent restaurant  is actually a giant chain heating up their signature commercialized freezer food... At least that\'s what most of their food tastes like. I\'ve been to several locations  like Tustin  Century City  and a few others  but this location is probably the least impressive. Came here for my parent\'s birthday because my mom wanted to use her coupon for a free appetizer. We ordered the fried calamari  which came out pretty quickly  though nothing special. I ordered the North Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and Shrimps  which is kinda like a cioppino with cous-cous. A little salty from the kalamata olives  but I liked it. What I didn\'t appreciate was that my mom\'s burger came out more medium-rare when she ordered medium-well. And. My sister\'s burger first came out medium-well when she ordered medium-rare. She sent it back and the second time around  got a pretty well done burger with rare bits along the edges. She expressed her concerns to the waiter  who informed the manager. The manager came over and apologized  offered her another burger to go and then sent out some free pizookies. There was almost no point  seeing as my sister had already eaten most of the burger because she was that hungry and didnt want to wait for another burger. I appreciate their efforts to rectify the burger situation  but it sorta just goes to show how things are running in the kitchen. Maybe no ones paying attention to the grill? Do they know how long to cook a burger to different degrees? Not to mention  my dad\'s shrimp scampi pasta was beyond dry. Like  absolutely no sauce to spare. Not even olive oil collected at the bottom. Dry dry dry. He ate it because he\'s not the type to say something even though he was unhappy about his own birthday meal.I\'d avoid this location if you can help it. If you really want some ""American"" food  there\'s a Five Guys right next door to Forever 21. Pretty sure you can get a better burger for your buck.."
Science Lady B.,Las Vegas  NV,20,24,17,11/29/2015,3.0,I had just arrived in town and stopped in to my favorite location..the waitress Tiffany was great...excellent attitude and lots of attention. It took over 1 1/2 to get our order and the manager brought it to us and apologized which was great..They did comp my meal but I would much rather have my meal in a timely manner.The customer service has always been outstanding and I have been coming to this location since it opened but I hope they get it together...I will say I love the century city location just a bit more..
Nicole W.,Los Angeles  CA,4,43,,11/24/2015,3.0,Andrew was an awesome server  he really saved the day and took up the slack. I don't know this first guy with short blonde hair  but it must have been the end of his shift. There was no warm hand off. He didn't bring napkins  a straw  no silverware  no smile. I didn't feel welcomed. I don't make much money so this was a splurge for me.
Justin W.,Los Angeles  CA,6,4,,8/21/2015,1.0,"I come to diz location cuz they be smokin\' up them burgers I hear about all the time. When me and this ""great burger"" come face to face  we both say  ""uh uh."" The waiter was very rude and careless  probably didn\'t learn his manners from his mama."
Jennifer W.,Los Angeles  CA,101,175,123,4/9/2013,2.0,I want to like this place more than I actually do. I don't know why  but I always struggle to find something on the menu that I actually want to eat. This most recent visit  I settled on an individual pizza and small cesar salad. Pretty good combo. The cesar salad was good  and just the right size. The pizza was...ok. And I love me some pizza. I would rather have eh pizza than no pizza at all. The crust on the hand tossed 'za was good  but the middle was soggy and limp.I shared a few wings with the girls  and they were good. We had them put the wing sauce on the size  not tossed  so that the wings didn't get soggy.For dessert  we had the pizookie trio...which works out perfectly if you have 3 people that want the mini sized cookie dessert. Each person can choose their own flavor and have a perfect portion sized dessert.Our waitress was awesome! She was upbeat  energetic and checked in on us. We had some issues with dirty silverware...one fork was literally stuck to a napkin  and we got 3 dirty spoons with our dessert. WIthout us asking or making a fuss  she went to the manager and had dessert comped for us. So nice of her!Bonus: plenty of free parking (for now) at the Fox Hills MallBogus: there always seems to be a wait  especially on the weekends. We waited about 20 min on a Sunday night at 7pm.
Daniel S.,Los Angeles  CA,135,71,42,4/6/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Sit at the bar tables and request Jane' . Very friendly and helpful. Will be back again.
Monica R.,Whittier  CA,67,12,,2/22/2016,1.0,Service and food used to be better 2 years ago. Not sure what happened since but now the food is just not good. I used to go to this BJ's sometimes twice a week and now I regret when I do make it back. I was there Friday and it took the bartender 15min (we sat at the bar) to ask for our order (mind you this is during lunch). They appetizers came at the same time as our food (30min later).... just doesn't make sense. Tried one of their new dishes and was flavor-less. Needless to say I won't be going back.
Monique J.,Inglewood  CA,0,11,3,2/21/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Chose BJ""s for out girls day out spot to eat. We were seated all the way in the back  and now know apparently that\'s reserved for buffet style parties. My friends and I were there for a few hours  with no one telling us its a large party using that area and the time of their arrival. The manager came over and was extremely rude. He was so pushy. Kept sending the bus boys to take our glasses and plates before we could even get our tab together!! Our waitress was extremely nice and very accommodating. But the manager was absolutely horrible!!"
Mimi N.,Novi  MI,3,4,2,11/15/2015,1.0,Last night 6 of us stopped by to celebrate an event that went well nearby. We arrived well past the normal dinner rush  at 9pm.. Grabbed a table in the open seating bar area. 1) We made no change to the seats  but were asked to move 1 chair bc it was 'in the way of servers'. Okay  makes sense  but why didn't one of the many employees walking past move it while empty  before we sat down and had been waiting to be greeted? 2) Drink orders arrive - WEAK. The mojito was sugar water. They also arrived to the wrong people.. We fixed. 3) Order apps with no issue. Delivered  with no silverware - another server helped us out. 4) Apps have been finished for a solid 10 minutes before we have to flag down our server & ask to order. He just stares angrily  opens his notepad and waits. Zero words lol. 5) Food arrives 45+ minutes later.. Watched 2 tables that arrived after us receive their food. This is where we all get pretty grumpy 6) My burger is well done and cold but I'm starving so I stay quiet. 7) Food arrived without 1 order - that one shows up 20 minutes later when we are all done. At this point we've barely had acknowledgment from our server & he hasn't said more than 'sorry'. Doesn't ask if everything is ok  if he can get us anything else  etc. The classic drop & dash 8) We call a manager. He offers us dessert - that's great! The issue is we don't want to wait. He assures us they will be out very quickly. 9) 15 minutes later we flag down our server & ask for our checks  as well as the desserts to be boxed. The apparently cannot do this because they would need to be remade. 10) Check arrives in 1 (WTH?!) - we do the splits 11) Desserts arrive & one is cold. Overall things went from 'meh' to comically bad. 2 of us have been bartenders/servers for years and had no words to help placate our group. We left tips but the lowest most of us had ever left. The was an entire Server-Kitchen-Management fail. Obviously none of us 6 will come back or recommend this place. Get your sh*t together BJs!!
Julie P.,Los Angeles  CA,159,237,245,11/12/2013,1.0,I don't know. Overpriced for mediocre food. The waitress was great. Her name was Tequila and was constantly checking in on me. However  the girl who escorted us to the table put us all the way in the corner and by the wall. The restaurant was empty. I have no idea why she would put us in the most horrible spot. The restaurant was super cold as well. BJ's always seem like a good idea at the time. I wouldn't go back.Paid over $50 for 3 beers  stuffed mushrooms and a small pizza (which was horrible).
Mai K.,Santa Monica  CA,187,149,77,6/30/2013,3.0,My friend and I got seated within 10 minutes  which was nice. Our waiter was pretty attentive. We ordered the corn fritters as a starter -- I would definitely recommend it. It's only $3 for four pieces of H-E-A-V-E-N. I wish we had ordered more of this blend of corn  flour  aioli  and bacon. This aioli was really good! We both ordered burgers -- my friend ordered the jalapeno burger and I got the new bison burger. Both were medium well. I've never had bison  which is why I wanted to try  but it tastes pretty much like beef  haha. I thought my burger was pretty dry and my friend shared a similar opinion on hers. She only had like a dollop of aioli at the top of her patty  too. For dessert  I was stuck between the new summer berry/candied peach cobbler and a similar-sounding blend of deep-dish berries  both with vanilla bean ice cream on top. I decided to go with the former  but our waiter ended up confusing the two (understandably..) and gave me the wrong dessert. It wasn't that big a deal since the two are similar. All in all  this BJs is good. I just wish their burgers weren't so dry!
Elizabeth Marie C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,2/16/2016,1.0,We decided to go here for my sisters birthday and oh did we regret it! I am so disappointed in the customer service this place has  our server was not friendly at all and she was overall rude. I will not be returning
Ricky H.,Redondo Beach  CA,38,126,6,1/27/2016,2.0,Stopped by on a tuesday wasnt very busy but for some reason took a very long time to get served ordered a appetizer didnt get it till the food came had to go track down the server for a fork because he took it with my salad bowl and didnt replace it. service was polite when you did get his attention but was around enough
Ivy W.,Los Angeles  CA,1521,1308,2750,1/22/2013,3.0,Not a fan of BJ's but we came for a work lunch as it's nearby. Parking is a hassle  so we valeted. Main entrance is annoying and inefficient as it's a turnstile  revolving door. Restaurant is quite large and open with high ceilings  so it's a lot nicer than most BJ's I've been to.Being a party of five  we were seated at a booth. Waitress quickly got our drink orders and brought them. She was short  which could've been mistaken for as rudeness  but she was efficient and got the job done. We ordered two appetizers  one large pizza  and a dessert to share.Spinach & Artichoke DipNothing to write home about  nor complain. Very basic. Comparable to the one at California Pizza Chicken.Chicken Lettuce WrapsDidn't try this  so I don't have an opinion. My coworkers all loved it.Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-We asked for bacon on the side  but it was pretty good without it. The photos on their menu make the pizzas look super thick and fluffy... which was not how the pizza looked in real life. It was still a thicker crust than how I normally like it though  as I prefer NY style thin crust. I wouldn't mind ordering this again.Chocolate Chip PizookieEveryone's so obsessed with pizookies  and while I admit they're good  they're not as divine as everyone makes them out to be. What's so special about a warm cookie with ice cream? I don't get it. Since it was also one of my co-worker's birthday  our waitress was kind enough to give her a complimentary mini pizookie. I really like their cookie and ice cream ratio as most restaurants usually skimp out on the latter.Like with all chain restaurants  you really can't expect much. Both service and food were mediocre. Will only come back if I have no say in where to dine.
Daniela F.,Calabasas  CA,32,44,24,12/9/2015,5.0,So decpite the bad reviews they been have came here with my boyfriend was a bit worried cuz of the area.. but we had no issues. It was a Saturday and it was packed we waited for a table probably for like 25-30mins. They sat us down in the worst table I have t I say. . Lol the only bad thing I have to say . The food was pretty good I had a hamburger that left out with a food baby lmao I'd wish I could remember the waiters name he was nice and attentive . They had forgot bacon on my bf dish and had asked if he wanted a new dish or to just bring out what was missing . Over all besides the seating it was good
Chase M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,11/1/2015,2.0,Food is decent but have had too many problems with this place. On different occasions I have been charged for a dinner portion while receiving a smaller lunch portion  and now I had a delivery thanks to door dash but I ordered 5 things and only one showed up. They claimed that the spoke to us but never did. I was only charged for one thing but it is still unexceptable
Michael S.,Vancouver  WA,4451,2211,19020,10/28/2010,3.0,It's a pizza restaurant ... It's a brewery ... It's a bar with late nite happy hour ... It's BJ's and it's in Culver City. I hadn't been back to BJ's since becoming a yelper  so  this past weekend during late night Happy Hour  we joined the crowd in the bar area looking for deals. The prices are better than regularly advertised  but still kind of high for the quality.We started with Classic Pulled Pork Sliders with roasted pulled pork  crispy onion strings  and BJ's smoky BBQ ranch sauce made with Jeremiah Red Ale. It comes with a side of coleslaw. They actually hit the spot. I liked them.Chicken Tenders with Honey Mustard Dressing came at the same time and didn't really stand out as anything special. A basic and safe choice  but can't really recommend them.The best deal for happy hour is the mini-size pizza. We chose a Southwestern Pizza with chipotle tomato sauce  spicy blackened chicken  green chilies  cheddar cheese  diced tomatoes  and cilantro. It was a cheesy  bready mix of flavors. Kind of satisfying and disturbing at the same time.For drinks I went with my favorite BJ's brew: the Irish-style Jeremiah Red Ale. It's more malty than hoppy which is why it tastes so good. The kick is nice at is 7.3% alcohol  too. Olivia Z. got a couple Ultimate Long Islands. She liked the blend of ABSOLUT Vodka  Tanqueray Gin  Bacardi Rum  and Cointreau Orange Liqueur  however  the Tanqueray overpowered the other flavors. Would have been better with Bombay Sapphire. We didn't need dessert  but got it anyways. The Pizookie Trio is for sharing and that's just what we did. It comes with Three mini Pizookies served with one scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Our choices: Chocolate Chunk  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  and Peanut Butter . The white chocolate macadamia cookie was the winner of the three. I'd avoid the PB one altogether next time.Service was kind of slow at times since there seemed to only be two waitresses patrolling the bar area. More than once we had empty drinks or were waiting on the next food item. Parking is easy in the mall lot.Despite being slightly overpriced happy hour items with slow service  BJ's Restaurant and Brewery earns a solid 3 stars for satisfying my late-night need for food and brews.
Maria T.,Los Angeles  CA,146,86,10,7/30/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Wow  20 min for waiter to greet us at table and order our drinks. Additional 15 min to get appetizer. Add another 20 for entree. A regular here and usually good service but perplexed by tonight since it's not busy.
Dessilina C.,Los Angeles  CA,419,65,24,11/15/2014,1.0,On a date night. Walked in and was ignored by the first hostess. Then was told we will be helped was passed up by another couple. Once seated I noticed we were seated next to two tables of ppl that has a Cough. So waited ten minutes for the waiter  another five or ten minutes to bring soup. And the server only brought out one soup. When two was ordered. I expect the crowd. I just know when to come and dine. Mind now 20minutes and no one has come to bring the other soup of check on us.
Maria R.,Culver City  CA,64,1,,1/19/2016,5.0,Not sure what beer to have? JEREMIAH RED! It's not too bitter nor too sweet rather strong :) one does it for me :)
Liza R.,Culver City  CA,0,3,,7/31/2015,1.0,The service is mediocre! They need to retrain their staff. Although they aren't rude  they're definitely not the most friendly either!
Simone T.,Los Angeles  CA,147,560,1066,10/22/2014,3.0,We come to this location frequently because it's conveniently at the mall. The food is good I love the corn fritter appetizers and of course the pizookie (triple chocolate). The problem is even though the staff is nice and friendly here the service could be rather slow so we never really get all the attention we deserve and pay for.
Trent N.,Los Angeles  CA,49,7,8,6/17/2014,2.0,"Welcome to the epitome of failed American dining. Not only did we wait an hour after we called in to get ourselves on the priority wait list  we also had to wait an extra hour for my friend\'s deep dish pizza because ""something happened to it.""The food was mediocre. My friend\'s burger looked like they shot a cow and the cow fell onto his plate. My fish dish had some awkwardly smudged spicy sauce that looks like a bulldozer overran the plate. This place only gets two stars because the two hour deep dish pizza was actually a tad satisfying."
Oswaldo P.,Los Angeles  CA,11,48,31,8/22/2014,2.0,Subpar experience here at BJ  I feel like this restaurant has run its course. Not enough TV's  food is mediocre at best. Last time I come back. Friday night and the service is extremely slow and the place isn't even full. Must say the staff is friendly though. Ozzy P out.
Adam T.,Torrance  CA,157,3,,7/2/2016,5.0,I don't usually leave reviews  but I had a pretty good experience at this restaraunt. I had a waitress by the name of Amanda who was extremely nice and constantly checked up on us. Will be coming back to this location again.
Kimberly R.,SYLMAR  CA,96,155,19,11/21/2015,4.0,I've been to this location several times and the food has been tasty. Mind you I've only had the pizza and starters and drinks. The service is always friendly.
Marissa T.,San Diego  CA,1,18,,5/4/2014,1.0,"I was in Culver City Friday night and wanted some late night take out. I found that BJs is open late till 1 AM on Fridays  so that made me happy! (5 stars for being open late).The rest of this review is for their take out service: I wanted the ability to just pick up my order  and was kinda fascinated with the idea that they will take your food out to your car when you arrive. -- that didn\'t happen.Called at 9:30 pm for a take out order. Someone answered  but had to ""transfer me to the take out counter""  waited for 5 minutes  no answer. Then finally another gentleman picked up and said ""can you hold?"" And then they hung up after I waited on the line for another 10 minutes. The 2nd time I called  I had already arrived in the parking lot by then  they put me on hold for 12 minutes  then I hung up. Oh my goodness. 1 star for take out phone service as I was never able to talk to anyone to take my order.Since I was already in the parking lot  and I was determined to get a cheese burger  and no one else was open that late  I got out of my car and walked in to the restaurant. The place was semi full for a Friday night  but what appalled me the most was they had 3 hosts standing behind the host bar  and 1 person at the take out counter. And many waiters and waitresses in and around the restaurant. I stood at the takeout counter for them to take my order. Their phone was ringing and they did not bother to pick up. A couple and a college student were standing by waiting for their order. We all waited about 35 min to get our orders  because the staff did not communicate to us that out order was ready (I\'m guessing it was ready after 10-15 min)  even though they took our names. 1 star for lack of communication to patrons.Peeved. After everything it took me about 50 min (including phone time) to grab a burger at BJs."
Doyle Ray T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,6,7/21/2014,2.0,I took my family here because my wife like a well made desert. *Time of day: During the World Cup - USA & Portugal*Wait: 15-20 mins*Wait for Food: Pretty much served on time. My kids got their food first which was good. The food was not bad.Service: Our waiter was professional but seemed annoyed throughout our visit. My drink was Never attended to or refilled. I come from a place that customer service plays a key factor of making sure your customer will want to come back and mostly talk about their positive experience to friends and family. I recommend BJ's management to read: Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service.
Noel K.,Brentwood  CA,141,358,78,10/15/2014,2.0,The food at BJ's defines average. The service was decent when I dined here on a Saturday afternoon with my family. We were hungry. We ate. Nothing to write home about and it is unlikely we would dine at BJ's again.
Crissy L.,Santa Monica  CA,0,119,6,1/10/2016,2.0,I should've checked the Yelp reviews for the restaurant before ordering delivery on LA Bite. Doh! I was too in a rush and remembered the food at the Westwood location was decent when I had eaten there a long time ago.Pizza was gross. That's the bottom line. I'm not sure it even qualified as a pizza because it was just bread and cheese  no sauce. It was way too salty (to the point where I almost just threw the pizza away)  and the tomatoes they put on top were canned tomatoes. WTF. Canned tomatoes on a pizza? Super gross.My boyfriend got the turkey burger  and he said the texture of the burger was really strange. The patty was mushy... as if the burger wasn't 100% turkey and there was some kind of grain mixed in. He didn't care for it.I would've given the place one star  but the pizookie was delish. Can't beat super fatty buttery cookies and ice cream!
Jo C.,Westlake Village  CA,87,42,10,8/16/2014,3.0,"I normally don\'t like to write bad reviews but...This particular BJ\'s needs HELP! with capital letters and an exclamation mark! Though our food was fine  the service itself was not fine. I did think our server was nice but she along with the whole establishment need a service overhaul. Food took way too long to come out. Especially since it wasn\'t busy. This was around 2:30-3 in the afternoon. Not a big deal but I asked for an Arnold Palmer (ice tea/lemonade) and got an iced tea. My mother did ask for iced tea but had to wait for the server to come back to ask for sweetner. None on table. We were never asked if we wanted drink refills later on. My kid ended up drinking the rest of mine. Had to wait for an order of fries 10-15 minutes after the fact the actual entre was brought out. No condiments were ever brought out or were asked if we needed them. I ended up getting them myself from another nearby server. Initially  our server apologized for her taking too long to take our order  ""I\'m sorry for the wait. I\'ve been dealing with these two ladies who keep asking for stuff."" Really?? Isn\'t that what you do? And once again  it ain\'t that busy.Needless to say  it was a disappointing experience. We\'ll stick to the BJ\'s we know and love by our neighborhood. Westlake and Century City should show them how it\'s done. There seems to be a happy vibe at other BJ\'s but this one...not so much. An aire of indifference is what describes them. To be fair  I did give them a 3 based on the quality of food which was very good. If it weren\'t for that  I would\'ve given them a 1."
Diana R.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,12,22,2,9/20/2015,2.0,I came here with family because we were celebrating my brother-in-laws birthday. We were a group of about 10 people and we were seated very quickly. One thing I did notice was that the air conditioner was blasting. It was very cold in the restaurant. Our waitress was nice and she took everyone's food and drink orders right away. I was very hungry and excited for the food. It didn't take long for the food to come out. My plate was on the table for about 5 minutes and my food was completely cold. It's pretty crazy that my food didn't stay hot that long. It was very disappointing because we payed about 12-20 dollars per dish and our food was cold after about 5 minutes of sitting at our table. I suggest turning the A/C down  it shouldn't have to be that cold in the restaurant. I felt like I needed a jacket.
Ron R.,Los Angeles  CA,4,34,47,8/10/2014,1.0,"Just out-right lousy...BJ\'s6000 Sepulveda Blvd.Culver City  CA 90230First  after waiting for nearly 15 minutes for a server and growing impatient  I finally confronted the Manager (a short Latino man whose name was never revealed)  was huddled up with a group of employees toward the front entrance. I point-blank asked him if I could get some service because I felt as though"" I were stranded on a desert island."" He stared at me for a moment seemingly bewildered  and simply said "" Yes.""Adding fuel to the fire and Immediately thereafter  a very tall woman by the name of ""Mecca"" came to our table who only proved to be agitated  passive aggressive  and quite frankly rude and unprofessional. She even sought to challenge my complaint by asking me what I meant by saying I felt like I was stranded on a desert island... Her general deposition was sarcastic  snippy  and dismissive.  Adding insult to injury  the men\'s restroom was permeated with the smell of urine  the Cesar salad was welted  the deep-dish pizza was served lukewarm  as was the hamburger and fries my kids ordered.Needless to say  I will never return to this restaurant again; the entire staff seems grossly incompetent  the food is below par  and the management it self has simply failed the customer and its staff by failing to lead in every sense of the word...  If I could rate this restaurant on a scale of 1-10  I would give them a score of NEGATIVE TEN (-10)."
Bryden P.,Los Angeles  CA,21,43,1,12/23/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Eugene  the manager replied to my review and asked me to message him. I did  and I never got a reply. It is all for show apparently. I am even less impressed with this BJs now.
Lauren W.,Venice  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,3,8/21/2015,1.0,Yikes! This is the first time in 2 years that I've been to this BJ's location. Very big disappointment. It tasted like they zapped every meal in the microwave. My mom's deep dish pizza wasn't warm and it was very salty. My lemon thyme chicken tasted like a frostbit Lean Cuisine frozen meal. We kindly notified the server and he couldn't care less. There's a reason this place only has 2.5 stars... I will not return.
Masanori T.,Santa Monica  CA,46,113,,10/10/2015,1.0,"So this is supposed to be supposed to be a sports bar  right? I come here with my son to watch a premiere college football match up  and they say ""sorry we don\'t have that channel [Big Ten Network]. WTF? I don\'t care what conference it is  or that it was my alam mater playing  if you have two relatively highly RANKED teams playing  any self-respecting sports bar should show that gosh darn game. This is America! (Oh and by the way  wings are just about the only edible item on your pathetic menu - when\'s the last time you took a look at your menu  or cared about the quality of food? 1963?)"
Lauren Milan W.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,32,37,36,5/27/2014,3.0,Came to this location for happy hour...1. Waitress was non-attentive.2. Wait time for 2 appetizers was completely ridiculous.3. Food finally came & was mediocre at best.The only positive thing I have to say about this experience is that the beer selections from the happy hour menu are pretty tasty. The 3 stars are strictly for the drinks.
Justine A.,Wichita  KS,32,149,13,10/25/2014,1.0,Service was ridiculous. Our server disappeared after taking our drink order. She didn't come back until she dropped off the check. She had 5 other tables besides mine which would explain why. But she completely forgot my table and what we ordered. She over charged us for meals we didn't order. No one at my table ordered a small pepperoni pizza or added avocado to their burgers..but somehow it appeared on our bill. When I told our server   she assumed that I had the pizza! I said no? I had a Caesar salad. She was completely confused. Food was good. But here's a tip: servers should only take certain amount of tables that they can handled. The one star is for your server and the lack of service my family and I received.
Krissey B.,Inglewood  CA,119,42,2,11/30/2015,5.0,Came here for a night out with my mom and Brittany b(I think that's the waitresses name) was extremely friendly. She completely went out of her way to assist us and kept checking up on us throughout our meal(unlike many other local restaurants). We will definitely be back as this is my new favorite :-)
Guillermo B.,Los Angeles  CA,5,10,,1/14/2016,1.0,"My Main problem was the host and the waitresses were so busy talking about there personal life  that it took a supervisor/MANAGER to walk over and address them telling them that ""I was a VIP"" and to get me a table. After that we were finally in after knowing everyone\'s business and who\'s sleeping with whom. The service was OK the waitress brought out my App and main course at the same time which the soup was cold and my fish and chips had no flavor. My daughter had the pepperoni pizza she told me she didn\'t like the cheese ""what kid doesn\'t like cheese"" but she was right it did taste funny."
Amelia G.,Hawthorne  CA,1,6,4,12/12/2015,4.0,I came last night for a girls night out. The place was packed with people and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Don't understand why some people were complaining? The place was clean and the service was great. The waiter that we had was great. Don't remember his name but he had a nice Irish accent and also had a gold star on his collar and asked him what was that on his shirt. He said he received it for great customer service. And he was very polite and gave an excellent service with us too. I've been to other BJs b4 but this one was the best to come too. So would recommend the beer  the food and the great service
Charlene B.,Los Angeles  CA,3,3,,7/1/2015,5.0,I liked my waiter Brian. After he gave me my food I watched him from across the room. He was looking @ my table. He looking 2 c what was missing. He came back 2 the table with it b4 my friend had a chance 2 ask. He did his job even after 2 make sure we the customer was happy. So I give him my 5 star rating
James R.,Inglewood  CA,73,16,370,11/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I've been here many times before so I am used to the BJ's experience. We celebrated my son's birthday and had a rather large party. The servers were great and even the manager assisted several times throughout the night. The food was great and I always enjoy coming here to eat my favorite comfort foods.
Darlene R.,Los Angeles  CA,5,3,3,11/18/2015,1.0,"Worst customer service ... Got changed twice and only thing they said ""sorry there only one manger in charge""... They never find the problem ."
Candi R.,Chicago  IL,19,10,17,6/27/2014,3.0,One star for the food one star for the price and one star for the locations and cleanliness (sorry they had to share) anyway I took off one star for the waiter and another for the timeless sorry they don't get to share! OK so where do I begin...There is definitely some glitches in there app they encourage u to download and honey it's simply not worth the hassle. The food and price is delicious and makes up for the waiter who forgets ur there and don't provide u with napkins silverware or water but if u don't mind using your fingers being a little parched and waiting awhile u will be just fine lol the waiter was leaving for the day introduced me to the new waitress and asked did I mind giving him his tip and closing out my bill I hadn't even ordered dessert well i guess I didn't need that anyway lol I guess he did save me a few calories lol. (The brightside)
Steve L.,Santa Monica  CA,143,1186,17,11/17/2012,2.0,Definitely wasn't the worst experience  but I can see why there was no wait for getting a table here.... Granted we had the extra need of figuring out what to order with some dietary restrictions. It was nice that they had a booklet that outlines what items are included  but they don't tell you how to avoid them in your food. Simple things like removing the cheese  or switching out buns etc  our server had no idea. Anyway  made our own modifications  hopefully works out ok.Service here wasn't more then mediocre. Ordered a medium pizza  got a small. When I asked about it  the server initially took it back  saying sorry. Instead of asking if I wanted to start with the small  and then have another small added in a few minutes  OR if I wanted to wait for the medium... the server came back with the small and said I could start on that while another would be prepped. I'm sure he was intending on me getting food faster  but just ask... Overall food is pretty good. Don't look at calories here if you feel guilty with what you eat. Everything looked over the top. Tasty  but you may want to go on a run  or at least a walk after the meal.
Kaitlyn W.,Carlsbad  CA,148,69,42,3/23/2015,3.0,This bjs was..........PACKED. granted it was this past Saturday night and we had a party of 12 haha so there was a fat chance of getting us in. The host was pretty nice but seemed very overwhelmed. We put our name in then decided to go to the bar to get a drink. It was just me and my cousin and we sat down at a table that was dirty because it was packed and we asked one of the busboys very politely  to come in clear off the table so we may order. It took about 15 minutes for a busboy to come back to clean off the table. It was another 10 minutes before a sever even came over and I understand that it was busy  I'm a server also  but he only had a few tables in the bar area and was completely weeded. When he finally came over we ordered 2 berry burst ciders and asked for the check to come with the drinks. He looked at me like I had just offereded him then made a comment that made me feel bad that we weren't staying longer. But we sat and waited for our drinks then sat some more  then sat for a total of 15 minutes to wait for her to stupid beers that take about 30 seconds each to pour in it took 15 minutes. We downed our beers got up and left.Being busy is one thing but providing crappy service when you are busy is another. I will never come back here on a weekend  that's for sure haha.
Amit L.,Los Angeles  CA,129,183,49,1/13/2013,5.0,Since it's located beside a mall  I figured it would be packed. My party and I had to wait 15 minutes before a table opened up for us. The young lady who escorted us to our table was polite. Our waitress was very friendly  hilarious  and attentive. She knew what we needed before we thought of it. Her focus was on putting a smile on our faces and producing a beautiful dining experience for our enjoyment.Two strong rounds of Buttery Nipples before our appetizers gave me a nice little buzz for food. lol! The Albacore Pok on wonton crisps were out of this world! The stuffed mushrooms were loaded with cheese and seasoned bread crumbs. The calamari was super crispy and hot out of the fryer. The potato skins were light and crisp as well. The Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger was huge. I thought the patty was a little dry  but didn't mind that at all. The garlic aioli went very well with the burger. It was served up with potato wedges...Mmm Mmm Delicious! The menu is a bit pricey but well worth it for an auspicious occasion.I loved the ambiance. All the football games were on all the flat panel tv screens at very corner of restaurant. Loved the bar set up...looked very elegant. Inside the restaurant was clean and the restroom was clean as well. Parking is a bit of a hassle to find on your own in the parking structure but feel free to valet outside in front of the restaurant. 5 stars all around. :)
Lisa W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,6,8/21/2015,1.0,Alas  what happened  BJs? Used to look forward to your deep dish pizza  but tonite you served me a lukewarm  salty  mushy microwave poor excuse for deep dish. And when I kindly shared the truth with my server (who asked) he said nothing. If he didn't even care  why ask. Next time  food court
Rachelle J.,Inglewood  CA,3,9,3,11/7/2015,1.0,Slow!! I always avoid this place but the family wanted to come. Of course they never disappoint with the slow service and cold food. Should have done the endless pasta at Olive Garden.
Di P.,Oakland  CA,92,46,,6/6/2016,3.0,The food I ordered was bland and overpriced (a bowl of chili and a small salad with mushrooms and asparagus pieces) but our waiter Jose S was phenomenal. He was able to remember everyone's order without taking anything down and some of us had had special requests. He was also fast and very friendly.
Stella Y.,Los Angeles  CA,805,681,512,10/29/2012,2.0,I bragged and bragged about coming to BJs because I loved it so much. I've always given 5 stars to the one's I've gone to. Unfortunately  I was thoroughly disappointed. 3 of us went at 5:30PM on a Sunday night which was already pretty crowded. We got a booth on the side with very dim lighting. I understand it was busy but our waitress took forever to help us the whole time.I got the jalapeno burger and expected some cheesy  crunchy and spicy goodness. The burger was bland and I could barely find the jalapenos through the 1 slice of cheese. I think it was the bun that made the burger look big. The potato wedges were pretty good and soft but were not well seasoned like they mentioned. My friend got the BJs favorite pizza and claimed it too salty. I don't know what it was about this location but I'm still optimistic that it can bounce back and give me the burst of flavor I'm looking for.
Tony R.,Los Angeles  CA,1,21,2,7/16/2014,5.0,I really enjoyed this place! The food was delicious. The beer selection was really good.  I was VERY impressed with Alejandro! He took such good care of us. Service means a great deal to me and he really was excellent. He reminded me of what good service looks like. He is such an asset to the establishment. His meticulous care really made the evening special!  Even though the place was very busy  our food came quickly.   I highly recommend this place!
Joelle B.,Granada Hills  Los Angeles  CA,3,1,3,5/10/2015,5.0,I get is Mothers's Day and it was very crowded but they did an amazing job of sitting us very quickly. I will definitely go to this one again. Just to see Jake. Jake is the BEST waiter there!! Whenever you go ask for Jake's section. He is super sweet and knows his customer service. Great experience.
Jennifer M.,Los Angeles  CA,37,8,4,5/10/2015,1.0,"I had the worst experience. The waiter was rude. My food came out cold 3 different times. My daughter meal did not come with the fries and when we brought it up to the waiter his response was ""I came by several times and asked you if everything was ok"" he made it seem like it was our fault that they forgot our fries. I talked to the manager and she simply responded that she was going to talk to the kitchen. No apologizes or anything. This place is horrible with horrible service and management."
Denise P.,Cerritos  CA,37,14,42,2/25/2015,4.0,Having a great experience here celebrating my nephew play. The service great our waitress is great her name was Christina.  The manager needs a little help as a manager she will not work with us Kim brown I hope corporate see this. She would not give us a deal because we was a big party :(
Farah R.,Lawndale  CA,15,71,9,5/18/2014,2.0,"Went into bjs last night with a few friends. We started out as just 5 of us at 7:30pm and by 08:30  the rest of our party joined us (we were a total of 12 people). While waiting for everyone else  we sat at one of the bar tables.After a few minutes  the waiter strolled over  no smile  no introduction  no basic ""Good evening  how are you tonight"" banter... just down to the basic  ""What can I get you guys?"" He looked like he was having a bad day and if anyone was to ask for too much  he was gonna tell them where to go. Bearing that in mind  we ordered. I got a water to start and my hubby got a black and coke. Please tell me why it took 10 minutes for me to get my water? It came after my husband got his black and coke. Last I checked  they don\'t actually have to assemble the water like an alcoholic beverage....Now comes the food. We ordered their deep dish pizza  half cheese and half pepperoni. We requested no tomatoes on the cheese portion. It came with tomatoes. We scraped them off. The pizza itself was not crunchy and not very flavorful either. It was a bit soggy on the crust and tasted a bit old. It was also medium warm when we receivedIt  not piping hot like it had just come out of the oven. We had a little better service when we moved to a bigger table  but we had already eaten by then. If you don\'t want to be at work  then don\'t come in cause the attitude really is not necessary. Plus you sure as hell ain\'t gonna get a great tip. Needless to say  I won\'t be returning to this BJ\'s any time soon."
Brian M.,Santa Monica  CA,21,57,99,3/30/2014,1.0,"First off  horrible service! They always seem to take care of large parties first. I remember calling in to reserve a table for a party of three. The woman said no  we don\'t do reservations. How do you serve large parties if you don\'t take reservations?? The hostess area needs a change. When it came time to order your food it sucked. I got my appetizers first before my drinks. Even then  all drinks weren\'t served at the same time. On many occasions  it took about 20 minutes just to receive my drinks. I also felt mistreated. Just thinking of the demographics (people) I felt like the African Americans were getting far more better treatment than I did. The noise level in this place is loud and most ""fellow"" patrons are obnoxious and annoying. Don\'t go to this place. Visit another BJ\'s  like Westwood location."
Francisco B.,Crenshaw  Los Angeles  CA,7,3,,10/26/2014,1.0,Brought my family to have lunch only to be greeted by staff that felt that my baby's stroller is a big inconvenience to them. We didn't feel welcomed at all  this is not the first time we visit this restaurant  in fact  I've been a customer since they opened. The staff made me break down my baby's stroller and stuffed it in a corner  when we got to the table the high chair was very dirty and sticky. I asked the hostess to clean it and she only grabbed a few napkins and smeared it more. At this point I had enough and we left. We went to Olive Garden across the way here where they are baby friendly. Management need to work on figuring out where to park strollers since I see lots of families come here to dine. Maybe park them in the big patio that they have available??
Christa F.,Redondo Beach  CA,32,23,3,9/27/2014,3.0,The service here was decent  but I was surprised it wasn't more baby-friendly  especially since it's attached to the mall. It is kid-friendly  though. They had a plastic cup  crayons and placemat for a kid. They have booster seats and high chairs  but they make you fold up your stroller and leave it in the main lobby area. It was a bit awkward  since I'm guessing a lot of people go to the restaurant with strollers. I'm glad I had a friend to hold my baby while I dealt with this inconvenience. Also  the high chairs are very short and the booster seat was sticky.The food was ok  but nothing special. The wait staff was nice  so that's good!
Scott H.,Los Angeles  CA,10,36,9,7/29/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,BJs is a great place to go. They offer the highest quality food  and the place has a nice feel to it.My only complaint is twice now they either forgot the appetizer or brought salad and main course at the same time.Manager  who I did not ask for came over  and he blamed technology. He should be fired as he is an idiot.Its worth going to  Just order your appetizers first  than when you get them  order your main course.Thanks for reading!!!
Patricia W.,Los Angeles  CA,6,9,5,11/8/2015,4.0,"Popped in on a Thursday evening  close to 6:00. Was seated promptly - party of 2. Not being too hungry  we decided on soup and flat bread. We ordered as soon as our waiter came.  We ate our meal and waited more than 15min for our waitress to return - she never returned. I asked for a manager and Caleb helped us out. While waiting  our waitress finally appeared  and asked us if there was something we needed! Lol  ""How does this restaurant work?"" Do we not eat and pay? Luckily Mgr Caleb witnessed the conversation. Our bill was reduced by 15%. I just wanted to receive basic  hospitality service.   This is only my 2nd visit to BJ\'s. I will say the restaurant was busy  the bar area was full also.  Thank you  Caleb. Do not give up on this restaurant. We need eateries that offer more than high cholesterol  low substance meals in the vicinity."
Chris M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,2,6/22/2015,3.0,Holy crap they took away the porkchops Best thing on the menu and they got rid of it what were they thinking maybe I'll show up again if they bring back the porkchops
Gina M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,4,6/25/2016,1.0,So disappointed with the quality of the food..i ordered chicken lettuce wrap not happy and check the lettuce before eating.
John B.,Los Angeles  CA,9,16,,11/5/2015,1.0,Went to eat with family  got seated. Waited 20 mins and no one and I mean no one bothered to come to our table. The waitress' came by 10 times had eye contact and yet not one wanted to wait on us. I always loved the food and the drinks here  but I will never go back to it again!!!!!
Tyler S.,Santa Monica  CA,33,20,2,1/3/2015,1.0,WORST. PIZZA. EVER! They claim to have deep dish pizza - it is not. It is as thick as a couple of pancakes. Save your money and time; order dominos. Deep dish pizza comes in a two or 3 in deep pan! This is about half an inch!
Jennifer I.,Lake Balboa  Los Angeles  CA,83,49,230,4/11/2016,4.0,I have always liked to go to BJ's but unfortunately my boyfriend does not so we rarely ever go there. On yelp I saw they are $10 off a $35 food purchase so we ordered jambalaya and the (blackened shrimp) Santa Fe salad to go. When I called to place the order the girl on the phone wasn't very helpful and seemed irritated that I mentioned this to Shaw. First she tried to tell me it was expired and then she said I can only use it if I was a rewards member  neither of those were true. When I came to pick up the food she made me fill out the rewards membership  which I didn't mind to do but she made it seem like I had to do it for the discount  which again was not true. I got back to the house and we didn't get any utensils  the jambalaya looked like a child size portion and my salad was ALL lettuce & missing onion strings. Some of this isn't really that big of a deal but it's a combination of it all that was irritating. I decided to call Felix the manager at BJ's a few days later and nicely explained to him the experience I had. He was nice enough to comp us a free lunch. I was appreciative of his high-level customer service skills and that I didn't have to be a b*tch to get compensation. Looking forward to eating there again soon.
Danni M.,Irvine  CA,69,33,28,6/28/2014,1.0,Not a good experience and a waste of time. Waited over an hour for our pizza. Ordered the calamari and it fell short of expectations. Not crispy. The pieces were huge and there was no flavor. Won't be coming back. The waiters couldn't even find the manager... Don't get the deep dish pizza. If you've ever had real deep dish  you'll be quite disappointed.
C C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,1,2/15/2015,1.0,Worst service ever tonight at BJ's. First  there were open seats and unclean tables. Yet  I was told there was a 30 minutes wait. Then  my waiter stated he was taking a break and passed us off to a waitress who was unresponsive and untimely. Service was slow and incorrect. I've eaten here several times and have never complained about service before. Management seemed as equally unresponsive and as baffled as I was about our servers inability to service our table. I'm disappointed to say the least. I was so affected  I was unable to complete my meal. The kicker was that tables surrounding ours were as disappointed. I'll have to rethink my dining experience here in the future.
Tara B.,Los Angeles  CA,24,8,3,5/26/2014,1.0,If you ever eat here  PAY WITH CASH!!They charged me three times for three different amounts and claimed that they have no recollection of doing so. After numerous phone calls with the manager Felix  I had to go ahead and call my credit card company and report fraud. This not only happened to me  but two of my friends as well. All I can advise is that if you do eat here make sure to monitor your bank account. They definitely have some shady workers here!
Breezy Z.,San Diego  CA,0,55,,5/17/2016,5.0,Kandace was amazing--she went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and that I was happy with my meal. She really deserves some recognition!
mona f.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,10,,12/15/2015,5.0,Go here once a week and the food is consistently good  service is friendly and prompt. Prices are also reasonable. Great place to sit at the bar and watch a game at your lunch hour.
Tricia T.,Lawndale  CA,0,22,52,9/1/2015,3.0,Been coming here for several years now so I figure I should leave a review. I definitely feel like the dinner service is more attentive than the lunch service. For some reason  the off days just seem like they're when I come in for lunch versus dinner. The food is always good  so no problem there. But service is sometimes hit or miss. Servers kinda seem like they have too much to do. I've been in the F&B business since I started working my first job so I know sometimes positions withstand too much for what it's worth. But I don't think it justifies the attitude to the guests. Oh well. I'll still come for the food.
Ed A.,Riverside  CA,10,112,73,8/28/2015,2.0,Well  I would have to say I experienced my first bad visit at BJ's. Getting seated wasn't bad but it took 20mins before anyone came by. We were going to order appetizers but by now we figured we would just order. The pizza was a bit under cooked and there was no offer of grated cheese or peppers. To make a long story short  we won't be back to this particular location.
Chioma A.,Los Angeles  CA,3,21,6,9/7/2014,4.0,I visit this BJ's very often. Usually on a Friday or Saturday night after 8pm. My boyfriend and I pretty much order the same things lately.Atlantic salmon (blackened)  served with rice and steamed vegetables. Dessert is always a mini chocolate chip pizookie. Bj's blackened salmon is delicious to me. Sometimes I get it over a ceasar salad. I call ahead for a table these days. It helps reduce the wait time. The staff can leave much to be desired. The servers can be a hit or miss (same with most big franchise establishments).I enjoy the place overall.
Vichea C.,Lomita  CA,17,126,82,8/1/2015,4.0,The pazookie is by far the best dessert here. Can't let it sit for too long  otherwise it will harden. Macadamia nut with white chocolate is served warm and crunchy. Strawberry beignet was okay  was expecting it to be better.
Stephanie L.,Santa Monica  CA,257,671,6,1/14/2013,4.0,PIZOOOOOOKIE!Pretty much the only reason I come here. Over-sized freshly baked warm chocolate chip cookie pie thingy topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream -- SO GOOD. If you've never tried it  you absolutely MUST.That is all.
Mizraim A.,Inglewood  CA,1,22,5,9/29/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Came here again after a really bad experience   in the past decided to give it a second shot   why not   but really really disappointed with their service our waiter took forever to bring out the food and they forgot about my fries   not only they brought them after 45 minutes but the charged for them   im not exaggerating but i wish upper management starts to do something about this or else they will lose more customers ... Never coming back again well at least for a good while . Ps   ( some customers left without paying   which i think is wrong but due to their slow and bad customer service is bound to happen )
Niks O.,Los Angeles  CA,646,255,218,6/25/2014,3.0,Came on a Sunday night just for Pizookie's with a couple friends. Was feeling a little under the weather otherwise I would have ordered my normal Jerry Burst. Nothing spectacular.. Seated ourselves quickly in the bar.. Knew what we wanted.. Came out in a timely manner. There's a BJ's closer to where I live but this one is closer to my gf's place so I don't mind coming here too. Will probably come again.
Jackie F.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,2,2/25/2015,1.0,Love the environment but we sat for 56 minutes waiting for our order tonight. If you are hungry and don't have a few hours on your hands  do not come here. It was ridiculous and we were never told that the kitchen was slow or apologized to for the wait. It wasn't even like we had complex orders. We were then apologized to and they said they would have it right up. 20 minutes past and so we left.
Alexis B.,Cerritos  CA,49,58,376,6/1/2015,2.0,My boyfriend lives in the area so we end up coming to this BJs location just because it's the only one in the vicinity but our experiences are always either hit or way bad miss.  Maybe part of the problem on this visit was that we came on a Saturday night so it was obviously really busy. The waiting to get seated part wasn't the problem. We got seated at a single's booth which was great but the table that we sat at had a drop of water on the table which I noticed when I sat down but just thought 'oh yeah of course they wipe down the tables between customers' but as I was going over the menu I felt a drop of water on my arm. I wasn't sure what was happening but ignored it until a few minutes later my boyfriend noticed another drop of water hit our table. We were seated right under the air conditioning pipes (not the actual opening) and figured the coolant was leaking through somehow. I understood the restaurant was busy and the water only dropped every 15 minutes so I resolved to just move my plate over if my food came. Out of courtesy we alerted our server (I think his name was Mike) and he said he would figure out what was going on upstairs at Old Navy (-_-) but he never came back and didn't really mention it again. He was an ok server but seemed very distracted while he was with us--like he was always trying to move on to the next thing. I didn't really feel like he cared about our dining experience but it was busy so I tried not to care. But when our food finally came out and he set my boyfriend's burger down and my salmon quinoa bowl and walked away I was a little miffed since we didn't have silverware. I started just picking out the asparagus with my fingers and eating them until he managed to bring some over (we had to ask as he was zooming past our table). At this point I was annoyed but still willing to give this location the benefit of the doubt but when I rolled out my silverware from the napkins and saw some dried piece of white food stuck to the fork I was pretty much done. The rest of the meal proceeded painfully slow and all we wanted to do was get out. The food was sub-par  the french fries were the only saving grace (which had to come out separately than the burger but at least they were hot). As far as the new salmon quinoa bowl went  I wish I had stuck with my usual cherry chipotle salmon. We were so done with BJs that we didn't even order a pizzookie which is usually the primary reason we go there. We are generally a big fan and supporter of BJs. There's one in my town that we haven't had problems with but this one has been a bit of a struggle.
Kiani J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,11/26/2015,1.0,I do not recommend anybody EVER coming to this location. The staff did not seem to take their job serious  poor service  had to ask for table to be cleared  and for refills on drinks. Spoke with manager Ryan who lacked managerial skills .
Zandra E.,Dallas  TX,663,481,78,4/25/2012,3.0,Maybe even a 3.5. Okay  so last night my friends wanted to meet up after class and BJ's was chosen because it was close to school  served alcohol and had plenty of food for us to choose from. I've been to BJ's in Dallas and had a fun experience so I was down. So I head up there and OMG  parking was a complete pain the ass! I mean  c'mon  it is in a mall structure?! Parking should not be such an issue! After driving around for forever in a day  I decided to valet instead of burning gas which was $7 (not including tip). I went into BJ's and it was pretty much like every other BJ's I've been to. Nothing special  but it was crowded and clean. I found my friends and the waitress was super nice and took our orders quickly. Let me just say though  I was not too happy that the bartender pretended to know how to make a chocolate martini and sent me this white crap in a martini glass with a squiggle of chocolate on top that tasted like MILK. Mama wasn't happy at all. I sent that shit back with a quickness and ordered a White Russian instead and they did manage to get that one right (and it was strong). What wasn't right was paying $8 for such a basic drink at a place called BJ's. The food was typical BJ's food. Pretty good. Everyone was ordering small bites so we could try each other's food. The avocado wraps are awesome and a great vegetarian option. Also  the Capri salad was yummy. Plus  the price point was not bad at all.The great thing I did like was our ability to have a fun  crazy conversation without being interrupted a lot nor being told to quiet down (yes  we were that table). It was awesome. So  for that alone  I have to say I will definitely return with friends.
Big B.,Hollywood  CA,2,37,2,9/13/2014,2.0,Mall food with lacking service and a nice selection of drafts. What more to say other than a few random observations?The front door staff seemed more like a confused circle jerk than a hospitality service. The table service was pleasant enough but rather slow and uneven. Wrong appetizer came out  was sent back  entrees arrived immediately thereafter (delivered by food runner)  correct appetizer eventually arrives. Then for desert  4-ever to clear the table and get the check.This is where you go to work when you can't cut it at Mickey D's.Food was passable but nothing to rave about. And a bit pricey for the teeny portions.Party next to us had a Chihuahua at the table.
La Toya T.,Hawthorne  CA,9,19,,4/2/2016,1.0,"The worse place to go.........Me and my family came to this BJ after leaving a wonderful day at Universal Studios. Mind you I stay near Torrance and NEVER had a issue with the one in Torrance. My party ordered half boneless buffalo wings and the other half plain(fried) as a appetizer. The buffalo wings were cold like the sauce was cold. Our food arrived after. My nephew kids pizza was hard as a brick and my daughter chicken Alfredo was slopped on her plate like whatever. No presentation at all.......my pizza came and it was under cooked. The bottom of the pizza was white....the plain wings I ordered was buffalo and I told the waitress the first time  ""PLAIN"".........she came back with the chicken but more coated and darker. I told her for the third time plain. Maybe I said plain buffalo wings. That may have caused the confusion. My family heard plain........My sister asked to speak with the manager who really doesn\'t present himself as a manager.....more like the bus boy......that moved up and it was his first day or a filler in because the real manager called out. He was unapologetic as a manager shouldn\'t be. I\'m sorry that happened to you......what can I do to make this experience better. NONE of that flowed from his mouth. He brought back the pizza and wings and asked how does it taste and I said it SEEMS cooked and I tasted a bite and it was ok but after eating the slice of pizza......it tasted like a box pizza that still was doughy on top like a box pizza. He walked away........no thought into what discount was going to take place. He then came back as I summoned him and explained that I was disappointed in the service and that the only people in my party that had to wait for their food was my daughter and I. I explained that I don\'t come to this BJ and only came because we were passing this one from a joyous time at Universal Studios. He said ok......I said I normally go to Torrance because I stay out there. He then went to say I stay in Torrance and what part of Torrance do you live. I took that as being sarcastic and told him i stay in Hawthorne.....He then said ok. Unapologetic he was........I asked what type of discount was he going to give us for being inconvenience and he said he is going to pay for the Chicken Alfredo and Pizza. I was ok with that BUT had he been a BETTER manager fill in (I think). I would\'ve probably came back. Not as much but I would\'ve came back.......maybe once to see how the new experience would be. Since that didn\'t happen.......I\'ll use my hard earned money elsewhere. One more thing.......don\'t let the curly out of whack hair full you because IM SURE my pay check will make your eye BUCK Mr. Manager!!!!!! One more thing to add......the plates that they brought for the appetizers were dirty. Chopped green onions and etc......Another thing......I get it was a Friday night and it was busy......that\'s when your servers give their A game to friendliness and hot GREAT FOOD!!!!!!"
Tessani T.,Long Beach  CA,10,22,,9/9/2015,5.0,Currently still in the restaurant. Jake our server is giving us really good service. He is very helpful  accurate  and its great that he has a great smile with a winning personality and he was kind enough to adjust the cool air flow around us. I'd say ask to be served by Jake every single time I come in. I will visit this restaurant again.
Rashida C.,Los Angeles  CA,235,21,9,3/7/2014,5.0,I love it here.. Great food... Good service... And I can go shopping afterward because it's apart of the Fox hills Mall
Jamila H.,Venice  CA,1,14,7,10/5/2014,4.0,All the football games are on  it's happy hour slash brunch  and our server was a total sweetheart. Happy Sunday!
Maribel G.,Los Angeles  CA,32,20,5,3/17/2015,4.0,Had dinner with the husband around midnight still open.. Our waiter was good check in with us every 10 min that was nice not everyone does that.. The food was good love the sirloan the meat was nice and juicy..
Chelsea R.,Rialto  CA,55,1,,4/21/2016,1.0,We go to BJ's all the time on different occasions and have always had great service and never had any issuses but tonight was horrible. We came for my friend's birthday dinner and there was a large party and that fine as everyone started to leave here and there her uncle who is mentally disabled just stood against the pillar next to our table and watched the game as the rest of us sat there talking. The Manager Felix processed to walk up to her uncle and ask him questions and he got nervous and ran to the patio section of the restaurant. Felix then tried to run after him and we all told him to leave him alone and sent his sister after him to calm him down. There were 5 of us all letting him know that we had it under control and he would make it worse. Felix then said Okay but went around to a different door to enter the patio where they were. The Uncle came back to us while his sister was trying to tell the manager to leave him and explain his condition then another manager processed to our table. He asked us if he was with us and we all told him (6 adults) that he was with us and that he has a mental health issue and we are taking care of it and that strangers would make the situation worse. By this time the uncle had gone back into the patio area and the new manager then went out there to check it out. 1) He was not a danger to anyone. 2)He had been there with us over 2 hours quietly eating his food and when he was done he stood there quietly and watched tv. 3) It was embarrassing for our family for the manager to make a bigger stink about it then needed. Have they not dealt with someone with issuses or what? He had been there with us since we got there and we spent 300+ dollars on our bill and for us to walk out unhappy and embarrassed is ridiculous. 4) Your staff especially the manager should know how to deal with situations like these. I could understand if it was someone that randomly walked in but He had been there and we confirmed that he was with us.
Travis M.,Kansas City  MO,6,16,2,3/31/2015,1.0,The food was below average and the drinks were very poor quality. 8 people in our group and everyone's shared the same experience. Save the trip and go somewhere else.
Char J.,Long Beach  CA,6,67,2,3/19/2014,3.0,The floors are an ass buster waiting to happen. I have resulted to considering my shoe selection when we plan to eat here. If you are wearing heels  proceed with caution. I have come here a couple of times with friends and family and they do alright. I like that it's close to the freeway. The food is okay  the drinks are okay and the service is decent. I'm just in the middle on this one. Nicked a star because of the slippery ass floors.
Stephanie R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,2/7/2016,1.0,Went to bjs today because i was hungry. They took us to our table and the waitress did not help us at all. 20 minutes passed by. Ive noticed her looking at us and walking away. I understand its busy but at least let me know you'll be with us in a second. I sat in the right section once you come in the door. That bimbo could of cracked a smile like she meant it. Ive been coming to bjs for so many years and was excited when they opened one near my home but after this experience Im not sure i would come back. The manager should really train there employees well.
Eric F.,San Leandro  CA,735,2518,266,2/9/2014,3.0,All the usual offerings one would expect with any BJ's. I can at least speak for the quality of the staff at the bar as they did a great job taking care of my drinks. I don't know about the servers for the tables  but one can at least rest assured the bar experience will be fine.
Tiffany M.,Inglewood  CA,59,4,28,7/28/2014,4.0,I am so grateful for Nick The Bartender!!!! He made me the best Strawberry Martini ever!!!! The Jambalya was bomb!!!!! Thanks BJ's!!!!
Temenah C.,Anaheim  CA,389,1027,3,10/23/2012,3.0,We came here after a wedding because our hotel was literally right next door. I used to love BJ's. I thought the pizza was amazing  the beer was pretty good  and don't even get me started on the awesomeness of the pizookie. No one does a pizookie like BJ's. I think things went a little south for me because competition just got a little too stiff. All of a sudden there were billions of other places that had awesome pizza and great  not just good  beer. So  I have to admit  it's been awhile since I've ventured into a BJ's.I was quite pleased on my recent visit. Although we just ordered drinks  I was shocked and happy to see their good selection of craft beers. They have Bear Republic  Green Flash  and Stone to name a fiew. They even had a good lineup of Belgians (Hoegaarden  Duvel  etc). Knowing that  I might have been too hard on this old standby. I might have to try this place out all over again.
Beatrix K.,Culver City  CA,38,10,5,5/5/2014,1.0,Worst service ever  will never go back. I asked the manager if this was how his waiters usually behaved  and he paused and said  Yes. I couldn't believe it  my friends and I  immediately burst into laughter. The only pro  is that the manager comp'd our entrees. Language barrier or honest answer?
Ashley P.,Los Angeles  CA,4,2,,4/1/2015,1.0,Very slow service. Arrived at 8:00 pm  seated at 8:15  didn't get food until 9:40 pm  which was cold and not made to order.
Amora G.,Harbor Gateway  Los Angeles  CA,493,15,5,6/8/2014,5.0,This place is great so get here before the rush  but still 100% worth the short wait. The mall being right here is a huge plus. Today was my first time coming since they started brunch. I'm not usually fond of Bloody Marys but this was heavenly! The kick and fresh garden pepper garnish yet another plus. My friend got the Jeremiah Red.I ordered from the brunch menu and the service was great from beginning to end. Waitress (cant remember her name but its similar to Judy/Jedi) was kind  quick and proactive- plus  plus  plus.I had an issue with my food being over done  and without hesitation  the big boss  Marcos (not sure if he's the Manager  Chef  Franchise owner  etc. but he came out in a chefs jacket and took PRIDE in fixing the situation to my liking and even offered us a free dessert even though he didn't have to! I must note that being nice and respecting others even when my food isnt up to par will 9 times out of 10 get the problem fixed for you. Something to think about.Thanks BJs... I'll be coming back :)Overall  I
Michael C.,Castaic  CA,348,66,2,6/23/2015,1.0,Didn't really have a good experience here. As soon as I got here we were put on the list only to be forgotten about as we waited and saw people who came be seated right away. We talked to the guy up front and he has seated us three minutes later and we waited a total 20 minutes. The place we were sat at was extremely cold to the point I was grabbing my arms. The food was pretty good although I think the burger was a bit small. As fast as the waiter had delivered our food  the food tasted like it was sitting for a while as if someone else had ordered it thirty minutes before and left and it was given to us. It tasted good but it was not really fresh out the oven in terms of how hot the food was. We were also given a empty ketchup bottle by our waiter  come on now! Hopefully my next visit will be better.
Amit O.,Los Angeles  CA,2,58,4,3/15/2015,1.0,Worst service ever. Had to wait at the reception to get seated while the receptionist was busy talking to the servers. That's not it  had to wait another 15 minutes for someone to ask for water and another 30 minutes to finally get a drink. The service was horrible. Would not recommend this place to anyone
Claudia P.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,57,17,10,6/21/2014,4.0,We enjoy coming here. There is normally a long wait but we know this ahead so it doesn't bother us to much. The service is good most of the time. We like the food and the various selection of beers. Of course my kids love the Pazooki's
Emily S.,Dayton  OH,1852,2249,4775,10/28/2009,3.0,Second or third time going to a BJ's it was not that bad. The restaurant was pretty busy for a late sunday afternoon. They only make reservations for parties of 10 or more. If you have less than that  you may call 30 mins ahead of time to get on the waitlist.I ordered the California Club Flatbread Pizza. It came with grilled chicken  crisp Applewood smoked bacon  tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Our table also had the Avocado Egg Rolls  Chicken Lettuce Wraps  and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. My flatbread pizza was pretty good. I liked it.. but there was A lot. I gave away four slices. I looked at the menu later. Each slice was 100 or so calories! I think I may have eaten 5 or 6 slices. These were small 1.5 inch slices though... not regular sized pizza slices.The Avocado Egg rolls were okay. A little spicy. I wouldn't get it again. The Spinach Artichoke Dip was average. It tasted like any other dip. It was good.. but it was also good in a bad way. The Chicken Lettuce wraps were okay.
Rob P.,San Diego  CA,1767,2071,822,1/22/2012,4.0,I really  really wanted to hate on BJ's when my friends said that we should meet there. One of them had never been  so she wanted to give it a try. I hate chains  but BJ's not the worst chain (I think that's TGI Friday's)  so I did it.Had a chopped chicken salad that was really  really good. Also had some of my friend's avocado eggrolls  which were just OK but were made awesome with the dipping sauce. Kind of weird that my friend couldn't get a Red Bull & vodka (they don't carry Red Bull). Ahhh chains.Remembered I had a free pazookie coupon in my car and we just devoured that delicious thing. Ugh  left there so full.No  you're right  none of us got the pizza. Hmm.
Elsy Q.,Los Angeles  CA,44,28,2,3/20/2015,2.0,The pizza is luke warm as usual. The sevice is mediocre  we didnt get plates for the pizza. The food and the price big thumbs down
Steve C.,Torrance  CA,39,2,,7/31/2015,1.0,Come here if you like terrible service and food: missing items from your order  waiting 45 minutes for your food  and being ignored by the waiters. I keep coming back because i love disappointment.
Lauren O.,San Fernando Valley  CA,166,558,76,2/23/2012,2.0,Meh.... I've been to the location of BJ's in Westwood also and to me the food was about the same--nothing to write home about. I have come to the conclusion that the best thing is their pizzookie which is a freshly baked cookie with ice cream. On the positive side  the service was spot on tonight  so we were appreciative of that. Meh  I will pass on this place next time
S C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,101,35,3/6/2015,3.0,the food.... A+++the service F-----service is so bad sometimes.. I keep coming back because the food is delicious but every time  they never fail to make something go wrong. This location is convenient for me so I keep coming.Definitely need some improvements though.
Jen W.,Los Angeles  CA,6,25,17,5/23/2014,4.0,Came for lunch. Can't beat all you can eat soup and salad for under $8. Plus with all the choices you can't go wrong. Service was good today too!Come for the lunch specials!!!
Jeanette J.,Los Angeles  CA,12,39,47,2/15/2015,1.0,Horrible service and follow up by manager who had an attitude. Not even worth one star tonight. Horrific dining experience.
Danielle M.,Los Angeles  CA,694,647,395,4/17/2014,4.0,Service is fast and friendly for lunch. You can normally get in and out of here in less than an hour. The lunch specials are great. It's nice to have a small individual pizza and salad. Both were really good. I still miss the pans the pizza comes in though. They get so soggy so quick.
Armida L.,Los Angeles  CA,34,8,2,8/19/2015,5.0,We just had a 35 office party there and the staff and managers and food was great!!! Thank you BJs for having the food ready and hot on time!!!
Leidy S.,Los Angeles  CA,8,96,1,2/14/2015,5.0,I was a bit hesitant to dine here since the reviews are not that good  but we still decided to eat dinner here the other night. We ordered appetizers as our food of choice  we got the wings  santa fe rolls  carnitas fries and sliders with fries. Our waiter Mike was attentive and would check on us even though it was busy. Every thing we ordered was delicious even though i would have liked my wings to be coated in the sauce not just drizzled. I was hoping i would have had room to try a pizookie but I couldnt fit anything else in my belly!!!! Maybe next time.
Miguel A.,Santa Monica  CA,14,62,117,2/7/2015,5.0,Great beer selection. Great food selection. Oh and did I mention the free wifi. I recommend the great white pizza and a nutty brunette beer for those over 21 year of age.
Eddie O.,Los Angeles  CA,22,4,2,3/27/2016,5.0,I decided to come in today on a holiday  wasn't sure if they would be open since the mall is close. But to my luck they were. We waited 15 minutes to get seated. It wasn't a big deal since they were busy. We got our drinks  our food and everything was good. Unfortunately half way thru my cadillac margarita I notice that there was lipstick in the rim of the glass. I was a bit disgusted so I ask for the manager. Luis came over I explain our dilemma. He was really apologetic he offer a new drink but I just wasn't feeling it. He offer other drinks from the bar that sounded good but after the lipstick I didn't want any. He was so friendly he talk us into a pissukey(I think that's how you spell it).. the caramel one was really good I think I'm hook on it. Luis kept checking on us to make sure everything was good til the moment we left. Luis the manager and Teresa the server were great. Thanks for the great experience even after a bump in it... see you next time Teresa good luck...
Mitchell F.,Woodland Hills  CA,2,33,2,7/15/2015,5.0,They made us wait 20-30 min  but whatever  it was worth the wait . It was my first time eating here  my bf decided to bring me here   was a bit worried about the food  ordered a blt sandwich it was the shit lol also for my princess we did a deep dished pepperoni pizza it was good as well my princess didn't want to leave they gave her a coloring menu while we waited for the food  it took a while for the food but it was good most def. Will be back  a bit too crouded for my taste but worth it for the food  every one was pretty nice as well just sucked having to wait so long not a fan of the door  how it rolls in like old school hotel lol
Douglas M.,Los Angeles  CA,115,151,101,9/4/2013,2.0,The worst BJ's I have been to. What do I mean by worst? Take your pick! Terrible food  service  experience and crowd. I would come back for happy hour only.
Charles C.,Los Angeles  CA,57,47,,5/7/2014,3.0,This was our first visit to this BJ's although my family has eaten there before in a different city. On this occasion  service from our waitress wasn't the best as we had to wait close to an hour to get served. (Tick  tock.....) Now I'll slide and recognize because it was Sunday  business might be busier than usual  but almost an hour wait? Not cool. When it came time for our orders  our waitress who apparently felt stressed the whole time she approached our table  almost missed a order request from one member of our party and when it came time for our food to be served  another member was given a different meal than what they had selected. So on the service side  it could have been better. A whole lot better.Of course  that's not to take away the quality food BJ serves. It was lunchtime so I had a nice sampling of one of their sandwiches. Their burgers are pretty awesome too  if your stomach can hold out after a long wait. They have an outstanding menu and even though our visit wasn't so great  the meals we ate definitely deserve an A+ each and every time. What I also like about this particular location is that while it's close to the mall  parking wasn't that bad and once you get inside  they have huge screens all around. Just enough to have an excuse for a night out with the guys.So while the menu and dishes were top notch  I hope service definitely improves or it'll be hard to find reasons to show up  and our family loves this place too. I hope on our next visit  we'll have a different result.
Kieanitria P.,Inglewood  CA,39,28,2,2/17/2015,2.0,BJ's needs to work on their customer service. I placed a catering order (for 25 ppl) the morning of the event. Placing the order over the phone was easy and I appreciated the fact that I was told that the sides were small. I arrived 15 minutes after my scheduled p/u time. The greeters at the front were awful. And one kept interrupting the guy that was gathering and packing my order. It seemed to be a disorganized mess. Phones were ringing  they were taking walk in orders in spite of me waiting for my pre order. The manager did come out to help pack my order and help me to the car. While I'm not a fan of chain restaurant food  party goers did like the food  hence the two stars.
Rochelle D.,Bellflower  CA,65,12,,6/7/2015,1.0,This was the worse experience I've had at BJ. The General Manager Eugene Ochoa wasn't good either and our Waitress Briana had the worse attitude and she needs to be fired on the spot. It was my sisters birthday get together and everything from the start was. We had a party of 15 and only one person helped us my husband and mother didn't get their food in time so they canceled their orders. I had to give them a 1 star but if I could I would have given them nothing
Justin H.,Los Angeles  CA,56,29,14,8/12/2013,2.0,located in Westfield mall  there's a bunch of parking surrounding the restaurant  that can get really crowded on weekends.I guess I came on the wrong night  but the service was really lacking. This was my first time here  recommended by my friend. it seems like a really popular place  we waited about 30 min to get a table for 4 on a friday night. we got seated and placed our orders in. but that was the last we ever saw of our waitress. our waters did not get filled  the ketchup we asked for never came. Not to mention a buss boy spilled his tray of dishes onto my friend. I know this wasn't his fault  however  the way he handled it was terrible. Rather than offer a towel FIRST to dry off the customer  he attempted to clean up the dishes before his boss could see that it happened.Bringing up the service at the end of the meal with the manager  he asked if there was anything he could do and said that he could pay for HALF of our pizookie. This was kind of a slap in the face  as he could not even offer to cover the whole thing after all that had happened.Service: 1 starOverall: 2 stars  won't be coming back  if it wasn't for the service I'd probably come back here again bc the food wasn't that bad. My friends got the pizza  I had the fish tacos  3-3.5 stars for the food alone.
Daryl W.,Los Angeles  CA,197,248,19,3/23/2014,2.0,I only come BJ's for the Pizookie and sometimes they can't even get that right. The hostesses leave a lot to be desired. I think it's a tough job herding all of those people that show up  but they seem ill equipped and even worst with their presentation. The servers and bartenders were pretty great  but again my pizookie was lacking. Tried BJ's brewed beer  just ok. All in all  I'd agree with a previous reviewer  if you really want this experience  and with a slightly tamer crowd  go to Yard House.
Quisha H.,Palms  Los Angeles  CA,449,517,919,7/5/2010,3.0,"I love Bjs for drinks and dessert (as said in my review of the torrance location). But this particular location is very hit or miss. Sometimes the service is quick  efficient  and attentive. Unfortunately its mostly slow and not very helpful :/ It also gets a little...""hood"" (sorry I had no better description) and crowded towards the evening. Parking is also a beast because of all the new develpment in the mall. So be prepared to park further away and do some walking.I prefer not to come to this location but if I\'m in the area it will do."
Ivy M.,Los Angeles  CA,54,157,310,4/20/2014,3.0,My friend and I meet up every so often to catch up over lunch and we almost always meet up at BJ's.Service was sort of a hit/miss  I say this because the first time we had very courteous servers  while the second time when we asked to be reseated in a booth with less air conditioning  we were met with sass from the hostess and a waitress who seemed to be overwhelmed with tables (this may not have necessarily been her fault  but we're still patrons too) Despite this  the food has been consistently good. The first time I had the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread pizza with a salad  while the second time around I had the stuffed potato with the salad (and the gluten free chocolate chip 'pizookie' for dessert which was quite delightful ^_^)I resisted the temptation of trying the booze in the presence of my friend (she's just a minute or two shy from being legal lol) but I may consider trying the Long Island Iced Tea on my own time.
Dave W.,Los Angeles  CA,189,213,44,10/7/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Went back with the in-laws. We waited 30 minutes for a table at 6:00 pm on Saturday  when there were 20 open tables (4 needing bussed  4 just open  and 12 together seemingly due to understaffing). That excludes the patio  which I didn't peruse. Balsamic Chicken Salad was drowning  and the bottom of the chicken had been burned. Their beer is good  however  the advertised master brews were not actually stocked.
Mia A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,1,8/25/2014,1.0,Horrible. There was a gnat in my water my first visit. Waiter forgot half of my order second visit. Plenty of my friends inc. Myself have gotten free meals from corporate due to a less than decent dining experience.If you want bj's  travel to Westwood!
Drew B.,Culver City  CA,362,615,478,8/10/2011,1.0,3 Strikes and you're OUT!!!Ordered a well done pie to go because when it opened the place was a zoo. Got it home and it was underbaked and raw doughy. Raw pizza dough gross. Wife tooke it back and the Manager couldn't seem to care less. No hook up no apologies just a refund.Went on a school fundraiser night. Waited 30+ minutes w/ all the kids. No problem. Then waited 30 more to get some drinks. Manager came by poured two people extra wine for the tardiness  but what about the other ten people. Clue!?Last time pizza came and was underdone again. Hey BJs turn up your oven or slow down the conveyor or get a new chef or jump in a lake.Have always loved their pizza and enjoyed the beer. NEVER again.
KaThy T.,Huntington Beach  CA,1193,1116,92,12/17/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Since I have to watch what I am eating for the next month  I opted for the Bison Burger. I know  it's not that healthy  but it was healthier than the other options. My friend got the Mahi Mahi with the rice and veggies. She also ordered the calamari. I got to sample both her dishes  which were good. Mine was good as well. It burger was served on wheat buns with a side of salad which kind of tasted like cole slaw. Everything was great; we were stuffed to the max. And we had a pretty cool server who was on top of things during the crowded night we came.
Frank Y.,Culver City  CA,6,57,45,12/8/2014,4.0,Checking the pizza out here ! The waiter service was good here  the deep dish pizza was okay  just to much dough for me. The Clam Chowder wasn't hot enough.
Jason B.,Culver City  CA,0,3,,2/25/2015,1.0,Waited so long for my food that I gave up and left. Waiting an hour for your food is ridiculous.
Dee M.,Marina del Rey  CA,0,3,,7/1/2015,4.0,I Love  love  love their Jambalaya. My favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake....the only reason to go off my diet!
La Neshay C.,Ontario  CA,2,31,61,3/19/2016,5.0,So i must say this is one of the hardest BJs location to find parking at . I don't live in LA so I normally go to the one in Chino Hills or in Ontario but since I was out here in LA to visit my uncle with my dad we wanted to go to a BJs near his house . It took us a long time to find parking but we finally did in the parking structure . We walked through the mall and outside to the get to BJs  which wasn't that far of a walk like I thought it would be . It was kind of weird to me that the wait was about 15 minutes but they had so many empty tables and so many servers working . We finally was called for our table and the host was walking quite fast and we almost lost him because he seemed like he was in a rush. We finally was seated and our waiter came by and greeted us . I must say he was GREAT. I wish I would have gotten his name but I do know he has an Irish accent because we asked him where he is from. He was able to recall our whole order without writing anything down  and we had a lot of stuff just for the three of us ! He even was happy to change my drink to strawberry lemonade last minute because I originally ordered a Shirley temple . I ordered the queso dip w chili which was pretty watery to me but it tasted okay and a bbq brisket and bacon burger with wedges that was really good. My dad had hot wings   clam chowder which was also watery compared to normal but was still good and the root beer ribs which he ate in 5 seconds. Last my uncle had garlic Parmesan wings which were sooo good and the new spaghetti and meatballs . Over all the food was good   I left very satisfied and full and the customer service was great . Besides the host kind of speeding off it was a great dinner . I will definitely be back !
michael b.,Sherman Oaks  CA,1,9,,6/29/2015,5.0,Ate lunch at BJ's over the weekend  the food was good  the service was good and the management comped the meal for me and my Make A Wish family--6 of us total after our day-long shopping spree. We didn't even have the chance to ask for a discount! Kudos to this location for being so kind and generous and we definitely recommend!!
Jay T.,Irvine  CA,129,380,56,5/17/2012,2.0,For some reason  the pizza always tastes better at the Westwood location. I did notice it was much better when I reheated it in the stove the next day.When my family was visiting we came here. There was some kind of mix-up with the bill  so the server took it back and charged us again  properly. My mother (who was dealing with the bill)  asked for the voided original receipt  and the waiter couldn't figure out how to do it. So the manager came over and dealt with it  assuring her that the first charge was voided. A few weeks later  the credit card statement came. And there were two charges. So she had to call them. And deal with it again.
Robert C.,Los Angeles  CA,4,17,,7/1/2013,3.0,Well  let's just say there's not much to get excited about here. With several TV monitors  maybe it works as a Sports Bar (you could be horrible at that and yet still beat out downtown Hooters). The food's nothing special  but not terrible. BBQ Seafood or BBQ Chicken are decent choices. Steamed Veggies are weak - limp  lots of soft squash. Pizza looked good at another table. Have had no problem with the wait time - usually 5-15 minutes on Sunday early evening - but we are a twosome  and the place is huge. Their house made beer is just ok - again nothing to be excited about. To sum it up  this place isn't special  but you won't be highly disappointed if you happen to end up here.Unfortunately  service varies - there are a couple of really good waiters here  and then there's the rest. We always ask to be seated with...hey wait  if I tell you  you'll have your behind in my seat!
Rey L.,El Segundo  CA,120,847,1955,11/16/2009,3.0,I'm always confused when my waiter does not write our order down. I don't know if I should be impressed or concerned. We're not picky orderers  necessarily. Here's the order... hers - Grilled Chicken sandwich  no mayo  side salad  ranch on the side  thin cut fries... mine - BJ burger  medium  with onions  steak fries  side of mayo  buffalo sauce and bbq (we like dipping sauces for fries). Now  our waiter read all that back to us perfectly without writing anything down  and it didn't appear too convoluted to us. The sandwich and burger came first with the food runner. We both got thin cut fries. Not as hot as it should've been. No salad for the gf. No onions on my burger. No sauces. No offer for a water order. Luckily no mayo on the chicken. Waited a couple mins and signalled the waiter. I didn't bother asking for the steak fries or onions  but just politely asked for the sauces and the salad. The waiter happily obliged and brought it out expeditiously. He did appear sincere with his concern with why our order didn't come out as we expected. Now  I will add that this was a sunday afternoon  at the mall. So  I expected it to be busy and we're not uptight about these sorts of things. We got sat pretty fast. The remainder of the meal went off without a hitch. I do have to add  with some hesitation  that the manager came around to a couple tables to appease some unhappy patrons. I will clarify that they had shopping bags and kids so I'm sure the adults were already on edge from coming through the mall to go eat. I was torn between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I guess I just don't want some kid to have to be laid off for something that perhaps wasn't his fault. So  I gave it 3. Take it with a grain of salt.
Kristen D.,Santa Monica  CA,6,10,,6/20/2015,1.0,Every time I come to this restaurant I get the WORST service. Not only do I have to wait over 2 hours to be served  but the waiters are ALWAYS horrible. They can't seem to refill drinks or check on the tables they wait on. The food is never worth the wait here  ever. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Manager was unimpressive as well. Absolutely horrible service.
Rickesha M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,1/16/2015,1.0,I freakin hate this location  everytime I try to give them a chance  they show their behinds. The service is extremely poor  I haven't met a waiter with decent Customer Service skills yet. I take forever to take your order  even if you already know what you want. Tonight's waitress brought our drinks  and then told us to hold on while she turned to the have a coversation with the table across from us (they were seated after us)  and then when she finished I tried to get her attention to remind her that we were ready to order  she then againg told us to wait and walked away. This place is all about making you wait til you lose your appetite.
Gabriel C.,Inglewood  CA,6,16,,1/2/2015,2.0,Poor service. Went during happy hour  waited 15 min just to get our tabel cleaned and another 20 just to get our drinks and appatizers. They should get more waiters. I don't like to wait that long
Christy G.,Paramount  CA,101,2,,12/27/2014,1.0,The service is terrible and the manager was no help. Switched our drinks after refills  we had to wait a while after our meal for silverware  they took us to seating that was not available so we had to back to the waiting area.. And they didn't compensate for the trouble
Mahogany C.,Arleta  CA,278,134,240,8/4/2013,4.0,Great service! Came here late on a Friday night. This place was filled with lots of patrons but not too crowded. Appetizers and food came out in a timely manner. Our waitress (I think her name was April) was extremely personable and attentive. She ended up with a 30% tip. Which says a heck of a lot these days. I gave 4 stars because my beer had tiny bug in it (ugh!).....but once I brought it to her attention  she quickly brought out another .... no muss no fussI love this location
Anjelica A.,Long Beach  CA,128,300,468,5/20/2013,2.0,I love BJ's in general  but this location in particular is lacking in service and quality. I feel like the Torrance and Cerritos locations have more professional staff and better food. Came here last night for dinner.We walked up to the hostess stand  and there were 3 employees talking to each other and another customer for a long time. The party in front of us stood there awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged. Once the hostess finally greeted us and took our names  we all waited about 10 minutes  and then they tried to seat us before the party in front of us. They mixed up both of our parties' names and there was confusion all around. Did I detect a sharp note in the hostess's voice directed toward us after I corrected her pronunciation of my name? I don't think I imagined that.We were finally seated and our waiter was Sayeed (sp?). My BF ordered the Bold and Amber taster set of beers and the bacon cheeseburger with a garden salad. I ordered the black cherry soda and the build-your-own hand-tossed pizza with pepperoni  meatballs  mushrooms  and roasted garlic  with a Caesar salad. After I ordered my pizza  the waiter abruptly walked away from the table; I had to call after him that I wanted to include a salad too. Also  he didn't ask my boyfriend what kind of French fries he wanted with his burger.The waiter ended up bringing him the Pale and Hoppy taster set  which was not what he had ordered. Also  I think BJ's has changed the recipe for the black cherry soda -- it used to be served in a chilled mug and the flavors of cherry and vanilla really popped in your mouth; last night it was served in a regular class and tasted watery and flat. My boyfriend's burger came with shoestring French fries instead of wedge  and my pizza crust was overly toasted around the edges but soggy in the middle. Since we were seated so close to the hostess stand  I could see the employees gossiping there (or at least it looked like that's what they were doing). I'm not against having fun at work  but at one point  It appeared that they were talking trash about another waitress and flirting with a male employee. The mediocre food  unprofessional staff  and order mix-ups all added up to make it a disappointing Sunday dinner.
Lanie G.,Los Angeles  CA,74,9,22,3/23/2015,3.0,Very good happy hour and late night happy hour. Not always the best service. Food never disappoints. Huge portions. Make sure to call and reserve a table for big groups or special occasions  as the wait can be pretty long at times.
M R.,Culver City  CA,11,140,50,8/9/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Went back as we had a class across the street it was 5.00 pm so not busy place looked cleaner  Great Server Oscar made sure we had top notch service. Food was ok.Salmon Moroccan style was Meh!! Pizza was puffy like a doughnut .cheese was a bit funky if it was not straight Mozzarella. Menus need to be loved they were sticky.Improved since last visit.
Amir D.,Culver City  CA,108,267,,7/24/2013,4.0,Some of these reviews are so ridiculous. You are at a place that specializes in beer and pizza. Why in the fuck would you get Jambalaya they don't specialize in that? If you want Jamabalaya go to a Creole joint for the authentic stuff. With that being said get the Mediterranean Pizza you cannot go wrong. Plus get the Avocado Egg Rolls off the hizzooook. And if you are truly feeling like a fattie get the Pizookie. Wit that being enjoy some dark brews  watch the game and all the food snobs should just go to the Hipster joints and have kale chips and sandwiches on brioche buns.
Marcia W.,Los Angeles  CA,101,1,,3/21/2016,1.0,Worst service ever! Restaurant wasnt crowded and they took 20 minutes to come and ask us what we wanted to drink! And then another 40 mins to bring our food. Then the food was burned and we were missing food that they tried to charge us for! To top it off the manager came to speak with me and gave me coupons for the kids to eat for free but the damn things were expired!i will never be going back
vanessa r.,Los Angeles  CA,0,35,2,2/25/2015,1.0,"Terrible service & gave it more than one try but it failed every time. My last visit starts with being told that out wait time for table for two would be up to 20 min. After 30 min  we ask why we haven\'t been called when other people that arrived after have already been seated. The hostess rudely replies that our names ""probably"" had been called long ago even though we were sitting in front of a speaker and our device hadn\'t gone off at all. Hostess says she\'ll get a table as soon as possible but we wait another 15 min while other people are called and seated. We make another complaint and hostess gets defensive  says she wasn\'t there when other people were being called because she went to go ""check"" on open tables when there was one right in front of us. She seats us and apologizes for the wait but never took any responsibility  she blamed it on it being busy. We didn\'t acknowledge the apology nor did we look at her. She offered to get us started on drinks but after the service  we weren\'t in the mood so we declined. However  when she says ""my pleasure  the waiter will be with you shortly ok?"" - there\'s no need to say a 2nd ""Ok?!"" The silence meant we are pissed off and hungry! Never coming back here again."
Lisa W.,Los Angeles  CA,43,82,16,5/29/2013,2.0,Run of a mill restaurant chain located in a parking-challenged mall. Now that this restaurant chain has published calories next to its entrees  it take the fun out of grabbing a beer  some fried appetizers  and some pizza. It's a heart attack waiting to happen!For those who can look past the calories (e.g. marathon runners or triathletes)  there's a great all-American variety of food  including their fabulous pizza and comprehensive list of beers.  Food is good for restaurant-chain type of food. Waiters  on the other hand  are always seem to be challenged  and service suffers. Never know where they disappear...
Nicole B.,Santa Monica  CA,711,575,391,2/20/2012,2.0,While the staff here is great  my food is never on point at this location!My drinks were gross AND my pazookie was as hard as wood....avoid this location especially because parking is horrribleee.
Cheryl N.,Los Angeles  CA,55,16,8,7/24/2013,2.0,I like Bj's food which is why I keep coming back. Unfortunately since this place opened a couple of years ago I have to say that the service has always been lacking. From the excessive waiting time for the food to arrive to the staff not being knowledgeable about the menu. I was here recently and our order was messed up  and my friend ended up waiting an extra 45 minutes for her food to arrive. By then the rest of us had finished our meals. The waiter was very nice and apologetic  but then we received our bill and the wrong item was still on the bill  and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes to gt the correct bill  and get our change to leave. He did not een comp us anything  not that we were expecting it  but it would have been nice. For a place that it always busy  I would just think that they would have more staff helping wait tables  and more staff in general to help out. I will not be returning for a long time. On a side note  although our waiter was very nice  the guy who brought out our food was not nice at all. He made faces when we asked for extra condiments  and practically threw the plates on the table. I wanted to complain to a manager  but was pressed for time.
Shaquille S.,Los Angeles  CA,53,9,2,4/2/2013,1.0,I really wanted to like this place  but i just couldn't do itI've eaten here twice and both times its been the same problem  The food has absolutely no flavor. My first visit I tried the Stuffed bake potato. The cheese tasted like plastic and the potato was super dry. Today I thought i'd try the pasta  that's impossible to screw up right? Wrong again! Had to be the worst chicken alfredo i've ever had. Would have had a better meal if I stayed home and ate one of those little blue box tv dinners  at least then I would have tasted something. I cant believe so many people i know rave about this place  am I missing something? Maybe if I knock back a few glasses of they're super overpriced house beers  i'll be able to stomach another meal here. Nah  ill just march right next door to Lucille's  they always take good care of me
Megan M.,Torrance  CA,18,75,12,4/17/2013,3.0,I love BJs in general. But this place needs and employee makeover. Strike One: Hostess is rude. Took her five minutes of avoiding eye contact and walking around her 2ft by 2ft booth to tell us our party of four would be seated when the other lady came back.Strike two: Lady comes back and talks to hostess (straight gossip) for another 5 minutes while the four of us stand there on our lunch hour. Strike three: Food was not cooked as well as other locations. We sat for 15 minutes trying to flag down our waiter for our bill. We received refills after we had already paid (none throughout the hour we were there.) Not to mention the hostess girls need to dress more professional. Bras hanging out while the rest of the staff is professional. I could have gone to a fast food place if I wanted that view. Not so horrible that I would say to avoid it  but definitely not up to par with other BJs locations. Definitely not the place to go on your lunch hour. There are lots of other food places that will have you in and out with much better service in this area.
Heather M.,Castro Valley  CA,5,19,,4/24/2013,2.0,Been here twice  just to make sure our first experience wasn't a fluke.First visit: food was okay  not great. Was in a group of five  some of our food was cold. The worst part? Our server was borderline hostile. Sighed when we asked for stuff. Overall pretty rude.Second visit: minor success - a nicer server. However she still managed to fly right by our table without checking up on us when we needed her. I had the Thai mango salad  which was good  but my fiancee's burger and fries was cold. And there was a smudge of something gross in his beer glass. We had to ask to get it replaced  which at least the server did without complaint.I'll probably not bother coming back here again.
Astrid S.,Los Angeles  CA,97,17,40,2/7/2016,3.0,"We came here for dinner as a second choice because our first choice closed early on Superbowl Sunday night. We ordered calamari and a large pizza (half BJs favorite and half BBQ chicken). Both were delicious and thick. The calamari wasn\'t bad but it wasn\'t great; I\'ve had WAY better calamari than theirs. Now about the service.... It\'s not great. It\'s slow and almost as if there are only 2-3 servers for the whole place. A couple booth were dirty but supposedly ""ready"" for guests to sit in. I think service needs A LOT of improvement in this place."
Nicholas P.,Los Angeles  CA,10,26,6,9/26/2013,3.0,The food is great but it is noisy  hard to get a seat without a wait and sometimes the staff are not as attentive as they could be. I have eaten here several times and on two occasions had to send the food back as it arrived cold. Other than that there are many great beers to sample.One time my wife forgot her credit card and by the time we realized it and went back to the restaurant  someone had found it and it was used several times by different people. Odd huh?So to sum up  I would continue to go back there  because  when they get it right  they are great!!
Audrey M.,San Gabriel  CA,30,46,13,10/7/2014,1.0,Very slow service  our assigned waittress didn't even greet us or asked if we needed water when we sat down. Definitely not returning.
Melody T.,Las Colinas  TX,605,629,2722,1/11/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Stopped for a quick beer and yep they do remember me here!!! Love Erin to death! Keep it up ma"""
Nedra J.,Los Angeles  CA,877,39,65,10/28/2014,1.0,Usually have pretty good service here but went here for a birthday dinner we was told they could help us or sit us together then once half of the party sat at the table and other sat in the booth . To get actual water took almost an hour once the food arrive I had to find a waiter to get my own plate and drink manager didn't help any with service or get another waiter for our party . Never heard any manager tell customers they can't sit together just weird turning money away and not customer service at all . Our waiter did what he could but he was by his self with almost a party of 20 people this manager needs more training in this department .
Mary R.,Hawthorne  CA,23,43,42,1/12/2015,3.0,Boss decided to take us out to lunch and I picked BJ'S. Our waitress was ok  maybe having an off day so decided not to mention her name. She just felt disconnected from her job. I looked around and noticed the other servers attitudes. They were happy and upbeat and seemed to enjoy their customers. Anywho  the manager was very friendly and accommodating. I didn't get his name but he was very helpful. He offered me a free pazooki coupon but silly me I walked out and forgot it. C'est la vie. Maybe next time things will be better
Daveda R.,Inglewood  CA,0,2,,5/28/2015,1.0,Worst service and food ever.... I had to pay a portion of the meal cost because I didn't like the main course. Management didn't care about the complaint  nor did corporate. Never again will my family have any more gatherings at this location (perhaps this company).
Nesha B.,Hawthorne  CA,222,250,107,7/22/2013,4.0,Place was not crowded at all for a sunday i was shocked since this location is at the mall. im always a fan of Bjs and this location is just as nice as the one in Torrance. I like how the manager walked to my table and asked how was the service and asked if we needed anything. which was great because i had no complaints but then i also noticed how he was walking to all the guest tables interacting which made my visit here even more pleasant.
Dave R.,East Hampton  CT,0,117,4,10/6/2014,4.0,The mojito was good at happy hour  but I didn't eat any food. Quite a crowd during MNF.
Grecia C.,Torrance  CA,2,14,2,3/22/2015,1.0,Love the pizza but the service at this location is terrible. Our server lacked in customer service. Our appetizer came after our meal and it was cold. The server barely communicated with us. I hope the customer service problem is resolved here soon. Until then  go to a different location.
Ebony B.,San Diego  CA,116,91,77,1/21/2013,3.0,I have been a long-time fan of BJ's  ever since my friend introduced me to the Great White. It had been a couple of years since I had been to BJ's  so I gladly returned considering I was way overdue. I split a Great White deep dish pizza with my friend. Medium is more than enough for two hungry chicks; large would have been good to take home leftovers. I don't know if it's because BJ's has changed it's recipe  or if it's that all BJ's are not created equal  but the pizza was a tad bit below my expectations for BJ's. Mainly the crust... it was kinda dry and not as greasy. I guess that's a good thing  but we're talking BJ's  not a frozen diet dinner. Also  the pizza itself was kind of dry-ish. It wasn't sink-your-teeth-into-it pleasurable  like I normally feel when I eat their pies. The thing that saves this BJ's location from getting a lower score is the fact that their other menu items taste the way they should when compared to other BJ's. They have such a wide menu and almost anything you order is guaranteed to be delicious. Everyone talks about their Pazookie  which  if not for that  I wouldn't be trying to make them at home now... but their Baked Beignet is extremely good! With it's whip cream and french vanilla ice cream sitting atop a warm  fluffy  lightly crisp beignet  drizzled with strawberries and strawberry syrup... you cannot go wrong! (unless they prepare this differently  too).I would return to this BJ's again  however  my expectations would be lowered and I would probably get the other items (like a deluxe salad or loaded baked potato) instead of the pizza.
Kevin S.,Brea  CA,180,312,35,4/22/2011,2.0,This place has exceptionally crappy service compared to the handful of other BJ's I've been to. This BJ's is part of the Westfield mall in Culver City... unfortunately this leads to inconvenient parking relative to the restaurant location.I'm not surprised to see other comments for this particular location saying the service sucks. 2 stars because the food was on par with other BJ's.
Erin O.,Los Angeles  CA,3,25,,1/28/2016,5.0,Food is always good. Gotta have the lemon thyme chicken  ribs  thin crust pizza  or jambalaya. Service is always good as long as you're polite. Let's face it  the demographic in this neighborhood can be tough to serve  so don't judge on some of the reviews. Or server tonight  Juan V. was super professional and manager Eugene is a gem. I will always crave bjs and always come here for my fix!
Sonya Z.,New Orleans  LA,387,877,10,7/29/2013,3.0,Haha  I can't believe I'm reviewing a BJs! Well  props to them for being the only place around this particular Culver City area that was serving food around midnight on Friday night. I was at a comedy show with a group of friends and we wanted munchies  but after a couple failed attempts at finding places with open kitchens (like Sara the Wine Bar) we ended up making the trek to BJs. The service was the highlight - our server was very patient with our large group of various orders and a check split 10 different ways. I shared the mahi mahi tacos with my friend and they were definitely edible. BJs - not the best option  but a solid option.
David L.,Fort Mitchell  KY,3,33,1,1/15/2013,1.0,So wow. This is the second BJ's I've been too. I went to the one in Century City a couple weeks ago and found the place to be pretty nice. Good Staff  good food  good service. Running on the theory that all chain restaurants all pretty much the same I went to this one. Well I was wrong. Slow service  although the bar wasn't that busy. I ordered a cup of clam chowder and a mini pizza. I got the pizza first. Nice. The chowder showed up afterwards. The bar staff was nice enough to take my pizza away to stay warm. It came back 60 seconds later reheated to the point it was goo. So I tried the chowder  bland with big huge chunks of a chewy tasteless substance I assumed was clams. couldn't finish that. The pizza believe it or not (since they heated twice) was undercooked. No one asked nor seemed to care that I was not enjoying my food. So I ate what I could stomach and waited for my bill. And waited. And waited. And waited.... Lovely.Obviously all BJ's are not created equal. And now I feel dirty for typing that out...
Claire P.,Los Angeles  CA,2,35,12,1/12/2015,2.0,We went here for brunch with about 8 people. The service was spotty. The drinks took forever and came out at different times. The food was mixed  some was ok  some was cold. We had to ask for condiments 3 times before we got them. service needs to improve!
Baxter R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,8/10/2015,5.0,We have dined here numerous times!! If this place is under new management or they finally get it my hat is off to you!!! We had a beautiful dining experience here Late Yesterday Sunday Afternoon!!! The service was great and our meal was fantastic!!!! The Rib-eye Steaks are fantasic!!! I never bother to write reviews but felt the need to for you. This place has come a long long way from when you first opened and you deserve the credit now!!!! Good job and our new to go spot often as we can!!! Thanks BJs to a job well done!!
Jojuane P.,Washington  DC,90,76,505,11/15/2013,2.0,Just not very good bar food. Wonder how much is just frozen or pre-made from Sysco and thrown into a fryer or oven. Ribs seemed baked with sauce just thrown up top. Pizza isn't very good. If you want to hang with friends and watch the game  it's OK. I'd eat before I get there.
Cheryl T.,Riverside  CA,68,62,784,11/25/2014,3.0,"Let me start off by saying my family likes BJ\'s Restaurants. We have been to this location several times. The most recent was a few days ago  Sunday evening. They have new holiday menus which we all decided to order from. My daughter ordered the ""New Deep Dish Lasagna. If you look at the photos I\'ve posted  you will see that they skimped on her ""ravioli"". It was so dry (lacked fresh marinara sauce) probably due to sitting under a heat lamp. It tasted much better after we asked for some extra sauce. Mom ordered the House Top Sirloin w/Lemon Garlic Shrimp. The shrimp was good but a little on the salty side. Although the steak was ordered medium  it was received well done  with the burnt side facing down. (I guess they thought if they put the burnt side down no one would notice.) Our waitress agreed it was overcooked  took mom\'s plate to show the cook & then brought her plate back. It took a while for mom to get the ""correctly"" grilled steak (cooked medium RARE this time) but at least she was able to eat her Cheddar mashed potatoes & broccoli while waiting. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi & Parmesan crusted scallops with steamed green beans & roasted brussels sprouts. The mahi mahi was spicy dry without a trace of lemon Chardonnay butter sauce. Maybe next time I\'ll try the grilled mahi mahi. The beans were excellent! Fresh & steamed to perfection. The brussels sprouts were very disappointing in comparison to the beans. Just look at my photo. Service was very good otherwise this would\'ve been a 2 star rating. Please keep in mind this rating is an average of all previous visits to this particular location."
Karla C.,Inglewood  CA,0,4,,4/21/2015,4.0,Bjs has some tasty and crunchy pizza to enjoy  recommended:)..my mother loves this place  food  service  and also because its right next to the mall.
Dani Z.,Culver City  CA,127,277,654,8/28/2011,3.0,Came with a group of 6...admittedly  the cause of service being poor is 50/50 due to our party (we weren't all there when we were seated and some members decided to wait on the late comer  whereas  I personally would have been fine to not wait) I was seated in the corner and felt like our waitress was in such a rush that I got forgotten. Drink refills took forever  and I had to repeat my request. When dessert orders were taken  I wasn't asked on the first pass. My brother noted that he thought it was funny (not ha-ha) that she came back pretty quickly once the bill was left  and of course  that took a while to figure out among the party and we had to keep sending her away as we passed it to one another trying to figure out our shares. This next part may seem a little too hyper critical  but as we left  the group went to the front and I went to the restroom. In going toward the front to meet them  I decided to cut through the bar area  and there was a very narrow area to walk. In doing so  there was a host walking a party through to seat them. I stepped to the side for the woman in front of him to pass  but he should have allowed me to pass  rather than walking past me and making me wait as the party he was seating followed. I had to wait through 5 people. No  it's not a HUGE deal  but it is a courtesy  and as the host  knowing people were following...he should have had the courtesy of offering me to pass  first. I wish I could give the evening better props. The food was tasty and so was my sample of PM Porter...but everything else left little to be desired.PS - you can call ahead your reservation  though you may still have to wait a few minutes once you arrive.
Jade P.,Los Angeles  CA,30,156,216,10/14/2013,3.0,I come here all the time because I live in the area the food is always cool and I love the pazookies but tonight this review is strictly on my lemon drop..... It's just ok  not sweet  not really strong  just ok! I guess it all depends on the bartender. Tonight this bartender gets an average C for this average lemon drop martini!
Sara K.,Los Angeles  CA,15,9,1,1/31/2015,4.0,I'm not really sure what's with the low reviews here. My boyfriend and I just had a really nice experience. My Parmesan Crusted Chicken was fab and he enjoyed his steak. We were seated promptly and our waitress was great (and offered to bring out more of the lemon Chardonnay sauce because it's awesome). It's not the swankiest place for dinner but I'd come back here again.
Micael M.,Inglewood  CA,7,71,,12/30/2014,2.0,The wait time for a table has gotten better. The staff for the most part is good. It's really hit and miss. The beer is delicious and the variety is awesome. The Alfredo is pretty tasty but the real star is the pizza and pizzoki
Cristina W.,Beverly Hills  CA,63,102,36,3/22/2013,2.0,Came here for lunch because it was an easy midpoint meeting spot between my friends and I. Everything was fine  the server was nice  until they brought the wrong orders out for my friend and I (we ordered the same thing). We flagged our server down and she immediately took the wrong plates away and said the kitchen would work quickly to make our correct order. The manager even came out to apologize  which is a nice gesture  but I would have thought they would have at least comp'd us an appetizer or dessert or our soda/ice teas (they didn't offer). I'm sure if we had made an issue of it  they would've comp'd something  but why do I need to ask for something to compensate for their error?Anyhow  after my correct food came out  it was okay - the sauce was heavy/salty (I got the salmon teriyaki bowl) and I could only get through half of it before feeling like I needed to drink a gallon of water. If you need a quick bite to eat  this place is okay/convenient with lots of seating. Not the place for you if you want fresh  healthy food or a supreme culinary experience.Self-parking was a bit tough to find (esp. during busier times) as it's party of the larger Westfield Mall  although there's valet directly in front for you ballers.
Ed T.,Torrance  CA,34,197,27,9/13/2011,3.0,I've been to BJs a few times and like The Counter  the service is hit or miss. During my most recent visit the service was spot on. Our server whos name escapes me  was most pleasant and made my dinning experience enjoyable. Now on to the food. We started off with the ahi tuna  which was decent. I've certainly had better quality almost everywhere else  but the dish was still enjoyable. We also ordered the avocado eggrolls  which were also tasty. I decided on the shrimp tacos  wich were worse than Rubio's shrimp taco's. The shrimp were over fried  which made them so tough and rough  I cut the roof of my mouth on one of them. Overall  I can't say I've found a reason to return to BJ's  especially with Lucille's next door.
Kim T.,San Gabriel  CA,341,847,5505,8/25/2011,4.0,So my coworkers took me here for my second to last day with the Company  and so it was bittersweet (Happy to be moving on with my life  but sad to be leaving the fun memories I had with this place)....We got here around 12 noon during lunch time  and surprisingly  it wasn't that crowded  and so we were seated in a booth right away. Our waitress was friendly  and attentive  and got our drinks right away. We all had ordered from the Lunch Specials. Two of my coworkers for the shrimp or fish tacos  which came with two tacos of either choice  some colored chips  and with a side of little salad and some guac and salsa. My other coworker ordered the tomato bisque soup with a whole grilled ham cheese sandwich sliced into four pieces. I had ordered the Chicken Parmagiana with Spaghetti and two pieces of garlic bread  with a drink of Black Cherry Soda (tasted like Currant  more than Black Cherry). The garlic bread was yummy  but a little bit stiffed  but the tomato sauce helped soften it. The pasta was perfect - not too al dente and the chicken was the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Very moist and juicy! Afterwards  we ordered a Triple Threat Chocolate pizookie  and it was so super creamy and indulgent - melt in your mouth perfection. Superb! Overall  the lunch was pretty good. Reasonably priced around $9.00 a plate  and right portions for lunch time. Good enough to fill the tummy  but not heavy enough to make you so sleepy that you want to take a nap.One star off because the service was a bit slow. Our waitress was attentive when she was there  but disappeared for a while when we needed her for the boxes to pack up our food or to get our change back from paying the bill.
Nelson F.,Culver City  CA,408,597,1067,11/16/2012,3.0,My neighborhood BJ's Chicago Brewhouse  another advantage of living close to the nearby Culver City Westfield Mall. Great coming in for happy hour on Sunday afternoon to watch football at the bar  where they have discounted mini pizzas  drinks and other appetizers. Food quality is decent  pizzas are always good for deep dish Chicago style and they have a great selection of beer. Service has always been friendly and they have late night happy hour  so I regularly stop by. Pretty dependable when hunger strikes after 10 and I don't feel like making anything myself.
Michael S.,Los Angeles  CA,34,8,2,5/6/2013,2.0,My wife and I visited on a Saturday evening because we were in the mood for some good beer. Although we expected the place to be busy  the wait time was minimal  and we avoided it altogether by sitting in a booth in the bar area. We assumed this would result in quicker service. This was not the case as it took a long time for a cheese burger and buffalo chicken pizza to arrive. When the pizza arrived it was lukewarm and soggy. The pizza also has a sweet taste as if BBQ sauce had been used. Our server went on break and her replacement did not come by once to check on the meal. My wife left most of her pizza uneaten and he did not ask if we wanted a box to take it home. After we finished eating he also did not ask if we wanted dessert or more beer. He seemed like a nice enough guy  but for some reason he ignored us. Unlikely we will visit here any time soon.
Emily A.,Downtown  Los Angeles  CA,66,22,9,8/17/2014,5.0,I enjoy coming to this restaurant. The staff is very nice. Our waiter VA was very nice. We came for brunch  wasn't too busy. Been here on a Friday night and the staff is busy but very friendly. Food is awesome. I love how they have one page for healthy options.
DeAndre E.,Los Angeles  CA,33,14,4,11/5/2014,1.0,The most bad service I have experience today! Sitting by the bar the waitress take forever they won't even acknowledged you at all! Until is time to pay the bill and to make things worst the waitress had a really bad service never again!!
Mayerlin C.,Los Angeles  CA,5,4,,1/7/2015,1.0,Horrible Service! I don't even wanna come back here. Food is not that great. I just don't understand why they make you wait 15 minutes to be seated and there's a lot of tables available and the staff is just waiting around for their manager to tell them what to do. The food wasn't even hot when we got it. I rather pay more and go to Olive Garden!
Mista B.,Los Angeles  CA,11,41,13,12/7/2014,2.0,Terrible service and I literally saw a worker wipe the floor and then proceed to use the same cloth to wipe down the tables. DISGUSTING! The food is good but after seeing that I will not be back.
Samantha D.,Los Angeles  CA,154,4,,1/30/2015,1.0,I just had dinner here and the service is in major need of improvement. It took them forever to come to our table and take our orders and even longer for the food to come out. When our food finally came out (about 40mins later) it was cold and no one came to see if we were doing okay or needed refills. When we asked to speak to a manger excuses were thrown around and they tried to offer us a free dessert. Things could really be improved here
Dave S.,Culver City  CA,271,19,,5/9/2014,1.0,not sure if it's because we were here on a Friday night at 7pm but once we got seated  it took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then another 25-30 minutes before we got up and left as our server never came back. idon't expect great service from a chain restaurant on a Friday but damn  there was none at all. i still like the restaurant but won't be going back to this location again
Terri J.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,1/19/2016,1.0,During our meal a RAT ran under our table  ran back out waiter pretended like he didnt see it. When the manager Ryan Nathaniel was notified he acted like no big deal  and offered a $20 GIFTCARD. The manager Ryan was very rude as if I'm interested in returning ever.
S R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,12/14/2015,5.0,Well its been over a year since my boyfriend and I have been here due to the terrible service we had received!! Well today we decided to give it another go! It all started off terrible...making us remember why we hadnt been back in so long! But what really changed things for us was how nice our waitress and the manager were about the situation. My boyfriend and I both work in restaurants and understand how it can be! But to be honest it was rather slow and our food took forever!! and then I got mine cold.... but the way in which the manager on duty handled everything was amazing! You dont find that kind of customer service just anywhere!! Nowadays people dont really care it seems when you go out to eat customer service doesnt seem like a big deal. And most managers from our experience are arrogant and dont care to make sure you leave happy they just give a fake apology and are on their way. But I regret I am unable to remember his name  the manager on duty for lunch today  was very very kind and seemed very sincere with his apology and they way he handled everything we really appreciate it. Made our almost terrible experience turn out to be awesome! The waitress was also very kind! Things happen and we understand  in the end  its really how you approach the situation that makes a world of difference. Thank you guys again and we will be back in soon!
Robin S.,Los Angeles  CA,558,680,573,1/5/2011,4.0,I think BJ's is pretty darn great compared to Cheesecake Factory. One single thing that really pull me back here is their deep fried artichokes  really... and for $2.95 an order? I'm willing to throw my diet out the door for at least a day or two. I've been here three times and so far nothing is wrong with it... However  if you want to become a regular  don't look at the Nutritional booklet.
Alexa S.,Studio City  CA,671,310,65,8/7/2012,4.0,Let's say this about BJ's.I don't know how good the food ACTUALLY is. All's I know is that when you haven't eaten all day and you and your girls have just run nearly 6 miles in deadly beach heat  pretty much anything will taste balls-out amazing.That said... I had DREAMS about the Mexican Tortilla Soup last night. I mean sexy dreams. It was that creamy and luscious. I wanted to take this soup out to dinner and a movie and then look it in the eye and tell it I couldn't wait to call it tomorrow. AND I WOULD call it tomorrow. And then  if it told me it was getting deported back to Mexico  I would take it to Vegas and put a ring on it. Lock that shit down.Now  we had one of those deals where you get certain dishes for a set amount of money. The pizza was only passable. But it's deep dish and  to me  that's just not pizza. All pizza must be NY style or no style at all.The pizookie (cookie with ice cream)  while not a dessert person at all  was also yummy. And to be honest  there is something sexy about sharing that with your friend when you're both health obsessed rather than your man  who will eat anything. Pizookie is my new favorite non-sexual religious experience.Yeah  so... Make of BJ's what you will. It's a family restaurant in a MALL. Lower your expectations  kids.
Audrey M.,Los Angeles  CA,67,29,6,8/24/2014,5.0,First Time Here...Excellent Service. The waitress Keyla i believe it was her Name . She was polite and very friendly. We order Pizza and Mozarella Cheese Sticks and Beer. It was Really Good  I Recommend This Restaurant. :) i will be coming back real soon.
Eduardo X.,Los Angeles  CA,64,276,,1/5/2013,2.0,Not really into chain places  and yet I always find myself here whenever a group of non-adventurous people wanna meet for dinner.The service is adequate  the food is adequate  the prices are a tad too high.Dessert here  though  is pretty good.Well  this was a rather uneventful review  LOL. They're okay  that's about it.
Arleen P.,Los Angeles  CA,232,99,17,8/9/2012,2.0,"For the most part  you know what you are getting when you come to this chain BJs... theoretically it is a fun atmosphere  good place for drinks  to watch games  or to chill with some decent food. But honestly  I cannot recount ONE good  smooth outing here...the service and professionalism  pride in business do not exist at this location. First of all the service and reception desk are 95% of the time rude  and seem MISERABLE. EVERY TIME  whether busy or not  whether name put in in-advance or not  my party and I are waiting for ridiculous amounts of time and being treated like pests (one time a coworker of mine checking on our table that we had been waiting for over an hour--which happens EVERYTIME I HAVE COME HERE  was called a ""d*ck"" by the receptionist under her breath...and my coworker is very VERY polite and patient. It was so strange. The location is convenient otherwise I\'m sure it wouldn\'t have been chosen. The rare occasion the managers try to make it right  but it\'s RARE that they seem to be around. The servers are NEVER around  you wait for FOREVER to be seated and people there act like you are bothering them. Just get another job if you can\'t understand basic fundamentals of customer service.  I would never recommend this location to someone unless you want to set aside 4 hours for dinner and be frustrated by poor service. If you go to another location however  I recommend the mojitos  great white pizza  and traditional chocolate chip pizookie."
Dth S.,Los Angeles  CA,33,997,1,11/10/2015,4.0,i'd have to say that i really dig BJ's! they're so consistent and it doesn't matter which one you're at either because to me they really are all the same... and i haven't had a bad server yet at any of their locations either. the prices are good  the food's consistent  and i really like their beer!
Eric W.,West Jordan  UT,76,8,1,1/2/2015,4.0,Been here a few times but usually just by myself. Service for me has been good and the food has always been good. I can't leave without getting a pizookie.
Alexson L.,Orange  CA,112,281,19,7/28/2013,3.0,I've been to several BJ's for dinners with larger parties  but stopped by here for a better-than-usual lunch break  which made for speedy seating and service. That being said  the waitress sounded like a robot while advertising their specials and only came by once to refill our drinks closer to the end of our meal.BJ's itself is an excellent add to Westfield Culver City  but the mall itself doesn't attract the best of crowds.
Sean L.,Palms  Los Angeles  CA,1086,175,,11/13/2012,5.0,Woop. Woop. Bj's killed it. Came here a couple times last weekend for drinks. Look for Keyon (Key) or Sylvia to mix you up a drank. There are about 300 beers on tap at this place. It's in the Culver City Westfield Mall of the 90. Outdoor entrance only. Unreal set up. TV's every where. So cool. Like I said...300 tap beers. Endless booze bottles. Enjoyed a few Colorado Bulldogs  bloody marys  and beers throughout the weekend. The service is exemplarary. The food looks great. The location is awesome. THE DRINKS ARE EXCELLENT. Go here and shoot the breeze and watch sports!Great atmosphere.PROS: Fun-Affordable-Late night happy hour-Good drinks-Great service-Good location-TAP BEERCheers  broSean
Manny C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,1,1/5/2016,3.0,Great food  not so great service. Our waitress must have been new. She gets 3 stars for effort but never should we wait as long as we did for our food and bill! :(
Daniela Z.,Torrance  Los Angeles  CA,9,97,20,9/27/2015,1.0,this BJ's has the worst service! our server Nicole was too busy flirting away to the guys at the table next to us giving her number and facebook. she looks over at our table but continued to talk to those guys. it took us 30 minutes for her to come to our table and greet us. we had to ask the busser for a new server and the busser kindly found a new server for us and he took care of us. the table next to us had the same problem with the server. the manager was nowhere to be found. Saeed helped us out and he was so nice!
Emma T.,Los Angeles  CA,440,218,1406,7/9/2013,5.0,My staff loves this place  I take them there for a treat and they all vote to go to BJ'sThey give us special service and stay and talk with us and they very friendly. I would say that me and my staff are FANS of BJ's
Sean A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,1/27/2015,1.0,Went for a walk and stopped by the mall for a bite to eat. Walked in and stood and waited for a seat. We waited  waited a little longer  like fools waited a little for the staff who continued to ignore us. They were busy  but not that busy that you can't take a couple of seconds to acknowledge a customer and say we'll be right with you. We walked out  went across to Olive Garden where we were immediately greeted and seated. They were just as busy. But the staff makes a huge difference.
Sonya P.,Torrance  CA,193,16,4,11/21/2015,4.0,I come to this location once in awhile after work. Overall  I never have any problems with the food or drinks. The food quality seems to be pretty good. However  sometimes the service can be a bit slow. Taylor was our server the other night  and he was by far the most polite and professional server that I've had at this location.
Wendy M.,Tucker  GA,39,49,52,4/17/2015,3.0,Horrible service  ordered coffee and after waiting a while I was told that he was trying to fix the coffee machine..... Huh Okay? Minutes later it was yeah  yeah  your coffee it's coming no one at my table had their beverages twenty minutes after being seated. Clearly our waiter was stretched too thin AND inexperienced with managing the flow of tables in his section. Lucky for him our appetizer  the carnita fries  landed on the table just before I landed a right cross on our server. Unfortunately the rest of the meal wasn't as impressive  the deep dish lasagne tasted like it came from the frozen food section of Trader Joes which is fine if I were at home. My daughter barely touched her pork sandwich  and the broccoli n cheese soup came in a bowl so shallow  it should have been labeled a 'cup of soup'. The restaurant was very busy and one of the few places open late near the airport aside from bland and generic hotel food. So for being open I give them an additional star
Drew T.,Marina del Rey  CA,1,15,,12/4/2012,1.0,TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! And even worse management. Bottom line  I was the only customer picking up a to-go order and 2 different servers and the BJ's manager completely ignored me and refused to help complete my pickup order. So I just walked behind the counter and left exact change and took my food and left.I will never eat from there again.
Smriti S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,12/12/2015,1.0,My husband and I usually go to the Century City BJ's and are usually content. Since we happened to be at Fox Hills mall we decided to go to this location - bad move. Our server seemed nice and even though it took forever to get some service he provided us with okay service. We were there for an hour and a half to get a vegetarian pizza and a soup. Talk about waste of time. Anyway  fast forward to the next day and when my husband who is a vegetarian was eating his pizza  he noticed a huge piece of chicken. I called the restaurant so that they understand that when people make it clear that they are vegetarian  the restaurant needs to respect that and be careful. I was actually not that upset when I called the restaurant because mistakes happen but I just wanted to point out that they need to watch out for situations like this. The manager Eugene is a piece of work. He made me feel so bad about actually calling and talking about the issue as if I am only calling to get the refund. I am an auditor and my husband is an attorney so we really don't need to discuss dimes and pennies. So please Eugene  keep the $35 and provide others with better service. It's the customers who help you run your business so learn to respect them. Terrible.
Bren H.,Hawthorne  CA,3,34,9,10/23/2014,5.0,We have been here in the past with VERY slow/poor service. I used to go to the BJs in West Covina (near my work) which is great. We tried again tonight. The hostess was polite. Our waiter tonight (Sean? Shawn?) was nice  fun  and attentive. His serving team was fine. It was a little busy but service was good. There were disappointing menu changes but I tried something new (tilapia tacos) that were excellent. My husband had a special order (jambalaya - no shrimp  extra sausage) that came out correct. He reports that it was tasty. We asked for some extras that came out quickly. I love that they have a variety of brews (including hard cider). The Nutty Brewnette is one of my favs. They were playing good (to me) music but not too loud.
Nikki T.,Mid-City  Los Angeles  CA,6,67,24,10/1/2014,5.0,I try not to be so picky but I believe in excellent service. I received nothing short of it last night. I was greeted exceptionally quick & friendly by a woman named Tina. She was so polite & thorough. She made my visit with my family enjoyable. The waitress was also very quick  efficient  and friendly. This may have been my best visit this far. Tina was a breath of fresh air. Thank you very much. I hope you continue to take your job seriously & always keep the customer 1st. We will be back!!!
Amanda A.,Los Angeles  CA,1,13,4,4/28/2015,1.0,WORST SERVIVE EVER! I love bjs and I know the service they are suppose to give. This location is the worst ever!!! they do not welcome you  server is not welcoming. I am not rating this on a one time visit. I went about 4 times to maybe have a change of staff! I even brought it to the managers attention  still nothing has changed. I rather eat anywhere but this location.
Rubi L.,Palms  Los Angeles  CA,0,6,1,2/6/2015,5.0,I just want to make sure i leave a review for this great server i had last week when i went in to eat. Sarah was great!! her service was amazing. She has Great Service even though she was extremely occupied with other customers. Her great service was truly appreciated in these times it is hardly ever received!
Brandon M.,Vancouver  Canada,23,8,,1/5/2013,2.0,Generally  they are okay. They have a serious problem with consistency though  and that is a deal breaker. When your pizza comes back half the times doughy and other times cooked just right  its hard to justify a good review. Big deal breaker for me lastnight was ordering the Blue cheese burger to go. I ordered it well done  and have been burned by them in the past for doing this so I was a little worried it would be undercooked. I didn't have time to check at the restaurant though  and didn't want to ruin the burger by cutting it in half then letting it sit 10 mins in the car while I get home. It was not well done at all in the center  though on the outside it was dry and burnt looking/tasting. Bacon was great though  I replaced my patty with my fries and ate it without the beef...Someone just didn't know how to cook a burger properly. And that was my last straw. If you can't cook a burger right  what else are they messing up in there? Don't dare get any kind of seafood  not worth the risk!
Gerald W.,Burbank  CA,21,157,23,9/19/2014,2.0,Honestly this is the worst B'js I have ever been to. Extremely rude hostess  waitress had an attitude had a pretty bad attitude as well. I have been to a few different B'js in various area and this is the worst one I have ever been to. The food was typical B'js which is the only reason for the 2 stars.
Erin T.,Venice  CA,17,95,123,9/16/2014,3.0,I love their personal pan pizza. It's always a great lunch special and a great price. It's usually very busy and hard to find parking.
Barbie M.,Westlake  Los Angeles  CA,6,2,,7/17/2014,1.0,Horrible service! Just wanted a pizookie to go and it take about 30 minutes. The hostess seem to busy to care or to help out.
Deisi S.,Los Angeles  CA,17,13,4,6/8/2014,1.0,This is the worst bjs ever!!!!!!.... we were waiting for a booth because I have back problems we waited for an additional 20mins just to find out we were sitting in a regular table. We asked the waiter what happen and she said we were only 3 people not 4!!!!!!!!..... really you would loose customers for a booth..... poor customer service waiters don't care just stand there roll there eyes and give you attitude. .... if you don't have g ood customers service you should be fired..... customers are your check!!!!!!!!
J A.,Pico Rivera  CA,0,2,,1/3/2015,1.0,I was just there last night. The service was horrible. First things first the environment was not me. The host had an attitude never friendly. She had a mad look at all times including an annoying red lipstick. The waitress was so slow. We received food no utensils to eat. Our desert slammed on our table by the idiot kid that ran out the kitchen as if he was in a rush. Seriously do not recommend this BJ's unless you are African American. They will sure give you the best of the best.
Ruth C.,Culver City  CA,7,17,,10/28/2014,5.0,the service was good  the food was good and the waiter looked like by son and even acted like him. It made us giggle every time he walked by. They went out of their way to make us happy  we had ordered something we didn't like and they replaced it without a fuss.
Pier H.,Los Angeles  CA,237,351,127,3/5/2011,4.0,I went here for lunch today with my BF. Initially we were seated at a table for four  but when our server arrived he immediately moved us over to a booth (there were several available). We had the bruschetta appetizer  bbq chicken thin crust pizza  bacon cheeseburger pizza  and chocolate chip pizookie. Maybe they have taken note of all the negative reviews because the service was excellent. Our drinks were quickly refilled and food came promptly. Like another reviewer said  the floor here is very slippery. My BF has a foot injury and has to wear a special foot brace. Between the brace and the smooth floor he wasn't able to get much traction and had to be very careful not to fall over. Besides that  this BJ's location is alright with me.
Pauline D.,Washington  DC,8,69,318,9/28/2014,4.0,Service was great and so was the food. We were in time for late night happy hour which saved us money! BJs is always good
Carmella B.,Atlanta  GA,535,3,,11/21/2015,1.0,"2.5 stars? More like .5 and that\'s only bc our server had a nice smile. My friend ordered the Atlantic salmon and i ordered a simple broccoli cheddar soup and caesar salad. The salmon was dry and overcooked  the medley of vegetables that accompanied the dish were cold (didn\'t seem fresh) almost microwaved....the soup was thicker than I had expected but even worst  my salad had bits and pieces of meat in it  I asked for no meat as it makes me sick. Sidebar  we had also ordered a jalapeo cucumber margarita and Royal soda...this bartender made an even lazier attempt than the cook. Drinks were nothing special  poorly crafted and flat. When brought to the attention of our server  the manager was presented. The manager  Felix then continued to poke and pull apart the salmon explaining that if he puts in another order then ""it will probably come out the same. It won\'t be to your satisfaction."" He then continued in a manner in which he pressured my friend and I to order a different item off of the menu. Of course we didn\'t but that\'s neither here nor there. Customer service means much more than the actual dish. So BJs in Culver City  Westfield mall with Felix as the restaurant manager  you have failed at both. I do not recommend this location."
Jeff E.,Phoenix  AZ,80,80,1,8/19/2014,5.0,For a busy place I was pleased on the time to order and receive our food. Service and food was ver y good!!
Tommy D.,New York  NY,283,197,463,4/8/2010,4.0,So what if it's a chain??? If it's good...I will pretend it's my mother's business and give it high rating! I guess the reason for the low rating here is mostly slow service. That is to be expected at BJ's. Yelping BJ's for slow service is like yelping the DMV for its attentiveness and waiting time. Luckily  we had a big party which we got the special event menu for. Our waiter and his helper were quick to get our drink order and quick to bring the pizzas out. For ~$15 per person (drink  tax  and tip included)  we got unlimited any four kinds of deep-dish pizzas. We chose the veggie  BJ's favorite  mediterranean  and southwestern. At some point during the feeding  the kitchen brought out a BBQ chicken pizza which everyone was excited about. I could tell our pizzas were freshly made and that definitely deserved a star and a cookie. Since it was a per person menu  it took out the hassle of people trying to figure out how much they owed and anyone feeling cheated if he or she overpaid. No pazookie this time because we were so full but we got to take home the pizzas that we didn't finish...which was a lot!
Elizabeth S.,Beverly Hills  CA,141,6,1,11/11/2014,2.0,This only gets 2 because it so happens that I went on a day they were training new people so they weren't very attentive. Other than that  the calamari is great!i tried the spaghetti and shrimp and since I'm allergic to tomatoes and I forgot to let them know and they kindly redid it. :-)
Melissa W.,Los Angeles  CA,117,6,,9/15/2014,1.0,Really the most disappointing meal I've had in awhile. Service was abysmal. Took the server forever to come and take care of us  and it was slow the entire time. Food was mediocre at best  and not only left a bad taste in my mouth but left me hungry at the end. The best part of the meal was the French fries. I wouldn't come here again for work  with friends or with a deal. Shame on the management of this place  poor management in both the front and back of the house.
Sean C.,Fremont  CA,1008,1374,2124,2/5/2013,4.0,"The-e-ee DEEP DISH of the 21st century. Yet in all honesty  it doesn\'t have the oomph that it used to have for me  since discovering ""Stella Rosa "" ""Pitfire"" and ""Birba"" in Palm Springs. Having frequented more than a dozen times  the ""corporate"" menu has changed some -- with unnecessary additions that grates more than it could chew -- but the original essence of their best pizza pies (Sweet Pig  BBQ Chicken  Italian Sausage  Sweet Corn) still reign. When it comes to beers  I love the light ones: Lightswitch Lager  Jeremiah Red  Brewhouse Blonde  Harvest Hefeweizen. The Pazookie is a dessert classic  its a huge cookie and ice cream dollop for two  and I am happy about the choice of different cookies. I still like Vanilla Bean on top."
Allyson E.,Los Angeles  CA,960,418,2154,8/9/2010,4.0,SO NICE INSIDE!! i like the interior and the way its set up alot!!...its smaller than any other bjs ive been too but its nice....GREAT DEALS during HAPPY HOUR!! Best time to gif you want to save some cash and eat alot!!.i got the seasonal drink  Spiked Arnold Palmer....too sweet not my thing  but it got to me.all in all it was good...gonna go soon for some beer tasting with my bu.
Sharonda W.,Greenville  SC,69,72,92,6/13/2012,4.0,"This was the first resturant i recommended to my Friends from out of town.. and Model friends who like too eat lo.. My hubby & I love this place we go probably about 2-3 a month..and my family as well.. are last visit was some week ago and we met a waitress who created her own drink called the ""diva\' it was awesome ..I love the pizza! and parmasean chicken with mash hmmm.. just thiking about it makes me wanna go again!My church Music dept went here for our Christmas gift exchange last year alsoAwesomeness Everytime we go we meet or see a friend or a artist like Thegame for ex and omarion.."
Esteve M.,Los Angeles  CA,90,296,66,6/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Another horrible experience. They just can't get right here. Cold fries. Burger over cooked. And messy. Cold fried jalapeo. Nice manager today. He was caring and apologetic. But I decided to have lunch elsewhere.
Ags P.,Chino  CA,215,254,113,12/7/2012,2.0,I guess I'll be adding onto the countless bad reviews. One would think  with so many bad reviews regarding service  something would be done about it. I guess  on a corporate level  these reviews aren't as highly regarded. Needless to say  it's pretty standard BJ's food  but when it comes down to this particular location  service was horrific. I called in an order  and it was a STRUGGLE to get my order correctly. The employee taking my order would talk to me  and someone else (I'm guessing a server) at the same time. Unbelievably frustrating when I kept asking if the question she was posing was for me. The only reason why my rating is 2 stars  is because by some miracle  my order was correct when I picked it up.
Sonia N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,12/4/2015,2.0,Bad service....didn't get any water  I ordered soup and I didn't even get a spoon or crackers...expensive drinks w a lot of ice a drop of alcohol..not coming anymore..not worthy
Brad H.,Oxnard  CA,0,5,,12/2/2015,5.0,Ok  so the food was ok. It's typical bj's fair. What really warranted the five star rating was my server. His name is VA. He was amazing  ask for him by name! You won't be disappointed!!!
Victor B.,Comanche  TX,1,36,,7/11/2013,3.0,Good service. Nice atmosphere. Sampled four of their label beers and was not impressed with any of the four. The deep dish personal pizza crust was blas but the wedge salad really hit the spot. My recommendation for this place would be to buy bottled beer and pass on the house taps.
Anna T.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,10/21/2015,1.0,Really disappointed. I have had great experiences at BJs before. First time at this location and hosted a private event for my co workers. Was a train wreck. They did not set up for the event of 30 people until we arrived. Btw we were contracted so there is no excuse for their failure to prepare. I was told we were getting a banquet room  but when we showed up we were on the patio. We had to push tables together ourselves and demand more tables and chairs. One server kept standing in the back corner and watching the TV. The other server was instructed to do separate tabs for the alcohol but she made one running tab. It was a nightmare/train wreck. The manager did his best to avoid us. Did I mention we were not provided napkins or enough plates/silverware. I don't usually review places but I am still upset about the lack of care  respect  thought that was shown to myself and my group.
Brandy G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,8,,5/2/2014,1.0,HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Waited over 35 mins for our dinner which came out very cold! My ribeye steak was some thin  burnt  dried out cheap cut of SIRLOIN being MASKED as a RIBEYE STEAK for over $20!! It was so dry and lacked any type of flavor except for the extremely burnt char! Asked for spinach and asparagus for my two sides and was given far beyond less than a normal one portion serving. Literally a tablespoon full of spinach!!!! Additionally  the presentation of my plate was so sloppy! All of it  just terrible!!!!! Save your time and your gas because this food and the horrible service is not worth it! Beyond disappointed!!!! I will never go back!
Laurie M.,Inglewood  CA,72,218,107,4/12/2012,2.0,For some reason I always want to go to BJ's but as soon as I'm there more than 5 minutes I want to gtfo. The service here is terrible! You have to wait a long time to be seated  quite a long time to order  an even longer time to get your food and  finally  an eternity to get the check. Its only saving grace is their pizza. And the pzookies. And maybe their beer sampler. I guess that's 3 saving graces.
Aida A.,Los Angeles  CA,238,25,,4/6/2014,1.0,Well it all started when we messed up and thought yay! BJ's they have great food and beer so we turned around and drove back. Once entering the returning door walked up to an empty hostess counter  when a waitress walked up to use the computer at the podium. She failed to acknowledge us at all was totally focused on something  I waited about a minute and greeted her .. Well hello there 1st thing she Said oh I am sorry I don't work this section I responded by telling her all I wanted was a hi ... Help there how are ... Thanks for coming in... It's key
Darian H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,16,5,11/13/2015,1.0,If I could give a negative star I would. The situation that happened tonight was beyond repair in regards to them receiving our service again. Charles the waiter all the way to Felix the unprofessional manager has set the bar high for customer maltreatment. They served us some soggy undercooked pizza and as a courtesy they are supposed to make another or a different type for the customer not being satisfied and inconvenienced for that matter. Not the case  they only have her a free pazooki and when she wanted a different pizza made right to go  Felix said no problem we will replace the pizza insinuating he wasn't gonna charge but we get the bill and he said we had to pay. Fact of the matter is his language to convey his message was not clear and he literally argued with us WITH his staff annnnddd they gossiped about what happened with other staff in front of the customers (us and other guests)! There is way more that happened in between but the major issue is they have terrible customer service. Had me waiting 15 minutes for some water and argued with customers. NEVER AGAIN not at this location anyway. Save yourselves
Lila B.,Diamond Bar  CA,58,93,294,1/15/2013,4.0,Love the pizza ( supreme) & pizookie's (especially chocolate chunk).... carry on.... lol
James R.,Sunrise  Las Vegas  NV,9,3,,8/3/2014,3.0,Great food but the service is so slow. Waited  Almost 40 minutes for our food after we ordered. Our desert took another 30 minutes. If you have a planned afternoon scheduled  you will need to block 2 hours just to eat here.
Janee M.,Pasadena  CA,41,187,99,12/3/2012,3.0,I have always been a BJ's fan and it never disappoints.. but this one kinda did :(The food never wavers as always which is great.. but the lady I spoke with only the phone about making a reservation was very rude and when I got there I saw her yelling at another employee. Really?? I always say this  but being in the service industry  I know how hard it is. But when you're a hostess  you'e just couldn't be any easier... just be friendly and that's it.Then on top of that  our waiter was whacky! He never looked at us straight in the face or even tilted his chin up at all. He must have been bored because be refilled our drinks like 10 times.. and before they were even half empty!
Travis H.,Fresno  CA,60,429,57,4/25/2014,1.0,This place is miserable! We were there the night of a huge football game and what a joke. Service was terrible  our waiter seemed more interested in who was making a touchdown. Glasses never got refilled and we waited over 30 minutes from placing our order until our salads came out.
JP S.,Los Angeles  CA,109,17,43,7/3/2014,2.0,Service is slow at the bar. We've been here for half an hour and have only ordered drinks. We asked if they had something of menu and I think our waits forgot about us.
Bob S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,9/2/2013,3.0,Food was good but it took forever to get our food and water. They definitely need to improve their service. I LOVE deep dish pizza and tons of different choices of food. Parking is a big hassle there because of the mall. Overall it is OK.
Julissa B.,Los Angeles  CA,90,3,2,9/8/2014,1.0,Doesn't even deserve a 1 star the waiter was very rude. Never even asked how was the food. And to top that off she finally came and asked if we wanted desert and was rushing us while choosing a desert she said are you ordering or not .
Tyler M.,Los Angeles  CA,3,3,8,8/11/2014,4.0,I had the Macaroni and bacon appetizer.... Amazing!!! The Calamari was OK  a little under seasoned  but the white sauce it came with was really good.
Florence L.,Culver City  CA,519,515,209,5/13/2014,4.0,I've been to this BJ's plenty of times and its always been great for me  but I guess I don't come when it's super busy either. The waitress was so awesome to make sure they changed the tv to the Kings game. My bf got their house brown ale and I got a kettle one apple martini. My martini was delish! Good job bartender! I ordered the Cherry chipotle Salmon  which I guess is a new item and seasonal  i think. The bf got the bbq chicken pizza  I was jelly. We had a few beers while watching the game and had a great experience again. They have a large menu and an Allergen menu for me  which is super cool. I'll be back I'm sure and i have no problem with that.
Enisha B.,WOODLAND HLS  CA,106,249,25,1/31/2014,3.0,"I give three stars for the happy hour specials and some of the waitstaff. The bartender was a it rid and much more attentive to her regulars than the rest of us. My friend ordered an old fashioned and asked for lemons  cherries & oranges to be added and she replied ""yeah  that\'s how it\'s always made"". Then she debated with him about this when she brought the drink to him. I ordered a ""slim"" mojito and that was not the case. It tasted super sweet and syrupy so needless to say slim it was NOT. Definitely prefer BJs in Woodland Hills."
Anthony B.,Los Angeles  CA,20,285,102,6/3/2014,3.0,Been here a few times. Consistent with other Bjs I have been too. Decent pizzas and craft beers. I also get the tomato soup and sandwich combos. Its ok.
David h.,Los Angeles  CA,2,54,,6/16/2015,1.0,Traditional BJs service lacks at this location. The kitchen is slow and yes I know it takes a while for pizza. I would not waste my time at this location.
C.M. V.,Long Beach  CA,61,25,1,11/11/2013,1.0,"It seems as though we\'d be echoing all of the comments that mention slow service and the inability of management to compensate for the wait staff. We went for a private party reserved for the patio area. The expectation (seeing as we were there for a reserved patio party) would be that there would be more than enough wait staff assigned to our large party. This was not the case  and the rest of our visit to BJ\'s went downhill from there.* Poor customer service overall. * No one greeted us or offered water to our table. Our table was situated toward a corner of the patio  but was closest to the frequently used exit/entrance of the wait staff. Waitress consistently seemed to make rounds to all other tables except the corner tables. * Arrived at 7:30pm; wasn\'t asked about what we would like to order until 8:45pm. When we did ask for water (since it was never offered to us)  they still NEVER brought it out. * Our order of appetizers took 40 minutes to arrive to our table. Our entrees never arrived  and it was 9:45pm when we decided to leave.* When we approached the front desk to settle our bill for the appetizers that we did receive/eat  we also made a complaint about the poor customer service as well as the poor timing of food served. This is where the management showed their inadequacy and lack of personable customer service. The manager  Mike  said  ""When I went in there  I asked everybody how they were doing  and everyone said they were doing great. I wasn\'t aware that you were not."" A blanket call out to a big party in the patio to ask  ""How\'s everyone doing?"" is not customer service. Between the two of us  we have over 25 years of customer service experience  and a blanket statement never does and never will ""cover"" all the needs of your customers/clients. Mike apologized about not knowing that our needs were not met and that our experience with BJs at that location was poor. His apology was insincere  forced  and rehearsed. He told us that he would talk to the person who was waiting on us. One of the ladies who waited on us (because our original waitress never followed through) walked over with a plastic to-go bag in her hand. It was our entree that never made it to us. Her tone matched Mike\'s tone. We\'re assuming she was a manager or an assistant manager since she was not in a BJs server uniform. Her name is Mecca Tanksly (sp). She said the same thing as Mike stating that she ""asked everyone how they were doing  and everyone said that everything was great!"" Again  we explained to her we shouldn\'t have to explain to her that despite our table being in the corner of the patio  we should not have been overlooked. She interrupted our complaint with lots of acknowledgement filler phrases that were so insincere and completely translated to why their customer service was the way it was. She apologized with this same tone. When we tried to pay for our appetizer  she said she would take care of it. She offered to give us our entree  but we declined as this location definitely left a ""bad taste"" in our mouths. The next day when we spoke to the other guests who were at our table  they said it was a hassle getting our appetizer and entree removed from the table bill because of course BJ\'s did not want to create separate bills for separate guests.*We\'re not asking for anyone to wait on us hand and foot. A simple greet and inventory of our needs when we first arrived would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Bringing water without us having to ask at a restaurant of this ""caliber"" would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Physically walking over to our table and asking the guests at our table (not just shouting into a crowded party of guests) how we were doing and if we needed anything would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Getting our order taken within  say  10-15 minutes of us arriving and being seated would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Receiving our full order within our two and a half hour visit would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. This BJ\'s location lacks the depth of management and wait staff and basic customer service skills to earn another visit or a recommendation from patrons. By the way  we told the second manager that we were avid Yelpers  and we always want to be able to make recommendations for the businesses we patronize. She said  ""Oh  I don\'t even get on Yelp! I don\'t pay attention to that stuff."" Again  they\'re missing the mark if they are clearly not caring about taking the time to read reviews and feedback about their establishment and their service. Maybe  they should rethink checking Yelp! and listening and receiving their patron\'s feedback to continually look for more ways to improve their service and their company\'s reputation. BJ\'s corporate office would certainly be disappointed among other things to hear that their own employees don\'t take time to research ways to improve and deliver quality to patrons."
April M.,Los Angeles  CA,866,70,17,10/15/2011,3.0,Pretty good location. Parking isn't that great  but their Peach Sangria and red velvet pizzoki are amazing!!My server was pretty forgetful (ie: he forgot my water twice / he forgot that I asked for my dessert to go and brought it out on a plate)  and he honestly looked stressed.OH and their floors are soooo slippery!! While we were there this girl bust her ASS on the ground in front of her date! OMG!! Lol *whew* Glad it wasn't me.It's an okay place to go for drinks with friends... just wear non-slip soled shoes.*cheers*
Antonia C.,Los Angeles  CA,5,9,2,3/19/2013,1.0,This BJs blows!!!I've been a fan since I went to one of the first BJs in Laguna Beach  many years ago. Last Friday was my 3rd trip to this location. Husband and I decided we are writing this location off.1st the hostess/ waiting area is chaotic. Wait was longer than estimate given. There are so many employees an Donne of them seem like they are sure about what they are doing or they do not care. There was one hostess who was really sweet and tried to be kind and helpful once we were getting our table. I could not understand a word out of our waiters mouth. He spoke to the ground in a low voice in a crowded loud restaurant and bar. We just assumed what he was saying.Worst parts coming up -Took forever to get our drinks!!!What the heck happened to the deep dish pizza?!!! Our pizza came on a white dish instead of the big black pan. :(  WTH? It looked like a hand tossed pizza  not a deep dish. It tasted doughy and disappointing. Meat toppings were skimpy. Crust was not deep dish. If the pizza here was as good as original BJs used to be  I could get over the other problems here.
Pilar S.,Los Angeles  CA,110,3,2,9/27/2015,1.0,Horrible service  when we arrived we requested a booth and were told that we had to wait  which was understandable so we did. When it was time for us to be seated we were taken to a table not the booth we waited for  we were told that our booth was given away and we had to wait for another one. When we were seated we waited over an hour for our food and when it came it was the wrong order and looked nothing like what was on the menu. The manager eventually came to the table and offered to help and brought back 2 soups and chips and salsa in which the chips were stale when I asked if he could help us out with the bill by at least taking a $10 appetizer off of my $40 bill  he refused and tried to offer me cupons...pshhh like I would ever go back there. I would give this 0 stars if I could.
Marsha S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,10/29/2013,1.0,Do not go to this location if you require service for a large party. They assigned 1 waiter for a large group who seemed to have an attitude. Wonder why? After 30 minutes of sitting with no food  drink  or appetizers  another person (position unknown) came over to our area and began to take orders or maybe to add her two cents. She was not warm  just abrasive and inept. Those people never received their drinks nor their food until she came back to ask  is everything ok? No. We don't have the drinks or food orders you took...If you cannot handle large parties...just say so. That is just not good for business.Please retrain Ricardo and Mecca on customer service.
Jon G.,Los Angeles  CA,65,266,24,7/18/2012,3.0,Came here with my friend the other day. We were basically looking for a place to get food and drinks. I would normally never eat at a mall restaurant  but there really arent a lot of options in this part of town.I had the fish and chips  and my friend had a burger of some sort. Everything was pretty good  and the service was good when we had their attention. Getting that was a different story  but by no means horrible. We split a pitcher of half cider half beer  which was pretty good  and saved us some money since neither of us wanted to spend a ton. We also split a desert. I think our total was about $20 each  so not bad but not great either.It was a bit loud  so talking was difficult. I definitely think they need to make some veggie options  not just salads and onion rings.Overall it wasnt a bad spot  but there really isnt anything spectacular about this place either. I think they are trying to push a brewery gimmick with house deserts. Everything else is pretty standard.
Maya H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,9/22/2014,1.0,We walked in on a Sunday and did not realize this is the place for large after church groups. The host/hostess had no idea what they were doing  they were like scattered chickens with their heads cut off. People were being sat down randomly without any order. After we sat down we waited 15 minutes without any service not even a glass of water from the waiter. We actually walked out and informed the manager about the lack of service and she just shrugged her shoulders. We decided to have lunch next door to Lucille's bbq. This is the place you go to experience slow  rude and absolutely atrocious service.
Carla M.,Hawthorne  CA,0,7,1,9/21/2014,5.0,This restaurant is one of the best! We had amazing sliders  Mediterranean pizza and some wine. The sliders had string fries cooked perfectly. The pizza had Grilled chicken breast  basil pesto  roasted garlic  Kalamata olives  sun-dried and seasoned feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. AMAZING!
Scott G.,Los Angeles  CA,102,133,27,5/1/2014,1.0,Let me start by saying I love OTHER BJ's but this one is TERRIBLE! There's something seriously going wrong with this particular one with the quality of food  there must be some kind of BJ's corprate quality control or protocol that they are completely disregarding. I ordered a burger medium and it came PAST well done and more sad and flat than a McDonald's burger- I sent it back but it came back only slightly better but still flat and sad! My Mom ordered a Cobb salad and it looked like 99.8% lettuce and .2% of the good stuff. It was so bad i'll never go back ever to this BJ's. All the other one's I've been to were great  someone needs to call Corporate because this place is giving a bad name to all other BJ's :(
Tim R.,Los Angeles  CA,206,85,14,5/12/2014,4.0,"The service was very prompt and polite. I will not  however  order the Chicken Lettuce Wrap appetizer again. While I understand it is an ""appetizer "" and not a meal  for $10 I expect a little more than a soup cup full of the chicken/chestnut/ onion /celery mix that makes up the lettuce wrap. It was facetious to give us 7 large lettuce leaves when the mix only made 2 modest wraps"
Ina G.,Santa Ana  CA,0,20,4,7/6/2014,1.0,Terrible experience waited 1 hour to get seated they took 2 hours to serve are food. When my family member received his food it was cold.....terrible experience I won't be going their again........stay away... This place gave me a bad taste in my mouth......stay away...
Dragoness L.,Los Angeles  CA,2,23,,9/9/2011,2.0,In by 9:00..out by 11:48. Last night was my 20th birthday. As it was mid-week  my sister and I decided to hold off until the weekend to really celebrate but we still wanted to go out and enjoy a nice meal. I wavered between the Rainbow Bar & Grill  Houston's and BJ's. But  I'd been hearing about BJ's for years now and a lot more since this location opened its doors so I decided to go there. We finally walk in at 9:00 after arriving at the mall about 10 mins prior. The 10 minutes was spent trying to find parking within a reasonable distance. When first make our way through the revolving doors the rather dry hostess summons a server who directs us to our seats. We're then lead  (at a run) to the other side of the restaurant. The floor was slippery and--since I had on heels--very difficult to navigate. (I am not exaggerating  we actually witnessed our waitress and one patron slip and fall at separate times during the night.)After we're seated--quite out of breath from the jog we'd just been lead on might I add-- we're greeted by a waitress (Whom will be referred to as Rihanna's Forehead  or RF) who hands us out menus and disappears. She appears 15 minutes later to take our drink and appetizer orders. We then waited another 20 more minutes for the simple drinks and appetizers to arrive. Then  a chipper waitress named Nadia finally arrived with our drinks...but not the food. After handing us our drinks  she looks confused when we ask about our meals. She had no idea we even ordered anything. There is some discussion  some skepticism and some fact checking and Nadia returns with a manager. We explain that we ordered our food by now nearly an hour ago and had seen neither hide nor hair of it since then. RF  our original waitress returns moments later  as if on cue with our orders. We were grateful  the manager (a friendly older blonde woman) apologized and skirted off. Shortly  we realized the food was cold. My sister's burger was hard and room temp at best and my chicken fried steak was more chicken fried ..breaded greasy mess. My mashed potatoes were downright icy and my other sides weren't even on the plate.We spoke with RF after calling over a busboy and attempting to locate her. She apologized  brought out my veggies and more mashed potatoes and took my sister's burger away  obviously to be microwaved. I tasted my food. Both the steak and the mashed potatoes were were bland but somehow over-peppered. I thought the fact that there was cheese in the mash would have saved it but all it did was make it a cheesy  peppery mess. NEVER AGAIN.
Winston G.,Chicago  IL,366,770,18,7/15/2010,3.0,3.5 stars.Good service  decent food - I like their wings and their California club sandwich. TVs all around  so a good play for sporting events - watched the World Cup final here this past weekend. I'm going to assume Sunday lunch time is not as busy as some of the other reviews have mentioned. Location is good  right at the Fox Hills Mall. You can valet ($5) or park on your own...
Bri W.,Los Angeles  CA,53,40,,6/15/2012,4.0,The worst thing about this place was that we came during one of the games where the Kings were loosing. In my Kings jersey I was psyched to be there and hopefully watch them win  unfortunately they didn't but ultimately they still won later.The food was actually very good and it was one of the few times I couldn't finish my food. I had some mushroom burger and my bf had the Cajun jambalaya - both delicious. The service was ehhh. Out server went on break halfway through so we kept having to call other servers to refill drinks  bring to-go boxes  and get the check. Overall it was pretty fun to be in the environment with lots of Kings fans and just having a good time.
Shannon C.,Albuquerque  NM,799,628,1208,12/17/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Brunch is horrible. $6 for white toast and cold scrambled eggs. $8 for a decent mimosa  though.
Jameela F.,Los Angeles  CA,200,3,,7/22/2014,1.0,Worst service on a Tuesday night consistently. 30 min just to tk our order. I attend a business meeting across the street and will go to BJs after. Meals come b4 ur appetizers  food is cold and it takes forever to get served. I am in the restaurant now. And i was even polite when i complained. ..no urgency. .very disappointing
Christine Y.,Los Angeles  CA,388,532,509,10/14/2009,2.0,The other location in Westwood is better. Well maybe it's just opening bugs  but I docked stars for the food also. Service-Okay bordering on spotty. The wait was estimated 45 minutes  but it turned out to be 25  which is much better. Waiter was nice  but wasn't round much. I was left wondering if we even had one when he didn't come around at first. He basically did the usual stops.Atmosphere-like the other BJ's but more room. The bathroom was out of toilet paper though and had water all over the floor. Bad if the bathroom isn't nice and clean and kept up.Food- Ordered the BJ's fave deep dish pizza and the garden medley salad. Pizza was okay  wasn't too bad  but I wish it had more toppings on it. Salad was most horrible salad I've ever had in years from a restaurant. Yea  so BJ's isn't known for salads  but I figure their other stuff is good and usually loaded with stuff  so prolly the salad is the same way. 9 dollars for slightly wilted browning lettuce that probably came out of a bag  some chopped tomatoes  feta cheese  red peppers  red onion  and then 3 small pieces of artichokes  and vinagrette. A very very sad salad  portion wasn't huge  was decent but I can't believe how bad it was. If they have it on their menu  they should at least use fresher ingredients and put more into their salad! Other restaurants that don't specialize in salad do a much better job and at least chop their own lettuce. And thats that. I hope the service and everything gets better once they have been open longer.
Keirsten A.,Bishop  CA,0,9,1,7/19/2015,2.0,Slow  rude service. We watched two tables get their food and finish while we still waited. Our server was pushy about us paying the bill before we even got our food. Not impressed
Jeff H.,Los Angeles  CA,469,463,1261,11/3/2009,1.0,Same great tasting BJ's food and good lunch menu prices. Standard BJ's ambiance + decor. BUT truly horrible food delivery time. It's sad that the manager must be involved at every experience we've had here. To be fair  the manager did make amends by comping one of our lunch items.Don't go here if you have a short lunch break. It will take more than one hour guaranteed.I really want this location to improve  would eat here once a week easily.
Justin B.,Los Angeles  CA,90,130,401,2/14/2010,3.0,Came in here for a friends 21st Birthday Party and it turned out to be a pretty nice time. I had never been here so I was of course suspect  but it was a pretty nice looking place (though it better be  its brand new!) We had a party of about 15 people and called ahead same day to make the reservation. Our waiter was definitely working the ladies at the table for a large tip  even though an 18% gratuity was added on due to the size of our party.I started out with a Long Island  as usual  while we were waiting for more of the guests to show their faces. needless to say  it held me over quite nicely till more people arrived and we started ordering food. By that time i had finished it so I ordered another along with a Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich with steak fries (potato skins) The pork was pretty good  very juicy but not as full of flavor as i would have liked. The steak fries were perfect though and i could have eaten a lot more of those.My individual bill came out to about $25-30 for my two drinks and sandwich. our bill for the whole party.. well that was pretty large haha  but i have to say it was a pretty nice place to have our friends 21st b-day dinner. A-OK!
Angel M.,Compton  CA,31,69,19,11/10/2013,2.0,Never again....I should have known better. My first experience at this BJ's was also poor! And how does a large chain like this run out of butter?
Sean B.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,9/9/2013,1.0,Horrible service!!!!!!!! As I wrote this at 10:05pm my family & I are still waiting for our food!!! Our waitress keeps on passing by without giving us refills on our water hasn't not been back to let us know why the long wait when it's clearly that this bullshit ass place is pretty empty it doesn't make any sense.Honestly I do not recommend this location to anyone!! But before I leave I will be speaking to a manager!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alex W.,Hawthorne  CA,65,12,2,9/22/2011,1.0,"We were deciding between BJ\'s and Lucilles... gf wanted pizza so we decided to check it out. We waited for 10 minutes to be seated  expected. But what we did not expect was for the waiter to take 5 minutes to get to us  then after we ordered avocado rolls and pizza  the ""appetizer"" should have came to us. After 30 minutes  we had to ask one of the waiters where our food was. 5 minutes later  he comes out to apologize. When we got our pizza 40 minutes later  we had already asked one of the other waiters to cancel our appetizer  then our waiter comes to our table and INSISTS that we reconsider  as in he asked us ""are you SURE you didn\'t want the avocado rolls?"" My gf and I were not too happy about this  and we just said no politely  even though both of us were visibly upset. He even had the nerve to ask us TWICE  as if we made a mistake. It just made us feel bad.  And the people around us got their food a long time later too. The fact that he tried to get us to accept the 40 minute appetizer was insulting  and typically when something like this happens other restaurants offer somethign on the house or apologize  but he gave us a guilt trip by saying how he had to go cancel it now and it was the chef\'s fault for making it so late and he didn\'t know what was going on. It doesn\'t take 35 minutes to apologize for the food not coming. And to top it off  they made us wait another 20 minutes after finishing our pazookie to give us the check. I paid in cash and gave a 4 dollar tip  which was quite generous. I\'m usually a big tipper  so to have me tip barely 10% means you did something wrong. I\'ve been to other BJ\'s before  but this is the first and last time I\'m going to this one. No wonder it has 2 stars on Yelp.Oh yeah  and we never got a refill on our drinks. We just wanted to get out of there quickly."
Stephanie R.,Aliso Viejo  CA,54,142,930,3/31/2014,1.0,Disappointed with this BJs  service was horrible the food is all greasy not to mention the prices are to much for the greasy food you receive. The happier hour menu is not a happy hour menu but a greasy selection with high calories. The Draft beer selection is the only thing worth will therefore my recommendation is go somewhere else and save your time and $.
Angel C.,Los Angeles  CA,30,27,16,6/12/2014,4.0,I love this place  yes it's a bit ghetto  but once you get over it it's a cool place to watch games and grab something to eat.. I love the beer selection. Oh and I hate the parking spaces.
Luke D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,17,,8/15/2014,5.0,Vibe: Clean and nice looking restaurant. Service: I've been more than 5 times and only once did we have a low quality serve. Last night we had a very attentive and quick server for a family birthday.Food: Pizza's are awesome  especially the 5 meat  chicken ranch  and Mediterranean. Avacado egg rolls are a new favorite app. Price: Higher than some chains but better quality food and atmosphere. Worth it.
Anaher B.,Los Angeles  CA,1,142,,5/11/2015,3.0,Came here with a friend  food was okay decent. I probably wouldn't go here often just not my type of scene or menu I suppose. Service was okay  the lady was a little rude but otherwise it was decent.
Phoenicia H.,Los Angeles  CA,18,4,,11/10/2014,1.0,Once again  BJ's has let me down. I can honestly say that if I could give zero stars I would  but the star is for our waitress. I went here with a group of 10 people  and without a reservation  we were seated pretty quickly. The staff was very considerate  considering we didn't make a reservation. After being seated  my friend and I decided to sample their beers. Our waitress was very nice (I can't remember her name)  and she kept up with us even though we were all over the place. After taking our orders  we waited the standard amount of time  around 10-15 minutes  for our food to be brought out. My friend and her sister ordered the wings  and on our tables first bites  we realized the wings were not only cold  but they were undercooked!!! Our waitress apologized several times  and brought us new wings  that were fresh from the fryer. I ordered the crispy potatoe skins  which were good  but nothing to write home about. Another person who was with us ordered wings for her meal  and her wings were cold as well. The waitress apologized once more  and brought new wings out again. At this point  I was so done with this place  and I realized why I didn't like it...it's overrated and disgusting. After leaving  my friend and I were literally sick to our stomachs. Oh yeah  my friend's mother found a piece of plastic in her food. I don't think I will be going to BJs in the future.
Claudia Y.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,4/3/2013,1.0,I came here to celebrate my sons 16th b day !!!!! And to my disappointment  the food wasn't that good and the worst part we waited a long time to get sitted n the service was terrible the waiters couldn't handle the volume of customers...not coming here ever again
Arlene T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,2,12/1/2014,1.0,Ok I have tried and tried to give this place a 4th and now 5th chance to rectify their mistakes. Only because this place is closest to work and home. Dining in  ordering for pickup/curbside and today walking in to the bar and ordering ... Each and every time our orders are WRONG. Someone did not put in an order. Someone misplaced our order. Only to finally receive the food and have it be incorrect. And the nerve of the employees to have a bad attitude when asked to correct the order.
Aaron M.,San Francisco  CA,317,759,78,12/2/2009,4.0,"Whoa why people be hatin on the BJs?They are known for their red beer and pizookie but really the \'za is where it\'s at. We got the ""BJs classic combo"" which i think was pepperoni  sausage and shrooms  and it was medium holyshitorgasmic good. They put butter AND sugar in that pizza dough or something. It was so good that we got fresh pizza the next day  but the reheated BJs was better. Yeah  really  sloppy second BJs are better than non-BJs. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was pretty solid also - but watch out - they put cheese on it unannounced!I love the hate this location is getting in their reviews. Something like ""I hate that it is so good that it is so popular that I had to wait a long time."" Um  OK."
Craig H.,Santa Monica  CA,3,14,,3/17/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Well with our office only a mile or so up the hill we have tried BJ's time and again. While the food quality is ok  they just cannot serve an efficient lunch or get any order right. In fact the last time we went last Wednesday was the worst you could imagine. My law partner got the soup and salad and I got a turkey burger with a few changes as to the toppings. My law partner got his soup and salad before mine  which is fine  but twice I was assured that my turkey burger was coming out soon. After waiting 45 minutes the waitress asked if my law partner would like another salad and he said he did but not until my food came out. The manager then brought out my turkey burger but would not answer our question as to what went wrong. Even worse  the waitress never came back to get my lunch companion to get his salad. And when I got the bill they only took my lunch off but not my law partner's who waited forever for my lunch and did not get the rest of his. We left a small tip and left. And never to be back again. This has occurred time and time again and the kitchen and wait staff are unable to serve a business lunch where we can get back in an hour. We drive 15 minutes each way to La Dijonnaise and get our much better and less expensive lunch and are back before an hour passes. BJ's Culver City is a disgrace. My law partner was so offended that his lunch was not free after having to wait for an hour for me to eat. Outrageous.
Hassan W.,Inglewood  CA,100,17,4,9/27/2013,1.0,Came to get food and leaving. Service was horrible. DO NOT GET waitress Pippa is horrible. I sat in my seat and received no service for about 30 min and was never asked if I wanted water or anything. When I usually come I usually use the waiter Patrick and this is the first time that I sat in here section and must say was so bad that I didn't even order and left Restaurant hungry and irritated with my guest.
Diana S.,Los Angeles  CA,2,10,,9/24/2012,3.0,My hubby and I tried it last week  we wanted a place with good ambiance. Food is ok  get the beer my drink was watered down  the Pzookie's are good. Our waiter really seemed like he was in a bad mood. We got the 2 for $20 deal. That is why I gave it 3 stars. Parking sucks at this mall.
Jason R.,Visalia  CA,93,123,265,3/24/2010,3.0,Good place to watch the game. Any game. Lots of TV's  good beers  happy hour specials. Great for groups and kids.The food is ehhh. My burger was good  but didn't really blow me away. I'd come back  but it'd be for happy hour while watching some sort of sports game.
Jesse W.,Los Angeles  CA,46,9,15,10/7/2014,1.0,"I\'ve been here on several different occasions and each time the service is slower than the last. This isn\'t reason enough to give such a low rating typically but tonight\'s experience was the most irritating. We ordered take out and showed up approximately 20 minutes later  I was anticipating a wait. We soon discover our order was not put in and have to wait for our order  now sitting in the waiting area thus negating calling ahead for take out. Also the worker at the take it desk did nothing to figure out what happened to our order we spoke to a man on the phone and all the lady did to ""assist"" was say ""no men are working here tonight"". We discovered shortly after that the already hard to believe statement that not one single man worked at that location was false as we saw several men walking around the location working. Finally got the food and hastily went home only to find out they didn\'t put the correct toppings on my burger. Never returning to this Bjs location  the last straw for me."
Cel J.,Los Angeles  CA,312,425,1296,6/11/2012,3.0,came here for early dinner and to watch the nba finals.got seated right away...-server was very friendly....BUT our order took forever to come!--and they had our appetizers wrong...so waited longer...i think this was the LONGEST i ever waited on my food to come...been to ther Bj's...---this was the slowest service ever!
Mr. Travon B.,Hawthorne  CA,10,33,30,3/21/2014,1.0,"I came to BJ\'s with some friends of mine before my flight to New York. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Pasta. As I waited on my meal to come  the server brought the out drinks out then right after proceeded to bring our meals out. My meal was bland and with no CHICKEN!! I told the server that my meal didn\'t have the grilled chicken and he said he would come back with it. 25 minutes passed and still no chicken. Once the waiter came back to the table I gave him back the plate his response was ""Oh they didn\'t bring the chicken out"" NO! There was no chicken and NO there was no apology. Pooooo"
Kye T.,Westchester / LAX  Los Angeles  CA,157,59,11,3/7/2015,4.0,"I love B.J\'s! I was excited to go back after so long. They\'ve always had really good pizza and this is one of the only two places I order beer. Their Double Berry cider is so yummy! It\'s a mix of Berry Punch Cider and Frambroise & it doesn\'t even taste like beer! We tried the Loaded Potato Wedges which were tasty and my favorite  a medium size Chicken Bacon Ranch. The crust on their pizzas is too die for  so crispy and you can taste garlic. My son had the ""Create your Own"" meal. His corn dogs and French fries were standard but he did get a good helping of each. The only qualm we have is with the service. I stepped away to the bathroom minutes before my name was called to be seated. I was away for less than 5 minutes and they gave my table away! No apology was given either. We also ordered a drink that never came & it took forever for us to get our bill and cash out. Another server actually had to take our check from us. Other than that  the food was great but I hope we have a more attentive server next time."
Debbie C.,Hawkins  TX,4,32,,4/21/2014,4.0,My husband and I decided to try BJ's for dinner and we had a great experience. Our server was fantastic!! Her name is Taj (like Taj Mahal). She was so great and attentive. The food was very good  atmosphere was nice...all in all it was very pleasant and we're happy we finally went!
tae k.,Rancho Palos Verdes  CA,158,805,6,2/24/2010,4.0,This is a new BJs that opened recently since the renovation of the Fox Hills mall to a Westfield. I have been here twice. Lots of space. TV's everywhere. The staff is friendly but I would avoid it when it is busy.Good selection of brews. My favorite is the Jeremiah Red.I've had the BBQ Chix and the Spinach & Artichoke. The BBQ was good but the Spinach & Art was bland. The pizookie makes it
Micole C.,Los Angeles  CA,47,230,45,10/29/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Went back 2 days ago in actual restaurant..and womppp..so short & to the pointmy friend said her lettuce was old lol i know it sounds crazy but she had to send it back.my lettuce in my salad was extra soggy but im more tolerable than hereI had the cajun pasta that was really bland...i really expected and explosion of flavors but i was wrong.the worst..the waitress..we literally had to hunt her down to ask for things..whenever we did finally come across her and ask for things she would come back without them ! my friend literally after asking our waitress twice for lemons and her returning twice without lemons...had to walk over to the bar and asked for a plate of lemons smh.. i may give this place one more chance but i surely can pass on it
Dan P.,Seattle  WA,380,617,230,4/22/2012,3.0,This is in the mall. Parking is a pain so I usually end up parking in the structure or valet.The food is fairly typical of the BJ's chain. It's not bad but not necessarily good either. Our server was fine and attentive.
Joey C.,Culver City  CA,0,10,,6/2/2011,2.0,Okay  firstly  A+ on everything. The food is AMAZING. It's moderately priced. It's a good atmosphere  as good as a sports bar in the fox hills mall can be  and the staff is SO NICE.BUTI hate the managers of this place so much  with such a fat passion. They've created of policy of carding ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE NO MATTER WHAT. This really sucks. I NEVER EVER EVER get carded. NEVER. It's been years. You know why? Because I look old. I look VERY old  to the point where on multiple occasions people have mistook my girlfriend for my daughter. But  religiously  no matter how many times I come here I get carded. This sucks because sometimes I come from the gym or am late to meet a buddy here  and I don't like to carry excessive stuff in my pockets  like an ID I never have to whip out because I look so old. So many times I've either had to walk all the way to my car or not order beer.I don't know if this is a corporate policy or what but it really ruins my experience. Come on guys  at SOME POINT common sense HAS to trump corporate policy. Otherwise  there is just no point in human civilization.
Paula D.,Flagstaff  AZ,127,459,204,2/9/2010,4.0,We like BJ's Brewhouse! We came here for Super Bowl Sunday to root on the New Orleans Saints. Yay! We ordered cocktails to start  Strawberry Splash  Washington Apple (Yum!)  and BJ's Top Shelf Margarita  then a pitcher of Samuel Adams. We had the Garden Medley Salad - a huge salad  very tasty and the feta cheese on top was really soft and tasty  made the whole salad irresitable. Then we ordered the Best Beginings Appetizer Combo - the Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls wer so good! We also ordered the Piranha Pale Ale Nachos. We asked if the jalapenos were hot. They were not so we requested hot sauce. When we got to the bottom of the pile the chili was really good. Next time I am ordering extra chili on top.What is it with jalapenos lately? They have no spice  no flavor  in fact  I am finding them to be a bit sweet. We want HOT jalapenos!! If not  then start cutting some yellow chili or habeneros! It's ridiculous that I have not had a decent jalapeno in so long when ordered.Everything at BJ's was nice. We were seated in 10 minutes. They gave us a booth that was behind the big screen then we requested another table that was in the middle and all the teles were visible. We were happy. I like the way the hostess was nice and friendly. Didn't smile much but friendly upon approach.We want to go back and try the pizzas. They looked really good.We also want to try the Sunday Brunch one of these Sundays.
Chuck H.,Redmond  WA,43,34,,6/26/2013,1.0,"Worst service of any BJ\'s I\'ve ever been to. 45 minutes for a soup and salad? That\'s not ""unlimited"" by any reasonable definition. Manager was surly and unhelpful. Terrible staff  terrible excuses  didn\'t comp anything despite a spectacularly crappy performance."
Eric M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,27,3,5/30/2014,4.0,We've been here a couple of times and both of our visits were great. We had a waitress (Taj) our first visit and she was very attentive  even though it was busy. Our second visit was almost a mirror of the first and that was on Mother's Day! Great service  great food and decent prices. We'll be back!
Roger L.,Lancaster  CA,0,2,,7/2/2015,5.0,Our waiter  Brian  did a great job to make us feel welcome. His suggestions on the menu were spot on. We loved the food. Overall  it was a very positive experience. It's great to see someone who goes above and beyond to provide the best service possible. Great job Brian.
Mark M.,Los Angeles  CA,41,16,2,7/10/2013,2.0,Ok I shouldn't complain but the server was training a new guy and when it all came down they did the best they could of. I like the Thai Shrimp Wraps they dd taste good but I had to wait 30mins for the food and the Salmon my wife ordered looked like it had fallen off the plate and they tried to pass it for ok. I did have to have them remake her dish but after they did the salmon was almost perfect (just needed more spice for my wife's liking).
Jazmyn A.,Lancaster  CA,2,17,5,12/6/2013,1.0,"The server\'s name is Steven and he is hispanic  he was the last person to have access to my card as well as my friend\'s card which was charged. Be aware!I wish I could give this negative stars. DO NOT GO TO THIS BJ\'S. They had shady employee\'s who like to 1. charge your card for 1 amount 5 times. 2. Charge a different amount a few more times 3. Wait until you leave to charge the card again for another amount (the manager admitted that there was no signature for the charge) 4. steal your card information and go on a spending spree after work. BJ\'s HAS NOT made an effort to reverse these charges as they ""still looking into it"" The Bank statements don\'t lie. DO NOT EAT HERE  DO NOT USE YOUR CARD HERE  AND DO NOT TRUST THE SHADY ASS PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING YOU! THE MANAGEMENT SUCKS AND THEY NEED TO DO BETTER. I wouldn\'t care if BJs went out of business from this particular location. This is the second poor experience I\'ve had with BJ\'s as a company and I will continue to spread the news. The BBB is next. DO NOT TRUST THAT LOCATION."
Heidy R.,Carson  CA,1,38,,7/17/2012,1.0,I give the the restaurant a one star. but our waitress 10 stars if I could. Her name was Kaiya? i believe. Well let me tell you. Me and my coworkers waited for about an hour and nobody had come to attend us  not even ask for our drinks. It was around 11pm  we had just gotten off of work and were starved and after that long wait we were extremely irritated. We had discussed how whoever was gonna be our waitress wasnt gonna get a tip  and we were gonna complain. But then Kaiya showed up  and saved the day. Even with us showing her our frustration  she was able to turn the whole situation and apologized for the mixup. She handled the situation very well  and put all of us at ease. She was truly amazing and got our orders in ASAP after all that wait. Her customer service was above and beyond and we appreciated it and we actually changed our minds about the no tipping :D....Now...the time before that..we came with a group of 8  which means the tip was already included. The guy that helped us was extremely rude to us [probably because he knew his tip was already there] ..so my recommendation ask for kaiya or dont show up in a group of eight..and parking sucks butt here.
Rory C.,Alpharetta  GA,5,11,,3/25/2014,5.0,Went there and had a great experience. We had a server  Britt  who is clearly a gem and someone this place should hold on to. She knew her stuff and was on top of every strange request we had. Will definitely return and request her again as our server. Also pizookies are amazing
Patty O.,Los Angeles  CA,15,416,,1/10/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Well like I said in my first review  I would give BJ's another chance when it was less crowded. Last night we went for a late dinner...not crowded at all...got a seat in a booth right away. The hostess and waitress were great-very attentive & took our drink & food order immediately. Then the wait...and wait and wait. It wasn't crowded at all but it took about 30 minutes for our small pizza to come out. And after all that  the pizza came out wrong. It wasn't how we ordered it. The waiter apologized but at that point  I was not going to wait another minute to eat after already waiting 30 minutes (it was 9pm). I won't be back anytime soon.
Rachel S.,Los Angeles  CA,254,118,80,1/13/2012,2.0,The food is edible. I wouldn't come here out of my own will only if I'm invited for a 21st Birthday or something. I've had better  and would rather go to a mom & pop shop than a corporate owned restaurant that has high amounts of sodium in everything. I did leave very bloated thanks to the salt and stayed that way until the next morning.
Eliana A.,Palos Verdes Peninsula  CA,11,19,3,6/6/2011,1.0,"W O W... There was a punkish styled overweight girl with black hair in the front  I suppose she was a hostess  she had a SKELETON hair clip in June on her head  and she was extremely rude. She didn\'t even look up at me and my coworkers as we walked in. Then she finally looked up and said ""I hope you\'re ready to wait."" I don\'t understand why some people are in this business if they have a ""I hate my life"" look on their face and treat people like dirt while they are working. This is a business! I am PAYING for a service! and YOU my dear are lucky you have a JOB!I was just apalled by her attidue and by her appearance. Ugh.. well I must say that food was good  but i\'ll never patronize that specific BJ\'s again."
Nolan A.,Marina Del Rey  CA,0,30,6,5/9/2014,1.0,Never again. And we used to like BJ's. Such a shame this was handled incorrectly by the manager Andrew; hence this review.We went here today for lunch on 5/9/14 and got a nice BIG shiny piece of packaging in my caesar salad. Almost a 1/4 of the size of the salad.I mean this thing was HUGE... 4 inches x 2 inches... and metalic on one side and white on the other. Had I bit into this  I surely would have had some mouth injuries  let alone swallowed a piece of it. Thank God it was a LARGE piece and I easily found it.So regardless of the Kitchen oversight  the manager never apologized  never came over to the table to explain and offer anything except taking the entree off the bill.REALLY?!?! I get a big piece of metal and plastic in my salad and all you do is bring me another one? What the hell kind of restaurant is this? Did you really think I wanted another salad after your restaurant horribly decided to ruin a customer's appetite? I'm just sorry I didn't take a picture of it for all the other yelpers (I was without my phone).I think not and I'll never be back to another BJ's. Time to remove ourselves from the restaurant chains... it's all about the family owned where this kind of stuff doesn't happen... AND if it ever does (would be a first for us)  the manager comps the whole meal  offers deserts  entrees  coupons  whatever else in his power  and legitimately tries to fix the problem and make their customers happy.We received no such response from this manager. Grade: F
Danielle W.,Bellflower  CA,7,6,3,4/9/2014,1.0,This place right here just pisses me off I try to give this place a chance ONE MORE TIME and they blew it if it wasn't for the manager of this place it would have got real ugly our first waiter was coming too the ending of his shift introduced us to our new waitress and that's when all the problems started she forgot we have more food coming out the kitchen we waited sooooooooo long for our food it was cold then she NEVER checked on us no refills for us cold food and when it's time to go we waited to 20mins for a check and 20mins for it to return we wasted OUR WHOLE DAY NEVER AGAIN
Rosie O.,Culver City  CA,3,33,28,8/7/2012,4.0,We've had a good time eating at this restaurant and they are very family friendly! At times service can be slow but I'm usually there when you expect it to be busy Lunchtime and dinner time. The wait is usually not that long I think the longest we have waited is 20 minutes. I have not had any problems with food everything that I have ordered has worked well for us. My only complaint is the kids Kraft mac and cheese we order him a side of the gourmet mac and cheese that is freshly made!
Nipa S.,Los Angeles  CA,14,31,1,3/12/2014,3.0,Food was really good and parking is no problem. Pizookies were delish! Definitely would have rated higher of the service wasn't so bad. Recommend If you don't mind chappy service and/or want some good grub.
Pegah Y.,Washington  DC,1431,2209,5529,2/27/2011,1.0,"This is the second ""1"" star that i\'ve ever given  and I don\'t think it deserves even one star. The experience at this BJ\'s was terrible. I have been to other BJ\'s and every other BJ\'s experience has been excellent. However  this BJ\'s is just absolutely terrible... I came here with a friend to celebrate her med school acceptance. We were really excited for a night out. She ordered a pizza and I ordered a large clam chowder soup. The soup ended up coming in a very small cup! I asked if taht was a large and they said that it was. I can\'t even imagine what the small cup would look like. But it didn\'t stop there - I couldn\'t even eat the soup! It was EXTREMELY salty. It tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of salt in there. My friend\'s pizza was much smaller than that size of pizza usually is at the other BJs.We decided to get a pizookie and hoped that it would be better  but it was an extremely small pizookie! I\'ve had pizookies from the other BJs dozens of times and have loved it every time  but this pizookie was very small! All the portions at this BJs were small! The service was absolutely terrible! it took a while for us to be served and when I told them my soup was too salty  they switched it out but it was still salty when they brought it back! I really don\'t think that this is representative of BJ\'s restaurants in general. In fact  my very next review is going to be about the BJ\'s in Westwood  which is absolutely excellent and which I\'ve been going to for years. But DO NOT go to the BJ\'s in Culver City. It\'s seriously terrible and will most likely be a big waste of your time and money."
Irene V.,Los Angeles  CA,18,23,7,8/10/2013,1.0,I have been to BJ's before and have never had an issue. At this particular location I had a really bad experience and really bad customer service. Im very dissapointed because overall I enjoy this restaurant for casual dinner. Me and my boyfriend were quickly seated. No waiter approched us to offer drinks or appetizers.After waiting about 30 miniutes I ask a bus boy to please send a waiter since we were ready to order. After waiting another 10 mins no one comes to our table so we get up and leave. I understand its saturday and you are busy but every customer is important. I would have a appreciated at least a glass of water..and just let me know your running late!
Tim L.,Irvine  CA,115,33,8,1/28/2010,4.0,Great if you're needing to get away from the office for a bit. Happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7pm. Half off mini pizzas  $2 off appitisers  and $1 off draft beers. Come right at 3 and it's not that busy. If you're going to have a late lunch  do it here.
Daniel B.,Huntington Park  CA,30,137,13,10/8/2013,5.0,Came here with 6 college amigos. We had the BBQ pizza and the Buffalo chicken pizza along with two pitchers of Oasis amber. Good times  good times...
Ellen S.,Los Angeles  CA,28,86,,7/1/2011,1.0,"Always seems like a good idea to go - I LOVE chain sports bars like this - but this one is BAD. Never ends up being a good idea. The food is ok  but sooo overpriced. And their ""specialty drinks"" should be called ""especially WEAK drinks.""Usually  the service so bad that it doesn\'t even really make me crabby  it just makes me laugh."
Carli B.,Torrance  CA,19,71,19,9/2/2013,1.0,If it was possible to give this place negative stars I totally would. I came here with a couple of friends after going to a zombie walk. I was still in my zombie get up when arriving here. After waiting 10 min to be seated we were escorted to table that was in the very back and then we sat down  waited to get an order of drinks but no one came. There was a waiter at the table across from us that had gone back and fourth 4 or 5 times and never once stopped to ask if we'd been helped. We ended up walking out and going to the Olive Garden next door and got great service. I've never been treated so poorly as a willing and paying customer before.
Marcelle H.,Sherman Oaks  CA,22,140,19,3/19/2011,2.0,Food = mehService = eh?Imagine if Denny's launched a sports bar franchise. That sums it up completely  but if you want to read further  feel free. BJ's is a fine place to meet someone with young kids - no need to worry about being loud or spilling things. The food is ok if you want something deep fried or dipped in ranch dressing. And the 3-year-old I meet here once a month always enjoys her fries and chicken tenders. She also likes the kid's menu and crayons. Her mom and I usually just pick at our food while we talk. Today I decided to try brunch. The home-style potatoes were deep fried and there were no onions  peppers  or any other vegetables mixed in. Pretty much they were just cube-shaped french fries with some sort of seasoning salt. The scrambled eggs were over-cooked and crispy on the outside. The wheat toast was good  but was served without butter or jam. There was nothing else on my plate - just three tan piles of food.The servers make a show of speaking very polite and formal as if your wish is their command  but I always have to ask for essentials  and wait  and wait. The coffee was served not in a mug but in a bar glass because they were out of mugs  and they didn't bring spoons even though we requested cream and sugar. I did eventually get someone to bring us some jam for my toast  and ketchup - and the water we asked for when we first sat down. I guess for the price  it's acceptable  and this is why I gave it two stars instead of one.
Nathalie C.,Santa Monica  CA,209,124,,2/24/2011,2.0,We had a huge group of people for dinner and when my friend was making a reservation they were extremely sassy about taking us. First  all but two of our group were 21  we were going to be spending a lot of money on both drinks and food  so they should have been so happy to take us. When we arrived (with reservations) we had to wait a bit before we were actually seated. I understand it was a Friday night and we were a big group so I'll let that slide. Once we were seated our waiter and waitress were really nice but they seemed to be really flustered the whole time. They messed up orders  brought the wrong food... I could tell they were trying hard and we were not the easiest group of people to serve  but it could have been a lot smoother. I didn't give it a horrible rating because they tried hard and I understand their circumstances. I just think they shouldn't have started on the wrong foot when it came time to make a reservation. I probably wouldn't come back here again.
Kelly S.,Los Angeles  CA,64,89,147,2/6/2012,3.0,I give this place 3 stars not for the food  but for the service. A friend and I walked in and the woman taking take out orders just looked at us but didn't speak. We stood there for 2 minutes before I walked over to her and she told me that the woman working the front was off somewhere and would be back shortly. Just before we decided to walk out a manager-like gentleman came out and seated us. We ordered our meals and the food was delicious. I ordered the rib eye steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Delicious!!! My only gripe was I only received what I considered a small portion of potatoes. My friend ordered one of the burgers  but didn't eat the bun so I helped myself to that. Tasty! If you can stand not so good service  but good food give'em a try.
Thomas K.,Palos Verdes Peninsula  CA,191,12,4,3/19/2014,5.0,Had a really great server (James) that was super helpful. Didn't get the brew I wanted but he took care of me. Place was packed when we got here but a table for 3 opened up quickly for us. Prices are higher here but reasonable.
Becky S.,Los Angeles  CA,7,23,42,6/29/2012,3.0,Come either before lunch rush or after it b/c the service seriously goes down hill during. Other than that the food is consistent with all other bj's. Yummy & predictable. The lunch specials are an excellent deal. I usually get the 1/2 baked potato & salad combo. The mini pizzas are also a good deal & you don't feel as FAT when you finish one... (i guess i can only speak for myself on that one)...My main & really only gripe about this place is the service. I've gotten a few servers with some attitude - mainly the girls by the way- & recently had to wait a long long time for someone to take our drink order- which is usually a deal breaker but predictably consistent good food is sadly hard to come by these days  so I'll be going back to bj's. Oh yeah & I heard they do a great brunch so i'll be trying that out one of these days also.
Lisa P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,4/15/2015,1.0,Culver City location. Plastic tasting fries. Overly sweet bbq sauce that made it taste like its from a can (probably was). How do you ruin potato skins? Even those were like rubber. Cobbler? Microwaved. So gross  rubbery and disgustingly chewy. I was starving and still didn't want to eat it. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAVE NEVER TASTED MORE DISGUSTING FOOD. You could goto a freezer section in the supermarket and get a better meal for a fraction of the over priced food I just got. Never again. 1 star is kind.
Johnson N.,Los Angeles  CA,220,377,258,4/29/2011,4.0,I have to agree with Henry C. about the average ratings for BJ's. I've been to many BJ's  and I can usually expect to have good service  good food  and good beer. As expected  the same happened here. My friend and I decided to hit up BJ's to watch an NBA playoff game over a couple of beers. As usual  I ordered the Blonde.. a light and very refreshing brew  specific to BJ's Brewery.To eat  I ordered the Scampi Pasta-Angel Hair pasta with olive oil  butter  garlic  a little lemon juice  and a choice of blackened or regular shrimp. I went with the regular shrimp.Even though it is a pasta dish  it felt very light because it didn't have some kind of heavy sauce or heavy meats on it. It was slightly tangy  from the lemon juice and tomatoes  and buttery with a hint of garlic. I loved the combination of flavors with each bite.The atmosphere was definitely upbeat and fun to be in. 4 Stars.
Crystal K.,Los Angeles  CA,32,178,15,1/15/2011,1.0,Alright  I'm going to try to be friendly as possible. The drinks = great. The food = spectacular. But the service absolutely totally SUCKS. We ordered a dessert  the strawberry beignet (which  by the way  is not a beignet; it's just fried bread dipped in sugar) and it took the server well over 20 minutes to tell us they ran out of strawberry syrup for it. 20 minutes??? For some strawberry syrup??? GTFOH. Whatever happened to common courtesy? We ended up getting the dessert for free but it'll be a long time before we'll go back there. Diner Beware!
Beatrice T.,Los Angeles  CA,303,357,101,5/26/2011,4.0,Good service  prompt delivery  and I'm in love with their deep dish pizzas. I don't even care about the toppings  their crispy on the outside  fluffy on the inside crust is soooooo delish. (Cheeseburger and BJ's are muy bueno)Mango margarita was my favorite of the frozen margarita selection. White peach and strawberry were meh.... Comfortable sports bar setting with TV's all around so that I can see my Sharks lose. Sigh.
Daniel U.,Los Angeles  CA,231,13,6,7/6/2013,1.0,Worst service ever. It is extremely extremely slow. Got in at 7 pm and got out at 10 pm not because it was really busy but because our server came once every hour to check on us. Food quality was terrible compared to other BJs. TERRIBLE DO NOT GO. #angrycustomer
Namya S.,Chino  CA,3,18,6,8/13/2013,1.0,"This used to be one of my favorite places until I ordered to go the other today. My Parmesan crusted chicken was made quicker than the shrimp tacos and they had my chicken chillin in a little oven for 20 minutes. Asked for the manager...he was not accommodating nor understanding that I did not want a 20 minute old order. I explained to him that if we were dining in they would bring our fresh food to the table together. He insisted that if we dine in that it would be under a heat lamp getting ""dried out"" and if he makes me another then my shrimp tacos will be cold. What he should have said was ""I\'m sorry  I will remake both of them so they will be ready at the same time and/or I\'ll discount your meal etc etc"" He never once apologized and was not understanding at all. Will not be returning until it has new management. 1 star for the to go girl being understanding And patient."
Karissa M.,San Diego  CA,11,24,5,8/5/2013,1.0,I would never give a bad review unless it was HORRIBLE! And this place seriously needs to retrain their staff! I still couldn't tell you who our server was.. and it should never take 7 minutes to bring Parmesan cheese to a table  especially for a place that sells pizza!
Sokey L.,Santa Monica  CA,1193,325,155,12/16/2010,3.0,The bf and I were craving a pazookie one Friday night after dinner and decided to go to BJs. I've never been to this BJ's location before and was surprised that the crowd was very... ghetto fabulous? I never imaged that crowd being in Culver City  but it is next Inglewood. Go figure.We sat that the bar because we didn't want to wait. They have flat screen TVs everywhere along the perimeter. We got the pazookie... A+  like always. They have tons of beers on tab. Lots of different appetizer. Service was very fast and friendly. A-Ok place. 3 stars because their menu is mediocre at best. But everyone knows you go to BJs for the atmosphere and pazookie  not the food. I like their Great White Pizza though. Good crust!
Landis S.,Los Angeles  CA,99,67,6,7/26/2011,2.0,The first two times I've gone here were great. Granted it was closer to when this location opened but despite some steep prices  my wife and I had a great time out. Food was okay and the wait staff were friendly. The last two times I've managed to land straight out jerks as servers. It killed my mood and my buzz. I shouldn't have to expect attitude when I go ANYWHERE!! Hey  if you hate your job... QUIT!My wife was a waitress for several years and there's no excuse for unprofessional attitudes. It's your job to be friendly  A**HOLES. I will definitely think twice about going back.
Eric R.,Whittier  CA,94,406,19,12/13/2011,3.0,I have been to this location I believe 2 times with my insignificant other and have had good experiences both times.Their beer selection is awesome right now (winter time) they have some pretty good specialty beers to choose from  don't be afraid to try some new ones.Food is always up to par and I recommend their Ahi Tuna appetizer.Good place to go every once in awhile to get some decent pizza and a decent environment.
Andrew P.,Los Angeles  CA,28,15,,1/3/2011,1.0,Never coming back...came in with my girlfriend and walked out 3 seconds later.Service is bad. The people seem to lie about not having tables available..like wtf  I see three empty tables?!?!
Shale G.,Mojave  CA,38,3,3,2/16/2014,5.0,Just got served by a waiter named Nick. It was wonderful. He was pleasant and made eye contact. Made sure our table and all the tables around us were satisfied the entire time. This is the first BJs I've been to where I enjoyed my entire experience. Thank you nick!!
Nicole C.,Berkeley  CA,0,4,,8/19/2013,1.0,"SAD PANDA.I don\'t EVER have to write a bad review so this was a momentous occasion.We love BJ\'s in Arizona  but this location was absolutely horrible.We were seated much later than we were told we were going to be- no biggie  we didn\'t care. Our waiter  Alejandro  Ignored us most of the time while talking to his friends at the table across the way. Thanks to this- our drinks took 20 minutes  our appetizers were never ordered  and when our food arrived a half an hour later (without any of our appetizers ever coming) they were mediocre and one dish even splattered all over the plate and missing items. After nicely asking for some couscous they returned 10 minutes later with a dish of cold salmon and more splattered sauce everywhere. The manager  a lady came over three times offereing us a pizzokie and claiming the waiter never told her he forgot our appetizers  or that our food arrived cold and messy.Also  this whole time instead of Alejandro being more attanetive he ignored us. We asked for the check and instead he ignored us for 20 minutes more. When the manager stopped by again she ""apparently"" had no idea what was going on. We said we didn\'t ask for her and that we wanted to leave and pay.I eneded up never even eating becauase my dish was messed up so many times. After turning down their offer for free dessert (who wants that when we can\'t even get a meal right!?) they were offended we didn;t want dessert and got in our face asking us why didn\'t want to try ordering more food.The manager even said ""isnt that what you come to a restaurant for""?! really lady? yea I do  that\'s why I needed to get the hell out of there and eat some real food at a place with decent service. I won;t even repeat everything this dumb manager said or this ridiculous waiter did. Guys not all BJ\'s are alike. Yup  I said it. These people need to seriously have their heads examined and understand how a restaurant should be run."
Kay K.,Pismo Beach  CA,15,214,,10/9/2013,2.0,"There were 3 of us  expecting 2 more  so we told the hostess we were a party of 5. 15 minute wait  no problem. 15 minutes later  they call for us ""party of 4"". We told them we had stated party of 5  had to wait another 10-15 minutes. (We had been traveling for hours through rush hour traffic and were very hungry) Yes it\'s Monday Night Football  yes the Dodgers are in the playoffs (YAY!!)  but only the bar was busy (in my opinion). Our server was nice about splitting our checks (we\'re in town on business being reimbursed by our employer  makes things easier)  we ordered drinks  appetizers  and our entrees by the time our other 2 showed up. So far  everything\'s maybe 3-3.25 stars  UNTIL we get our food... My mashed potatoes were cold and my garlic bread was inedible  (I didn\'t send it back because bj\'s has food runners  which is WHY I HATE DINING AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!! I want the person who took my order bring me my food as well!!! My server was nowhere to be found.) they forgot my one friend\'s side salad and his shrimp pasta was a mess of sauce and noodles (and hardly any shrimp) and another\'s chicken salad was a plate full of lettuce and about 5 little bites of chicken. Most of the staff were standing around either watching football or the Dodger game. The last BJ\'s Brewhouse I ate was was the one in Modesto when it had first opened (about 3 years ago) and it was fun. The only good thing about the night was that the Dodgers won and I got to spend some time out of work with people I work with that I actually like!"
N H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,,4/15/2015,3.0,Only 3 stars given because I frequently visit BJ's however when ordering take out check your meals. I ordered several to go orders and 1 was missing and 1 meal was prepared incorrectly. I was reimbursed but I had to make the drive back to the restaurant. More recently  I sat inside and ordered from the gluten free menu with minor substitutions. After a lengthy wait  I was told my meal got accidentally cancelled. Then when I did receive my meal  it was incorrect. Again I was compensated and given a soup while a waited but the frustration remained.
Helen S.,Rancho Palos Verdes  CA,237,485,,11/17/2011,4.0,BJ's is always an easy place to go if you can't decide what you feel like. My problem when I go is I order too much because I can't make up my mind. My must orders are: stuffed mushrooms  any of the flat bread pizzas  ahi poke  buffalo wings  and the spinach & artichoke dip. and...you MUST save room for the pizookies. I always like to get a mix of 2 different flavors. Most recently  I got the white chocolate macadamia + red velvet... I highly recommend it!parking can be irritating because it is connected to the mall  but there was no line wait when we came on a Sunday afternoon! yay!
AJ T.,Leonia  NJ,1,46,9,1/13/2014,1.0,Food is horrible! This place makes Shakeys taste like gourmet. Timing is off--drinks served when appetizer finished and meals came out unevely.
Dominique M.,Beverly Hills  CA,1938,369,2460,10/25/2010,3.0,I love the Ahi poke here! Fresh and delicious. I've dined here once and ordered Ahi poke to go twice... The first time I was here the world cup was on  and it was so packed and loud. Nice vibe for true soccer fans :) I did admire the beer selection too! Everything else I've had here was just blah nothing special at all. The service not bad but not great either. Worth giving a try yelpers!
KengiKat C.,Hollywood  CA,26,139,13,1/2/2011,1.0,Ok I love BJ's in Westwood  but the one at the Fox Hills Mall or whatever they are calling that place these days  is just the pits.I had to go to that mall because I had two JCPenny gift cards that I needed to use and while there we got hungry and decided to eat at BJ's. Well we should have went with our first mind and drive to Santa Monica so we could eat at ZENGO  but we were pressed for time.First off the service was crappy. Three times the server came back to ask out drink order and once it came it was still wrong. I will say the pulled pork sandwich was good  but everything else was just crap.The silverware was dirty and had the nerve to be all wrapped up in linen. When we showed the server he acted as if it was ok and had no clue as to how to fix it. We had to tell he we wanted CLEAN silverware.Not at all what I am use to from the Westwood location  but I know I will not be going back to this place ever. I dont care if it is the only place open in LA. I got better food service from the Union Rescue Mission and if you read my blog  then you know how bad that experience was.
Aryonia W.,Lawndale  CA,0,3,3,7/13/2014,1.0,You know the service was horrible if I created a yelp account just to make a review. Where do I even start? I've been here before with one friend and the service was quite okay but this time it was the worst service I have ever had! My sister and a friend came with me and we came in on a Sunday night hungry and ready to have a good time. However that's the total opposite of what we got. I live in torrance and go to BJs over there and never have a problem. Yet this was just sad so we got seated instantly and was sitting at the table for about 20 minutes until we were asked for a drink then we ordered at the same time because it took so long! When the food came 20 minutes later! My sister asked for no tomatoes  no pickles and what do you know? they came with it! My friend ordered a well done burger and it was medium rare!so she sent it back and we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and get pizookies but they were burnt and and half done too! Even funnier thing is these came before my friends burger did! So we asked for a manager and the waiter got smart so we asked OUR waiter and the General manager came 10 minutes later! So he listened to my sister complain and she said she wouldn't pay for anything because we barely ate and the service was sad. He left to figure out a solution and he decided to cover the bill. Meanwhile when my sister complained he mentioned that he apologized for the experience and that the night was busy and they wouldn't have so many customers if everyone's experience was as bad as ours but based off these reviews doesn't look any different from ours! Point is my friend never ate! My stomach felt some kind of way after and my sister never had to complain like that and I've never had a bad experience but I guess that's life. Will not be coming back here sticking to Torrance. :( Tip: get it together.
maura m.,Wilmington  CA,4,20,1,1/5/2015,5.0,So we walked in here after being ignored at Lucille's next door. Our server was super sweet and super attentive. The food came really fast and did I mention our waiter was awesome ? I can't remember his name but we love great customer service ! We will be returning :)
Robert B.,Saint Paul  MN,74,28,9,12/13/2013,2.0,I would give it more stars for food and atmosphere but the wait staff and hostesses are TERRIBLE. They are rude and straight from the ghetto.
Cesar Q.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,9/16/2012,4.0,Personally I don't know why this place has 2 and a half stars this place is great! The food is great the put sports to watch games and its a fun place to eat with friends and family. The service when I go there is good. Only had one time i had bad service is when I asked this lady for some ranch and the lady gave me a stair and rolled her eyes and never came back with my ranch. But other than that if your gonna come here during football or basketball season  expect a great atmosphere while you enjoy your time with family and friends with great food! Even though I'm on a diet i will be coming here!
Stan C.,Marina del Rey  CA,0,16,,4/25/2014,1.0,"Terrible food and service. ""Bison"" burger was flatter than mcdonalds cheeseburger  and the ""slaw"" that came with it was made up of lettuce mix with some added salad dressing."
Yahance D.,Long Beach  CA,132,32,35,11/10/2013,4.0,Our server Alex with wonderful she was great!! She did everything she could to for almost 25 minutes to get the Laker game on. He finally changed it a minute before halftime smh. Food was good tho
Lupe G.,Inglewood  CA,0,8,2,2/20/2015,1.0,Thanks for a really really bad service Michael S. Don't even bother guys. I came in at 11:20 pm with my boyfriend. We ordered only two beers  one appetizer and one entry and didn't receive it until 12:25 am. I would understand if it was their rush our  but come on! They were already closing!! The place was empty. The server comes back saying. Oh I'm sorry I forgot about you guys  and brings our food all cold that was just sitting there. Even the guacamole that we got was already brown from the top. Not only that but he tells us that we can't order another beer or food because they closed the kitchen and the bar  like come on!! Really??!!!! We had to pay almost $50.00 for something we didn't like. Your horrible attitude did not help at all Michael. Thanks to you we will choose another restaurant that will treat us better. I hope you enjoyed your $1.00 tip!!!
Amara S.,Los Angeles  CA,315,266,432,9/25/2011,3.0,To start off  I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants  let alone some place like BJ's. Our server was nice and somewhat attentive. The noise level was sort of a turn off. Places that are loud and play TVs everywhere aren't my cup of tea. We were sat within 2 mins and the hostesses were really nice.The appetizer flat bread pizza was pretty tasty but definitely overpriced. 10 bucks for four small pieces each? EH.
Kristine D.,Los Angeles  CA,220,70,2,12/12/2012,5.0,I like BJ's because they have a wide selection of dishes. This spot gets pretty packed during big games or right after church. It's not too bad though. The longest I've waited to be seated was around 20 minutes. That night  they were super busy. Our server was hustling and sweating trying to get everyone's orders. He and the rest of the staff seemed to be helping each other so that the customers weren't neglected. It was pretty rad. Even though the place was full  we didn't have to wait long for our order. We left a generous tip. They deserved it.
Lilly G.,Ontario  CA,16,24,10,11/29/2013,5.0,Grey service and friendly staff. Finding parkingnwas perhaps the hardest part of our experience however the timely service and delicious food was well worth it.
Hion L.,Fullerton  CA,469,665,412,11/12/2010,2.0,I came to this BJs and I think that they were still working out some kinks in their service. I had put in a pretty large to go order on their website for our office holiday party a week prior. But something was gnawing inside me to call and confirm. So when I call the night before  they cannot find any trace of my order even though I have a confirmation number. Then the ridiculousness of it all sets in. Apparently when you put in a order on their website it is through their corporate office  even though it is location specific. The corp office then faxes the order directly to the restaurant. So I asked the girl at BJs what happened. She told me their fax machine was turned off. But luckily she says they can still fill my order. No apologies  instead I was told that I should have called to put in the order instead. So it is my fault  huh? When did I get married to BJs? Only my wife gets to tell me that I am wrong all the time  godammit! I would have been killed by my coworkers if this had not gone through!Then I follow up with corporate and ask why there was no phone call to follow up. They stated that there was no need to. But my order got screwed up b/c the fax was off. The answer - Well  they shouldn't have turned it off. So shouldn't you guys check to call especially since you have already charged my card? Answer - the fax machine shouldn't be turned off. They did. They shouldn't. They did. They shouldn't. Wow  I didn't know they employed 4 year olds at corporate.
Pamela S.,Los Angeles  CA,40,40,18,11/13/2010,2.0,You'd expect more from a large chain restaurant. I ordered the salmon teriyaki from the lunch special menu. I think I was given but 5 or 6 small tiny pieces of salmon and my rice was drenched in teriyaki sauce. Not worth the price I paid but then again.. who would order salmon teriyaki at a pizza joint?! haha.. my fault!Our waitress Terri was a bit.. hmm.. slow.. probably because she doesn't LISTEN and just brushed us off as if she knew what we wanted. It seemed I had to repeat myself twice because I can see she didnt process the information the first time. Only after hearing it twice would she give some indication of comprehension.. Weird..Parking is horrible here even though it's free mall parking but it always seems full and you have to drive around several times. I was also surprised that was a wait for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon but the wait was just 10 or so minutes. For the OK service and food.. not a recommended place to grab a quick  satisfying lunch. It was my first time at this particular BJs and don't really see myself coming back for a long time.
Tony X.,Los Angeles  CA,7,26,,3/14/2013,1.0,A below average chain restaurant all the way around. Beer taps had fruit flies buzzing around them  the bar smelled like vinegar and the food is unimpressive. BKs in general isn't the best  but its consistent  usually know what you are getting. But this one  not a good place  poorly ran. Went once  never again.
Mot Y.,San Francisco  CA,275,676,101,10/15/2010,2.0,The beer here is crap. The food is just your normal bar type food  but they have plates as well. You know pasta  chicken a la whatever  but it's still crap. I have eaten here with colleagues way too many times. I think the last 3 meals I had here were mediocre at best. I have tried all of their beers as well and I can make these brews in my tub at home. Boring!
Aaron F.,Hermosa Beach  CA,206,424,,11/13/2010,1.0,Yes  the food is great. However  this location is the worst experience I have ever had. It also looks as if I am not the only one that has had this problem.My girlfriend and I were seated promptly and waited for 15 minutes before anyone came to us. We kept seeing a waiter looking over at us but never coming over from a distance. It looked as if he was chatting with another waiter for whatever reason. I had to flag the server to order our damn drink and wonder where our waiter was. Someone finally came over to take our order. We waited literally 25 minutes before we left two bucks for the drink and walked out. Horrible  horrible service. Never going back.
Cassandra R.,Los Angeles  CA,9,1,,6/8/2014,1.0,Okay!! This is the last time I will ever patronize this restaurant. Today I decided to take my daghter and my friend to this place but almost everytime we go they crowd customers and close half the restaurant and they give us a hard time because we always want a round booth. Today we waited 20 mins for the booth we wanted and it was open but the waitress walked right by. I asked if we could sit there and she said no its closed but it was in the middle with two booths on each side filled with people. When I questioned her she then told me we didn't have 4 people to qualify for that booth. I told her that I didn't want to sit where she sat us I wanted the booth and instead of pleasing the customer she was rude and said we couldn't have it and walked away and so did we!!! I've only been here a few times because of the rude service. We just went to Lucilles next door. They had great service and food 5 star for them. BJ's did not care one bit when we left and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my hard working money there. I guess it's true you get what you pay for.
Jeffrey T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,35,,1/9/2015,1.0,Friday evening  January 9  2015 attempted to place a telephone order. Called several times (8 to be exact) and the telephone rang with no answer. Called for the 9th time and the line was busy. What place of business does not answer its telephone? Needless to say I dined elsewhere.
Brittany S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,3/10/2015,2.0,Came here in Sept. 2014 and the experience was ok. The waiter was really tired and didn't want to serve us. But once he was given his $20 tip in advance his attitude changed. He became very friendly with us. It's really sad that a early tip gave us better service.
Bj U.,Waianae  HI,243,103,11,8/21/2011,2.0,"Yaaay everyone loves BJ\'s right ?!?! WRONG! we had gone there because a military buddy of mine is getting out of the army so this was like out good bye dinner drinking laughing night  the drinks came out great no problems we sat at the bar for some time having a good laugh and what not so the rest of our ppl come and we decide to get a table.No one helps us at all  about 20 mins of sitting and staring at each other we decide to flag anyone who works here and is walking right past us... we order our food... it takes Days to get to us.. jesus?! what is going on... our food gets to us and why is there water in my friend plate under his veggies? like literally a big puddle of water? he tilted his plate and there was a mini waterfall enough to fill half a cup? whats going on? not to mention the food he ordered ( dont know what it was) as he explained to me ""Tasts like crap"".... hows that possible?what ever... come here... go sit at the bar."
Victoria L.,Los Angeles  CA,8,53,13,12/8/2013,4.0,The menu was a bit limited for non-meat items  but other than that--the food was decent! The staff was super nice. I probably would go back again. I think I like Yardhouse better  but this place wasn't bad.
Fitz H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,3/4/2014,3.0,The wait was 25 min. No. The wait was 1 hour. Party of six in a less than spacious booth. No thank you. Four utensil/napkins...had to wait for the food to get the other two  after asking a waiter for the extra two. We ordered our drinks and he memorized all of them and brought them to us quickly with no fault. We ordered the food and he memorized that as well  spot on!
Ryan B.,Los Angeles  CA,39,111,123,8/22/2013,4.0,Very good menu and actually not all that pricy. I got fish n chips and they were delicious. The server was constantly asking me if I would like something to drink but I didn't feel like paying for a drink. It's very spacey and a great place to go either if you're only with one person or if you're in a group. I will certainly be back next time to try something new. Oh and try have wide screens that show sports which is great because I love my Dodgers  Saints and Packers. I definitely recommend BJ's for a date if your date likes it loud and sociable. My only issue is that there are so many people that your food takes forever to arrive. Other than that  pretty good spot!
Tom G.,Venice  CA,7,219,20,1/12/2011,2.0,"A generic  uninspired version of the Cheesecake Factory.Had a few hours to kill before a movie  so my friends and I stopped in here on the rationale that we could watch football while we ate.Service was slow  table and menus were sticky  and the food was utterly mediocre. They got at least one thing wrong per order.And then there was beer. Despite the ""brewhouse"" claim  I decided to play it safe by ordering a Boddingtons. Wishful thinking. The beer was totally flat  and tasted like it had come from a 2 day old keg.Prices aren\'t high  but it still felt like we overpaid. Avoid."
Traci K.,Inglewood  CA,32,234,100,3/16/2013,4.0,Delicious! I have only been 1 other time  but couldn't remember the experience to save my life! So my husband and I went last night and it was right up our alley! It was poppin for a Friday night too! We like a live crowd that we fit in! Anywho  our waitress was amazing  the food was amazing as well! I had the cajun pasta and my hubby had the jambalaya! YUM! The drinks aren't all that. My strawberry margarita was lacking the strawberry flavor big time  but their signature all star drink the Strawberry Splash was amazing! YUMMY! But my hubby wasn't happy about his ICED FILLED GLASS that was suppose to be long island iced tea! Watered down he said... Sighs..Guess with the live upbeat crowd  they didn't want anyone getting tooooo wasted! LOL
Mike H.,Inglewood  CA,30,43,35,11/21/2013,4.0,Beer  food  big T.V.s and pizza. Everything you need for a great time. Staff is always nice and rite on the ball. Only wish they had a better Happy Hour  or at least it lasted more than hour. Prices are a bit on the high side for what it is Food Wise  but the beer is great and makes up for a lot!!! See you at Happy Hour.
Alexander C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,,1/14/2014,2.0,Mediocre KingFood is not great but not badPizookie redeems
Stess K.,Los Angeles  CA,4,10,,3/7/2013,3.0,I am pained to write this  but in the almost 2 years I have been eating here  I have yet to have timely service... Why keep going  you ask? The few entrees that I order on rotation are reallllly good and the location is super close to where I live. In February I took my boss who was visiting on the east coast and the wait time for every step of the way was almost comical. I was actually able to leave  drive my boyfriend to work in the far side of culver  return  find parking  and come back before anything major had happened at the table. Again  I find the food to be good  but you need to allot a good amount of time  unfortunately.
Mel M.,Culver City  CA,1,22,3,11/16/2014,1.0,"I ordered online for curbside delivery. My order was supposed to be ready at 5:30. I arrive at 5:20 and drove around looking for the posted curbside sign as directed. There is not a sign. I called and asked the restaurant and the first person I talked to said there wasn\'t one and to park either in a takeout spot or in a close parking space  then she put me on hold. It was super busy because it was a Sunday night but I eventually found a close parking space five minutes later. I was still on hold. Finally someone came back to the phone (a different person) and asked where I was parked. I said I was in a 2 hour parking spot right outside the restaurant. Her response was  ""all the way down there?"" I told her I was literally right outside the restaurant and this is where the first woman told me to go. She told me to move to the mall valet and put my blinkers on  and that my food wasn\'t ready yet. So now it\'s ten minutes after my food was supposed to be done. I moved and sat there for another five minutes and she came out. When I got home I noticed that my ice cream was in a non insulated container and right on top of my hot food. It also was vanilla when I asked for chocolate (I double checked my receipt). The cookie was burnt and in a ripped foil covering. They didn\'t open the vents on the container that my entree was in so the fries were soggy. On top of that  they tasted weird like they were freezer burned. The chicken strips were mostly breading and no actual chicken. Needles to say  I won\'t be back."
Alma G.,Los Angeles  CA,2,19,,5/23/2011,5.0,I don't know why the bad reviews.My co-worker and I  had lunch here and loved it. The food was yummy and the service spectacular. The waitress was very nice  she made us feel sooo welcomed.I will be returning soon :)
Henry C.,Torrance  CA,3331,403,8,6/23/2010,4.0,Wow! I'm shocked at the ratings this restaurant has received... an average of 2 and a half stars? That's pretty harsh... I guess I'm gonna try to bring this up to 3.....I've always enjoyed BJ's restaurant & brewhouse. I only have had it one other time but if my memory serves me I remember it was delicious tasting deep dish pizzas that they offer. Although they offer many other things on their menu  pizza has always been the one thing that I go there for...(Oh and the Blondes that they have! Delicious! I'm talking about alcohol fellas!)Had a business meeting here yesterday at about 1:30ish.. surprisingly it was still really packed and had to wait for a table to be available. (The restaurant is not that big compared to other BJs)Once the party was there we were seating immediately. Overall  the initial service was great as the hostess was really friendly and nice.Once we sat down at our requested seats (Which she got us a nicer quieter corner as requested) we were greeted by the server. We then proceed and ordered a large half and half pizza that was half BBQ chicken and half Mediterranean. The Mediterranean side was slightly more salty due to the pepperchinis and the olives but the flavor was pretty good. The BBQ chicken side well........ it's BBQ chicken! So it's pretty hard to go wrong there. The deep dished crust was slightly crispy and buttery which is what I really enjoy in a pizza (As you can see I'm not really a thin crust fan) So overall once again I've had a terrific pizza experience here at BJs.The only gripe that I can see having at this location are the following..1) Parking.... for some strange reason  parking is always difficult here. Ever since Westfield took over the mall (Formally known as Fox Hills Mall)  they have renovated the place and it's looking so much nicer! Perhaps that's the reason why parking were tough to come by. There is a garage parking but it's wrapped around the other side so I usually don't use that enterance.2) Wait time...The restaurant is smaller than the others so more waiting time is required here... so just have to make a reservation or plan ahead...3) Waiter... Although he was accommodating to the party and cordial  he didn't really smiled at all giving the impression that he wasn't really enjoying what he was doing... I think a smile would have been much better and that's my opinion. Like the hostess who was smiling all the time it provided a very radiant and warm feeling  but the waiter just killed it... (But he was nice and we left him a pretty good tip regardless)Hopefully this can bring the stars up a little bit... too good of a restaurant to be rated so low.
Silvia F.,Long Beach  CA,164,86,569,9/2/2012,4.0,I been to Bj's many many times and I've always gotten great customer service. The hostess can sometimes seem bored and rude depending on who is there  but the service I've gotten from the waiters is what has me coming back! One of the coolest waitress' I've had so far is Francis. This woman really enjoys her job. She was so attentive and super informative  but best of all she suggested foods  drinks(alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and desserts. For example  my mom was undecided on her iced tea  and Francis brought her three different flavors without us knowing  Pomergrant Iced Tea  Regular Iced Tea and I can't remember the other  but I expected to get all three charged and I didn't get charged since it was a sample  plus she was being helpful :) you can really see the passion in the woman! She's a very happy person :) the food is pretty delicious  but what I really come for are those delicious pizookies to end you brunch or dinner! I can say I will continue coming here in hopes of getting Francis as my waitress again  but I doubt I'll have that kinda luck lol. So if anyone gets Francis as their waitress  believe me you'll be more then satisfied with her service. P.S: this place can get packed!!! But the reason for the four star review is because many times they have available seats but they still make customers wait 15mins or more  which sucks when one is super mega starving!
Tai F.,Los Angeles  CA,406,822,169,11/1/2010,3.0,I like BJs. I like their pizza and I like their pizzookies (I realize I probably spelled that wrong but care very little about it.) But I don't looooove it and I it's very unlikely that I would ever go out of my way to eat at a BJs. The office staff went last week to celebrate one of my coworker's birthdays. I called ahead to let them know that there would be 9 of us coming and they said they would have a table ready. Supposedly they don't take reservations but this sort of felt exactly like that. And  when we got there  there was a table ready for us.The waitress was efficient and kept all of our glasses full the entire meal. There was a tiny mistake on one of my coworkers salads but other than that everyone seemed to like their meals.I had a mini pizza and a house salad. I might be a little spoiled but the house salad here was just plain bad. It seemed that the greens had been allowed to age in the plastic bag I'm sure they came in and then sort of just dumped haphazardly onto my plate with a few stiff julienned carrots. It was pretty pitiful and I ultimately left most of it behind. The pizza was good they got the toppings right but there was only cheese on half of it which seemed a bit odd. I still enjoyed every bite.Like I said  BJs is fine but it doesn't make me drool and really  that's the reaction food should always incite.
Craig H.,Los Angeles  CA,4,27,3,8/15/2011,3.0,Good happy hour prices--Decent Beer- Mini Pizzas 1/2 off..But the wait for the normal restaurant is Crazy- --If you sit at the bar watching a game at happy hour-its worth it.A long wait for a table at this place is crazy--- Food is good when on happy hour special - beside that probably overpriced. 2 star
Jackie G.,Hawthorne  CA,16,6,,1/13/2013,3.0,"So my boyfriend and I decided to go to BJ\'s in Torrance  but the wait time was 1hr-1hr and 30 minutes. So  my boyfriend decided to go to the one in Culver City  which we can phone ahead and make reservations. When we got there the host gave me one of those vibrating devices and told me it would be 25-30 minutes. Okay we decided to go to the mall to buy something. We went back downstairs and noticed that these two girls who just got there were seated right away. I went up to ask the host if they had called us and said yes we called you a long time ago. Hmmm weird? It didn\'t vibrate. She said ""Oh it doesn\'t vibrate."" Okay? why would you give it to me to begin with??? It would of been nice if someone would of informed us we had to stay locked inside with the huge crowd of people! Whatever  we got seated right away and took nearly 20 minutes for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered wings  which were awesome! That night I went safe and ordered fettucini alfredo  and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken pizza  easy celery and onion. We got our food and my pasta tasted like plain pasta yuck! Then my boyfriends pizza had so much tomato sauce and the sauce was super sweet while the buffalo sauce was really spicy. It felt like we were eating bread with a spicy and sweet sauce  not so delicious! When the waitress asked us how were doing we asked for ranch  thinking it would minimize that sweet flavor. It took nearly 20 minutes to bring it out hmmm i hope they were making it from scratch! Finally we ordered a mini pazzoki best part of the night! When we got our pazzoki the waitress didn\'t leave the bill  we already knew it would be another waiting game with her! Finally after 10 minutes she brought us our bill  and then waited another 20 to come back with our receipt  since we paid with a card. Overall the Torrance location is way better! They always get the order right they\'re fast their pasta doesn\'t taste plain and best part their little vibrating thing works anywhere in the mall."
Kelly K.,Pasadena  CA,262,430,128,11/6/2010,1.0,WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN A RESTAURANT.This place made me so angry it's not even worth a review. But I feel others should have fair warning.We were seated on a Sunday night at non-peak hours so it wasn't busy. A waiter never greeted us. A female manager saw us looking around for help so she approached us after 10 minutes. She took our drink orders and offered a free appetizer  but since we had a movie to catch that night  we placed our dinner order then and there as well. A male waiter came up and apologized (upon orders by the manager). Never saw him again. Our drinks and appetizer were delivered by the manager. The table next to us sat down after us  got a waiter  and got their drinks  entrees and dessert before we got our entree. Since our waiter didn't come back and the female manager was incognito  I approached a male manager at the front. He apologized and went into the kitchen and brought us our food within 3 minutes or so. I asked him if it has been sitting under a heat lamp and he said no. Then a female waitress approached us and asked how our meal was and said she was taking over for the other guy. The food did in fact taste not-so-fresh and we had waited 50-60 minutes from the time we sat down to eat so we weren't even really hungry anymore. We tried to flag down the waitress to give us our check but had to get the manager again and yes everything did get comped  not just the app  but the complete lack of attention from the ENTIRE wait staff in addition to management was abysmal. He offered a free dessert  but why would we want to wait an additional 30 minutes for melted ice cream to be brought to us?AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Ellie V.,Los Angeles  CA,16,5,2,1/18/2014,1.0,Been to this place twice. Both times got awful service. First time there  we got a table right away  but everything else took forever. This time we sat at the bar. Ordered a drink and paid for it. The bartender never bothered asking if we wanted anything else  or another drink even after our cups were empty.
Lauren M.,Los Angeles  CA,131,115,22,5/3/2010,4.0,My cousin and I came here the first weekend it opened. That was a stupid thing to do. It was an hour and a half wait so we left. Since the night of its grand opening I have been back several times with a variety of different people. Each visit left me one satisfied customer; it's just as good as the Torrance location. :)My first official visit to this BJ's was with my mom. We went during an off day because we figured that since the place was still so new we'd go when it was not the weekend. When we walked in we were greeted by the friendly hostess and were seated right away. I ordered the mini pepperoni  olive  and mushroom deep dish pizza along with a side of Caesar salad. My mom got one of their sandwich meals with steak fries. We both loved what we got and even though the crust of my pizza is reminiscent of Pizza Hut's it's 100x better. I think it's the cheese that makes the difference; it's just so creamy and delicious! My next visit I went with my cousin and my roll dawg Rosie (same cousin from the first paragraph visit). This time it was a Saturday night and the wait time was a good 20-25 minutes. No big deal. Rosie and I chatted our heads off until our table was called so it was all good. So  we sat down and we both ordered a side Caesar salad to start off with. Rosie substituted the Caesar for her customary ranch and I asked the waiter to give me a side of balsamic vinaigrette. My salad came back already dressed with the vinaigrette instead of being on the side but it's cool; I don't really stress over little things like that. As an entree I ordered the Cajun Pasta as recommended by Rosie (she ordered the same thing) and boy is it good! I really think this dish offers some real stiff competition to my favorite CPK pasta entree  which is the Spicy Jambalaya. Next visit: I'm back with my mom and sister. We came here about a few weeks ago and what makes this day stand out in my mind is the phenomenal server we had. I think his name is Brad. Caucasian dude of average height  spiky dark hair  with a Boston/New York accent. He is most definitely a Triple Threat in the land of restaurant serving: Efficient  Personable  and Attentive. He's one of the best servers I've ever had in all my years of restaurant dining. Latest visit: Yesterday I went to BJ's with my good friend to hit up the Lakers vs Jazz game. We sat at the bar facing the mega inch TV and proceeded to order our alcohol. I got the Riesling and she got the What a Peach. Both drinks were good. I ended up ordering three glasses and she ended the meal with two. Now  back to the food. First  we got the pot stickers. They were ok  kind of bland but edible. Next  we shared a small pizza. On her side was pepperoni and on my side was pepperoni  olives  and mushroom. The deep dish was yummy as always. Finally  we ordered the chocolate chip/peanut butter Pazookie (my first time having this thing). I totally get the hype over this dessert. Melted vanilla ice cream and a warm  sweet  and chewy  cookie. Perfect!As far as the atmosphere is concerned it is always nice and chill here. Yesterday was especially fun since everybody was in fine spirits over the game. Also  the servers and bartenders at the bar were on point so service was quite efficient. The only bad thing about yesterday is that the Lakers won the game. Oh well! lol
Ms J.,Lomita  CA,0,81,8,7/21/2014,3.0,Enjoyed this location. Have visited 2x after lunch rush and both times had a good experience. Along with good food.
steve L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,20,,10/9/2014,5.0,BJ is the bomb I got good food and great service. Sat at the bar got served right away.arnesto the bartender was attentive and did a good job. My bacon cheeseburger was delectable! Will definitely go back love all the beers on tap!!
Andrea D.,Los Angeles  CA,568,21,20,5/24/2013,1.0,I love BJ's in general but I hate this location of BJ. HORRIBLE HOSTESS AND WAITRESSES. I went in last night to go eat dinner with my boyfriend. Once we went in I already have a bad vibe about the place  we had to wait about 5 mins till the hostess said something to us because they were to busy gossiping. Finally  the hostess welcomed us and then told us about the happy hours special they were having and then immediately told us to go up the ramp and seat ourself down. I found it really odd to do that because we didnt ask for there specials and i thought they were suppose to seat us. We followed her direction anyways and went up the ramp and tried looking for a seat but there was none open  so we went back to the hostess desk and told her there was no seats and we would like a table since theres plenty of empty booths/tables open at the time. She said okay and then walked away. We waited for about 10 mins and she was no where to be found. So we just left. There was many waitress there just standing and talking to one another. I was pretty disappointed. They need better service and more professional staffs.
Diana H.,El Segundo  CA,44,328,4,4/13/2011,3.0,MEH. The food was too salty and just not that good. And I'm not a grandma who complains that food is too salty. I had the clam chowder which was OK. And the Shrimp Scampi which was just gross. The shrimp was mushy - obviously not fresh and it just was not good.The service was good though - everyone was really friendly.And I should have just ordered a pizookie to end my lunch right.Will I come again? NAH.
Corky G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,110,49,6/15/2013,3.0,Manager not here today. Can tell because the tables around us take literally 30 minutes to be cleared. A lot of empty tables and a 20 minute wait at the door. The only thing consistent is the great service and their teamwork!
Tina-Marie L.,La Mirada  CA,584,586,357,5/26/2010,2.0,"Dude! I can\'t believe this BJ\'s continues to get so much business. I\'ve been here twice  once as a sit-down  another as a phone order to pick-up. Both times  I\'ve left feeling dissatisfied. The first time our waitress left us for lengthy periods of time to fend for ourselves. Normally  you can flag down another waiter/waitress and they\'ll help you. Oh  not at this BJ\'s. We needed flatware and instead of just getting the napkin roll  we were told  ""I\'ll let your server know."" Refer back to leaving us for lengthy periods of time  and I\'ll just say that the food was mildly warm by the time I had my utensils.Second time  on my way to class  my carpool buddy and I decided to order via phone and swing by to pick it up. Easy order; 1 Angel Hair Toscana with Chicken  1 Wedge Salad. We get there and her wedge salad is almost non-existent. The existing parts has brown edges. When we asked if we could pay separately  the cashier said that that would be fine. Little did we know we were asking her to divide the Red Sea and she would need Moses to help her divide our check. She input something wrong on the computer  had to call the manager  the manager after laughing at the front with co-workers  moseys her way on down and then says she lost her G-14 Classified Manager Card that will allow her to change the transaction. She apologizes and says she will need to go find her card and then she will return. In the meantime  our cashier starts punching some things in and miraculously gets it to work. While we were waiting my friend asks why the salad is so small and she mentions that it was an add-on to my entree. WTF?! We didn\'t ask for an accompanying dinner salad; we wanted a complete salad.Anyhow  15 minutes later  we were finally out of there. Not... going... back..."
Michi S.,Los Angeles  CA,183,168,120,3/9/2011,2.0,I went to BJ with a large party on a weekend. so we did have a long wait  (which was expected). Once seated it took maybe another 30mins just for waiter to take our order. Food was great  but it took along time for watier to check on us  etc... service was poor. maybe they need to hire more workers
Annie A.,Santa Monica  CA,42,20,3,1/15/2012,4.0,After reading the recent reviews on Yelp about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse I was pretty nervous that our party 12 decided to go there today for lunch. Despite the recent reviews of this restaurant  our experience was positive. Our waiter  Luis  was really attentive and gave our group really good service.  He kept our drinks full  food came out quickly and orders were correct. The only reason they did not get a 5 star rating is because I kept having to stack & hand staff the empty plates from the appetizers and salads that were crowding the table.
Jerome L.,Los Angeles  CA,336,249,114,3/13/2011,4.0,Come here for the happy hour and leave happy.Mini pizza was delicious as always per BJ's standards.Cheeseburger sliders with bacon were delicious but I think BJ's needs to buy a clue from Yardhouse and put some pastrami in these babies. Yum!Kamikaze shooters were standard and so was the price.Sangria tasted very bitter. Then again  I don't think I've ever had a good sangria anywhere.BJ's Irish Root Beer is absolutely delicious. Just order the next chance you get. I know what my favorite drink at BJ's is now! Oreo cookie pizooki with vanilla ice cream on top was excellent.I'm removing one-star because the restroom wasn't as clean as it should have been and I almost slipped and fell on a puddle of water in there. At least I hope it was water.Four stars for the delicious food and the awesome service by our waitress  Anita!
Princess P.,Los Angeles  CA,39,272,176,4/5/2013,3.0,Wow  I am shocked by all the bad reviews. I've come here a few times with my gal pals and we've always had excellent service. Oooh Lawd those pizookis...I can't!! They are super rich  gooey  and heavily ladened with calories  just the way some of the gals like em. I really love the veggie burger with the garlic flavored bun  omg  so  so  sooo good!!! The prices are reasonable  my friend always has a coupon  and they have a bizilion menu items to choose from! :-). The parking is horrible to me but I guess it is your typical busy mall parking!
Mark M.,Goldsboro  NC,1,2,2,11/16/2014,2.0,Good place to go for beer. Great selection on draft. Sat at the bar and service was good. However  we ate the pizza. I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store.
Natasha L.,PORTER RANCH  CA,51,22,9,7/11/2011,4.0,I went to BJs of Culver with a total party of 6. Our wait time was not too bad  couldn't have been more than 25 minutes. But  being a restuarant so well known  how could it not be packed? You don't want to wait  then go to a fast food or buffet.Our waiter was Rich(ie) and he was fantastic. Very sweet  uniform clean and crisp  very helpful. Timed our refills perfectly.Our appetizers were completely devoured  we all enjoyed our food  the drinks for those who drank were great according to them  and my drink? The Strawberry Lemonade? AMAZING.Only two reasons why it's a 4 and not 5: I made my choice of dish mainly due to price (chose one under $10). The food is great  but not -that- great. It would have to be an unique occasion for me to choose BJs if not simply for the Strawberry Lemonade and Pie-zookie.And the tables- they sat us in a booth  and I think that's too tight for 6. It seems all groups like ours were in booths and not smaller tables bunched together even though there were plenty free to do that. Don't depend on the booths too much..... Still  this particular BJs is my favorite beside the one in Burbank. Clean and attentive  and the Strawberry Lemonade doesn't taste expired or spiked with alcohol  ha.Cheers!
Yesenia D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,2,7/5/2014,2.0,I love the food but the service is Horrible! I came to this place with my fianc and the waitress never showed her face other than to present her self. When our food arrived she didn't even bother dropping off utensils so we had to wait at least 10 minutes until the bus boy came around picking up dishes. Afterwards she never came back I saw her laughing and talking around the bar with her coworkers which I thought was very unprofessional! Your getting paid to work not to socialize. The only time she came back was to drop off the bill and even then she took FOREVER to pick up the check and credit card. I honestly didn't even bother leaving a tip I am usually a big tipper but in this case she didn't deserve it. I was really disappointed  the Managers really need to hire or train these people on their customer service even the hostess they come off as snobs that don't even want to work there. I work in the restaurant business so I know how guest should be treated and how employees should act towards them. Sad to say I am not coming back here only because their customer service lacks so much but the food here is very good.
Ashlee C.,Venice  CA,0,10,,9/24/2012,5.0,I have dined at this location in the mall twice and both times was in awe by the service. The best service I have ever had and both times here. The place is cool and well know coorperate  which is not really my type of place  but the food is fun and good and the beers are good as well. Either way the service from 2 different male servers i had was so helpful nice and fun.
STEW E.,Marina del Rey  CA,9,47,3,6/29/2013,5.0,"Loved iT! Had a wonderful dining experience WITH THE KIDS!! Great attentive waiter - ERNESTO -  literally every time I looked up he was there! it was fantastic  I was very pleased. I highly recommend asking for Ernesto  he could spot the fact that my ""medium"" steak was a little overcooked even before I said anything he offered to cook another one! GREAT SERVICE!!!"
Christopher T.,Culver City  CA,62,38,17,1/11/2011,4.0,I usually only come for happy hour  but the deep dish is great! The beers are awsome! And the prices are good. Bar is always packed even late and the game(s) always on.
Lauren Y.,Culver City  Los Angeles  CA,190,27,,5/12/2013,1.0,Having been a waiter for so many years then managing a restaurant  I have extreme patience for customer service. I ordered to go over the phone (put in hold for 10 mins) and was told 20 mins but 45 minutes after waiting I was told only my Caesar salad was done but neither of my pizzas. Even though the manager was standing right next to me  he did nothing. Terrible customer service but great food. I hope other locations value customer service much better than here. Extremely disappointed. The least they could have done is tell all the people after me that it would take more than 15 minutes for their order to be ready...
Robert G.,Los Angeles  CA,159,264,24,6/17/2012,2.0,BJ's has good food  BUT this Culver City location is one of the worst restaurants to goto when it comes to getting seated. Multiple times we've come here for birthday dinners only having to wait for shy over an hour to be seated every time we've been here. EVERY TIME. I sincerely hate coming here to this particular location
Nino P.,Culver City  CA,114,165,262,9/19/2012,2.0,Food and dining experience is average. Staff need to improve on customer service. I just feel some of them are out of control and inexperienced. Waiter messed up our order  slow and was not personable. I don't see myself returning anytime soon. Lots of alternative places.
Mario S.,Los Angeles  CA,74,329,9,3/11/2010,3.0,Yes  this place is part of a chain (feels like a warmer version of Chili's)  which I usually steer around. But it's good for you business types (I am usually one of those) to get together for beers after work (huge selection). Good bar  appetizer menu  too. 3-stars for all that.The meals are kind of borderline. 2-stars for that.But the service is terrific. When the waiter noticed me peeling the ham off my grilled cheese (I'm a vegetarian that doesn't do a very thorough job of reading menus)  instead of laughing  the guy orders me a fresh  meat-less sandwich AND fetches me refill on my tomato soup. That was so uncalled for  so awesome.
Elvis P.,Santa Monica  CA,186,185,43,3/4/2013,2.0,We decided to stop by this evening after filming in Compton. The waiter disappeared for over 30 minutes and it wasn't because of a crowd since the place was about empty. The food is fine  but when it takes longer to place an order than to eat the shit  it pisses me off. It was getting to the point where we started doing the #rd Rock from the Sun thing with the tip. Put a stack of cash on the table and every time they screw up  the stack shrinks.
Debbie L.,Canterbury  New Zealand,0,1,,11/30/2013,1.0,I was not impressed with the Caesar salad I had. First it was brought out as a side salad then a dinner size with the chicken I ordered but it had no dressing on it. I had to go find the waiter to get some dressing. As a salad it wasn't much for the $12.75 price
Terenna T.,Los Angeles  CA,368,171,84,3/20/2013,3.0,This is a pretty good place. Came here and it fills so overcrowded all the time. The seating arrangements are terrible. Get there early because finding a parking space near the restaurant aint happening  unless you do valet. So if u pass valet and the entryway to the structure  you will find parking on the southside of the lot. This server was great  she was funny and relaxed  which made the whole experience good  since over packed places usually piss me off. The food was good  but what especially enjoyed that made me stop in my tracks  were the Thai Wraps Appetizer  they were great and fresh tasting. So  this is a good place for happy hour  but NO romantic dinners  ever.
Lauren B.,Austin  TX,716,426,206,6/28/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Dropped from 4 to a 2. Yep that just happened. I was with the fam and we went to visit grandpa at the cemetery on fathers day and decided to grab a bite afterward and due to the incredibly close proxmity to the graveyard  we decided to go to BJs.Our appetizer flatbread was too mushy... I've tried it before and it was definitely 5 star worthy.. this one  not so much.Also  I was not a huge fan of the shrimp lettuce wraps since each person got 3 or so measly shrimps(arn't most shirmps)... next time I will opt for the chicken. Lastly  the service was SLOOOOW! I understand that its fathers day but common... Oh ya  I was taking some stuff to-go and I had to ask for a bag to put my boxes since there were none in their normal place. The waitress had to hunt them down from elsewhere. To be realistic  even though the experience was not up to par  I will be coming back and the food and service will probably be good...
Trisha F.,Los Angeles  CA,82,55,5,8/1/2012,4.0,I can see how BJs can get a bum rap on yelp-busy waitstaff  over crowded lobby- etc. But I think it's that way with most large chain establishments. I  however  had a great experience with BJs today. I made a large party reservation and even had to book the buffet. I called numerous times to make sure everything was going according to planned. The managers were always polite and informed. During our event at BJs  the wait staff was fabulous! All my 48 guests were never hungry or thirsty. The buffet was always replenished with hot food in a matter of seconds. And even though we were to only have our event for 2 hours  we went *a little over time* and were not hassled at all. I appreciate the staff at BJs. I know how difficult it is to make a group of people happy  and they certainly pulled it off.
Patty A.,Los Angeles  CA,356,191,36,2/6/2013,4.0,I went in for lunch and as usual  BJ's doesn't disappoint. I mean I guess there is nothing tooo special for me when it comes to BJ's. I got a salad and sandwich with water. The prices are reasonable and our server was nice. Overall it was a good experience.
Silvia V.,Los Angeles  CA,2,19,10,5/11/2013,1.0,The service was terrible. Food was ok. Not worth going back.
Larry L.,Culver City  CA,57,136,1,2/3/2013,2.0,Average chain food that makes some of the most disgusting pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Seriously.
Michelle J.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,10,,11/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Okay so I went back to BJ\'s this past Friday. Totally different experience. My mom knocked over two glasses of water that were on the table spilling it all over her lap  on the floor. You get the picture. We told the server who said he was going to get someone. Five minutes  ten minutes....no one came. My mom  soaking wet  had to go to the host  who in turn found someone to clean up the mess. Then my mom ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken with the Brussels sprouts and I ordered the Mahi Mahi with Pineapple Fried Rice. It wasn\'t even close to the first time experience. Maybe a different chef. The icing on the cake  my pineapple fried rice turned out to be rice pilaf. We shared this with the manager  who proceeded to look at my plate and said  ""It looks like brown rice to me. They just forgot the pineapple."" I know what brown rice taste like and it wasn\'t brown rice. He did bring me a side of the brown rice and a side of the pineapple....whatever. At that point  I was done. He then had a discussion with my mom on how she was probably mistaken the last time she was there because that is how they always serve her dish. Really???? My mom was so excited to go back there and to share her first experience with my grandmother  who was with us. Very disappointing. The reason I\'m giving them 2 stars....our new server  that took over for the one that let my mom sit in water  was amazing. I don\'t remember his name. He\'s a law student at UCLA and I believe he is from Texas."
Paul G.,Los Angeles  CA,20,39,4,9/6/2012,4.0,Pretty good overall. A somewhat upscale place to eat with vague hints of its origins (or alternate identity) as a sports bar  with a series of video monitors near the ceilings and a multiscreen matrix of several video feeds installed over the bar (which I am confident becomes one massive television screen for the major sporting events). The scampi pasta was very good.
Nick S.,Manhattan Beach  CA,432,142,63,6/1/2012,4.0,I'm trying to avoid the chain restaurants  but came here by virtue of a business meeting schedule by a colleague. The client's office was close by  and she insisted even if we didn't like it  the most important attendee was a fan so we needed to oblige him. (I have to say that in the voice voice of Lt. Aldo Raine - Inglorious Bastards). I showed up early and the parking situation didn't look great. There was a garage and my assumption was the walk would take me into some department store labyrinth so I avoided it and the only other close spots were carry out only (at least open spots). So I ended up parking next to some ignoramus that didn't realize those white lines where the children's coloring book equivalent of what you need to stay in when parking your car. Needless to say the spot was open for this very same reason so maybe I should have thanked the douche  but I couldn't bring myself to do it. All this led me with a desire to wash the already sour taste in my mouth out with a cold beer  but the hostess did it with a smile and welcoming hello when I walked in. I let her know I was waiting for a few others to arrive  but rather than sit around with twirling her hair  she readied a table for us while I waited. That was pretty cool!The server was a doll  and knew exactly what she was doing. Convinced all of us to order specialty drinks that we had no interest in (I went with a strawberry lemonade)  and then went through the specialty items. The southern fried chicken hit my salivating glands before my brain had to time to analyze  and it was a great choice! The lemonade was super sweet  so I had to chase it with a water but that was my only complaint inside the doors. I wish this restaurant was in a nicer location with better parking  but hey it's a chain. The service and food was delish and therefore  I'll be back to probably that and other BJ's so to indulge again in no time. Maybe these chain restaurants have something to them after all...
Jennifer H.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,5,7,15,8/13/2012,1.0,"I had made a reservation for my birthday on a Monday my birthday was on a Thursday  early that Thursday I got a call to confirm for 8:30 and when I walked in at8:10 and spoke to the host and said I was waiting for my party which was 10 of us she said it was fine to just walk in at 8:30 when I get there the ""manager or host"" whoever the fuck he was said my reservation was at 8. I was very upset this was the last thing I wanted to hear. People with smaller parties were getting sat like nothing. And here we are with a reservation waiting and waiting. We got a table at 9 then the waitress just walked away like aren\'t you suppose to offer me a drink? when she finally decided to come back I asked for appetizers which we never got and she took 15 minutes to get our drinks. It took 40 minutes to get our food by that time I was irritated and over it. I won\'t come here again with a large party. The food was eeeh could be better! The only good thing about this place were the Very Berry Margaritas!p.s the floor is very slippery!"
Jena S.,Los Angeles  CA,703,571,260,3/28/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"Alright BJs  you have officially won me (and Mr. Midnight) over. And no  it\'s not because of that one bartender that\'s in the know... but its your combination of a few things that are the way to most everyman\'s heart:Good Beer & Great Mac & Cheese!After a debaucherous night out we headed to the mall to get something for his nieces birthday. We both turned to eachother as we walked and said: we want beer!I was hungry too though. We saw a sign that said ""2.95 bites and samples.."" I ordered some mac & cheese. We had no idea how orgasmic that was going to be. The wait. The anticipation...(Why was it taking so long to get our beer & some mac & cheese?)When it arrived  it was a pretty big portion. He wasn\'t hungry originally... that was until he saw that it was covered in bacon... and that there were hidden pieces of bacon inside the cheese itself. Orgasmic! Definitely will be coming back for more of that.As it was the 2nd time we were here  and we were pleased with what we ordered  the service could be much better. It was a bit slower than I\'d have liked but that could have been partially due to the night befores festivities."
Danielle B.,Los Angeles  CA,16,11,1,3/24/2014,1.0,"Well according to our receipt our server was ginee. She forgot our appetizer and never came over to say anything we had to stop her and mention it. She said she forgot and we didn\'t get it at all. When we got our food it was cold and had to wait about 10 more minutes for hot fries and it was another server who helped us with that by asking how out food was because ginee was still no where to be found. She told us we could pick a dessert on the house. Finally when she checked in saying she had already chose a few different desserts for us. Which whatever but like any normal girl I would like to choose my own dessert. Well when we got the dessert it was one of the mini cookies that usually come in threes. We got one cookie and one spoon. So much for the ""few different"" desserts. Nothing was taken off of our bill and the attempt at a free dessert was sort of pathetic. At least give us a whole dessert if nothing else. We won\'t be returning."
Eileen F.,Culver City  CA,3,45,6,6/12/2013,2.0,Friendly Customer Service. Good wait staff.The food is below mediocre. I live near by and it seems that as time has gone on the food has gotten worse. They are known for their pizzas but often times it has been dry or overcooked. Ive tried different dishes and drinks and they just fail to impress. My recommendation is DON'T BOTHER!
Amber B.,Compton  CA,12,43,96,6/19/2012,2.0,"I decided to have dinner with one of my friends at this location about a week ago. We arrived on a somewhat busy night. So  I didn\'t mind waiting 15-20 minutes for our table. We were finally seated & our waiter took our order. I ordered a ""MEDIUM pizza"" and my friend ordered the pasta dish. He brought us our drinks and soon after returned with our food and another waitress. I looked at my pizza and said  ""this isn\'t a medium. I ordered a medium."" My waiter\'s attitude completely changed. He abruptly responded with "" YOU ORDERED THE MINI PIZZA!! I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED A MINI PIZZA AND YOU SAID YES!!! I REPEATED YOUR ORDER AND YOU SAID OK!!!"" I then explained  "" I heard you say medium and that\'s why I responded yes."" He haughtily responded  ""WELL THAT\'S YOUR ORDER RIGHT THERE!!!!(pointing at the mini pizza on the table) AND ANYWAY THIS IS YOUR NEW WAITRESS  SHE\'LL BE TAKING OVER FOR ME!!!"" I assume that it was a shift change and this jackass was ready to go home because he seemed to fly away from us at top speed. The whole time he was ranting about my pizza the new waitress looked equally as offended as my friend and I. I never once raised my voice above normal speaking level. I just wanted what I ordered. I didn\'t mind waiting for that to happen. ALEX OR ALEJANDRO immediately went off on defensive rant. I felt COMPLETELY disrespected and the waitress could tell. She began to try to fix the situation and I asked to see the manager. She went to find him and he shortly returned. I assume she explained the situation because he was completely apologetic and told me my MEDIUM pizza was being prepared as we spoke. My problem was not with the error it was how Alex handled it. He overreacted on a rational person. I don\'t know where the mix up actually happened. It could have been him not speaking clearly or writing down the wrong thing."
Lee P.,Portland  OR,17,46,16,3/16/2012,2.0,"Sigh... we were in the mall in Culver City on a retail sales assessment and were starving  so we decided to get something to eat at BJ\'s. I\'d never heard of BJ\'s (we don\'t have any in Portland  at least that I know of)  so I was neutral on the choice. When we walked in it was big  set up with a bar area with a lot of TVs  and then spilled out into a dining area. My first impression was... oh... this place is like a Chilis/TGI-Fridays/CheesecakeFactory/Applebees/on/and-on/and-on.  ...a chain restaurant with pre-packaged food so they can support the giant menu listing (heavy sigh). I know this kind of food. It all tastes \'okay\'  but very artificial and pre-prepared. Knowing this  I went with the healthiest option that looked good: a flatbread veggie pizza with a salad. It was \'meh\'... not bad  but \'meh\'. My coworker had a little personal pepperoni pizza and some sort of a side. He didn\'t eat all his pizza and didn\'t want to waste the rest  so he asked if I could eat some. I tried it and it was like \'POP\' in my mouth... a shock of ""FLAVOR""  and that was from just the crust. Pizza crust is supposed to be a little doughy  yeasty  and earthy... not slap you in the face with zing. I usually eat a pretty healthy and clean diet  so when I get food with artificial flavoring  especially MSG  it usually sticks out. This time it nearly slapped me in the mouth. Blech. I don\'t want to eat that stuff. I can\'t taste the real flavor and know if it\'s good or not... it\'s processed and loaded with enough flavor enhancers that it\'ll ""taste good""  but it doesn\'t register as real taste  but more so overly intense and enhanced.All in all  it got us through lunch  but I\'m not a fan. It\'s \'meh\'... and some menu items are \'blech\'. Doubt I\'ll ever be back to one unless it\'s solely to watch a game and have a beer with friends.One thing that\'s always a bummer about these places is that they do have a nice environment... big booths  a cool open bar with tons of TVs to hang out and view. Now if they could just shake the big corporate supply chain and food preparation and turn it into a local place with fresh  healthy  local  homemade food  I\'d be all over it."
Danielle B.,Los Angeles  CA,93,412,21,1/6/2013,4.0,They do not take reservations so be careful of when you go. Our waitress  Diana  was amazing. We ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken (get extra sauce)  Boneless chicken wings  Cobb sandwich  Shrimp tacos  Classic Cheese Burger  Chicken tenders  and the artichoke dip. The only thing I did not like was the artichoke dip. I also ordered a Hefeweizen and did not get a lemon. Why do they want me to try it without? It was easy to split the bill with others.
Daisy C.,Los Angeles  CA,317,193,540,2/4/2010,2.0,Food isn't terrible. Not like I've never been to a Bj's before. But waiting 30 minutes for water? pssshht I think not.Really  30 minutes for water with no silverware on our table. I don't mind eating with my hands  but drinking soup is a different story. Waiters? Waitresses? Who's who? I don't even know who was serving me. Once the host/hostess sits you down  you won't meet your server until 10 minutes later.I eat like a hippo  so when I don't get my food pronto  I turn into a big baby who needs her milk. Damn my fingers were tapping and our server was NO WHERE to be seen.Yeah the restaurant may seem busy  but it's just a bunch of eaters who's trying to flag down their servers to bring the check. Sadly  I will return. Not much restaurants around the mall  but hey there's a bird pick tea & herb right when you walk in the mall near BJ's entrance!! yay!!!Love me some Bird Pick. Sorry BJ's.bon appetit.
Yogi V.,Gilroy  CA,23,13,31,5/10/2012,3.0,Extremely Slow service. Took forever for food to arrive. For the time it took the food was so so.  Last time I spend money there.
Jeff G.,Los Angeles  CA,204,62,3,12/9/2009,2.0,"This place makes me feel like an abused house wife who keeps coming back... ""its alright baby that was the past  I\'ve changed baby  its okay... I wont hurt you.""But every time I keep coming back and its worse than before. Like tonight. 40 minute wait for a table after they tell us 20: check. another 35 minute wait for appetizers: check. Dinner showing up less than a minute after said appetizers: check.The experience was awful  that is until my below room-temperature pizza showed up. Never has any restaurant captured the delicacy of left over pizza so well. ...hey assholes if I wanted cold pizza I could make it myself using my fucking fridge.Anyways as I type this on my phone I\'m still here waiting for my check... Slowly slipping into insanity. Tell my mother I love her."
Maryam M.,Los Angeles  CA,5,23,14,3/29/2012,1.0,The burgers were AWFUL!! They weren't seasoned at all. Even the manager admitted that the bacon was undercooked! Even with the burgers off the bill  2 beers  stuffed mushrooms and a single bowl of chowder was over $30!! Never again!!
Fanon P.,Los Angeles  CA,215,388,248,5/12/2010,4.0,Okay first of all my fellow yelpers my rating is based on the alcohol not the food here!!! I give the food three stars  but this is about those kick ass beers & lagers they have. Man those things will knock you right on your bum  I had jerimiahs red mixed with the berry cider. So good I want to drink that everyday and become and alcoholic because of it!My uncles from England and he loves his fair share of snakebites & what not  if your into that type of stuff this place will float your boat. the service here is really good too. Its nice and spacious and made just for large party's it seems.Okay the food... the pizza doesn't excite me  the pasta is okay but gets boring quick  sandwiches are okay  burgers are pretty good! Apps are good to I had the calamari and it was pretty tasty. Though After one of those Jermiah reds the table cloth will probably taste good too? Hey but its all about the beer here beer beer and more beer. They let you sample all kinds too! So go there and be a lush! get a snake bite!
Eric M.,Colorado Springs  CO,0,14,,9/7/2010,4.0,"My wife and I had a GREAT dinner and drinks here over the weekend. She really liked her fish tacos  and I LOVED my pot roast sandwich (one of their ""Knife and Fork Sandwiches""). I loved every single detail about my food. We each had one of their specialty beers  which were very good. There was lots of waiters  and our service was very good. Even the music on the P.A. was very good. We parked in the parking structure of the mall (this restaurant is on the north end of this large fancy mall. There\'s the option of dropping off passengers at the restaurant\'s door  or using the valet. Referring to someone elses review ... If you\'re afraid of black people  then screw you anyway! I\'m an average white guy ... who cares about race! It\'s a very nice restaurant  and a very nice mall  in a nice neighborhood."
Meredith T.,Los Angeles  CA,28,54,4,5/3/2013,4.0,We had Oscar in the bar area & he was wonderful! Things were taking a bit long but as soon as we let him know we were on a tight timeframe  everything moved much faster. I would definitely sit in his section again.
DL W.,Los Angeles  CA,91,28,,1/26/2013,4.0,I know this place has had some bad reviews  but I really wanted a good beer and a little bar food while running a bunch of errands at the Westfield Mall. I sat at the bar where a very helpful bartender helped me choose one of the house beers on special. It was a very lovely red beer. I had the boneless wings with the hot sauce and a Caesar salad. The salad was perfectly dressed with just the right amount of cheese and croutons that weren't rock hard. I liked the boneless wings  too. The chicken was tender and juicy. There was a nice crispy coating. But the sauce about burned my lips off. I'm a lightweight where spice is concerned. I know people who would love that. Still  they were good enough that I nearly finished them. I found the service was prompt and friendly. I really liked the bartender. I can easily see myself returning.
Cathy K.,Orange County  CA,600,427,77,10/23/2009,2.0,If ever I'm in dire need of... oh... say a few hundred thousand dollars... this is where you'll find me.The place is a lawsuit waiting to happen.From start to finish  I feared for my life as I barely managed to maintain my balance on the slippery slick floors. Either they'd JUST gotten a fresh wax job  or the floor must be caked in grease. I didn't look closely enough to figure it all out  but what's important is  if I didn't possess crazy ninja balancing skills  I would've broken my neck on multiple occasions.That being said...The pizza  beer  pizookie  and service were on par with any other BJs I've ever been to.Again  just watch out for the floors. Definitely don't venture there unless your feet are encased in hardcore rubber soled shoes.Consider yourselves warned.
Amanda n Roger C.,Oxnard  CA,0,6,,8/23/2011,4.0,My husband loves this place for watcing a game and having a beer. It's a little loud for my tastes though. But I do like some of their homemade draft beers. Their food is decent. They have flatbread pizzas for 1/2 price between certain times and they are delicious. Could use a little more toppings on them but they taste great! They have deep fried artichoke hearts that are good too  and I love their Garlic salad dressing and homemade croutons. It's not so great when trying to wait for a seat in the general restaurant area so we usually end up sitting in the bar area when we come here. I wish there was a 3 1/2 star rating  but I'll round up since they are slightly better than 3 star in my opinion. Just depends on when you go.Parking sucks because it's located in the mall and there's not enough spaces on their end  and who wants to pay for valet at a sports bar??But overall BJ's is worth checking out  and try the Mediterranean flatbread pizza when you do! :)
May Z.,San Gabriel  CA,2,90,9,1/7/2013,5.0,We three girls tried this place days ago  had a great time. We went about dinner time  and waited for like 20 minutes. The staff were all very friendly. We ordered (forgot what exactly  lol) the appetizer combo  a Thai pizza  a dessert  and some other stuff  lol...All very tasty. It's a very busy place  great for friends and family.
Diana M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,6,,9/5/2014,1.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'S twice  and both times I experienced bad customer service. I placed my order online and once I arrived none of the employees acknowledged me. About 10 minutes past when I decide to ask for help and a employee said ""just wait there"". Okay  another 5 minutes later I was still waiting. Then another employee tells me to go the bar to ask for my order. (I\'m thinking..isn\'t that your job!. Okay) So I go and ask for my order at the bar and the gentlemen there doesn\'t know anything about a ""to go order"" and tries to help me with a better attitude. Seriously  it shouldn\'t take almost 20 minutes to pick up a to go order!!!. The second time I ordered  my BF went to pick it up and was told to wait for the order. His exactly text to me was ""HORRIBLE SERVICE"". Honestly  I\'ve worked in restaurants so I know exactly how situations like these could have been handled better  so I\'m not trying to be mean but this locations REALLY needs to improve in their customer service. All my coworkers stopped ordering food from this BJ\'S for the same reason. I truly don\'t recommend anyone to come here. Luckily for you there\'s many options near by  so don\'t worry!!!!"
Toni G.,Leimert Park  Los Angeles  CA,26,3,8,5/2/2012,4.0,Management  servers  host and cooks are awesome! I always have a great time here and the presentation of the food is appealing to the eye and palate. I've been here with my friends  Grandmother  and significant other and it's a restaurant that everyone can appreciate!!!
Sue Z.,Playa del Rey  Los Angeles  CA,474,451,120,10/27/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Update of that night: the food here wreaked havoc on my whole digestive system all night. random stomach pains  horrible gas (yep  i said it!). and overall feeling of shittiness. the only other time i felt this bad  was when i decided to have a late crack-ho-bell meal. skip BJ's  and go to cheesecake factory. unless your significant other finds gas sexy...
Edwin M.,Los Angeles  CA,29,13,,6/5/2011,3.0,This BJ's is...ok....?They are ALWAYS busy. No matter what time of day  they are ALWAYS busy. I've tried coming here numerous times and have only gone in once because it's always busy and the parking really really SUCKS.The servers are friendly. They're pretty attentive in consideration with the amount of tables they must serve. It's just like your average BJ's  only probably louder.I'll give this place a 3  but I'm leaning more towards a 2. The servers were the only thing I liked about this BJ's. The wait for everything was average  but when I got my Fettuccine Alfredo  it was cold and it was kind of gross and that is usually my regular dish when I go to a BJ's.
Kari S.,San Diego  CA,78,385,43,3/12/2010,2.0,"We were on our way through LA on our way home and stopped here for lunch. We have been to the BJ\'s in La Mesa so we thought we would grab some pizza for lunch. Big Mistake!! The service started out pretty good  placed our order for appetizers and our entrees. It took a half hour for out appetizer to come and out and when it did it was cold! We ordered mozzarella sticks and the cheese wasn\'t really even warm...it was like hard string cheese with a fried coating. About another twenty minutes later our entrees came out and weren\'t much better! I had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and my husband had sausage and pepperoni pizza. I think my sandwich was sitting there waiting for his pizza to get done. It was only slightly warm and the ""toasted"" bread was super greasy and soggy. My husband\'s pizza was hot  but it had tomatoes on it that he didn\'t order and it had a chemical taste to it!Such a disappointment! Waste of $42!"
Patrick O.,Redondo Beach  CA,418,607,51,10/27/2009,1.0,"No.Bj\'s has great pizza and is usually a pretty good fail safe if you should ever desire a chain experience.This location however  sucks.We showed up Saturday night to grab dinner just before heading out for the evening and the place was JAMMED  expected of course as it\'s still very new.Instead of waiting we opted for the bar because it\'s first come  first serve - obviously the quicker choice.10 minutes go by  no table. 20 minutes  no table. 30 minutes  table is about to leave boo-yah! Table doesn\'t leave  they just hang out and talk  grrrrrrThen it gets better  this blonde woman who literally just walked in walks up talks to the people whom have seen me eyeballing them for the past 30 minutes and just claims the table. I\'m mindblown at this point  did she just really do that? So additional friends arrive and then when starting to ask about the table that\'s leaving behind me this woman has the nerve to get catty with me and say ""That table is ours"".Listen lady  I may be from Colorado but you just made Ari Gold come out full force.""Oh it\'s okay"" I say  ""It\'s not like you haven\'t seen me waiting here the entire time"" to which she snickers.Well  what\'s a guy do when cat claws are being thrown at him?He bites back like a rabid dog.I then look at the bartender and say ""Round of beers for that table on me  don\'t tell them who it\'s from though"" Heh-heh  looks like her table is now stuck for another 15 minutes or so to which in that time  we all get seats at the bar  I love how Karma works.This place is now on my shit list for assholes  I\'ll go to the other locations if I\'m wanting it that bad."
Tameka H.,Los Angeles  CA,121,277,50,2/2/2010,3.0,Uuuumm... parking sucks !Valet dude won't tell you that its full. Expects you to be a psychic.Wait time is half an hour.I got love for BJ's cuz they have good food but this location sucks.
Darla K.,Burbank  CA,35,50,5,11/20/2010,3.0,I like BJ's  I go quite a lot with my husband and our friend. We always get the same thing. Their Parmesan Crusted Chicken is out of this world good! I absolutely love it!! My husband always gets the Baby Back Ribs  but the last time he decided to be adventurous and try something new. I don't think he'll do that again! He got one of the Pasta dishes and it was horrible to the point he didn't eat and didn't want anything else. So I give them 3 stars for our fav dishes  plus the pazookies  but not so great for their other food.
Charles D.,Los Angeles  CA,37,48,13,10/9/2011,1.0,"My God. Why me?We went to Target to get some toys and clothes for our 20 month old boy and since it was 6:30 pm thought we\'d drop by BJs for dinner. I\'d been to the one in Westwood many a time and always had great food  beer and service. We had no reason to expect anything different from this BJs.Good lord  what a nightmare!Things started off promising. The hostess took our name and said it would be a ""minute or two.""That is the last time they were accurate about anything.Eric S.  our waiter  a seemingly affable young chap took us to our table and said he\'d get us a high chair ""right away."" Well  five minutes isn\'t too bad. We were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Then he told us about the specials and took our beer orders. We asked him for water since our baby boy\'s sippy cup was almost empty. He assured us we\'d get it. After about fifteen minutes our beers came. We asked again about the water. He assured us we\'d get it then took our pizza orders. Twenty minutes later our pizza arrives. No water. Our kid eats some of the not-so-tasty and dry pizza and is getting thirsty. I ask the busboy if he would give us water  saying our kid is real thirsty. He says he\'ll get some ""right away."" It\'s been about a f*cking hour and no one has come by to give us water!!??? WTF? Our waiter comes back and we tell him we want water and crayons for our kid. He comes back with the crayons and apologizes for forgetting the water. IS THERE A F*CKING SHORTAGE OF WATER IN BJS\' or something??? We\'d be happy to pay for extra. Finally  my wife  in disgust  gets up and walks to the bar where -- surprise! -- she runs into our water who  I guess  finally got tired of hearing us request this and was getting our water. She takes it from him and comes back.The waiter comes back and take another drink order from me and says our special comes with a dessert so we ask for the pazookie. By now  we put the pizza away in a box -- not too impressed with it. Very dry.10 minutes go by. 20. Finally my 2nd beer arrives. Another 20 minutes go by and still not damn dessert. It\'s been at least half an hour since he took the order. In irritation I get up to the hostess and tell her to cancel our dessert we want our check and want it now. It is now 2.5 hours since we arrived. The waiter comes by fifteen minutes later with a vague apology and a smirk and starts to walk away. I say  ""hold on dude. I\'m 45 years old. I\'ve been going to restaurants since I was five. I\'ve been to London. I\'ve been to Paris. I\'ve been to NYC - I\'ve been to Vietnam. I\'ve been to Hong Kong. And this  my friend  is the WORST service I\'ve ever had in my life.""He wants to know why and I tell him about the water fiasco; he has the nerve to say  ""well I met your wife at the bar"" -- what an idiot! I say  ""yes  you did but we had asked your and your busboy FOUR TIMES before you bothered to get it."" He apologizes and says something stupid about the ""system crashing."" Why do waiters always use that excuse? Like that stopped them from serving water? I sign the bill  see that nothing was comped and give the guy no tip. Thanks for nothing  BJs."
Melissa E.,Ridgecrest  CA,89,83,56,8/2/2012,3.0,The service is always mediocre here and I always get the same thing because I'm nervous they'll screw up my food like they did the first time I visited this location. My burger practically got up  moo'd at me  and walked away it was so rare ... I ordered medium done ... so now I only order pizza or a salad. The waiters are young and seem like they have little to no experience. If I'm gonna get bad service I'd rather go to the sushi joint around the corner and get bad service with my delish sushi. IJS.
Lok Man F.,Playa del Rey  CA,77,163,249,10/28/2009,1.0,Bad experience on a Friday night! My husband and I went to BJs when it was 6pm  but the line was already long. We waited for 35 minutes before getting to sit down. After we sat down  we waited for more than 10 minutes. Our server has not shown up at all. Another server came by and brought us drinks and took our orders. Finally  our server came by after 15 minutes and told us that he has put in the orders for us. We ordered calamari for appetizer  a mini pizza  a chili baked potatoes  and a side of caesar salad. After 20 minutes  our appetizer still didn't come! We were so hungry and not happy. At the end  food was here. But there were only pizza and potato. I told the server that our appetizer and our salad were not here yet. The server came back and told us that those orders were not in. My husband got mad and told him to cancel both. The server knew that it was bad  so he went in and brought us the salad after 10 minutes. The music was loud  and the room was cold. The food was ok  but not great at all. We waited for that long and we were not full at all. When we got the check  we saw that the salad didn't count on the receipt. That's the only thing that we were happy about. Overall  it was a horrible night. I hope this is because the place is new open  that's why everything is horrible. I may go there again after a few months. But that will be the last chance.
Bob L.,Laramie  WY,11,259,6,11/26/2012,5.0,Brought a date here. She liked it and I liked it too. The night ended a great success! ;)
Jess P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,4,3/29/2010,1.0,BJ's BJ's BJ's... The first time visit  I went with a couple of friends  horrible service! The guy was ignoring me and even forgot my drink! wow. I almost ate it due to their slippery floors! I don't know why I went back but I did. The second time I went  totally different waiter  horrible service too! She forgot to give us our utensils and hardly came around. I'm not the only one that has experienced horrible service at BJ's  I know other people that have had the same experience. A thing I most add as well  their food isn't even that great! Sorry but got nothing good to say about this restaurant. Never going back again  that's for sure.
Wallace R.,Inglewood  CA,50,7,3,10/23/2011,1.0,Found a bug crawling in the salad. Manager took 50% off the bill and offered a sincere apology. Not enough for us so this was our last visit.
Jacob P.,Venice  CA,38,60,59,10/12/2012,4.0,We came on a Wednesday  there was a wait. Bathroom smelled like p--. Service was Excellent. Food  beer  delicious. I like things a little sweet so  I feel the orange cream soda could use a little more cream.
K B.,Simi Valley  CA,0,13,,6/16/2013,2.0,Like others that have reviewed this restaurant  I have been to other BJ's and I have always had a great experience. But this was not a good meal experience. To be fair  our waitress was very good. She was friendly  considerate enough to check up on us through our meal  and even brought us Father's Day glasses when I didn't know they were giving them out.Where things fell apart was with the hostess  other wait staff and food.First  I walked up to the hostess stand and the hostess and some gentleman were doing something on the computer. Rather than acknowledge me  or let me know they would be right with me  they ignored me and kept doing what they were doing. After several minutes of standing there  they finally helped me.Second  the wait staff didn't seem to know where an order needed to go. One staff member brought another table's order to our table. A waiter brought one of our lunches to a different table. I guess they don't know table numbers or something. And why they didn't bring all our items at the same time  I don't know. Instead  we had three different waiter/waitresses bring us our food at different times.Third  two staff members moved an empty table that was located behind me to another part of the restaurant. However  when they pulled out the chairs to get access to the table  they left the chairs where they were--which was right behind me. I mean directly behind me; I couldn't scoot my chair back to get out. I had to ask my waitress to move the chairs when she came to check on us.Lastly  the quality of the food was below what I am used to at a BJ's. We ordered the calamari appetizer and the portion was small (not worth the $10 they charge even if it was good -- which it wasn't). I ordered a roast beef sandwich and my fries were soggy because the au jous sauce was all over my plate. One daughter had the lettuce wraps and the lettuce they used just fell apart making it impossible to eat; another daughter ordered the jalapeo burger which was burnt on the edges and only had three jalapeos on it; and then my third daughter ordered fettuccine alfredo which was pure butter. The alfredo sauce was more butter than anything else and the garlic bread was dripping with butter. Totally gross.We will definitely never return here and recommend you never go there either. BJ's corporate office needs to do a makeover here in terms of it's staff. There are some serious issues here.
B M.,Los Angeles  CA,16,23,3,8/3/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"So I decided to give this place another chance....BAD IDEA! Customer Service was horrible  and everyone seemed confused. Let me be more specific the Take Out service was horrible! Maybe I\'m being a bit presumptuous to assume the take out server would be friendly and hospitable  instead I got ""go ahead and tell me what u want."" The food was mediocre  not worth me returning. If I visit or recommend a BJ\'s Restaurant it won\'t be this location."
Don R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,60,,6/11/2013,3.0,This time I ordered the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl. Excellent  maybe better than the place on the pier in San Francisco. The two beers I ordered to take home were 50% more expensive than last time. Not cool. Otherwise I was happy with my dining experience. I was really hungry and didn't want to wait fifteen minutes to be seated at the olive garden
Shalene W.,Los Angeles  CA,16,66,3,2/20/2010,2.0,The service is sloooooooowwwwww....... Do not go here if you are hungry or in a hurry. My last encounter at this BJs lasted 4 hours! (1 hour to get a table  35 minutes to find a waiter to take our drink order  another 30+ minutes before the drinks arrived and they took our food order  ....)The food  the environment  and the prices are good. The slow service and lack of attention to customers is really dragging this place down.
Paul G.,Los Angeles  CA,26,30,5,2/5/2014,1.0,Most horrible front service people! I arrived before 3pm...Very few people in the place..hostess was who knows where  she finally comes dragging her feet to talk to us...Short overweight latin a girl. She said we could sit by the bar...i normally never like to sit by the bar because you don't get a fast service  I asked how long the wait  she replied 10 mins  I said it let's wait. 15 mins came and finally she took us to a table right next to the only party of people having a meeting. I asked polite if we could see 2 tables down so it wouldn't be so noisy. She said you can sit in the bar...i told her there are all those tables empty I am only asking to sit further. She said I would have to wait. I got upset and just sat down in the table she put us at. Pretty silly but man the nerve and rudeness. I have business and if my stuff would ever do this to my clientele I would fire them up on the spot. Learn maners BJ and respect your clients that pay for a service!
Kat K.,Los Angeles  CA,1028,411,554,10/30/2009,1.0,I was sorely disappointed. Friday night  as expected  drew crowds from all over to this BJ's. This location is a nice size - considerably larger than the one I frequent in Westwood. I figured because all the tables were full  and there were plenty of people waiting outside to be seated  this BJ's must be jammin'. I was wrong. BJ's has mostly been a reliable chain with great food and decent service. I figured that this particular location would not be an exception  but the events that unfolded tonight proved otherwise. It only took us about 20 minutes wait to get seated at 8pm. When we were seated  a cheery server greeted us and took our drink orders. Her demeanor was warm and welcoming  though she seemed a little flustered and pre-occupied. She came back to take our orders shortly after dropping some checks at other tables.  My friend and I sat nursing our waters while we hungrily awaited our food and eyed servers walking by our tables with trays of food for other patrons.Our food did not arrive for an hour. By the time we had received our food  tables that were seated 10 minutes after us received their food 20 minutes before us  and the fries  BBQ chicken sliders  and pizza that we had ordered were barely warm. We had just enjoyed our first sliders when the other groups seated after us finished eating and left for the night.Our server graciously offered to have a manager speak with us  to which I agreed. After discussing the fact that we received food in an hour while other groups were being served much faster  the manager offered to zap our cold pizza in the oven and comp our meal. She seemed to expect to see me jump up and dance at this offer  but I did not give her the satisfaction of doing so. I was still eating my fries and sliders cold  dammit.First impressions are important. While the location can hide behind the name of a good chain or brand  they still have much to prove since they are new  after all. From a consumer's perspective  it was nice to have a free meal. But BJ's is a business  and no business should have to comp meals and lose money for the sake of bad service.
Raquel R.,Los Angeles  CA,348,500,313,7/16/2012,3.0,Stopped in for a quick lunch while shopping at the mall. The service was a little slow at first but the waiter started to hustle a bit. Mediocre food  nothing special  I had the asian chicken salad and a lite beer.
K V.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,5/5/2011,5.0,I lOVE BJS....The Oreo Pizookie is a Killer... Amazing dessert!! The Thai Salmon...Geeezzzzz... Ufffff Over the Top. I love this Rest... Wowww
Dan E.,Culver City  Los Angeles  CA,1,24,,2/15/2013,1.0,Worst customer service! They take forever to seat you. Every time I have come here it's the same thing..
Pam M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,57,14,7/20/2010,4.0,mmmmm  pizzookie!Not to mention  I have heard that a portion of the proceeds goes to benefit CFF (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation).
ryan D.,Marina del Rey  CA,3,40,1,2/24/2010,1.0,I was so excited when they finally opened a BJs on the West Side. I use to go to the one in Woodland Hills when I lived in the Valley and the food was always good there  very consistent. The BJS beer has gotten better and way more consistent since they dont brew the beer at the locations anymore.This BJs is an entirely different story. I've stupidly given the place four tries. Maybe one out of the four times the food was acceptable. The last time was the last time. Never again for food.I ordered a classic burger and my girlfriend ordered one of their flatbread pizzas. The burger came out totally over done  even the bun was burnt. I told them to make it dry  no mayo no butter on the bread. The bun was saturated in griddle fry. I've worked in a restaurant before and its not butter  ITS GRIDDLE FRY  nasty shit you dont want to eat  and the bun was burnt to shit. I took one bite and immediately sent it back. The server was shocked : WEEEEELLL whats wrong with you burger sir?ummm pay attention and youd know is what I was thinking!!! You literally could squeeze the bun and griddle fry would drip out YUCCCCCCCCCKKKK HORRRRRKKKKK!!!She asked if I wanted something besides the burger  I said no.My girlfriends pizza was the nastiest pizza we both have ever had. The crust is a thin crust version of Celeste frozen pizza you get at the market. She had about 1.5 of the pieces and didnt eat the rest. It had a coating of grease on the bottom of the plate  inedible. Server didn't even ask why she barely touched it..FAIL!Its in the Fox Hills mall. Not really my crowd. Parking is a nightmare. That alone doesnt make it worth going to just to go to BJs. They have one giant screen TV in the bar area thats split into quadrants  not enough TVs for a BJs bar in my opinion.BJs you failed on this location. The food is horrible and the wait staff seems very rookie  thats why you get 1 star.
Martin B.,Los Angeles  CA,1,3,,4/17/2013,3.0,One of the best places to view a game -- good people  good food and great beer!
Frank M.,Buena Park  CA,180,192,187,11/9/2009,4.0,The place is nice. I dont have much to complain about. I just know I wont come here often but the place is good.Came here with a group of about 6. They have a good selection of beer as one person had an apple flavored clear beer. It was pretty good. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Oh man  that shit was GOOOD! hmm. BUT it was packing calories like a mo-fo! but pretty much everything in this place kinda is. A friend had something that looked like a pizza but it was not under the pizza section. It was rectangular shaped and had avocados. Hmm it was the shiznit!I just looked at their website and they have MEATLOAF! haven't eaten that in a while. The waiters and service was good. not bad. And they were friendly  even one of them got in a picture we took of the group.Will come again.
Ann K.,Los Angeles  CA,6,68,7,11/10/2011,2.0,Guess I'm running with the pack. Terrible pizza. I came with a friend who seems to like this place ( I think I need a new friend) bready  no toppings  I don't know what this is but it's not deep dish pizza. Service was just fair  our server was pleasant but had to flag him down for EVERYTHING. I swear he would have never stopped. The wedge salad was OK nothing special. I truly don't get what the WAIT is about. I would never wait for this again.
Ken D.,Los Angeles  CA,126,47,59,9/20/2012,2.0,"If it wasn\'t for the Happy Hour and variety of Beer I would opt not to come to this place. I have eaten at this establishment on numerous occasions with a group as well as alone and every-time without fail the SERVICE SUCKED  NO REALLY it takes so long before someone comes to the table and even after that it takes an eternity to get the food. I think for the most part the management is not attentive enough  they are so busy trying to help out the staff and aren\'t fully aware of the real problems in the resturant. I would never tell anyone to eat here but as far as the bar I might suggest a quick and ""I mean a walk up a get it yourself QUICK BEVERAGE."
Wendy H.,Fairfield  CA,0,37,1,1/2/2013,4.0,We were on our way home from the Rose Parade and decided to stop at a restaurant I have always had a good experience at. So we booked the reservation at this location As it is close to LAX. After we booked the reservation I read the reviews that slammed the service and gave the food marginal ratings. After our experience I wanted to post this review. We had eight in our party. First the young lady answering the phone for the reservation was pleasant and helpful. Second we were greeted promptly with a smile. They gave us a nice roomy table and the service was excellent. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. She also replaced my salad even though I forgot to ask them to remove the carrots. We ordered appetizers (avocado egg rolls calamari  and potato skins). The egg rolls were great as always. The Calamari was excellent very tender and seasoned perfectly. The potato skins were just ok. Personal feet they needed more toppings and seasoning. Everyone at our table was happy with their entree especially the burgers! The best was ending the lunch with the pazuli dessert. It was simply excellent. If I am back to the area anytime soon  I will definitely come back.
John D.,Los Angeles  CA,107,49,,12/1/2009,1.0,Called in to cut my wait time in half. When I got there they said my name wasnt even on the list. I ask to speak to a manager after the host is reluctant to serve me. Waited ten minutes manager doesnt come so I speak to the host and she put me on this list and gives me a pager. I go outside and wait 30 mins. Come back and she said that they already signaled my pager. I told her it never rang. I ask her to just put me next on this list and I will wait right here and she refuses to do so. So I leave.More than an hour of waiting and no food. Very disrespectful to me and my date.I went there once before that and we waited like half an hour for seats. Then we order food which took about 50 mins to receive. People who came in after us got their food before us. My friend requested some kind of discount being that we waited almost an hour for sauceless pizza. He brings us ice cream on a cookie and expects two grown men to share it.Fuck this place.
Dawn C.,Inglewood  CA,20,35,4,8/7/2011,2.0,I've been here a few times and its the same everytime. The service is bad for mediocre food. It tastes like cafe food instead of quality food. It gets pretty loud especially when a game is on  and there's always a long wait. The very last time  everyone's food came out at different times  the food was warm when it did come  they kept bringing us stuff we didn't order and they charged us for it even though we sent it all back. What should've been a simple family outing turned into a two hour catastrophe; over an hour for everyone to get their food and another hour to get the check and settle the discrepancies. I only like the drinks and the HUGE tv for game nights! And I love no matter where you sit you can see a tv. However I prob won't be going back. I'd rather drive to westwood. No huge tv but they have much better food
Valley J.,El Segundo  CA,6,63,,10/19/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,BJs  why are you now biting me in the ass after giving you a 3 star rating? I was totally trying to pimp you out (which I thought you deserved)  but  you came back and kicked me to the curb  didn't you?First of all  you're a BREWHOUSE. One of your beers should not take 10 minutes to get. I could see the tap from my seat. PULL IT!Secondly  you burn your hamburgers. Badly. It needed a skin graft.Thirdly  don't close 25% of your seating area on a Saturday evening for a private party that had barely 20 people in it. Lastly  figure out how to work your paging system for seat assignments. It was bad enough the dude that looked like a lady tried to break in front of my wife to get a pager. But then you went and seated him BEFORE us when we had equal party members. Totally unacceptable.I may come back for the beer  but  I'm going to take the family back to CPK.
Isabella L.,Culver City  CA,107,425,7,3/9/2010,4.0,This is your standard upscale sports bar in LA. Definitely a consistent place to go. What I mean is like others chains  you know what you're getting all around:Service: ok/not badWait for table: can take a while  but now you can call ahead (and this place is bigger than other BJs)Atmosphere: Fun/can get rowdy (aka you can get drunk and no one will notice)Clientele: at this location I was expecting yuppies  but it was a very diverse crowd in age and ethnicity (plus); also mall rats (downside)Food: pretty good - much better than bar food - pizza is a yesDrinks: love the berry burst cider and overall good selection of brewsBJs can be a fun place but beware is you are uptight. It is not for the sheepish.
Henan J.,Los Angeles  CA,377,406,1169,5/25/2010,3.0,Cool spot  nothing specifically different from the other locations though.The server seemed to be pre-occupied and peeved...i cant say it was because of our table.Hostess was helpful in finding the right accommodations  TV screens were all on the right NBA game and the crowd was vibrant.Had the Long Island  Shot of Something and The Crispy Calamari. (the drinks and food were GOOD)
Robert B.,San Rafael  CA,4,11,,1/24/2010,1.0,"After weeks of hearing how excited my coworkers were that BJ\'s was opening up just minutes from work  I thought I had to check it out. First mistake - believing any of the hype - it\'s not THAT great  and while they have a respectable beer selection  it\'s not something that sets them apart. The service was terrible. We had three different waiters (I\'m assuming the first two quit because they knew how badly they were doing) and the manager serve us. All of them managed to forget to bring one person\'s food. In fact  they forgot to place her order all together. We were a group of 5  so it\'s not like it was huge party. Then when the food came out  they lied  and said  ""oh  it\'ll be right out."" Without verifying the order  they didn\'t know what ""it"" was. Those of us who got our food were not impressed. It wasn\'t particularly hot  exploding with flavor  or even what I\'d call ""good food.""The small sized pizza was more like a small sized pizza crust  with an extra small portion of pizza toppings. Think giant breadstick  dipped in cheese and sauce.  The beer I requested  a seasonal pumpkin beer  tasted nothing like pumpkin  and barely like beer. It was weak in the flavor department  though thankfully not flat. Waiting an hour and a half (and reminding them about it 3 times) only made it that much more frustrating. We ended up getting the ""forgotten"" meal to go  had to ask twice for the bill  and even had to request our cards back after paying. While the rest of the experience definitely overshadowed any other gripes  the floor was not particularly clean  the tables were certainly not clean  and the atmosphere was more like that of a pub at happy hour - crowded  noisy  and a little smelly. Unfortunately  there\'s no 1/2 star rating I can give this place  because that\'s a little more fitting. They DO have food  and they DO have beer  so I suppose 0 stars would be out of the question."
Shane H.,Los Angeles  CA,64,42,13,12/11/2009,1.0,"Fail. First couple times we went during lunch close to when they just opened. Both times were reasonable with standard service. Their Lunch Special is priced pretty good for what you get.... but this B.J.\'s branch in particular has horrendous service.The food has been pretty decent for a chain restaurant and tastes as expected.The last two times me and my co-worker have been here has been the most terrible service I have ever seen at a restaurant. We are talking nearly 3 hour lunches. Who has time for this?First time  they claimed the computer had a glitch and our food orders never got put in.They tried to compensate us with some Mozerella Sticks after we had been patient for over an hour. I told them that is unacceptable service and we left with a 30 dollar gift card  plus our meals being taken care of  to-go. We felt it was the right thing to do and left with the agreement to give this location another shot.Second time  we decided to use our gift card. In summary  drink order took 40 minutes  food took an hour. Overall lunch  about 2 hours. The waiter tried to blame it on the bartender. Again  the service and wait time is unacceptable by any means.I work nearby and I don\'t have 3 hours to eat at a restaurant  nor do I think reasonable person does. Their food is simply ""okay"" and far from being worth the time it takes for them to do anything. You won\'t see me... or any of my coworker visit this location ever again. To the manager Liz: Thanks for the effort in getting us to come back a second time. We now regret ever setting foot in the restaurant and your efforts have completely gone in vain.Nice try."
Evan G.,New York  NY,220,729,355,4/18/2010,2.0,I know it's a brewhouse  but the first six pages of the menu are drinks.Six pages.This is not a family album  folks. It's a restaurant. The beers are great  though. The food is OK. The staff wasn't really interested in getting our orders right or getting things to the table in the right order or at the same time. Entrees for four of us arrived in three trips a grand total of five minutes apart. And when the last to arrive is a salad  there's something wrong happening in the kitchen/expediter area.Not a fan.
Bob B.,Manhattan Beach  CA,101,23,1,2/25/2010,3.0,Beer selection and food here is great. What prevents this from being more than 3 starts is the service. While the staff is friendly  the service is slow and so is the wait for everything here. This place is crowded from open-close it seems. Not a place for big groups yet  maybe after they have been oprn for a year or after xmas 2010. Tip-sit in the bar area. no required wait list
Eileen R.,Los Angeles  CA,55,15,1,4/22/2010,4.0,This is a great spot to meet up with friends either for a bday  a social gathering  happy hour or to celebrate a graduation  a family outing...it's sort of a 'one size fits all'. The food is pretty good with pretty large portions and the prices are decent. Being an avocado lover  I usually order the avocado rolls. I just visited over the weekend and tried the Platinum Margarita. It looks like a martini  and it is more than delicious. I ordered two. The service is really good and the restaurant is clean. Great atmosphere. Since it's next to the newly renovated Westfield Plaza  (to those of us who have been around long enough  it will forever be FOX HILLS MALL!) you can always go shopping after you eat  and walk your food off.
Hanh S.,Los Angeles  CA,8,55,5,5/18/2011,1.0,Had to go here for a dinner meeting. Pretty terrible customer service compared to any BJ's I've been to. Server was incompetent and rude. Ended up getting my food to go.Oh and a fire broke lose behind our table and a manager did not come to apologize.
K S.,Los Angeles  CA,16,7,,1/5/2013,2.0,Double-check your take-out order.One of my items was completely missing despite the woman going over the order item by item. I realize I should have checked myself  but you would think that if she is checking stuff off that she is actually paying attention. This is not the only location I have experienced this with so it makes me think that BJ's needs to find a better way to ensure that they are putting together the orders acurately 
Megan S.,Atwater Village  Los Angeles  CA,348,304,59,2/24/2010,4.0,Here's a good tip for the next time you go. When you think BJs  think BAR JOINT. The main area crowds really easily because of the restaurant's extremely visible location  but if you have a party of no more than four or five people  have one person scout out the bar tables...you'll probably get lucky.If you have never been to a BJs  TVs are everywhere. They've got to get some kind of discount from Best Buy for these babies  because they are everywhere you look and showing all different sports. I highly recommend this place for watching football  basketball  baseball  and I can imagine it would be great to watch the Olympics at right now.The bf and I found a table at the bar (luckily) during a late afternoon rush of shoppers waiting at the entrance. We were served very quickly and our waiter was more than attentive even though they were packed. Starving  we ordered the artichoke dip  field of greens salad and BJs favorite pizza. Way  way too much food for two people. Artichoke dip was good  but the chips were a little stale for my liking. Field of Greens salad was great  and BJs favorite pizza was delicious  deep dish with tons of great flavors and a good topping distribution.I know this place is a chain  but they do things well here  at least in the bar area. You get a wide range of people here  from the shoppers  to the all girl parties  to families  to couples. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves when I went  but maybe that's because my eyes had glazed over from the food coma.Parking isn't bad  don't valet - there's no reason to  unless your leg is broken or you are on crutches. Parking is free if you park it yourself. This is the perfect low-key end to a morning or afternoon of shopping at the new Fox Hills Mall  which has been beautifully redone.Not a date spot with a girl who doesn't like sports or real-people portions  good for a solid experience with friends or family.Again - remember  bar joint. Sit in the bar area if you can. Avoid the wait.
Stacey N.,Los Angeles  CA,22,25,,10/13/2009,3.0,Living on the border of Playa del Rey  Culver City  Westchester  and Marina del Rey surprisingly leaves little options for pizza  beer and watching sports. This is probably why when I arrived to BJ's Brewhouse on a Monday night for some football  beer and pizza there was over an hour wait. Knowing that getting back in the car would only lead to driving around for an hour without being able to think of another place to do this (besides maybe Tony Ps in Marina del Rey) I stuck it out. This new BJs is located in the new (renovated) Culver City Westfield mall and I think everyone is excited as I am to add a chain restaurant to a very barren area. So the real reason for coming here was their claim for a Chicago style deep dish pizza. I kind of laughed before even arriving because I am from Chicago and have never heard of a BJs before. I ordered the BJs favorite which consisted of meatballs  pepperoni  italian sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and seasoned tomatoes. I ordered it minus black olives because black olives on pizza is repulsive. I guess it was wrong to assume that although sauce isn't listed  it would still be there. It was not. I also could not distinguish the meatballs from the sausage. The biggest issue is that this was not Chicago style deep dish... nor a deep dish pizza at all. This is called pan pizza and in my experience isn't even close. I know this seems like a negative review  but overall I still enjoyed the pizza. The flavors are good and I had no problem eating half of the pizza in one sitting. But  this is not deep dish and it doesn't even have sauce - so take it for what it is.The best thing about BJs is the beer selection and I thoroughly enjoyed my flight of beers. I also had the BBQ chicken ranch salad which was fabulous. Looking around a lot of the plates coming out of the kitchen looked good so I will come back - someday. If you want to go I would wait until the hype of a new restaurant in town is over  and I wouldn't go on a big sports day  and I probably wouldn't order the pizza.3quests.wordpress.com
Phoebe M.,Hayward  CA,584,68,65,3/8/2010,3.0,*We went on one of the busiest days of the week  Sunday  so please keep that in mind with this review* I I am a fan of BJ's  but this BJ's is not the best in terms of atmosphere. The food is great still. But  the parking is horrible  the location is bigger than others I've gone to so that may be why it took slightly a bit longer for service and food. Nevertheless  our servers did a great job with trying to keep up with our drinks and get our food ordered  etc. We have yet to try going on a weekday but the food is still good (ordered the BJ's favorite)  the pazookie (oreo flavored) is still great  and the fact that it's located in a mall makes it nice to walk all the food off after! Just not on a Sunday when it's busy! =)
Rima T.,Inglewood  CA,582,9,5,6/6/2012,1.0,Two friends and I decided to eat lunch at BJs on day we were having a good conversation waiting on our food then suddenly this dumb ass waiter dropped 3 tall glasses filled with ice and drinks down my back. Then he just walked away never came back never apologized we called for The manager 15 minutes later this idiot came didn't care didn't try to help us so we sat there thinking they will give me a shirt to put on nothing like that happend I literally had to get loud for them to have some sympathy it took them an hour to give me a shirt and comp the food but we still had to pay for our drinks. It took them a whole hour to do something about the situation. A costumer that was there came over to us and told us she saw the whole thing and we wasn't being treated right she even made a complaint. It was crazy the worst restaurant i have been to by far.
Kamika K.,Long Beach  CA,17,43,7,6/5/2011,1.0,Service was terrible! Food was only okay compared to the other BJs I've been too. Management is not responsive nor accommodating. Waitress acted like we were an inconvenience to her. And! Can I just say that when customers are seated it would be best to not immediately ask me what I'd like to drink before my butt even makes contact with the seat. Give me about a minute or two to see what you have. Sheesh!
Karen L.,Culver City  CA,1,23,,3/26/2014,3.0,service here is usually great but tonight it was just ok. the attitude of everyone working (expect the hostess taking names) was irritated and annoyed. giving 3 stars because I usually love it here. tonight was very disappointing.
S S.,Koreatown  Los Angeles  CA,62,30,3,4/6/2012,4.0,I always end up going to BJ's when I can't think where else to go. I have tried a lot of dishes and liked most of them. They do have a good happy hour. My favorites include stuffed mushroom  caprese salad  veggie pizza  Ahi salad  Parmesan crusted chicken and definitely oreo pizookie. Service is ok. Generally the restaurant is always crowded  but servers make sure they take care of you. Prices are reasonable. Parking is easy in the mall.
Scott K.,El Segundo  CA,6,12,,1/22/2011,4.0,Of course when the restaurant is located in the Fox Hills Mall  you are going to attract various types of customers. It seems at BJs of Culver City  the less desirables tend to gather there  as you can see from some of these reviews. I make regular visits to this place  so I feel that I am better prepared to review the restaurant than the one-time visitor or the digruntled DMV employee whos boss just told her that she would only get an hour for lunch today instead of two...This review is strictly taken from the restaurant at night or in the early evening.The restaurant itself is very clean until the late night crowd comes and starts pissing all over the walls in the bathroom and leaving their hand towels strewn across the bathroom floor. You must wade a through a herd of people just to get to the host stand and be put on a wait  its that crowded on a regular basis. The wait seems to vary from a matter of minutes  to up to 45 depending on what time you get there. The host staff is generally pretty solid. There are times when they seem a little tired and unenthusiastic by the end of the night. But then again  you would be a little worn out too dealing with people swarming around you for hours on end.The service itself is generally good. Some servers are better than others  but I guess its the luck of the draw. They usually arrive within a matter of minutes  depending on how busy it is. I myself used to work in the service industry  so I know how it is. Unless many of the customers that I see  I know that I am not the only table the server is taking care of. Some people think that they are the only ones in the entire restaurant  which leads to a server getting behind on the rest of his/her tables. Most people dont seem to understand that. I know that if Im ordering a well done burger  its not going to be ready in 10 minutes. If my server has a armful of plates  its probably not the best time to stick out my glass and ask for some more water. As long as you stick to the menu and dont turn it into a do-it-yourself salad bar  everything usually goes off without a hitch. The food itself is pretty good  depending on what you get. Going there to get a steak and expecting it to be like Arnie Mortons  youre not going to be satisfied. When something on the menu says spicy  its not going to be mild. If you dont like seafood  but the dish has shrimp in it.....what do you expect? Its good old fashioned unhealthy comfort food and beer to have while youre watching the game. You want it in 5 minutes  go to McDonalds. You want fine dining  go to Spago's. You want to drink beers and eat wings  go to BJs.....but if you do  please tip your servers. They deal with more than you could ever imagine.....And being a former server myself  I can only imagine what they deal with at BJs in Culver City.
Cindee G.,Los Angeles  CA,14,57,38,6/23/2011,5.0,I love BJs! I am a fan of their lunch specials  and of their mojitos they are delicious and straight to the point! haha
Joeanna J.,Los Angeles  CA,1,18,,4/29/2011,1.0,If I could go below one star i would!!! I went here for my birthday and I was VERY disappointed with their food and service! Some of the people in my party arrived pretty late and the waiters hounded me about the extra chairs when they had more than plenty of other chairs available! Before I left I decided to complain and NOT a shocker when the manager made excuses for her rude ass employees! Never going to WASTE my money here again!
Marcello B.,Inglewood  CA,3,5,,10/19/2013,2.0,Food and service was good  but there was plenty of left over residue on the eating utensils and the wait was long even though we had reservations.
Victor P.,El Segundo  Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,10/22/2012,3.0,Over all a good place to eat. We went to watch the football game but not really sports bar feeling to mellow and more like chilled place to relax and eat. But I would recommend the place
AJ K.,Alhambra  CA,205,247,18,3/4/2012,1.0,Extremely Poor service and undercooked pizza  it's sad because my girlfriend loves BJ's. We sent it back and got the exact same result the second time. It took over 15 minutes to flag down our waitress again (even after we asked another waitress to send her over both times) to try and fix it  so I just put cash on the table for my beer and we just left. The really sad part was the beer was even a little skunky  but hell what can you do when you can't even find your waitress for the food.
N A.,Marina del Rey  CA,2,4,,1/17/2014,5.0,I love their spinach and artichoke pizza. I always order from there when I am craving deep dish pizza. The Best Beginnings appetizer combo is a great option for three or more people. The ambiance is ok  nothing special- I haven't eaten in a lot but we used to get takeout from there often when I lived in Playa Vista. So good!
Kay S.,Colorado Springs  CO,17,58,4,2/26/2010,3.0,I like the food at BJ's. I like the pizzas and especially the meatloaf dinner. I love the beers and the beer sampler thing they have. BUT....This location's parking is absolutely horrible and it's obnoxious to get valet parking. I will say that the service was pretty good though which is different than my experiences at other locations.
Roger C.,Inglewood  CA,19,24,1,1/3/2012,4.0,Great mini pizza! Happy hour half off mini pizza..
Dr E.,Los Angeles  CA,16,12,3,6/14/2011,2.0,So  I brought my cousins to have dinner since we hadn't seen one another in a while. We came relatively late in the night and what a mistake that was. Our waiter wasn't the most helpful  but he tried. The waiter a few tables down from us kept muttering under his breath and cursing out his customers. The waiter behind us said he was going to shove something up someone's ass and it wouldn't be his pen. What kind of service is this? The professionalism went out the door tonight. I'm really disappointed in the service provided tonight.
Shannon R.,Los Angeles  CA,284,109,2,1/19/2010,4.0,"OK atmosphere and great place to watch ""the games"". I like how the waiter worked with us on splitting up the checks and the pizza is FANTASTIC. Plenty of parking.Becareful  it\'s a popular place so waiting for a table may take some time. It seems like people come here to pickup dates too  so don\'t be surprised if you get approached by some cheesy person with a corny pick-up line."
B J.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,5/22/2011,3.0,Food was just ok. And the server was terrible. The atmosphere was nice! Plenty of TVs for the sport lovers! Maybe i ordered the wrong thing. I just ordered a burger and figured i would be safe. I was not impressed.
Olivia R.,Newport Beach  CA,80,7,77,3/23/2012,1.0,It was my first time at BJs and it was not a good experience. 1. Our waitress never brought us water2. It took way too long to get our beer and wine3. The salad I ordered was the saddest looking salad I had ever seen. It was soggy with no flavor and it had some tomatoes thrown on it and a little bit of artichoke. They make the salad sound so wonderful on the menu and it was crap. I make better salads at home! For it being a 10 dollar salad I expected more then just some veggies thrown on a late.my plate wasn't even full. It was poor presentation and the quality was terrible. It looked like a very sad side salad. Plus it was missing some ingredients which were listed on the menu. It looked like whoever made the salad didn't care one bit. I think while they cooked my boyfriends burger they threw together my salad in 2 min and let it soak in the dressing for a good 45 minutes. I don't ever complain like this or write a review but that experience was terrible especially because I was so hungry and had waited so long for our food. It had no taste..and I sure as hell didn't want to eat soggy lettuce...so I went to subway after. Now that was good! The waitress told me I wasn't the first to complain about the garden medley salad..so NO I'm not crazy  lolMy boyfriend ordered a burger which he thought wasn't bad but not the best burger hes had. IF your going to mess up a burger there's something really wrong. The wait on everything was ridiculous. I don't think wed go there again but I did like their selection of beers. If anything wed go back for drinks.Also  after I returned my salad I wanted to glance at the menu again in case something else sounded good but then i realized I would of had to wait prob another 40 min to eat...no thank you. She never brought me a menu anyway. I had to get up and get it myself. It was nice of the manager to come over and talk to me about it because someone in the kitchen isn't doing their job back there. I wouldn't want anyone to get their food they way I did.
Krystle B.,New Orleans  LA,100,196,62,11/29/2011,4.0,The server was a little weird and acted like she was trying really hard not be be mean to us even though we just sat down. Other than that  I like the restaurant. The food is really good and there is plenty to choose from. Also  its clean and has a nice atmosphere.
Crystal C.,West Covina  CA,1,20,,3/19/2011,1.0,I love BJ's but this one is horrible. The service was horrible and the food was worse. I thought maybe it was the day I went so I tried it a second time and it wasnt my imagination. DO NOT go to this BJ's. This is a bad one.
Carol T.,Culver City  CA,1,11,18,10/5/2011,4.0,good amercian sized food! awesome attentive service !yes i would come back as it is neighboorhood restaurant.huge portions!
Jamie M.,Los Angeles  CA,8,18,,2/12/2011,2.0,we where there last night and it was crazy our server was too confused and it takes long time to get our order and showed up with wrong check
T M.,Santa Barbara  CA,2,3,,5/10/2014,3.0,Good Food. Enjoyed the in-house beer that they produce. Staff was friendly and made me feel very welcome.
Michael K.,Los Angeles  CA,27,15,2,2/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Turns out after I left with my daughter in a separate car that the manager came over and apologized to my wife and son and gave them a free dessert. For that gesture I am upping my rating to two stars. By the way the floors are slippery! I thought someone had spilled something!
dominique m.,Los Angeles  CA,79,257,100,11/12/2011,5.0,Great restaurant service was a little slow but the food was hott and very good.. i love the cajun shrimp pasta!! great place to go and hangout w. friends or family meals
Wendy C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,7,2,4/11/2014,5.0,The deep dish pizza here is great! Love all the proprietary & craft beers on tap. The service is exceptional! a very well trained staff. Great place to watch a game in a good  comfortable & friendly atmosphere!
Kennya W.,Compton  CA,82,106,3,10/16/2011,4.0,Been here twice already. First time  the server sucked. My friend made a big ordeal about his service. She got a free dessert. Came here on thursday and we had the lunch special. My lunch was great and so was our waiter. I think I might be addicted to their ceasar salad because I cannot get enough. I've been thinking about it everyday now. Good place to watch sports as well  if you are into it.
T T.,Los Angeles  CA,3,34,1,8/5/2010,1.0,Worst Service ever!!The one star is because there is not a zero star option! I and three co-workers went to this BJ's last night for a work meeting and we received the worst possible service ever! Our waiter Carl was the absolute worst. Slow  forgetful  and he did like 17 disappearing acts in our 2 hour time frame that we were there. The best part was he actually disappeared the last time for aver 35 minutes and when I finally decided to ask for service another waiter came to us and told us Carl had gone home! Great! Thanks for the heads up Mr. Carl. Food was great ONCE we got it but again food is great at any BJ's.At this restaurant your name almost has to be Tyrone or Lequisha for you to be able to even get service. Absolute worst service and will never return.
Maggie Z.,Los Angeles  CA,38,265,14,10/25/2009,3.0,"I\'m kind of wishy washy about BJ\'s. It\'s a chain but it\'s better than most chains. When I haven\'t been in a while  I think  ""Ooh  BJ\'s."" But then when I get there  the service is kind of crappy and the food is just OK.You\'ve got to love the pizzookie though."
Oliver Q.,Thousand Oaks  CA,0,5,,7/27/2012,3.0,Great food every single time. Just don't expect good service. The servers are all over the place  I dont think they work as a team per se. Just know going in youre going to receive shitty service and maybe be surprised.
Jocelyn M.,Inglewood  CA,53,430,238,7/21/2011,4.0,happy hour  half off mini pizzas!!! whooohooooo!!as far as regular hours go  i am not always keen on paying restaurant prices for pizza i can get at half the price  AKA happy hour  LOLdrinks at chains tend to be watered down  so i normally get mine straight!its by fox hills  so prepare for the possible attitude and u will be fine. =D
Chuck P.,Culver City  CA,203,32,,2/22/2012,3.0,I like it here - its close to home - next to Gold's to remind me to not go crazy eating and the food is OK - tonight we randomly ended up here - its not overly crowded but WOW is the service S L O W...come here when you are in no hurry
T. M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,91,,12/27/2009,2.0,Do not call ahead of time  it does nothing and you have to wait forever just to get a table. You would think that if you called for a reservation that you would be seated promptly? Nope  don't count on it. I was soo hungry and ready to go into the mall just to eat. While we were eating our food  we heard multiple customers complain to servers asking to speak to managers. They need better management maybe? The best location is on Maui. You can't even tell it's a part of this crappy chain. They have better menu options and their pizza tastes wayyy better.
Kalin M.,Los Angeles  CA,215,100,22,3/6/2011,2.0,I will never understand why people like this place..I only gave it two stars because of the pizookie. Every item I've ever had tasted extremely bland! The people that eat here are obnoxious each times I've been here. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone  and I'd never come here unless someone got down on their knees and begged me to.
Alice K.,Los Angeles  CA,549,392,93,9/15/2010,1.0,EEWWWWW!The first time I came here was when they first opened  which was great cause I never been to a BJ's and the hype of the Pizzookie was what I was suppose to order  which was great. The service was great  since these new waiters were training and everyone was pleasant and happy they got the job.but last night  as soon as I walked in  I felt the place was just dirty. I know it was late and it was packed because of Monday Night Football  but it just smelled bad. I ordered a berry type martini  which tasted like simple syrup and when you get a martini  it usually looks and taste chilled  this just looked like corn syrup in a glass. My clam chowder was way too salty and they even said they would charge me for sour dough bread  since I got it in a cup and not in the bowl. Whatever.... I think I can afford 2 pieces of bread. I ordered the flat bread pizza. BLAHHH!! took one bite and said  I'll take it to go. Assuming I would eat it when I was starving at work and have nothing else to eat. The only good part of this place was our waiter.Very friendly  funny and just had a great sense of humor. He did ask if we wanted dessert. I wasn't going to risk another bad dish.
Jillian R.,Brentwood  Los Angeles  CA,40,244,5,2/21/2011,2.0,The service here was not good for a large group (15). We had a reservation for 8:00 & they sat us at 8:45  but then gave 2 complimentary appetizer platters  which was appreciated. Drink refills were hard to come by and the food came out sporadically. Worst of all  the floor is SO slippery throughout the entire restaurant. Why? I have no idea  but was told that's how it always is--I saw 2 people fall. As far as food  it's your standard BJs fare.
Abbi F.,Los Angeles  CA,376,210,,7/29/2011,2.0,The food is generally good for a chain as all things go. This particular BJ's is ALWAYS packed at any time of any day that you would want to go to a BJ's to eat/drink. On the up side  the wait staff has always been super nice & attentive. On the down side  I've had to wait rather an appallingly long time for food on two separate occasions as well as had soup brought to the table cold (which was then returned  followed by a new bowl brought out that was only lukewarm).
Jeff P.,Phoenix  AZ,60,897,17,4/29/2011,4.0,Always love the huge beer selection. Great food too. Plenty of tvs for any game.
Mike L.,Redondo Beach  CA,0,1,,2/28/2010,1.0,Location  location  location  but not this one. Overall  my family likes BJ's  but this was the first time and last we will ever visit this location  and give us pause in consideration of others in the future. The service was the worst I have ever received at a restaurant. We arrived at about noon on Sunday and the restaurant was fairly empty and we sat down quickly. And sat we did. We were given kids menu  but no crayons for two year old; petty stuff but could tell where things were going. Drinks came out relatively quick  but the appetizer took longer than expected and we weren't offered plates in the process.Over the course of the next hour we saw waitress once when she said we go check on food  but then didn't return for 15 minutes only to tell us something was messed up  it was being worked on and that the manger would be out. Well  in the next bit my daughter was falling asleep  the food still hadn't arrived nor did the manager ever make an appearance. Finally  we decided to take the food to go and I took my daughter to car. It was another 15 minutes before the food was ready and my wife could leave the restaurant. And in that time the manager never made an appearance. I'd assume not everyone receives the same experience  but after all the wait  not to at least have the manage make an appearance and offer some form of apology is untenable.
London W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,3/26/2013,1.0,This place is so shitty it took 30 minutes to get barbecue sauce the service is horrible and the servers are very rude don't every come here I would dear spend another penny at this place
Tracie P.,Los Angeles  CA,22,27,,7/11/2011,4.0,Lunch @ BJ's on Friday  July 8th  2011 inside the Fox Hills Mall. It was my first time stepping foot inside a BJ's restaurant and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. The crowd was lively and our waiter was attentive and friendly. We had the most amazing appetizer - crispy wontons wrap and for my entre  I enjoyed the mini mediterranean pizza. YUM!
Lailanie G.,Los Angeles  CA,319,5,1,8/6/2011,5.0,I love BJs! This is my favorite BJs that I like to frequent. Great service  great food  and great for groups. Wait can be long when it's busy. Always have had great times here especially during game days.
Jason S.,Culver City  CA,71,10,,2/20/2011,2.0,The food is good  but the service and staff are not. Very slow and bad timing despite the large number of people they have working at a given time. Sitting at the bar is a better experience if you're not looking for a sit down dinner/table. The curbside take out is a good option too if you live close by as it will avoid the experience of the servers.
michael r.,Tarzana  CA,65,118,,5/23/2011,4.0,Solid food  good bar  always consistent. Love the pizza and the sandwiches  and the beer is wonderful. Always busy  but I've always found it's worth the wait.
Crystal E.,Crenshaw  Los Angeles  CA,44,18,2,5/18/2013,1.0,If it were possible to give this negative stars I would do it in a heartbeat. This was only my 2nd time going to the BJ's in Culver City and my LAST. 1. We tried to call to make a reservation -they tell us oh we aren't taking reservations until 9:45pm (it was 8:12pm) we get there and because we had a large party they ask us did we call ahead. Umm we tried to and you told us we couldn't do that.2. So we talk to the manager because we were told it would be a 45 minute wait and it was an hour and a half. Sooo the managers response was I can get you all some appetizers to eat in the lobby. WTF??!! Then she says well maybe I can get some crackers! WTF HA! I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. It was a friends college graduation night that is the only reason we stayed. But unfortunately it a ruined night because of BJ's! But we laughed loud and hard at the absolute foolishness!
Thomas F.,Santa Monica  CA,3,65,2,10/16/2009,3.0,It is not my kind of place. I won't come back unless Tricia Helfer invites me. Actually  there were a lot of cuties in the place at lunch time.My friends enjoyed the place a lot. They loved the burger  pasta  pizza menu. Everyone loved sharing large pizzas and pitchers of beer  while looking at a Dodger game on flat screen. The desert of ice cream on cookies brought out special excitement.
Kunal R.,Culver City  Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,10/11/2013,2.0,Good place to eat if you have patience to wait for your order. Took us almost 2 hours to finish our dinner.
Natalie S.,Los Angeles  CA,30,73,142,6/16/2011,5.0,went there for there happy hour and the service was great.Including the food and seating at the bar with booth and tables. The drinks are so good will go back again :)
wendy j.,Playa del Rey  CA,49,43,34,5/29/2010,2.0,You can watch 4 innings of the Dodgers game without being interupted with your food. We ordered a sandwich and kids corn dogs they took over 40 minutes and the dogs and side mashed potatoes were cold. Plus I was charged twice. It takes 10 minutes to be sat at an empty restaurant I'd hate to go there when they are busy.
Patrick T.,Manhattan Beach  CA,35,21,,10/1/2012,1.0,Arguably the worst dining experience from a service perspective I have experienced. The wait staff was late to the table  they were inattentive to just about everything - we had to constantly call someone over to refill drinks; we even had to flag down a bus boy to clear our table  as the dirty dishes were left in front of us for over 15 minutes after we were done. When they delivered a happy birthday sundae they actually put it down on the dirty dish of the recipient. To top it all off  the bathrooms were a complete mess and had no toilet paper. I could see this for a lower class of restaurant  but when you are shelling out this kind of money for a meal  you expect attentive service and clean restrooms. BJs - your food is good  why are you screwing it all up with lousy service? Train your staff and get someone in the bathrooms to inspect them!!
Kay G.,Los Angeles  CA,36,248,48,2/1/2011,4.0,Usually all of the meals are decent... except for the beer battered fish. Absolutely flavorless and dissatisfying. Pizzas are good  burgers are decent. The lunch menu is delicious  especially the teriyaki salmon. Only get the pizookie if you plan on sharing it. I can get through Chili's molten lava cake but not a pizookie. Haven't exactly had bad service  just slightly ditzy attendants with the to-go department. Over the phone they never get the order correct. Call in ahead to reserve a table  especially on the weekends. We did once and instead of waiting 30 minutes  we waited less than three.
Iman Taliah H.,Oakland  CA,38,64,15,3/12/2011,4.0,This place was great all the way around! Nice atmosphere  quick  friendly staff  and great food! I had the shrimp tacos which were quite delectable. Overall it was a great outing. Our only issue was finding parking.
Fernando A.,Culver City  CA,8,1,,6/5/2010,1.0,Dinning in is great but take out is a mess. It's too loud and when you go in to pick up your food you just want to run......
Poison I.,La Puente  CA,10,39,7,5/17/2011,3.0,The lettuce wraps not the best skip it .....friendly staff nice place not my cup of tea but dont mind going
Nahum O.,Los Angeles  CA,2,6,8,6/27/2011,3.0,The day I went here was very mellow  there were about ten people in the place. Anyway  the food was really good. I had a turkey club and my girlfriend had a BBQ string pork sandwich. The proportions are really generous. The fries are bomb! And the pazooki was really good. The service was excellent. I was shocked at how cheaply priced the food was. I'll be here in the future.
Bennett Y.,Los Angeles  CA,13,15,3,9/3/2010,1.0,It was a big mistake to wait for 45 minutes to be seated at this place. And as soon as we got our tables  the waiter said that we will have another waiter to take our orders  that took another 30 Minutes to wait. After he took the orders  we waited for another 20 minutes to check our food so he finally decided to give us bread and butter because it will take more time to bring the order. The appetizers finally came  but the main course was served after another 30 mins to wait. At this time  our waiter left for the evening  and the other waiter took over to finish serving us. We were 7  and 6 ordered steaks  fish  etc.  but the crazy thing was  the person that ordered the salad was the last one to get her food. It was very disappointing. After the fact that we spent almost close to $200.00 for lousy service and not so good meal. We will never recommend this place.
James W.,West Adams  Los Angeles  CA,135,41,10,6/18/2013,2.0,BJ's Culver City is usually our go-to spot for a guaranteed good meal. I usually get the Hawaiian mahi mahi and the other person in the party gets traditional buffalo wings and we order a half and half pazookie. The hostesses are always amazing as they were last night and they remember our faces and know how much we frequent this restaurant and usually sit in a booth in the bar. Last night we decided to go there after a pretty long hiatus and we say ourselves in a booth after a great enjoyable welcoming conversation with the hostesses around 8:45pm. We sat there in the both for about 7 minutes until our server came over. We even tried to flag down someone who we saw just standing leaning back against the wall by the stairs that lead up to the restrooms  he looked at us then looked away. Finally our server Travis came over. He brought us menus and said he'll be right back. We were like ok...after about 4-5 minutes he returned with waters and asked did we want anything else to drink or an appetizer and we said no thank u we're ready to order. So we ordered the traditional wings and Hawaiian mahi mahi. He left to quickly before I could ask for one more thing. Now we hadn't seen him even walk by to check on us until our food came when I wanted to ask him for limes for our waters. Our food was delicious as always which was one of the highlights of the evening. Then we ordered a pazookie at 9:06pm and at 9:11 Travis came by saying it'll be out in just a few minutes and we were like ok great thank u. 9:26 rolls around and he finally brings it over to us and we were close to canceling it because of how long it took. He said that the kitchen burned the first one which is what took so long...didn't really believe that and would've expected something a little more than a half-a**ed apology. The manager could have at least brought it out since Travis was very slow and we barely saw him anyways. When he brought the pazookie we immediately asked for the bill because if we didn't we knew it would be another 20 minutes before we saw him again. The crazy/funny/ironic part is that once I put the cash down for the bill he came immediately right back. That was the quickest we had seen him return and it was when it involved money. Tsk tsk tsk Tavis!! That's not a good way to receive a substantial gratuity. As we left the hostess continued be a highlight of our dining experience. The server was not an experience we're used to receiving and enjoying while there at BJ's Culver City.
Linda C.,San Jose  CA,9,17,10,2/25/2013,1.0,"I\'m sure We made opinions of the place very clear when we left the place but for good measure...Food: 3-1/2 starsService: 0 starsmanagement: -5 starsDidn\'t get upset when the server took all of 10 minutes to come take our drink orders or when she took another 20 minutes to bring them out because she was being chatty with another table. Was a bit upset when we realized a drink got mixed up but mostly in panic. One of the girls in group is allergic to strawberries got served strawberry lemonade rather than pink lemonade. I told her that I needed to get Benadryl for the girl. I only started getting angry when I had to stand there watching the server taking her sweet time going back to the manager\'s office.Management: 0. Took another 10 billion yrs getting himself out to the dining area n Rather than helping us find a solution  like call an ambulance.. Or tell me where the drug store is.. Instead he tells us: ""we can\'t give you medicine."" I ran over that mall looking for Benadryl.Oh to fan my fury...!!!!!The manager...after the emergency is handled  by others and not himself  tries smooth things out by speaking to us in Korean once he realized we were Korean as well. Really!?????To that food server: in case ur mgr didn\'t tell u  u don\'t take ur sweet ol time getting ur boss. Don\'t cause alarm to other customers but when u walk  u walk as fast as u can to grab ur mgr when someone tells u a customer of urs is allergic to something u served. The mgr. Ur answers needed to start with ""we can...I can..."" and then add ""but cannot..."""
Hugo S.,Inglewood  CA,157,257,77,2/25/2011,3.0,The food is always good. BJ's always has soooo much to choose from. Pazookie  the best ever.. Good hang out spot with friends.
Michael L.,Los Angeles  CA,27,8,,7/24/2011,3.0,Food was quick and pretty tasty and the service was also acceptable however the microbrew I just love ! Go for a beer and calzone!
Ed B.,Redondo Beach  CA,1,38,2,9/18/2011,2.0,OMG BJ's owners. Help. We were there for the opening and the service was so disorganized we all laughed about it. We went back figuring it was just because it was new. I waited and went back months later and it was the same thing. I have no idea what you are trying to do here with the way you divide responsibilities. Whatever it is  change it. People are really nice but the order is ALWAYS messed up. On the bright side  it has become a bit of a comedic relief. It's also walking distance from our business  which is a very large corporation with lot's of people. Lucille's will probably put you out of business if you don't adapt. Thankfully you have good value (food for the price that is)
Erika T.,Torrance  CA,0,1,,8/26/2012,1.0,We are a fan of Bjs.....but this is the worst experience ever. THe service is bad  the food is bad and cold. Yuck! The waiters are horrible. First and last time we set foot at this Bjs. Never again. Nothing compared to Bjs cerritos or Torrance.
Kenghis K.,Van Nuys  CA,1,42,,8/7/2010,1.0,Over priced  small portions  and when I asked what the brewery special was the waitress just pointed at the card on the table. Also given the parking problem it just is not worth your time or money.
G A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,61,30,6/25/2010,2.0,This place has been a total train wreck since it opened. I hoped that service would become more organized after a few months....no such luck. So sad to say  as I live right across the street from Westfields Culver City and I've always known BJs as a decent spot for a burger and a beer. Every single time I have gone to this location  we have had issues. The last time was the final straw. Took some friends to BJs for a late 3pm lunch. When we sat down  it took a good 20 minutes to have our drink order taken and the restaurant was not even 25% full. The waitress was M.I.A while we were waiting  and waiting  and waiting for our food. 45 minutes later  our food came out...mostly. One of my friends ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque. All she got was the sandwich. We waited 5-10 minutes for the waitress to emerge from wherever she was to ask for the soup. 10 mins  20 mins  30 mins pass! We have all finished our food and the grilled cheese is now a cold cheese sandwich. The waitress would walk by every once in a while to mumble that the soup wasn't ready yet...finally  we flagged the manager to find out what the deal was. The manager was nice and said he would have a replacement for the whole order out in a few minutes and would comp my friend's meal. Thanks  but it was all a little too late. The majority of our lunch was spent complaining about the service and wondering how it could take so long to make tomato soup. The place is always packed in the evening  especially on big sport nights...so I know this place has gotta be doing well financially. Perhaps this is why there is no incentive for them to improve on their service? Sucks for me  I guess.
D H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,30,,6/4/2013,1.0,It was pathetic. The service was slow  the food was cold and the help was  well  not helpful. I will not return  as this was the second time we had a bad experience. We will try the one in the South Bay if we feel masochistic again.
Eboni V.,Tempe  AZ,1,12,7,7/15/2011,3.0,"Hangin out with friends at the Fox Hills Mall prompted us for a bite to eat and a cocktail. BJ\'s was convenient. The hostess was not very friendly (no greeting) but she was not rude either  kind of like a ""whatever"" attitude. However  our server was nice and the ambiance was upbeat! The food was pretty good  I enjoyed the Fried Artichokes and my cocktail was delish :). My friends enjoyed their food ordered some to go."
Shannon M.,Los Angeles  CA,152,36,,12/2/2010,4.0,They have an entire menu dedicated to jumbo baked potatoes....doesn't get better than that yummm!!!! Good beers on tap and fun seasonal options. I'll be back!
Bl T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,9/23/2014,1.0,We have always loved BJ's. The kids regard meals there a huge treat.  One of us is there several times a month. So we were happy to arrange a special celebration at BJ's for our father's 90th birthday  inviting 40+ family members for dinner. It was sort of a Reunion since many of us hadn't seen each other for years.  HUGE mistake. Somehow our dinner consisted of unsauced pasta with a few slices of chicken on top  wilted Caesar Salad  and melted Pazookies. That's it. The bill was nearly $800! The Artichoke Dip was never served. What got me was the pasta with no sauce or seasoning. None. Nada. Zilch. They boiled some pasta and threw it on a platter with NOTHING ON IT. $800. The salad wasn't particularly fresh or well-dressed. We were so embarrassed. I have been apologizing to relatives for 3 weeks now. I have no explanation for what was wrong there. EIGHT HUNDRE3D DOLLARS. The food should have at least been edible. It should have included some proteins. There wasn't even fake cheese sauce! It was garbage. If you go to BJ's  go for a small dinner.  2-4 people so you can control the dishes served. Do not go there for an event of any type. They do not respect their customers. At all. I must end this so I can go apologize to some more relatives...
Vincent A.,Culver City  CA,56,29,,7/1/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Ok I went back. Much better all around; service  food  everything. My only complaint is the value. Came out to $85 for two of us  though we did get a pitcher and dessert. Will probably be back.
D S.,Berkeley  CA,0,15,,6/11/2013,2.0,I've been to this BJ's a few times and really enjoyed their food. Their fettucine alfredo is one of the best I've ever tasted. The problem is about half the time I go there  there's an issue with the staff.  When I went for lunch I didn't seem to have a problem  but for whatever reason the rude waiters and hostesses seem to come out at night.One particular time I went to BJ's with a large group. When the bill came we all divided it up and paid with either cash or credit. A few minutes later the waitress returned with our money and a new bill saying this was a little awkward but we haven't given her enough of a tip. For groups of eight of more they have a specified tip. We were short less than a dollar. The thing is I looked at the new bill and it was completely different from the old one. The old bill had been a general bill  but the new one was for groups. This one actually had a specified tip on it for groups of eight or more  and the initial one did not. It wasn't a big deal adding in the extra change  but several of us paid with credit cards and had written the amounts on the back of the old bill. When we explained this to the waitress and asked for the old bill back  she claimed to have lost it. As a result we had to waste more time figuring out how much everyone was paying again. It was pretty obvious by the end of the ordeal that the waitress had initially given us the general bill hoping we would give her a larger tip than the one mandated by the restaurant for groups of eight or more  and then traded it out for a new bill when the plan backfired. If she had simply made a mistake she could have just told us there was a mix-up  but the shady behavior made it clear that was not the case. Honesty is an important quality I expect from those I give money to  and I did not get it here.In short  the food is good  check out the fettucine alfredo  and if you want to go to this location try to go during the day. If you have a desire to go to BJ's at night  I'd suggest trying another location. Also there's not much parking that's very close to the restaurant and you will probably have to park somewhat far and have to walk some.
Jonathan R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,6/6/2013,1.0,My wife and I went at 4pm on a Wednesday. There was nobody in front of us and it took us about 10 minutes to be seated -1 star. We were seated at a table that had leftover food bits still lying on the table and the seat. I requested another cleaning and nobody cleaned. I requested a second time and nobody cleaned. I requested a third time and nobody cleaned. We had chunks of pineapple  cheese and tomatoes on the table and seat. - 2 stars for lack of consideration  cleanliness and requests not met. We waited 20 minutes before we saw our waitress and proceeded to order. We requested water for a drink and we were never given a refill until that waitress' shift ended and her replacement took over for the dinner shift.I ordered a Cesar salad and my wife ordered a steak-lobster combo. We waited another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. My salad came at the same time has her food and my salad was warm  wilted and soggy. Closer to the center of the salad pile were more acceptable  chilled bits of salad. It felt as though my salad was immediately prepared and then proceeded to wait under a lamp for my wife's dish to be prepped. -2 star for lack of service and unacceptable salad.My wife's steak was cooked to order and her lobster tail was just slightly over-done but it was still acceptable. White cheddar mashed potatoes were tasty :DWe will not be going to this particular restaurant ever again.The baby at the table adjacent to us provided us with some entertainment while we waited for service. +1 star.
Patrick M.,San Diego  CA,17,44,,11/9/2009,1.0,Awful service. After waiting for about thirty minutes we still haven't had our names called. Luckily  someone else who didn't feel like waiting gave us his name to use. They called that name  then told us to wait another ten minutes. Finally  we are seated. We sit there like complete fools  for 10-15 minutes. No server or any sign of recognition. It is impossible to get their attention. And on our way to our table the hostess knocked drinks all over a guest. I felt bad for her and the wait staff because it was so crowded  but it was just such a bad experience we left. Just got up and left after waiting almost 45 minutes for a table. BJ's generally has decent food for a chain so I may go back in the early evening on a week night  but other than that I'll never go back to that particular location.
Phil R.,Upland  CA,2,35,21,10/20/2012,2.0,cant complain about the food  service wasent up to bj's normal standards.
Jeremy S.,Sherman Oaks  CA,2,144,,10/3/2011,2.0,"After one dining experience at BJ\'s  I will not be back (to this location at least). I ate here with my family while celebrating somebody\'s birthday. The atmosphere at this location is everything I try to avoid while eating out. Maybe it\'s the location  a restaurant like this in Culver City attracts the unwashed masses who think that BJ\'s is a fancy place to eat. The couple at the table next to us was drunk  and shoved a cell phone in my face  making me take videos of them chugging beer. I\'m not about to refuse a request by a drunk gangster  my life is worth too much. People here also seem to think it\'s ok to let young children run around the restaurant making all the noise they want. Maybe if they were more responsible in general  they wouldn\'t have those kids to begin with.On to the actual service and food:The servers here are somewhat helpful  but a bit slow to get around to all of the tables and keep water refilled. The food  however  takes forever to arrive. After ordering my pizza  I had to wait around 40 minutes until it arrived  even though the server said the wait was 15 minutes. The pizza itself was the only redeeming thing about my experience. The deep dish crust was flaky and soft  and the toppings were liberally applied.The beer  on the other hand  was disgusting. My wife and I shared the 8-beer sampler  with about 6 ounces of eight different BJ\'s custom beers.The ""Lightswitch Lager"" tasted like rodent urine. I work in a genetics lab where we use mice in experiments  and I know what rodent urine smells like. That is the exact taste of this beer. The porter and the stout were flavorless  and the rest were utterly forgettable. The only beer I would maybe try again is the Jeremiah Red. Avoid this location of BJ\'s in Culver City at all costs! (Unless you want to share your meal with a few hundred rowdy people with no respect for you or anybody else). I might try BJ\'s again in a more civilized neighborhood  but very carefully."
Nikki T.,Las Vegas  NV,109,340,116,10/10/2012,1.0,I was trying the seating area for the first time... The waiter acted like he didn't want to be bothered.. and nobody damn smiled. I even asked one of the waitresses was it that bad there??? Either way.. I asked the waiter their opinion on some of the dishes and he acted like he ain't tasted nothing there. What the hell? No smiles- not friendly... OKAAAAY. I just said worst case scenario is I don't like it and you take i back since you have no recommendations. Sorry i don't eat BJ's like that *smh* THEN it wasn't even busy mind you  but his ass was tending to a table with 3 folks eating off one damn party wing plate more than he was me and my child who ordered 2 actual meals. So then after he visited their table at least 2/3 more times and walked off like there was no way in hell we needed something. I'm getting pissed because ONE my child wanted ketchup and I had to ask a host to get it and two  this is the second time I have had to ask someone who WAS doing their job on the tables they have been assigned to bring me some napkins and where the hell are you at??? THEN I asked a passing host where he was  clearly annoyed- looking at my empty azzed cup and she was like OMG (typical of him apparently). I will find him. I said yes please do and find your manager while you're at it- thanks. I sat with an empty cup for 6 minutes (parched like a mugg)  and yep I turned on a timer- before this fool brought a refill with the bill.. WTF???) OK... Yeah- get your manager. I let her know that their service sucked ass and if he don't like the job he has  in this economy- there is someone who will do it with a smile. This is why people don't like chains.. because folks is comfortable and it makes YOU as a manager look bad.. you need a new staff. I have seen about 2 people smiling here since I got here.. You might want to work on that. Yep.. me and the kid ate for 17 bucks. #goodnight and Sorry  I don't do crappy service  even at a discounted rate... I won't be back.
David G. B.,Los Angeles  CA,104,4,1,3/10/2011,4.0,Large food menu  good service and lots of big screen TV's to watch your favorite LA teams.
Janelle N.,Santa Monica  CA,64,127,37,10/3/2010,4.0,I've been a long time shopper at the Fox Hills Mall now called Westfield Shopping Center  and was thrilled to see actual resturaunts go up. Yes  the mall and perhaps the area itself is a bit ghetto as other people have stated but it's always been that way (at least for the past 20 years That I've been going). Anyways I pick up my friend from her long flight back to the states and we decide to get a bite to eat. Since I picked her up at LAX and her car was parked in Culver City  she suggests BJ's which Is nestled on the Target/Forever 21 side of the mall. Parking is a gigantic pain as the spots are always all occupied unless you go into the structure which will promise some walking. After a good solid meal  the last thing I want to do is walk! So it's Friday night about 8:30 pm and it's packed inside. The place is reminiscent of a TGIFridays. The wait is about 20 min so we head over to the bar area to have a drink. There are tons of beer selections as well as a full bar (joy!). The bartender made pretty solid drinks for a place like that. We finally get our table and the waitress was super friendly  sweet and attentive. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name but she was a pretty Asian chick. Also  the rest of the staff was friendly as well  greeting us as we walked by. We thumb through the menu which is equivalent to the Cheesecake Factorys menu...we're talking every kind of pasta  chilli  deep dish pizzas  sandwiches  comfort foods  lots of yummy dessert options like warmed cookies with ice cream  and the menu goes on and on. It's tough to choose as there are so many tasty options to choose from! We finally decide to split a deep dish south west pizza and avocado eggrolls for our appetizer. The eggrolls were hot  crunchy and flavorful...they just about melted in my mouth. Yum! The pizza was good too although I might be more inclined to get a classic pizza myself but it was still good. The deep dish are doughy just FYI for all you New York thin crust lovers. According to how many people were in there and how many people I see here while I'm shopping  I'd say this place is pretty popular.Im giving it 4 stars (for now) until I go back and have another taste of it. I will be back  I liked everything about this place and recommend it to people looking for a better version of TGIfridays  Cheesecake Factory  Chillis  Red Robin  Claim Jumper  etc. Not gourmet but it's good ol' comfort food in a nice atmosphere.
leah m.,Los Angeles  CA,56,22,57,3/28/2014,5.0,the hostess was amazing even know they were super busy! the chicken tortilla soup is to die for so is the pear cider beer blend. there is also a 19.95 special for a 3 course meal for 2. it won't be on the menu but you should ask for it between now and September 30th 2012! parking sucks! And a valet is 7 dollars which is pretty pricey. I'm told you can text when you are ready to pick up your car from inside the restaurant so it will be ready as soon as you walk outside. Otherwise awesome!
K H.,San Diego  CA,0,61,1,9/21/2012,4.0,Great food... great service and definitely price worthy for the meals you order and receive.. The pizookie is a must at this restaurant... A must visit when in LA...
Erik T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,12/2/2011,1.0,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.I have been to this BJs before (as well as others) and have never been treated so poorly. When I went to this specific one before  the waiter took a long time (which as a fellow server I can understand since it was busy) and the food was not too good. I go back another day at around 11:50pm. I was promptly seated by the hostess  and then waited 10-15 minutes for the server to get to us. Upon arriving the first thing to come out of his mouth was ""We close in an hour so you might want to get your order in now"". Seriously? It does not take an hour to microwave your food over there  and the rush was unappreciated. We tell him we were not ready to order and so he moves on (to serve the people in the bar as they were the only other people in the restaurant left). After 5 minutes of deciding we were ready to order  and yet again the server takes 15 minutes to get to us  kind of odd for a guy who wanted me and my girlfriend out so quickly. The rest of the night we were constantly rushed to get out and it was extremely uncomfortable. I mean we were eating for 10 minutes before he asked to box up our food. We weren\'t even done yet! Plus to top it off  the food again was not great. At the end we get the check and I leave a small (but undeserving) tip. As I said  I too am a server so I understand service  and this was not good service.Just to recap:-Don\'t go in AN HOUR before they close otherwise they rush you out.-Their food is not very tasty.-Be ready to wait a long time for any kind of service (except for the hostesses  I have never had a bad experience with them).It is really not that difficult to do your job servers  so please do it right. Get it together BJs."
Enzo A.,Pasadena  CA,84,56,23,3/15/2010,5.0,Good service  good food  great desserts - Oreo Pizookie was amazing!
Amie A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,2/6/2010,2.0,It's to pricey for the food you get and they give you way too much food. The service was great when they first opened and now the service is slow and gets worse every time I go back. From now on I'm avoiding this place
Kareen G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,3/2/2013,1.0,Your prices are too high. The food needs more seasoning. Your drinks are watered down  and I was disappointed eating at your restaurant yesterday. I would really want to be contacted for a refund.
Philip J.,Pacific Palisades  CA,94,191,3,3/4/2010,5.0,They gave us pizza while we waited! What a good start! Get the ice cream and cookie dessert too! Plenty of employees which was nice got seated quickly for it being so busy.
Justin T.,Glendale  CA,14,25,,12/19/2009,1.0,Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Our waitress was super late to greet us  went on break without telling us  didn't put my order in  so 40 minutes later the manager comes out to say he's sorry and that he'll come out to check on us and make sure everything is good. The food takes a further 15 minutes to come out  and when it comes out  all of my sides are wrong  and they're cold. The manager never comes to check on us  so I told the waitress to have him come over. Five minutes later  no manager  so I look at the door to the kitchen and when I catch his eye  he looks away like he didn't see me. He spends the rest of the time I'm there ducking me. The WORST. Flee from this place like it's on fire. I'd rather be punched in the face than have to go through that again.
Moon C.,Prunedale  CA,2,133,19,11/8/2009,1.0,"If I could rate the place a zero  I would.I have no clue what the food is like  because I never got mine. Seated promptly. Waited on fairly promptly. Received alcohol fairly promptly. At that point  server disappeared  and the clock just kept ticking. After a good 20 minutes plus I still had no food. Waitress finally cruised by  saying my food would be up ""soon"". I pointed out that a couple two tables away had received their food 5 minutes before she came by  at which point I was informed that they had ordered chicken (and I hadn\'t)  so (of course?) they got their food right away? WTF??? I had ordered an appetizer type dish  I might add  that can be served up in 2 minutes. Server then got uber-sickly sweet solicitous  very sarcastically over-polite  as if I was the one with the issue/problem. She offered to call the manager over  and then reacted as if she was very pissed off that I said yes  I wanted to see him. She oozed off. I saw her one more time  calling out to me that she was ""trying to find the manager."" Three minutes went by - no food  no waitress  no manager. I got up and walked out. Nothing anyone can say  no comp  nothing will induce me to return. The server was personally insulting to me as an individual. Apparently  this type of ""service"" is the rule rather than the exception at this BJs. I hope it goes out of business very soon."
Chris N.,Redondo Beach  CA,82,56,2,1/25/2010,5.0,I love this place. Their beer selection alone could get me in but the service tonight was exceptional. We went on Halloween and surprisingly we were seated in about 5 mins with a crowd waiting and the place packed. The server paid detailed attention to us and our order. Food was amazing and the pumpkin beer was awesome.
Bruce M.,Culver City  CA,5,138,22,10/22/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Read my main Review below ! then ... FYI - Got a call and email from corporate offering their apology for the bad ""experience"" and assurance they would try and make things better. Dont hold your breath! But  (and I say this with a big doubts...) Maybe if enough people complain to them via email from their website  they might  I say might be able to make some improvements. I\'m willing to hope that for the pizza gods and all the hard working folks spending their hard to come by dollars on eating out that they indeed do just that."
James B.,Los Angeles  CA,21,5,,7/1/2010,3.0,This BJ's is decent. I've been to 3 of them in total (this one  one in Westwood  and another in West Covina--West Covina is definitely the best out of the 3  but both are much better than the Westwood location). Most of the appetizers and salads are very good. Of course  the pizzookies are excellent. The reason this place only gets 3 stars is because the wait is usually relatively lengthy and the service is pretty bad usually. Occasionally you'll be able to get a good server  but most of the time you'll be waiting for a bit for your food.
Heather S.,Inglewood  CA,15,57,14,3/5/2010,4.0,Gotta redeem this place because of other bad reviews. I think if your going to this place in the evening or a weekend it's gonna be crowded and expect douchey people to try to get ahead of you and service to not be great. Not bad but not great. Went for lunch on a weekday and I thought the food was good and the service was quick and it was a packed house when we went. The reason it only gets 4 stars is the mid switch with waiters.
April M.,Los Angeles  CA,48,9,,11/3/2009,2.0,"I have been to the new BJ\'s in Culver City several times and it seems they are still getting the hang of things.The food was fine. The service....I have mixed feelings. It seems like the kitchen and wait staff are not in sync. My friend ordered soup and salad and I ordered a salad w/dressing on the side. The soup and salad came up right away so my friend waited until my salad arrived ten minutes later before eating. The wait staff did offer to get a new soup but at that point we just didn\'t feel like dealing with it.When we were half way through our meal another server took over because the first server was off. The new server introduced herself  fine. Then she came back six times to check in ""because she was bored""  didn\'t seem to care that it was disruptive. Then the server wanted to clear the table of dishes and what she couldn\'t reach asked me to hand to her....seems like odd service. The dressing was in a messy dish and I really didn\'t want to hand it to her but she asked so I felt obligated. Young staff. They don\'t seem to have much experience and then to be out of sync with the kitchen makes for a very bumpy dining experience.Parking is difficult. Plan on parking in the garage."
Niccolo R.,Los Angeles  CA,78,57,8,2/6/2010,4.0,The atmosphere is well lit  energetic  and upbeat. Food is typical of a brewpub  but they make excellent burgers  salads  salads and offer a good beer selection. For about $9.50 you can order a dish that will fill you up  and is very tasty. Plus  the desserts are dope  and the atmosphere is cool because of the hustle/bustle  and nice balance between well lit  yet faded lighting. I've been twice now and will definitely go back.
Andy D.,South Easton  MA,5,30,,7/12/2010,4.0,The pizza here is outstanding and the beer selection is superb. The BJ's brews are good  but don't overlook the non-BJ's beers they also have. I could really go for a pizzookie right now... As with most BJ's locations  this one tends to be on the busy side. While you're waiting for a table  just go to the bar and get a nice drink. There are a ton of tv's to keep you entertained while you wait too. I've been to this location more than 5 times and don't think the service is all that bad. It's fair to average when comparing to other large restaurants.
Kevin C.,Henderson  NV,0,26,,11/13/2010,3.0,Good food and nice beers but service sucks! SLOW! Good for sports too as tvs are everywhere!
Doug C.,Los Angeles  CA,2,4,,3/16/2014,2.0,"I can see why Yelp only gave this location 2.5 stars... We\'ve been here before  last time was bad  so management took care of us  and gave us a free meal certificate... So  we decided to use them today. And here we go again... The hostess was extremely rude and full of ghettotude! She saw us walk through the door  didn\'t even acknowledge us  a waitress told her that we were standing there and she said  ""yeah  I know...  she (the other NEW hostess)  got it..."" So after a few minutes we were sat...  one minute later the hostess comes back and says..sorry  I have to move you to a different table because there is no server for this table ."" WTF??? REALLY???...anyway the very nice server Victoria took our orders  everything seemed good...until we got our food...let\'s just say that the ""Oven-Roasted"" Mahi Mahi with stir-fried veggies and pineapple fried rice was more like ""Oven-Roasted"" piece of shit jerky with stir-fried grass and oil flavored steamed white rice! Just plain NASTY!! Our pizza  well let\'s just say I\'ve had better ""FROZEN"" microwave pizza...this is TRULY PATHETIC because I really like this place. Well the management took care of us  but unfortunately  we ARE NOT coming back to this location...on their WORST DAY  the Westwood location is way better...better service  especially the HOSTESS...ALL of those that gave this place 3+ stars....WTF we\'re thinking??? Are you friends of some of the employees?? SOB!!"
Dia P.,Windsor Hills  CA,33,40,27,11/5/2009,4.0,I really like BJs  they are all great. I mean i always look for the quality  you definitely gotta consider if they are clean or not. ( Get Those Dirty Thoughts outta your head!) lol. I like Their Food  especially their Pizza.. Yummmmm  the best that i have had. It's other great example of a Classic Sports Bar/ Restaurant. i like the layout it's really cool. I just really wish that the lobby was Bigger  because it gets so crowded at times. I believe that this is the exact thing that Culver City Needs.
P B.,Brooklyn  NY,22,44,4,3/5/2010,1.0,"My husband is a self-admitted pizza monster  so while we were in the area we decided to hit up the new BJ\'s. Such a mistake. I ordinarily try to avoid chain restaurants  but on this night we just wanted some pizza and beer and thought they might be able to deliver. Wrong.After a 45 minute wait which we didn\'t really mind  we were greeted by our server who spoke to us like we were in Kindergarten. I made a trip to the ladies room where I almost slipped and fell on my face when I walked through the door in a puddle of an unknown foreign substance (it wasn\'t water!). I browsed my stall options to find piss and human fecal matter on every toilet surface. I decided to hold it.The next hour and a half of my life would be the most difficult efforts to stuff my face that I\'ve ever been through. When our food arrived along with our first and only round of beer and water  we were promptly alerted to the fact that there was no silverware or plates to be had. From there  we shared a pizza and tried to get out as quickly as possible. We spent the next hour or so waiting for our check.I\'d like to think I\'m a fantastic tipper. Having worked in the restaurant industry when I was a struggling barely old enough to drink Angelino  I\'d like to think I learned to take pity on servers. Not tonight my dear yelpers  not tonight. I left a whopping $4.05 and vowed to never return to the Fox Hills Mall or BJ\'s ever again.It\'s no wonder the wait was so long. Our server came by once to take our order and once to give us our check. We did have a random server bring us our beers. Other than that  we were basically left to our own devices. The only amusing part of the night was getting to see the patrons dressed up in SUITS like this was some sort of place to be. Are you kidding me? This is BJ\'s folks  not exactly ""fine dining"".FYI - a small cheese pizza has far fewer calories than most of their salads. Portions are out of control large and equally overpriced  even at this $ level. It\'s no wonder why America is so FAT!"
janet v.,Culver City  CA,0,20,,4/26/2011,2.0,Why am I not surpised that others seem to have the same bad service. I stood at the take out window waiting to place my order for 10 minutes. A waitress was there but she was busy counting her tips and didn't even get eye contact with me until I finally asked is anyone working here? She explained that the girl was in the back and should be up front shortly. so I wait and watch this woman count her money. Finally she decides to go look for the young lady.  I'm still waiting. So now I ask the hostest if anyone is working here and explains that she's in the back and she will go get her. (is this woman cooking the meals?) Now I'm mad and ask for a manager. When the manger finally comes she makes excuses for why the lady was not at the take out window. And was more interested in the young lady counting her tips.If you work as a waitress or waiter keep in mind that tips are not manditory!T - ToI - InsureP - PromptS - Service
Theodore P.,Los Angeles  CA,29,19,,7/27/2012,3.0,"There\'s nothing more disappointing than to score a table at a highly touted restaurant only to discover that it does not meet the hype. Such flaws can mar an experience such as a boring wine list  errors in presentation  exorbitant prices. Some places exceed your expectations for a lesser price and give solace to an otherwise perilous experience. One such place is BJ\'s. I\'m going figuratively commando as always here in terms of naming assigning it the gastropub. In fact  I will say enshrine it as ""family friendly"" which is not always pejorative term. Perfect lighting  a decent menu. A cheerful and helpful waiter with a generous sense of humor. In LA waiters aren\'t always as self aware of their other profession. I despise when they pretend it\'s a novelty to be a an actor rather than just having a great time. We had the best two waiters that demanding NY\'ers could imagine. Tried different drinks and oh the food wasn\'t bad either. I\'m not saying what I ordered because I already appear as a fat ass from previous reviews. This is a good mid-week casual restaurant."
Whitney H.,Los Angeles  CA,236,176,34,11/29/2009,3.0,The lunch specials during the week are really the reason to go to BJ's. On the weekend it gets crowded and the service is slow. The food is pizza  burger  salad American. Average  do-able  chain food.
Jay R.,Culver City  CA,0,21,,8/26/2011,2.0,I can't seem to understand this place at all. I like the chain and have had great times at other locations. The bummer is that I live around the corner from here. I go here on my own and with my family. When I go with my family the service is awful. The food is always good  but the service and the attitude is completely perplexing. The greeters seem disinterested when you walk in. We always go early to avoid the craziness. We have had mostly bad service experiences. Sometimes I want to go and serve myself. Just show me where things are and I will take care of it. Westfield has sunk a lot of money into this mall  but maybe this wasn't the right restaurant call.
MS F.,Venice  CA,55,58,,4/2/2013,1.0,Went for a quick bite today around 3 with my friend. The hostess with dark hair in a bun was no where to be found. When she finally sauntered up to the hostess stand she acted like were imposing on her to even be there. We asked for a table for two. She looked at me like I had three heads and tried to steer me and my friend to the bar for happy hour. When we said no that we just wanted a table to have lunch she seemed clueless. She left us hanging and proceeded to talk to another couple who had also been waiting for at least 2 to 3 minutes. We were still table less  yet there were several tables and several wait staff walking around and not busy. She then headed toward the kitchen across the restaurant and out of sight again. Where the hell was she going??? On the way out of the kitchen she hugged a waitress who just came in for her shift. WTF???? We are still standing here waiting for a table while she socializes. I have never seen such lack of urgency or concern for a job in my life. She came back and said that it was going to be another few minutes as they had to clean a table. Are you kidding me at this point???? It was time to walk out and we did...Management needs to get rid of this so called hostess! Worst customer service ever!
Danae H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,7/19/2012,1.0,i ordered a chicken salad and it came out without even chicken on it. not a big deal but the guy brought me out a chicken breast on a plate as an apology so i had to break it apart into pieces with my hand to put it in my salad. we paid mid meal considering we had hour parking. i left before my boyfriend so i could go check on the car and my boyfriend said as he got up a blonde worker ran to our table right in front of him and looked at our check to make sure we paid. how rude. i will not be back to this bjs. the one in arlington  tx (brand new) that im used to going to is much better. this one is crowded and bad service.
Hector A.,Marina del Rey  CA,9,23,,2/26/2012,3.0,The beer is the real reason to come here along with a pazooki. The problem with this place has to be with parking  there is nothing nearby. I felt the food was ok  but I remember having better food at other BJ restaurants. I think the staff was great  but the food was just ehh  I would prefer CPK now.
Felicia T.,Las Vegas  NV,79,276,192,10/20/2009,4.0,I am used to the BJ's in Westwood. and waiting around forever (30-40 minutes easy) has gotten kinda old. Also my last couple trips there have almost killed BJ's for me. The sliders came out cold  Fries also cold. And Fish and chips were greasy (I understand its fried. I expect fresh out the fryer grease  but NOT sit on the-counter-too-long-the-oil-has-set kind of) grease. Also i always felt rushed eating at this location  to make way for UCLA kids eating in groups of 10 or so. right. Then i drove by a couple months ago  and it looks like a new location is opening in the new Westfield Mall (used to be Fox Hills mall). Along with a new Target (which is Super Target by the way). Yippeeeeee.. since it is close to work! I love finding new lunch spots :)I stayed off the first 3 weeks after opening  which was smart i think  since i am reading tons of negative reviews on bad service  slow and disorganized staff. Also a friend of mine went  and said the wait was forever. It just opened. So i let them work out their kinks. Went today  deciding i am ready. And so are they. parking is free in the mall structure (hooray). We got there around 12:30. No wait  got seated immediately. Server was very nice and attentive and never pressured us to order. Their lunch specials are great! You can get a half salad/ soup/ sandwich (pick and pair 2) for $6.95  and fries included with the sandwich! Or unlimited Caesar salad with soup (free refills) for $6.95. I ended up getting the Pulled Pork Sliders (comes with regular or Wedge Fries.. Get the Wedges!) $6.95. For that price  you get 4 sliders! Definitely a very generous portion for lunch. And the sauce on it was so tangy delicious  i wanted to lick them off my plate. Value wise  they've won me over. Table service was very good  kitchen was a little slower. But we didnt mind. The place is clean and there are TV's to keep you occupied. I didn't get any of their brews this time  since I have to go back to work. And people seem to notice when i come back from lunch wide-eyed  looking too happy and with rosy cheeks. sad. I've had beer at the other location and i love their Blonde and Piranha.
Jimmy R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,6/2/2012,2.0,"This restaurant just keeps on letting me down. I\'m not exaggerating but this is my 3rd bad experience at this location. I can\'t seem to avoid this place because my fiance loves their pizza I have to say food is great service very disappointing. For example to day I decided to order curb side pick up too avoid going in to the restaurant. Yet again the service was bad even on the phone. A girl answer the phone and all she said was ""hello"" I had to ask whether I had the correct number or if I was calling BJ\'s. Second she cut me off in mid sentence by saying ""hold on"" so I\'m on hold. When she finally came back on the line she asked for my name and "" what do I want to order"" after I finished placing my order she simply said "" be ready in 20 minutes"" and click."
Chris M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,8,,2/6/2012,2.0,When ever I come to bj's I usually order the balsamic chicken because it is consistantly good. However  I ventured off the path of delicious chicken after getting made fun of for my predictable order and decided to go with the shrimp tacos... Terrible idea  I have loved the shrimp tacos at almost every place I have ever tried them but not here.. For 10 bucks you get 2 dinky little tacos with shrimp that tasted a little to ripe for my liking if you know what I mean.. Also their house salad is like 4 bucks and its nothing but a small plate of like costco iceberg mix or something... After many disapointing salads and now the shrimp tacos I will be taking my business else where.
ashley c.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,,10/25/2010,2.0,I actually really like BJs for what it is -- good solid bar food. This particular BJs however  has the most incompetent staff I have experienced. In the three times I have been there my order has been messed up  things like drinks and sides that should be relatively simple to deliver in a timely fashion have taken FOREVER and it has been a generally frustrating experience. Please BJs  do something about your waitstaff!
Kim C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,26,5,11/16/2011,1.0,Nothing quite like waiting 30 minutes at your table for a server to take your drink order let alone your food order on a random Tuesday at 2:00 pm when at least half of their seats are free. The waitress made eye contact with my multiple times  yet still did not come over to take my order. Finally  when I flagged down a busboy  he got another waitress to help me who wasn't even working my section. When my actual waitress brought my food over  she didn't say anything  ask for a refill on my water  and then it took her another 30 minutes to give me my check. I will never go back to this BJ's. WORST SERVICE IN HISTORY!!!!
R D.,Calabasas  CA,0,7,,3/14/2012,1.0,Overpriced Chain Restaurant--more so for dinner but I don't see what the hype is. Their menu looks like something from the Cheesecake Factory  has a million things on it. I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken based off of the picture they had. Well my salad looked nothing like the one pictured. They forgot about 3/4's of the salad  you would think for $13 you would get a decent salad. Ridiculous. Overpriced and overseasoned  and the waiter didn't listen (dressing on the side  etc). Won't be going back. Also too noisy!
mia s.,Los Angeles  CA,1,3,,10/27/2009,3.0,Went to BJ'S twice since it's opening and the service is so-so. We ordered the sampler appetizer which was 15 bucks! wHEW. Can we say recession. The selection of beers are extensive and the cocktail list is very basic aqs this restaurant specializes in BEER! Pretty good experience so fqar. Love the big screens so thaat you can watch the game
Danny S.,Los Angeles  CA,226,38,1,12/27/2010,4.0,i love the nachos  and the ice cream  the service is good  and the bathroom is clean .. floors are kind of slippery
Mike W.,Inglewood  CA,0,7,,11/9/2009,3.0,"Been here twice. Truth be told this isn\'t the place to go for great food...it\'s a place to go to grab a beer  see a game  maybe make a new friend  and people watch. It\'s the new ""Fridays"" since Friday\'s in the Ladera Center is very played out. The food here is drowned in butter and salt...seriously...and I eat damn near anything...no diets here...but sheesh  can BJ\'s possibly make their meals more buttery/salty?? I din\'t think it\'s humanly possible. My food was basically a salt lick!! Also  since this place is still fairly new be prepared to deal with long wait times and less than top notch service  but I hear they\'re ""working on it""..lol...Overall I\'d say this place is okay...if you\'re looking for somewhere to drink beer and be social that is : )"
P F.,San Francisco  CA,1,43,2,7/5/2011,5.0,This location is one of my favorite places for happy hour. Yes  it can get crowded  but it never takes too long to find a seat in the bar unless a good game is on. The bartenders/servers are very nice. I once noticed the portions were getting smaller so I kindly suggested they reconsider and management seemed to appreciate the comment and take action. I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for a lively environment. It's also great for late night dining which seems somewhat rare in Culver City.
Ibeth C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,8/31/2012,2.0,Food is great but the service is ridiculous all around. From the wait to being seated to the food. Hostess is rude and never checks to see if any empty tables available. The one we were seated at was free for 15 min until I started complaining and surfing the area for a table. The waiter pretty incompetent did not place our appetizers nor did he realized he did not until other waiters came to our table with our entrees. Not only were the appetizers never placed but my jambalaya wasn't ordered either. My food arrived right when everybody else had finished their meal. We asked for extra silverware and soy sauce and it took us 4 times to request it to different people because our waiter failed to do his job. He totally ignored our requests and what's worse never apologized for any of it until the end. And of course he wanted a tip so he had to apologize. This place totally moves around the bar and the rest is forgotten. if you can't run a business don't open it. It wastes good quality time and good food that people trust to come and find without hesitation. Customer is first above all especially if you want them coming back. Never going back to this location so far Burbank it will be.
Danny T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,23,,7/21/2010,4.0,Great BBQ Chicken Pizza  good mac & cheese! Their home brewed Hefeweizen is very good too  great selection of beer on tap! Parking is tough sometimes since the place is in a mall  but they do offer valet parking. I would definitely recommend going there!
Jason H.,Los Angeles  CA,41,33,1,10/11/2009,2.0,This place had good food but horrible service. The waiters/waitresses didnt know who they were serving  my waiter told me that the restaurant didnt have crushed pepper  then i asked another server and they told me that they did. When I first arrived the host wasnt organized to sit us down in order of arrival and there was a bunch of commotion at the front because of it. I ordered an alcoholic beverage when we were first seated I didnt recieve it til after I got my food. ANd dont go to BJs if you have an out of state ID because when I showed my out of state ID the waiter had to take it to the owner who had to walk away and do something with it and then they brought it back to me. I have never been through such a security clearance check to get a drink in my life and I am balding so I know I look over 21. I would not suggest bringing a date there unless you want to prove to her how you will yell at anyone to get some service for her. Maybe go to the bar and eat cuz it sounded like they have good happy hour specials and hopefully better service
prinay a.,Hayward  CA,2,6,,3/21/2010,1.0,I was on a weekend trip to LA  stayed near the culver city westfield mall. i have alwasy been a big fan of BJ's. i have to say this was by far the WORST ones ever. When we reached there  i asked for the wait time for a table since it was crowded. i was told 10-15mins. we waited for 45 mins before we got our table  we ordered the drinks and took like another 45mins minutes to just get our drinks  it was just one water n 2cokes. We ordered our food and it took another 40mins for the food. They have very little to no service. i got my food first   then a second waiter got my sisters food  my wife waited another 20mins till she got her food. I have never got this kind of service at any place. it was HORRIBLE. i highly recommend NOT GOING to this Restaurant in Culver city. Also im the guy who left u a penny in tip......but u guys did everything to deserve it too. Thanks
Natasha j.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,10/27/2009,2.0,Not as i thought. I was excited to try a new place that opened near my house. A total let down  just like the Planet hollywood Casino in Vegas over the weekend but thats another story. The floors were worse than the Grand lux  Any woman that wears heels thats been there knows what i mean  they were way to slippery my friends had to hold me just so i could walk to our table  And walk out.I understand that they were fairly new and the place would be packed but they took forever with the food and drinks. the drinks were strong so if your trying to get tipsy  bj's is perfect for you.Also  I ordered calamari  huge mistake  it was terribly dry  un seasoned  it totally tasted like rubber  and it made me sick. My friends ordered a appetizer sampler which was good  not great  the same thing you'd get from anywhere else  so we all shared that since we were scared to order anything else.I also ordered a dirty martini  another huge mistake. plus it was late and i saw teens there  why didnt this place have a curfew  lol.I'm thinking about going back (if i have anyone to go with since every1 hated it) hoping that this was just a first-timers fluke.
Che Mari M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,5,,9/5/2010,2.0,Hmm....where to begin... service not so good...confused on who my waiter was. They changed ever 5 seconds. The pizza was good but could have been a deeper dished. The pizookie at the end was a nice treat. Question is...will I be back?
Jennifer H.,Los Angeles  CA,2,56,,7/6/2012,4.0,I am picky and I was really worried about this place after reading all the other reviews  but I have to say that our experience was definitely not like most reported. We had some relatives in town and everyone was coming from different directions.  With the Wilshire ramp off the #405 closed I thought that this would be an easy place to meet and the food should satisfy the kids as well as the adults. I am a healthy eater and wasn't too excited about what I say on the internet but I can occasionally put up with a night of unhealthy eating. The only thing we didn't like was that they didn't take reservations. You could call an hour or so in advance. I don't remember the exact procedure but they explained it over the phone and we had a table waiting after following the instructions. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Not everyone arrived at once but she brought drinks for those who ordered first and then came back when another group arrived. I was pleasantly surprised to find some healthy options on the menu and even happier when the food arrived. I had an Seared Ahi Tuna Salad which was delicious. The kids seemed happy with their pizza and mozzarella sticks. Other entrees sampled included pasta and fish dishes. Everyone was pleased with their choice. Drinks were refilled in timely manner. We weren't rushed and our waitress was attentive to just the right degree. The restaurant wasn't too noisy and the restrooms were clean. Parking did take a little time  my suggestion is don't try to park outside  go directly to the indoor mall parking. Yes  you'll have to walk a little but then you might not feel as bad about ordering a dessert. BJ's isn't on my regular foodie list  but I would definitely come back in a similar circumstance.
freshkidd T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,,7/28/2010,1.0,This BJ's has really bad service. It's so bad to the point we didn't even sit down. The hostess just walked around like there wasn't three different parties that need to be seated. I got so pissed that I didn't even want to eat there anymore. A lady was even walking around looking for her waitress to take her order. WOW!!!
Jason L.,Chino Hills  CA,56,8,,3/12/2012,1.0,dont go here at all.. go somewhere else and eat... they have one the worst staff and management.. i came here for my girlfriend's birthday and our food came 40 minutes late where everyone else got their food  so in totally we waited like an hour and 40 minutes for fcking good.. our waitress was horrible too.. AVOID THIS PLACE
Gina N.,Los Angeles  CA,6,17,,3/23/2012,1.0,I've been to this BJs location quite a few times  mainly because its nearby and convenient for me and a few friends in the area. I like their beer and flatbread margharita pizza. Unfortunately  THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!! Some of the worst service I've ever had. Long waits for everything  including something as simple as a napkin and water. The waitstaff has an attitude  not everyone but its more likely you'll get a shitty server than a nice one. Not to mention some of the crowd here can be just as rude as the waitstaff. I had a guy in the bar area tell me I had just sat at the booth he was waiting on. Well the bar area is open seating  no names on a list type of thing. The ladies sitting at the table before me offered the table as they were getting up. How did I take his seat? It's like a parking space scenario  get over it. He proceeded to be rude as me and my son sat at the table. Real classy folks at this establishment.
Marcus R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,2,11/18/2009,2.0,I made a reservation for my wife's birthday at 8 pm  guess what?? One hour later I got my table. the staff ishorrible  really horrible  they bring you beer first and the glasses after 30 minutes  actually and the end we were having fun to see how bad they are.... The beer is ok  price is really good  I had a party for 10 people   I order few appetizers and enough beer and I spent $ 200   it wasn't bad  dont worry about tip because they are so bad you won't pay a lot  and about the next day is totally true  a lot of gas going on  stomach pain but you know you get what u Paid. ...Good Luck
