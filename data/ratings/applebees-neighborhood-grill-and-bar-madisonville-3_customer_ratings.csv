0,Lee J.,"Lompoc, CA",12,49,38.0,2.0,2013-04-02,This particular Applebees is hit or miss. Consistent service is never delivered and the food is bad one night and plain mediocre the next. Great for large groups as the menu is simple and caters to most pallets.  Locals seem to enjoy the bar the best. The bar is always packed except on Sundays. Price right. Food is unimpressive. Service is severely lacking.  Servers are mostly teens. As a guest don't expect much attention. Drinks will basically go flat awaiting a top off  from your server. The most disturbing fact is that this location seemed to change managing teams every few months. No consistency!   The trick is don't have high expectations and you won't be let down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
5,Randall B.,"Madisonville, KY",0,5,1.0,1.0,2015-04-17,"Service is slow. Food is generic. Drinks are not very liberal. And be careful not to have more than one drink, the staff will call the police! Not all Applebee's are this way, some are run well and have quality food and service. Regional manager should pay more attention and clean house. I'm generous with the star, can't post less than 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
6,Dana S.,"Ranger, GA",25,70,58.0,5.0,2015-06-04,Food was great! My server Jill was awesome. I went for dinner and had the wonton tacos and they were great. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff. I will be back the next time I'm in Madisonville.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
1,Mary L.,"Delco, NC",18,39,2.0,1.0,2015-07-27,I must say this has to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had at an Applebee's.  If you want to eat your appetizers off of napkins get your food order come out wrong and not get another drink after your first than his place is for you... If not stay away!!!!! If you do decide to go there stay away from Lyndsie for your waitress!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
7,Christopher K.,"Bremen, KY",0,29,,2.0,2015-11-15,Terrible place. Food is very bland. Entrees taste microwaved with that dried over look. Even after a huge renovation this establishment is lacking in both service and in fare. Sadly tho apple bees is better than the other options in town. Drive on to evansville and buy a half way descent meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
2,Terry T.,"Providence, KY",29,10,,1.0,2016-06-18,Hostess was rude. Waiter took 15 minutes to get to the table. Got drinks wrong. Set for 25 minutes without drinks. Food was cold when we got it. Brought refills and they were all wrong.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
4,Jim M.,"Madisonville, KY",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-28,This used to be a fine restaurant but not any more. Restaurant and bar service are both inept if not downright rude. Food is uninspired and salads such as the oriental chicken salad have become nothing but lettuce and chicken nuggets. Applebees should take its name off  this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
3,Justin B.,"Murray, KY",3,68,3.0,2.0,2016-11-23,"1.5 Stars: I have been looking for a good burger since moving to Kentucky. I tried this location hoping to get a decent burger and fries. My first mistake was not sitting at the bar. My second mistake was not walking out. I was sat in the bar area then about a minute later another couple was sat at the table next to me. The server was flirting with a table of guys and after 5 minutes noticed there were new tables. I actually think one of the guys pointed it out to her. She took drink orders from both tables and I ordered my meal at the same time.  My iced tea came out in exactly 22 minutes followed in 56 seconds by my meal. I'm not that anal, I was looking at the time on the tv. The fries were over peppered for my taste and the burger was slightly charred. To be fair, my server was very attentive after the table of guys left. She came to the table 4 times after my meal was served. The couple next to was noticeably upset. The Guy, who waited 22 minutes for a beer ordered the second one early (smart guy). She wouldn't bring it to him until he ""was low"" missing the whole point of ordering early. He finished the beer and slid it across the table. A few minutes later the server brings a replacement and says ""see I took care of you.""  Wow, late and still bragging about being on time. She did apologize for the slow service at the end and said I'd have a better experience next time. No thanks, I'll try another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-madisonville-3,,,,,
