2,Sonna E.,"Quincy, IL",3,78,,3.0,2012-05-11,"Quite pricey but the food is usually good. Had my very first Green Bean Fries here! And you can put their Jack Daniels sauce on anything and make it good. The seating here is terrible though. The chairs are so high it's like you're eating off your knees. The booths are very tight and the table is fixed in place so you can't give one side any extra space. Honestly, I don't eat here soley because of the seating. It's that uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quincy,,,,,

If you want a change of pace, order the fried green beans for an appetizer.  I know it doesn't sound that good but they were delish!  We ate them faster than the spinach dip (and that is always eaten quickly)! I tried their peach tea for the first time.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness.  Not so sweet that you feel you need to brush your teeth, but enough to make the tea very tasty. I ordered and chicken and shrimp dish, but can't recall the name.  The chicken was very tender and juicy and the shrimp was in a sweet heat kind of sauce.  Again, tasty. I always enjoy my time at TGI Fridays and this was no different...minus them singing Happy Birthday to me.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-quincy,,,,,
