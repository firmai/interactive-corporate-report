Emily P.,"Lafayette, CO",92,107,324,5.0,11/22/2017,"So ... my boss splurged ... and we ordered 10 delicious meals and 8 desserts ... TO GO! Not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination! I called and ordered over the phone with Dana. She was patient, focused, and sooooo sweet! She repeated each order back to me, and verified the pick up time. When I arrived the food was piping hot (which rarely happens with take out food), and Dana and Alexandria (I think that's what her name was- also super efficient and friendly) were writing the names I provided for each and every meal and dessert on the individual containers. Wow!  Thank you! It made my delivery at work so much easier! Annnnnnd ... each meal and each dessert was delicious. No complaints from my picky picky office mates. First time everrrrrrr! I happen to be a super picky salmon person. My grilled salmon was super delicious. Usually when I order salmon at a restaurant I can't eat it.  It has to be grilled to perfection. Cheesecake Factory - awesome job!!! Thank you! Other dishes we ordered ? Cheesecake (duh). Yummy!  Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken ... excellent reviews from both people eating it.  Salads - big, healthy, and devilish. There is a healthy portion of the menu called ""skinny- Licious""... accurate description. Healthier, lighter food. So!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for the delicious food, spectacular customer service, and for going above and beyond what we expected!  Happy Holidays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder
Amber M.,"Black Hawk, CO",260,214,235,2.0,10/26/2017,"The menu here is huge, so you should be able to find something you like. Unless, of course, you want something healthy. I ordered the ""Almond-Crusted Salmon Salad"", a menu item labeled as a ""Superfood Salad."" It contained fresh, quality ingredients, but was fully saturated in an oily dressing and the salmon was coated with what appeared to be a mayonnaise-based sauce. Some dressing and sauces are nice, but this was too much. It was too heavy for me to finish and that should not happen with a simple salmon salad. I looked up the calories on CalorieLab and that menu item contains 1,200 calories. That's crazy for a salad.  The service was fine and the place seemed clean, but beware the menu items. Things that sound healthy definitely are not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder
Paulette D.,"Denver, CO",189,69,237,4.0,8/25/2017,"My friend and I ended up here after wandering around watching the street performances. She had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before and was ""hoping they will have something she liked"". Haha! We walked in and were promptly sat at a nice table outdoors. Our waiter was extremely attentive and we were quickly served water and our choice of wine. We decided to get a bottle and it came out in a nice wine carrier and our waiter kept it flowing as we were pouring over the endless food options.  Of course Colorado pulled its typical weather heist and it went from a bright blue sunny day to a torrential downpour in a couple of minutes. As soon as it started a multitude of servers ran outside to help everyone bring their stuff inside and re-sat. Great service!  My friend and I then received our food. We ordered the mac and cheese burger with sweet potato fries and the chicken club sandwich; both of which we shared. My friend was very pleased with both, as was I. The burger was cooked perfectly to our liking, it would have been even better if the mac and cheese covered the whole burger. The chicken sandwich was good and cooked very nicely with great bread. The only food problem we had was the sweet potato fries. They were not crispy, and lacked flavor. The regular fries were good so we shared those. At the end of our meal we shared a piece of strawberry cheesecake, which was good, but not great. We also received coupons for a free piece of cheesecake when we visit next. Yum!  Overall we had a good experience at the Cheesecake factory and would visit this location again if the craving came.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder
Ricky N.,"Broomfield, CO",95,29,3,5.0,8/10/2017,"Right when you walk in, the atmosphere is entrancing at best. ( depending on the time you walk in ) for me it's 930pm. I can hear myself think and engage in a conversation. It's lightly dimmed, music is very retro but soothing and you can truly appreciate the decor at thus time of the night.  I am thoroughly enjoying our waitress as well. She's very welcoming and she has a an almost homely feel to her by her personality. She's quite engaging on the menu options as well. Moving to the food quite a bit to just do taste tests and I can happily say the food was amazing.  Fresh in every sense and seasoned perfectly. I almost regretted swallowing it. While i am no connoisseur when it comes to fine dining, I know what I enjoy and don't and to my amazing surprise I tried something I've never tried in my life and am in love. I highly recommend coming here at night just so you may get a mere glimpse into what I had experienced here tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder

Tricia R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,179,84,4.0,4/26/2017,"NOMS! My fiance and I had a show at the Boulder Theater and saw The Cheesecake Factory was next door. We decided to have a nice dinner before the show, and the Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint! It was prom night, so it was definitely busy but we still got seated rather quickly for showing up on the fly, (about 15 minutes wait). The staff was super friendly and nice. The waitress we had was great and not only was she nice, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered our questions about with ease. The food was incredibly delicious, no complaints whatsoever. They also had Moscatto wine, which is my absolute favorite so I was pretty stoked about that. The place, while busy, was clean and tidy. I'm glad we decided to stop in. If we end up back in the area, we'll definitely stop back by for some more tasty goodness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder

Paul W.,"Boulder, CO",76,148,14,2.0,10/23/2016,"Having enjoyed their dinners from time to time, I expected the same quality for breakfast, in this case, Sunday brunch. Given how many amazing restaurants Boulder has on display, it's always seemed silly to me to venture into The Cheesecake Factory, a standardized chain found in many US cities. My adventure started with a sour, fermented grapefruit juice which tasted as it it were somebody else's drink - one that was left in the back of the bar for a few days. In case this is news to you, grapefruit juice should taste fresh and delightful, not as if it were scooped from an old, icy, cardboard container and microwaved. I sent it back and stuck with water. The water tasted like coffee. We're off to a great start! I asked for extra butter and was given 3 tiny tabs, as if butter is a dangerously low commodity for this multi-million dollar chain. How about fresh organic butter? Ya know, the stuff that doesn't give you cancer? Oops, too expensive!  In the same vein, I suppose it's too much to ask to have maple syrup that's made of, ya know, maple syrup. The maple syrup I was served poured so quickly from the tiny metal pitcher that it could only be sugar-water. Providing real maple syrup must be far too much of an inconvenience and expense for a one-person $20 tab. Note to manager: This is Boulder, where we expect food to be made of food, especially if it's labeled that way. Given that it's not maple syrup, this makes you yet another corporate conglomerate lying to customers, feeding them crap that makes the sicker and fatter. Good on ya mate!  The partially sprouted tomatoes on my plate of Crab Hash were clearly grown in a hot-house, born from GMO and had their flavor surgically removed. They seemed to have a sign on them that said ""Not to be eaten!"" The hash was pretty good, but only God knows what types of crappy, cancerous oils they used to make it. My plate was drenched in oil. I should probably get checked for lesions. When I looked at my second pancake (beneath the pretty one on top), it was only partially formed, kinda like Pacman. Its mouth drooped open as if to say, ""the cook was lazy today, please look away from my decaying mouth.""  I asked the hostess to move my seat further down the windows but was told ""that section would not have a server for some time"", as if walking 12 feet was too dangerous and complex an expedition for my waitress. The reason I wanted to move was because the hillbilly couple next to me was so enthralled with hating muslims and gay people - and blowing Trump that I could not stand listening to them. My little move request make sense now honey?  I mean it's wonderful that you have a snippy, corporate barbie doll at the host desk, but it would be nice if she also had a soul. Too much to ask? I'll have to come back here to test the dinner menu, but I think I'll wait until AFTER I eat at every other Boulder restaurant, cafe and 7-11. Thanks so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder
Oscar D.,"Denver, NC",6,11,2,1.0,7/30/2017,"We were in Boulder for the day with some friends and thought we stop at cheesecake factory since we know we like their food. Everything started out okay, the bartender came over and got us drinks and got us some bread. Then we waited and waited after a while we noticed that no one in the restaurant was getting your food. At around after waiting about 45 minutes and looking around to see if we were going to be served the manager finally came over and told us that they were a little bit backed up in the kitchen and our food willwill be out in five minutes. He didn't apologize or offer any kind of a restitution. We then noticed that he was doing the same to each table. Our waiter was not very attentive and when we told told him that we were tired of waiting he just kind of laughed it off.  It looks like they were shorthanded and poorly managed so most tables did not get the attention that would be expected, we certainly didn't. Also the bathrooms were dirty and no one seemed to care and the food was under cooked, when it finally came out. Overall it was about an hour and 40 minutes before we were done with our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder

Le C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"I took my wife here for her birthday and although the server was a very nice kid...there was a huge issue. First, my kid ordered a hamburger well done and it came out rare.  Not cool!   Secondly my wife used to love their Potato soup and it was on the menu this day.  She ordered it and the Server brought it to the table.  She took a few bites and noticed something was not right.  She asked the Server why it tasted so strange and he took it back to the kitchen. Get this...he came back with this explanation...the kitchen ran out of potato soup and just substituted it for clam chowder!  Did not tell her just sort of made that decision for her.  Well my wife hates sea food and became very sickened at the fact that she was duped into eating a meal she did not want. The manger took a few bucks off the meal and explained that the kitchen will sub foods it runs out of. Sometimes they won't ask or tell you that you are eating something you did not order!

When I went here I realized they are a jack of all meals but master of none. Portions were medium. I got the Thai wraps, Thai pasta and chicken parm pizza. The last one was not good. The first two were decent but you get much better Asian food at an Asian rest. The waiter talked me out of the dish I was orig going to get and suggested the crappy ckn parm pizza.

Chan R.,"Windermere, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Had a terrible experience here for my brothers birthday. I had family visiting from another country and we wanted a special meal out to celebrate a birthday. It was awful.  The server was extremely rude and nonchalant, almost like we were a bother to her. Some of the meals came out cold (one pasta dish (that's was for a child!), and two steak dishes). They were taken away and said they would be remade. When they came out it was obvious they had just been reheated. The pasta was rubbery and still had the cheese on that was added after it got to the table and the steaks came out well done, when they were initially medium.  The server kept saying ""whatever"" without a care in the world and the so called manager just came out with a creepy smile and acted like everything was great! We ended up paying a rather hefty bill with no apology just ""whatever"" from the server. We didn't want to cause a scene since it was a birthday celebration but thanks to this location it was ruined. Have never had an experience like this at a Cheesecake Factory before.

We order at 10:05 only to have to wait 35 minuets for our omelets. The side of breakfast potatoes amounted to 7-8 tiny pieces, maybe 3 bites. The toast came UNBUTTERED only to be given rock hard butter after flagging down the waiter. The omelets themselves were bland. The bacon, onion, mushroom and cheese were one goop thrown in the middle of an egg blanket. Finally, the waiter never checked back in, never refilled our drinks, and seemed disinterested in service.

It felt like he was being really ageist. We got absolutely nothing. I don't even know his name because he didn't introduce himself or anything. Also I'm pretty sure the woman who brought out our food was sick. She could barely talk and that's usually because of a virus. Great. A woman with a virus served our food.

Amy E.,"South Boulder, CO",891,259,,2.0,2/10/2015,"I'm updating my last review based on a recent experience with the service at CF. My previous review regarding the food still stands, so please take a look at it for that aspect. We'd always had good service at this CF, but our most recent experience was fairly terrible. We visited around 4:30pm on Friday, February 6. The place was mostly empty, but there was no hostess at the front. We waited a few minutes. The manager (I believe) finally walked by and helped us. (We appreciated that, because some managers at some places think they are too good to fill in at lesser positions.) We took a seat in the bar area. Our server came by fairly quickly, and though she seemed frazzled and scatter-brained, she was also pleasant. We ordered two cocktails. After we did, she made an odd little comment. ""I'll probably end up making them,"" she said. But we didn't pay much attention to that. Then we waited. And waited. No drinks. Usually, at this CF, drinks arrive quickly. We could see the bartender behind the bar. A white guy with closely cropped hair and a bushy beard. But he wasn't making drinks. He was rummaging around under the bar, over and over again. So, there Sweetie and I were, talking. Music was playing quite loudly. We were sitting as far from the bar itself as possible (on the south side), when, through the noise and distance and over our conversation, we heard the bartender loudly say, ""F**k this s**t.""  Wow, okay. The table next to us, containing about 12 Muslim women and little girls in hijabs, all stopped talking and turned to look. The bartender was crashing and banging things behind the bar, pulling things out from underneath, slamming them around. Nice. Then, again very loudly, he said, ""F**k happy hour."" Even nicer. And he just kept rattling and slamming and banging things.  Needless to say, the entire atmosphere was very unpleasant at that point. Not a nice relaxing Friday anymore. Finally, we could see the bartender making our drinks. But he was clearly royally pissed off, making the drinks with no care. That became even clearer when the drinks arrived. The mint leaves in my mojito hadn't been muddled, just thrown in as an afterthought, so the resulting concoction had no mint flavor. The entire drink tasted like nothing but simple syrup- extremely sweet with no flavor of any kind. I tried muddling the mint with my straw, but that didn't help much. I've never sent back a drink before, anywhere, but I sent this one back. We had already ordered food. When it arrived, we ate a little of it, but soon had the rest packaged to go. We just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. We paid and scurried away, glad to be the f**k away from there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=20

If the tables are unstable, shouldn't they be removed immediately?! If 20 min. turned into 1 hour (or even 30-40 min.), shouldn't the manager offer some appetizers for free?

Sally H.,"Aurora, CO",126,102,281,1.0,5/19/2015,"This is my very first one star review.  When I started doing yelp reviews I vowed to myself that I would not rate a business one star.  The reason behind my thinking is I truly believe a bad review hurts a business; that is if the business serves its customers.  The Cheesecake Factory did not even serve my party.   The incidence occur earlier this evening when my family went out in celebration for my niece's graduation.  Since we knew that so many of us were to attend dinner we made a reservation two weeks prior for a large party of 25 at 6pm.  Part of the party arrived tremendously earlier to dinner and others trickled in before the reservation time.  Overall, we were all there before six.  Ten after six, we were told by the manager that they were waiting to set-up our table because the party before us were still lingering around.  We were also given the option to split our group into two for faster service, but we opted out because we wanted to celebrate this special occasion together as a family. Time passed by and we still were not seated.  We asked the front what was going on and was told we did not have a reservation.  We were simply put on the waiting list.  Meaning that we had to wait for the next available seatings.  However, here's the kicker, Cheesecake Factory had called the day before to confirm our reservation.  After the initial explanation of the delay in our table, we sat around for another forty-five minute to be told that we did not have a reservation and we had to wait longer to be seated.  That is simply ridiculous and I felt awful for my niece.  She absolutely loves this place and it was her choice to dine here. Luckily, we called a place near by and they were happy to take all of us in with such short notice.  This location puts a bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=40
Zach B.,"Golden, CO",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Sunday 7/30/17 I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever experienced. After a 40 minute wait, which can be expected on a Sunday, we were buzzed on the clicker to return to the host stand. The hostess told us, as if it was our fault, that our table would be another 10 minutes. This is where we should have gotten the hint for what was in store. We were seated and not greeted for about 10 minutes. We ordered everything on the spot because we had been seated so long already. After 35 minutes our appetizers came. Another 20 minutes passed and our server came out to inform us the kitchen had run out of one of the meals we ordered (55 minutes after ordering). When the food finally arrived at 1hour and 10 minutes after being seated, one of the dishes was a completely different menu item. The worst part, was that the server defended a fried piece of chicken with mashed potatoes as a chicken pasta. Still no offer of a manager. Another 15 minutes passed and the final dish hit the table. After eating, we waited an additional 15 minutes before our server was seen again, who didn't offer us cheesecake at the the Cheesecake Factory. This is the point where I demanded a manager come to our table. Manager did what he could but we will not be returning. Literally wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it.

My food was warm not hot it took a long time for the food to make it to the table.  He was not attentive to the table at all. I could have told him about the food but he was no where to be found by then it was too late I started eating my warm/cold dinner. Which for 19-20 for a pasta it should be spectacular. It seemed as when we did ask the waiter for Something It was as we were bothering him. Also when they(my family) mentioned it was my birthday.

Kaitlin P.,"Louisville, CO",8,4,,1.0,8/31/2015,"This review is exclusive to their catering.  We had a prior catering option fall through the day of  a company lunch that day so I contacted Cheesecake Factory to see if they could help.  While they were able to come through for us last minute, I was not happy with the food brought to us: The person I spoke to that morning made recommendations based on the number of people we have so I ordered food based on those recommendations.  We could've gone with an order 1/2 the size and it still would've been more than enough.  I realize the portion sizes at CF are HUGE, but this was so over the top and it was a big inconvenience on what to do with the food afterwards.  We ordered basic pasta + salads.  The pastas were so over-salted, which prevented people from wanting the second/third helpings that I desperately needed to get rid of.  The salads were fine and of course the bread was amazing (that and the fact that they could help us out last minute are the only reason for the star).

Megan B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",111,7,,3.0,7/5/2015,"Just visited tonight for an early dinner with the family. First, let's state the obvious - this is a huge chain that serves a ton of people, so this is not a gourmet stop. However, there are a couple places where I think CF should get credit. First, this chain is incredibly consistent - hadn't been in years, and never to this location, but I ordered some old favorites and they were just as I remembered. Secondly, for the amount of food you get, the price is really decent.  That said, their food is prepared pretty heavily and can be too rich - I usually opt for a salad for that reason. Their luau salad is my favorite (rec dressing on the side), but I've enjoyed all the ones I've tried. Also, their avocado egg rolls are delicious, no getting around that. Some other favorites I remember are the stuffed chicken tortillas and cashew chicken. Their cheesecake can definitely be too rich/sweet. Tonight we tried the lemon raspberry, which was fairly light and rather tart - a nice change.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, and the service was just fine. All in all, I'd go back again, especially if I needed a larger venue or was with picky eaters - there are so many options!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=40

Ken C.,"Denver, CO",17,18,16,3.0,1/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice option for semi-special occasions, like birthdays, get-togethers, highschool proms, etc. They are extremely popular, can accommodate large parties, and of course have those delicious cheesecakes.  But apparently being so popular doesn't mean the restaurant can handle the strain. We came on a Friday night, which was understandably busy. We were given a wait time of 15-20 minutes, but ended up waiting 30 with nary an apology. Okay, aggravating but no big deal.  Until we waited another 10 minutes before being greeted by our server. I noticed he had been triple seated so not his fault. He was brisk, efficient, and polite but so noticeably strained that I felt rushed for my order and fearful for his throbbing forehead vein.  The rest of the dinner was prolonged between each step with drinks, the meals coming out, and the check being settled. Our server did all he could, but I felt pretty bad for him.  Cheesecake Factory has a great set-up to be a default restaurant. The vast menu, fair prices, huge portions, and gimmicky dessert  shtick is a good formula to people please and make the restaurant an easy choice when the question is, ""Where do we want to go to celebrate something but don't want to look up a new place?"" Easy recipe for popularity.   But a corporate chain restaurant should have scheduling down pat. The staff seemed to know what they were doing but were hurried and kept looking at us like ""where did all these customers come from??"" Overstretched and it was obvious.

Andrew P.,"Oxnard, CA",3,12,12,1.0,11/5/2014,"WORST SERVICE SINCE MOVING TO COLORADO Went here a week ago. I would love to list the pros. But I have none. So here are the cons.  #1 Arrived, the hostess didnt even greet us. We had to get her attention. She looked like she just rolled out of bed. Wearing dirty black leggings, a spaghetti strap shirt with her bra strap exposed, two different colored socks (pink and blue WTF?), and casual sneakers. Is there even a dress code here? #2 Asked for a booth and was looked at like it could not be done then after insisting she the hostess sighed and sat us there.  #3 Waited over 10 minutes just to see our server. Ordered everything at once to make things quicker. Wings, Salmon, and A burger Medium. Wings took 30 minutes just to arrive. #4 Food arrived 30 minutes after the wings. The medium burger was well done. After i cut it open to show the server it was completely over cooked. He said, ""That looks pretty medium."" (Are you kidding me? You say you are sorry for the mistake, take the food away, and make sure you get it re fired.)  #5  Instead of getting to it. He sets the burger down next to the POS and decides not to re ring it but to go to another booth and talk to another guest for 8 minutes. I was dumbfounded. I finally had to tell him to re fire it and put it in a box to go.  It came out 15 to 20 minutes later and the whole time we were never approached by the server or the manager about the issue. It took us over an hour and a half to get our food and for one of us to have our meal. A ticket time for lunch should only be from 12 to 14 minutes. Its just so odd. It seems like the place was being run by people who were there to just collect a check and go home. No passion, no desire to show their guests a good time. Nothing. Needless to say we will not be going back there. I can only hope this keeps some people from experiencing what we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=40

Immanuel D.,"Boulder, CO",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2015,"This is by far one of the worst places in Boulder to eat. First and foremost, the servers here are racist. This isn't just speculation, I heard this from a 4-5 people who work there. They would constantly make fun of different races and say certain races of people didn't tip them well. Such as, ""black and Mexican people never leave good tips."" Mind you the servers here can make $300 dollars a night, but they STILL complain. After knowing the people who work here, do yourself a favor and never eat here. These people don't deserve your money. The male servers are also incredibly sexist and are the type of people to spit in your food. This is not a good place to take your family. Plus, there's so many local businesses in Boulder that really go for quality. This place is just a crappy chain that banks off ignorance of people coming to Boulder who don't know any better places to eat. Oh, and if you go for the cheesecake, remember NONE of the cheesecake is made at the restaurant, they ship it all in FROZEN. If the cheesecake is your favorite, get a slice at take-out without tipping.

I thought it was a little odd there wasn't a wait on a Friday night, now I know why.  I ordered a Caesar salad which was too notch and not overloaded with dressing. My main course was the garlic noodles with shrimp.... Paying $18 a plate there was no flavor not could I taste the garlic in the dish and the shrimp was over cooked to the point it wasn't chewable. I haven't ordered this dish before but I'll stick with their appetizers from now on.  My bf had a simple pepperoni pizza.... When it came out to the table the dough wasn't cooked all the way. There was grease dripping off the pizza like it was from a New York dive pizzeria. He had them take it back and they were very nice about the situation as they took the pizza off the menu and gave him a piece of cheesecake on the house.

I had the tomato basil pasta which was delicious. It had chunks of mozzarella and tomatoes accompanied by grilled chicken and a pesto drizzle. To die for!! However, my fantastic meal was the only good part. When I walked in the door I was greeted by a hostess who told me there would be a 10 minute wait. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our table. When I asked the hostess if she could give me another estimate she simply said ""another 10 minutes"", which she had said 45 minutes ago. Not appreciated. I don't have a problem waiting for my table, but don't tell me 10 minutes is the wait when I have to wait almost an hour... And then when I confronted the hostess about her lack of honesty towards me she rolled her eyes at me and was very rude. It was quite unprofessional to say the least. Needless to say I won't be going back for awhile. I'm very disappointed. My meal would've been that much better if the service had been up to par as well.

Ian M.,"Boulder, CO",0,23,,1.0,2/5/2015,"This place is the worst. I keep coming back, though, because my mom sends my girlfriend and I gift cards to it on almost every holiday. In total, we have probably been to this location around 10 times in 5 years and each time was a negative experience. The funny thing is that my mom began giving us gift cards to Cheesecake Factory long before we lived in Boulder, so I truly do feel like these problems are unique to this location.  We went last night and our main objective was to play it safe. In other words, we decided against looking at the massive menu and ordering what we thought sounded good and instead ordered based on what we thought the kitchen could make successfully. I got a crispy chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got chicken alfredo. The chicken on my sandwich was over cooked and completely dry. The real disaster, though, was my girlfriend's dinner. We had planned on sharing dinners with each other by swapping our plates back and forth across the table. Her plate came out so hot that after waiting for it to cool down she finally just gave up on it ever cooling down and gave me a bite on a fork -- it was terrible! Literally, it tasted nothing like alfredo, only garlic and mush. Obviously the reason the plate was so hot was that it had been microwaved. Really? Almost $20 for a chicken breast, noodles, and sauce and you guys can't make it fresh? It's worth mentioning that my favorite thing at Burger King used to be a Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which they removed from their menu many years ago. It cost about 1/4 what I paid for my dinner last night and I actually mentioned during dinner that BK made better chicken sandwiches.   We are the kind of people that never complain at restaurants. I sat there and ate my chewy chicken sandwich and told the waiter it was fine. My girlfriend decided she had to say something about her dinner. She did and they brought her a complimentary piece of cheese cake. I guess that a $6 piece of cheese cake makes up for an inedible $20 dinner?

Upon entering this establishment we were greeted with great disdain from a staff of pompous self-centered hipster wannabees.  Every service employee we dealt with acted like it was a displeasure for them to even acknowledge our presence let alone converse with us enough to serve us. Not being regulars we had some questions about the long list of cheese cake options.  The person taking care of us (or actually the person avoiding taking care of us) acted like it was our fault that we did not know everything on the menu.  After a couple of questions he rolled his eyes at my sister and started talking to a coworker about some party they were going to later. That was just the tip of the ice berg so to say.  We found no one there to be friendly, helpful, knowledgeable or efficient. The extremely poor service would have been tolerable even the desserts lived up to the expectations alluded to by the name.  Alas the food was more of a letdown then the service was. Most of the cheese cake came out frozen.  Instead of remedying the situation the server told us to just let the cakes warm up over time.  Not the right answer by the way.  The cheese cake that was not frozen was mediocre at best and no worse than most chain restaurant cheese cakes.  Definitely they are not worth the $8 - $10 price tag when other places sell a better product for around five bucks.   But the biggest problem that I had was as follows.  I asked for a New York style cheese cake with no toppings.  The server said to get the original.  I asked if this was a true New York style and not a key lime or lemon type.  He looked at me funny and assured me that it was.  I asked again if it was firm and sugary as apposed to fluffy tart cake.  With a huff, he again said that it was a New York style cake  When the cake came it was definitely not a New York style and tart enough to make me pucker.  When I pointed this failing out to the server he said that it was too late to do anything as I had already taken a bite out of it. He also said that I would know what not to get next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=60

(Instead of getting our drink order) walks by her other table takes their order, puts it in, walks away decides to bus some other tables, disappears in the back for an additional 7-10 minutes then comes back and tells us that someone else will our server. Clearly she didn't want to be there and managed to get cut and wanted nothing to do with her tables or customer satisfaction. I'm a hospitality manager and understand the way things go in restaurants but I figured going to a corporate restaurant with a good reputation it would be a guaranteed good time. I was so upset by the treatment that we left after drinks and apps. We had two appetizers and two drinks and our total was 72$. Kinda crazy. We left hungry, sober and upset. Never returning.

Last night was off-the-charts amazing! The wait was quoted as ""30-35 minutes,"" but was actually more like 15. We got a great table in a quiet area. Our server was on point from start to finish. I was a server for 10 years and know what a challenge Saturday nights can be, but Gretchen K was about as good as it gets. Everything was delivered super fast and had some really nice special touches that are really appreciated, (like boxing up our leftover guacamole and labeling the box with the date- small thing, yes, but a really nice touch).  The food was perfect. My husband had the cajun chicken, which was the perfect temperature, looked amazing, and had the most phenomenal breading ever. I got the filet mignon and it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Dessert was key lime cheesecake- also perfect, and delivered with a Happy Birthday message on a cute little bed of rainbow sprinkles. Small touches make a big difference! Gretchen, if you or your bosses read this, know that we may get one or two date nights a YEAR, and this was definitely worth the wait!

And yet, we're still regulars here because: 1) We only come in for apps and/or cheesecake.  Occasionally we'll get a real meal, but that's only when we're with a big group that really wants to eat there and we still usually just split the Thai lettuce wraps.  2) If the wait is over 15-20 minutes, we skip it.  Since service is slow, we also don't go if we have a strict deadline (trying to make a show within the hour, etc). 3) Smile and be extra friendly to your waiter, and I guarantee you'll get better service.

Debbie R.,"Boulder, CO",19,20,,3.0,8/29/2011,"Basically the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one, you might as well have been to them all. The food is usually good but 'commercial' tasting (think Applebee's, Chili's, Friday's et al) - really nothing special. The menu is HUGE with a ton of delicious sounding options (their marketing team is genius). It's so big that they even have ads in it (slightly weird to me).  Their portions are far too big and I've found most don't reheat well the next day (this is when you'll discover just how oil-laden the food is) so it feels a bit wasteful and expensive (the price appears appropriate for the portions but if you can't consume it all then it's a little expensive - I'd rather they give me less and charge less).  There's usually a wait even when you're looking at empty tables and it seems to take longer than it should for food to hit the table. If you get the bread and butter, understand that the butter is usually cold (pet peeve). It's a decent place to eat as long as you understand what you're getting. Now, their cheesecake is delectable and you'll find options you couldn't have even imagined. Just don't plan to have cheesecake after eating dinner there as you'll be too full.  My favorite time to go is after have a late-ish, large-ish lunch somewhere else then just stopping in cheesecake factory for dessert (in lieu of dinner).

So this rating ranting and the review has nothing to do with this being a chain restaurant. that cleared, lets get going. The food is ok at this place. Not spectacular, but kind of, I can eat it on one of those days. But I can not say the same about the service. On the earlier two occasions, I found the service lacking, but last night it just went all the way to a million minus stars and more! They do not take reservations on a Saturday night. Okay!! so we went and submitted our group name and waited 45 minutes for our table. after we are merrily seated, we order our wines, cocktails and other drinks and the apps. so far so good. And we have a lady wait staff for our table. she comes out with water for everyone and wants us to move our hands, limbs and whatever else we can from the table because she ""is not strong enough to hold that weight""  and wants to put the tray on the table! If I was the server, I would make 2 or 10 trips back to the kitchen and move fast on my feet ! It would not have been a big deal if the rest of the meal had gone well! since that did not happen - it IS a big deal!! you would expect a wait staff member to know how to open a bottle of wine! wouldn't you ? Oh no! she comes with the bottle of wine and says, ooh I am sorry I don't know how to open the bottle !!! WHAT! Remember my peace loving hubbz? he patiently explained the process to her. No luck! she did not understand. so he demonstrated the method to her. All this while I kept thinking, she should have asked for help from another staff member.  Anyhow, she happily lets my hubbz open the bottle and then serves the wine. And we wait for the appetizers and the rest of the drinks  and food.  I can really write a tale of woes on this but the long and short of it was that none of the food we ordered came on time, she entirely missed an order of appetizers and never ever bothered to check on us. One of our friends ordered scotch on the rocks, which came in a funny and cheap looking glass. I have never ever seen scotch served like that. It was hilarious and insulting at the same time. The icing in their 'serving  cheesecake ' - they served wrong entree to one of our friends - not once, but twice. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for them to get the  entree she ordered . Which was after their serving/kitchen staff kept on almost throwing the plates on our table because they were hot.

Kasey H.,"Spokane, WA",0,8,,1.0,8/6/2012,"Went here on 8/3/12 while vacationing in Colorado with my boyrfriend. We had already had dinner & walked the strip mall on Pearl, & dropped into the Cheesecake Factory for dessert. We're from the Eastern part of Washington state, so we've never been to one before. The service was fine, but by the time the check came, we were astounded. Expected about a $20-30 tab, & the total came to $43.99!  The breakdown of the check was as follows: One strawberry lemon drop for $11,50 (I've never paid that much for a mixed drink before in my life, even in the ritziest places; plus it tasted horrible, & was less than half the size of the Long Island), one Long Island Iced Tea for $9.25, one Reese's peanut butter cheesecake for $8, one peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for $7, & ala mode (ice cream) for $5. The ice cream, instead of being a $2 add-on for my boyrfriend's plate, came in a separate bowl with 2 piddly scoops of ice cream that would barely be larger than a teaspoon each.  My boyfriend could have sworn the menu said his drink was $6.75, which was why he ordered it, but when I asked the waitress, she brought back the menu to show us, & it was a different menu than we had ordered from (we had the full menu, which included drinks; she brought us a separate drink menu only). I resigned myself to the horrific bill & we paid it, but I made the check out for $46 even, with a $2.01 tip. I realize now that it may seem contentious to sign a bill with a 2.01 tip, but at the time, I was only thinking of making the amount a whole number, & yes, I wasn't going to tip overabundantly for an outrageous bill. When I checked my bank account today, now that I'm home, I found that they charged me $47! It isn't the extra dollar that pisses me off; it's the general experience altogether. I thought for a moment that they may have misunderstood my writing, but I write very clearly & it would be difficult to interpret a ""2"" as a ""3"" in the tip, & even more so to see a ""7"" instead of a ""6"" on the total. This has happened to me before, though, at other restaurants where I was slighted, & I think wait staff will do this since most people won't contest a dollar overcharge. In addition to the bill fiasco, my boyfriend & I chose to dine outside, since the weather was so nice. About 5 feet out from the outdoor seating fence, was a pair of facing benches, on which a group of about 5-10 hippies lounged with their dog. Apart from the overly loud conversation they were having about not working for ""the man"" & the politics of the world, when one of the tables near us vacated, one of the women snuck over to the fence, vaulted over barefoot (I'm not a prejudiced person in general, but this girl reeked like she hadn't showered in months), & grabbed the plate of leftover food the customers had left. She vaulted back over the fence & proceeded to eat it by hand with her fellows. The part that almost made me lose my stomach, though, was that the dog was one of her ""fellows"", & they were letting the dog get up & lick the plate & food in the same places they proceeded to lick it from. It was not an enjoyable experience, & what surprised me more was that none of the wait staff said anything to them, giving me the impression that my food was likely to be ripped off the table at any moment.  The only decent things to relate: they are open late, which is nice. The waitress, before the bill came, was friendly, & the cheesecake was awesome, though expensive. Despite that, we both plan on being back in the area in the next few months, & suffice it to say, never plan on dining there again. We felt completely misled & walked out of there feeling robbed. Although on this trip the per-person fare was less than $61, we realized that if we had dined there & had dessert, plus drinks, it would have been well over that amount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=100

It takes about 20 minutes to decided what the hell to order.  We arrived STARVING! Bread and butter were yummy and so were our drinks. For the appetizer, we ordered shrimp tempura. Super good and crunchy. Loved the green onions they place on top and the tipping sauce complemented the shrimp.  For dinner I ordered their chicken carbonara. Loved the creaminess and bacon bites in the dish. I thought they did an excellent job of making it - one of the best I have had. They brought my hubby's shrimp pasta jambalaya half ways through my meal. The waitress said that there were too many jambalaya ordered that the cook missed one and it happened to be my husbands.

Noelle B.,"Boulder, CO",8,113,1,3.0,3/14/2010,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in both Chicago and Denver.  It was several years ago and I remember the place being fancy and delicious.  I didn't get the same experience last night at the Boulder Cheesecake Factory. First, I think the menu is ridiculously long.  I'm sure the menu has always been that long but it was insane. Next, the bread was disappointing.  It was very cold and was served with packets of butter you'd find in a diner.  I expected more from the Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend and I both had burgers.  That's why I bumped my review up to three stars.  The food was good.  It wasn't anything truly amazing but I did like the different types of burgers they served.  It was very creative.   Fortunately the Cheesecake was spectacular.  We had a plain cheesecake with fresh strawberries and it didn't disappoint.  At least CF is still serving their signature dish just right. Two more things.  One, we were disappointed in the glassware.  We were served our water in plastic mugs that you may find at Chili's.  They were cloudy with use.  We thought a place that touts itself to be 'classy' would at least serve us water in glasses. And two, the music was TERRIBLE.  We heard everything from Kelly Clarkson to Janet Jackson to some rock music and then easy listening.  The music was loud and didn't quite fit the ambiance of any restaurant.  Something low and mellow would have been much better. My experience there felt very much like I was at a chain restaurant.  I know CF is a chain, but in the past it's never felt like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=100

John C.,"Boulder, CO",1,7,,5.0,12/14/2009,"OK people, how can you give this place a bad review? If you're a chain-hater, kindly recuse yourself and refrain from writing a bad review just out of principle. This restaurant should be judged for what it is, a casual restaurant that offers tasty food at a reasonable (but ot cheap) price in a timely manner. Let me tell you my credentials first. I've been to this place at least 200 times over the last several years. Sure, every experience wasn't perfect, but I can say with high statistical reliability that the service is good 95% of the time. Without going to a 4 or 5 star restaurant, you just don't get that kind of reliability anywhere else. I will say that during the evening hours on peak dining out days, the service gets strained by the sheer volume of traffic they handle. I usually take a late lunch during the week or midday on a weekend. Some of my favorite food choices are the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. That is some serious chomp! Oh, and the Miso Salmon is to die for. Not just to die for, it's to kill for. the Navajo Sandwich is a tasy lunch treat; try it with cooked carrots instead of the fries for a more healthy version. I really can't remember the last time I ordered something I didn't like there. I seem to remember some sort of Asian dish that had too much sauce... The portions are ridiculously huge. My biggest challenge is getting out of there without feeling like a whale. An appetizer will do fine if you're not that hungry. Otherwise, force yourself to take some home with you.  Besides a bewildering array of cheesecakes, they have other scrumptious desserts. Chris' Outrageous Cake is, well, outrageously delicious. Prices are not cheap. $7 for a slice of cheesecake, for example. However, I am willing to pay extra for consistently good service and food that is consistently delicious. And you will never be hungry an hour later, unless you are half grizzly bear and are nearing hibernation time. I'm a booth man, and this place is loaded with booths. Big ones, little ones, medium ones. Oh, and did I mention the restrooms are clean and nice, with those fancy automatic faucets and extra high privacy walls between the urinals?

I used to think this place was incredible; now I feel that it's typical, sub-par and overwhelmingly chicken-oriented.  The ads in their menu makes the place appear as a sell-out--why am I interested in jewelry when I'm supposed to be choosing a meal from your rediculous 20-page menu?  The waitstaff mingle in small groups between serving and occasionally look over your shoulder (a little too frequently) while gossiping about the latest staff-related drama.  Save it for the kitchen.  I ordered teriyaki chicken; the skin was rubbery and the chicken was wierdly shaped--didn't know chicken breast grew with two drumbstick bones sitcking out on either side.  Luckily (sorta...) the rice was swimming in teriyaki sauce (the best part of my meal) so that moistened the meat a bit.  I felt ill the rest of the night. The other people in my party didn't rave about their food either. It all seemed very typical with little creative flair--proof that the chefs are trained to crank out the hundreds of dishes on the menu all day and with little enthusiasm.  Definitely speaks to the ""Factory"" aspect of the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boulder?start=100

At a cost of $200 for the nite, I felt we deserved some effort.  The food here was good but overpriced. It was not nearly as good as the Park Meadows location and I admit I had second thoughts on my choice after our meal was served. I tried the new black bean burger that took the place of my favorite portobello sandwich and not impressed. I would prefer smaller portions on most items and lower prices so that I could enjoy a meal plus the tasty desserts.  As always the expansive menu can be overwhelming.  Cheesecake is always excellent. Would I go here again, probably not. Parking was down the street in garage and managers did not comp parking tickets like in downtown Denver so that was additional expense for all of us.

It's like a short novel of sub-par food. Now that I've been there a couple times, I feel wrong every time I order something, because I haven't even read the other half of the menu. Plus, it's filled with advertisements! An ad for Bob the plumber is the last thing I want to look at when I'm ordering my food. It's cluttered and annoying. When the food does come, I won't lie, it isn't terrible. It's just so overwhelmingly mediocre. The plates are plain (I usually like a good looking plate of food) and most of the food is deep fried. I usually leave satisfied, but with a stomach ache. I try to order the cheesecake every time I go because that is, after all, the point of the place. It's alright.

My son stared at my wife and I in disbelief , wondering who had invaded our shells - we wanted to go try the Cheesecake Factory.  The ethnic, local, organic, mom and pop, crew was going corporate.   I went with an open mind and was surprised by my experience.  Greeted by a team 5+ bubbly teens who quickly and efficiently seated us in a window booth that proved to be quite and comfortable. Down side was the kiddy mess smashed into the window from the prior party. Waitress was quick with water, (2 no ice - one with with out batting an eye)  specials of the night and our drink order (local fix of  Fat Tire).  Our initial drink order was accompanied by the prompt reply of ""Noooo Problem"" our first of night of her seemly universal response to any request , order or question.   But I got used to it  ""Nooo Problem"". With only three people and the knowledge that the portions were huge we ordered three things.  All came out quickly. I put aside my snooty chain predisposition and realized that everything we ordered was great: Tuna Salad Tataki - Very rare seared tuna with lettuce, big beefsteak tomatoes (ripe mid-winter after a blizzard of 06), and avocado in a light Asian dressing.   Ranch burger - Big - bigger than big - giant.  Cooked med-rare. Great flavor texture with thick crispy bacon, mushrooms, and cheese.  The portion of fries seemed diminutive compared to the burger. Chicken wraps - Grilled chicken, beautiful bib lettuce, grated carrot and marinated cucumber, and noodles.  Three sauces for dipping each rated very good compared with other ""real"" Asian restaurants.

Neil A.,"Broomfield, CO",0,41,,4.0,3/12/2011,"If my most recent visit had been my first to this location, I would have given it only 3 stars. However, on the strength of earlier experience with this and other locations, I am holding the line at 4. Obviously, this place can be a characature of itself, with the monstrous portions and epic broad-ranging menu. Still, I don't think it's fair to just look at that and dismiss it out-of-hand. If you get something that reheats well, the value is very good as you can often get 2-3 meals out of one visit. With the size of the menu, not everything is going to be great, but there are some nice dishes to be found amongst all of that. The latest experience was a bit of an adventure. The 2-year old had 45 minutes of running around outside during the wait and was a bit hyper (chucked a plate onto the floor, breaking it). After we ordered entrees, another server came up with a couple of random plates of food, thinking they were for us. A couple of minutes later, the actual entrees came, but the server had mistook my order, so I had a while to watch my wife eat before they finally got my order (shepherd's pie) correct. I've had it before here, and generally like the dish. It was fine this time, but not as good as I've had other times here.  When we got to dessert, it got really interesting. While we figured out cheesecake for ourselves, we ordered sliced strawberries for the little one. That took about 15 minutes(!) to come out, and the cheesecake we ordered took at least another 15 minutes. The waiter was very apologetic, saying that the bakery was backed up and that they had some new people up there so things weren't going great. I'm generally pretty forgiving about these things, but it is hard for me to imagine a job requiring much less skill than what we needed from the bakery: 1) Slice strawberries in half (if they aren't presliced), toss them on a plate and put some whipped cream 2) Slice a premade cheesecake (which is probably also presliced), toss it on a plate and put some whipped cream 3) There is no 3 - you are done! What did you think, you're cooking a risotto or a filet mignon or something? Very odd. Anyway, the waiter was very apologetic, but didn't choose to do even a slight bill adjustment after all the screw-ups.

I thought all locations served the same portions because they do the same menu; but today the appetizers we normally got in Vegas were HALF the size for the same price.
