10,Austin T.,"Lincoln, NE",15,3,,1.0,2012-08-25,"I would never think to give any Applebee's less than 3 stars. Unfortunately, tonight's experience changed my mind. A couple of us went in about 10:15PM, and on a Saturday, I was surprised at how slow it was. We were one of maybe 10 tables in the whole restaurant.  First sitting down, I noticed the manager, JR I believe, sit down on his break at the bar to eat. Not a problem, he probably had a rough day and deserved it. I am all about breaks. I know for a fact I made eye contact with him when he sat down. That made me think that as a manager, he would be personable, he didn't get hired to not talk to people. in the hour we were there, he greeted 4 other tables that came upwards to 45 minutes after we did. We were not greeted once by him. At my job, and as a cook, I even check up on customers. It's the one thing that made this experience so bad. After neither server (Leslie and Kevin) knew exactly who was going to be our server, I knew it was going to be a rough experience. I will admit, we did take time to order, and the server(s) were pretty persistent about making sure if we were ready, but for an order of wings and one burger, I would not expect the 20 minute wait we had for our food.  Especially when my wings were warm at most. After all being said and done, I use to love this location, but now, I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
12,Michelle S.,"Waverly, NE",0,1,,1.0,2012-10-21,"Went in on a saturday night and was TOTALLY disappointed.  Used to go on fridays but since they added karaoke and its so loud we switched.  They've added some sort of jukebox and the music was horrible and at full volume,  It was what I'd expect from a club, not a restaurant.  We were seated and told that our server would be kevin, but fifteen minutes passed and he never showed up.  We asked a passing server if we could order and she sent someone over to take our drink orders.  When I tried to order a beer she told me that legally she wasn't allowed, but could offer us some water.  We got up and went to cheddar's.  We used to go every saturday after work, but we'll never be back. Can the teenager BS and go back to being a family place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
11,Steve B.,"Lincoln, NE",0,19,,3.0,2013-09-16,"Not bad restaurant. I won't say great good, but not worst though. Going one  time o.k. to this place. I went with my friends today for lunch and got this experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
9,Chad W.,"Leonardville, KS",0,4,,5.0,2014-02-03,Rolled into Applebees after the camper show. Git seated right away. All the t.v.'s had college basketball on.....Sweet. Waitress came right over took our drink order. I had a dirty martini....when it came back to our table a small hair was floating in it. Of course I was shocked but got it out and met the waitress know. She said I'm sorry....very sweet woman. A few minutes later the mgr came over and comped the drink. He apologized and said its unacceptable. The food was amazing. We all left with smiles and a new camper. Great Day!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
8,Alex L.,"Lincoln, NE",0,1,,1.0,2014-02-20,"Food and service get worse with every visit. Riblets were very tough, could not finish them and left still hungry. My wife had the garlic mashed potatoes for her side, they were more like a potato puree and very tasteless. She asked for a different side which didn't make it to the table until we were almost finished. We were never asked how food or service was. Will never go to an Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,

6,Ben B.,"Lincoln, NE",0,3,,1.0,2014-06-12,This place is awful! Unorganized and very dirty. Management refused to fix problems with order and was very rude. Service was extremely slow as well. Most Applebee's are great this one flunked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
5,Andrew B.,"Lincoln, NE",0,1,9.0,3.0,2014-07-01,"This review isn't rating the store as a whole. But more so the service that was dealt to me, and that I observed from the other interactions I saw from the same server. My waitress/bartender was: Amelia. Right from The get go she was not happy to be here. At all. No smile, how are you, greeting, nothing. Then continued to be very distant, and not out going at all. I have ran and operated restaurants before, and she was nothing to what the standards for a bartender and/or waitress should be. No smile, mean looks, just didn't look like she wanted to be here. Very disappointed in the service that was given by her. On the other hand, Katie, who took over at the bar, was welcoming, smiled, introduced her self, and just had the energy of a server that I would want at my restaurant. Thanks to Katie, my business was kept at Applebee's. Food was great, and my drink stayed full the whole time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
4,Ashley M.,"Lincoln, NE",35,15,7.0,1.0,2015-04-26,"By far the worst Applebee's I've been to. You expect to see some area's of improvement in any restaurant, especially the chain restaurants, but we waited about an hour and 15 minutes between ordering and getting our food. Most of the food was cold, the apples my daughter ordered looked old, and her yogurt was spoiled and had a spot of mold in it. The waitress did ZERO to fix any of it. Horrible...just horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
3,Tom L.,"Papillion, NE",0,6,,4.0,2016-03-23,Stopped by Monday evenight for the All In Burger Specials...   I had the burger with the fried egg and my spouse had the triple bacon burger with sweet potato fries.  I had the homemade house chips.  Everything was fantastic.  Service was quick and friendly.  Wonderful visit.  Especially with the Monday night burger special prices.  STILL OUR FAVORITE FOR A QUICK BITE!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
2,Steve L.,"Lincoln, NE",11,9,3.0,1.0,2016-12-11,"Had an unfortunate experience our first time here. They were out of stock of some food items we ordered, service was slow, and a friend ended up getting sick shortly after finishing the meal. They had good drink specials that evening though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
1,Jason Z.,"Lincoln, NE",17,86,83.0,2.0,2017-03-15,"It's an Applebee's in a mall, so it's exactly as I expected for lunch.  It was deserted for lunch.  The soup tasted like canned and the Chicken Cavatappi had three small cuts of  semi-charred chicken on top of dry pasta that was on top of the sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  Like I said, I wasn't expecting five stars, it met the always low expectations for an Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
0,Jenni W.,"Lincoln, NE",52,4,,3.0,2017-07-22,Service is extremely slow. We came in on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't busy at all but we had to wait several minutes at the front to even have someone acknowledge us to get us a table. Our server was very friendly but slow. Once we finished our meal it took forever to come back and take our payment so we could leave. The food was great but service was lacking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lincoln-10,,,,,
