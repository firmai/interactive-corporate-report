After we were seated, at a wet table with crumbs in the chairs, our menus were dropped on the table and she walked away. The waiter was a breath of fresh air! He was very polite and accommodating! We ordered the drink special only to get 2 glasses with lemon juice(margaritas)and one with Sprite (Long Island Iced tea) for $3. We immediately called over the waiter who recommended the ultimates(more expensive versions). When these drinks came they were the exact same thing just bigger glasses.

128,Tonette V.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,23,,4.0,2014-01-21,"One good review, one poor review.  The issue here is that everything depends on your server. Went there 3 weeks ago.  Had a wonderful server named (I think) Emirror.  She was above and beyond spectacular.  That day, I found out that as a Stripes member, I was supposed to get free chips and salsa with every visit.  As many times as I had been to this place, no one ever told me that.  She did not hover over us, but she made sure that everything we ordered was there in a timely manner, hot, refilled my coffee quickly, told us what our menu choices came with.  She was on the ball.  She did not fuss when I showed her my coupon for a free entree.  She was amazing.  Of course, I gave her a 35% tip.  Wish I had more cash on me to give her. Sadly, 2 weeks ago, I was there and had a different server because Emirror was not on duty that day.  The service was horrible.  Took 20 minutes before I even met my server, another 15 minutes before she took the drink and appetizer order.  I had to remind her about the free chips and salsa.  Took another 25 minutes before we got the appetizer and drinks.  Mine was a decaf coffee.  She wasn't sure if it was decaf or not.  Took so long for her to find out that the coffee got very cold.  When she did return, her attitude was worse.  I glanced at my watch because I had another engagement.  She looked down at me and said ""I'm very busy today.  I have this entire side.""  OK.  #1, that's not my problem.  #2, there were only 2 other tables on that side, and they had both come in after me and been served their food before me.  And #3, how dare you act as though your poor service is my concern!  The customers who had just come in overheard her comments and asked to be moved to a different server! By the time our entree was served, we had been there over an hour, and the order was not complete.  We had to ask for items piece by piece, even though they were in the original order.  The food was cold.  By the time she came with the bill, I already had my credit card and stripes card in my hand with my coat on.  She dropped the bill and walked away, mumbling under her breath something about being busy.  She did not return for 20 minutes.  I was already standing to leave.  I left her a 8% tip.  I shouldn't have left anything.  I know we all have bad days, but customers should never have to suffer at the hands of a poor server.   Bottom line, when you go to TGIF, if your service is poor, let the manager know.  The manager had stepped out before I left or he/she would have heard from me.  And don't be afraid to ask to be moved to a better table.  Some of the servers are superb and some are horrible. Fortunately, the food is very good and the price is decent.  When I go back, I will call ahead to make sure the server I had 3 weeks ago is there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=160,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998

It's affordable, nearby and the food is usually your typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. He is a meat & potatoes kind of guy so he always orders the Turkey burger with french fries. But during one if our most recent visits he was in the mood for steak. Thus, he ordered the flat iron steak w/ fries. The steak they brought out was extremely small so he sent it back to the kitchen. The waitress explained that it was the cut of steak that he chose. (Little did we know) and happily spoke to her manager about a new order.  About half an hr later the manager himself brought a new steak which was a more appropriate size and he enjoyed every bit of it. I was in the mood for a burger (extremely rare) much to my surprise they were out of burger buns. Just great. What kind of burger joint runs out of burger buns!?? The waitress told me they can substitute w/ a child's bun or slice of bread instead or suggested i change my order. I chose the latter. I then ordered the pan-seared chicken hibachi w/ pita bread & vegetable melody. Had it before and it was on point. The service however was slow, we had no silverware, no burger buns & it took  20 minutes for them to bring our check. Maybe it was an off night but this is not our regular location.

Our waitress took our drink orders and returned 10 minutes later without our drinks to take our lunch order. Low and behold, 15 minutes later our drinks came. Our appetizers arrived shortly after. Then we sat and waited for our food for over an hour from the time we sat down. When it did finally arrive, the order was wrong and the waitress didn't know it for another 30 minutes. Thats how long it took for her to check on us to see if the order was even correct. I was fed up at that point because she took our glasses to refill the drinks and didn't return until I had another waitress summon her. Two people at our table had nothing to drink for nearly 30 minutes. I made her aware of the missing order by Another waitress  passing by and she said she must have entered it wrong (really?). She said she would fix it. While waiting I saw a couple sitting waiting to be serviced and left after sitting there for 20 minutes without a waitress ever approaching them..hmm bad service I take it. We were ready to go after being there for 1 hour and 45 minutes, but it took this waitress another 20 minutes to get our check.  The food was actually pretty good when we finally received it.

We gave her our drink orders and 15 minutes later, after she finished chatting and laughing with her co-workers, we got our drinks, half full cosmos. She handed us our drinks and walked away, no mention of taking a food order. While we were sitting there amazed at the lack of service, another bar patron was also complaining. We decided to leave after another 20 minutes passed without so much of a glance in our direction. The service here is horrible.

133,V H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,1.0,2014-08-11,"My husband and I went there yesterday around dinner time.  Firstly, the entire area in front of the bathrooms, right behind the Maitre D stand smells like the bathroom. That should have been warning enough.  Seating for two was quick. Great. We were seated in booth 52, I think it was, in the corner.  We immediately noticed that there was a lot of garbage on the floor in the booth so I pointed it out to the young man who seated us.  As soon as we sat down, our sandals stuck to the floor and my elbows were sticking to the table. We requested that the table be cleaned and it was. I looked at my sandals and there was a paper stuck to it. Then, I started smelling something bad. The floors were sticky and stink!!!!! I told my husband that I could not eat there, but he asked me to be patient. As we were waiting for the waiter, there were workers to our left at a bar style table eating chicken wings out of a styrofoam box, which they left there after eating from it like vultures. I thought that I was on an episode of Undercover Restaurant or some other show.  Our waiter came over, and my husband noticed that he had on bluejeans while others had on all black, well most workers did. We asked him to return because we were not ready. He later returned and I listed our three items from the menu. Then he asks me to repeat it because he was not ready.  Okay, no problem.  Maybe he was new. We can work with you.  So we gave the order.  While he was gone it stench got worse so I went to the Maitre D and asked for another table.  They moved us to another area.  While there my husband began to worry that our food may get some ""special"" love since we had complained about the filth.  I tried to soothe his nerves while we waited for the appetizer.  Then, two female servers came over and asked us who was our server? What!?  I wanted to say, 'Why don't you go find out?' but I was trying to be cool so I just described the guy.  Our server brought the appetizer and my husband was so turned off at this point, as was I, so we asked the server for the check for the appetizer that we had not eaten and for the two drinks that we did not drink and told him we would pay for those and leave. He disappeared for about 5 minutes so we left. No one noticed that we left. No manager ever came out to apologize. This was the worst experience ever!  From what I could see, the majority of the staff is Black, like us, so we were happy to see that, but it was so disappointing. There were groups of servers hanging out in corners while tables were dirty. No one was really checking in on their tables and where the hell was the manager?!!! I would not be surprised if the manager was one of the individuals hanging out.  I really don't even know what to say beyond you all better get it together.  I will never return there again. Buyer beware!!!!  You have no idea who could be sitting in your restaurant. You stand to lose.  What you lost with our business I am sure did not hurt you at all, but in the long run if you this place is not put in order, you will stand to lose more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=160,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.956,2.6

There seems to be absolutely no management going on, and you can tell the wait staff is kind of left to police themselves. Not a good idea when you're hiring young people who could care less about their job. We went late in the evening but considering it was fairly busy they should at least keep the floors clean. There was food spilled all over and no one seemed to mine tracking the smeared food all over the restaurant.

I visited this TGIF after a long day of shopping with my extended family only to receive the worst service in my entire life. Our ""waitress"" JORDAN had to be the worst waitress ever in the history of food services because if there was a competition to see who can be the snottiest and most inattentive to paying customers on purpose; she succeeded!  We arrived. We were seated within 20 minutes. We knew what we wanted. We asked her (Jordan) to please call our waitress because we were ready to order, she says ""it's me, I'll be back"". (STRIKE 1) She comes back in 5 minutes and says while rolling her eyes and in a hasty annoyed tone,  ""I'm Jordan, I'm your waitress, what y'all want to order?"" (Strike 2) We placed our order and at the end I requested a water. Remember this. Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out, and what do you know when they did come out our food was COLD! ( Strike 3) At this point we just started to feel like this girl had a personal agenda for us. She was attentive to everyone else but us.  (Strike 4) At this point she didn't even bother to bring our food to us anymore. We had 4 different people tending to our table. (Strike 5) Remember the water I asked for? Never got it. (Strike 6) Time elapsed, by this point we felt like we were forcing ourselves to eat the appetizers, then our food came. It looked as if they just did a whatever job and it was poorly made. My friend ordered her steak medium rare, she could barely cut through it. Just terrible. (Strike 6) You know how after you get your food, your server is to walk over and ask if you need anything or if everything is okay ? Yeah, NO, not with Jordan as your waitress. Oh wait, remember the infamous water? Yeah, No, still never got it. (Strike 7)  After prolonged disgusting service, we finally called for Lisa; the manager, and had to report the absence of hospitality and customer service in there. She was very apologetic and tried to better the situation. She was someone that did make the situation a little better just by her aura and personality. I'm guessing she spoke to Jordan, and then after that Jordan comes storming over and says to me "" YOU NEED A WATER still?"" Seriously?! I was just TOO THROUGH.  My whole thing is we all have personal issues and most of us are fed up with our jobs, but don't bring your personal issues to work and take it out on others. We ARE paying customers and depending on service GREAT tippers too. I am one that is always willing to pay anyone for a service done for me and for her to treat us that way was very distasteful. I will never go to a TGIFridays again because of this experience. I am so turned off.  Again, this was my worst experience ever. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.

I'm not an avid yelp reviewer nor would I usually care to write a review for a chained restaurant but this place deserved one (a bad one at that).  Started when I went inside - saw a hostess, waiter and I assume a bus boy waiting in front where customers are usually greeted. I said hello then asked for a table/booth for my family and I. Got a weird look from them, where they basically ignored me for a few seconds and proceeded to have a conversation within themselves... and then they finally decided to seat us. Okay.  Sat down at our booth for almost 10 minutes and our waiter finally came. He greeted us, told us about some specials and then said ""ill come back in a few minutes so you can take a look at the menu and put in everything. Drinks, apps, food, etc."" - ?.... Most waiters would usually at least ask what we wanted to drink ASAP but whatever, we told him we knew what we wanted for drinks and apps right then and there. This wasn't a big deal but anyways ... So he comes back, gives us our drinks, walks away and I thought he went to go get my drink but he didn't come back. I saw him taking other customers orders.. That's fine. I sipped on water at the table. When he did finally came back (maybe 10 min later) I told him he forgot my iced tea and he tried to play it off by saying ""oh yeah, the bartenders making it"". what? The bartender making ICED TEA? even if that were true, why did it take so long for it come? *rolls eyes* Continuing ... so apps come and we realize there are no plates. We told our waiter and his reply was ""oh yeah, no problem, those are coming right up"". He clearly didn't care about us because we saw him serving other ppl right after he said that. How long would it have taken for you to grab plates?? By time he did finally come back with those WET plates, the apps were already done. Smh. When the food finally comes, he gives everyone at the table their food except for my sister when he then proceeds to tell her ""oh my fault, I should've known this but we don't have what you ordered. Is there anything else you want?"" What the. You tell her this AFTER you bring out everyone else's food?? Smh.

55,Victoria A.,"Bronx, NY",9,7,,1.0,2015-10-13,"On Monday October 12th, my family and I arrived as a party of 8, and upon arrival I was informed by the host that the wait would be 15 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes, I asked the host how many parties were ahead of us, as we had already waited 10 minutes over our wait time, and there were many empty tables available. I was told that we had 1 party ahead of us. I then witnessed 5 other parties called for their tables. Over 30 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. When I inquired as to why the wait was taking so long, I was basically told that servers were making it difficult to seat tables. When I pointed to empty tables and asked why we could not be seated at them, I was told that the server for that particular area could not have any more parties seated in their section. After about 35 minutes, we were finally seated at a table.  Once seated, we waited for about 10 minutes. I got up and approached the manager asking her why we had not been seen by a server yet, and she said she would send him right over. Once the server arrived, I asked for children's menus, as we had 2 small children in our party. I was told that the restaurant had run out of menus. I asked the server to run down the list of children's menu items since there were no children's menus. Once we put in our orders with the server, about 10 minutes later we received about half of our beverages. I had to request the rest of them, as it appeared they were forgotten about. When ordering our entrees, 3 people in our party ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler, and we were told that the restaurant had run out of shrimp. When we asked if they could accommodate by adding extra baby back ribs to the order, we were told by the manager that additional ribs would be a $7 up charge, however she would only charge $2. I thought it was ridiculous to charge anything, as they were not able to accommodate for the items that come with the order. 3 people in our party ordered the 10 oz steak, which we were told the restaurant had run out of, so they had to get the Flat Iron stead instead. We ordered endless appetizers (boneless buffalo wings and pot stickers). While dining, when we requested to have our order of potstickers replenished, we were told that the restaurant had run out of potstickers. One of the people in our party had ordered root beer with her meal. She informed the manager that the root beer was flat. The manager said she would check the root beer to see if it was flat and if so, bring the person in our party a ginger ale instead. We never received a replacement root beer OR ginger ale. However this was not taken off of the bill until I requested that they do so, as we'd never received it. One person in our party ordered steak fries with his flat-iron steak. They had not been cooked long enough, as the fries were cold on the inside. When we requested steak sauce for the table, we were told that the restaurant had run out of steak sauce. This was disappointing, as 3 people in our party had steak entrees.  I communicated my concerns to the manager, as overall this was a very unpleasant experience for me and my family. I was even more surprised that they restaurant had run out of so many items when it was Monday night, and the restaurant did not have very many patrons. The manager informed me that the restaurant had more patrons than expected for the weekend, and as a result they were not quite prepared. As a patron, this is not really comforting to hear. She was apologetic and did take off 20% from our total bill. In conclusion, my family and I will not likely be returning to this TGI Fridays, nor will we be recommending it to friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=80,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.7000000000000002,1.92

Could barely hear myself think. It's bad enough that the customer noise level is full of uncouth people with no manners for their surrounding diners by shrieking and yelling like they're hanging out on their porch but to compound it with a live sports event (football, in this case) is just not customer friendly or savvy. Messy crumbs on booth seat, ugh. Took 7 minutes from the moment I was seated by the perky and pleasant hostess to have a server introduce herself and offer a drink. Waitress forgot to give me the flavored mayo on the side I requested. **When I requested refills of my fresh brewed iced tea, she kept giving me the same glass. Not a fresh glass. I'm eating a messy burger; it's going to transfer to the glass, no matter how often I wipe my fingers. Having to touch that was creepy and not appetizing.**   Burger was overcooked. I requested medium rare (warm, red center), received barely medium (light pink). Skimpy on the crispy cajun onions. Iceberg lettuce? Really?? In this day and age when Romaine is so easy to procure and provides a better experience. Chipotle mayo and beer cheese coupled with my hunger saved it from being sent back.  Mind you, the burger was tasty. It just wasn't up to snuff with what I'm used to @ TGIF's. Fries were dry and barely warm. Like they had been sitting there. Not fresh.  My server was a sweet gal; friendly, forthcoming with suggestions, quick on the serves and bringing me the check. Let's face it though... It's attached to the Green Acres Mall. They judge their viability according to volume and not individual satisfaction. If you're all scooby with that? Have at it. They lost my business due to inept kitchen staff. I can even forgive the server her faux pas as I attribute it to her young age and the busy hour. The rest is sub par service that I will avoid like the plague. Had to edit this review to update a detail. One of indicators that a chain pays attention to their business is ""the little things"".  Bathroom. I'm not handicapped but use that stall wherever I go because it's roomier and I'm finicky about comfort. This one was set up for family use (fold down diaper table). Said table was stained!!! I don't have children but am horrified on behalf of mothers that would need to use this feature. No paper seat liners!!! It's a handicapped stall. Do the proprietors actually expect a wheelchair bound customer to hover over the bowl?? Not to mention the smell. Granted, the floor was clear of debris but it had that odor that indicated they only cleaned it once a day at beginning of shift and didn't use bleach to disinfect it.

I've been here previously when they were newly renovated and had a good cocktail. The staff here have gotten a lot better with customer service and the menu has improved.  I really dread coming to this mall closer to the end of the week. Crowds by the masses flock to dine at the nearby family chain restaurants and that's not really my flavor. It was Thursday.  Groceries were low and I was much too tired to cook and didn't meal prep so my girlfriend wanted to grab dinner with the kids. She promised that T.G.I.F had cleaned up their act and the menu had new pages and she was right.  It took us at least 20 minutes to decide on our dinner entrees. The new 427 menu features small portion entrees for small prices. It featured my favorite T.G.I.F app the notorious Green Bean Fries for $4. Battered fried Green Beans with a Wasabi dipping sauce. My favorite for years. I have been watching my calories and dieting so nothing on the menu suited my interests except salad. However, as I was studying the Grill section of the menu the Chicken and Spinach dish caught my eye. Served in a Iron skillet with Miso oriental soy sauce, onions, Yellow Squash, mushrooms (which the cook forgot), sautéed spinach and grilled chicken breast topped with Sesame seeds. A delicious cherry tomato and mozzarella salad is served tossed in Balsamic vinegar. This dish was.....a party on my palette. VERY FILLING. All at 440 Calories.   I highly recommend this item. I topped off my dinner with the half size Brownie Obsession. Vanilla icecream, walnut topped brownie. Warmed accurately and the combination of the cold vanilla ice cream was heavenly.  Perfect portion control for $4.  The bar is great and now that the food is good, I will be back. Our server was a sweetheart and the manager Issac made rounds to every table.

I had no problem with the genre of music but it was too loud and caused me to feel uncomfortable and found myself yelling to talk to my girlfriend which was a couple inches away from me. Second of all the service was horrible the waiter had no idea what he was doing he had no sense of direction and seemed confused and lost. The food was good but service was shitty. I and my girlfriend did not get our drinks until the dessert had come.

We told the server the area we were sitting at was chilly and asked if we could move to a booth and she said it was okay and didn't even tell our new server we were there so we waited an additional 15 minutes.

Nevertheless me and my brother sat at the bar for about 15-20 minutes before we were even acknowledged.

Being in the hospitality industry, I like to think terrible visits are isolated incidents, but that's just not the case here.  My last visit here was in the middle of the week at 1:30 in the afternoon, so of course we were seated immediately. There were 3 other tables already sat in the main dining room by the bar and it still took over 30 minutes for us to even place an order. Our server just kind of wandered about and forgot about us. My date & I each ordered off of the lunch menu. When the food finally came out, half the order was completely wrong. My date ordered the bruschetta pasta because she's vegetarian & the dish came with chicken. That's weird because the menu doesn't say that at all. I can't blame the server entirely for that, but there should be some type of communication when someone orders something and you throw meat inside when it's not listed. Then her side salad was completely wrong as well. We ordered a Cobb salad with avocado vinaigrette. We received a Caesar salad. Then we also ordered a Sam Adams Pumkpinhead, but when the server came over with it, she said ""it's usually darker than this but they said this is the right beer. You can try it if you want"" and it was clearly an entirely different beer, but at that point we just kept it.  All in all, it was slow service mixed with inadequacy topped with zero floor presence.

So, we ordered regular cokes to drink. After being served, she never gave us any straws .... we waited 15 minutes for that.  Finally after 45 minutes of waiting to order drinks and appetizers.... our appetizers came and we had NO utensils .  Nothing to eat with, no forks, spoons, knives, or plates. My boyfriend asked her for some napkins, along with utensils and plates ; she said "" You guys have to wait , technically the table next you guys were here first so I have to serve them first, right?

The other table next to us had nothing to do with us having utensils. No matter what, before food is served, utensils are usually always given before. It is common sense . She came back to give us plates and slammed it down on the table.  I asked a lady at the bar to speak with the manager and she said "" The manager is very busy right now "".

My dine in experience was when they first open so I had absolutely no complaints.  It all started to go downhill a few years later when we started to order takeout. The first time we ordered take out we called in and ordered burgers, when we arrived they stated they no longer had any burgers left so we needed to order something else. To my understanding I was expecting a phone call I thought that was the reason why they take your number and on another note who runs out of burgers.  Ok, a year later we gave this location another chance. We called and ordered something I can't remember and when we got there we waited over 56 mins for our order and it was cold.  Now, today is what bring me to write this review. I was craving steak and my husband wanted ribs so we thought let's order takeout. We called ahead and when I arrived to my surprise it wasn't ready. I orders the ribeye with spinach and mash and he ordered a full rack of ribs and shrimp with side of mash and coleslaw. I wanted my steak medium cause I know they cook it longer so it would of been medium well. First off my steak was well done and very tough I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife and when I finally cut it, it had way too much fat. I didn't even eat the spinach. The mash taste like it normally do. Then I tried to cut my husband ribs and that was tough no meat was falling off of the bone.

The waiter took our order for drinks and we thought all was going well. Shortly afterwards we placed our order with the waiter. As we were engaging in conversation and the younger members of our group enjoyed the sports on tv, there was a loud outburst of cursing and loud talking at the bar. Security stood near bar. Shortly afterwards this turned into an argument where profanity was shouted this was allowed to go on much longer than expected especially with security standing there. Finally one of the parties involved left and shouted her way out the door. There were several minors exposed to this. As soon a she left, there was a man who stood up and started with his foul language. To drown out the noise, music was played loudly where we could no longer engage in an adult conversation, not even with the person right next to us. The music was geared towards a younger crowd. I thought it was a great idea to use the music to help calm things down. Our meals were brought to our table by two men other then our waiter. One of the men was rude and arrogant attitude as we tried to help with who ordered, he made the comment ""before I can put this down I have to put this down first"". His tone was abrupt. We received 8 meals, the waiter came over and said he would follow up. No utensils were brought to the table. Waiter came back and apologized and said they didn't prepare it and he was sorry for the delay, he assured her it would come. The remaining party requested utensils so their food wouldn't get cold since the AC was up way too high for a cool 70 degree evening that was windy. Even with sweaters we shimmered. 10 minutes later we received utensils and the waiter came over to apologize again stating her meal still wasn't ready. We all ate our meal and sat for an additional 30 minutes with several more complaints made to waiter and manager before her meal was delivered. They didn't bring her the complete meal, she still missing her coleslaw. Finally she ate dinner, she was told she wouldn't be charged for meal. However on the bill, her meal was entered twice but taken off once. She was then being told since she ate it there they had to put it on her bill. Manager came over again and told her waiter was new and this would be removed from her bill. The waiter remained humble and respectful so we still tipped him out of curiosity but not our usual 15- 20%. Also this same waiter needed a belt, he kept pulling up his pants. There should have been a dress code, droopy pants is not appropriate in a professional establishment. Also two of the meals were a disappointment, one order was fries and shrimps, the shrimps were so small and only about 6 on plate. The pasta and shrimp dish was horrible.  I'm sorry to say, we will never eat at this establishment again, this ruined our evening out as a family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=40,1.92,1.81,1.81,,1.854

Thereby averting further conflict. That left the feeling of a lack of security, which might have been sured up by providing more security at the door. But that wasn't the worst that can be said for this night out on the town. After we ordered nine plates of food eight came without utensils. It took approximately 10 to 12 minutes before knives and spoons were provided. I did mention we ordered nine meals and didn't receive the missing meal until the very end. So there were eight of us eating expecting that the last meal would arrive any minute now. To our dismay the order wasn't filled. After some haggling over rather are not the final meal should be on the house due to the order not being filled, The establishment gave us the order free of charge in an attempt to right a wrong. That was redemptive to some degree, but the whole fiasco has discourage myself and family members from dining at this establishment in the future.

Not the best place not the worst but worth a 5$ Long Island,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=20,1.92,1.8,1.8,,1.848

They were no bigger than Wendys chicken sandwich, and the bacon was cold. The fries were (like the end of the bag) little pieces.  Returned it immediatley and ordered endless appitizers. The waitress said the portions were tiny. 3 to 4 bites, and that i couldnt order another plate till i was done. I asked how long inbetween plates. 15 minutes.    we decided we were leaving. The manager NEVER came over. And we walked out , NEVER to go back again.  They kept blaming corporate for the tiny portions..... I was at this location 2 years ago, and had the same issue.   The REAL problem is CORPORATE  just like they tell you..  They dont care enough to repromand this place....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=20,1.8,1.77,1.77,,1.7820000000000003

After all that time One waitress came up to us and goes there's no waiter for your table but I'll take your order... when I asked for a manager not only did that take another 15 mins but the manager on staff informed up that because he just got into work he would not be able to help us! As if it wasn't bad enough we just wasted 35 mins of our time a manager decides he doesn't want to help a customer at his location !!! Like wow!!! How did this guy even get this position!! The attitude of the staff and that manager of that location is atrocious!!! I will never return to this location!!! They need to have extreme training done at that location ! I am a manager myself and once I walk in the store of my job I am instantly about the company I work for and the customers who shop there ! Never would I tell a customer I just got in I can't help you because I would not have a job to return to!! You need to seriously investigate or retrain this entire store !!

149,Cassandra A.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-09,"I've been coming to this place for the past 3-4 years and it never cease to amaze me. Every single time I come it's it seems to be getting worst. I don't know why I keep coming here, I guess it's because I always try to give this place the benefit of the doubt. First off not once or twice but numerous times the host/ hostess is rude (sucking their teeth, loud and just not welcoming at all) it's annoying because I'm hungry and The last thing I wanna have to deal with is rude disrespectful people especially if it's your job to make someone feel welcomed, at this point my appetite is already gone and I feel disgusted. Then the wait time before someone can even come to the table is long. Not forgetting one time it was so busy, the manager decided to help out. He was sweating buckets, I ordered a pink punk cosmos, you won't believe what he did - so he  wiped his sweat of his head then used that same hand to break piece of the cotton candy to make the drink. I almost threw up when I saw that, thank god we were sitting right by the bar so I saw. None the less there's more but too much to write I'm here again, let's see how this goes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=40,1.64,1.74,1.74,,1.7000000000000002

The loaded potato skins came with barely any cheese and almost no bacon on some of them. The French onion soup was disgustingly sweet and the steak was mediocre. I ordered my food about 5 minutes after my family ordered theirs and it didn't even come until everyone was finished (20-30 minutes after). My server argued with me when I refused to take it to go and said it was late because I ordered after.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream,1.64,1.74,1.74,,1.7000000000000002

This is a place that you can go and get away with order lots of food and paying an awesome price. We were seated right away and greeted with a friendly smile from the waitress right away. We got there around 3:30 pm. The place was basically empty. I had a pleasurable experience. I will be back. Thank you. Side note.

Or how two ladies came in after me and the male greeter was eager to sit them and left me waiting, but I won't.  Or how a greeter brought me to a table and i asked for a different table and she said hold on and never returned, but won't. Or how there are employees that walk around with blue gloves on wiping and cleaning off the tables, empty the trash and who knows what else with those gloves on, but I won't.... So can someone please tell me why this person with the cleaning blue glove on, get me napkins with the same cleaning blue gloves and think that ok! Needless to say, i never touched those napkins...but I won't any that stuff.  (Sidebar)Another reviewer mentioned an employee who had his pants hangin off his ass...i saw him too. As he walked pass the manager who never corrected that employee on proper dress code...unless SAGGIN is the T.G.I.F code of conduct. (Ok back finishing this review) So in the meantime I'm standing there waiting and waiting. In steps Leslie for stepping in with the biggest of smile and the warmest of greetings. Lets just say she did everything to right the wrongs and made me forget the not so good start at T.G.I.F. Quinten came out from the kitchen to check and make sure the special order I requested came out to my liking. Thank very much Leslie and Quinten for making a difference... Finally... I had a issue this my bill. (Because i didn't ask questions, so it was more my fault) But Derrick the manager adjusted my bill without blinking an eye. Now thats how you keep a custom.

We were greeted pleasantly by the hostess. She sat us down. We said that it was too cold at our booth and she was nice enough to reseat us promptly at another and requested that the heat be turned up a bit in the resturant, which we thought was nice. Our drinks took a bit long to come out and the water probably in need of a BRITA water filter or something but otherwise the drinks were okay. Our waitress Anna was also really nice. She came over an checked up on us periodically for what we needed. We were surprised when the manager came over after and asked us if everything went okay and it was. My gf surprised me with a nice birthday song by the staff. This place is cool when they are not too busy.

They're too busy playing/joking & carrying on behind the bar with each other to take care of their guests. 3-4 bartenders with 15 total guests shouldn't warrant 15 mins to be asked for your drink order, nor 25 mins total to receive that order. I do this for a living as well so I am more than lenient & forgiving if someone is in the weeds but this definitely was no the case, just an ongoing crash of glasses/plates breaking & screwing around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream,1.64,1.77,1.77,,1.7180000000000002
159,Jessica F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-12,"My uber eats order is always incorrect. I either receive the wrong order, or I have the correct order with missing items. The whole location needs to be evaluated internally​. Corporate needs to visit this location and retrain the management to the table cleaners. The community deserves better. I could not even call to tell the manager about my complaints because the receptionist took the phone off the hook, so all callers get is a busy signal. The manager who I have had to call several times about the same issue with the uber eats is entirely incompetent and as unprofessional is the rest of the staff. The manager continually suggests I should come to the restaurant to rectify the issue, but that defeats the purpose of uber eats. The staff is additionally over all rude. If I could order my food on uber eats from another location, I would, but I am out of range for a more preferred location. PLEASE VISIT THIS LOCATION AND RETRAIN THE STAFF AND BRING IN OUTSIDE HELP TO MAKE SURE THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED, RECTIFIED, AND REMAIN RESOLVED!
