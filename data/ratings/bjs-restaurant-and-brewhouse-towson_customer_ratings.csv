117,Jen D.,"Nottingham, MD",0,26,7.0,4.0,2015-06-17,"Brand new place. Really cool atmosphere. My husband had a beer and I had a skinny Rita. Both good. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The pizza (deep dish) was good! Flakey and not too greasy. Our waiter talked us into downloading the BJs app to start collecting reward points, so we did. When the bill came, my husband noticed you can pay through the app, so he did. We left. The waiter ran after us into the parking garage. We asked if we forgot something and he said, ""you didn't pay!"" We told him we paid through the app. It was the first time he had a guest pay through the app...honest mistake on his part. Also, the restaurant will validate your parking. We had them validate it, but when we put the ticket in, it wasn't validated. We paid...it is only $2 to park anyway. Overall, good food. But the app needs some help!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=120,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003
59,Jonathan P.,"Cockeysville, MD",100,91,82.0,5.0,2015-06-18,I am throughly impressed by this place!  BJ's just opened a few days ago. They have a great atmosphere and ambience. The service is really good. Our waiter was very attentive and super helpful in recommending dishes. The food was amazing. I had the jambalaya. The rice and shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish overall had great flavor. My wife had a burger with fries which was really good as well. We couldn't stop eating the fries (lol) and the burger was juicy with great flavor.  There is a huge selection of beer. We had the Nit Nat(I think that's the name) which was good. Desert was amazing. We had the macadamia nut white chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. We don't usually have desert but maaaaaaaan this desert was da BOMB!!! Lol. We will definitely be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=60,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.380000000000001
58,Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68.0,3.0,2015-06-18,"Came in for the opening day which was my second time after the soft opening and to be quite honest it lacked a lot. While the decor and building itself has very good architecture and the fire place outside is an eye catcher. The food defiantly leaves you dissatisfied. The food was similar to that of a Chilis or a tgi Friday's with the exception of an incredible beer menu. I did try the banana beer which was tasty.  The country fried chicken with gravy was truly an embarrassment, being from the south I know what country fried chicken is supposed to be like. The chicken was extremely dry and sadly placed upon a mediocre pile of less then desirable mashed potatoes and the dish was decorated with corn kernels as if it was a decoration not a side. The gravy was thick and lacked flavor. The avocado egg rolls were the worse. The sauces did not accompany the appetizer well and tasted very similar. They were not crispy and were soggy in less then a few minutes. No one at the table was satisfied with them.  My friend ordered the flatbread and salad and he was not that impressed either For dessert we shared the pazookie which is a cookie with ice cream which was expressed to be the best dessert and in reality all it is, is a big cookie overly sweet and soft almost undercooked with store bought ice cream on top with some kind of drizzle depending upon what you order... Defiantly seems like a lower end restaurant presenting itself as upscale. With a clientel base of college students and late night drinkers. personally have no desire to return in the near future.  With all that said the staff was very friendly and seemed to be learning very well about the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=60,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

54,Kerri M.,"Baltimore, MD",42,160,13.0,1.0,2015-06-24,"I was going to give this place, two stars but reconsidered because it was really that bad of an experience. The only good thing this place has going for it is the beer selection. I guess the service from the wait staff was also acceptable, but still not enough to give this place two stars. Open, airy space. Got a Chilis vibe going on. Multiple TV's.  Menu is rather large and too extensive, which is probably part of the problem. Menu is also kind of boring. Nothing really special or eye catching. Typical stuff like burgers, salad, sandwiches, pizza, etc. Started off with the potato skins as an appetizer. Boy were they bland. Tasteless. My partner ordered the black & bleu burger and he could not finish it because it was so bland. The fries that came with the burger were of the shoestring variety. They also lacked salt.  I ordered the Kale & Brussel sprout salad with chicken. It was awful. It was a super soggy mess and I could not finish it. Why was it so soggy and floppy? The dressing that it had been soaking in was not good either - strawberry vinaigrette. Didn't really taste of much other than vinegar. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it, but it definitely had bleu cheese in it. Bleh.  This is just a generic place trying too hard not to be generic by charging a lot for their plain food.  Really regret coming here and will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=60,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003
73,Alexis T.,"Pasadena, MD",14,11,20.0,3.0,2015-06-25,"Stopped in to check out the happy hour. It was different then what I found on the website, $1 off beers and cocktails, $2 off shareable appetizers and flatbreads, 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas, and $3 for two of the beers that I can't recall. I thought the happy hour food pricing was great but I feel like the drinks could've been better like I saw on the website. My friends and I started off with a beer taster, we tried 4 beers for $7.95 and it's worth it if you're not sure what you want/like. The menu is very intensive with a lot of food and alcohol options. I really enjoyed the berry cider that they have and I would recommend that. I shared the sliders with thin fries and they were ok. The burgers were seasoned really heavily, too much for my liking.  Our server was very nice. She kept checking on us and was being very attentive.  I wouldn't mind coming back and trying a main dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005
78,Paul S.,"Towson, MD",84,158,69.0,5.0,2015-06-28,"This place has it all.  A really big menu so everyone can find something for them. The items are huge servings and have big flavor, you are garenteed to be well fed for the amount of money you put out.  A lot of premium beers for the beer connoisseur as well as lots of great tasting mocktails and sodas straight from the tap. So even the non drinker can have a fun drinking experience.  I'm a non drinker and want to try every soda and mocktail on the menu. You will love the orange cream soda, its like drinking a slightly carbonated creamsicle.. Great atmosphere, very spacious and a clear view into the kitchen.  -Super friendly wait staff and management, even the most simple of mistakes will be corrected with kindness right away. Never have to wait on additional requests, food delivery time to the table or drink refills. Even pay your check on their app to really cut down the wait time.  I've been here twice now, very little if anything to complain about, they are so kind and welcoming. The place is great for friends to hang out at and enjoy good food at drinks. This is like a Fridays, but on a much higher level of quality.  They have everything from sandwiches, steaks, tacos, pizza, etc. etc. Everyone will find something to eat.  I love how they use matchstick fries, something unique to bring to the table because I never see them anymore. As a kid I loved having a pile of matchstick fries with my burger so it was like my inner child smiled.  I plan on being a regular here, trying as much of the menu as possible. If you plan on being a regular too, download their app for advanced seating, to go orders, bill pay, and reward points for coupons and free food. Each point is equal to one dollar spent.  I think many chain restaurants could learn a thing or two from the way BJs does things.  A+ on all fronts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007
1,Kevin J.,"Evesham Township, NJ",39,207,11.0,4.0,2015-06-29,"I had a great experience at BJ's on Sunday night.  Beer- I tried the hefferveisen and my wife got the stout. We both liked the beers. The stout was better and had a unique taste. The hefferviesen was not heavy enough for my liking, but it was still good. Not enough heff! The price point at $5.75 a beer is a little steep. I heard they have a happy hour. I will come back one night and sample more of their brews during that time.  Food- The food was excellent. Their menu is huge, maybe too huge. I had a double burger and my wife had some kind of chicken sandwich. Both were great, had flavor, large proportions and were reasonably priced. Their thinly cut French fries are awesome! I saw a couple deep dish pizza's around them room. They looked good. Atmosphere- Nothing crazy to report home about. It was clean, new, and spacious. Looked like there was plenty of space at the bar and adequate seating.  Service- Top notch! Attentive hostesses and wait staff.  Other- They have a decent rewards program I signed up for. Check it out at their website before they go. Apparently you can pay via app. I did't do this, but that seems new and high tech.   There are now a ton of good restaurants in that square there by the movie theater. This is one of the better ones.

I am thrilled its open.  1st thing - do this now - RIGHT NOW - go to their website and join the premier club. It takes 24 hours to go into effect, and you want to make sure you get your points!  I will elaborate later on the quality and consistency of the service (AMAZING), the quality and flavors of the food (also AMAZING), and atmosphere (PERFECT).  You would not believe this was a chain if it weren't for all the technological awesomeness they have thrown in through their website and app. Group orders, where you can pay separately, that you can place before you go for carry out OR DINE IN!!!! Are you frickin kidding? this is the solution to short lunch breaks! having your lunch waiting for you when you arrive saves at least 10 minutes.  Now the service was amazing, but that was because we had Shea as our server. I don't know if everyone that works there is as wonderful, but if you get Shea you're in for a great experience.

The first time our Bartender forgot to put in our food order and since we had a movie to catch, we weren't able to get it. Second time wings took 25+ minutes to arrive to the table and the ribs were extremely tough. We said something to the server and she didn't even acknowledge the complaint. The third and worst time we sat in the cocktail area and we stared at our drinks for 10 minutes before we had to flag our server down to get them.

I was excited to see that there was a new one opening within minutes from my house. The menu is very extensive, and in the years that I have been going to BJ's, I have never had bad meal. Portion size is good, prices are fair, and the beer selection is great. They actually brew their own beer. The managers are nice and walk around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal, and the staff is friendly. I have been to this location maybe 6 times since it has opened. Some of my favorites are the California club flatbread, shrimp pasta, lemon thyme chicken, chicken wings...I could go on!

Our server, Maryana, was impeccable. Our party had pushed two tables together in her section (she even helped move them!) and she handled our large party effortlessly. Drinks were rung in and came out quickly (the bar was slow and I noticed her get a bartenders attention to make sure they knew a drink order was in). Encouraged us to join the rewards program, which I did. Food came out perfectly, in a good amount of time, and was delicious! I got a mini deep dish pizza. So. Freaking. Good. Crust is buttery and crispy...I love it! Maryana was very attentive, unobtrusively offering refills on drinks as necessary, and bringing other little things (extra sides of mayo and such) and clearing empty plates with cheer and good humor.

The appetizers were mushy and greasy - the avocado spring roll thing is terrible.  Drinks were watered down and really sugary. The only reason for two stars - service was fine and the beer selection was pretty good.  They did some cool ""layering"" with their beers.  Aside from that, I would strongly avoid this place.  Their menu is so expansive that instead of making 15-20 quality items, they have 200+ terrible items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=60,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

I can only imagine it was frozen. The avocado was mushy and brown. My Guest got a salad and the dressing was overly sweet as was the dipping sauce for the appetizer. It was nearly a small bowl of molasses. Draft beer was good and my lunch entrée was acceptable. I mostly felt like it was any chain restaurant.

18,Kate R.,"Cockeysville, MD",10,4,,5.0,2015-10-02,"We don't go out to eat often so it's always a bummer when we have a disappointing experience. Such was not the case AT ALL with BJ's. We couldn't have been more thrilled. In fact, I think we were in a better mood when we left than we were when we got there! The food is pretty much what you would expect if you're looking for pub-type fare but I couldn't believe the options. It wasn't just burgers and wings, there were so many interesting things on the menu. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was delicious. I love that they have an ""EnLIGHTened"" portion of their menu.  The food was good but the staff was incredible. We ordered a pitcher of beer and realized pretty soon that the waitress brought us the wrong beer. We let her know and she apologized and told us to just finish the pitcher we had and that she would bring a new one with the beer that we ordered at no extra cost to us. That was pretty much all my boyfriend needed to hear. It was a simple gesture but it goes a long way in terms of customer service. She was quick, attentive but not TOO attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. It wasn't just her though, the hostess was great and every single staff member that we encountered was friendly and just GOOD at their job. We even called the manager over to let her know how impressed we were. We were there once before but just had drinks at the bar and the bartender was SO friendly and engaging. She overheard us talking about movies and ended up talking movies with us for the next ten minutes which was so fun. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible beer selection.  Often times when you go out to eat, if a waiter or waitress isn't assigned to a table then they don't want to help that table and I get that. They work on tips and every second counts so I wouldn't hold that against anyone. But it seems like the staff at BJ's is trained to treat every single customer well regardless of whether or not they'll be tipped by that customer. It's rare and it's truly impressive.  I hope the place sticks around for a long time and I hope that a lot of people have the amazing experience that my boyfriend and I had.

118,Jamie B.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,16,,1.0,2015-10-12,"This was a very disappointing dinner. I'll start my review with the food: Calamari Appetizer- Not that crispy. Included more ""rings"" than tentacles.  Sirloin steak cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts: steak was not medium rare. It was more like medium with the outside very well done. Hard to explain... but it was tough. It did have a tasty rub on it though, but since it was so dry I had to ask for steak sauce. The mashed potatoes were very good but you really can't mess that up. The brussel sprouts were dry, flavorless, and luke warm.  Greek chicken wrap: My mom ordered this and while I did not try it, she said that it was not that good. The rice salad served with it was cold and she didn't like it.  Jambalaya: My dad ordered this and I did try it. I thought it had okay flavor. It had some spice. But he wasn't impressed. It had a lot of sauce and should have been served with bread. He asked for some bread, which the waiter did bring out, but he seemed kind of put off.  Pink Cadillac martini- this drink tasted very good but I felt that it had more juice than alcohol. Usually a martini is a bit stronger. This was more like a fruity mixed drink.  Service: we had come here to celebrate my mother's birthday. I told the person on the phone when I made the reservation that it was her birthday and asked if they did anything. They said yes. Well... they did nothing. It was a bit disappointing especially after the sub par food. Also I had asked the waiter if he recommended the steak, and if it was tender. He said yes. We also asked him if calamari was good, he said it was the most popular appetizer. My mother asked him if the greek chicken wrap was a good choice, and he said it was popular. Lies!

The food came quickly and we jumped on some fries - they serve very skinny, well done fries which we thought were great - similar to Smashburger fries...probably previously frozen but delicious nonetheless (that was for Adam D who sees frozen fries as a dealbreaker).  My daughter LOVED her fish...yes, it's just fried fish, but it wasn't too greasy and was very flavorful.  My burger was done just as I requested (medium) and the brisket and bacon topping was a home run.   Since neither of us had eaten a real dinner, we also ordered dessert...a Pizzookie Trio.  If you've never had a Pizzookie, it's a 3""=4"" cookie served HOT in a small metal ramekin-like dish and topped with ice cream...UMMMMMMMMMM, OK!!!!!!   We had the Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia, and the Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli Chocolate.  First off, when you order the trio you should actually have three people as ONE Pizzookie and ice cream is enough for one person...However, full disclosure-I don't like leaving delicious food on the table so I toughed it out.   I was really pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal.  I like being able to spend time with the kids eating out like this as I know it will be short lived as they will be off to college sooner than I know.  I could EASILY return to BJs for another meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.8640000000000003,3.5200000000000005

They have made several good recommendations.  I've enjoyed the dinners I've had there--particularly the Asian Chicken Salad and the Steak.  (I think they recently dropped that salad from their menu but they do have others which I will try in the future.)  They have plenty of TV's so you can catch a game while you're there.  (I kinda wish they gave the option of having the small boxes where you can get the audio for the game you're watching as opposed to the music over the PA.)  I would recommend downloading their smartphone app since they do offer some freebies (such as appetizers).  They also offer free wifi.  (Side note: another nearby restaurant also offers wifi and their signal is pretty strong.

On the second visit, they forgot his salad, and the third visit, they forgot our fries. The seared ahi salad is great, quite a lot of flavor and very fresh. It does have a somewhat hidden streak of wasabi running through it, so be warned of sudden heat. The mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are good, though the multitude of sauces get a little muddled together.

She recommended the Strawberry Patch and it was really good, when I say good I mean really good. It hit the spot! We also ordered two Twisted BLT salads with mini pizzas, I had the buffalo chicken mini pizza and she had some type of meat pizza. The salad was very good, I should have requested no blue cheese crumbles since I'm not a huge fan of them. The buffalo pizza was okay, but it looked amazing. I would recommend putting more buffalo sauce on the pizza, I hardly taste any actually. My bestfriend meat pizza was good. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.

They had drink specials for the games that were playing on the numerous TVs. I ended up ordering a berry beer which I thought was a cider since it was listed under ""Cider & Fruit Beers"" but my eyes only read Cider lol. Surprisingly (even though I really don't like beer) this was super tasty! Probably because it tasted nothing like beer, but more like a fruit wine spritzer aka super girly but I don't care! It was really refreshing and easy to drink. Our bartender even gave me a shot's worth of the Berry Burst Cider which they have an option to mix with the Belgian fruit beer I was drinking.

For dinner I decided to be a little bland and ordered the chicken club, my friend got a jalapeño burger. Both came out very timely and hot. I love these kind of shoe string fries, crispy yet flavorful. Chicken could of been seasoned a bit more and the bread ended up a little soggy but overall ingredients were fresh and well cooked.

He advised against this restaurant due to his lackluster food on his initial visit. I thought maybe they were having an off day and his pizza wasn't delicious that one time and another shot should be given. Boy was I wrong!  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Our waitress was between rude and slightly nice? She was not excited at all and her demeanor was as if she had better things to be doing instead of being a polite server. We also noticed there were cliques of employees and lots of standing around doing nothing, this isn't optimal behavior at a restaurant. Now on to the food, the root beer wings were really good. The deep dish pizza was not- tasteless and no sauce to speak of, crust was buttery and greasy and the waitress wasn't surprised I said something about the lack of sauce she just brought out a cup of marinara sauce... I'm sad to say that we didn't even order dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed with that. Also I'd like to add I was disappointed by the response to the no sauce on the pizza, she didn't even inquire if we wanted a new pizza made, she just brought the sauce which was tacky in my opinion. I also think with a complaint like that, a manager should've been notified to inquire how the experience can be upgraded to encourage another visit. So maybe this review will help you to determine if this the place to go for your next dining out experience, I'm not saying I'll never go back but I hope that they get better service and food before I do.

92,Lynna O.,"Damascus, MD",0,6,9.0,2.0,2016-08-01,"Not such a great experience at all. Not what I was expecting at all. Defiantly not a DEEP dish. More like a fat hand tossed pizza crust.  Pizza Hut tastes better... Let me explain.  I would just 1st like to start by mentioning that BJs offers "" curbside delivery "" when you are placing a carry out order.  I placed my order around 8:30pm. I was told it would be about 15-20min for my delivery. When I called and requested the curbside, no one asked for a number to reach me on, no one asked for what make and model I would be in and no one mentioned where to park for this "" curbside "" that is offered.  I ordered a medium size pepperoni and cheese  CHICAGO deep dish pizza. I called BJs back to let them know I was in the front of the restaurant parked in a valet spot, because there are no designated "" curbside "" delivery spots. When I called again, no one asked what car I would be in, I had to mention it.  Around 9pm I got irritated and walked in and asked for my pizza. It was just sitting the heated area where pizzas are dropped off. I payed my bill, walked to car and checked the pizza ( they did not open the box to check the pizza). I noticed it was a chicken and bbq pizza... Not what I ordered. So I walked back in and ask to speak with the manager because I was simply irritated at this point.  He had offered to give me a Large pepp and cheese pizza that was already in the over and remove my charge for the incorrect pizza. I said okay and asked about the curbside the restaurant offered. He only said that he would walk it out. Didn't really answer anything about curbside for me at all.  15more min later and after everything I got my pizza around 9:30... Not cool.  Got home and tried eating the pizza, but it was way too doughy... It looked done on the outside but the cooked part of the pizza peeled right off and there was the base of the pizza... Doughy. There were some kind of bruschetta tomatoes on top? Design I guess? But they were all Over the pizza. No where on the menu did it mention that.  I'll say that it might have been that they were in a rush to give me a pizza because of the error that occurred previously, but at least have some sort of pride in what you give to your customers. The pics online looks like BJs has amazing food. I was excited to try it but super let down even after the manager tried to fix it. Terrible.  Don't know if It's worth going back. The only good thing out of this was that this terrible pizza that was not eaten was free.  2 stars for BJs. Customer service was horrible, the manager tried to fix this error, but this could of all been prevented if management had a process in place for carry out food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6960000000000006,3.2000000000000006

105,Sarah P.,"Middle River, MD",114,4,,1.0,2016-09-03,"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in Towson. There are many decent local places to choose from in this area, and I really wish we would have opted for one of those.  My husband and I came in to watch college football and have dinner. We sat at the bar right in front of the game we wanted to see. I ordered the queso with chips, and the Twisted BLT salad.  My husband ordered a full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes.  Oh where to begin? The queso came out lukewarm and the chips were extremely stale. I asked them to reheat it since it was like eating coagulated velveeta.  My salad came out drenched in dressing. I don't know if the spinach was going bad and they were trying to cover it up, or if the half cup of dressing wilted the spinach. There was also no bacon on the salad. Nice BLT with no B! My hubby's mashed potatoes tasted like potato gum. Instant,  I guess. Gross. The ribs were the worst we have ever had. They had the consistency of overcooked chicken; dense and chewy with the flavor of a McRib. Also, the game we were clearly watching was turned off twice (channel change), which was remedied both times...once, ok. But twice? Weird! Beyond the terrible food was the service. Both bartenders were pleasant but not proactive at all. They never came back after the food was delivered so I didn't get a chance to tell them how bad everything was. When we told her we wanted to pay the check she then asked, ""Do you want boxes to take this home?"" I told her,  ""No, that was pretty much the worst food I ever had."" Her reply was, ""Oh! I could have gotten you something else!"" Well yeah, I guess if you had checked on us that would have been an option. She then removed just one plate of the disastrous food we left behind, instead of getting it out of my sight. It also clearly did not occur to her to be proactive enough to have a manager come talk to us. After she returned our credit card and we sat to finish our drinks for about another 20 mins, we never saw her again.

However, we were not greeted or given drinks for at least 10 minutes. Additionally, we were never given napkins for the messy dessert and the spoons we received were dirty. They never brought out our french fries and I had to call our waitress over to ask about the status of the fries. She never came over to check on us probably because we were only a group of two which I guess makes us not as important. She was not very friendly and did not take much interest in my food allergy.

We ordered two pizzas, bacon with chicken and a Mediterranean, and a BBQ bison burger. The food was good and well presented. My only complaint was the beer. While they have a large selection of beer on tap, all the beer is kept at about 37 degrees Fahrenheit. This is fine for most lagers and ales but is too cold for porters and stouts, the finish tends to be bitter unless porters and stouts are kept at about 50 degrees.

70,Sana A.,"Laurel, MD",217,3,,1.0,2016-11-19,"This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I went to BJs on 11/18/16, a Friday night, for dinner with my cousins. Right from the get-go, our service from our waitress was unacceptable. There were no smiles as she greeted us and sat us down in our booth. We began by ordering our drinks.I requested a water with lemon. Our drinks were brought out and I noticed there were no lemon, so I reminded the waitress that I had requested it. She said ok, she would bring it out. I ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus pasta, an entree I order regularly and have grown to love. I specified I would not like any bread crumbs in my pasta, as well. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our food was brought out to us. This was the SECOND time we were seeing our waitress. She did not come check in on us while we were waiting to see if we needed anything. Yet again, she forgot to bring the lemons, although at this point, I was beginning to feel it was deliberate.  At this point, I tried pushing my frustrations aside and focusing on my meal, which I order regularly and am very familiar with. Unfortunately, my entree was on par with the customer service we were receiving... highly disappointing. There were barely 4 pieces of shrimp thrown into my pasta and of course, there were breadcrumbs.  I began looking for my waitress to let her know my food was not acceptable, however she was NO WHERE to be found. Yet again, she was not checking on us AT ALL. As I sat there and waited, everyone else at my table was eating their food. This was supposed to be my first real meal of the day, considering I worked all day, and I had really been looking forward to it. By the time our waitress finally showed up, I had eaten most of my meal. This was the third time we were seeing our waitress that night. She did not come check on us while we were waiting for our food, and she did not come check on us while we were eating our food. It was obvious she was not committed to providing us the customer service we usually receive at this restaurant. Nonetheless, I went ahead and informed her of my dissatisfaction. Instead of trying to alleviate my concerns, all she said was ""let me go get a manager.""  At this point, I had enough. This situation would not have escalated if our waitress had taken responsibility for her mistakes and offered us a sincere apology. The first manager that came out, a Caucasian woman, made the situation even worse. She didn't even bother to listen as I recounted our horrible experience and the nasty attitude of our waitress. All she could focus on was the fact that I had eaten a majority of the entree. I told her that I order this entree regularly, and there was significantly less shrimp than normal. After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Even the manager was talking to us in such a rude manner, instead of apologizing for our ruined meal. Eventually she cut the conversation short and asked ""So, what is it that you want me to do?"" It was obvious that my concerns meant NOTHING to her and that she just wanted to shut me up at this point. I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS AT THIS POINT because never have I, ever, been spoken to this way, at a place I chose to give my business to. At this point, I wanted this meal from hell to be over, so I told the manager there was nothing she could do for me at this point and to please just bring our check. She did not offer any ways she could alleviate my distress or come to a solution, she just said ok and left. A few minutes later, our waitress dropped our check off at our table without saying A WORD to us. There was no ""thank you for choosing to dine with us"" or ""im sorry your meal did not turn out the way you expected"" or even ""i hope you have a great night"". SHE. DID. NOT. SAY. A. WORD. This is what sent me over the edge. They were not treating us like humans at this point, much less paying customers. I took a look at the check and saw my entree on the bill, full price. When the waitress came back, I let her know I refused to pay for my meal, so she went to get the manager again. This time another manager came out, an African American male. He was much kinder than the others.He went ahead and apologized for and took the entree off our check. As we were waiting for him to bring our new check out, our waitress stood at the bar with two other waitresses. She was loudly and profanely telling them about how I ate my food and then didn't want to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. I was being accused of being a cheap liar right in front of my face. I was literally being attacked for speaking up about the unacceptable service she gave us. When the male manager returned. I informed him of what I had just witnessed. He said he did not see it, so there wasn't much he could do. On our way out, one of the waitresses called after me ""don't go out if you can't afford it."" Needless to say, I will never be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.372,3.1600000000000006

We've been during very busy times, but also at lunch when the restaurant is only half full and it tends to be slow. The servers are usually good, although once or twice that's also been part of the problem.    We continue to go because the food is always good, the FOOD IS ALWAYS GOOD, and it's convenient when going to movies. But no one wants to have to rush out to make it to a show, or be late, when you leave ample time to make it.    So our mixed feelings continue.

I ordered the Ahi Poke as an appetizer. Someone from the kitchen brought that before we received our drinks or silverware. We thought we would try the beer sampler which provided four beers of your choosing in sampler glasses. Those were perfect and they even label the beer in front of each glass. For dinner the wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad and I chose the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. For the appetizer and entrée the tuna was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the chicken tacos and the dressing that was added on the side was a perfect combination.

Briefly, here were my issues during our last visit: - While we had a somewhat large party (7 adults), our wait was one hour and 15 minutes. There were two 12 tops that remained empty the entire time we waited AND the entire time we ate our meal (as we left, they finally split one of the 12 tops for two families). The staff easily could have split one of the twelve tops (they obviously weren't holding it for a reservation or a walk up group). - My meal came with no sauce even though the menu listed a sauce...it was so dry and flavorless. - My meal was listed as ""spicy"" but there was no spice...nor any flavor...again, zero flavor. That said, it wasn't all bad... - The menu has lots of interesting items (but since there is no flavor to their food, it doesn't matter if there are 500 items on the menu). - Our waiter was fantastic, so maybe their focus is customer service instead of focusing on quality of the food. People who prefer corporate dining over local restaurants, places that are the same in Topeka as they are in Wilmington, will love this BJ's.

BF really liked his burger, and I was a fan of the fries that he got with them. My pizza was SO greasy. The pizza itself tasted good but the crust was just a sponge of grease.

BJs curbside lunch was my routine every few weeks. It was speedy. The host was very nice and met me at my card with food.  My visit today reminded me of how cumbersome my last visit here was and I wish I would've remembered before I placed my order. Now when you arrive curbside and call the curbside number they tell you ""you gonna have to come to the bar To get your order"" .  (This happened last time too) This review is more  so to speak on the staffing .  There are two hosts at the front. A runner that brings to go orders to the bar (not sure if they're a waitress too) . The bartender is left to take to go orders, cash them out, serve drinks at the bar and tend to food orders as well. The bartender has a heavy load to carry , yet is the most pleasant of the employees out of all of the other employees that are far from busy while the bartender takes on everything.  The bartender asked the runner if she could bag my order that the runner brought out while the bartender was making a drink. The runner rolled her eyes and ignored the bartender and walked back to kitchen .  The food was good as always. But the staffing during lunch can use improvement. As a customer it feels like everyone else is sitting around not offering help and everything is on the bartender .

However, it's STILL a chain restaurant, and that's important to remember.  BJ's has a good beer list, including their own, which is the real center of attention, I guess. Their actual menu is quite bloated and far too large, much like a lot of other chains (looking at you, CCF, especially). You have options here, but because there are so many things it means some of the things aren't going to be as great as the others - no restaurant staff can learn all of these items and prepare them perfectly each time. They have flatbread pizzas, burgers, tacos, ribs, sandwiches, wraps, salads, fish...far too many options. As for what we had? Two people ordered burgers, both MW. One was a bit dry with one side closer to well-done and a little black, but the other burger was perfect MW. The flatbread pizza appetizer was actually pretty good - I liked the sauce a lot.  I had the fish and chips, and the fish was cooked well with a nice breading but maybe a little greasier than expected or wanted.  All meals came with fries and the fries were actually good restaurant fries! Waitress was very nice and came back with an extra drink when I asked for a refill, so that's cool. OTOH we didn't even get a person to ask us for drinks until we had been there for about 10 minutes, so service can be slow. In the end, the food can be good, but some things are better than others...and it's a brewhouse that's trying to be a sports bar (tons of TVs and the clientele is definitely sports fans on a Sunday) and because of this, it fails to live up to its true potential.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.92,3.11,3.11,,3.034

Warm and soft, just like you'd expect it to be and more. Served alongside a huge serving of grain salad and just the right amount of both.

The Parmesan Crusted chicken was   and the portion was larger than life. Literally enough for 2, even 3, meals. Side of brocolli that it comes with could have used some extra seasoning but the chicken and mashed potatoes more than made up for it's lack thereof.

I lucked up and found a spot right out front. I look forward to returning here and trying something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.8,3.1,3.1,,2.9800000000000004
26,Tiffany D.,"Baltimore, MD",136,97,196.0,3.0,2017-11-29,"I came here to have dinner before my movie. My overall experience was great, but the food items were mediocre. The server was very nice and personable and truly made our entire experience. On another note, some of the restaurant practices were blah. They call themselves a brew house but didn't offer tastings of their wine or beers. So I ended up going safe instead of trying something new. Next, I ordered from their  $10 menu, and it was to be expected that it wouldn't be much to write home about. I was satisfied with my meal, but my girlfriend didnt care for hers. At the end, I got dessert and that was really good and on discount. Bottomline- I would go back again for dessert and half priced wine.... and maybe even to try a signature item before I completely write them off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.88,3.09,3.09,,3.006
37,Taylor H.,"Baltimore, MD",0,8,2.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"The food is SO good, which makes this one of my favorite places to eat in Towson. However, the service is hit or miss. Sometimes we will get someone wonderful and other times we will get someone who never checks in, and when you need them they are no where to be found. I'm going to keep coming just because the food is so great I just wish the staff cared more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.88,3.12,3.12,,3.0240000000000005
24,Johnny P.,"Towson, MD",27,19,59.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"Love this place after a movie in Towson or when the friends get together, also pretty nice place for a date. So many options on the menu! Favorites  Pulled pork and the root beer glazed ribs. Save room for dessert the monkey bread pizzokie is soo freaking good! Deff gotta try that if you go. Prices aren't crazy high about the same as any other chain restaurant. Service is usually pretty good and the loyalty program and being able to pay your bill from the app is def a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.88,3.12,3.12,,3.0240000000000005
30,Molly R.,"Annapolis, MD",0,2,7.0,1.0,2017-12-29,Only one star for the atmosphere. Very cozy and nice. The service and food is terrible. I came with 4 people and all of our food came out at separate times. I ordered a thai peanut dish and the smell alone made it unappetizing. Would choose another restaurant in towson before this any day. Don't recommend wasting money here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.84,3.09,3.09,,2.9899999999999998
23,Nick H.,"Baltimore, MD",30,18,2.0,2.0,2018-01-06,We have eaten here twice now. The first time was ok. Nothing stellar but nothing amazing. Food was fine and service was average. Unmemorable. So we came back recently to try this place again. The service was very slow. Snail slow. Having food in front of me for 10 minutes without silverware. Come on. Flagged down another server and it took flagging down a third to get to job done. 20 minutes with food in front of me and not able to eat it may have affected my roon temperature impression of my meal. Unfortunately this place was more memorable a second time. They have craft beer but I soent all my time trying to eat I didnt have a chance to actually enjoy this aspect. Will most likely not return. Its a great concept poorly executed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson,2.88,3.08,3.08,,3.0000000000000004
