ArJhay V.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,17,6,3.0,1/25/2015,"I'll give this place 3 stars. 1 for food, 2 for an amazing waiter (Gerald). Honestly, I'm giving this 3 just because I got lucky with my server. The hostes was not happy to see us. She didn't even acknowledge our presence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne-2
D D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,18,,1.0,9/6/2013,HORRIBLE SERVICE. Very immature staff. Especially when you first walk in.  And waiters just seem to be inexperienced. The bartenders have fun while the bar area is a mess.   I'll pass. Back to Houlihan's for me and my family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne-2
