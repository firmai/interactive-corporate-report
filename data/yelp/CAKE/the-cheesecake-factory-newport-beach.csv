Mich M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,79,104,4.0,10/15/2017,"Farfalle garlic pasta has better taste than pasta carbonara. Both of them taste great though. Service is okay. Because it was busy, we had to wait for our server for a long time.  This restaurant has become my favorite when i crave for pasta. Pasta here is better than Maggianos'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3685,2700,11555,3.0,3/21/2017,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island for our Sunday Brunch.  Bruleed French toast: extra thick slices of rustic French bread baked and grilled golden brown, topped with powdered sugar. The french toast was kinda good at first. I got tired of eating it after a while because it's super sweet. Sweet bread + powdered sugar + maple syrup = dentist's best friend. Bacon: I wish the bacon was cooked crispier.  Omelette with English muffin & tomato: the omelette and the muffin were served lukewarm and even borderline cold. The cheese inside the omelette didn't even melt!!! Our waitress was nice, but non attentive. We had to ask for everything and she almost never checked on us.  3 stars!! The Cheesecake Factory is almost yummylicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20
Travis M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,15,1,5.0,1/4/2018,"We have Cheesecake Factory cater our company holiday party every year that feeds about 50 hungry clients. The food is consistently wonderful, but this last experience was so great it had me leaving no choice but to come sing praises on yelp. Considering how above and beyond the on-duty manager was at the time, I should definitely remember his name, but Ron (or Rob) was there for me every step of the way. I placed a $1400 catering order and told him I needed it by 11:30 am which is around the time the restaurant opens. Any other restaurant would have told me it was impossible to pick up an order that large so early, so I was fully expecting to hear the same this time. Instead, I was assured it would be no problem. At one point the day of the pick up I was so nervous it wouldn't be ready I called to confirm and a gal on the phone told me to come in a few minutes later just to make sure the order was completed. Ron (or Rob) immediately called me back and said ""your order will be ready at 11:30, we don't mess around!"" I showed up at 11:30 sharp and sure enough - all 15ish bags of my food were freshly prepared and ready to go. To take this entire process one step further, he even got a crew together to help me carry all the items out to my car, himself included. Now this is the type of customer service I would never come to expect especially from a large corporate restaurant, but Cheesecake Factory is setting a new standard both with their friendly, hard working, efficient, sincere staffing, , and their food quality. Thank you GM Ron (or Rob) for providing me with a restored faith in catering cuisine, and I'm sorry I don't remember your name!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20

Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in 20+ years and was pleasantly surprised at how I've overlooked this place all these years.

However, after our move to Newport Beach we decided to go the nearest location i.e. Located in fashion island.  We have been here few times despite very average customer service and food because it's the most convenient for us. however our recent visits made me write this review. It's the worst Cheesecake Factory we have ever been. After waiting for 45 minutes the food came cold, much smaller portions then any other location we been to and to top that a shambolic customer service!

I am so glad I haven't returned to this location since my horrible experience a couple months ago. See my previous review and many of the other recent low star reviews as this type of service they treat their customers. *As a quick summary of my previous review, the food brought to the table was wrong 2 times before the third plate that was finally brought out to be correct, the fire alarms were going off the whole time (I have video proof), and there was no sincere apology or accommodation for a mistake on the staff's end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20

Linda C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",815,258,836,2.0,7/8/2016,"Usually never go to Cheesecake Factory, but decided to come here for dinner and ended up very disappointed in service. [WAIT TIME] Came here for dinner and the wait was about 40-45 minutes. Got to walk around Fashion Island to kill time so the wait didn't seem too long. [FOOD] - Deep fried mac n cheese balls: DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE. Perfect amount of batter, the mac n cheese inside was absolutely delicious! Creamy and cheesy, not dry at all. - Pasta Carbonara with Chicken: The garlic parm cream sauce was incredibly oily, and not creamy at all. The pasta was dry and oily, and the chicken was overdone as well. Definitely don't recommend it. - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: the spicy chipotle sauce was delicious, and the chicken wasn't overcooked in this dish! Would recommend it. I usually go for the classic cheesecake, but we decided to try the key lime cheesecake and the salted caramel cheesecake. Definitely LOVED the salted caramel cheesecake!! Would recommend that one or the classic cheesecake. [SERVICE] Once we were seated a server came up and took our drink orders. After she returned with our drinks we asked for a couple of minutes to take a look at the menu. When we were ready to order I tried to wave our server (or any server for that matter) down for a good 10 minutes. I was very disappointed at how inattentive they all were. Once I finally got someone's attention, we ordered. They brought out our appetizers immediately, but we waited another 20 or so minutes AFTER we finished our appetizers for our pasta dishes to come out. It also took a while to wave down a server to get the check as well. Will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20

Very bad start I know but food is ok but mash potatoes were cold and the bread as well.I had hibachi steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus.Now going back to the person who had me seated she made me wait for 3 Minutes for nothing because there was a plenty of empty tables and it was around 10 Pm which is late dinner on a Monday ( Not busy Daah)???!!!!

Stacy H.,"Orange, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Went ahead and ordered food to go approximately 2 hrs before they closed and verified and repeated my order to make sure that it was correct. Once I arrived in which was a 20 mins drive, I tried to check if my order was correct and the person whom attended me insisted me to not check it because it was ""correct and no need to do so "" . So I leave and 20 mins later after I arrived to my home I see that the order was completely incorrect. Meaning wrong entree's (we ordered chicken madera , and chicken bellagio) they gave us scraps of chick nuggets with fries and dried up shrimp with mashed potatoes  I drive back (another 20mins) and let them know and they said they couldn't redo my order since they had already closed the kitchen . This was 40-50 mins before the restaurant closed . I asked to speak to a manager since I saw people walking in to be seated and the stated that he couldn't assist me due to the same reason. I gave up at that point and asked for a refund instead and the manager refused because ""once the food is made it's non-refundable"" and as well because his register was also closed . After that a cook just gave money from his own wallet to tell me what they we doing wasn't fair .  I refused the money and left with no food and no money back .  I love Cheesecake Factory but after this visit I refuse to go back or have any of my family or friends go.

I asked the server what the heck happened - first he said oh fried food comes from 2 different kitchens , I replied that both our appetizers were fried - he shrugged his shoulders and replied  .... I just ring it in dude and walked away  The manager Lester came and asked what happened, we explained and he was very dissapointed !!

Anita K.,"ENCINO, CA",229,117,283,3.0,6/6/2017,"Came in at a busy time, but got seated promptly. On the flip side our dinner took forever to come out. The complimentary bread was extremely hard and crunchy, almost hard to eat. Wasn't the fresh warm bread that you would expect to come out at 6pm for dinner. No problem, we waited for dinner instead, and waited. My go to dish is their Sante Fe salad which was drenched, and drowning in dressing. It was the point that you could even taste the salad ingredients but just a sharp cilantro dressing. I was hungry to I ate it, no time to take it back and remake one when you've waited over 30 mins. My kids enjoyed their chicken strips and fries, with the best Ranch dressing on earth. No cheesecake this time but their selection is out the world. Personal favorite is Red velvet and cookie dough. Make sure to order light, and beware of humongous portions if you want to walk out without food coma, and want to save room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=20

Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",154,123,371,3.0,4/9/2016,Slow service. Probably some of the worst service I've had at this location. I waited a long long time for my food- at least 20 to 30 minutes. I ordered the hibachi steak which was very good. Totally surprised by that. Wasabi mashed potatoes though so- be aware. They are spicy hot. I like this location and the overall menu but the service on this occasion was pretty bad. It was almost impossible to find the waitress to get a drink refill. I saw a lot of standing around over by the kitchen so I'm thinking the kitchen was running slow? I don't know if that's a good excuse.

I eat here frequently because I work close by and I've never had a bad meal, I would typically hold off on a bad review for one bad meal but this was exceptionally bad. My husband and I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich to split, which is a pretty common order for us, and it was horrible. The sandwich was all bread and mayo, tons and tons of mayo, very greasy too - where is the chicken? There was hardly any chicken in the chicken salad - I think I had two pieces of chicken surrounded by clumps of mayo. We would have sent it back but our waitress vanished and we were starving.

Our server forgot to put in my order and my girls were practically done with their food before I even received mine. I am honestly still waiting and my girls are almost done which is why I am writing this now lol All I ordered was an appetizer Buffalo Blasts. The reason I know my server forgot my order is cause he actually walked over and said "" Are you ready for cheesecake?"" And I hadn't even gotten my food yet..I was like, ""Ummm, my buffalo blasts?"" And he said, "" Oh! Let me check on that."" When he came back he said, ""They had to make it fresh so that's why it's taking so long, like 8 more minutes?"" The only reason I said yes is cause I have been craving it for about 2 weeks AND I am 37 weeks pregnant. Not an excuse, but still. I think he could have done better, but maybe cause it was busy?

Our waitress was fantastic - nice, super friendly and chatty.  She was also attentive throughout the meal; filled our water glasses several times. I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad.  I think it's fairly new, but then again I haven't been here in months!  Unfortunately, there is no lunch portion of that particular salad.  The salmon was tender and beautifully cooked, and well seasoned.  The almonds added a nice crunch to the salmon.  The salad consisted of kale, arugula, Brussels sprouts, quinoa, avocado and dried cranberries, with a vinaigrette dressing.  It went well with the salmon, and I was very pleased with my selection.

Mackenzie S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",58,2,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for a long time, but I had such a bad experience here that I don't think I'll be returning to any CF for a long time. I'll be honest: I have to eat below 25g net carbs per day, which means dish modifications are basically a way of life when I go out to eat. After finding nutritional information online, I thought I had some great menu options that, with a few modifications, would fit my diet. Exciting! I settled on the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions, which normally come with mashed potatoes, wine sauce, crushed croutons, asparagus, and mushrooms. I asked for the dish without croutons, potatoes, and the sauce (all high carb, though I would've loved to eat them!), and I asked to swap another side - sautéed spinach - for my potatoes. I ordered the medallions medium-rare.  I wish I'd taken a picture to show you how my dish arrived, because it was honestly unbelievable that ANY restaurant would let a dish like that out of the kitchen. The five medallions were the size of quarters and so over-cooked that I could hardly chew them. Spinach was haphazardly thrown all over the plate, and the other sides were missing. Even when I asked for them to be brought out, they were quickly sautéed and thrown on the plate the same way. I got a pretty clear impression of the chef's thoughts on my orders - I was another bitchy customer ruining a recipe, and I didn't deserve the effort it took to put together a nice dish. Look, I know modifications are annoying. If I could find even a single restaurant that made dishes I could eat without any special requests, I would eat there every day of my life and never bother anyone else with my ""high maintenance"" diet. But man, how can any respectable establishment put out a dish like that? I would've rather skipped a meal altogether and stayed in my room than spend as much money as I did on such a sad meal. I'm still pretty upset about it, tbh.  TLDR; if you have a dietary restriction, look elsewhere for a restaurant that will actually respect your requests and still make you a dish that's not total garbage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=40

Service: I always have received very good service at this location.  The wait never seems to be too long, server comes to the table promptly.  And who doesn't love the cheesecake factory bread! I mean, right?   Food: For Lunch I like the Renee Special.  It is a ton of food, I can never even finish it.  It comes with a cup (the size of a bowl) of the soup of the day.  Today it was loaded baked potato.  This was so good, had bits of bacon, cheese and sour cream on top, awesome flavor. It also comes with a half sandwich (the portion is more like a whole sandwich), there are two choices, a turkey one and chicken salad sandwich.  The chicken salad sandwich is what I choose.  It comes with a side salad as well.  For $11.95 the price is right. For dinner I tend to go with the Crusted Chicken Romano.  I have been ordering this dish from the Cheesecake Factory for years now.  It is so tasty and you will have leftovers. It is a lightly breaded chicken served with a side of pasta.  The flavors are just right. Dessert: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is always my first choice.  They have a crazy long list of cheesecakes to choose from.  I've had a few but, I am a chocolate lover and always go back to this.   They have a new skinny menu with lots of low cal options.  I haven't had anything off this menu but I like the options.  The menu in general is very large and it can be difficult to choose, but nothing I have had here has been terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=40

Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1431,2127,3.0,10/4/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is just like yours except it boasts a view of the Pacific Ocean.  Ahhh, The Cheesecake Factory... no mall is complete without one, right? This location will not disappoint true fans as it features an extensive menu of various items dreamed up in a test kitchen with flavor profiles that will not scare old white people or children. The service is professional grade for the most part and comes with unlimited rented smiles both tableside and at the bar.  This franchise clearly believes in the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none approach as proven by the colossal menu featuring everything from Miso Salmon to Chicken & Biscuits, Calabrian Pizza, Carppacio, a Baltimore inspired Pit Dip Sandwich... You get the idea. I was a little surprised there were no Korean Barbecue influenced options, Banh Mi sandwiches or Macarons as all are the ""it"" items of test kitchens worldwide in 2015. Maybe next year? Then of course there is the 30 foot glass case worth of Cheesecake options, the perennial favorite of every suburban mother. Life doesn't get better than this.  Snark aside, The Cheesecake Factory is fine for what it is so long as your expectations are tempered and realistic. They are nothing if not consistent and you can do a hell of a lot worse (NORM'S in Bellflower).

Sebastian S.,"Newport Beach, CA",71,93,70,5.0,12/27/2016,"Out of every single restaurant I've been to around the world, Cheesecake Factory always remains as my go to place that I have to go to at least once a month. This is the first place I take anyone from outside the US that visits me and they always love it.  Many say CF is way overrated and that it has more items on its menu than it can handle. You either love it or hate it. But honestly, I'm in love with this place and have yet to try something on the menu that I didn't like. And of course, cheesecake being my favourite dessert makes this place heaven! Haven't found any other place that serves cheesecakes as good as this.  So the happy hour here is out of this world! There's heaps of different appetisers to chose from at super good prices along with discounted drinks. It's usually between 4-6 M-F and it's totally worth it. My go to appetisers are the avocado egg rolls and the factory nachos! Both of them are AMAZING!! Love how on the nachos, the chips are baked which really makes a difference in taste. I've also had the sliders and the buffalo blasts both of which are excellent as well!  If I come outside of the happy hour, I tend to get a burger or a sandwich but I've tried a good chunk of other items on the menu and they're honestly all really good. Basically anything you get, unless its on the skinny menu, is going to come in a ginormous portion so be prepared to take food home. You really can't go wrong with anything you pick.  And then there's the cheesecakes. The gorgeous, decadent, mouth-watering cheesecakes. Whether you like the food or not, everyone has to agree that the cheesecakes here are to die for and that no where else makes them as good as CF. For starters, they're just beautiful to look at. The presentation of every cheesecake is amazing and the taste is just as good. Every bite takes you to heaven. Yes, it's that good. My personal favourites are the Godiva (you really have to love chocolate for this one) , S'mores, Oreo and red velvet. I will say that the only one I can't recommend is the Chocolate chip cookie dough. Not as good as it seems. Otherwise, you can't go wrong. Don't like cheesecake? Try the Godiva brownie sundae. Thank me later :)  In regards to this specific location in Newport, haven't had any problems.

To be fair, I'm a  flipping veteran when it comes to Cheesecake Factory. Having dined at this establishment for over 10 years and counting, we are clearly obsessed with this restaurant. When it comes to food, we are addicted to their endless amount of food choices/drinks/etc.  Food aside, what I want to write a review about is the spectacular service we had this past Saturday. It was lunch, not a special occasion, just a typical meal. Shelly F. was our server and from start to finish she was on top of it. From the little things like making sure our meal was made perfect by our request and giving her opinion on certain dishes when needed....to hot towels (really??) to wipe our hands post meal and lastly, to-go beverages! Simple, easy to execute, but sooooo appreciated! She went above and beyond with the service, and I can honestly say I've never had better service in my life than with Shelly. Shelly you made my day!

Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",990,557,569,3.0,1/29/2016,"We have a Cheesecake Factory close at home, but its location is difficult for parking and although we have heard rave reviews - never visited. While visiting our friend, we decided to try out this Newport beach location and were impressed.  Here is why: As we entered we found ourselves surrounded with dozens of families waiting for tables and full tables as far as they eye could see - a rather grim sight when you are toting two hungry kids. To our surprise we were at the front of the line within seconds and handed a disk with a promise of a 10-15 minute wait ... and in 5 minutes we were seated!!! Still a little gun shy from the sheer number of patrons being served - we resolved that it would probably be quite some time before our orders were taken - or - we would see our food. Minutes after being settled in a waitress came to take our drink/appetizer order. We didn't time her - but it seemed like she walked into another room - was magically handed our drinks - and just had to return to the table with them ... it was FAST! We were ready to order when she returned (because we had been thinking if we didn't get our order in right away - we may never eat). Our food came, and it was a reasonable wait, not speedy fast and not super long...but the food itself was IMPRESSIVE! Hot, delicious, flavorful, large portions (had I I known I would have ordered and shared my meal). Then the waitress checked back several times, not annoyingly, to make sure we were happy, brought extra rolls & butter, refilled drinks, and even made time to chat a bit about where we were from --- ALL while giving the same service to others in her section. It was such a good visit we will try the one at home...  Oh yeah - we were too full to eat the cheese cake - so we took some to go - ate it the next day ... OMG good tiramisu cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=60
Barb W.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",95,118,24,4.0,12/28/2017,"Received a holiday  gift card for Cheesecake and was initially reluctant because I perceive this brand as a food mill for masses rather than a pleasant dining location. The entrance and hostess stand were bustling with lots of people waiting for a table. It took us 15 minutes to be seated, not bad.  Although there were literally people at every booth and table, the space is not cramped. Each table has enough space so that you can hear each other and no one else is on top of you.  The menu is extensive. The burger, lettuce wraps, and kids corn dogs were all really good and served quickly. Portions are huge! I suggest sharing, as the appetizers were even too big for a meal.  The server was efficient. He definitely had a churn and burn style - no time for small talk - but he got the job done.  Overall this was a great experience.

I came here with a friend to celebrate the New Years and it was nice that we had the chance to get caught up with life's endeavors.  As we sat and review the menu, service was just fine. We did take noticed that random individuals started to service our tables but that might be their thing to help one another. I took noticed of the butter plate for the bread having this weird random crust on the side. I picked it off with some effort but it gina Ly gave in to my fork prying at it. No biggie. When my friend asked for white rice with her dish, our server wrote it down and then began to take my order. When her plate came, it was brown rice. No biggie... honest mistake. They later came back with white rice... and something else on the side. (See pic) Looks like lipstick. We told our server and she said it's not it's something else. .... with further examination, it was lipstick. They said the'll bring another plate out but we passed on it. While restaurants may have slip ups here and there... it's no biggie. Just fix it and do right by the customer. When we got our bill, another server service us. Think I counted 4. Not sure what to ask of this at that point.

We are talking seriously mediocre salads at lunch time. The beets were canned not roasted as promised!! Eew!  I could see the indentations from the can on them!! Yuck!! I had the fresh vegetable salad with grilled chicken. It could more accurately be described as the ""Whatever Vegetable Matter Salad with refrigerated cold grilled chicken laid on top for an extra $4"". The grilled chicken had an unappetizing whang to it. (The large chicken salad in the refrigerated case at Starbucks for $7.45 is far superior) My meal was a real bummer!  At $15+ at the Cheesecake Factory I was hoping for something delicious and fun to eat.

Not even fully melted. The breading on the chicken slid right off at the slightest provocation. And the chicken itself tasted pretty bad. Even the side of fries was flavorless. What's perplexing is that my table even spoke to a manager type who dropped by to tell us about the extensive quality control. He mentioned how the managers are constantly testing the food. We watched as he informed a chef that his pasta water needed more salt. So if they were that hot on quality control, how did something as nasty as my chicken sandwich hit my plate?

We arrived with a party of nine, but because of the long wait (1.5 hours) with a party this big we decided to split our party so we could get a seat earlier.  As we waited for over 30 minutes we watched parties of four and five come in and get seated almost immediately. This was perplexing, as we have been waiting for a while to be seated. When we discussed the situation with the employee, she was very condescending and handled the situation very poorly. We were eventually shown to our two different tables.  As for the food: I always get the chicken belagio and have never been disappointed ... until this visit. The noodles looked and tasted as if they had sat out for awhile, there was hardly any sauce on them, and the sauce that was on them was not the same as the sauce I have had on it dozens of times before. It was simply substandard for this chain. My wife and I were very disappointed.  I think this location could use a new hostess and new chefs.

Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",571,246,208,2.0,6/22/2017,"Update: The response from Corporate was a bit disappointing. This review is for their takeout service. I called in to ask about their soup and salad lunch special ($8.95) and ordered from the choices I was provided by the associate. Upon picking up my order, I noticed that I was charged $19 for my soup and salad. When I asked about it, the cashier said rudely, ""This IS the lunch soup and salad."" I left thinking it was probably just a misunderstanding, but my coworker and I were both taken aback by the service we received. Unfortunately, the food quality was also disappointing. My $12 chinese salad was just chopped lettuce, chicken, literally only 2 mandarin segments, a few slivers of shredded cabbage (you couldn't even see purple in the salad), and an entire bag of fried wontons strips.  Overall, I was incredibly disappointed with this order and experience, as I usually enjoy dining in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach
Brizylla A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2283,203,351,3.0,1/26/2016,"I came here on a Sunday night with my best friend and it was EMPTY. It's weird because normally the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I go to are always packed and it's like a 30-50 minute wait. But luckily we were seated immediately.  This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than the ones I usually go to. But the view is pretty nice, and I think it's even better at night. So I guess that compensates for everything. I did notice a lack of servers at this Cheesecake Factory (I saw one server with 5 tables). Our server was nice, but she didn't check up on us as much as I wanted her to. And she did lag on bringing us our drinks.  My friend and I weren't in the mood for big plates so instead we just ordered several small appetizers and just shared it. We originally ordered some spinach and artichoke cheese dip but our server told us that they apparently ran out of it so we got some nachos with spicy chicken and a sausage and ricotta flatbread. I was actually disappointed with the selections of food we got. I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I love everything I order - pastas, sandwiches, and burgers but I wouldn't recommend appetizers. The nachos were a big portion but it was just a bunch of chips- not enough guac, cheese, sour cream nor salsa. There was barely any chicken on them too. I understand that nachos are not a healthy food choice but I didn't understand why the chips had to be deep fried- like there was actual oil dripping from the chips. I was also annoyed with the flatbread we got, it was too small- not really sharable size. I do have to say the Georgia Peach (alcoholic beverage) was amazing but more on the too sweet side. I'm willing to check out other appetizers (but not reorder the ones I tried during this visit) and return here since I am a loyal fan to Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=80

My sister ordered the Louisiana pasta, of which I thought tasted like cheese pizza in a pasta form, but the breaded chicken it's topped with is delicious.  I ordered the Pasta with Chicken and Scampi Sauce. The pasta seemed a little undercooked in one bite, but the chicken was moist and tender. The scampi sauce was a great and tangy sauce.

BREAD: The bread that was brought to us was warm but very chewy - which means that the bread was not fresh from the oven but was microwaved. MAC & CHEESE BURGER:  This was a mistake.  I shouldn't have ordered it.  Being an avid burger lover, I love to try every single kind of burgers that's out there, so I couldn't resist ordering this when I saw it on the menu.  A burger that I've never had before. But the mac & cheese was just way too overwhelming to be a topping for a burger.  It was SO cheesy and SO salty that the burger itself was completely lost.  You could have used the best ground beef patty and the best ingredients in the World and it didn't matter because I couldn't even have tasted it. I know people who love mac & cheese would probably love this burger.  But then, if you love mac & cheese so much, you might as well have a mac & cheese sandwich instead.  Seriously ;) PASTA DA VINCI:  The Penne pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and was topped with sautéed chicken, mushrooms and onions with a Madeira wine sauce.  The wine sauce was really good and the dish had a rich Madeira aroma. The chicken was a bit bland but not bad.  Overall, the dish was good but not great.

Less than half the restaurant was full and took them 1 hour and 45 minutes to seat us because for some reason they didn't want to sit us in a section that was untouched because supposedly not having a waiter to wait us in that area. I call bs because there were 3 bar backs that were standing around having such in depth conversations that they didn't even acknowledge half of our group standing at the bar wanting drinks while we waited but took the older heavier blonde lady 8 minutes to stop her conversation to then acknowledge us and when she did her response oh did you guys just want water while you waited? Like are you serious?! We're standing at the bar looking at the menu to order expensive as hell alcoholic drinks. Like no dumb dumb we wanted alcohol! But okay an hour and 45 minutes later they finally seat us and with only one waitress like really 14 people with waitress...? Okay. She never asked if we wanted drinks just had a bussed bring water glasses and bread and then went around the table asking our food orders.... wtf?! We had to tell her we wanted to order drinks and appetizers first before our meals and she seemed annoyed... really that means you get a larger check which in turn means you get a bigger tip?!?!

We drive all the way down the coast from Long Beach to visit here, and we are frequent customers. Tonight we took our friend who is visiting from out of state down the coast to birthday dinner here. We stopped at the beach to enjoy the sunset and listened to the waves. We took our time because we had looked up the hours on the website and it clearly stated that this location closes at 11pm on Sunday. We walked in at 10:06pm only to be told they were CLOSED! I asked for a manager and the guy went away and came back apologetic, but no manager. He said we could still buy cheesecake. We went to the cheesecake counter figuring we'd at least buy our friend a piece of cheesecake for her birthday. Nobody could be bothered to help us for another 5 minutes. We asked for a piece of cheesecake, one guy turned around, told us they were out of that one, then went back to what he was doing, with no intention of helping us at all. Finally, I decided to ask for a manager. I showed him the website info on the cell phone. He was apologetic, but did absolutely NOTHING about it. This is not the level of service or professionalism that I have come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Another couple had also been standing there waiting to be served. They were equally annoyed by this guy's obvious lack of manners. He sent us off to the Huntington Beach location with what essentially amounted to a shoulder shrug.  We asked the manager to call the Huntington Beach location since we knew it was going to take us half an hour to drive BACK to Huntington Beach, and we'd be arriving at 10:45pm.

Megan J.,"Riverside, CA",39,221,529,2.0,10/7/2015,"My husband and I were in fashion island and we had a gift card to The Cheesecake Factory, so we decided to eat here last night.  We came in and were seated shortly. I wished that things had been a little cleaner. It looked like the booth hadn't been wiped off after the last group of people left our table, so there were crumbs everywhere. There was also a bunch of food gunk inside my menu which was gross. Every menu should really be wiped down after every use to ensure that there is no food on it.  For my dinner, I got the margarita pizza and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the macaroni and cheese was very good. It could have used a little more flour for the cheesy sauce to be more consistent. It had a creamy thinner sauce at the bottom of the dish, and the cheese was stringy on the upper part. Overall, it was good though and served hot. My margarita pizza was okay. I wish it had been hotter. The crust could've been crispier. But I enjoyed it. My husband had the Old Fashioned Burger. He requested that it be prepared medium rare, but it was more like medium well to well done. He explained to our server that he was allergic to onions and garlic and we were told that my husband's burger was without any garlic or onion. I think there might of been some sort of seasoning in the burger patty itself though (maybe some onion or garlic powder), because my husband started to react as if he were having a mild allergic reaction. After dinner, we had the red velvet cheesecake which was excellent. It wasn't too rich when you split it. It was part red velvet cake, part cheesecake and had cream cheese frosting and white chocolate (served with whipped cream).  Our server was pleasant and got us everything we needed, however, towards the end we became slightly disappointed in him. We told him to use up the gift card and then to split the difference on the credit card (which I admit, can be confusing if you use the word ""split""). He returned it to us and the entire check had been split in half (half on the gift card and half on the credit card). We tried to track him down for a few minutes and we told him that we were very sorry, but we wanted the gift card to be used for the full amount and then we wanted the remaining balance on the credit card. When we asked him to please correct this, it was clear that he was frustrated with us and he responded with, ""Well you said to split it in half"" (in a frustrated tone). We definitely did not tell him to split it in half. I explained to him that we said to use up the gift card and then split the difference on the credit card. He corrected it and then just kind of dropped the book on our table and didn't make eye contact or say anything. My husband and I felt very awkward and weird that our server would get so frustrated with something like this.  I do not think we will be back to this Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=100

I tell him I have a pick up and tell him my name.    Michael proceeds to tell me that he will go back and look for it. As I am watching starts to input my order on the screen and prints it out on the register to be made. 15 minutes pass as Michael tries to help out 3 other customers in a slow fashion.    Michael eventually sees that I am starting to get frustrated for the long wait. He then looks at me then tells me that they forgot to make my food and it will be 25 minutes.(This was all said with attitude) I ended up telling him I did not want the food and left really upset.

She knew she needed to bring her top game because it's a special night for couples and she did not hold back. Thank you to the waitress and cooks for the awesome dinner and service.  The rating is less a couple stars only because of what happened before we were seated. We were buzzed to come to the front after 15 min so we could be seated but when we handed out buzzer to the hostess she took it and forgot about us. After waiting another 10 minutes we inquired about our seats and they had been given to someone else. A manager had to step in and find us seats.

Essentially a cheese covered chicken with mashed potatoes- still good. Tremendous portions. Also had the factory nachos - it was once again, decent. Can't forget the original cheesecake, that one is a dessert must. I ended up completely full, but too full. It was tough to drag my bloated self around the mall.

Sometimes a long wait. This chain has a huge menu so everyone in our party was able to get something. We enjoyed appetizers of artichoke dip, potato tots and stuffed mushrooms. Go for the mushrooms as they were served hot and tasted great. The tots were okay- deep fried and served with ranch or 1000 island dressing. Boring. And I didn't try the artichoke dip- no need as I've had it a million times before (to make: 3/4 to 1 c. quality mayo + 1 c.shredded parmesan cheese + 1 can (drained) artichokes in a food processor for a few seconds until pureed - for spinach add drained thawed spinach!). Drinks were good - hubby enjoyed his Manhattan and I had a Vodka Collins. Guests enjoyed wine and Cosmos. Dinner included mushroom soup and Cesar salad (gobbled down!) for one guest; hubby and I each had the cobb salad but one split between us would have been better (salad had lots of bleu cheese and crunchy bacon . . almost too much bleu cheese) and other guests enjoyed Thai salmon. We were too full for cheesecake (thank you God) but clearly that is the reason for their popularity. Overall a reliable chain and good choice for guests who's taste preference runs the gamut.

I prefer this location over the one over at Spectrum because the dim lighting makes it seem more classy/fancy. We wanted to dress up, and it seems more appropriate at this location because of the dim lighting. On Valentine's Day we came at 7:30 and waited about 30-40 minutes to get seated. It was packed and we were given these little devices that would light up when it's our turn to get seated. Pretty convenient, but I don't think you should walk too far with it. Customer service is great, but seating was cramped. It's most likely because it's Valentine's Day though. Food was excellent, no complaints there.

When I went to The Cheesecake Factory, I ordered the sample platter for the appetizer which came with a variety of egg-roll-like appetizers and 4 unique sauces which was very nice, and accommodated everyone at the table. For my entree I ordered the Steak Diane cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The medallions paired with the traditional mashed potatoes and mushrooms was very well executed and I would definitely order it again. For my drink (yes I'm mentioning my drink) I ordered A strawberry lemonade, meaning only one. I say ""A"" because when I finished the waiter never came to ask me for a refill, and I know I could've asked for one but the staff didn't fill any of our drinks when they were empty unless prompted.

Someone came out from the kitchen and told us our food was taking so long bc the kitchen had to remake my sandwich bc it didn't look right or something. If what I received was a remake I would hate to see what the first one looked like! My side of spinach was raw so I had to wait for the sautéed spinach which was over salted and unfortunately the best part of my meal. My sandwich was two slices of brioche bread (I thought the menus said brioche bun but whatever) with about 1/4 cup (at the most) of chopped chicken mixed with mayonnaise and a few pieces of shredded lettuce. The most pathetic sandwich I have EVER had at a restaurant. I know it's on the skinny menu but to charge someone $12 for this is criminal. They should just take it off the menu. I literally can't believe they even served this to me after making me wait and telling me they had to remake it!  Yes I ate it bc I was hungry and my husband and kid were done eating by the time I got my food.

Jae P.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,5,3.0,5/13/2015,"Went into cheesecake factory for dinner on may 10th. The wait was about 30 minutes. There were many people having dinners for mothers day so it was busy.  My server was Tara excellent service came back and forth refilled my drinks and did everything she can to give me satisfaction. Being former manager for many different restaurant , i could tell she was experienced and she worked hard she definitely needs promotion from being a server to at least a management position so she can teach the other novice servers i observed at the restaurant.   Food was somewhat not the quality i expected from cheesecake factory . I always get the meat loaf dinner plate. The meatloaf i got was cooked, not all the way through ti give that bit of crispy taste on the top layer of the meat and soft inside. It lacked bit of gravy . Mashed potato that i had was smaller about maybe .5 oz less than i would usually get.   For appetizer we had fried mac and cheese. The display of the mac and cheese was not the corporate standard i would expect from cheese cake factory. It looked liked just thrown on the plate. Overall food was about 7.5 out of 10  Restroom for me is important part of the dining experience. It should be clean and spotless. Restroom was not clean . I know it was a busy weekend. However restroom should be always clean . Spotless.   Three things needs to be good in my book to get a good score on fine dining status. 1. Customer service , food quality and presentation 3. Cleanness  Overall i gave 3 stars The customer service was wonderful thank you tara. And food was above average . However clean part failed . Management should be checked as well .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=140
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",602,677,1990,4.0,10/27/2014,"Say what you will about chain restaurants, but I love the Cheesecake Factory. I especially love the skinny menu they created because their normal portions are crazy big. The white chicken chili is delicious but what I normally get is their marghertia flatbread and the little house salad. It's the perfect amount to leave you satisfied and still have room to share a slice of cheesecake and some coffee. The dulce de leche caramel cheesecake is my absolute favorite, but the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is pretty darn good as well. It's really hard to go wrong with any of their cheesecakes.  Tonight my grandma wanted to come here and her and I split a sausage and ricotta pizza. They have it on the menu as a flatbread, but if you ask they will make it as a normal sized pizza for you. This location looks small from the corner entrance but once you walk past the hostess stand it just keeps going.

We were greeted promptly, and then on the way to the table the greeter decided to make small talk by telling us how bored she was tonight! She said she usually works weekends so it was a far cry from her normal shifts. Hm... I work in a very well known restaurant, if one of my greeters ever said that to one of my guests, they'd be fired!  We finally get to our table, all the way back in the corner, practically on top of another table (my husband pulled our table away to give us and the poor people we were basically sitting on more room).  Server comes solicits drinks, nothing in particular, no suggestions, so we opted for good ol H20! She asks if we want bread, YES!! The bread is so yummy...if it ever arrives to the table. We wouldn't know if it was yummy, it never arrived. But do you want to know who would know if the bread is yummy? The party of 20 they decided to seat right next to us, in a VERY empty restaurant. They had bread at the table before they even sat at the table.  Server comes back and I ask if the Skinny Shrimp Tacos are fried or grilled (I should have known but yes, I asked), she didn't even know the answer!! She had to go check and come back! Still no bread. I opted to order Shrimp Scampi instead. We also at that point asked for straws and even straws took 7 minutes to get. Still no bread.  Que me being SUPER irratated at this point. Find our server, cancel order, get the heck out of there and enjoy a delicious, quiet, meal elsewhere. Very dissapointed in Cheesecake tonight.

Inside: if you walk in from the shopping side,  you'll enter the front where you tell them the amount of people you have/etc. But if you entered from the outside parking part, the first thing you see are stairs. Really beautiful. However, this confused me because it was my first time there so once I walked up, I had no idea where to check in. I stood there for a few minutes before some one told me it was in the right. Lol. Overall, the interior is big and pretty. Nothing to hate about. Service: the employee were really nice.  I believe the waiter that helped us throughout the night was called Rick?  He was friendly and very understanding. nice fellow.  Food: (don't really remember the names so I apologize beforehand)            Got a combo which was Steak Diane with shrimp scampi with mashed potato, caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, vanilla bean cheesecake.              The combo was good but as usual, more mashed potatoes than steak and shrimp. The steak part was good. The sauce was delicious. The shrimp...was meh. I took one bite and bam, I felt full. I felt like the shrimp was buttered too much or something.  Not sure but the more I ate it, the more I didn't want to eat. Potato was ok. Nothing to really hate beside it taking up most of the plate.                Caramel pecan turtle was good. But it was a bit too sweet in my opinion. The vanilla bean was perfect though. Soft with both vanilla and cheesecake taste while the other cheesecake was stronger on the sweetness. But this is just my opinion.  Overall: this place is pretty and the service is good too. However, even though I enjoyed my dinner there, this isn't the place I'll continuously go back to.  I'm not really a fan of the food because it makes me full really fast (I believe yahoo news mentioned cheesecake factory's foods has one of the highest calories).

Everyone but my sister's food came out, and the waiter then said they did not have the ingredients to make my sister's salad. This would have been fine, except the rest of us already had our food. I find it hard to believe that they only realized they didn't have the ingredients until everything else was out.  My sister ordered a different salad, which took forever to come out. They gave my grandmother the wrong dressing on her side salad and no one came by to see if everything was okay so she couldn't return it.  Our waiter disappeared without saying a word after he told us they couldn't make the first salad, and we were left with multiple other people who came by occasionally, but not when we needed anything.  They didn't even seem sorry that they messed up, or offer to take the salad off the bill or offer dessert. Which was not what we were looking for, but it would have been a nice gesture.  Overall it was a bad experience. We've never had an issue like this before at other locations so it was definitely an upsetting out of the norm experience.

Cons: The prices and gratuity.

When it comes to gratuity and tips, I understand that servers get really busy and have to deal with all types of people but I don't understand why it's almost mandatory to give such a large tip.

The host was very friendly, but our server was not. He did not smile and seemed to dread serving us.

T P.,"Chino, CA",0,7,1,3.0,5/29/2017,"Visited this location yesterday with the family. Food was delicious and service from our waitress was good too. However, taking off two stars simply because the seating hostess who lacked empathy to my mom who was in a motorized wheelchair and asked us to put it at the front of the restaurant. Firstly, if she could walk that distance would we have not done that? Clearly she is in a wheelchair for a reason and needed it to get to the table and maneuver around the restaurant. Some people need to have better training and courtesy with people with disabilities. They are also patrons and deserve to not feel shamed when they enter your business with medically necessary equipment. When we checked in we requested a table that could accommodate this and we were told ""not a problem."" In an effort to not have a tiff in front of customers I guess the hostess backed off because I was completely angered when she requested we leave the wheelchair out front. We just moved the wheelchair to the side near an empty table. A family member was trying to move it to the side and the hostess tried pulling the wheelchair from the arm, which had i not told her to stop she may have broken it. Maybe she was trying to be helpful however at that point I just preferred she not since we were handling it. Maybe this location should consider some ADA complaint tables for people who require more ""space"" for their equipment.

Our glasses were empty multiple times, I saw her look at our cups, but yet still just casually walked by and ignored it. Once we finally got our food, we were missing silverware, so guess who had to wait until our waitress decided she wanted to do her job and bring us forks and knives!

Its a lightly breaded chicken in a lemony white sauce served with angel hair pasta. The sauce wasnt too lemony which is good because some places overdo it with the lemon. The pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken was very tasty. Overall it was pretty filling. They also give you bread with your meal to start you off.  My girlfriend ordered the lettuce wraps which had a Thai flavor to it. It was also very good and there was a lot of it. So of course I got to give her a hand I finishing it. :)  Did not order any cheesecake but next time I definitely will. Overall the price was more than reasonable.

We considered leaving at this point and should have as the service only got worse. He FINALLY brought us our drinks and then said he had to come back to get our order.

Courtney C.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",486,451,300,2.0,6/11/2013,"Meh. I felt the need to write a few 2 and 3 star reviews to counter balance my 4 and 5 star ones. The Cheesecake Factory immediately came to mind as a good ""meh"" place to review.  I'm definitely a bit of a health and food-quality nut so this review is definitely coming from that perspective. I also tend to not be a fan of inauthentic ethnic foods and places that try to do too much. The Cheesecake Factory falls into the negative bracket of all of these things to me.  The Cheesecake Factory to me is also representative of a lot of annoying American attitudes.  Attitude #1: More is better. More is not better in my book. More is wasteful. More causes obesity. The Cheesecake Factory's portion sizes are way too big. I say, moderation is the new excess. Embrace it!  Attitude #2: Quantity over quality. Lots and lots of food doesn't mean its all that great. Butter and salt are not a substitute for high quality food and legitimate flavor.  Attitude #3: Food-like products, especially diet ones, are a good way to lose weight. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Your body needs and craves legitimate nutrients. Not Skinnylicious salads with processed dressing and crappy meat.  I also just really don't like supporting huge corporations, so there it is. Support small-businesses! Support the Thai mom and pop shop giving you a real taste of Bangkok in your backyard or the 30-something trying to make his dream of owning a bar come true.

The novel -- I mean, menu -- is always a bit much to get through but you can't say they don't give you options. I chose the mushroom and chicken lettuce wraps from their ""healthier"" menu and they were good, filling but not too heavy. Nothing too remarkable. The four of us also split their pumpkin cheesecake and good lord. It was perfect. I guess you hope it would be though, they are a Cheesecake Factory first and foremost... Anyway, food was about a 3 but the amazing service took it up another level. I probably wouldn't come here all the time but it's definitely my go-to late night dining establishment from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=200

Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898,3.0,12/9/2014,"How I heard of this place: The first time I learned of the Cheesecake Factory was from my sister, Mojgan, years ago. This Cheesecake Factory is no different. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond . Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Upon being seated, I knew Mojgan needed an order of the Avocado Eggrolls ($9.95), so I immediately ordered those, and three glasses of water without ice, before even taking a glance at the menu. When my two dining companions took their seats, we also ordered the Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start. The Avocado Eggrolls, always a hit between my sister and I, served over a bed of crispy rice noodles, include avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper and served with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. The Buffalo Blasts, a new favorite, include chicken, cheese and spicy buffalo sauce all stuffed in a spiced wrapper and fried until crisp, served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. For our main entrees, my sister and I shared the Cajun Jambalaya ($16.95), the CFs most popular pasta dish! Shrimp and chicken are sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce and served over rice. Our dining companion ordered the Fresh Grilled Salmon ($19.95) with mashed potatoes and large spears of asparagus. For dessert, we left the ordering to our dining companion, who enthusiastically ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95), with moist layers of red velvet cake and the Original Cheesecake covered with special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting. He also chose the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake ($6.95), caramel cheesecake topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust. On a return visit, Wednesday, June 5, 2013: A new SkinnyLicious menu drew our attention with a Grilled Turkey Burger ($9.95), minus the bun: combined with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices, served with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo and a green salad, and a Turkey & Avocado Sandwich ($9.95): freshly roasted turkey breast, smoked bacon, avocado, tomato and mayonnaise on a toasted bun, served with a green salad. My husband continued his deep-fried frenzy with the Fried Chicken Salad ($13.95) complete with mixed greens, tomato and green beans, topped with grilled corn, glazed pecans and honey mustard tossed with a house-made Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. We completed our scrumptious late lunch with the new Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake: Oreo cookies baked in the Cheesecake Factory's creamy cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with a milk chocolate icing. What I loved: The two appetizers were absolutely tasty and full of rich flavor. The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style, and the sweet sauce over the creamy avocado rolls were the perfect start to breaking the second day of the Baha'i Fast. The salmon was soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, and paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus served crispy and lightly salty. I really enjoyed the spicy jambalaya, with marinated chicken and tender shrimp, fajita-style vegetables and full of flavor. Of the two desserts, the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake won my vote, even though I could barely eat more than two bites. Why I loved it: The portions are huge and the food consistent from Seattle to Las Vegas, from Orange County to Bellevue. Cost: Average ($9.95 - $19.95 per entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=200

My personal favorite is the fresh strawberry, because I am a basic bitch. But ALL of them are heavenly. In addition to that, I always feel hella swag going in there. The atmosphere is very refined for a place that serves fried mac n cheese, which essentially describes my personality. It is a bit pricey, but when you go you make an event out of it. The staff at this particular one are quick to answer, very efficient, and most importantly are very very nice! Especially the ladies at the front who get the cheesecake!

John N.,"Austin, TX",349,488,182,4.0,3/4/2013,"There are plenty of reasons Cheesecake Factory is not my first choice of dining BUT BUT BUT......but it is an ideal restaurant for the indecisive as well as the pricing for the portions that they do offer. I have been going for almost ten years now.  Before the skiny menu was offered, I left the restaurant due to how unhealthy their meals were, but they tasted delicious. My most recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory reminded me of the service, always friendly and offering many different selections.  I recommend aiming for any of their seafood dishes where extra attention is given to the presentation as well as choice of sauce to compliment the food.  Their seasonal swordfish is nothing short of amazing! TIP:  ONLY go for their signature cheesecake desserts if you are either planning on taking it home OR you ate a small meal and you KNOW you have room in your tummy for more.  Otherwise you will hurt yourself.  Too much food, not a happy foodie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=240
Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,3.0,12/11/2012,"Before this Cheesecake Factory, I'd only tried the ones in San Francisco, San Jose, and Houston. Decor is pretty much the same theme as the other outlets, but this CF is much smaller in size. Service was very friendly and fortunately the place wasn't too crowded.  I ordered the Lentil Soup and Turkey Sandwich lunch special. It was ok. The lentil soup was thick and hearty and really hit the spot. However, the turkey sandwich was a bit of a let down. I expected a whole lot more turkey in my sandwich, but it came with a very modest portion which seemed rather uncharacteristic of the usual CF portions. There seemed to be a shortage of staff attending to all the tables as I could see my waitress running from table to table taking orders and serving food. As such, it took me several minutes to catch her attention so that I could ask for the check. I've always liked the CF and will continue to frequent it, but I likely won't order the turkey sandwich again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=240

We both ordered pizzas, I had the spicy meat pizza and Jess had the goat cheese and veggie pizza.  Both tasted good, but I got a bad stomach ache that night. Jess had the red velvet cheesecake, which lacked much flavor.  I had the Reese's Peanut Putter Cup cheesecake, which was so-so.  I guess not all of the cheesecakes are as good as I thought.

She was a blonde woman working around 1:30 pm yesterday. Turns out that we didn't. We asked the bartender/server about the status of our order and all we got is attitude and a snotty response about it being Father's Day. Since we asked about the wait time, she should have answered us honestly in the beginning and not had attitude when her failure to do things became an issue. Food came when we needed to leave and we have her a credit card to pay for it. We watched her check every table before running the card and check a few more tables on her way back. She wanted to make us later than we were. She even commented to a couple of other servers than we had a movie to catch as to justify her actions.

Christine O.,"Orange County, CA",2,28,12,4.0,3/31/2015,"We went for for a co workers birthday after work. It was crowded but we were seated rather quickly. We started with a cocktail and skipped the appetizers to save room for the meal. 1 of the girls got Steak Medallions with vegetables from the light and fit menu, 1got a Veggie Burger, 2 had the Steak Diane and I had the Chicken Madera. The food was presented really well and it came out nice and hot. The only complaint on the Steak Diane from both girls is that it had a very thin gravy to it and it had a very strong distinct flavor of red wine vinegar so whether they use balsamic vinegar glaze as a finish I'm not sure but a very strong distinct red wine vinegar flavor came through. Because the gravy was thin it didn't stick to the steak. They both said that it was very dry but they didn't want to hassle sending it back. After they pointed it out to me I realized I had the same thin consistency of gravy on my Madera. Most of the time the gravy is nice and thick but that wasn't the case this night. The bread was good and the girls liked the wheat one the best but the white bread was very hard and was not warm at all which made it seem kind of stale. Tyson was an attentive server considering that he had a lot of tables to take care of. We had a Lemon Meringue cheesecake for dessert...Wow! I think that was the best part of the meal and I never do dessert so that says a lot! Overall, 4 stars as my meal was very good but the next day the girls brought it up again how the vinegar threw off their dinner and the steak was really dry. We had not been to Cheesecake Factory in quite a while as Yard House still seems to be everybody's favorite but I think Cheesecake's  food is good enough to give them another try.

I replaced it with the most mundane thing on the menu that the kitchen couldn't possibly ruin, but they managed. The burger was very dry, very cold and the kiss of mayo was replaced with a stack of red onions, dill pickles and the usual characters which I ditched. The wait had brought both ketchup and mustard which the runner picked up well before I got the burger. She brought them out again after the other parties at my table had already finished their appetizers and dinners. It took well over 1/2 hour later to get the burger but the manager comped that and took the mahi off the bill as well.

We walked in, and the cheesecakes were in the casing to the right of the restaurant. She's only tried the Original Cheesecake, so I told her ""Let's try the Red Velvet!"" We were sharing, so I asked for a slice of the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was rung up within a minute and received the cheesecake within the next two minutes. We brought it home and opened it up. Boy, it did not look like the red velvet I remembered. There are two layers of red velvet cake. Both layers were barely red or not red at all, but more brownish. We took a few bites and could barely swallow it. The cake itself was dry and the cream cheese in between the layers did not taste fresh at all. It seemed like the cake was made in advanced and was never put together until now? Or the whole cheesecake has been in the back refrigerator for a few days before they put it on the shelf. It was just awful. After a few bites, we ended up throwing 95% of the cheesecake in the trash. I expect more from The Cheesecake Factory.

Justin ordered the giant Belgium waffle, with pecans and strawberries. Justin was pretty disappointed in the lack of syrup and drizzle of whip cream.  Paige ordered the meat loaf sandwich, she said it was very tasty.  We topped off the early brunch with three orders of cheesecake, I ordered the pecan turtle, always a big hit, Justin had the new Hersey's chocolate bar cheesecake, he said it was great, and Paige order the Red Velvet, she said it was good!

One plus is that the service was good. The hostess (Lauren) was super friendly and set up a table for us right away. I didn't catch our servers name but she handled all 18 of us wonderfully. She was able to split our checks, was on it with the refills, and had a great attitude about helping us out.  I was in an indulgent mood so I ordered crispy mac n cheese. I love cpk (california pizza kitchen)'s version of this dish so i figured i'd give it a shot at cheesecake factory. i was very impressed with the portion size, but not with the actual food.

It's a good game to play when you are waiting 20 minutes for your buzzer to go off. Came here for a late lunch with a friend.  She had never had the avocado eggrolls, so I had to turn my vegetarian buddy on to these tasty bad boys.   I think every CF is the same interior-wise, dark wood and a lot of nothing really memorable.  But today, I had a view of the ocean sitting at what would have been a crappy deuce.  It seemed unreal, but I could see it. We sat in a section that had just gotten slammed, but our server was very communicative about what was going on.  My friend and I split everything down the middle, ordering the avo rolls, a caesar salad, and then the crisp apple streudel for dessert.  I love their warmed squaw bread, which is a really great treat since the wait is usually long.  So you can tear at the bread and smother it with butter like you've waited a lifetime for it.  The amazing, deep-fried invention of the avocado roll was pleasing as always.  Their caesars have always been a hit with me, but this time around the dessert is what sent me to the inevitable coma.   That sweet death was accompanied by a cup of freshly brewed coffee. It was the perfectly strong complement to the uber-caloric end. But thank goodness we did the splitsies with our courses, and actually the coffee was on our server who was ever so grateful that we were patient and non-attitude-in-ous with her. All that equaled to a super (mayber over-) satisfying lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300

Mary S.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,29,2,1.0,10/15/2012,"I must start by saying that the Cheesecakes and jambalaya, as well as the chicken and biscuits that I've had here are great.  This review is about the poorest service that I've ever received at a CCF in all of my days; and by all of my days I mean at least ten years.  My fiancée and I were starting to give up on chain restaurants because it seems as though they are really not giving two shizzes about their customers, but we had faith in the classic Factory. So we decided to go here one day for a late Sunday lunch, around 2 or so. It was unusually crowded for a Sunday at this time, so we waited about 40 minutes. Once we were finally seated, it took our dim witted server about ten minutes to come ask for our drink orders. Keep in mind, he was serving the table immediately next to us. Once he came to see us, he asked for our drinks and if we wanted bread (of course we do!). About ten minutes later he comes with our drinks and said that he forgot if we wanted bread or not. ""Yes please,"" I answered. Another few minutes go by and we finally get our bread, and order our food. I kid you not, we ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a taco plate.  FOURTT FIVE MINUTES LATER I have to remind him that we ordered a salad and tacos, and asked where they were. He said that someone should have brought it out already, and looked at us like it was our fault that no one brought us our food. First of all, its YOUR job to make sure that YOUR tables have been taken care of, not somebody else's. Second of all, WTF dude? I can't go make the food myself here, that's why I came and am paying you to do it. I'm tired. It's Sunday. totally unacceptable.  I have concluded that this kid is just totally unprepared and too incompetent to be a server on a Sunday lunch shift, possibly any shift at all, and if the management at this establishment doesn't figure that out soon, they will no longer have us, or any other paying patrons as customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300
Donald S.,"Newport Beach, CA",590,448,25,3.0,3/22/2012,"Ya gotta eat somewhere, right!?!? This was my ""somewhere"" a few weeks ago...I'm almost fully recovered now. I'm just kidding around (as far as you know), I probably didn't have any real problems with the food at the Fashion Island Factory. That's largely because I didn't order much of anything...between all the kids scampering around the joint, the super loud and hyper after work conversations fueled by too many mediocre cocktails and the strangely disconcerting 44 chapter book that they laughingly call the ""menu"", I pretty much didn't have an appetite. I know...crazy! We met several members of The Beautiful Carin's family, who happened to drop by scenic Newport Beach to help her celebrate her birthday! It was an interesting dinner, right from the outset. The waiter kept pressing our group to order...""I'll give you few more minutes"" as if it were an imperative that we be ready to spout our requests the moment he reappeared. In his 8 - 10 return visits to our table, we weren't ever ready. Honestly though, we are the customers...Simmer down Jethro...we'll order when we're damn good and ready...I know your CF waiters handbook says to move us along in order to ""optimize"" the table...but we are catching up with family and this is going to take a little time. Jethro finally resorted to essentially ignoring us (and I can't say I really blamed him), so he was ill prepared when we flagged him down and began peppering him requests. We want red wine...I want scotch...we want silverware...we want napkins...we want child's meals...we want salads...we want cheesecake...we want...well, you get the drift. Add in the fact that almost no one at the table was able to order any item from the ""menu"" without altering it in some way (really...17,374 items on the menu and we could not find anything we didn't want to change...well, except me...frenched fries and scotch for Donald, por favor). Not much of what we wanted showed up in a coherent manner...my fries (the only thing I ordered...hey, I've been to CF before...lots of them...I know what I want and, more importantly, what I don't want) showed up way before I got my cocktail. Water didn't show up until the 3rd or 4th request was made...tableware didn't show up until after food began to arrive...condiments never arrived (we finally took them from a waiter station). Kiddo meals showed up one at a time over a period of many minutes (and anyone who has ever dined with kids knows that when one kid gets their victuals, all the kids had better be getting their victuals). I'm pretty sure Jethro viewed us as a ""table from hell"" and we probably were...although we are fantastic tippers and he would have done well to respect that fact. Then again, I don't generally wear my lapel pin that says ""Take good care of me...I'm a big tipper!"" Still, CF sort of redeemed themselves with dessert...after all, this is a factory devoted to cheesecake...and god knows I love cheesecake! I grabbed my newly arrived fork and dove in...for exactly 2 bites...we probably should have ordered more cheesecake. I've made my bi-annual (as opposed to semi-annual) visit to the factory, so I'm probably good for a while. Although, since I only got 2 bites of cheesecake, I could be talked into dropping by again for a slice...as long as you're buying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=300

I thought I already wrote a review for The Cheesecake Factory and how I couldn't bring myself to finish my meal, or order another entree because there was a piece of saran wrap in my pasta... I took a bite, and felt something slimy in my mouth that I couldn't chew. I thought it might be an onion, but it was a piece of plastic - gross! The great thing about this incident is it shows how involved the manager's are in their service. The server apologized and offered to have a new dish made for me. I had lost my appetite, so I declined. Then the manager stopped by to apologize and make sure I was okay. She offered me a slice of cheesecake, I declined because I had lost faith for the night in anything that hit the table. What gets me is that they didn't remove the pasta from the bill. I ate less than half of it before I stumbled upon my little surprise, and had the dish taken back to the kitchen. I didn't realize I would have to pay for someone else's mistake. Other than that one awful encounter. The food is usually spot on, the service is typically okay, and the portions are oversized - good and bad thing in this world that keeps getting fatter. I probably won't go back for a long time, because there are so many better places out there. Oh, another negative - when my cousin was six years old, he ordered a virgin daquiri. They served him a regular daquiri, and when he told his parents he felt funny, they sipped his drink to find that there was alcohol in there. SERIOUSLY? You didn't notice the drink smelled like alcohol when you dropped it off in front of a SIX YEAR OLD? The manager apologized, obviously.

From that, you can get a couple of different things for like $5 each! Plus, it's not oversized so you can probably finish it all. I like their beet salad and the pizzettes, which are pretty decent in size. Recently, I tried off their separate menu, the salisbury steak ($13) which came with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy.

The rest are all the dishes Ive tried over the years.. -complementary bread: dive right in for the dark, brown bread with oat flakes on it! Its heavenly with some butter. -Avocado egg rolls: yummy!  - crab and artichoke dip served with sourdough bread:hated it! It was overwhelming and heart clogging. spinach and cheese dip: ehhh... -stuff chicken tortillas..its a lot on one plate. It is served with corn cakes..and is not comparable to El Torito's corn cakes. -factory burrito grande: muy grande! delicioso! -four cheese pasta: too cheesy..felt kind of sick after 2 bites. -Pasta da Vinci: Loved it! Different, but good. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: not a fan. everyone seems to love this dish, so it just me. -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: Bro and I hated it. Never eating this again. -Kobe Burger: not too shabby for Jen! -Grilled Chicken tostada salad: MASSIVE..couldnt see my mom's face for a bit. It was okay. And..the moment you have been waiting for... -Green Chile style Turkey burger: SOOO GOOD!! Very tasty! Turkey patty was grilled nicely! Their regular grilled turkey burger sounds amazing because it has everything that I love!  I dont know how J.K. Rowling wrote so many books, but this review tired me out!  Enjoy! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=280
Nick R.,"Austin, TX",8,54,12,5.0,9/10/2011,"Usually there is nothing to add to Cheesecake Factory. Great food, fair pricing and you should expect some time to be seated as it is busy as in every factory. Everything was just as expected. Fast seating, first bread basket within 5 minutes, food severed in time, friendly staff. You should really try the ""Orange chicken"" and for sure the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"" if this is your first stop at the Cheesecake Factory. It was really busy today but the noise was ok and we always had a waiter close to us. Highly recommend this location, great atmosphere and nice folk around you.

Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,10/7/2010,"Cheesecake Factories are pretty standard, but the unique characteristic of this one is the view. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Fashion Island Shopping Center, and you should definitely request a window table, to best be able to enjoy the oh-so-beautiful Newport day.  We ordered an old-fashioned hamburger with sweet potato fries, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and the BBQ Ranch salad.  The hamburger was pretty good, and the bun was delicious (almost like toasted garlic bread-y). The fries were disappointing to a SPF lover.  We ordered the pasta because we saw it featured on some food show and it looked amazing. It was pretty damn good. Too bad they don't have a lunch portion though.  The BBQ Ranch salad was gigantic and tasty, with about a hundred different ingredients, and hardly even ""good for you"". :)  CF is pretty expensive for what it is, but a good place to have a nice lunch every once in a while. I'd come back, but next time save a sliver of space in my belly for a niiiiice piece of cheesecake. Yum...  (Oh! I almost forgot... The bathrooms in this CF location were SO WEIRD - and not the good kind of weird. The floor, walls, and toilet are all black, and the bathroom is very dimly lit...

When it came, is was just slightly over-cooked and for the most part, wasn't bad. The GM came and asked how things were and we said the steak was just slightly over-cooked but it was OK. No - he said, he took it back and wanted to make it right. Granted this took some more time but the 2nd steak came back perfect. At the end of the meal, the GM came back to apologize again for the steak and said it would not be on the bill and to make it up for everyone, we each can choose any dessert we wanted and it would be on the house.

I give it 2 stars because I have eaten here before and not had a problem. We called during the week to see if we could get a reservation on a Saturday evening and gave them the date and time. They said they did not take reservations, but they would keep it in mind and we could call that morning. We called that morning to make call ahead seating for a large group and showed up over an hour early to put our name in. We waited for over 2 hours, an hour of that was after our ""reservation.""  The hosteses would not give us a time and were not very nice. I don't mind waiting, especially when it's a large party, but we were not told it would be 2 hours. We were seated after all 15 of us decided to wait inside. They seated us almost immediately after that.  The service was good for the most part. They had multiple servers at our table, which got confusing. They could only split the checks a couple of ways, so we asked them if they could split it in half in a specific way since we had multiple groups within the group and they split it in a completely different way. We are a very easygoing group so I was a little confused as to all the frustration with our group. Overall, they could have had better communication skills. The food was good, for the most part. There were a couple of people that wished they had ordered something else, but other than that the food was good. The cheesecake was the best part of the meal, though.  I will probably eat here again, but not with a group. Any group over 4 seems like it could possibly be an inconvenience. I will pick another restaurant at Fashion Island next time. We got a call a week later asking us where our group was for our reservation. We called two or three times to confirm it for the previous Saturday. But we thought they didn't take reservations.

So thumbs up for decor. However, I did feel like I was in Newport. There were several Caucasian servers; however, we got the one non-Caucasian server. I'm sure they looked at our little group (2 Asians and 2 ambiguous) not dressed as nice=probably will not tip well, so let's give them our ""matching"" server. :(  The service was just OK. I was more interested in looking at the bar area. It just had like a '20s vibe, which fascinated me. I just wish I had dressed a little nicer. The jeans and flip flops and uncombed hair just made me feel like I didn't fit in. I could be wrong, though. LOL!

Christina B.,"Westmoreland, NH",42,265,2,3.0,8/31/2010,"There are three very important lessons about food service I learned from Anthony Bourdain. 1. Never order fish on Monday 2. Food on a buffet is made from leftover crap 3. If the menu is too large and varied, everything will suck. Cheesecake Factory hits number 3 pretty much on the head.  Almost everything I've had is pretty bad.  I believe most of their appetizers are prepackaged crap just tossed into a deep fryer.  However, amazingly enough, they have one of the best chophouse-style burgers you can find.  Decent meat, well-seasoned, good bun with the requisite tomato-lettuce-onion.  Dab a little of their garlic mayo on if you're feeling frisky. We also like to come here because when it's not crowded, it's a good, relaxing place to take the hamkey.  It's not crazy loud if you get the right booth, and she has room to wiggle around before the food arrives so she doesn't get too impatient.  The servers have been really good with her too--the last time we went our server, Shelly F, brought out some banana slices and broccoli for her to nibble on.  Big thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=360

You can use it for a quick catch up session with a girlfriend, a casual date with your significant other or a quick catch up session with a big group of people.  The food is good, and reasonably priced.

Brooke C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",123,31,,3.0,5/12/2013,"I visited this location with my mom and my aunt on Easter. We sat in the bar area. Our server was Arianna. She was so helpful with everything and made a genuine connection with us. She came back to check on us multiple times and really showed that she cared that we were there and enjoying everything. I would give just Arianna 5 stars if i could, but unfortunately i returned this past weekend with my little sisters. We had just finished the color run and had been up all day and were very hungry. I came here because I was expecting to get the same amazing service that I had gotten previously. Unfortunately i did not. We sat in the bar area, again. Our server dropped off 2 drink napkins (there were 3 of us) and then left, without saying a word. Went back to 2 other tables and did not come back for a few more minutes. We then put in our entire order at the same time and did not see her for another 7 minutes. No drinks (which we got water with lemon, come on that does not take that long to get) and 2 appetizers. At this pointe we were starting to get very hungry and antsy because we had been there for at least 15 minutes and usually within the first 5 they bring the basket of bread. We hadn't even gotten that. Oh and did i mention she never even gave us her name. We watched her go up to 3 other tables and make sure they had everything (twice). And yet when it came to us she wouldn't even look our way.  I then talked to a manager about how disappointed i was, and the manager was not too friendly herself either. By the end of the visit, we had 4 different servers, only one of them introduced herself and took care of us like I expected.  This visit was by far the worst visit I had ever had and I was greatly disappointed  I am hoping at our next visit that we will be lucky enough to have Arianna as our server again, as for the other girl that barely acknowledged us....learn how to smile every once in a while, it will make your life so much more enjoyable and you won't look like a rude snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=360

Every CF I've ever been to provides the same level of average service, food, and decor. Accordingly, the price is moderate. I went with my girlfriend tonight, and ordered the Grilled Chicken Club. It had avocado, tomatoes, lettuce... you know, standard fare club sandwich. Like everything at CF, it was served in a ""Wal-Mart Lovin' Portion"", supersized. It also came with a small mountain of french fries. (If there's one thing CF nails EVERY time, it's fries. Of course, being the king of french fries is like being the king of special education, so I'm not going to give them a better review for it.) Our waitress was friendly, laughed at my terrible jokes (I always test my waitstaff to see if they'll laugh at terrible jokes.), and handled her overall workload well. She appeared to have many tables, so that's actually saying something. She was attentive, served the food in a timely manner, and kept our drinks full. The waitress gets 5 stars. The food gets 3. That's how we ended up with a 4-Star review. Dessert, of course, was a slice of Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which we shared. It was just about what I expected it to be. Good, but not amazing Cheesecake. The only reason this review even happened? The view. Holy crap, the view is amazing. My advice? Sit outside. There's a GREAT view of the Pacific Ocean. If you go at the right time of day, you'll barely notice the haze from pollution. If you're going to Cheesecake Factory, you probably don't need my review to know what sort of experience you're in for. I'm only giving this one extra-credit for location. And the fact that since it's Cheesecake Factory, they serve everything, so I can get what I want, and she can get what she wants - and we'll both leave without hating each other.

I called for a curb side take away. After being put on hold on the phone for a few minutes, a woman came on the phone saying they can't do curb side. She was very rude and short with me. I asked her why....her respond was ""I can't let the girl in the bakery leave the restaurant"". I tried to tell her I had 3 kids in the car and it would be a big production to drag them all up the stairs to pick-up our food. She didn't want to hear any of it and was quite rude and just said ""no"". I asked why do they offer curb side take away and even have parking spots reserved when they can't provide the services when needed???

The last meal to arrive was a salad of all things.  Things did not even start well when the waiter said there was no bread, and we had to wait 30 minutes before a single basket arrived.  The manager did stop by to apologize at some point and said something about a computer problem.  No offer however of a free dessert or anything to those who had long finished their meal.  In fact, they charged us for an ice tea we had sent back.  They did take that one off when I complained.  When the meals arrived they were barely warm, almost room temperature.

The skinnylicious burger is a smaller-than-glamburger, yet very thick burger.  It is delicious and filling which is nice for a diet menu. Our server Alex was really nice and attentive. We came at lunch time on a Thursday and had no wait.  The views are a good enough reason to come here on a clear day, as it has a GORGEOUS panoramic view of the ocean. (So does the P.F. Changs next door) Fashion Island is also a nice place to visit, but if you are here from out of town and have some money (which you might, if you are in Newport Beach) I would recommend one of the smaller chain restaurants like Brasserie Pascal, Great Maple, or even Canaletto Ristorante Veneto if you are looking for fine dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=340

Few pages of desserts etc. Hard to find the perfect thing with such a large menu, and it makes me think how fresh some things could be, if its so large they must prep much of it for the week etc. Also its a little pricy, my GF and me went for lunch, bill was 52 dollars, tipped an extra 10 bucks.

Fascist Island or Fashion Island location is very glitzy for us tourists from the north, so this added to the fashionation of the place for me. Recently, it was a standard visit to have a little burger. I believe they are switching to a new menu, but I did catch the Kobe burger of the same name-sake famous beef with some sauteed mushrooms and onions on a toasted bun. It was enjoyable. I tried the healthy  twist by skipping the fries and going for the green salad. Of course the dessert would have to be some kind of cheesecake. Check ahead for your favs to see if they are in stock for that day. I always like the fresh banana cheesecake. I have to be biased that this location in Newport beats any other Cheesecake factory elsewhere here in northern California.

It brought back memories of the great burgers I got at the Beverly Hills location in the early 1980's, though the burger is a little smaller and less fries than before (Ok for me. Still plenty to eat) Cheesecake Factory is consistent in food quality and presentation. Another reason I like to eat outside at CF is that it is much quieter.

Brit S.,"Westminster, CA",110,39,3,4.0,8/5/2012,"My husband and I came here after watching an 11 am showing of the Dark Knight Rises. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in general so I was looking forward to eating. Our waitress, of course, was very polite and seated us quickly. It kind of seems like they're starting to change up their policy on the bread they give out. They used to bring it out immediately as soon as you sit down, but the last numerous times we've had to eventually ask for it once we saw they weren't going to bring it out. Anyway, I ordered my favorite dish which is the Luau Salad. When they brought it out to me I found a hair on my plate! I kindly asked the waitress for a new one and she quickly whisked it away, apologizing profusely. My husband had already gotten his food, which was also a sald, so I started eating his and we decided we might as well just share that since he wasn't going to eat it all. So I flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel my order. Another waiter came over and offered to give us each a bowl of clam chowder on the house to make up for the hair debacle. I was even more impressed when the manager came over and offered his most sincere apology and offered to also give us an entree to take home on the house. I couldn't belive how much they bent over backwards to make up for something that wasn't a big deal. Everyone has hair and I'm sure I've eaten my fair share! But they were so polite, apologetic and eager to make it up to us which made me very happy. Most places won't go so far out of their way, but this place did, and I applaud them for it. So we ordered a pizza to take home to the kids! Overall, I was very impressed with the management of this restaurant and I would definitely go back!

At this location it took us a while to get seated, but we had a nice view of the parking lot.  The restaurant itself was pretty big.  The decor was elegant.  There were a lot of people eating there, but we were seated in a section that wasn't so busy.

There were only 4 of us.  I ordered a salad, and the other people in my group ordered a sandwich, fish tacos, some seared tuna and a different kind of salad.  We got our drinks right away and didn't see the waitress since she brought us our beverages. We were about to leave some money on the table for our drinks and just leave because the waitress didn't come back and it was half an hour since we last saw her.  Just as we were going to get up and go, she came by and dropped some bread off.  She said that the orders should be right up.   We looked around and noticed that everyone else that surrounded us already got their meals.  It was pretty annoying.

Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1252,506,242,4.0,9/2/2009,"When most of the chain restaurants, as far as I'm concerned, have been going down, down, down in overall quality, Cheesecake Factory seems to be holding its own. Rating a particular Cheesecake location, for me, is tough, because I travel quite a bit, and have eaten at several throughout the Western states. The Newport location.....? Outside of a bad day, bad visit or bad kharma, it averages right back to being a 4-star provider. I travel throughout the Western US, and to name a few, have eaten at the CF in Tigard, OR, Marina Del Rey, Tyler Mall Riverside, Irvine Spectrum, Huntington Beach off the 405, (just last week), Mission Viejo, and Mission Gorge (?) off the 8, in San Diego, and Newport Beach, just to mention a very few. And when in Scottsdale recently, at the Grand Luxe.... which is an ""upgraded version in the CF restaurant family."" My 4-stars really goes to all the CF's I've ever visited. I must be lucky, because I've yet to have mediocre to poor service at any of their locations. My favorite menu items right now? I like the stuffed mushroom appetizer in that cheese sauce, followed by the chicken madera and BBQ chicken salad or Santa Fe salad. I find it's great to split the chicken and salad entrees, as the chicken usually comes with two breasts and plenty of potatoes. The full salad portion is huge. The only downside for me at CF is the cheesecake. I bake cheesecake, and am always ready to try someone's ""best ever cheesecake."" Last time I tried the NY lemon cheesecake (plain) at the Tyler Mall location, I was totally depressed. It wasn't  deserving any kudoos, and actually tasted store-bought. Unfortunately, for me to properly rate their cheesecakes again, I'd have to do a taste testing of all the flavors. That presents a problem. Either I'd get type II diabitis in the process, or somewhere in week two, I'd develope ""chubby finger syndrome"", and either the pen would continually fall out of my hand, or my ""cheesecake fattened digits"" would continually hit 3 to 5 keys at once on the computer keyboard......... either way, the review would be inaccurate and/or would never get done in a reasonable period of time.

Some favorites: Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Madeira, and Chicken Bang Bang. Most plates range anywhere from $12-$25. They're lunch specials are pretty much the same offerings at dinner but for a slightly smaller portion and cheaper price. Now, if you want  a good deal...check out their happy hour from  4PM to 6PM Monday through Friday. In regards to food, this is probably one of the best happy hour deals in town! Full-size appetizers that normally cost $7-$10 will all be $5! Such items include avocado eggrolls, spinach dip, shrimp summer roll, made to order guacamole, Tex Eggrolls, fried calamari, nachos, sliders, etc. There are so many mouth watering dishes to try but it is an absolute must to get the sweet corn tamale cakes...as Maria T. described it...it was orgasmic. Sweet buttery corn cake with a savory mixture of avocado and tomatoes. Another noteworthy dish was the fried chicken sliders, tasty soft buns and crispy on the outside, most on the inside chicken! $5 specialty cocktails, select wine by the glass and well drinks are a great option to wash down the mound of food you'll devour.

Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",701,105,63,4.0,4/25/2010,"I used to come to this Cheesecake Factory EVERY Friday night way back when I used to work down the street at Bandera. It's the only restaurant still serving food after 11pm and for that it gets 4 stars.  The good thing about late night dining, no wait...the bad? Even though there aren't that many occupied tables, the service seems to be on the slower side...I guess I can't fault them because I used to work in restaurants and knows what it's like after a busy night. There is one particular server, I don't know her name but she must be on speed or something because whenever I went and she was working, the service would be top notch. On to the food...if you've learned one thing from my other reviews, it should be that I am something of a creature of habit, I tend to order the same thing and rarely stray. At the Cheesecake Factory, I almost always start with the chopped salad as an appetizer (with Bleu Cheese dressing instead of the vinaigrette it comes with). This is my 2nd favorite restaurant salad (first being the Macho salad at Bandera). It must be the bacon and bleu cheese that makes it so awesome...it also has copped pieces of apple in it which I don't really care for but it contributes to the overall texture of the salad.  In addition to the salad, we'll usually get the artichoke & spinach dip...also very good, still not the best but good nonetheless. Having been here 1,000 times on Friday night, I can tell you that the special for Friday is always the same thing, it's never changed...it's been Mahi Mahi for as long as I've gone and that is what I get. You can get it simply grilled, blackened or Mediterranean style (on a bed of mashed potatoes). I've tried it all three ways but prefer it blacked with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli or sauteed spinach. I have on the rare occasion strayed from these items, I've tried some of their burgers which were decent, nothing to write home about but filling and good. I had the fish tacos which were fine except for the fact that they put Mandarin Oranges on them...never seen that before, I pick them out because I forget that they come with them.  With the name Cheesecake Factory, it's safe to assume that their signature dessert item is...Cheesecake. They have quite the list and I've not tried them all. I like the Oreo or Godiva chocolate cheesecake which are both available year round but my ALL time favorite is the pumpkin cheesecake which is only available around Oct-Dec. Word to the wise, it sells out pretty fast too so get there early in the season (I learned this the hard way).  Overall, I like the Cheesecake factory because it's convenient and has a pretty eclectic menu...usually a wide selection results in poorer quality (don't know why, just how it is) but the quality is actually pretty good and the food is consistent between locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=380

During the busy times space can get a little cramped if you dont have a booth, but it's not too bad.

Dru C.,"Orange County, CA",658,833,2262,3.0,4/10/2009,"If you go to a Cheesecake Factory and your waiter speaks with a semi-fake half French and Italian accent, you've undoubtedly just entered the Twilight Zone. On a recent visit during lunch, our waiter was a poor man's version of Jean Phillipe, the maitre d' for Chef Ramsey in that show Hell's Kitchen.  He would use wild hand gestures to introduce and over-emphasize the specials, which was just fish and soup. He had a slight snooty attitude, but at the same time was very friendly. He even had the black, slicked-back oily hair. The only thing missing? Food with fancy names. So I decided to go with a semi-fancy name on the menu and ordered the Chicken Costoletta. To be honest, I had never heard of this term but when I read the description, it sounded vaguely familiar. Three large tender pieces of chicken, flattened with a meat mallet, lightly breaded, then fried to a crisp golden brown. When it was delivered, the waiter even said ""bon appetit."" On the side is a huge mound of mashed potatoes and several sprigs of grilled asparagus. What made the dish pop with flavor was the lemon-y citrus-infused sauce beneath the chicken. A few dips in that sauce, and everything just tasted... A-OK. The waiter provided good service, almost too nice. He even said ""my lady"" multiple times to the only woman at our table.

Jennifer A.,"Valencia, CA",125,170,53,4.0,2/12/2010,"I had a major craving for some of their Small Bites last night. Cheesecake Factory, like any decent chain, gives you consistency. The food is always the same, so when I find something that I like I tend to crave it. I went, got a glass of wine (Raven's Head Zinfandel, I love it!) and a few small bites: -Fried Artichoke Hearts -Shrimp Scampi Crustini -Stuffed Dates -Beet Salad And yes, I ate it all... Fried Artichoke Hearts come with a tasty mayo dipping sauce. It's a breadcrumb type of breading, which I wasn't too keen on. It was kind of thick and the hearts were kind of small (yet the breading doubled their size). -1/2 star Shrimp Scampi Crustini had an amazing sauce, I loved the toast it came with. But the actual shrimp, not so much. They were kind of tough, but the sauce more than made up for it (I wish I could have a whole bowl of that sauce and the toast!). -1/2 star Stuffed Dates were AWESOME. My favorite thing all night. Next time I'll probably just get two servings of this, a small salad, and call it a day! They were gooey yet firm. Not too salty and not too sweet. Yum yum. Beet Salad is always good. Well, I'm a huge fan of beet salads, so I'd like this no matter what it came with. Not a huge fan of the microgreens it's served with, but they have huge chunks of beet and lots of tasty goat cheese, so I suffer through my green veg. Service was pretty spot on. I think my server either went on a break or started training someone, because partway through she introduced some other server and told me they would both be helping me out. Whatever it was, it worked out fine. I'm a pretty low-maintience customer anyway, but my courses (I got two small plates first, followed by two more) were timed perfectly, and my server(s) were annoying or anything. The main server I had was Kim, and she was funny and helpful. I even heard her with her other tables and she had such a bubbly and fun personality. I would totally go again and ask to be put in her section. Parking can be kind of annoying, and I hate driving to Fashion Island, but this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my house, and I am VERY happy that it treated me so well last night. :) PS: Chicken Picatta is tasty too, just didn't want an entree last night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=400

We were not in a corner, there were a bunch of staff passing by us so we both tried to catch a waiter's eye for another 5 minutes. They were not slammed, they were reasonably busy but really not rushed off their feet. We decided to give them a few more minutes and ultimately decided to walk out. Not something I have done too often. Whilst I'm perfectly capable of getting up from my seat and approaching a waiter and asking for service, I don't think I should have to fight for attention in a restaurant.

Couple that with pretty decent grub in some pretty good sizes at really decent prices to make for some great post movie late night dinner grubbing. So overall that's 3.5 stars (since the food while good is never anything to write home about). The extra star? The layout and look of this place.

Natalie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/1/2012,"I went there yesterday with two people. It was a busy Friday night, we went in at about 7:15. The hostess said it would be about a 30 minute wait - totally fine. It was busy. She gave us a pager and after 20 minutes, the pager went off. We gave her the pager and she asked us to stand in line behind a few other customers and assured us that a hostess would seat us in a minute. Someone else turned in their pager and got in line behind us as well. It was a good five minutes before a hostess came back and sat the people that got in line BEHIND us. I work in customer service and HATE crabby people that don't understand the nature of the business and that we literally do everything in our power to make the customer happy. BUT, to seat someone that got there after us (with the same number of people in their party as us - 3 people) is pretty ridiculous. Not to mention, we waited in line for another six or seven minutes until finally being called. WHY BUZZ THE PAGER IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEAT ME RIGHT AWAY?????  If you buzz the pager, we think we are about to get sat, so that is a lame system that you have there Cheesecake Factory! The server was very sweet, she passed us three times telling us she would be with us in a minute. No problem, I'm glad she acknowledged us and didn't just leave us to sit there waiting and wondering where our sever was. She took our drink orders and entree orders. I ordered a salad to start.

Our wait was about 30 minutes... pretty much on the dot. But it was somewhat of a surprise mind you that the rest of the center (Fashion Island) was dead... on a Saturday evening... by time we were finished with our dinner, exited the restaurant, all the shops were closed! This would have been about 8:30 PM. Economic Crises I guess? Even for Costa Mesa?  So were were seated, hostess was nice, few moments went by after looking over the menu (We're Cheesecake Factory veterans, so we know pretty much what they serve, what we like, love, and have been meaning to try) Blonde server came by, took our drinks, needed another moment still to look over the menu (nothing sounded appetizing!) And yeah, I can usually tell when service is going to be one of those... she just wasn't into us maybe.  So I ordered fettuccine alfredo with sun-dried tomato, with green salad, dressing on the side, no beets! (That's just weird) My wife ordered the beer batter fish with green salad, dressing on the side.  Salads came out, dressings on the side... not enough dressing for the stupid huge salad, next time we'll have them toss it in. En tress came out, mine looked very good; I ended up finding an appetite for pasta. My wife's fish came out. Looked good (Always a fav.) Server didn't bring ketchup for fries, malt vinegar, and the kitchen didn't put any tarter sauce on the plate.  So she asked for all three... Well that seemed like such a chore for her. Ended up bring the tarter sauce, malt vinegar, no ketchup. Asked again, she looked at us like we were bothering her.  Well, fettucinni was a little too dente... I think even for al dente it was hard, no taste whatsoever, (as Jason Y commented!) chicken was tough (Cheesecake's chicken breast usually is too, no matter when we've been). Got the most flavor from the damn sun-dried tomato's)  Wife's fish was plain as plain goes, even the coleslaw was coles-blah!  We ended up eating about half of our en tress (Server never came by again until my white sauce was near curdled eww) When she finally came by, she took our plates. I was expecting her to notice our pretty full plates and ask if we enjoyed our meals or not. I think a good server would have noticed. I ended up telling her everything was flavorless. She offered to have the manager come over. I declined, she insisted... I knew what that meant....  ...

The first few times I came here, I stuck to the chicken lettuce wraps as I didn't believe there would be anything better.   After years of not having gone here, a friend convinced me to go one night and we ordered Chicken Piccata and Pasta da Vinci.  Those dishes do not disappoint.  The Chicken Piccata has a creamy lemon sauce topped with capers and served with angel hair-a perfect combo. The Pasta da Vinci is perfect for those who love the Madeira flavor. Since then, this place has got me coming back and always for something different.  They used to have a spaghetti w/ pesto but for some reason, it is no longer available.  That was one of my favorites. Crusted Chicken Romano is very good if you're craving that rich crispy parmesan flavor.  Can't forget about the appetizers: 1. Ahi Carpaccio-pricey for the amount you get but definitely worht it. 2. Salmon firecracker rolls-a definite must-have if you're craving something bursting with flavor and spicy-ness 3.  Stuffed Mushrooms-it has the Madeira wine flavor and is bursting with goodness! 4. Fried Macaroni Cheese Balls-not one of my favorites but it is pretty good if you're craving some greasy junk food. Top salad: Santa Fe Salad--may i add, it may as well be a meal for two! Top Drinks: Georgia Peach and Pomegranate Mojito....actually, all their drinks are pretty good!

Yui S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",10,161,1,5.0,6/16/2008,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory I have tried out of the ones I visited in Brea, Irvine, Huntington Beach, Riverside, etc.  It's the BEST one yet! I always come here to enjoy a salad and sometimes the soup.  If I'm not too full, I enjoy a dessert.  My BFF likes the Kobe Burger with fries and an order of Iced Tea. First off, the wait at this place isn't very long.  Even when it is busy during mid afternoon on a Saturday or Sunday, the longest we have waited for a table was about 10mins.  Other times, on weekday nights, we always get seated right away. Service is very good.  They usually come take our order right away, busy or not, and our food comes out about 15-20 mins. after we sit down.  I usually order the Chinese Chicken Salad when I go to Cheesecake Factory.  The salad stands up above all the other Chinese Chicken Salad at other Cheesecake Factory because the chicken is never dry here, presentation is beautiful, they give a lot more salad, the waiters and chefs can follow directions and pay special attention to requests (I always want my salad dry with dressing on side--no sprouts and green onions and substitute with eggs and corn..yes, I am picky). I can't personally speak for my BFF and his Kobe Burger, but he seems like enjoy it each time we go.  I believe he gets it a little pink and I've never heard him complain about how the burger is too dry.  The burger seems like a great portion for the price and many times, he doesn't even finish his burger and need to wrap it to-go. The servers are constantly refilling out drinks!  And always comes back to check up on us, making sure we are doinng alright. Desserts are delicious!  Their strawberry short cake was pretty good-- it is basically a globlet of FRESH strawberry (they were in season) with Vanilla Icecream and instead of using short bread, they use more of a wafer cookie (they put 2 large ones) topped with whipped cream and drizzled in strawberry sauce.  Yum!! The Kahlua cheesecake is also good.  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, but I love the coffeebean smell they have when they use Kahlua to bake with the cheesecake.  Get it A La Mode! One warning about this place.  If you go on a weekend and it looks really packed,  make sure to request for a booth if there are only 2 of you guys.  If you don't mention it, they will place you in between two other small tables and you will have no room to move or even place your handbags.  It's really uncomfortable.. other than that, I love this place!  I come here at least once a week and am never disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=420

And I'm sorry, but the food has never really done it for me.  There are plenty of things I think are ""fine"" but nothing that would march me across Fashion Island just to have it.   It seems like most items fall just short of interest for me.  Something looks allllmost good...but not quite.  Maybe it's just my wonky eyes.

The expediter had a very long beard, like a little less than a for long, he looked like a clean guy and I have nothing against facial hair, but it was not appetizing. Our waitress also had what looked like a small red sore on her nostril which was also unappetizing. Fourth- the window shade was insufficient and sun was in our eyes.

Fast forward to last Saturday, and while the view is still spectacular during the day, I'm not nearly as impressed with the food. We started with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which is probably one of the best items on the extensive menu.  No complaints here. For my entree, I had the shrimp and crab salad, which is CF's version of a Louie salad.  The seafood was good, but the whole thing was smothered in Thousand Island dressing, so after a while I felt like all I was eating was dressing on hearts of romaine with some under ripe slices of Roma tomatoes.  I definitely couldn't taste the crab under all the heavy dressing. BF had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  He thought it was going to be spicy, but it turned out to be very sweet, and completely covered in toasted coconut.  It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again, and neither would be.   The bill for the appetizer, two entrees, and two cocktails came to $67 before tip.  Interestingly, his bottle of Fat Tire was $.50 more than my specialty cocktail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=440

Nikki P.,"Orange, CA",171,118,21,2.0,8/3/2010,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years now. I had to have been 10 years old my first time at this location. I used to love it, was my fave place to dine. I had quite a few of my birthdays here from 16 up until 20. Is it me or it that when a place is open for a while, the longer it's open the worse the service gets. It's like they stop trying. The wait has always been long. I suggest you get there early because guaranteed you'll wait at least 30 minutes. Then seating is another issue. It's crowed. If u sit in the middle I hope you don't mind dining with strangers. Service seems to just get worse. There's nothing worse than having a fake waiter or waitress.  So far the review isn't going so well for this place but oh it gets worse. So on my 20th birthday I went to this Cheesecake Factory. Of course had to wait about 45 minutes before getting seated. Shortly after I was upset because the wicker chairs snagged my dress. I didn't let it get to me though. So we order and we get our bread. I grab my knife and I look over at my silverware and to my suprise there was a huge disgusting chunk of food on my fork. So no biggie whatever, I was grossed out but didn't want to make a bug deal out of it. So the waiter just brings me out another one. I check it and there's food on that one too. Ugh so gross. It was not dried up food either it was disgusting looking soggy food. The waiter comes back apologizes and gets the manager. What does the manager do? Gives me two free deserts. Really!? Really now!!! We laughed finished our food and said keep your measly desert we're never coming back here again.  Food was Luke warm. Service was horrible. On top of that we were not pleased with how the manger handled that situation.  So after that whole ordeal I decided to give it another shot after a coulple years. So 23 I go back and service was a little better but I was not satisfied. To my disappointment it's just not the same. Not sure if they are under new management or what but it was a bad experience. I went there recently for a friends birthday and it still is the same.  I suggest getting a window seat if possible. There is a beautiful view. I'll give this location that much but overall not worth it. I will not be coming back to this Cheescake Factory.  If you agree with me then try going to the one at The Irvine Spectrum. One at Bella Tera was good when it first opened but service and food quality is starting to suck. Best bet us to go to the one at the Spectrum or to wait until you go out of state.

We were seated at a good spot. The waiter took our orders for appetizers (Thai Lettuce Wraps and Avocado Eggrolls) and were served a few minutes later. The waiter should have given us a much bigger plate and not leave us with just a bread plate. The waiter then introduced us to a new server, Marissa, because his shift was over. For our main entrees, my older daughter ordered  Fettucini Alfredo, I ordered Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, my other daughter ordered Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes which my sister in law ordered too. My husband ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries. Halfway into our dinner, my husband's order hasn't arrived so we called the attention of Marissa who profusely apologized for the error. A few minutes later she came back with the order but brought the regular french fries and not the sweet potato ones. She apologized again and the fries came back at a much later time which the manager brought to our table. We kept our cool because Marissa was apologetic anyway and then the neat thing was she told us that my husband's order was on her including a free dessert of our choice to go (I picked Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake). We saved almost $20 for their error. It wasn't a bad experience but not a good one either because we could have responded to Marissa rudely but we chose not to for obvious reasons. We gave her a tip of 15% only because of the error she made :) We usually go to their Irvine Spectrum location for family dinners but we chose their Fashion Island location this time because of the distance from UCI where graduation was held.

Royce Y.,"Fullerton, CA",205,216,7,4.0,9/2/2009,"OVERALL RATING = 8 / 10 Overall FOOD = 8 What I had:      House Bread = 5      Avocado Eggrolls = 8      Farfalle w/ Chicken & Roasted Garlic = 9      Miso Salmon = 8 Drinks:      Water = 5    ATMOSPHERE = 8 SERVICE = 7 ---COMMENTS--- Went w/family for lunch. My wife claims to love their house bread as one of the best. I don't quite agree. It's good, but I could name so many other places with more memorable bread. The avocado eggrolls does compete with the ones from BJ's. My wife prefers these ones more because they load the avocado in each eggroll and they're crispier. I agree with the crispiness aspect, however, CCF's Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce, though it wasn't bad, doesn't compare to BJ's sweeter Tamarind sauce. Note: I learned what Tamarind was today. Interesting that both places pair their Avocado Eggrolls with Tamarind. Seems like someone cheated off the other one. The miso salmon was so thick and juicy. I was surprised we would get this quality of salmon at a place like this. The miso sauce, which was kind of strong, in a good way, went very well with the buttery-ness of the salmon. It's too bad the only other thing they serve with the fish is a bed of rice, which was decent, and 5-6 snow peas. I should write Evelyn and ask her to throw some steamed brocolli on top or something. My wife LOVES salmon and thought it was great, but got tired of the the taste and couldn't finish the last couple bites. Besides that, it's overall a good salmon dish. Farfalle pasta is probably one of the best pasta dishes I've had at a restaurant. The roasted garlic, parmesan sauce is what makes this dish and it's got sun-dried tomato, peas, & pancetta to not only give it flavor, but color as well.

Fan J.,"Arlington, VA",2,20,,4.0,4/5/2010,"This review is somewhere b/w a 3.5 and a 4. First of all, the portions at this place are a bit ridiculous. It's nearly impossible for two people to finish their entrees and dessert, so if you eat regularly, perhaps consider sharing a salad or appetizer and then an entree before the inevitable cheesecake. I don't remember exactly what we had the first, but I think it was the Steak Diane for my gf and some combo with chicken and salmon for me. Both were decent (3~4-star) -- nothing bad about it but not unforgettable (cuz I obviously forgot). The dessert was probably the chocolate mousse cheesecake, and it was sweeter than expected, but with a 'balanced' richness as it should (3~4-star). The 2nd time, we both had pastas. She got the shrimp with angel hair -- shrimp was good (large, well-seasoned) but pasta was a bit bland after the shrimp were devoured (3~4-star). I got Evelyn's Favorite, which was a blend of at least half a dozen veggies -- eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, and the pine-nuts mixed well though some people might not like it (4-star). Again, the portions were huge, I tried to help my gf with the angel hair, but I had to save room for... the lemoncello cream torte. By then, we were basically stuffed and could only finish half of the cake, which was good, not too sweet or sour, and I would've liked to have eaten more of it (4-star). The food is about a 3~4-star average. I've had a couple of their burgers here as well, but at a different location. The decor at this particular location is quite nice. There is a long set of stairs that wind up to the restaurant where warm jazz welcomes you, and the 2-seat tables are well-designed. I would recommend coming after 8pm on a weekend to avoid the crowd. Quite romantic overall, so that pulls it closer to a 4-star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460

When we first arrived we checked in with the hostess on staff for Friday night. She had indicated it would be a 30min wait to be seated which we did not argue cause the restaurant seemed on the busy side. After 40 mins we were paged to come stand by the hostess desk (standard procedure). But after waiting an additional 15mins and watching people that were paged after us be sat we asked the same hostess how much longer. A second hostess by the name of Lisa working the seating computer stated she had put us on hold because we never turned in our pager... Come to find out surprising enough we did turn in our page and the other hostess even recalled us giving her the pager 15mins prior. When we were finally seated our table wasn't cleaned and no silverware or napkins were present. Since this exact series of events had taken place on our last visit as well, involving the same staff members, we will not be returning here again and suggest the readers of this don't either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Rene S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,1,5.0,10/17/2010,This is one of my favorite places to eat.No matter what I order from here it has been great.The portions are big so you usually have something to take home and the flavor is great.I have tried the tuna tataki salad and the wasabi crusted tuna both excellent when I have a graving for seafood.Also I like the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken costaleta.The Godiva brownie sundae is the kids and I choice. You can pretty much throw a dart at their menu and no matter what you get is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Elyse P.,"Portland, OR",171,29,1,3.0,6/11/2011,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory yesterday for a work-related outing.  It was a gloomy day, but the restaurant overlooks the ocean- if it had been sunny, I'm sure the patio would have been a fantastic place to sit for the meal.  We didn't get any appetizers, (complimentary bread was served with butter) and for my meal I ordered the green chile burger.  It was highly recommended by our server, who was attentive and always within a few feet of our table, it seemed.  The burger was very unique- it had green chiles, tortilla strips, salsa, and some type of cheese.  It was served with a side of green peppers and I opted for the fries (hey, it was Friday).  The fries were crispy and excellent, and the burger was very tasty.  It was pretty big and I could only eat half of it- later on in the day, my body felt super sluggish, like I had ingested way too much salt. Overall, a fantastic experience except for the end of our meal when our server pressed us a bit too much to order coffee and dessert.  Saying no once should be enough, methinks. Next time I am going to try the cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Mark G.,"Turlock, CA",3,14,5,4.0,4/19/2009,"A lean clean food serving machine. You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. Great food, great service, fast. The restaurant was busy when I arrived and I was seated in 2 minutes. Fresh bread was brought as soon as I sat down. Any restaurant that provides fresh bread when seated automatically gets a couple stars. Refill time on drinks was good, not great, but good. Appetizers took a few minutes but were worth the wait (the sweet corn tamale cakes are delicious). The entrée followed and was prompt and hot on the table. I recommend this restaurant for those who like to enjoy a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Jennifer M.,"Westminster, CA",36,172,33,4.0,4/1/2007,"The food is always very good with large portions, and their Arnold Palmer is tied for first with Roscoe's in my opinion!  Of course there is a huge array of choices when picking out your cheese cake! Minus 1 star for the snotty clientele...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Peter C.,"Southeast Portland, Portland, OR",46,86,,5.0,10/25/2007,"I just don't think you can go wrong with Cheesecake factory.  I've had quite a bit of their menu, and I've never been disappointed.  Chicken Madeira, they used to have something called the seafood scatter... shrimp poorboy, sheppard's pie... even the Steaks here could give steakhouses a good run for their money. And dessert?  Nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Randy S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",90,139,43,4.0,1/4/2008,"If I was strictly reviewing the strawberry Martinis it would be 10 stars (is that an option?) I men I've never waited for a table in a dozen visits, probably because I only want to sit t the bar...Geezus who waits an hour for a chain restaurant?  Anyway, an appy or two at he bar, but definitely strawberry martinis made from fresh crushed to your order w/ a tad bit of simple sugar and kettle one.  a bit pricey at $10, but worth it in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Mary W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,,2.0,7/18/2011,"I wouldn't write this negative review except that Cheesecake Factory is a repeat offender when it comes to sitting people in TINY tables with only 2 feet on either side between other tables. I've had this happen to me several times over the past few years at the Fashion Island location. Usually when this happens here I simply say that the table is way too small and ask to be moved, and they kindly find us another table.  But this weekend in particular I just really didn't want to have to wait for another table so I braved up and faced the tiny table. It was horrible. You can't have a conversation with the person you're with because you can't help but hear every word the other parties are saying on either side of you. The servers can barely fit in the space between the tables. And there's barely enough room to fit two entrees on your tiny table. It actually deterred us from ordering an appetizer - where the heck would we put it? Ugh. I almost gave this review only 1 star... but let's face it, Cheesecake Factory has great food which is why I have gone back over the years. But I won't be dining in anymore at the Fashion Island location - ""to go"" only here on out for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
Christie X.,"San Francisco, CA",95,317,4,3.0,6/22/2007,"OK, I try not to review chain restaurants, because really...what is there to say about  them?  They're everywhere, they're popular for a reason and we all probably know why.  But this restaurant deserves a little story. Rewind to summer 1996.  I recently discovered that I was accepted to UCLA and  I was beyond ecstatic.  I met a new friend that promised  to show me around during my orientation.  Filled with glee, anticipation and excitement, I made my way down south.  When we decided to meet up, because I had never really been anywhere in So. Cal by myself, I was game for anything.  When we drove to Fashion Island and walked through the doors of Cheesecake Factory, I was so ""amazed.""   The ""newness"" of it all overwhelmed me - the decor, lighting, menu, food, portion size, hell - the SIZE of the restaurant impressed me.  I had NEVER seen anything quite like it back home.  I knew I had to tell everyone about it, especailly after my meal.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken (not sure it's the correct name, but I think that's it?) and was astounded by the size and taste!  Don't quote me on this, but I swear it was HALF A CHICKEN and the best tasting mashed potatoes I had ever tasted.   I couldn't believe my eyes and every other sensation I was experiencing.  Is everything in LA like this?  I was such a sweet, innocent, naive, little girl.   Since that summer, I have been to numerous Cheesecakes.  Many of the So. Cal establishments that I fell in love with during college eventually popped up elsewhere & CF was no exception.  About five years ago, they started sprouting up North, and yes, I was happy to indulge in my cravings and to create new experiences with friends & family, but the ""special"" feeling of going to one was gone.   That is, until I walk through the doors of this Newport Beach location, then suddenly, everything comes back.   Through the years, I've tried many different dishes and generally, am still satisfied by their consistency (other than the fact that some of their portions, believe it or not, have been reduced.)  A few years ago, I even ordered the chicken ""just because"" and it's no longer half a chicken, but the potatoes are still the shiz-nit.  :)   You honestly can't complain about CF.  Dollar for dollar, I always leave satisfied and stuffed.  And because there are so many gosh darn choices, if you go with a big party, there's always something new to try.  Of course, b/c of its popularity, expect an insane line if you go during normal lunch/dinner hours - especially this location.  If you get a table on the north end of the restaurant with the sky high windows, take in the spectacular view.  No matter how many different Cheesecake Factories I've tried, this one in Newport Beach holds a special place in my heart.  I almost always end up eating here if I'm at Fashion Island.  (In case you're wondering, the ""friend"" and I no longer talk - we've drifted through the years, but I will always remember him for introducing me to CF - thx again, B.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newport-beach?start=460
