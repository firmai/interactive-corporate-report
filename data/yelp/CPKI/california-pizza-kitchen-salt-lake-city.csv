Quinn N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",229,115,144,4.0,12/25/2017,"I had a banhmi bowl to-go so my experience is solely based on the quality of the food. I ordered a banh mi bowl with the expectation that it would have the banhmi taste in a bowl - like a salad without the baguette. The food came out okay, not close at all to the banhmi's taste, but it's not bad.  Here's what listed as ingredients: Quinoa, baby kale, fresh cilantro & mint topped with warm grilled chicken, watermelon radish, fresh avocado, cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts, scallions and sesame seeds. Served with housemade chili-lime vinaigrette and serrano peppers.   Generally I'd recommend them to change the name to be less misleading - it's good on its own without having to borrow a name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city
Ashley N.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,8,3,3.0,12/19/2017,"Ordered delivery to my hotel through Yelp. Order process was easy and they called to verify the approximate delivery time. Nothing at all was wrong with delivery process.  Wedge salad left a lot to be desired. Lettuce quality could have been much better, especially on a wedge where it's not easily disguised. Asked for no egg on salad and they must have skipped past that comment.  Margherita pizza was average. Not super hot but it wasn't cold either.  Silverware is an extra .29",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city
D C.,"Austin, TX",3,9,,1.0,12/23/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences I can remember having.  Was with my 5 yr old son enjoying the Gateway mall and Xmas time festivities, and wanted to grab a quick dinner.  The hostess was very nice and got us seated right away on a busy Saturday night.  From there, it was downhill, waited about 15 minutes, no one came by....no water, no acknowledgement, finally flagged a waiter down to place our order.  Then had another 30 minute wait for the food to come out.  Unfortunately, the food I ordered for my son, who was quite hungry and rambunctious, did not come out.  Waited another 5 minutes for his food, by that time just fed up and got out of there.  Food was just ok.  Waitress seemed oblivious.  I've been to many CPKs over the years, and this seems to be the outlier, but man what a buzzkill to an otherwise fun day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city
Jill A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",114,110,148,3.0,11/9/2017,"My first thought when I walked into the California Pizza Kitchen to meet my friend for lunch was is this place open? The Gateway feels like a dead zone these days and the new Decor on the outside grounds makes me feel like I'm at some institution rather than a warm friendly communal space. Inside the restaurant we were the only customers at 11:30. We ordered the soup and sandwich combination- a small bowl of soup and a half sandwich that left me still hungry. It should have been priced more like six bucks and then I would understand. But it $9 for a chain launch I could have gotten more food at Cafe Rio. The description on the menu made it sound more filling than it was. The soups themselves were delicious- tortilla and tomato bisque- but the grilled veggie sandwich tasted more like some specialty lettuce and a thin slice of tomato than something brimming with Garden goodness. Even the small shred of mozzarella cheese lacked flavor. Our servers were attentive and friendly.  happy to serve. Though lacking in Ambience, the restaurant itself was clean. I just wish that I didn't feel like I needed to have lunch after my lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city

Vida A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",228,784,40,2.0,6/26/2017,"Wow this place is a ghost town, we were one of two tables.  Our server acted like she just survived a busy lunch rush but looking around...I didn't see it. She was efficient tho.  The kids mac and cheese looks and tastes pathetic.  I remember it being one of the best.  The Asian salad lacked half the ingredients it list on the menu.  Mmmmm lettuce.  The chicken club pizza was really tasty.  Place isn't cheap, average $15.  Close to finishing a young couple with a little boy about my sons age started running around the restaurant where i had to get my son under control, as he knows better but I'm shocked the parents didn't say anything as if we were at Mickey D's play land. They had just finished at the fountains it looked like.  Just like the Gateway, this place is dead and has strange patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city

Doug M.,"Salt Lake, UT",88,89,19,3.0,3/22/2017,"CPK has some tasty items and is a place I used to eat at quite a bit before discovering more local joints.

Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102,4.0,9/5/2016,"I've always had an interesting relationship with CPK, mainly because to me it's just not somewhere that jumps and says ""come to me, come to me"" when I'm looking for somewhere to eat, but instead somewhere I've generally only gone to because others want to go and I bow to the peer pressure.  And every time I go, it's actually not that bad and I enjoy it...if this is as far as you need to read, my job is done! I think part of it is the name, and the fact that as soon as I see somewhere ""specialize"" in pizza I assume there's nothing else to offer, and that really isn't the case.  I've debated on prior visits to other locations between 3 or 4 stars because the pizza isn't anything I'd go out of the way for, and while they have many novel flavors, I've never been overly wowed by them, nor would I personally order a whole one for myself.  However, with that, what I can say is there are some good varieties of pizza, and many taste great for a slice or two and then just are lacking after that.  The trick, go with a group and get several varieties and share - it really makes it a much better experience.  My favorites, Original BBQ Chicken, Spicy Chipotle Chicken and Thai Chicken. However, while the pizza may not be quite as extraordinary as the name might be trying to make it out to be, the selection here goes well beyond that with good sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups...I think you get the idea, there is truly something for everyone. On a recent visit to this particular CPK, I got one of their specials which was Roasted Garlic Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables.  This was truly really good, with tender, flavorful chicken along with great tasting caramelized veggies that really hit the spot.  Not much was left and let's just say my plan to have some left overs went straight out the window! Service was good, friendly and our server was totally on top of keeping our waters refilled.  I like the low light ambience of this particular location, it's very warm and inviting and just adds an extra touch that helps it not to seem so chain like. I suspect I may gripe less in the future when a suggestion of CPK comes up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,4.0,2/18/2017,You really can't go wrong at CPK.  Food is good. The place could use a renovation though.  I've been to much nice ones throughout the country.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city
Jason D.,"Sandy, UT",5,1,,1.0,2/15/2017,"So, I am going to a concert tonight, and decided to hit up CPK before I got to the concert. Pizza is delicious so it seemed like an easy call. Note that I'm dining alone. I have currently been sitting at my table for 14 minutes without any service, which is always fun. I've decided to make it a game though. Double fun! Let's see how long it takes for a server to acknowledge me.  *Update* We have surpassed the 20 minute mark! Doors open for the concert in 3 minutes, and while I wasn't planning on being there for the opening band, I at least figured I'd have plenty of time to catch the end of their set. The clock is ticking CPK! The clock is ticking!  *Update 2* There is another solo diner, but in a surprise twist, she promptly received service within a few minutes! I have now been here, parched, stomach growling for 25 minutes. My attempts to call someone over continue to fail. I am sad, but darn it, pizza sounds delicious!  *Update 3* Its been 30 minutes. I'm going upstairs to Bout Time instead. I am still sad.  *Final update* I spoke with the manager, who didn't seem to care, but he offered a very sincere apology with a smile plastered over his face.

Nikki G.,"Clearfield, UT",18,3,,1.0,9/10/2017,"This place stunk in so many ways. When you walk in the door the musty mildew smell hits you pretty hard. We had promised my kid pizza though so we went with it. We were sat immediately by a polite host but were sat in one of those long half booth half chairs tables where you can have a large party or separated tables. The place was half empty so I asked if we could have a table that was a little more private (there was a family inches from our table). The host said no that he had to seat us in the server's section and this long section was his whole section.  That was wierd. I mean easily 4 empty booths and as many empty tables in the place and the server can't find us? The pizza section of the menu was surprisingly small. We ordered a pepperoni kid's meal and a Carne Asada pizza. They were both hot, tastey, and priced right. The server (Matthew on the receipt or Nate on his name tag) stunk of BO so bad it made your eyes water. He didn't look dirty or anything, but oh god did he stink. Each time he came to the table his stench proceeded him and hung in the air after he left. When he reached for the check it was like he was winning a contest on how bad you can smell. The stink of the musty restaurant mixed with the stink of the server was too much to take. I would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city

Loresa B.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",275,180,1024,4.0,1/10/2016,This is one of my favorites.  So many choices on the menu.  I have eaten at several locations and the quality of the food and service is consistently good.  There is lots of seating even for large groups. We had a group of 12 and our server was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Saturday late afternoon and the place was packed as it usually is. My favorite is the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza. They also serve beer and mixed drinks!!  My son used to work here so I have been to this location in Gateway and the Orem location many times.

Greg S.,"Tucson, AZ",5,74,26,1.0,7/10/2016,"We went here for a quick lunch and my 1 star is based on not eating. Had we actually eaten,  it might be higher.  Upon entering the place it overwhelmingly smelled like cleaning supplies,  which was really strange as there was a huge brick pizza oven not more than 15 feet away. Why would it not smell like fresh baked pizza dough...or ANY food for that matter? Suspect!  We were asked to wait about 5 mins to sit although we were the only ones waiting at the time and there were at least 10 tables open. We were finally seated next to a large family with a screaming toddler and a young boy bugling out tunes through a rolled up kids menu.  Appetite now beginning to wane.

Brendan K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",160,68,151,4.0,1/10/2012,"We all have guilty pleasures, and CPK is one of mine! I'm not a huge fan of chain eateries, but when ever I sell my soul I tend to find myself here. Like Sky said I'm a fan of the open kitchen idea. It says I have nothing to hide, and coming from an intensive restaurant background IT REALLY SAYS A LOT! wink wink! I plead the fifth!  I have tried a plethora of items on the menu from pastas, hummus, pork tacos to pizzas. I have to say they have such a wide variety of items that it can be a bit overwhelming, let me ease your angst. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The staff here is typically amazing even on a weekend night, they're knowledgeable, experienced, and know their stuff. If you have the chance give Bob a try he's one of the best servers you'll ever have. Take care of him, and tell him Brendan sent you! :)  In conclusion, when at Gateway and you need a culinary treat step into the CPK, ask for Bob, and enjoy!  P.S. Don't be afraid to try the kids mac 'n cheese! It's amazing and no modicum size either! Seriously, crazy good!

Brandon B.,"Lafayette, CA",2,32,1,5.0,7/27/2015,Just passing through SLC CPK sounded really good and was open late. The jamaican jerk chicken pizza was good but emilys white pizza was a little too ricotta laden. I'm not usually one to go to a restaurant within an hour of closing because the service goes downhill by the minute but this place was an exception. We got there 10 minutes before closing and were seated promptly with no rush. The service was good as emily and I were overly needy because it was our first good meal in a while. We weren't rushed and neither were the 2 parties of 10 and 8 that arrived after us-within 10 minutes of closing.

Julie S.,"Downtown, CA",0,4,1,1.0,2/13/2016,"I have never written a bad review before but I feel this restaurant needs improvement. A group of 5 of us let our server Lexi know at the very beginning we had a short period of time for lunch and it was acknowledged. We ordered quickly, I got a simple Margherita pizza and guacamole and chips for appetizer and dessert. I didn't get the guacamole and chips for 30 minutes in which I asked if they could box it up assuming my pizza would be out soon and I wouldn't have time to eat both at this point. I had already paid and gotten the bill at the very beginning because we were all in a rush and wanted to have that out of the way. I didn't get any of my food until we all stood up hinting at them we were needing to leave back to work. The restaurant was not very busy and there was no reason it should have taken this long. There was no apology and the pizza was cold. In addition no napkins or silverware were offered or given to me when I asked for a bag to put it all in.

That was our plan. California Pizza Kitchen beat our expectations, though, and we were pleasantly surprised at that. It was obvious when we walked in that the restaurant was full. People were loitering inside and out of the entrance, waiting for their table, and there was a line just to get on the list. When we got our turn, we were told it was at least a 25 minute wait, which, actually, probably isn't so much. But our indecisiveness showed on our faces, and the seater suggested that perhaps we would be interested in the counter, instead? We could seat there on a first come, first serve basis, and put our order in right away. We took her up on it, and in the next two minutes we went from a twenty-five minute wait to ordering and sipping on drinks. We also had the added fun of watching the kitchen (as well as the Yanks get beat by the Rangers on the overhead television). The waitress behind the counter was quick and friendly.  She took our orders right away, and kept our drinks topped off for the whole meal. The only reason I would rate this a four out of five instead of a five is because the pizza I ordered was only average.  I've had the Siciliano, which I love for its meat and spiciness, but tonight we tried the carne asada, which was not as good. In fact, it was slightly bland. The meat on it was ok, but the sauce was average and the green peppers lacked any flavor at all. With our pizza, we ordered an asian salad, which we shared, and it was fantastic.  Just enough chicken, just enough sauce, just enough crisps, and just enough fresh lettuce.  It was a great salad. If you go, then, and you're in a hurry, try the counter for something different, and something quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=60

Darton N.,"Houston, TX",18,33,45,2.0,7/9/2016,"Two stars simply for attentive service. The ambience is what you expect of a restaurant downtown. Bustling movement, laughter, and overall family friendly. However, the food was very underwhelming especially when paired with the prices that California Pizza Kitchen offers. I started off (and finished) with the spinach artichoke dip that was hailed as one of their specialty dishes. What I expected was tufts of artichoke hearts and spinach baked in creamy goodness served piping hot with (maybe I set my expectations too high for a specialty) fresh tortilla chips. What I received however was a whole lot of.... lack in flavor. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Sure there was a good amount in there, but it didn't leave me wanting to dip in there more than three or four times. But let's be honest here, right? This is a pizza establishment. So let's level the playing field and judge from there. You can grab a medium pizza at say, a fast food chain, for about six dollars containing eight slices. But why wouldn't we want to spend a hefty fourteen to eighteen dollars for six pieces instead since it is the world renowned CPK? My family ordered the California Club and much to their dismay, out came a pizza no bigger than the trays the serve it on. The majority of the pizza was a salad. The sauce was nowhere to be found, the cheese barely apparent, and the bacon bits were scarce. What went wrong here? I have had peers tell me that they love it here, but it seems to be more hype than anything else. A bougie restaurant where pizzas are disguised as anything BUT pizzas. I don't even want to start on the pasta that my brother got because the price he paid for it and the amount served just seemed ridiculously unproportional. For a chain restaurant, I definitely had better standards. Thank you to our lovely waitress who made sure our cups were always filled to the brim and had the best attitude though.

I called in this morning and placed a reservation for 6:30pm on the dot for my entire family of 21 individuals. We all planned to eat before attending a Jazz game. This is why I placed the reservation. They said they would absolutely have our table ready but if we were a minute late they would give it away. All 21 of us showed up 10 minutes early (6:20pm) and discovered they had lost our reservation. ""Don't worry"", they said. We will get you back in a table in 10 minutes. We didn't get seated until 7:15pm. We literally waited for our seats, after placing a reservation, for 45 minutes. I understand they can't quite control the fact that all of their seats were physically occupied. They couldn't kick someone out of their spot. They had to wait until parties left to accommodate us. I get this. I get the reasons we had to wait. We tried to look at the menu and order our food while we were waiting. They initially said no to this, but eventually let us. The problem is that they never said sorry for losing my reservation and they never tried to make up for it. Like I said, I understand they couldn't magically create a table that seats 21 people after having lost the reservation. But they can make up for that by offering us all free drinks. Free desserts. An apology. Sure the food was ok. Our waitress was nice and great. But dang if I come to your restaurant and make a reservation for 21 people, it's for a reason. We have tickets to an event and can't sit and wait for 45 minutes for a table. We ended up missing the first quarter of the game because of the experience. Before writing this review, my wife tried to talk me out of it, because really, we feel bad for business that have seen failure at the Gateway. I really wish it could go back to how it was 10-15 years ago. I always try to visit the Gateway to help it survive.

But literally the salad was some iceberg lettuce, 10 black beans, WAY too many tomatoes (with a yucky weird old texture), and 5 tortilla strips sprinkled on top. And it was upwards of $15. I left hungry and unimpressed. It was bland and boring and the service was meh as well. We were one of 5 tables and it took us 15 minutes to get our check after we were done. Won't be back. No reason to go anymore. Veggie options suck and it's overpriced for the flavor and what you get. The dining experience was a total let down in general.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20

Veronica H.,"Fruita, CO",0,3,,4.0,3/13/2016,"Had one of the best waiters I've ever had at this restaurant today - Tony was charming, calm, patient, responsive, etc. to our party of seven (two adults, five kids). The food was yummy, and more than anything, I felt taken care of. Love a restaurant where I feel like the staff actually care about us and our satisfaction. Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20
Sutt J.,"Kittery, ME",0,23,,3.0,12/14/2015,"The pizza was pretty good, especially the crust. However the atmosphere and bathrooms need some TLC. The avacado appetizer was also overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20
Daniel K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",8,35,25,2.0,3/23/2014,"I won't return, simply because it is overpriced mediocre food. We went in a larger group, so I was able to try a bit of everything.  I don't mind pricey food, and wasn't shocked (like others in our party) that the pizza size was about the size of a large dinner plate.  Good thing we asked before we ordered, because sharing a pizza might be fine for some, but not for the hungry. I love the way the pizzas were prepared, but in the end, they were tough, rubbery, and honestly not amazing.  If you like tough pizza, you might like CPK.  My wife got a shrimp pasta of some kind, and it was pretty good.  Given the name of the restaurant, it's bad when the pizzas are the worst thing on the menu. We did not get the thin crust pizzas, yet the pizza was still really thin.  I don't mind thin pizza, I just hate to think of how much you would feel ripped off if you did order the thin crust.  Do yourself a favor, and avoid this place if you want some pizza.  All of the chain places (even the bad ones) have better pizza, and much better value.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza isn't awful, because how could pizza taste bad?  It's just among some of the lamest pizza I've had.  Fresh, lame pizza. Enough about the food.  If you're into cramped seating, this is the place for you.  You may not notice with the lower lighting, but with the sunlight, it won't matter.  Use the bathroom at another establishment too: there is freezing cold water (no hot water?) and drying your hands isn't easy either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20
Gabriela A.,"Orem, UT",13,26,8,3.0,11/1/2015,"The food was delicious. The waiter was a little aloof but nice.  The kitchen lost our ticket so we waited a long time for the food.  The manager offered us a free dessert.  We didn't get the exact order on the Kung pow pasta and they had to remove it from the ticket.  Overall it wasn't impressive but it wasn't bad, in the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20
Lauri M.,"Ponte Vedra, FL",2,15,12,1.0,12/19/2015,Not impressed. Very run down and grubby in appearance. Grease smears on wall behind our heads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20
