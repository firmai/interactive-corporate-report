Miranda D.,"San Diego, CA",8,18,1,4.0,4/29/2014,"I like CPK. They have really good salads. It isn't my favorite place to eat, but it's pretty good. Their white pizza's are also good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Andrea D.,"Chicago, IL",243,44,9,2.0,9/11/2011,"Over rated, the waiter suggested a dish, He said it was the best one on the menu (sorry can't remember what it was) it was awful! When he asked, I told him politely and they insisted they bring me something else, which was really nice.

Kathy R.,"Niles, IL",129,266,88,3.0,1/31/2007,"I've eaten here many times over the years. The food quality is consistently good, but the service seems to be slipping. When I'm in Arlington Heights lately, I've eaten here b/c I know it's a kid-friendly place with a kids menu.  But today was disappointing.  The hostess asked if I needed a high chair,  which I did.  I stood there at my table for about 2 min. before I realized no one was bringing me one.  After trying to lock eyes with any passing busboys/waitstaff, I gave up and got one myself. I had the $7.99 lunch special: salad and mini-pizza (BBQ chicken). It was tasty as always.  But no bread was offered or brought to us. My ice tea glass stood empty for 20 minutes until I had to ask the waitress for a refill (by then my ice had melted).  She brought the check without asking if I wanted anything else (my toddler was hungry still).  And though I appreciate how quickly they clear plates away, a manager-guy scooped up my pizza plate even though I was still feeding my toddler off of it - before I could say anything! This CPK is always crowded around lunchtime, and often at dinner, so that could explain the hit-or-miss service.  But, the people there are unfailingly friendly - I do like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Tegan F.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",1,20,,4.0,6/1/2010,"This place is a great place to relax, take the kids, and enjoy a glass of wine. I love sitting on the patio in the summer time, while the kids enjoy chanting for the train to come by. The menu is full of great options. I absolutely love the Broccoli Sundried Tomato Fusilli. It is a light pasta with full flavor! The service is attentive and friendly. This California Pizza Kitchen is a neighborhood restaurant with many repeated customers.

Liz B.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",68,172,20,4.0,1/7/2011,"I was in my sister's hood last month about to do some Christmas shopping but need to fuel up first. We drove around downtown A.H. to find a spot. Rivera was closed so we opted for C.P.K. I have never been there so I was excited to try it. It was in between lunch and dinner so there wasn't alot going on. Our server was good and the food was excellent. I had the Thai Chicken Pizza and my sis had the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. It went down so fast and easy when we were down to our last slices, we looked at each other and took one for the team.

Kathleen P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",202,203,1,2.0,1/2/2010,"(Long sad sigh)  I was out with my husband on a Sunday afternoon and decided to have a quick lunch at California Pizza Kitchen.  I didn't need to look at the menu.  I knew what I wanted.  The BLT pizza- I've loved it for sixteen years.  Okay- here's where I get choked up...the pizza was tasteless, terrible--a poor imitation of the BLT pizza that I had loved.  My husband had a veggie pizza that was just okay.  Maybe it's a sign of the times.  Maybe restaurants are cutting costs by using cheaper ingredients.  I don't know, but I know I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Ruma R.,"Schaumburg, IL",1,9,,1.0,3/3/2013,"Please note: This review applies to a Sunday night visit. I've been here a few times over the past few years. The food is usually decent and the service reasonably great. This time was a complete letdown. The best indication of how a place treats customers is to eat there on a Sunday night. Five weeks back, we did. Fernando, I think, (and I'm not sure, but I'm still venturing to use the name openly here because I was hopping mad by the end of our visit) was completely inconsiderate to us. He seated us, took our order (a pizza and a Kung Pao spaghetti which I've never tried before), and then disappeared to chat with a colleague. Luckily, we flagged him down and told him we needed an appetizer, which came in record time along with the pizza. However, as we (quickly) wolfed down the pizza, it seemed as though he was more interested in his chitchat than bringing us our spaghetti. It was around 5 minutes before closing (and this wasn't our fault--we had ordered at least 30 minutes in advance), he came up to us (real slick) and asked us if we needed anything else. Confused, we reminded him about the spaghetti. This was the exact exchange: F: Oh, I completely forgot about it. What was it, again? Kung Pao spaghetti? I'll tell them--they make it fast. (Glancing at kitchen--chefs were packing up). Us: (Confused and looking at each other) ??!!???  F: It won't take long. Us: (Exchanging exasperated glances) No, it's okay...(and before we could finish he pipes up) F: Oh, you sure? I can bring you something else--complimentary dessert or something? (Not pausing for us to respond) No? Oh, next time you're here just find me and I'll get you something special, okay?  (At this point, my husband and I were disgusted and completely put off and basically would have yelled and demanded an apology if not for the fact that it was 9 pm on Sunday night and we were exhausted. I'm yet to speak to the manager, and maybe I'll update after that).  Overall, disappointing, considering the food is pretty over-priced too. I think you'd have better luck eating there on weekdays or Saturdays, all of which times have worked great for me in the past.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
MARGARET B.,"West Chicago, IL",1,56,3,1.0,10/6/2013,Truly thought the staff was taken over by aliens. Not a one knew what they were doing and it was obvious from the get go. Our waitress greeted us asking if we would like a drink and then went on to name the specific coke products individually. I am assuming she had to memorize the menu and started with drinks. That is about all she had memorized as she had quite a difficult time taking our order. When our food was served to us by waitress it was to the right of our booth on a ledge that was closer to the kitchen instead of walking around to the front of our booth.  One in our party ordered Thai chicken pizza. Literally this was brought to our table a crust with vegetables (NO Peanut sauce and no or very little chicken visible).  We brought this to our waitress attention who in turned sent the alien manger over. He literally stared at the pizza for minutes before offering to send out peanut sauce. What I find appalling is this is a signature CPK dish and if you glanced at one that was made normally and what was served to us it would take a second to know a step or two was missed while preparing this dish yet the manager clearly did not recognize this fact. So clearly the  management and cook staff were aliens too!  This was eventually taken off our bill but needless to say our party of six had a sub par dining experience at CPK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Stina P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,8,,4.0,1/18/2011,"GREAT customer service.  Had an issue with a server - the manager tended to immediately and apologized to surrounding customers.  The chefs mixed up half of our appetizer - they comped it - replaced it within 5 minutes and the manager delivered it. Sadly, I will pass next time on the Tortilla Spring rolls. Nothing special. The Hawaiian BBQ pizza was de-LISH! And Julianne, our server, was fabulous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Ashley S.,"Bloomington, IL",11,23,42,5.0,12/31/2011,"This is one of the nicer CPKs I've been to.  The service was really good; our server was very attentive.  I came here with friends for lunch on a weekend.  Normally my fav is the BBQ Chicken pizza, but it looked like they added a lot of new items to the menu since the last time I'd been there (like fish tacos, pork tacos, sandwiches, chopped salads) The white corn guacamole as an appetizer was very good!  They do get busy at this location, but I think take out is an option.  All in all, I like coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Alan R.,"Glenview, IL",187,640,131,3.0,12/21/2007,"You know what you get at any moderately priced chain,  good not great. CPK is no different.  I got the BBQ Chicken Pizza, the CPK Staple.  I usually love, but was underwhelmed.  As said previously, it didn't sing to me.  Its usually great, but was just average this time.  There are definitely better places to eat in downtown AH.  The best thing it has going for it, is that it definitely is kid friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=40
Eunice C.,"Chicago, IL",12,11,7,3.0,8/20/2013,"The salads, pasta, and delicious thin crust pizza; what's not to like about California Pizza Kitchen? CPK has always been one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. This restaurant deserves full stars however I will be giving it only 3 for the terrible service I've experienced today.  My waitress (Teresa) only visited my table two times in the entire evening. She served my family stale hard, crusty bread as an appetizer, didn't re-fill our drinks, and never came to our table to check on how we were doing. Instead, I see her chatting with the customers at the bar and neglecting my table. I had to ask another waitress to serve my table and get the check.

Ruth F.,"Oak Brook, IL",5,11,17,1.0,10/25/2014,The food here is mediocre at best. I've eaten at the one in Oakbrook several times and always had a positive experience. I'm ultimately giving this location 1 star because of the crappy service. It was 4:00 pm on a Saturday when we came in. We were sat without utensils to eat with. Our server didn't bring out my soup before our meal. We had to ask for drink refills and our food took forever. There were 2 other tables in the restaurant. Worst part - we had to eat amongst a sea of dirty dishes. Our table wasn't cleared once throughout our meal. Gross!! And our waitress would just walk by. Every time she came to our table (2xs) she didn't crack a smile and looked totally inconvenienced. Get a new job girl. The service industry is not for you. Needless to say we won't be back.

Edward M.,"Schaumburg, IL",190,279,141,2.0,6/3/2011,"Not a bad place.  Just remember that they don't actually serve pizza, it's more like a bunch of toppings on bread.  But that aside.   I ordered the Jambalaya which came with noodles instead of rice.  It wasn't all that great if you ask me. A bit spicy but other than that, kinda bland.   The other people with us seemed to enjoy their food.  They had korean tacos for 6 dollars. Someone ordered it and it literally was 2 tacos...

Tom O.,"Chicago, IL",34,21,1,4.0,7/4/2012,"One of the best customer service exerpeiences I've had in a long time. We got seated fairly immediately. Right after getting seated, I went to the bathroom, and my friend went to the bathroom. In that time, no server had visited our table to greet us. When a server finally did arrive, she seemed a little frantic, it seemed that a miscommunication had occurred about who would be taking care of us. Not a huge deal to us.  However, that apparently was so much of a blunder that the manager visted our table and comped our whole meal. He even requested that we have dessert as their treat. The server that took care of us was wonderful: we're fans of the recently-retired BLT Pizza and she requested the kitchen make it even though it was off the menu. She also recommended an excellent salad for me.  Food was great! Everything tasted wonderful.  Not many restaurants I've visted would take the fault for such a minute error, let alone comp a whole meal to gain a customer's satisfaction. I was very impressed and appreciative of the manager and server. Outside of a tip, the least I can do is write a favorable review and revisit to bring them more business.

Brooke A.,"Chicago, IL",77,181,18,3.0,10/23/2012,"We sat outside on a gorgeous night.  It's not bad for pizza, but not the best. The best part is the variety they offer.  Basically any type of pizza you could possibly want, they have.  However, they won't be the best you've had. I had a Hawaiian pizza, which was good.  The pineapple was fresh and the cheese ample.  But it was missing that good ham that makes a Hawaiian pizza. They did offer delicious raspberry-lemonade and strawberry-lemonade, which I would get again. That is, if I go.  The price was a little to step to not try and find a better pizza in the area with a bit more character and a little less dough, no pun intended.  (These pizzas barely have any.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights?start=20

It's absolutely divine! It comes out nice and hot and the ratio of sauce to cheese is perfect. The cheese is warm and gooey. I'd definitely recommend the Barbeque Chicken Pizza.

Ray+San S.,"Des Plaines, IL",38,2,,4.0,9/21/2014,"It is not our first time at CPK or even at this location. We wanted to give it 3.5 stars but since half stars aren't available, we gave it a 4 because of the service.  We were seated immediately upon arrival. It was around 6:30 on a Friday night with no wait. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us throughout our meal. When our order arrived, our server told us he had dropped one of the tortilla spring rolls and that another order had already be placed. One order of spring rolls comes split into 3 pieces. Only one of the pieces had dropped, but we were given a new full 3 piece roll. We ordered the Baja Chicken and Thai Chicken Tortilla Rolls. Both were good, especially with the side dips: guac and peanut sauce, respectively. I would get the Baja Chicken again (because I liked the guac) and give the Mediterranean Veggie a try the next time we are at CPK. We also had the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach Flatbread (enjoyed/would get again), and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza (nothing too special about that one though). This was dinner for 2 and we had leftovers enough for a one person lunch. There is ample free street parking and would like to try the outdoor seating sometime.

I live in the city and work in Des Plaines so the Arlington Heights CPK is a convenient spot for me to meet up with my NW suburban friends after work. The staff is exceptionally friendly and I am impressed with how frequently the managers and hostesses make the rounds along with the servers.

Mark F.,"Gurnee, IL",178,328,16,4.0,11/23/2010,"Options, options, options.  If you like pizza, they have options. Is it the best food I've taken down? Nope. No way.  Is it somewhere a little different that offers really good service at pricing even to the other places nearby? Yes. You betcha! So often I go with the routine - the buffalo chicken pizza (because it tastes so good). This time around, the wife and I went for something new - lettuce wraps and the cheeseburger pizza. I was weary of the wraps before they arrived at our table. Once they touched down, my weariness went out the door. They were good. Surprisingly good. We scarfed them with no problem. Then came our riskier choice, the cheeseburger pizza. The only way to describe its taste is like this -- do you like the whopper with cheese from Burger King? If you said yes than this is the pizza for you. Even down to a ""secret sauce"" it tasted like Whopper Pizza. That's not bad or good...just what it was. I wish the meat tasted more high quality than Burger King meat but it was as advertised. Flame-broiled pizza. We avoided dessert (because we pigged out on everything else). Lastly, I wish I could remember our server's name. She was really attentive, even on a slammed Friday night. We'll keep going back because we like pizza and good service.

Fernando makes dining a pleasure from beginning to end. He is friendly,respectful, personable, efficient and always makes great suggestions. Last night he called our attention to a placard suggesting a red wine where some proceeds go to a heart association. Wow he had us! Erika turned 21 just two days before and there was something very special to celebrate! Last year Dr. Bakhos of Loyola University Medical Center replaced her aortic valve due to a congenital problem with aortic valvar stenosis.  The heart healthy drink seemed appropriate. Later, we chose a shared slice of refreshing key lime pie; what a treat!! The first time we had the pleasure of having Fernando as our waiter, he ended the meal by fashioning a rose out of a napkin. Such a kind thank you and so welcome!.The time was emotional yet Erika left smiling at the unexpected sweet ending to some time alone with mom. Now I have four children and a granddaughter ...so of course everyone wants this wonderful dining experience; kudos to the chefs too because we love the food as well!!!

We came in for lunch yesterday and ordered the spicy cauliflower appetizer, a carne asada pizza and two kids' meals. The cauliflower appetizer is truly tasty but it consists of five pieces of roasted cauli. When you're paying close to $10 for this dish, one would expect to enjoy generous sized pieces of cauliflower. That was not the case today with one puny piece the size of a quarter.  The carne asada pizza was good with a yummy salsa verde. After stealing bites from the kids' meals, I'd say stick with Panera or Noodles for mac n' cheese. They also forgot the edamame we had ordered to go with it. To get it, we had to tell two people, and it finally came after 10-15 minutes when the kids were done with their meals. We were disappointed to see we were still charged for it when the bill arrived. Also, the kids' pizzas are way yummier at the Schaumburg location.

The server simply forgot about us, and didn't bother to check back. The restaurant was pretty sparse for a Monday, So I couldn't even blame it on the crowd size because there weren't that many diners! We sent the egg rolls back. The server at least apologized and offered to replace the egg rolls, but I told her that we had no time to wait and had to be back in the office. The manager approached our table and agreed with our assertion that the food was cold and he didn't know what happened, and offered to take the egg rolls from the check.  Received the check, in which the egg rolls were taken out and did not get at least a discount for the horrible service and the cold food.

Location.   The  salad was ok.  The server was attentive to a point.  In fact asking if we wanted boxes for our left overs. At which point we had not finished eating .we may not be back at this location . Melanie wanted me to add that the server should have been more  observant, that as baby boomers  we are a male and female couple.  Not guys as we were greeted .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Brenna M.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",291,70,11,3.0,1/12/2016,"I've eaten at CPK since I was a kid, and their menu has dramatically changed over the years. This is a great place to bring kids, even for their birthday. I've always had great service here whether I'm sitting outside on the patio or inside. It's in a good location downtown Arlington Heights, right next to the train tracks, which I personally like watching the trains go by as they are not noisy.  I recommend ordering their pizza, or if you're in the mood for a lighter dish, a salad. I've found their entrees aren't great. Another thing my family enjoys is the lettuce wraps (we get them with chicken and shrimp). Their pizza crust is delicious, and almost makes you want to get something fancier than a cheese or pepperoni. My favorite is the California, which has avocado on it (delish) and is less of a ""traditional"" tomato base with cheese pizza than you would think. I highly encourage ordering a cool pizza you couldn't get at a local pizza shop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Taliya M.,"Chicago, IL",207,3,3,5.0,2/21/2016,"I absolutely LOVE this CPK! Coming here with my friends and family is always a great experience because no matter what, I always get friendly and fast service! The restaurant is always clean and the dishes are fantastic. (I highly recommend the garlic cream fettuccini or the jambalaya, it's to die for!) oh and if u have room after that definitely get the key lime pie or red velvet!! You can never go wrong with some red velvet and ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Alice S.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,5,,2.0,12/5/2016,"Takeout pizza was just dreadful. Dreadful. Cold hard and uninspired. Slightly better when warmed in the microwave. Had a cheese/sausage and mushroom/pepperoni/sausage regular crust. Picked it up well before the 20 minutes we were given. From now on, it's California Salad Kitchen for us. We only went there for a charity donation, which is nice of them. But yikes! What a disappointment. And I never thought pizza could be disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Cynthia S.,"Arlington Heights, IL",8,34,32,5.0,6/17/2015,"I'm giving them a five. Why? Because nothing was done wrong. I started out with the avacadoe egg roles and they were honestly amazing. At first glance I thought they would be gross and thought, ""Who  would even eat that?"" CPK really showed me not to judge. I had the pizza (the specific kind starts with an S), and that was great as well. Even our server was extremely nice (cheers to you, Ann Marie)! Overall, once again, it was a great first experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Daisy B.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,17,,2.0,11/8/2016,"Normally love this place. Love the cosmos and the chicken milenese. Last time we went the cosmo was horrible. I had this young waitress trying to tell me maybe because it has lime in it. I told her i know my cosmos and normally when we come here they are great.  I did rememeber what the bartender looked like, a taller girl. I will only order a drink from this place if she is working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Michael G.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,157,,1.0,2/23/2016,"Don't go here thinking traditional Italian pizza. I did and I found out that the pizza here is for people who are not used to good pizza here in Chicago. I gave never heard of pizza like this in my life time. It wasn't bad , but it is just not for me. Bizzarre. Artsy Fartsy Pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Amy W.,"Arlington Heights, IL",82,300,585,4.0,9/5/2014,"CPK is a go-to place if you eat gluten-free. Over the years, they have worked hard to produce a menu of items that are up to their standards and also tasty. It took them several tries with the pizza, but now they've got it. You get three choices (in the GF world, that's a lot!!). They clearly label their menu. This location I have visited many times. They have a typical indoor dining room for the chain, and some outdoor seating right next to the train tracks (can be fun if you have kids). There seems to be a new and very attentive manager working here. Maybe some of the service problems others have noted will get fixed. Although car parking is a short walk away, the bike parking is right out the front door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Martina K.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,10,12,4.0,1/1/2015,"Good service, good food! Depending on what kind of a night or holiday you go on will dictate the time you will have to wait to be seated. On Valentines day there was a wait, but it was bearable! We waited about 20/25 minutes to be seated. However on a Thursday afternoon around 2o'clock, we were seated immediately!  Every time I come here the waitress is super nice, as well as the chef. Our waitress would check on us from time to time and the chef came our once as well! Very polite and good service  The garlic creme fettuccine with shrimp and mushrooms was very good and very filling, even difficult too finish! But again delicious. Portions are generous, especially the salads; you will not have to worry about leaving hungry if you do order one! From the Lite Menu, the cedar plank salmon is SO good! Perfectly cooked and the corn side salad goes along perfectly. Squeeze a little lemon juice on and it is finger licking good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Danielle S.,"Denver, CO",340,489,188,4.0,2/15/2013,"This place is solid. It's a standard CPK, and you get the added bonus of it being right next to the Metra line in case you want to watch the trains. The staff is friendly, bring food quickly, and the food is consistently good. I always get the same pizza (boring girl) and it's always good. Plus, for a carb lover, it's awesome since they give you free bread and butter (though I think you have to ask for it) in addition to the crust you're chowing down on. Yum-o.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Dotty T.,"Lake Geneva, WI",14,11,,5.0,12/11/2015,Perfect place for a kid friendly meal.  The food is good for adults and kids.  We love to sit by the windows so the kids can be entertained by the trains as we eat.  The staff is always attentive and friendly.  Our grandkids love going to CPK and ask for it often!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Megan S.,"Chicago, IL",38,278,47,2.0,10/31/2013,I've had take out a couple times and I'm not impressed with their GF menu.  I had a cobb salad recently and it had a floral taste to it.  I threw most of it away.  I'll be going to Panera for GF salads from now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Katrina D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",50,154,104,3.0,12/9/2013,"My family came here for dinner the day before Thanksgiving to prepare ourselves for eating turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes for the next week.  All our food came out correctly and in a relatively-timely manner.  To me, it just didn't taste as good as it normally does.  The crust was off.  Obviously, I still ate half and had the second half for Thanksgiving breakfast.  It was great reheated! Our waitress was great.  My dad made some awkward comment (not to or about said waitress) and she just went right along with it and kept the conversation flowing while I turned red and buried my face into my hands. I love CPK, but from my experience the Deer Park location is slightly better.  I also think the Deer Park location is a little cheaper, but don't quote me on it. Favorite items: sugar free peach lemonade, Mediterranean foccacia, SEDONA TORTILLA SOUP, spinach and artichoke dip, five cheese and tomato pizza, and BBQ chicken pizza.  Get the honey-wheat crust.  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Victoria H.,"Chicago, IL",661,148,5430,2.0,7/2/2013,"California Pizza Kitchen is a good option for casual weeknight dining.  They have a patio area for warmer days and nights.  If you plan on sitting inside, you should bring a sweater because the air is on full blast making it chilly! *Asparagus + Arugula Salad is one of my go-to small plate starters.  Chopped up asparagus mixed together with arugula, toasted almonds, and sun-dried tomatoes.  The salad is tossed with a lemon vinaigrette and then topped off with shaved Parmesan.  A perfect light start. *Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza is one of my faves.  It now comes on the thin crust, but I usually ask for it to come on the original honey wheat crust.  Slices of Bosc pears cover the crust with sweet caramelized onions and hazelnuts.  They top the pizza off with field greens that have been tossed in a tasty Gorgonzola ranch dressing.  It's almost like a salad on your pizza.  Give it a try! When coming to the downtown Arlington Heights location, you have to go in knowing that this place is pretty much run by female servers under the age of 22.  The service is always mediocre.  The food is usually consistent...the service not so much. They have recently switched up their crusts so pay attention when ordering.  Many pizzas now come on a thin crust and others with a new hand tossed style.  The past 3 times when ordering take out we've specifically asked for and described one crust just to receive another.  Mama Mia!  What's a girl to do?! Last week, we had a negative experience.  I had ordered a salad for my dinner.  While collecting my roasted vegetables and lettuce onto my fork, I noticed a long strand of BLACK hair intertwined within my fork and veggies.  Our servers hair was a light brown and was pulled back in a braid so I didn't think it was hers by any means, but it definitely belonged to someone else who had their hair dancing over my salad.  I tried looking to the kitchen to see if I noticed anyone with long hair.  The only one I could really see was another server with black hair prancing around the kitchen to help out.   She had her hair half up, with tightly hair-sprayed ringlets hanging on each side of her face.   I brought the hair to my servers attention at the end of our meal (because that's when she checked back with us).  She agreed it was gross and said she would bring it to the managers attention.  Minutes later she returned with to go boxes for us and our check.  No mention of the hair again.  Now, I'm never looking for a hand out, but you'd think the manager would come by to apologize or they would offer to re-make my salad, rather than assuming I want to take it home and munch on some more hair of a stranger.  Well, at least it wasn't something worse like a booger or a finger nail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
Tom K.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,6,,2.0,11/26/2015,"I'm a regular at CPK and the food is always good, but the service is all over the board. Last night our party of 8 had to wait much too long for everything: the server, the water, the bread, the soup, the entrees, the bill. The place wasn't full, and there were plenty of staff (many of whom weren't doing much) but they just aren't good at handling big parties. We walked in planning on starting with several appetizers for the table, but by the time we finally got some attention, we were basically forced to order our meals. If you are a couple with unlimited time, CPK is a great option. But if you are a big group you can find a better place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington-heights
