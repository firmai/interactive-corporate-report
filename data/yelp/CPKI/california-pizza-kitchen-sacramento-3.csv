Ryan H.,"Roseville, CA",8,37,5,3.0,7/11/2014,"not bad, however,  be careful of getting food for a group here. The price can spiral out of control and make your wallet take a nose dive into the grand canyon. Well maybe not that bad, but the portions vs price are a little off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Jennifer H.,"Lake Forest, IL",2386,404,2166,2.0,7/3/2012,"My initial thought this place was clean. It was also a great place to sit down considering I had some time before my flight -- no rushing. Good thing. The service was definitelt spotty. The waitress forgot my salad. Then our entrees came out at different times. And this place was practically empty! What on earth would the service be like if there were actually customers? One bonus... There is a full bar and if you sit are the bar, there are TVs to zone out to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Bruce B.,"Walnut Grove, CA",43,775,1001,4.0,2/16/2011,Great selection of brews and full bar. Food is airport usual but tasty. In the A terminal close to Southwest.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Christopher C.,"Sacramento, CA",1352,722,1079,4.0,7/12/2013,"This location is in the food court of the Sacramento International Airport (SMF).  This small franchise is clean and has friendly staff.  The food is pretty good.  I had a breakfast sandwich with Applewood Bacon and scrambled eggs and some fancy cheese.  The bread was grilled,(that was a nice touch).  The prices are a little high because you are paying a premium for service and food inside the secure area of the airport.  Employees cost more, as they must undergo and be able to pass background checks, the operati8ng costs are higher, and the rent is very high.  All this leads to higher prices of about 40% more.  This is understandable so I don't really mind paying $10 for a breakfast sandwich should run about $7.  Plastic utensils is a wierd, but again understandble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Allan G.,"Bellevue, WA",141,194,57,2.0,3/26/2011,"I'm not that impressed with this place.  It might just be because I'm not much of a fan of cpk, but with the other selections at the airport I decided on giving cpk a shot. (this is mainly a rant on cpk's breakfast burrito) Since I arrived at the airport around 7 am or so, I ordered the breakfast burrito at cpk.  I wasn't impressed at it by any means, and when I think of it now, it had everything it described it to be on the menu but it isn't anything you expect it to be. The burrito seemed smaller than usual, I mean you can probably buy two or three burritos from taco bell and still save money to buy something else than this burrito.  Granted, this place is in the airport and is probably more expensive than usual, but try to avoid the breakfast burrito.   don't be captivated by the breakfast burrito sign thingy on the to go menu, it's a trap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
J T.,"Madison, WI",4,251,15,2.0,12/9/2012,"it does have a full bar, and menu.  The food was ""OK"".  Prices are high for what you get even in an airport. The staff was friendly, but this isnt a top spot for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Benjamin T.,"Orinda, CA",0,11,1,1.0,8/20/2015,"Even with the inherently low expectations of airport dining, the quality of the service here was stunning in its low quality. CPK SMF=the antidote to tipping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Miguel V.,"Miami, FL",93,436,92,1.0,1/21/2010,"Boooooo!!! This is the wackest place I have ever been. It is a bar/restaurant with a grip of tables and flat screens playing various sporting evens for the waiting travelers in the airport. I walk in and aske the bartender how much the beers are. A middle-aged light-skinned black man, he responds in a rude and annoyed tone, ""I don't know how much they are. You can probably look at the menu. I don't remember the prices. It's all computerized, I just press the buttons. I know it's a $1.50 for a bigger one."" And then proceeds about his business making no effort to help find an answer to this question.  I decide to sit for a beer and order a 22oz. beer. It is 7:36 and he tells me as he hands me the beer, ""we close at 8:00"". Worried that I would not have enough time to enjoy my beverage I ask if I have to walk out or if I will be permitted to finish my beverage. He says, ""No, we stop serving then, but you can finish it."" 8:05 ""Young man, you better drink up, we about to close."" I ignore him and continue drinking at my leisure expecting to finish in about 10-15 minutes as they close up. He turns off the TVs in front of me playing the game I was watching as if to send a message. 8:12 ""Young man, you really got a wrap it up, we're closed."" I continue to ignore him as I notice that at least 6 other parties are still eating and drinking around the dining room. 8:15 ""Alright, you need to finish your drink, we're closed so you got to go."" I reminded him of our earlier convo about finishing my drink to which he scolded me for ""Not drinking fast enough"" and ""playing on my computer instead of drinking"".  First time I have ever had a bartender that could not tell me how much his beers cost and that tried to tell me how to drink my beer. What a ridiculous, grumpy bastard! I understand if people want to get out of work, but there were many other people at the bar. You should not serve someone a 22oz drink 30 minutes before you plant o kick them out, that just doesn't make sense. I noticed that the customer service in the state capitol was horrible in general, so maybe people are just grumpy up here like back East. Someone should alert Arnold about this situation immediately!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Les M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,59,8,1.0,11/9/2014,"California Pizza Kitchen and Sacramento International Airport cannot ever get it right. I order a pizza with extra sauce and I get a pizza with no sauce. I ordered a wedge salad and they cut it and mixed it up like a stir fry. Today I ordered a pizza with extra extra sauce with an emphasis on extra pizza sauce and got no sauce but extra cheese. The waiter even showed me the order that was presented to them, yet they can't read English??? Freaking morons. If you cannot read and speak English, you shouldn't work in an American pizza restaurant. Go find a nice Chinese restaurant to work at. PLEASE and quit screwing up my $12 dollar mini pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Robert H.,"Oakland, CA",59,60,26,3.0,9/8/2010,Well by the previous review(s) I can tell this place could be hit or miss on the service but I had to spend several hours in the airport (twice) and this place did the trick both times.I had no real impression of the wait staff really waiter/ bar tender other than helpful to let me plugin my laptop there. Another bartender told me very interesting tales of the history of the Sac airport so bonus for a information session along with the suds.   I mean it is an airport bar located in a major restaurant chain... The Beer is cold and overpriced but accessible. I am not picky I guess :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
Sam D.,"Beaverton, OR",0,3,,5.0,7/21/2010,"I only ordered drinks at the bar, so I can't comment on the food.   I sat at the bar and the bartender, I think her name was Steva, couldn't have been more pleasant.  I was able to try a couple of bourbons on different price tiers that I had not tried before.  And when I was ready to leave, I was quickly able to pay for my tab.  Being able to quickly pay your tab may not sound like a big deal, unless you've gone to Home Turf (also located in the Sacramento Airport).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3
