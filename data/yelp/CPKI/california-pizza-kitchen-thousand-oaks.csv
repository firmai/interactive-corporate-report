Damaris H.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,46,2,2.0,11/14/2017,2 stars for the service and the kids food.  They messed up my fish tacos :(.  The fish was so over cooked that it didn't feel like I was eating fish.  It was missing flavor.  Too bad because our waiter gave us good service.  Don't think I will come back based on this experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=20
Barbara L.,"Calabasas, CA",1,11,,3.0,11/30/2017,"A group of 5 ate dinner before the Distinguished Speakers series on Nov. 28,2017.  Two of the orders were totally wrong.  We had to wait for one salad to be made 3 times & not only was it still wrong, it came after the rest of us finished our dinners.  Two of the group have very specific food issues so no one was being picky to be difficult.  When we called the manager over, everything changed.  Amir could not have been nicer.  He followed up, apologized & took the two wrong orders off the check.  Most important was that he cared.  We would definitely be back.  I did not know how to rank the meal as the rest of the meal was good although the service was not consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=20
Anthony S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/16/2017,This CPK is by far the worst place i have ever picked up from being a Doordash driver. Every time i go in to pick up it is a long wait and never get helped or acknowledged and end up sitting there for about 10 minutes and another 10 minutes after while they get the food together. I would recommended ordering from somewhere else if your in a hurry or dont want to wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=20

Bruce E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",457,290,908,3.0,3/26/2016,"CPK has long been a stand bye for me over the years. Beginning when I lived in Brentwood and was a regular at the San Vicente location and now being in Westlake Village it was the promenade which is now Lemonade and the Lakes location on TO blvd... 3.5 stars. I am still a big fan of the original BBQ Chicken chopped salad, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, BBQ Chicken pizza and the Thai Chicken pizza unfortunately for my kids and I that's about it. Those (4) dishes are clearly a solid 4 - 4.5 stars and have been the market standard and replicated on virtually what seems like most every competing restaurant menu over the years.  The downside is the franchise has become stale and the menu and overall vibe has changed along with the prices which are a joke basically $15 - $17 per which as we all know the portions are small to say the least. I really like the location in the Lakes especially when my kids were younger and now it's more of a craving issue as i'm longing for the The original BBQ Chicken chopped salad or Chicken Tequila Fettuccine otherwise there are a wealth of better overall options to choose from. This location is clean and inviting, parking is easy and the adjacent outdoor sandbox, water features and swings are great if you have small kids... With that said enjoy one of the original game changers and know the landscape of what you are partaking!  CPK is more casual definitely not fine dining or romantic by any stretch of the imagination unless of course it's date night for a couple of computer programmers living on the edge with a sarsaparilla...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=20

Andy B.,"Orange, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/23/2017,"Food good as always. Service an absolute nightmare. I understand that servers forget things when asked, but over and over again? My favorite part was when we politely asked our moron of a server for certain little things, it was a huge burden.

Tom G.,"Westlake Village, CA",105,331,1494,4.0,2/12/2016,"Gee - I don't get it?  I see the average reviewer score is 3 stars when every time I've visited here I'd score AT LEAST 4 stars.  I confess my preference is to bestow 5 stars for the best of the best on multiple levels - so 4 stars from me is pretty good / from my point of view. So how was my visit?  I dropped in at 9 PM on a thursday for a mid evening snack with my daughters.  Service was prompt and expert / made easy I admit because there were but 3 or 4 tables occupied - the place was closing in an hour and it's sleepy mid week - eh? Service is on the spot prompt, cheerful and professional.  Servings were exactly as expected - with flavors right on.  We went in for pizzas... nothing special.  Our table and booth was spotless and clean - the worker I interrupted OUTSIDE - who was helping with drive up service handled my interruption cheerfully - my request for extra bread to go with our left overs to take home was handled without complaint - and the bathrooms were clean and well kept? So why not a 5 star visit?  I can't say except that nothing was really above and beyond?  CPK has usually been on the spot competent - plus on RARE occasion something in our to go - we cater a bit from them for business / various locations ... so yeah ... when catering sometimes things have been mildly amiss or not ready on time .  However on this evening all went well.  Just not spectacular... as we have encountered with other businesses.... sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=20
Mariko C.,"Ventura, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I love CPK, but this places service was non existent. Literally. The host was the only person who acknowledged me immediately and was kind. However, I sat outside for over 20 minutes without a drink order or even acknowledged. I thought maybe there was a single server who was busy, but I saw four different servers out on a patio with about a dozen tables only which 6 were filled. In addition, three of those servers looked at me, didn't even tell me when my server would be with me, and walked right past me. One server even checked on the table to my left, then skipped me, and took the check from the table to my right. She didn't even say she would be with me or asked if I had been helped.  I decided to wait another 10 minutes. And still nothing but random looks. Finally just got up and left when I saw a different group be immediately seated and served.

When the hostess showed us to our table I firmly told her (the same person I told the first time) we wanted a booth. That's really not hard to understand. I sat my family at the nearest booth. The guy had to clean it so we all had to get up while he cleaned and he was so rude to my 3 year old. The server took another 10 minutes to take our order. I asked for a mixed apple and orange juice for my kids, she gave me a look. Really?! The salad came out before the drinks did. No water was served either! Husband's cranberry juice was warm without ice. Asked her to add ice, she came back with a glass full of ice. Drinks finally came then food shortly after. She never came back to check on us.

Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",170,188,366,1.0,3/11/2015,"Came for lunch and had a really awful waitress. She wreaked of cigarettes and was not at all attentive. Don't go sit in Michelle's section. She is not at all happy in her job clearly and I've never had such an unpleasant experience at any California pizza kitchen. I have the pizza dough reward app on my phone. I informed her when she came to take our order and gave her the check in code. She wrote it down. When the bill came, she didn't input my card. I knew I had $5 off from the rewards and I kindly asked her to add it to our bill. She told me she didn't see any reward but she would check. I told her it was on my phone. She said oh it might be something that you can only use on your next visit even though I had clearly walked into the restaurant with this reward so it would make zero sense that I would have to ""return"" to utilize it. I asked her to please check again. She never came back with info about the reward and asked us if the bill was all set as if I never had that conversation with her. I reminded her that she mentioned she was going to recheck the system for my $5 off.  She reluctantly checked. She told me the code wasn't working and to give her a phone number instead. I handed her my exact membership # and she rolled her eyes at me. Finally she came back and told us that she had found it.  And even though we had attached the credit card to the bill for her to swipe and gave her no attitude for her laziness, she managed to leave the ""signature"" portion of the check after the card has been swiped at the POS system. She came back and handed us a bill without the credit card signature authorization portion leaving both of us puzzled and frustrated. We were worried she was going to double charge after we informed her she didn't give us a signature receipt so I made sure to check the time stamps on the receipts to ensure it wasn't done twice on purpose. I would never come to her again and I believe she didn't want to honor the discount on purpose.  Also, our leftover pizza was not put in a nice box it was shoved into a little container. I'm really disappointed in how the service was here and probably would think twice about coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=60

That was before......and this is now.  I can no longer make any of those statements.  I ordered a salad on their menu...... one of their newer salads, and I LOVED it.  It was so huge, I couldn't finish it.  I like that, too......then I feel like I'm getting my money's worth.  I ordered their Moroccan salad, which had an amazing assortment of ingredients, and lots of each item.......in addition to lettuce, tomatoes, and nicely marinated diced chicken, there was also roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, chopped egg and cranberries, all tossed in a champagne vinaigrette, which was very light in flavor, but it made its presence known and complimented the salad nicely.  I actually find myself thinking of going back there just so I can get their salad.  I REALLY enjoyed it.  Who knew? Oh, they even served some really good, warm and fresh bread, which always seemed to elude any prior meal there.  Again, I think they've changed ....... and I can honestly say, for the MUCH better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=60

However, the large group of teens that we are going to dinner with tonight really wanted to go to CPK tonght. I called this morning to make a reservation (for 10), and was told they would not make a same day reservation because there is a show at the nearby theater. I asked for the manager, and let them know, that nowhere on their yelp or their website does it say, no same day reservations, and in fact on Yelp under ""reservations"" it says ""yes"". He still said, sorry I can't give you a reservation. This is just the nail in the coffin. While I understand this may be their policy, it goes against what it says on Yelp, and it's just bad business for the manager to not offer a solution or alternative.

The host was a surly young man who definitely couldn't be bothered to at least say hello. After he seated us, he headed back over to the bar to watch whatever sports event was playing on the TV -- not a good impression.  Our server was prompt and somewhat friendly, but didn't offer anything in the way of suggestions. The wine by the glass list and menu choices are really good, so we were comfortable knowing our meal was going to be good.  The appetizer came relatively quickly, but again no engagement of conversation from the server. We noticed but were more engaged in the music that was playing in the background. It was a great playlist from One Eskimo, Rolling Stones, and Avett Brothers.  The entree choices were satisfying and prepared to our expectations. Generally, the evening was pleasant. When the server brought us the bill, we asked if they had XM Radio playing or if they had a prerecorded music list piped in. This was a young man in his 20's and he had no idea and looked as though he could care less.

Jody C.,"Oak Park, CA",52,2,,2.0,6/5/2011,"This is regarding the service at CPK in Thousand Oaks, CA at The Lakes. My family (4 of us) and I have been frequenting this CPK since it opened. Over the past year, year and a half, the quality at this particular location has declined substantially. We also eat at the following CPK restaurants in Canoga Park, Tarzana, and Encino, as well as the CPK ASAP in Westlake Village.  Just last night (06/04/2011), it started off with the hostess crossing our name off the list when we had not been seated (this added an additional 20 to 30 minutes until we were seated). Finally, after being seated, we placed our order. When we asked for bread, and I am not exaggerating... we were given our four bread/appetizer plates, which came to our table filthy! We asked for new ones, which also came to the table dirty. The third group of 4 plates also came to the table dirty... which at this point, my 14 1/2 year old daughter said ""this is disgusting, I am afraid to eat here""! Finally we did receive clean plates. Appetizers were fine. Next came our dinner... my daughter had a full size BBQ chopped salad... upon delivery (not by our waiter, but a different woman), she asked for extra ranch & bbq... the woman never brought it to the table. Once we asked our waiter Ryan, he made 3 trips to the kitchen and back to other tables with water, bread, & drinks before he brought the extra dressing. At the same time the salad was delivered, I received my pizza, which was fine, my son got his pizza, but they made it on the thin crust, when he asked for regular, so that had to be remade. My husband's pizza never arrived. We had to ""flag"" down our waiter to ask about it. He went to the kitchen and came back and said ""the kitchen burned it, and they are remaking it, and both pizzas will be out at the same time"". Well, my son's pizza came, which he barely ate, said it was weird tasting. The pizzas DID NOT come out at the same time, but my husband's came about 15 minutes later, as the rest of the family was done eating. My husband's came out on the regular crust when he wanted it on thin crust. At this time, my husband did not even want his pizza. The manager (from the Ventura location), finally came over and apologized. In the end, they only charged us for 2 salads. Big deal... my husband still never ate dinner! We had to pick him up something on our way home at another restaurant!  YES, this was all last night! We have had quite a few similar scenarios at this same location. A few years ago there was a female manager who was terrific! Then this past year, there was a ""short"" hispanic man who usually had horrible breath and body odor, but otherwise, he was a pretty good manager. We found this offensive as he was in a managerial position. It seems that there has not been a consistent manager at this location and that the service levels are no where near the quality that they are in the other locations listed above.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=140

I haven't really had anything bad there, but I don't LOVE anything there either. I usually feel like I spent too much money. As a parent, I have another complaint. Like the other reviewer, it took quite awhile before our server ever came to our table. With a nearly-two-year-old toddler, that is completely unacceptable.

We had a lovely morning skating with another family today. We went to CPK afterward and asked to sit with our friends at the restaurant. By doing so, the manager would not honor our free kids meals. They considered us ""one party"" and would only allow two free kids meals. We then said we'd just sit separately then, but she still wouldn't allow it. That is totally unacceptable! Each of our families purchased these deals separately as individual groups. The fact we want to sit together should have been inconsequential. The manager's unwillingness to work with us on this caused her to lose our business today. Instead of giving each family the two free meals promised with our Conejo Deal (totaling maybe $18), they lost the business of two groups totaling probably $100. Be warned, people! Don't make this an excursion you do with friends, as CPK won't honor your Conejo Deal. HUGE mistake on their part!

Christina G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",378,2,,1.0,11/20/2012,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. WORST restaurant experience EVER. My friends and I went ice-skating, and there were signs everywhere saying ""free kids meal after ice skating!"" Of course, we were ecstatic. We had some time before the rink opened, so we walked over and sat at the bar. We talked to a waitress by the name of Giovanna, and she told us that we had to spend $10 and we got 2 free kids meals. We didn't have time to order, but we came back after we skated. We came back, and sat in the same spot and saw the same waitress. We ordered one regular pizza, and then two kid pizzas. After the food was delivered and we had began eating, she comes over and says, ""Sorry guys, bad news. I was wrong and you only get one kids meal. So you have to pay for the other one."" Of course, we were upset. My buddy went, ""Why do WE have to pay for your mistake? We wouldn't have ordered this if you hadn't told us."" With sass, she said, ""Do you wanna speak to my manager?"" And obviously we said yes. The female manager came over and tells us she can't do anything, and then walks away. We all look at each other puzzled. Giovanna comes back and tells us we were ""lucky"" because you have to be 10 or under to get a kids meal. (If that's the case, then why let us order it?) The manager comes back and says once again we are lucky to get one free. I looked down at one of the kiddie pizzas, where I had taken one slice out of it and had one bite. I said, ""Do you want this pizza back and then make it free?"" She agreed. So she comes back and brings us the check where we only got one pizza for free. Now they tell us we can't get the other one for free because we aren't 10. Meanwhile before they told us we were LUCKY to get that deal. The VERY rude waitress says, ""Go ahead and have your mom come and bring you $5. Did you drive your Daddy's beamer here? I didn't go to college to deal with this ****."" The manager came back after we tell Giovanna we aren't paying for the pizza. Once again, I ask why we have to pay for THEIR misconception. She tells us too bad and she isn't changing it. Finally the chef comes out and I explain the whole situation. He agrees to give us both pizzas for free. The manager was standing right there and very kindly I look at her and said thank you for your help. Not even looking at me she smirked and just rolled her eyes. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. NEVER going to a CPK AGAIN. WHY would you make the CUSTOMER PAY for your mistake? Just because we are 17 made them think they could pull one on us. If we had a parent with us, I'm sure we would have been treated with much more respect. We wouldn't have ordered the stupid pizzas if it wasn't for the waitresses misunderstanding. OH, and my friend was SICK after eating their Hawaiian Pizza. Coincidence?  NEVER go here. RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL. They do NOT appreciate their customers. Isn't that what the business is all about?

I didn't expect an amazing experience. What I did expect was for everything to be high in calories. The pizza and pasta are high in calories, but they are comparable to other restaurants, and the salads are lower than I expected. That was a pleasant surprise (though I still got pizza!). I went for a fundraiser for Our Community House of Hope, and so I knew I was going to support a good cause and didn't have extremely high expectations. The server was very nice, but the burner broke or something, which meant that my sister and her boyfriend didn't get their pasta until the rest of us were nearly done with our pizzas. While we didn't really want to get a discount because that would have meant less money to OCHH, they did not even offer something for free or a discount even though we waited a long time, especially for their food. I have no hesitations about going to CPK again, but if I have a choice of CPK or one of the other restaurants, it is likely that I would choose one of the other restaurants.

With a chain so tried and true to formula - I almost never miss at CPK.  I've been to locations all over the US - and even patronize the ones at various airports.  And then came CPK at The Lakes.   I'll try to be brief with the highlights: 1.  Bitter hostess - honey - if you don't like your job...get an education and get something better.  I didn't make you work here. 2.  Completely incompetent wait staff.  Once seated, the five of us were literally ignored for the first fifteen minutes - not even water was brought to the table.  When we flagged down a ""busy"" waitress (picture deer in the headlights here) she was in shock that no one had attended to us and said she'd go right back and find our waiter.  Of course it took another social interaction with the hostess with the mostess to identify our waitress, who then came over to tell us that no one told her she had a table.  ""I'm sorry""...would have sufficed. 3.  We ordered food & drinks together - lord knows we're starving at this point.  Water for 3 of us (I know - we're going big), one diet coke and one unsweetened ice tea.  What arrived (another 5 minutes later were five waters, one diet coke and one VERY sweet unsweetened iced tea.  When questioned about the taste of the tea - the wonder waitress mumbled something about how amazing it is that the tea can be so sweet and yet not be sweetened. 4.  Still waiting for food some thirty minutes after ordering, we finally wrangled some bread and butter for the team.  When food arrived, it arrived one plate at a time.  The pasta was cold, as was the one pizza ordered by my colleague.  I carried both dishes back and kindly begged the manager (who was without her name tag on) to assist.  She assured me she would - and nearly ten minutes after the first thirty minutes had passed, we finally all had our food. After a nice little chat with Ms. ""Manager"" she assured us that she had taken care of our bill.  Not once was there an apology - rather just a routine run down of reasons that service was so slow and so I don't give a damn...

We ordered our drinks and entrees at the same time.  We stated that 2 of us were splitting a salad and and entree as were the other two.  She asked us if we wanted bread for the table and of course we said yes.

When she returned she asked if we wanted ground pepper and I answered yes.  I served up the salads and everyone started to eat their salad.  I waited and waited for the pepper and I decided to start of my salad since I thought she forgot about it.  A few minutes later I saw her walking by with a tray of drinks for another table and then she came back to ours to offer the pepper.  As we were almost finished with our salads, she arrives with the bread she offered.

Things sound good on the menu, but the execution is poor. For example, the shrimp scampi zucchini tonight lacked any flavor and the shrimp was overcooked.   The servers are friendly, but the overall operation seems disorganized.

We were immediately seated and our waitress was very very kind. We ordered drinks, the strawberry lime margarita was delish! We also ordered an appetizer, just chips and guacamole. We got the dish and it was literally 8 unsalted chips and the guacamole wasn't blended, it was tiny bits of chopped avocado in a tiny pretty pile topped with black beans. (Eh at least it was only 4.99, you get what you pay for). We ordered 'The Works' pizza. When we received the pizza we were a little surprised. It was much smaller and the bread was super super thin, the chip was thicker. We took a bite and my boyfriend immediately spit it out. There was barely any cheese! Maybe a few little shavings. TONS of bell pepper and a few chunks of sausage that was dry. We were very disappointed. This used to be our go to, and now we won't be back.

Aaron R.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,22,7,1.0,9/20/2014,"Had not gone to a CPK in many years, but had remembered enjoying the bbq chicken chopped salad and bbq chicken pizza.  My wife always remembered it as being quite awful, but she reluctantly agreed to join me for lunch here today.  Unfortunately, the experience was quite horrible.  We won't be going back.   The most glaring problem is the quality (or more appropriately, the lack thereof) of the food.  We ordered a salad, flat bread, and and ice tea.  The quality of the ingredients in the salad was horrible.  When the spinach / mushroom flat bread arrived, it was cold as ice.  We had them replace it with a hot one accordingly, which tasted alright.  However, the salad was so awful, my wife couldn't even eat more than a few bites of her portion.   The restaurant is managed poorly as they do not keep up with the bussing or cleaning up of trash off of the tables.  Our server was trying hard to please (and would clean up the table when we requested it), but clearly did not have the training or intuition needed to be a quality server.  She brought the pitcher of iced tea over to fill up my empty glass, and poured it full of the tea, minus any ice.  There wasn't any ice in the pitcher, but she clearly didn't recognize that this was a problem on her own.  There were so many other glaring details in the service and quality of the food that were missing.  It's clear that this chain has seen better days.  At $28 for the salad, bread, and an ice tea, this is an incredibly poor value.   We will not be going back to CPK ever again.  I usually don't wish ill-will upon a business (particularly those in my own community), but this one is so bad, that I do hope that they go out of business and ultimately get relaced by a stronger dining establishment.  Oh how I wish we would get a California Chicken Cafe out here in Westlake Village.   There, you can get a similar meal (having much higher quality ingredients) for about $18.   My strong recommendation is to avoid CPK and instead to go to the Stonefire Grill, less than a mile east down Thousand Oaks Blvd..  The differences in the quality of the food, and overall experience between the two is night and day.  One (Stonefire) is managed and run extremely well.  The other (CPK) is stuck in the 80's and clearly trying to maximize its profits with crappy quality food at ridiculous prices.  CPK either needs to entirely revamp its approach to food and service, or needs to go out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=80

Leana M.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,12/27/2015,"CPK is one of those chains that started off great and is now becoming a corporate , money hungry business that only hires people who do not give a crap about their jobs and should not be in customer service. The managers at this location are rude, unhelpful, and are only concerned about upping sales. The last time we ate here, my mother asked for her chicken on her salad to be made fresh, not pre-marinated with garlic, because she is ALLERGIC and the manger was so rude and refused even though with pervious managers they agreed to do it with no extra charge. He only agreed to do it ""one time only"" after my father came into the restaurant and he backed down because my dad is a tall, 6 foot tall, intimidating guy. This specific CPK is not the only location that refuses to help with special orders. The fact that a restaurant refuses to make FRESH chicken that does not have bull shit sprinkled on it is disgusting. Pre-marinated, mass produced food is what is making the American people obese. In addition, the service is hit or miss. Once again, that comes down to management.

I recently discovered this specific locations Curb Side Pick up and received my meals that way. The last few times tho, even after confirming my order was correct when making it over the phone, there has been a few issues. When I've picked my order up and taken it home, the order has been wrong. This happened a few times but I never said anything. A few days ago, I made an order over the phone to pick it up at Curbside and the lady that took my order confirmed everything with me twice and then told me the total at the end upon request. When I went to pick it up, the employee that brought out my order gave me a different total that was more than what the previous total that was told to me was. When I told the server he just apologized and took my card. Even though he sensed my frustration he didn't offer to compensate me for the mistake. In my opinion, when your told one thing with an order, especially the price. You don't go back on the original price your told. What if I only brought that exact amount and couldn't pay for the rest of my order? Times are hard financially and I asked the grand total in advance for a reason. After I got home and took out my order, on top of it the order was missing specific things that I confirmed with the person that took my order and reassured me nothing would be forgotten. It for sure didn't seem worth the extra dollars that I really could afford to spare.

Erika V.,"Topanga, CA",565,217,25,2.0,10/16/2011,"Ugh, CPK... Why offer thin crust if you can't get it right?  One thing I tend to like about the 'upscale' chains is that they tend to be good about getting the basics right. Even if everything else falls short, usually the basics of the cuisine tend to be there. CPK fails in this respect, as when my boyfriend and I both ordered thin crust pizzas, they both came back just slightly thinner than your standard pizza. Look, it's simple. Either roll out your dough thinner, get a sheeter than has a thinner setting, stretch out the damn pizza dough by hand or DON'T offer effing thin crust pizza. Worse, kick your ovens up a couple hundred degrees and at least trick me into thinking I'm eating thin crust pizza with a crunch on the bottom. Soggy pizza crust just doesn't do it for me and as a matter of fact, it rather pisses me off.  My toppings were good though. I forgot what I ordered something with a butt load of onions, artichoke hearts and salami and that was good. They didn't skimp on the artichoke hearts so my experience wasn't that terrible. I didn't try my boyfriend's pizza but he seemed to like his enough to not complain.  What does suck about CPK is their beer menu. C'mon, this chain is doing really well even in these hard times. How's about getting more beer on tap than just Budweiser or Coors? The best beer in a bottle available is Heineken. Now that's just embarrassing. Get it together, CPK. You guys are well funded.

Their menu options are nicely varied and the quality and quantity of the food is excellent. So many chain restaurants rely heavily on salt and sugar to appeal to peoples' desire for a tasty meal. I have to say that CPK seasons their food perfectly and uses salt and sugar very judiciously so that I would describe their food as really well-prepared and healthy, substantial but elegant comfort food.  In particular I want to single out Emily, one of the TO store managers. She demonstrates the ideal qualities of a genuine, engaging, warm personality and a strong desire to help out her team to make sure that the customer gets exactly what s/he wants. She is an incredible asset to the restaurant.  When one small issue cropped during a visit, the general manager, Amir, stepped up to make sure we knew he was addressing our concerns, going above and beyond what we could have ever expected to make sure we were taken care of. He let us know in several ways how much our opinions and experiences mattered to him and that every single concern and suggestion was going to be included in his team management meeting. This is our first go-to restaurant in T.O. The food, service, atmosphere are outstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=120
Tina M.,"Westlake Village, CA",54,45,6,1.0,5/16/2015,"The service is awful! I ate here at 1:00 pm on a Monday and the restaurant was only 1/4 full. No refills on drinks from the server unless you find her and ask. Not clearing plates from first course while you eat 2nd course. Actually, she presented the check and all the dishes are still sitting on the table (1st and 2nd course) Not friendly service or common courtesies. The management does a poor job of training their employees. I looked at the calories on the special menu of calories and the food is high in salt and calories. I will not be eating here again.

Not only was it busy but the line of people waiting just to check in was out the door. Only one hostess on duty at prime lunch time on a Saturday....  The manager on duty walked by the front several times and saw all of us waiting because the poor hostess was overly busy trying to seat everyone she could. At no point did the manager ever acknowledge any of us or make any effort to say, ""sorry for the wait"" or make an effort to help the hostess seat or take names. And we watched him doing nothing but stand at a computer and watch the floor the entire time. After we finally got seated, during our lunch, we watched him at the kitchen buttoning and retucking in his shirt! In the kitchen area, in sight of many patrons eating. Completely unprofessional and dissapointing. I haven't been to cpk in a long time. I always remembered being great. This time, it was just ok.

Also, considering I'm a vegan, I asked her if the dish I was ordering was vegan. She said CPK didn't classify if things were vegan or not, which was understandable. But when I asked her if she could ask the chef if there was any dairy or animal products all she said was, ""there isn't any meat."" Also she told me I couldn't make 2 separate orders over the phone which didn't make sense.

Maria O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,13,2,2.0,2/18/2015,"I was sorely disappointed at my last visit to the California Pizza Kitchen here in Thousand Oaks. They offered me the bigger flat pizza versus the regular size. My husband and I went for the thinner crust larger pizza. His pizza because had artichoke hearts on it and such was so uninteresting and bland that I would have sent it back. He did not. Mine which had to jerk chicken on it was better but still it was a very disappointing pizza. They should not offer that flat larger pizza because they add nothing to the cover the larger area. So, it ends up being a larger pizza which is sparsely covered & flavored. There is practically nothing on the pizza itself. A regular-sized pizza probably would have been better. But, still in all the food was not very interesting or very good I would not recommend this restaurant and I will not go back. The high point of the meal was the ECCO Domani white wine recommended by the waiter which I found fabulously wonderful. Too bad.

When the server came to collect my card there was no interaction with her asking how the food was or how we were doing, the only thing she asked is if we were ready for dessert.

Although everything started well, we were sat promptly and the drink order was taken right away.  And then everything started going south.  The bread we requested never came until the appetizers were brought out.  Then the food order came out with two wrong dishes.  Although one was fixed, the second and most important for the toddler had to be made again.  The waitress said it would be taken off the bill and brought out right away.  After waiting another 10 minutes it was brought out but the pasta sauce was still wrong (we just ordered fettucini alfredo) so they had to remake it yet again.  At this point my son was over it since it was going on 20 over minutes and we had all finished our food at this point (which he didn't want to partake in).  After asking for the bill so we could just take everyone home since full meltdown had started, I realized we were still charged for the dish and asked what had happened.  Waitress then said taking food was up to manager discretion and i said ok that is not what had been said earlier.  So she stepped away to find manager I assume but after waiting another 10 minutes we simply had to leave.  Very disappointed especially since this location messages being family friendly.  Not if you want an unhappy family with hungry kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=100

I have been coming to Thousand Oaks for many many years and the food is always amazing as well as the service. Yesterday I dined in for lunch with myself and 3 others. We ordered 2 salads, and 2 pizzas. A couple of drinks and the bill was $82. I noticed that both the pizzas and salads went up in price and the salad portion is noticeably different. Is also noticed that the portion of oil in their dipping oil has also gone down. Something so minor, yet so noticeable. I know all restaurants are doing what they need to do right now, but the full size of the salads really got a lot smaller, especially with using a different bowl now instead of a plate. I just think that if you lower the portion size, then why do you need to raise the price by 1-2 dollars each item.

Then when our lunch arrived the first employee we spoke to stated that lunch was on him....he turns out to be the General Manager (Amir K).

Still overpriced then, but at least back then the food was good.  NEVER Again..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
Karen F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,44,2,2.0,11/26/2017,"I am over this place!! My kids school had a fund raiser here last month and on a night they know they will have a big crowd they were under staffed and had a half hour wait with a half empty restaurant?? We were starving and went next door. Then I went back last night and was outraged and the price of a pasta meal at $18- that is ridiculous for a family restaurant, and the portion was small and I was still hungry!! Pizza is always good, that is the only thing you should eat there. Salads average, they have cut back on portions and not as good as they use to be. CPK should lower prices and work on customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
Elisa H.,"Westlake Village, CA",77,548,1461,3.0,5/16/2016,"Service here has for sure been kicked up a notch! We were greeted and seated right away. Our server came by quickly, took the kids orders and gave us a little more time to decide. He was friendly with a sense of humor. Ordered these and cheese and the kid cheese pizza. For ourselves we ordered a Thai chicken pizza bad a veggie pizza with goat cheese. The kids Mac and cheese was pathetic. Curly pasta with what looked like a powdered cheese sauce. Really had no taste. The kids cheese pizza was good and enjoyed. The Thai pizza was good, not great while the veggie pizza was very pretty, that is, if a pizza can be pretty. A manager came by our table twice to check on us asking if we needed anything else. Can't ask for more than that by way of service improvements!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
Dana S.,"Moorpark, CA",28,18,6,4.0,9/25/2017,Love CPK. Always. But salad was a little wilted that night. But we came for my nephews fund raiser so the dinner was great overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
Ajit S.,"Westlake Village, CA",11,2,,5.0,6/23/2017,Excellent customer service. Awesome team work noted. Every member of this CPK was attentive to their customer. I did not see any server just standing or hanging out. Their Manager visited every table.  Definitely something to learn from this team. Good was good and fresh  good. Thank you to this CPK specially Jake and he mentioned his manager Justin for a pleasant happy friday for our family. Highly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
William C.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",150,23,22,4.0,5/13/2017,"Beautiful location in Thousand Oaks area for this CPK right by the Civic Arts Center. I took my mom here for a quick lunch today. Beautiful day and nice outdoor seating area. They have a full bar but only about 4-5 beers on tap. The bread was really good, but could be a little bigger.  I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza which was pretty good. I also got an Old Fashioned which was made surprisingly well. Can't imagine they make too many of those at CPK.  Definitely a thumbs up and I'd recommend. CPK always makes good pizzas but they also have a lot of other options on their menu. Tacos, sandwiches, soups, and the desserts looked very good! The food came out pretty quick too, but it seemed like a slow day. Friendly waitress and hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
Sallynaz E.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/10/2017,"I ordered DoorDash delivery service - 2 pizzas, 1 cup of soup (pre-made), 2 butter cakes (pre-made). 45 minutes after placing my order, my DoorDash delivery man called and advised that the restaurant had not started working on my order, did I mind waiting 20 minutes? I told him no problem. 30 minutes later I received a call from DoorDash corporate advising that California PIZZA Kitchen had run out of PIZZA dough. Obviously, I cancelled the order. Total dumpster fire of a restaurant. If the manager had called and apologized - and not thrown out some weak excuse an hour before closing about no more pizza dough..Totally wouldn't be making my first negative Yelp review. And they made the driver sit there and wait. Not cool. DoorDash handled everything like absolute professionals. CPK? Completely lost my trust. Wouldn't eat at any location if this behavior is condoned by management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks
