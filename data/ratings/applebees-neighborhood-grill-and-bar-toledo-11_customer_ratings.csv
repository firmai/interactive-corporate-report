10,Andrea S.,"Sylvania, OH",23,69,,2.0,2013-03-09,"5 for the wait staff, 1 for the food.   Chicken tortilla soup tasted like they opened a jar of Pace green salsa, thinned it with chicken broth, and threw a few hot peppers in...it was inedible.  Fried green beans good, sliders horrible--tasted like frozen white castle.  The Weight Watchers shrimp Parmasen had no flavor, and no way was that 300 calories.   They must have given me three cups of rice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
9,Thomas S.,"Toledo, OH",0,36,,2.0,2014-07-08,"I've got to find somewhere else to eat. I've had great food there but 2 months later corporate must have a meeting and decides to change things up, then it's bad for 2 months. Corporate food, new interior is bland, better to frequent local restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
6,I S.,"Evanston, IL",0,30,,3.0,2014-08-03,"Maybe I'm too sold on the many delish local restaurants but Applebee's is not quite my style. Their food has never been horrible but there is a significant difference in the quality here-- it's usually on a bit more artificial and greasy tasting side. Though I should say their molten chocolate cake is pretty good. I haven't had a horrible experience here but I've never had blow me away service either, definitely on the more mediocre side of things",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
5,Ed S.,"Sylvania, OH",0,1,,4.0,2015-02-13,"I stop in at Applebee's v2/3 a week/.  I like their menu items. The food is always good and their prices are comparable with most. The service is good,  IF THEY want to take the time to wait on you. I was in there today at 3:30 PM.  I was seated right away and the girl was friendly. I noticed 6 girls  setting together talking. They noticed me and I guess they couldn't decide who's table it belonged to. After a few minutes, I left. They all watched me leave and didn't budge. I saw a lady walking around, who I believe was the manager. By the way, the restaurant was not busy ~~~~~~~~~.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
3,Alexandra H.,"Sylvania, OH",2,15,6.0,1.0,2015-03-06,I would give it 1/2 a star if I could. And I give it 1/2 a star because their Motz sticks (only got 4 of them on a little plate/usually get about 6-8) and pot stickers were pretty good. Then again that all we got for waiting over 45 minutes.  The waitress didn't seem like she cared about doing her job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
7,Richie R.,"Adrian, MI",0,4,,1.0,2015-03-22,"no wait time on this cool Sunday evening, although it took about 3 brewfills & an hour later just to recieve a salad,  dont care where these waiters fell off from, my verde nachos were light & extra crispy, the order was mapped to his benefit, dont waste your time with this place, mcdonalds is better, almost removed my family & paid for the drinks. i dont recommend this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
2,Paul G.,"Sylvania, OH",0,24,,2.0,2015-04-04,"So Applebee's remodeled and promoted their ""new"" menu. My wife & I tried it after not having gone for over 4 years.  Staffing was inadequate to handle a medium crowd.  Tried the rib tips. They looked and tasted like they just came out of the microwave. Wife's salad was not fresh and could've been waiting for someone to order it for a couple of days. Rated it 2 stars because they did a nice job remodeling.  If I visit again 4 years from now, maybe it'll be remodeled again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,

0,Scott S.,"Maumee, OH",0,19,3.0,5.0,2017-04-14,The restaurant is very clean and decorated nice the food was good. The staff is friendly and courteous and willing to make your experience a good one.  The prices were great and our overall experience was enjoyable. We go there about once a month and have not had any issues with the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
1,Katie D.,"Reynolds Corners, Toledo, OH",102,5,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Ordered car side to go. Waiting for almost ten minutes. My fries were cold, got the chicken fajita roll up wrap and it was completely soggy. My side of sour cream was watery and not cold so I didn't eat it so I wouldn't get sick. Waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-toledo-11,,,,,
