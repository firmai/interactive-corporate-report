Teena D.,"Toronto, Canada",4,1127,12695,3.0,5/10/2012,"I conducted 26 one-on-ones today at a client's site ... then I had to scamper to the airport to catch my flight home (it was the last one 'til tomorrow). After I returned my rental car and went through Security at the airport, I had supper T.G.I. Friday's, which is just after Security.  They have renovated the Winnipeg airport in the last year and it's great now to have choices. It was a busy spot so I had to grab a seat at the bar. The menu isn't very large so I ordered chicken fingers and fries.  They came out about five minutes after I ordered them and were surprisingly hot.  And they were good.  I like the honey mustard dipping sauce. My server was Jericho and he was very friendly and efficient. It was great to get a meal into me before I had to board my plane (which was about 20 minutes late in leaving).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-winnipeg-2
Jim S.,"Jackson, MS",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2014,"This could be the WORST TGIF Fridays I've ever been too!  Maybe the WORST restaurant ever!  You would think at an airport the food and service would be quick. Waitress knew nothing about the menu...speaking of the menu, you could put the entire menu on a business card. Bad food, bad service, bad menu...did I leave anything out?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-winnipeg-2
Matt W.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,19,8,3.0,2/8/2012,"I did not eat here, had a scotch & beer, thank goodness this place is here because all you get in this terminal is a duty free shop, small news store & a portable Tim Hortons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-winnipeg-2
John F.,"Arbutus, MD",14,10,9,4.0,9/7/2012,"For the only place to eat or get a beer, this is the place at Winnipeg airport if you're flying back to the states.  Music is dated but not bad.  Seating is limited but seems to work.  Service is fast and the food was good. Try the California Club. I guess it's a Cali Club because they add avocado sauce. Works in this case.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-winnipeg-2
