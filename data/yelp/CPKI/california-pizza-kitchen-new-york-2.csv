Lydia W.,"Douglaston, NY",70,30,5,3.0,6/3/2017,"I walk by this CPK maybe twice a day and have always shuddered at the thought of a chain restaurant having a posted 'C' rating in Murray Hill. One of my friends suggested we go for a quick Friday lunch and I spent too long looking online for a CPK meal option that would be semi-healthy AND wasn't ridiculous for the listed price. The location was relatively empty and the noise level was down to a quiet chatter. We were quickly seated in a booth that had a great view of the pizza oven and the takeout counter. Not too shabby! Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and Julia, our lovely server. Julia came by regularly to take our orders and walk me through the lunch duo menu. Wanting to get in some protein for lunch, I inquired about adding shrimp to my small salad. My bad for wanting to treat myself to some protein, eh? It's really not the location's fault, but I believe it was 6 shrimp for $5 or vice versa. Either way, I couldn't quite justify that price for such a small quantity of shrimp when it's about $6/pound for shrimp at my local grocery store. I ordered a lunch duo of a small Caesar salad and Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley soup. For lunch, it would do and although my dining companion picked up the check this time, I wouldn't find myself paying over $7 for a cup of soup and a side salad (without a real protein).  My croutons had a taste that was reminded me a lot of star anise. I'm not sure if CPK buys their croutons from a supplier or intentionally overseasons them, but the taste was too strong.  My dining companion ordered two appetizers/starters of White Corn Guacamole and a dumpling dish. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal choices. It's probably a personal preference, but dumplings at a chain pizza restaurant? I can see how chains like CPK do well in the suburbs, but it's difficult being a jack of all trades. I'm not sure I would be back to try other items on the menu, because the price doesn't come close to justifying the quality of food. The menu lacks a cohesive theme other than 'mid-level bar food' or 'casual lunch spot.' For the price they're charging, Midtown has no shortage of even other chain restaurants that can also hit those notes for less money. That being said, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20
Natan G.,"Seattle, WA",55,12,2,1.0,1/16/2017,"I live near the California Pizza Kitchen. Recently I observed one of their delivery men riding his bicycle on the sidewalk, which was dangerous to himself as well as to pedestrians, and also illegal in New York City (source:  ). I called the California Pizza Kitchen to find out why they tolerated this behavior, and asked to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for nine minutes. Then somebody picked up the telephone. I identified myself as a neighbor and asked why the delivery man was riding his bicycle on the sidewalk. She said that I'd need to speak with a manager, then put me on hold again. A minute later, she or somebody else disconnected me. This is not a nice way to treat somebody, or even an acceptable way. Also, I once dined at the California Pizza Kitchen and was served a ""pizza"" with barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce. There is NO definition of ""pizza"" that includes barbecue sauce as an acceptable ingredient. I very strongly discourage anyone from patronizing the California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20

When it came out, it looked spectacular and when I tasted it, it was just unbelievable. I've never had a Bianca flatbread like I did today. The food came in on time and hot, just the way I like it. I ordered salmon with angel hair pasta in a picatta sause. Julia, our server was pleasant, professional and a delight. The manager Vanessa, introduced herself when we walked in to the establishment and I was very surprised to experience such a wonderful greeting. I found out at the place was Under New Management about 2 months ago. What a difference from the other many times that we were here before. .

Maria M.,"Mount Sinai, NY",3,66,2,1.0,10/21/2016,"Went for lunch with my coworkers to celebrate the weekend and boy do we regret it. Took us an hour to get the food, mind you we only get an hour lunch. I would not have minded so much if it was busy but the place was empty. Ordered 3 lunch combos - all the soups were cold.  I saw the food sitting at the end of the bar for about 15 minutes before it was brought over to us... I almost wanted to get up and get it myself. One of us was sent the wrong soup. The salad looked like play-food... and tasted like it also. My coworkers veggie sandwich was basically just bread. As soon as we got our food we asked for the check because we had to get back to the office. This took another 20 minutes. The waiter did not seem apologetic when I made him aware of the issues with our food. I asked to speak to a manager who also did not really seem to care and offered us 1 free entree and 1 free small plate... for 3 people's ruined lunches. His excuse was that take out was busy.... okay but the waiter isn't the one doing take out so I don't understand how that makes any of this okay. The waiter was laughing as he saw me make a complaint.... I know it's a chain - I wasn't expecting amazing quality/service - but I will never return to this location. Take it from someone who works in an Italian restaurant and handles corporate catering... do not come here unless you want to waste your money and your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20
Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",454,745,314,3.0,1/10/2016,"I, like most everyone, know California Pizza Kitchen as one of those suburban food court restaurants that's always attached to shopping malls and outlet stores. I've never seen a standalone location until this one.  The food is pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant chain. Decent, but generic tasting. Still, it always works as a lunch spot with co-workers and they offer a wide range of menu items that can please even the pickiest of eaters or those with dietary restrictions (hint: gluten-free pizza). I also rather enjoy their pastas, despite that there's gotta be a crapload of sodium and preservatives in those sauces (or maybe because of?).  Portions are huge and I can never finish anything without having leftovers, be it with pizza, pasta, or salad. A least you get your money's worth. Also, my office gets a company discount, and who can say no to a little extra savings?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20
Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",948,1027,25111,4.0,12/14/2014,"So my new boss brought me here for my ""first day/welcome lunch"" last week and I was excited because even though this place is a chain - it looks like one of the more decent ones. I was really torn between 3 or 4 stars - but they pulled ahead and got that 4th star and this is why... _________________________________________ Ambience: It's a big, open space which lends itself to be good for group outings, but also has a warm and inviting vibe thanks to their simple decor and relaxing, West Coast like color palette.  Service: Our waiter was friendly, efficient and helpful. Everyone we engaged with was really nice, no problems with service here for me. Menu: For a place called, ""California Pizza Kitchen"", I was pretty impressed with the diversity on their menu. People who eat gluten-free, are vegetarian, are watching their weight and are looking to throw down and pig out will all feel welcomed here! Want pizza? Of course it's here! Craving tacos or pasta instead? Sure thing! Sides? Options galore! Everything is reasonably priced and servings are generous - these are a few of my favorite things! :D Food: My boss and one of my coworkers both opted for the California Club Original Hand-tossed pizza. It features Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, arugula, fresh torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo...essentially this was a very nicely sized pizza on top of a salad. They were both happy with the portion but both agrees that the dressing was sparse and the arugula used was a tad on the drier side. I ordered their White Pizza which came with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic. My pizza was insanely decadent, rich and amazingly satisfying...then again with so much cheese and these types of ingredients it's really hard to mess up.  On a whim I also asked our waiter if they would happen to have any hot sauce and to my delight he said, ""sure, would you be okay with Cholula sauce?"" OHHHHHMAGAHHHHH WOULD I!!! Lol. This ladies and gents, is what catapulted California Pizza Kitchen into 4 Yelp-star land! _________________________________________ In short I would totally return here if in the neighborhood (which doesn't have that many good food selections to boot) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty sit down meal in the culinary wasteland that is (especially this part) of midtown/Flatiron.

Are you kidding me!! So we went ahead and oder pasta instead but while wating on our food, i saw about 12 different order of pizzas been made, there was no reason to lie on our face that the oven was broken.

Amelia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",127,55,389,5.0,10/10/2017,"I like shrimp scampi zucchini pasta. It's light, not heavy, nor greasy, not spicy. If you are on diet, definitely go for this. The shrimps might be frozen ones, but they tasted pretty fresh.  Hawaiian hand-tossed pizza is amazing. The ingredients tasted very fresh! It came in 6 pieces and they are huge!  Kung Pao Chicken spaghetti is really spicy! Delicious! They used fresh red pepper for this. If are a regular Kung Pao lover, this is a must try for you.  The California Cobb salad looks gorgeous. It came in a huge container with lots of yummy ingredients. Super delicious.   Garlic cream fettuccine is so good. Really yummy. I really like every dish that I ordered today. I enjoyed them very much. Each order comes with a piece of bread. These bread are given with olive oil dressings for dipping purpose. The dressing contains moderately flavorful herbs. I really like these dressings. Their napkins are of huge size. Check out my photos. Our orders were delivered on time, well packed, was not missing anything.

I had very low expectation about this place but I went since I'm starving after attending filipino parade around the area. My bf told me to try this place & I just follow him. The place is really big, clean with nice interior.  For appetizer we got white corn guacamole + chips- avocado, sweet corn, peppers, cilantro & bell peppers. This is different. The corn & avocado together is yummy! The corn makes it a little sweet. Perfect combo! Half size California field salad- watermelon, strawberries, greens, basil & pistachios. Perfect!

Cheap eats, with a lot of options for any dietary or eating restrictions. (they're vegan friendly, and able to accommodate)  Their portion sizes are great for one person, and also great for sharing. Our waitress was extremely sweet, helpful and high-energy. We also had a manager come over to the the table to check in on our service after we put in our order.  The clientele was primarily families - so please note this would be a great place to gather with a large group of people without spending $50/person. I ordered the whole wheat veggie pizza, which had an amazing topping/dough/sauce ratio, and the shishito peppers.I would recommend getting their olive oil on the size because it was amazing and gave the pie an extra boost of flavor.  I personally ate my entire pie (carbs are the way to the soul, amiright?) but it's honestly the perfect size for 2 meals.

Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,148,342,5.0,12/10/2016,"I have to admit, when my wife was telling me about this, I was really asking myself ""why does she want to go to some commercial pizza joint?"" And for anyone wondering the same, I promise you it is not that at all. It's not that when you look from outside and it looks like fast food, or when you finally sit down and it looks like dennys. None of that matters when it EATS like a fine dining establishment. I looked at the menu confused by all the innovative ideas, combinations that were unheard of to me previously. An avocado club egg roll?? Had to have it. And it was GREAT! All the best things about a club sandwich deep fried inside an egg roll served with two ranch dressings and all beautifully plated. Entree: I went with the chicken milanese, which unfortunately wasn't like milanese at all but more of a full chicken breast with arugula salad, topped with fresh parm. You squeeze the lemon juice on top and it all meets for a delicious bite every time. My wife had the Kung pao shrimp pasta that she is very much a fan of. Now while I am not a fan of Kung pao.. I was very much a fan of this dish. It's sweet, roasted chili peppers, short of the peanuts(I'm glad) but overall a great idea. Butter cake. Butter cake. Butter cake. Butter cake. I don't care what you're doing. If you're reading this review, if you're near 28th, in the Manhattan area or you can take a train, get. The. Butter cake.

Especially the Avocado Egg Rolls, Cremini Mushroom Spaghetti (they did forget the mushroom once, and yes, meaning I've ordered it more than once), and the Salmon! I've had the frozen lemonades, but the ice was not fully blended. I needed to constantly stir the drink to have it similar to 7-Eleven style. A little too sweet, I think. But oh well, I keep ordering it! But it has room for upgrade, I believe. Overall, a happy place for a happy family.

Jim D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,,2.0,7/31/2017,"Have been going there for years and have seen the quality of service drop lower and lower. The last few times it's been a struggle to get what we ordered and in a timely fashion. Tonight the server completely forgot to place part of our order and it took asking at least three or four other staff to finally the the order straightened out and get our food. This took roughly an half hour to get our appetizers and no, the restaurant was not packed or busy. The manager graciously took care of our check (which is the only reason for two stars instead of one) and good thing, the food we eventually received was disappointing. The tortilla chips were greasy, my salmon was slightly mealy and flavorless. Only my sons pizza turned out satisfactory.  Truly a shame with what has happened there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2
Geraldine A.,"Manhattan, NY",43,24,15,2.0,6/30/2017,"This review is specifically about JUSTINE. The rudest waitress ever. My friend and I went for dinner last night and we're greeted by the nicest hostess ever and we were happy and expected the same service from everyone... but boy we were wrong. Justine cannot smile and has a straight face. She has no patience for customers reading the menu and we felt rushed to make a decision with her sighing and attitude. We were not even done with our meal and dear Justine comes to our table with the tab .. I don't know where she got her training from but this was just rude and unprofessional.. we almost didn't order our desert because of her attitude but we did anyway because we were hungry and love to eat. So here Justine was , giving us terrible service that made us feel unwelcome and like she wanted to get rid of us. When we finally get our tab we debated whether  rude Justine deserved a tip ..  but we're not bad people so we left her the 20% that she clearly did not deserve. we've been to CPK locations in Los Ángeles  and Boston and we have never experienced such terrible service. She seemed miserable and treated us terribly.. you cannot represent a business with this attitude because you will make them look bad and make new customers not want to come back. I hope you enjoyed your 20% tip that you didn't deserve. I understand we have days when we're tired or maybe just having other  situations but  it's not the customers fault.

You can substitute for wheat dough instead and it was still delicious, and 20 calories less (whatever, I'm eating pizza.) You can also get thin crust but I think its $1.50 more.

Ladiny P.,"New York, NY",80,51,227,4.0,10/7/2015,"I have been to this restaurant many times and the customer service and food varied by the branches I went. Personally, my favorite so far has been the one on Park Ave and 30th street. The service given by the waitress and the host was very friendly, and they even told us how to get complimentary small plates.  I came here with my best friend after doing a couple of hours of volunteer work around the community. When we arrived, the host took us to our table and told us about their loyalty card; once you sign up you get a complimentary small plate or flatbread, so we signed up for it. Then the waitress arrived and told us if we checked in on Facebook, we would get complimentary guac and chips. Both came out and they were completely delicious. My all time favorite dish from this establishment has got to be the Thai Crunch Salad. The salad contains crisp vegetables (mainly lettuce) and fresh cilantro with chicken and crushed peanuts, wontons and rice crips. The salad is tossed with peanut sauce dressing. I completely love the crunch of all the components of the salad as well as the hint of spice from the peanut dressing. Every time I come here I always ordered the thai crunch salad (half portion: $11.99) In terms of the pizza, I am particularly not a big fan of the pizza, because it does lack the tomato sauce and I found the dough of the pizza to be too thick that it overtook the whole taste of the pizza; an uneven balance of toppings and dough Food: kind of pricey ($11-$25), salad portion is worth the price, food wait: 10-15 min Atmosphere: pretty upscale, one of the fanciest pizza joints I have been to, but modern and casual Service: This establishment exactly, very friendly hosts and waitresses, cater to your needs even when you have an issue with the check.

Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",251,520,882,4.0,2/12/2015,"California Kitchen serves pretty good gourmet style pizza. The crust is light and has a bit of a puffed crisp bubble, light in chewiness but not rubber chewy with a tad of crisp to it, just right in pretzel meets bread. The rest of the dough/bread part of the pizza is thin and soft; it is incorporated well with the top ingredients, well the cheese mostly. The cheese is of a decent flavor, not over powering with milk flavor, just right. It's good pizza. Had the Habanero Pizza and one out of ten bites, I detected a SMIDGEN of hotness. Habanero? Rename it please. The flavorful indeed the pizza is but mixed in with the other ingredients it tasted more like a ceviche pizza with the onions and cilantro. It had red pieced of delicious chicken that were very soft, stringy and just right. I didn't burn my mouth but at the very least spice up a pizza called Habanero a bit. Over all the pizza was flavorful. And I thought the pizza was good. Only complaint and I know the area I am in but: $14 and change not considering tax and tip for a six slice pie of 10 inch tininess. You BETTER call yourself gourmet pizza. The seating is well provided and the place is big. The ambience reminds me of a business meets fast food type of place and definitely fits into Manhattan. It could fall anywhere between 3.5 stars for overall enjoyability but I'll be nice to bump up to 4 stars for a tasty Ceviche Pizza, I mean Habanero Pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=40

For the most part, the menu is the same as at any CPK. The chicken piccata is excellent and so is the spaghetti bolognese. For first-time visitors, the cheese and tomato pizza is a simple and reliable option. Their beverage menu is huge: everything from caffeine free Diet Coke to sangria. They don't have a lot of beer on draft, but they do have Blue Moon, Bud Light, Samuel Adams, and (in an effort to support local beer) Brooklyn Lager. Customer service for both eat-in and take-out is strong. Their major downside is the price: a more expensive pasta dish and a beer can run up to 20 dollars.

If I wanted my pizza any other way than the New York style I'm use to, this would be it. When we walked in, I already like the ambiance of the place. So we started with the spinach and artichoke dip, which I highly recommend. The tortilla chips were warm and the dip was hot, which isn't a easy combination to find sometimes. Then we ordered 3 pizzas, a wild mushroom, hawaiian and garlic chicken. I loved all of it! They were just the right amount of flavor, not overly salty or bland and the crust was nice and crunchy.  We also ordered a cream pesto chicken penne. I think we all expected it to come with a somewhat thick sauce. The penne wasn't cooked long enough either because it was a tad on the hard side. Overall, it was a hard and dry dish. They're called pizza kitchen, not pasta kitchen, so I suggest sticking to their pizza!

I noticed this location on Park Avenue and decided to try it out. I tried the BBQ Chicken pizza. After ordering, it came out in like 10 minutes and  it was very good. It was not the best pizza I've had, but it was good. Their pizza is alot like those thin crust pizzas Italian places serve. All the pizzas were around $12-$13. One man can finish off one of these pizzas, or two people with smaller appetites could definitely share one.  Service was so-so. The staff seemed pretty indifferent.

T H.,"Hudson, NJ",4,18,,3.0,9/22/2014,"Usually go there with a friend in the evenings, but decided to go there with another friend during lunch hours, and it was a totally different environment. First off, the portions were very small. We ordered the chips and guac, which there were about 10 chips on the plate. When I go in the evenings, the friend I go with knows the crew there, so maybe that had something to do with us getting better portions. We ordered our entrees, I ordered a salad which was okay, and my friend ordered fettucine which looked like it was for a five year old. I felt bad, because it was my friend's birthday, and I was hyping the place up. In any case, we ate our entrees. This is where the service got a bit spotty. Our waiter David was nice enough. We asked for a desert menu, and then we decided what we wanted. The waiter brought our desserts, but also put the check on the table as if to rush us out! We hadn't even started dessert yet! The other table got its dessert at the same time, but didn't get a check and a ""Thanks So Much"" slapped on it. My friend was a bit annoyed at that, because nobody else got their check put on the table. We are pretty sensitive to this, because it's happened to us a lot, the questionable service, errors, etc. Nobody wants to ""go there"", but when things keep happening, you have to wonder why you are being treated differently from others?  Usually when a restaurant does this, they want you to get the hell out, lol. The place wasn't crowded at all, and I don't think we were being weird or obnoxious. I won't go into what I think the reason was, because you can probably guess (hint: my friend and myself are African American men, lol). Anyhooz, the questionable afternoon service aside, the food was tasty, and the dessert was amazing! I recommend the place over all. Maybe it was just an off day? Maybe just go in the evenings?

The flatbread had lots of sage on it, that's not a problem if you're really into that particular flavor, but I'm not so I didn't really enjoy this too much. The pizza was good but the portion was small. The mango mojito looked just like a regular mojito so I actually forgot it was supposed to be mango. It seems like they just added a ""mango syrup"" to the drink and called it a day, it didn't taste good so I would advise to stick to a regular mojito. The bill came out to about $35.

It's close to my office and it was one of those times when I had no hankering for anything in particular. Both times I got the same pizza - the original BBQ Chicken. It's actually one of my favorites here. BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, mozzarella, BBQ chicken, red onions and cilantro. I like almost anything with BBQ sauce on it! This is a pretty decent pie and I easily finish it by myself, then pass out in my office in a food coma. Not a bad price at around $13 but a bit on the high side for chain store pizza. One qualm I have about this place is that there are no lunch specials. Ever. Sheesh - you would think being in a main stretch of Park Ave South where there are a ton of offices and working people they would give us a little something of a deal. Maybe that is why it always seems mostly empty during lunch time. There are a lot of other options in the area for a cheaper lunch. This location is quite large and spacious with plenty of seating. Service is ok if a bit distant. Sometimes you need to flag them down or wait a bit for someone to come by. The menu is pretty big here and offers much more than pizzas, such as pastas, salads, soups, tacos, sandwiches, desserts, etc. It's a totally casual dining spot and they also serve beer and wine.

The wild mushroom was my personal favorite (get the truffle oil!). The rest of the pizzas were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The slices are also a little small, so you might want about four slices to get full. I have to dock points though and I'm not sure if this is because we just had bad luck, but the wait was abysmally long. We ordered our first two pizzas and received them about half an hour later. Because we knew they took a while, we ordered the second set of two just before we started to eat, but we had finished eating in about ten minutes and still had to wait another thirty to forty-five minutes for our pizzas to arrive. It's a little disappointing when you're waiting to get the rest of the pizzas so you can just pay the bill and go already. Overall, the atmosphere seems pretty good for groups and the pizzas are quite decent. It may have been that we had bad luck with the wait, but if it normally takes that long for food to come, I'd recommend just having pizza elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=140

I had the kiwi soda, which was okay...too much ice diluted my drink. Everyone's was like ""why's your drink green?"" Which really does look out of the ordinary, see picture. For appetizers, we had the Garlic Cheese Focaccia with Checca. It was okay alone, but it was really good with the tomatoes. Almost all of us ordered a pizza, which seemed like we've been starving or something. We've had the cheeseburger pizza, original bbq chicken pizza, vegetarian with japanese eggplant pizza, bbq chicken with applewood smoked bacon pizza, the Margherita, and chipotle chicken pizza.

The half portion turned out to be enough to fill me up. It contained spinach, grilled peach slices, pecans, cranberries, feta cheese, grilled chicken (for extra), and a very light dressing. I thought the extras that came with the salad were more than enough; every bite was flavorful and even made me forget that I was eating ""rabbit food""!

David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2,4.0,8/11/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen has surprised me. The chain has unveiled a new look and expanded menu that goes well beyond pizza. The best part - you don't need to travel to California to check it out. Head to CPK in Midtown to eat your way through the reimagined menu and check out the new rustic interior. I was invited in to CPK a few weeks ago and had an incredible time. The new menu still has the traditional pizzas you know and love (can you say BBQ chicken?), but new menu options are available in every category. We're talking everything from Maine Lobster Flatbread to Fire-Grilled Ribeye to Hearth-Roasted Halibut all showcasing seasonally inspired ingredients. These new entrees certainly don't shy away from flavor. The halibut was incredibly flavorful and sat on a bed of grilled asparagus, butternut squash and baby kale. The roasted garlic chicken consisted of crispy-skin chicken breasts in a lemon garlic sauce with roasted fingerling potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and herbs. I'm even going to go as far to say this chicken dish was some of the best chicken I've ever had... ever. Wait a minute, is this really California Pizza Kitchen? The drink menu has been reinvented as well. Creative new beverages include hand-crafted cocktails made from fresh fruits, juices, purees, and herbs. A must-try is the California Roots, a drink made of vodka, avocado, mint and agave. Apparently, you can put avocado in a drink.  Hopefully I've now convinced you that the food is good, really good. Well, the interior mirrors the reimagined menu. Walking into California Pizza Kitchen, I didn't feel like I was at another chain restaurant. I felt like this place belonged in NYC. There are new oak floors, tabletops and chairs made from reclaimed wood and stone countertops. Fabrics used for seating are from recycled materials and the restaurant features a natural herb garden. Artwork on the walls features local New York landmarks for a neighborhood feel. Additionally, the open floorplan has an open kitchen where guests can watch as food is prepared from scratch and artisan pizzas are hand-tossed and cooked in the open-hearth oven. If this is what chain restaurants are turning into, sign me up. California Pizza Kitchen in Midtown has certainly exceeded the ""pizza"" in its name to become a neighborhood space to relax with some good drinks and even better food.

Sahil R.,"Manhattan, NY",522,53,46,4.0,6/9/2016,Is it sad that I went to a chain restaurant when I'm in NYC? Nope because I live here and sometimes I just crave the chain restaurant taste. I've only been to this franchise once in Cali so I had to come back even if it was in NYC. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza and it was delicious. It's served with a cilantro lime sauce which I loved dipping my slices in. No appetizers really needed here as they serve you bread before hand (although the apps did sound good). Even the wine was great which I didn't expect considering it was a 40 dollar bottle. I also know nothing about wine so don't ask me. The only knock I had was our server took FOREVER to give us our card back and I was trying to catch me some NBA Finals action...they only had one small TV near the bar. I'm a patient person but there's a point where I even notice when something is just taking too long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=60

It boggles my mind how this place can stay open in NY. Not really sure how I ended up in here (Ok, my friends make horrendous decisions when they pick places), but I would never go back. The pizza crust was like warmed pita bread - how they manage to do this in NY is beyond me. The toppings were crappy and tasted terrible - I tried quite a few just to be sure. Oh, and everything on the menu somehow manages to be 1000+ calories, even the field greens salad!! IZ YEW SURRIOUS DOGGY? If you're going to eat unhealthy, it should at least taste GOOD.

ALWAYS get the honey wheat crust. It's far superior. The salad with the all the same roasted veggies on top is a much healthier, and just as tasty, option. It's massive, btw. The most decadent pizza I order is the pear, gorgonzola, caramalized onions (and I think there are nuts involved). Oh lordy, so good! Ok, now I'm hungry. My friend is addicted to their Tortilla soup.

Last week I go with a ""COMPLIMENTARY"" artichoke and spinach dip coupon. All was great and good food as usual, when at the end the COMPLIMENTARY dish is only discounted for $8 ($2 difference which is no big deal-but it's the principle of it being COMPLIMENTARY). After I brought it up to the waiter's attention he goes and comes back, explaining to me that the corporate button allows them to discount it that way and that there is nothing he can do. Corporate what? Doesn't what?? I request the manager, and here (s)he comes...flapping his hands, upset as ever, but a better hip swing than I who wore a 5inch heel.  Starts explaining that the reason it only discounted $8 dollars is because NYC is more expensive than other CPK places in the country, and something else...bla bla bla bla bla...is all I hear since I am ultimately AT LUNCH and only got so much time. Seeing that he won't stop I cut him off saying OK no problem I'll just discount my $2 from the check..and I told him that I spent 8 years in the service industry and I know all about it...he then gets a shit fit, almost cried, doing the head snake...and told me that I need not be rude to him, and that I am basically a horrible customer...buuu huuu..I mean SERIOUSLY???

How about YOU pick them off.  Let's get to the quality of the food. The Greek pizza (with the thin crust) tasted dreadful. The crust had a sort of cumin spice, and it was a blank crust with a handful of small pieces of cucumber and tomato on it with a tiny drizzle of incredibly low-quality tzaziki.

I've never wanted to be in a situation where I was complimenting another state's pizza, but, credit where credit is due. The pizza at CPK is pretty good, it's different from NY pizza, but still good nonetheless and if you just can't be the kind of person to eat pizza from California, the other items on the menu are good as well. The crust is nice and thin, but still fluffy and is tasty. I ordered the Margarita pizza and was surprised at how tasty the cheese and sauce were.

And my girlfriend hands our server her debit card as well as her CPK ""Pizza Rewards"" card.

Kelly B.,"San Diego, CA",234,396,799,4.0,6/28/2009,"When I was a kid I loved California Pizza Kitchen's Chinese Chicken Salad (and hated their pizza), so once I went vegetarian I never returned. But recently after waiting 20 minutes for a table at Vezzo my co-workers and I moved on to a pizza place where we knew we could get a table: CPK! I rarely eat at chain restaurants (I'm not adverse to them, but they tend to be inconveniently located for non-tourist) so I'm not use to some of the common amenities - like the gigantic tables, plush seating and a peaceful environment! I'm so use to sitting on top of my neighbors in uncomfortable folding chairs at tables too small to hold 2 dinner plates... this place seemed weird... we felt so far away from each other we were practically yelling. Even so, the waiter was the required amount of friendliness and the dining room and open kitchen are immaculately clean (also uncomfortably unusual). While I do wish they have some sort of lunch special, the pizzas are bready and large and lasted me two days. I ordered the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza on honey wheat crust ($12.99). The caramelized pears and onions with hazelnuts mingle under a cheesy blanket of gorgonzola, fontina and mozzarella cheeses - all of which hides under a creamy dressed field greens salad! It's a pizza and a salad for the price of a pizza; I love a deal! I traded a few pieces of my pizza for some of my boss's Goat Cheese with Roasted Peppers ($11.99) which is an equally delicious pie of goat cheese, peppers, eggplant, mozzarella and caramelized onions.

Cassandra B.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,37,,5.0,3/25/2011,"When I first heard of California Pizza Kitchen, images and taste of UNO's chicago grill came to mind. However, these two restaurants are quite different. Not that I have anything against UNO's but I definitely prefer CPK. As far as chains go, CPK is aces. Good food, good service, and a nice setting to boot. Talking of setting, the decor reminds me vaguely of ruby tuesday in that it has a modern, almost upscale appearance. I'm quite pleased to report it's not flashy or cheesy like some other chain restaurants. Being that I love avocados, california cuisine is ideal because they use them in a lot of their dishes.  When I went to CPK, I opted for a sandwich & soup combo (you can also get a sandwich paired with salad). Specifically, I had the california club sandwich along with the tuscan white bean minestrone. Both were great and just the right amount of food--you know it was filling enough that you're not starving a hour later, but it wasn't so much food  that you feel like you need to be forklifted out of the restuarant! lol. It was also a great deal at about $11.  My friend had the jambalaya pasta. OMG...just the creativity of the dish alone impressed me, but when I had a bite or 2 from his plate, I was just as impressed, if not even more so, with the taste! However, at a whopping 1138 calories , I could never swing ordering that dish for myself!  While of course this place is known for pizza, I have unfortunately never gotten the chance to try one of the pizzas as of yet.

After it was ready it tasted OK i mean its frozen pizza cant expect much out of it right..... Meet up my friend and went to CPK it was close we both where hungry, we sit down: The music is so OLD like 90's easy listing some of the songs are a bit depressing but what ever.  Ordered Mountain Dew, and A  root beer, both where mostly flat and the glasses where full of ice and not so much of the actual drink. Ordered pizza, one Hawaiian pizza, one Buffalo chicken, - the pizza was about 10 inches in diameter - aka personal pizza. The pizza came in about 15 - 20 which was kind of fast in my opinion, so my hopes of something great was kinda squashed.  First bite into the pizza was nothing special tasted like a re-heated pizza the crust was mushy, and tasted like something that can be re-heated. Honestly not the best pizza not the best drinks and all for about 20$ a person which is to much for not so good food in a place that ""specializes"" in just pizza, if the price was loser then maybe i would give it a higher rating but price for food is not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=240

George I.,"New York, NY",2,11,,3.0,5/23/2007,"If you have eaten at one before this review is for you because I am not going to talk much about the food or decor. It's a chain. You know that.  This review is about how my girlfriend and I randomly walked into this one and what happened over the next few hours.  It was completely unplanned. Even if it was planned, we would never admit it. We walked past it once, laughed that there was one in New York, how could people be suckered into going, no way in New York City, etc. and then found ourselves asking for a table for 2. I have no idea why we walked in. We never went to one in California.  Once inside, we were informed that this location opened up 2 days prior. We knew better than to order pizza, so we got the Greek and Chinese Chicken Salads. Maybe they are called Mediterranean and Asian as to not insult anyone (or insult as many as possible). I don't remember exactly.  After long finishing our appetizer, my girlfriend asked me ""Have we been here for 2 hours?"" We noticed that a table next to us got their salads, but we sat 15 minutes before them. Then I noticed that another couple was eating too and remembered that there was a different party at that table when we sat.  ""Dude!"" Dude checks back with us after seeing my frowny face and says there was a delay in the kitchen. I don't buy it because only our food was delayed. Maybe the delays are now customer specific. However,  I never complain before I get my food. Spit factor.  Finally a woman brings us our food and apologizes. She explains that our order was accidentally processed and canceled and that dessert would be on the house. Manager. As the saying goes, it's not about making mistakes, it's about how well one responds to a mistake. Free dessert makes up for many things. We had the apple cobbler a la mode. Yeah! CPK rules.  By the time we got the check it had been 2 hours.  Nice touches were that they kept our doggie bag in a fridge until we were ready to leave and took the salads off the bill.

And for anyone wondering the same, I promise you it is not that at all. It's not that when you look from outside and it looks like fast food, or when you finally sit down and it looks like dennys. None of that matters when it EATS like a fine dining establishment. I looked at the menu confused by all the innovative ideas, combinations that were unheard of to me previously. An avocado club egg roll?? Had to have it. And it was GREAT! All the best things about a club sandwich deep fried inside an egg roll served with two ranch dressings and all beautifully plated. Entree: I went with the chicken milanese, which unfortunately wasn't like milanese at all but more of a full chicken breast with arugula salad, topped with fresh parm. You squeeze the lemon juice on top and it all meets for a delicious bite every time. My wife had the Kung pao shrimp pasta that she is very much a fan of. Now while I am not a fan of Kung pao.. I was very much a fan of this dish. It's sweet, roasted chili peppers, short of the peanuts(I'm glad) but overall a great idea. Butter cake. Butter cake. Butter cake. Butter cake. I don't care what you're doing. If you're reading this review, if you're near 28th, in the Manhattan area or you can take a train, get. The. Butter cake.

Lydia W.,"Douglaston, United States",70,30,5,3.0,3/6/2017,"I walk by this CPK maybe twice a day and have always shuddered at the thought of a chain restaurant having a posted 'C' rating in Murray Hill. One of my friends suggested we go for a quick Friday lunch and I spent too long looking online for a CPK meal option that would be semi-healthy AND wasn't ridiculous for the listed price. The location was relatively empty and the noise level was down to a quiet chatter. We were quickly seated in a booth that had a great view of the pizza oven and the takeout counter. Not too shabby! Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and Julia, our lovely server. Julia came by regularly to take our orders and walk me through the lunch duo menu. Wanting to get in some protein for lunch, I inquired about adding shrimp to my small salad. My bad for wanting to treat myself to some protein, eh? It's really not the location's fault, but I believe it was 6 shrimp for $5 or vice versa. Either way, I couldn't quite justify that price for such a small quantity of shrimp when it's about $6/pound for shrimp at my local grocery store. I ordered a lunch duo of a small Caesar salad and Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley soup. For lunch, it would do and although my dining companion picked up the check this time, I wouldn't find myself paying over $7 for a cup of soup and a side salad (without a real protein).  My croutons had a taste that was reminded me a lot of star anise. I'm not sure if CPK buys their croutons from a supplier or intentionally overseasons them, but the taste was too strong.  My dining companion ordered two appetizers/starters of White Corn Guacamole and a dumpling dish. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal choices. It's probably a personal preference, but dumplings at a chain pizza restaurant? I can see how chains like CPK do well in the suburbs, but it's difficult being a jack of all trades. I'm not sure I would be back to try other items on the menu, because the price doesn't come close to justifying the quality of food. The menu lacks a cohesive theme other than 'mid-level bar food' or 'casual lunch spot.' For the price they're charging, Midtown has no shortage of even other chain restaurants that can also hit those notes for less money. That being said, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20

Recently I observed one of their delivery men riding his bicycle on the sidewalk, which was dangerous to himself as well as to pedestrians, and also illegal in New York City (source:  ). I called the California Pizza Kitchen to find out why they tolerated this behavior, and asked to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for nine minutes. Then somebody picked up the telephone. I identified myself as a neighbor and asked why the delivery man was riding his bicycle on the sidewalk. She said that I'd need to speak with a manager, then put me on hold again. A minute later, she or somebody else disconnected me. This is not a nice way to treat somebody, or even an acceptable way.

Still, it always works as a lunch spot with co-workers and they offer a wide range of menu items that can please even the pickiest of eaters or those with dietary restrictions (hint: gluten-free pizza). I also rather enjoy their pastas, despite that there's gotta be a crapload of sodium and preservatives in those sauces (or maybe because of?).

I was really torn between 3 or 4 stars - but they pulled ahead and got that 4th star and this is why... _________________________________________ Ambience: It's a big, open space which lends itself to be good for group outings, but also has a warm and inviting vibe thanks to their simple decor and relaxing, West Coast like color palette.  Service: Our waiter was friendly, efficient and helpful. Everyone we engaged with was really nice, no problems with service here for me. Menu: For a place called, ""California Pizza Kitchen"", I was pretty impressed with the diversity on their menu. People who eat gluten-free, are vegetarian, are watching their weight and are looking to throw down and pig out will all feel welcomed here! Want pizza? Of course it's here! Craving tacos or pasta instead? Sure thing! Sides? Options galore! Everything is reasonably priced and servings are generous - these are a few of my favorite things! :D Food: My boss and one of my coworkers both opted for the California Club Original Hand-tossed pizza. It features Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, arugula, fresh torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo...essentially this was a very nicely sized pizza on top of a salad. They were both happy with the portion but both agrees that the dressing was sparse and the arugula used was a tad on the drier side. I ordered their White Pizza which came with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic. My pizza was insanely decadent, rich and amazingly satisfying...then again with so much cheese and these types of ingredients it's really hard to mess up.  On a whim I also asked our waiter if they would happen to have any hot sauce and to my delight he said, ""sure, would you be okay with Cholula sauce?"" OHHHHHMAGAHHHHH WOULD I!!! Lol. This ladies and gents, is what catapulted California Pizza Kitchen into 4 Yelp-star land! _________________________________________ In short I would totally return here if in the neighborhood (which doesn't have that many good food selections to boot) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty sit down meal in the culinary wasteland that is (especially this part) of midtown/Flatiron.

We were offered a dessert menu which we declined. While the food was very good the service was lacking.  I did tip 20 percent thinking maybe he was new or inexperienced or busy but in all honesty I've had better experiences in diners.

Ladiny P.,"New York, United States",80,51,227,4.0,7/10/2015,"I have been to this restaurant many times and the customer service and food varied by the branches I went. Personally, my favorite so far has been the one on Park Ave and 30th street. The service given by the waitress and the host was very friendly, and they even told us how to get complimentary small plates.  I came here with my best friend after doing a couple of hours of volunteer work around the community. When we arrived, the host took us to our table and told us about their loyalty card; once you sign up you get a complimentary small plate or flatbread, so we signed up for it. Then the waitress arrived and told us if we checked in on Facebook, we would get complimentary guac and chips. Both came out and they were completely delicious. My all time favorite dish from this establishment has got to be the Thai Crunch Salad. The salad contains crisp vegetables (mainly lettuce) and fresh cilantro with chicken and crushed peanuts, wontons and rice crips. The salad is tossed with peanut sauce dressing. I completely love the crunch of all the components of the salad as well as the hint of spice from the peanut dressing. Every time I come here I always ordered the thai crunch salad (half portion: $11.99) In terms of the pizza, I am particularly not a big fan of the pizza, because it does lack the tomato sauce and I found the dough of the pizza to be too thick that it overtook the whole taste of the pizza; an uneven balance of toppings and dough Food: kind of pricey ($11-$25), salad portion is worth the price, food wait: 10-15 min Atmosphere: pretty upscale, one of the fanciest pizza joints I have been to, but modern and casual Service: This establishment exactly, very friendly hosts and waitresses, cater to your needs even when you have an issue with the check.

Andrew S.,"Queens, United States",251,520,882,4.0,12/2/2015,"California Kitchen serves pretty good gourmet style pizza. The crust is light and has a bit of a puffed crisp bubble, light in chewiness but not rubber chewy with a tad of crisp to it, just right in pretzel meets bread. The rest of the dough/bread part of the pizza is thin and soft; it is incorporated well with the top ingredients, well the cheese mostly. The cheese is of a decent flavor, not over powering with milk flavor, just right. It's good pizza. Had the Habanero Pizza and one out of ten bites, I detected a SMIDGEN of hotness. Habanero? Rename it please. The flavorful indeed the pizza is but mixed in with the other ingredients it tasted more like a ceviche pizza with the onions and cilantro. It had red pieced of delicious chicken that were very soft, stringy and just right. I didn't burn my mouth but at the very least spice up a pizza called Habanero a bit. Over all the pizza was flavorful. And I thought the pizza was good. Only complaint and I know the area I am in but: $14 and change not considering tax and tip for a six slice pie of 10 inch tininess. You BETTER call yourself gourmet pizza. The seating is well provided and the place is big. The ambience reminds me of a business meets fast food type of place and definitely fits into Manhattan. It could fall anywhere between 3.5 stars for overall enjoyability but I'll be nice to bump up to 4 stars for a tasty Ceviche Pizza, I mean Habanero Pizza.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=40

The service at this location was really friendly and efficient (I've always found excellent service at CPK, but it's particularly good at this location). As with other CPKs, the menu has a wide range of options beyond pizza, so it's a safe choice for large groups and picky eaters. I've also found quality to be consistent across the chain so I was, as always, very happy with my experience at this spot. Favorites: I particularly love the lettuce wrap appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza. The pasta with bolognese sauce is another favorite; the sauce is incredibly thick and full of meat!

I know a lot of people aren't keen on chains but I really like their super thin crust pizza here.  My buddy had a barbecue chicken pizza that was good, but it had a thicker crust and could not touch the Meat Cravers.   My margarita was good but not that strong.  My friend's Stella was very reasonably priced.  The red velvet cake was great.

David B.,"New York, United States",59,140,2,4.0,11/8/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen has surprised me. The chain has unveiled a new look and expanded menu that goes well beyond pizza. The best part - you don't need to travel to California to check it out. Head to CPK in Midtown to eat your way through the reimagined menu and check out the new rustic interior. I was invited in to CPK a few weeks ago and had an incredible time. The new menu still has the traditional pizzas you know and love (can you say BBQ chicken?), but new menu options are available in every category. We're talking everything from Maine Lobster Flatbread to Fire-Grilled Ribeye to Hearth-Roasted Halibut all showcasing seasonally inspired ingredients. These new entrees certainly don't shy away from flavor. The halibut was incredibly flavorful and sat on a bed of grilled asparagus, butternut squash and baby kale. The roasted garlic chicken consisted of crispy-skin chicken breasts in a lemon garlic sauce with roasted fingerling potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and herbs. I'm even going to go as far to say this chicken dish was some of the best chicken I've ever had... ever. Wait a minute, is this really California Pizza Kitchen? The drink menu has been reinvented as well. Creative new beverages include hand-crafted cocktails made from fresh fruits, juices, purees, and herbs. A must-try is the California Roots, a drink made of vodka, avocado, mint and agave. Apparently, you can put avocado in a drink.  Hopefully I've now convinced you that the food is good, really good. Well, the interior mirrors the reimagined menu. Walking into California Pizza Kitchen, I didn't feel like I was at another chain restaurant. I felt like this place belonged in NYC. There are new oak floors, tabletops and chairs made from reclaimed wood and stone countertops. Fabrics used for seating are from recycled materials and the restaurant features a natural herb garden. Artwork on the walls features local New York landmarks for a neighborhood feel. Additionally, the open floorplan has an open kitchen where guests can watch as food is prepared from scratch and artisan pizzas are hand-tossed and cooked in the open-hearth oven. If this is what chain restaurants are turning into, sign me up. California Pizza Kitchen in Midtown has certainly exceeded the ""pizza"" in its name to become a neighborhood space to relax with some good drinks and even better food.

We were not even done with our meal and dear Justine comes to our table with the tab .. I don't know where she got her training from but this was just rude and unprofessional.. we almost didn't order our desert because of her attitude but we did anyway because we were hungry and love to eat. So here Justine was , giving us terrible service that made us feel unwelcome and like she wanted to get rid of us. When we finally get our tab we debated whether  rude Justine deserved a tip ..  but we're not bad people so we left her the 20% that she clearly did not deserve. we've been to CPK locations in Los Ángeles  and Boston and we have never experienced such terrible service. She seemed miserable and treated us terribly.. you cannot represent a business with this attitude because you will make them look bad and make new customers not want to come back.

Lee P.,"New York, United States",255,103,4,3.0,1/8/2015,Went here recently with a friend and unfortunately we seemed to choose that time on a Sunday afternoon that could be tactfully called 'family time'. What this means is multiple tables started filling up around us with screaming kids under the age of 5. We escaped the first family by asking to be moved only to have another huge ensemble swiftly move in to our new location.  That in mind I deducted two stars for ambiance:) The food itself was great.....no complaints there and the service was excellent.

We ordered the thai chicken pizza & the bianco flatbread.  The flatbread was pretty good, albeit slightly too oily. Then again, it has truffle oil, so can't really complain.  I liked the thai chicken pizza, but it wasn't really a legitimate Thai taste. I liked the scallions, bean sprouts, carrots but the peanut sauce was a little off. I still thought it was pretty good though. Surprisingly, I didn't think the chicken was necessary. What I really needed was some sriracha...

I know its a chain, but its a pretty good one. I used to go to California and I would always look forward to CPK (in particular, the one in South Coast Plaza). Its also one of my favorite go-to spots in the airports. The Original BBQ Chicken pizza is the best. I highly highly recommend it. You can substitute for wheat dough instead and it was still delicious, and 20 calories less (whatever, I'm eating pizza.) You can also get thin crust but I think its $1.50 more.

I noticed this location on Park Avenue and decided to try it out. I tried the BBQ Chicken pizza. After ordering, it came out in like 10 minutes and  it was very good. It was not the best pizza I've had, but it was good. Their pizza is alot like those thin crust pizzas Italian places serve. All the pizzas were around $12-$13. One man can finish off one of these pizzas, or two people with smaller appetites could definitely share one.  Service was so-so. The staff seemed pretty indifferent.

T H.,"Hudson, United States",4,18,,3.0,22/9/2014,"Usually go there with a friend in the evenings, but decided to go there with another friend during lunch hours, and it was a totally different environment. First off, the portions were very small. We ordered the chips and guac, which there were about 10 chips on the plate. When I go in the evenings, the friend I go with knows the crew there, so maybe that had something to do with us getting better portions. We ordered our entrees, I ordered a salad which was okay, and my friend ordered fettucine which looked like it was for a five year old. I felt bad, because it was my friend's birthday, and I was hyping the place up. In any case, we ate our entrees. This is where the service got a bit spotty. Our waiter David was nice enough. We asked for a desert menu, and then we decided what we wanted. The waiter brought our desserts, but also put the check on the table as if to rush us out! We hadn't even started dessert yet! The other table got its dessert at the same time, but didn't get a check and a ""Thanks So Much"" slapped on it. My friend was a bit annoyed at that, because nobody else got their check put on the table. We are pretty sensitive to this, because it's happened to us a lot, the questionable service, errors, etc. Nobody wants to ""go there"", but when things keep happening, you have to wonder why you are being treated differently from others?  Usually when a restaurant does this, they want you to get the hell out, lol. The place wasn't crowded at all, and I don't think we were being weird or obnoxious. I won't go into what I think the reason was, because you can probably guess (hint: my friend and myself are African American men, lol). Anyhooz, the questionable afternoon service aside, the food was tasty, and the dessert was amazing! I recommend the place over all. Maybe it was just an off day? Maybe just go in the evenings?

The flatbread had lots of sage on it, that's not a problem if you're really into that particular flavor, but I'm not so I didn't really enjoy this too much. The pizza was good but the portion was small. The mango mojito looked just like a regular mojito so I actually forgot it was supposed to be mango. It seems like they just added a ""mango syrup"" to the drink and called it a day, it didn't taste good so I would advise to stick to a regular mojito. The bill came out to about $35.

It's close to my office and it was one of those times when I had no hankering for anything in particular. Both times I got the same pizza - the original BBQ Chicken. It's actually one of my favorites here. BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, mozzarella, BBQ chicken, red onions and cilantro. I like almost anything with BBQ sauce on it! This is a pretty decent pie and I easily finish it by myself, then pass out in my office in a food coma. Not a bad price at around $13 but a bit on the high side for chain store pizza. One qualm I have about this place is that there are no lunch specials. Ever. Sheesh - you would think being in a main stretch of Park Ave South where there are a ton of offices and working people they would give us a little something of a deal. Maybe that is why it always seems mostly empty during lunch time. There are a lot of other options in the area for a cheaper lunch. This location is quite large and spacious with plenty of seating. Service is ok if a bit distant. Sometimes you need to flag them down or wait a bit for someone to come by. The menu is pretty big here and offers much more than pizzas, such as pastas, salads, soups, tacos, sandwiches, desserts, etc. It's a totally casual dining spot and they also serve beer and wine.

For the most part, the menu is the same as at any CPK. The chicken piccata is excellent and so is the spaghetti bolognese. For first-time visitors, the cheese and tomato pizza is a simple and reliable option. Their beverage menu is huge: everything from caffeine free Diet Coke to sangria. They don't have a lot of beer on draft, but they do have Blue Moon, Bud Light, Samuel Adams, and (in an effort to support local beer) Brooklyn Lager. Customer service for both eat-in and take-out is strong. Their major downside is the price: a more expensive pasta dish and a beer can run up to 20 dollars.

OK, we go in, the hostess seats us immediately, the waitress comes right over and is charming, all looks good.

Well, when the waitress comes back to take our orders and I tell her ""Mine will be Gluten free..."" she looks sheepish and tells me that they've recently removed the Gluten free items from the menu.  I ask her what she is talking about and show her the very menu that she handed us and all of the GF references.  There's nothing she can do of course but offer me a salad (I'm *really* tired of that line) so we leave and on the way out I talk to the manager who is polite but has nothing to offer but the BS line ""We're getting new menus 'this week.'""

If I wanted my pizza any other way than the New York style I'm use to, this would be it. When we walked in, I already like the ambiance of the place. So we started with the spinach and artichoke dip, which I highly recommend. The tortilla chips were warm and the dip was hot, which isn't a easy combination to find sometimes. Then we ordered 3 pizzas, a wild mushroom, hawaiian and garlic chicken. I loved all of it! They were just the right amount of flavor, not overly salty or bland and the crust was nice and crunchy.  We also ordered a cream pesto chicken penne. I think we all expected it to come with a somewhat thick sauce. The penne wasn't cooked long enough either because it was a tad on the hard side. Overall, it was a hard and dry dish. They're called pizza kitchen, not pasta kitchen, so I suggest sticking to their pizza!

The slices are also a little small, so you might want about four slices to get full. I have to dock points though and I'm not sure if this is because we just had bad luck, but the wait was abysmally long. We ordered our first two pizzas and received them about half an hour later. Because we knew they took a while, we ordered the second set of two just before we started to eat, but we had finished eating in about ten minutes and still had to wait another thirty to forty-five minutes for our pizzas to arrive. It's a little disappointing when you're waiting to get the rest of the pizzas so you can just pay the bill and go already.

And my girlfriend hands our server her debit card as well as her CPK ""Pizza Rewards"" card. Which has a f*cking CPK logo right on the front.  Except the server, for some reason, decides that she's been handed two debit cards and tries to split the bill, putting half on the ""Pizza Rewards"" card.  And it's a clusterf*ck for about 10 minutes, and the manager stops by the table to say (not in so many words) that the server is an idiot, and some sort of new math has taken place.  But THE CPK LOGO IS RIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE ""PIZZA REWARDS"" CARD?  IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A REWARDS PROGRAM, SHOULDN'T YOUR SERVERS BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THAT ONE OF THE CARDS THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN IS A REWARDS CARD?  YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE CPK LOGO?

I understand that everyone has their own unique tastes, but similarly to how certain restaurants inform you of the level of spiciness in their food, CPK should label this item as disgustingly sweet on the menu. I don't mean to sound so caustic, but between the saccharine and foul-tasting champagne vinaigrette and the exotic (read: confusing and unnecessary) mix of dates, beets, squash and dried cranberries, they really threw me for a loop...

But recently after waiting 20 minutes for a table at Vezzo my co-workers and I moved on to a pizza place where we knew we could get a table: CPK! I rarely eat at chain restaurants (I'm not adverse to them, but they tend to be inconveniently located for non-tourist) so I'm not use to some of the common amenities - like the gigantic tables, plush seating and a peaceful environment! I'm so use to sitting on top of my neighbors in uncomfortable folding chairs at tables too small to hold 2 dinner plates... this place seemed weird... we felt so far away from each other we were practically yelling. Even so, the waiter was the required amount of friendliness and the dining room and open kitchen are immaculately clean (also uncomfortably unusual). While I do wish they have some sort of lunch special, the pizzas are bready and large and lasted me two days. I ordered the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza on honey wheat crust ($12.99). The caramelized pears and onions with hazelnuts mingle under a cheesy blanket of gorgonzola, fontina and mozzarella cheeses - all of which hides under a creamy dressed field greens salad! It's a pizza and a salad for the price of a pizza; I love a deal! I traded a few pieces of my pizza for some of my boss's Goat Cheese with Roasted Peppers ($11.99) which is an equally delicious pie of goat cheese, peppers, eggplant, mozzarella and caramelized onions.

This is the 2nd time eating the BBQ Chicken Pizza, the first time in 2006 and I can't believe that I waited this long to come back to CPK. Everyone enjoyed the food and the service was exceptional.

Danielle O.,"New York, United States",160,63,34,3.0,26/8/2009,"CPK.... We have a love/hate relationship... Food = 5 stars Staff = 1 star Total = 3 stars The salads are one of my favorite dinner choices when I'm out and want to stay in the area. The options are endless... (I get the Waldorf chicken salad... No blue cheese, no candied pecans.... Add extra grapes... Add walnuts... Dressing on the side...) For a picky, healthy eater, it's always a plus to know you can ""have it your way"". HOWEVER, the staff are some of the most annoying, obtrusive, stupid people I've ever met in my entire life. They are the reason I think ""ehhhhhhhh"" when I start to crave that super delicious salad.  I came here one time with a friend to discuss a personal matter that needed to be dealt with seriously and involved in-depth conversing. Our server kept coming over and obtrusively and knowingly interrupting...""ummmm, hey! excuse me??? How ya doin?"" Or even better ""ummm are things okay over here?"" *Cue death stares* ""ummmm I guess you're all busy... just wanted to check on ummmm ya know... see if you're ready to order"" Are you kidding me? You'll know when we're ready because our menus will be open, we will look at them, you'll see us looking at them, then we'll close them and put them on the other side of the table.  On a separate occurrence, our server tried to persuade us to vote a certain way in the presidential election, right before he told me it was ""kinda a pain"" for him to serve me hot tea with lemon and honey. (Too many things to carry 7 ft across the dining room?) Really? I'm pretty sure that's your job! Anyways, the food's good... which is lucky.. because it's really all they have going for them.

Very nice service (I'm only reviewing this chain restaurant because the mgr came by to check on the food and service, which should be, but sadly is not the norm, at any restaurant).  The waitress was a bit intense, but she was very friendly and meant well (in addition to providing some comic value whenever she would walk away). I am a bit surprised there was no line to speak of, but I guess that's the state of the union, when Zimari's $1 slices around the corner are flying out at lunch and this normally (formerly?) buzzing spot is crowded but not overflowing...so don't be scared off by the old rep of waiting for a table.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=220

As for the food, we decided to order a few different dishes and split. We started off with the spinach dip, which was great! A heated dip served with warm tortilla chips?

The pizza crust was like warmed pita bread - how they manage to do this in NY is beyond me. The toppings were crappy and tasted terrible - I tried quite a few just to be sure. Oh, and everything on the menu somehow manages to be 1000+ calories, even the field greens salad!! IZ YEW SURRIOUS DOGGY? If you're going to eat unhealthy, it should at least taste GOOD.

ALWAYS get the honey wheat crust. It's far superior. The salad with the all the same roasted veggies on top is a much healthier, and just as tasty, option. It's massive, btw. The most decadent pizza I order is the pear, gorgonzola, caramalized onions (and I think there are nuts involved). Oh lordy, so good! Ok, now I'm hungry. My friend is addicted to their Tortilla soup.

This particular visit was no different.  Iced Tea.  Garlic Cream Pasta.  And some sourdough bread. I kinda felt bad because I got dragged into a phone call during my entire meal, which caused my food to get cold (sitting under the AC didn't help the situation at all either). As I waited for some water to take with my chocolate souffle, I realized that it wasn't my phone call, but the service was a bit slower than I would have hoped.  My waitress was nice though....and I think at one point during my phone conversation the manager came by just to gesture if my meal was fine.

Last week I go with a ""COMPLIMENTARY"" artichoke and spinach dip coupon. All was great and good food as usual, when at the end the COMPLIMENTARY dish is only discounted for $8 ($2 difference which is no big deal-but it's the principle of it being COMPLIMENTARY). After I brought it up to the waiter's attention he goes and comes back, explaining to me that the corporate button allows them to discount it that way and that there is nothing he can do. Corporate what? Doesn't what?? I request the manager, and here (s)he comes...flapping his hands, upset as ever, but a better hip swing than I who wore a 5inch heel.  Starts explaining that the reason it only discounted $8 dollars is because NYC is more expensive than other CPK places in the country, and something else...bla bla bla bla bla...is all I hear since I am ultimately AT LUNCH and only got so much time. Seeing that he won't stop I cut him off saying OK no problem I'll just discount my $2 from the check..and I told him that I spent 8 years in the service industry and I know all about it...he then gets a shit fit, almost cried, doing the head snake...and told me that I need not be rude to him, and that I am basically a horrible customer...buuu huuu..I mean SERIOUSLY???

Cassandra B.,"Brooklyn, United States",13,37,,5.0,25/3/2011,"When I first heard of California Pizza Kitchen, images and taste of UNO's chicago grill came to mind. However, these two restaurants are quite different. Not that I have anything against UNO's but I definitely prefer CPK. As far as chains go, CPK is aces. Good food, good service, and a nice setting to boot. Talking of setting, the decor reminds me vaguely of ruby tuesday in that it has a modern, almost upscale appearance. I'm quite pleased to report it's not flashy or cheesy like some other chain restaurants. Being that I love avocados, california cuisine is ideal because they use them in a lot of their dishes.  When I went to CPK, I opted for a sandwich & soup combo (you can also get a sandwich paired with salad). Specifically, I had the california club sandwich along with the tuscan white bean minestrone. Both were great and just the right amount of food--you know it was filling enough that you're not starving a hour later, but it wasn't so much food  that you feel like you need to be forklifted out of the restuarant! lol. It was also a great deal at about $11.  My friend had the jambalaya pasta. OMG...just the creativity of the dish alone impressed me, but when I had a bite or 2 from his plate, I was just as impressed, if not even more so, with the taste! However, at a whopping 1138 calories , I could never swing ordering that dish for myself!  While of course this place is known for pizza, I have unfortunately never gotten the chance to try one of the pizzas as of yet.

Meet up my friend and went to CPK it was close we both where hungry, we sit down: The music is so OLD like 90's easy listing some of the songs are a bit depressing but what ever.  Ordered Mountain Dew, and A  root beer, both where mostly flat and the glasses where full of ice and not so much of the actual drink. Ordered pizza, one Hawaiian pizza, one Buffalo chicken, - the pizza was about 10 inches in diameter - aka personal pizza. The pizza came in about 15 - 20 which was kind of fast in my opinion, so my hopes of something great was kinda squashed.  First bite into the pizza was nothing special tasted like a re-heated pizza the crust was mushy, and tasted like something that can be re-heated. Honestly not the best pizza not the best drinks and all for about 20$ a person which is to much for not so good food in a place that ""specializes"" in just pizza, if the price was loser then maybe i would give it a higher rating but price for food is not worth it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=240
Vanessa X.,"Chicago, United States",169,486,,3.0,3/5/2009,"CPK is bustling at lunchtime! The hostess and servers were especially accommodating and friendly and even though we were told that the wait was 25 minutes for a party of 6, they got us a table right away when one was open. The calories on the menu scared us silly, but besides that, the food was savory and we were very satisfied. The place on Park Ave is frequented by a lot of business people during lunch and there are flat screens around for when you want to get your update on CNN. We left at around 2PM but there were still people waiting for tables, so you can imagine how busy the place was! We had this coupon that you had to bring to the restaurant to scratch off, and we discovered that we got a 10% coupon.

We had a couple of pies - chains like bertuccis and pizzeria uno in Massachusetts perhaps serve better pizza - but we also had a pasta dish that was tasty. I'm not going to seriously sit here and intellectualize the cuisine at this restaurant, though I could amuse myself in so doing. It was just a good experience that felt like being in high school again.

Maybe I need a bit of suburban recluse from the big scary city but it felt like a vacation coming in and eating some good ole chain pizza. As always, the pizza's pretty good. I'm sure most people think it sucks in this city but it really is pretty tasty. Good prices, the service was good and I think it's probably a better visit than most NYC located chains. Best suggestion I can make: try the hummus as an appetizer. It's excellent, a bit spicy and the pita is really good.

This is one of those great go to places after a long hard day at the mall, whether in Long Island or NYC. The service can be a little better though.

George I.,"New York, United States",2,11,,3.0,23/5/2007,"If you have eaten at one before this review is for you because I am not going to talk much about the food or decor. It's a chain. You know that.  This review is about how my girlfriend and I randomly walked into this one and what happened over the next few hours.  It was completely unplanned. Even if it was planned, we would never admit it. We walked past it once, laughed that there was one in New York, how could people be suckered into going, no way in New York City, etc. and then found ourselves asking for a table for 2. I have no idea why we walked in. We never went to one in California.  Once inside, we were informed that this location opened up 2 days prior. We knew better than to order pizza, so we got the Greek and Chinese Chicken Salads. Maybe they are called Mediterranean and Asian as to not insult anyone (or insult as many as possible). I don't remember exactly.  After long finishing our appetizer, my girlfriend asked me ""Have we been here for 2 hours?"" We noticed that a table next to us got their salads, but we sat 15 minutes before them. Then I noticed that another couple was eating too and remembered that there was a different party at that table when we sat.  ""Dude!"" Dude checks back with us after seeing my frowny face and says there was a delay in the kitchen. I don't buy it because only our food was delayed. Maybe the delays are now customer specific. However,  I never complain before I get my food. Spit factor.  Finally a woman brings us our food and apologizes. She explains that our order was accidentally processed and canceled and that dessert would be on the house. Manager. As the saying goes, it's not about making mistakes, it's about how well one responds to a mistake. Free dessert makes up for many things. We had the apple cobbler a la mode. Yeah! CPK rules.  By the time we got the check it had been 2 hours.  Nice touches were that they kept our doggie bag in a fridge until we were ready to leave and took the salads off the bill. They gave answer 40.3.C by explaining that they want us to come back.  We may someday.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=240

As we were eating it, we discovered a fly in our salad. I was literally repulsed! The server came took it away, apologized and then the manager came and said sorry but ""this happens"". He was a youngish guy with black framed glasses. What does he mean ""this happens""? This happens because the restaurant does not wash their vegetables??? I was grossed out by the fly but am utterly concerned about the manager's response. ""Oh our greens are organic, so this happens"". That is not not how to make us as customers feel good about CPK's food. We are from NYC and their are tons of great restaurants in NYC, local restaurants, in fact and we just chose CPK on a whim and we now know better. We had the most horrible experience at a restaurant ever! We will not be going back and perhaps the manager should be better trained. Don't you think? This is really unacceptable.
