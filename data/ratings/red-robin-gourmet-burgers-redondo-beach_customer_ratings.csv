FRENCH FRIES TIP OF THE DAY --- Eat half of your burger to consume even more fries, and take the other half to go.    HAPPY HOUR (M-F; 3pm-6pm; 8pm-close) --- Drinks, plenty to choose from, ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 ( ), and appetizers ranging from $3-$7 ( ). SAPPY ADVERTISING --- surrounded everywhere, some funny, some not, and some just lame.  C'mon, new shrimp tacos look/sound good - but you don't LURE shrimp!  ( ), you lay down a net and pull it up silly!  Here's a link on how to catch shrimp:  .  If English is your second language, a 'shrimp lure' is used to catch certain fish. ======================= = UNIQUE LOCATION INFO = ======================= SERVICE --- Theresa, my server on this day (3/29/2012), was nice, but management had her way overloaded.  So much so, she felt she has to apologize to each new table, ""sorry, i am the only one over here.""  She was also the hostess that greeted me, and walked me over to my table...that's way too much ground to cover for this larger than usual location. COOL FEATURES --- Nice outdoor patio area with 15 tables, and heat lamps. LESS THAN COOL PARKING --- A little difficult to park anywhere close to the front door -- you should be prepared to walk a bit or have luck on your side.  If you prefer to valet park, no problem, that's the feature here of this mall, which gets strong consideration at peak times. CONCLUSION --- It was just 'alright'.  With all the other choices out there, I don't think I will be running back here anytime soon.  Well, I lied...I will visit for the Root Beer Float.  Can this kind of float be a valid entry into the Rose Bowl Parade?  Can I be entered if I eat/drink too many of them?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=220,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.668,3.0800000000000005

However, the service was slow, less than mediocre and the food was disgusting (I had the Baja shrimp tacos).  The only thing that was tasty and worthwhile was the Bottomless Strawberry Lemonade -- it was sooo delicious but I had to keep asking for refills which was pretty annoying.

273,Nicole J.,"Gardena, CA",72,118,562.0,3.0,2012-05-05,"I've been coming to the South Bay Galleria since I was a pre-teen (oh gosh that was so long ago..waaa) and would always see Red Robin, but never went in. My co-worker Denise asked me to lunch and was surprised when I told her that I had never been before. Located next door to Nordstroms, we were greeted by two friendly employees. We got there pretty early so it wasn't crowded and we had choice of where we sat. Red Robin is known for the different types of burgers they offer. Having gone to various burger places (The Counter, Fat Burger and Ruby's to name a few), I would've expected their selection of burgers would have been a bit bigger. If you look at the menu there are a lot of burgers listed, however many of them have similar ingredients so there wasn't that much of a distinction among some of them. Not a deal breaker, but an observation to note.  I ordered a raspberry limeade drink mixed with sprite. It was really good, I may have to make a home version of it because it was really tasty. The other good thing about this drink is that it fell into the ""refillable"" category which was a plus. Most restaurants that have specialty drinks will let you have refills without having to pay. The only drinks deemed refillable are the sodas, teas and lemonades so this was a pleasant surprise.  For food I got a patty melt. I must say it is really hard to find good patty melts these days. It just didn't have that ""patty melt"" taste for me. The bottomless fries were pretty good, however ours seemed like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp rather than being freshly cooked. And since we were one of the first in the restaurant, you wouldn't think that we'd have warm fries, but rather hot out the fryer.  Red Robin has a full bar area and also have televisions throughout the bar area so I would think it would be a nice place to catch a game or come in for happy hour.  The ambiance was pretty nice and our server was really attentive, however it wasn't a memorable enough place for me to want to return. I'll stick to Ruby's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=220,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8280000000000003,3.0400000000000005

I ordered a Buzallo Style Tavern Double, my friends ordered Cantina Jack Style Tavern Double and Burnin' Love.  Being the kind of girl who loves juicy burgers with some pink so I asked for it  to be medium; in fact we all ordered medium. Well, mine came out well-done!! They brought another one and it was a little better but not juicy or pink. The tavern doubles had really thin meat patties and the Burnin' Love was okay--it came out really pink--medium rare! The flavors weren't so bad but the patties felt like it came from a fast food joint. On top of that the service was only subpar. We had to wave several times to get her attention.

258,Neal N.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,108,1.0,1.0,2012-08-29,"I regret choosing Red Robin over Island Burgers to eat dinner at.  It should have been a tall tail sign that we made the wrong choice when the restaurant is pretty empty at 7:45 PM.   Upon entering, we saw several tables that were littered with the previous diner's cups, utensils, and baskets (food is served in a basket).  After we were seated a waitress was prompt in taking our food and beverage order, but extremely slow in bring out our drinks.  In fact, our drinks came out at the same time our food did.   To further emphasize our wrong decision on where to eat at, the person that served our food said, ""it's really slow here tonight.""  Well, if it's that slow, then why didn't you take the initiative to clean the dirty tables rather than stand around the bar area and watch television?   Eventually our waitress came back around and asked if we wanted refills on our beverages and more fries.  I wonder what gave her the impression we would like a refill, us sipping on a straw to obtain the last bit of melted ice from the bottom of our cups?  Plus, how are you supposed to enjoy a burger without fries?  On the plus side, the burger was cooked well and had a lot of flavor. After what seemed to be an eternity of starring at dirty tables and staff standing around the bar area, which was actually 15 minutes, we still haven't received our refills.  At that point, we wanted neither and just wanted to get out of there.  I was impossible to get the attention of anybody, so we had to go to the front counter to ask for our check. I guess it was evident we weren't satisfied with our service, so the hostess retrieved the manager to ask about our experience.  We explained to her our complaints and issues regarding the service and she apologized.  It wasn't until she actually looked around the restaurant for herself and realized we weren't exaggerating how dirty the restaurant looked.   If you're contemplating on where to eat while you're at the South Bay Galleria, consider Island Burgers or California Pizza Kitchen.  You don't want to leave a restaurant with regret and remorse, but a satisfied pallet and tantalized taste buds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=300,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.5960000000000005,3.0400000000000005

I was able to get through two sodas without the food arriving.  At that point, we had already been sitting in the restaurant for more than 30 minutes.  I was starving.  Looking around, I realized that the handful of people seated before us also remained food-less.. this didn't bode well. When the food finally came, my burger was acceptable and what I expected from a Red Robin.  Getting the check was another 20 minute ordeal (even when my companion just shoved his card into the waitress' hand without taking the check to examine it).

We are definitely creatures of habit - always getting the same thing, but we really love those burgers. However, when we received our burgers and took a bite, we were actually pretty disappointed because they just didn't taste the same. My dad and sister's guacamole bacon burger had a tiny blob of guacamole on it. There was such a small amount of it on there, my dad actually thought they forgot to put guacamole on it in the first place. My mom's and my sauteed 'shroom burger was extremely under seasoned. The mushrooms are usually really buttery and flavorful and this time they just tasted watery - no flavor at all! I had to ask for some horseradish to spread on the burger to get some flavor in there - but it wasn't really what I wanted. The only thing that saved the evening was our waitress. She was really great. She didn't even need to write down our orders, she just memorized them and didn't get a thing wrong.

217,Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,774,55.0,3.0,2013-10-31,"Birthday month 2013! Free red robin burger (ANY KIND!) during the month of your birthday for joining their Red Robin Loyalty club!  Red Robin isn't the joint I usually go to for my burger fix and I bet it has been tough to compete with the rise of gourmet burgers in the restaurant scene. Their free birthday burger promo definitely lured me in to give Red Robin a try. RR isn't horribly expensive (avg $10 a burger with side) but their burgers are pretty regular and definitely smaller than expected (I could finish an entire burger on my own). The best part is their bottomless side!! You can get either fries, BROCCOLI or a side salad. They do give a small portion of the side (probably so one doesn't waste) but you can keep ordering them.  Service was pretty average...probably because we sat at the bar area. We felt bad asking for more refill of our bottomless side. Looks like this place is one of those I'll frequent once a year ;)  Parking: Easy (located in the South Bay Galleria)  Additional loyalty club perk: free 10th item (they also offer entrees, salads, etc...) A note about the loyalty club: You can sign up online but they will verify your identity with A PHONE CALL (which I find the most annoying part).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=180,3.2,3.13,3.13,2.9240000000000004,3.158

When we were first seated a woman by the name of Theresa was our waitress. She was super friendly and I appreciated her positive attitude. Unfortunately I didn't appreciate the service. I'm not saying it's all her because she's a sweet woman and helped me out when I asked her to fix the bill for having lemon or some kind of foreign substance on my cup. I think I'm just more mad at the person who trained her. How could they not teach her to look at a glass before giving it to someone? And I'm also mad at whoever trained her because they didn't train her to wait at least 5 mins after getting my food to ask me how things are doing.  I don't know if I hadn't had a chance to take a bite yet. And thirdly, I felt that after she asked how the food was she felt that the customer service was over because I never seen her until it was time for the check. I had another waitress get me a refill on fries and to fix my drink. Normally this place is pretty good even when it's busy but the service today definitely sucked!

This review is a little late since the incident happen a month ago, but anyway.  I am Gluten Free (GF) - not by choice, unless I choose to be sick.   This review only applies to the REDONDO BEACH LOCATION - I have never had an issue with the Lake Forest, CA or  Hillsboro, OR (the two I visit most often) or the other locations I have gone to in the past years. I was working on a small project in the South Bay and the producer said I could order food from a place of my choosing since the restaurant they ordered from was not GF Friendly.  I choose Red Robin, I have been to several Red Robins in different cities and states and was always happy with the service I received - especially the fries. So I ordered a basic GF Bun (as listed on the menu) with a standard hamburger.  The hostess taking the order with GF Bun and GF Fries saying there was no issue with fulfillment.  Of course they had a contact number if anything needed to be questioned or revised.    So the very kind, and extremely busy, Producer's Assistant goes to the RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGERS in REDONDO BEACH and finds out there are no Gluten Free buns as originally promised and they do not have any Gluten Free fries.  -  So they could not fulfill the requested order. I completely understand that they run out, but that is the whole point of giving your phone number so they can contact you to let you know of changes - not when you show up and 20-30 minutes when the order is suppose to be ready.   Well the Order was not ready and they were waiting for the customer to revise.  If I had been informed sooner,  I might have changed my order to something easier.  Just like when you order dining in, the waiter or waitress comes by and lets you know within minutes of the order being placed if there is a problem. The Assistant made the best call - since they did not know what items they had in stock she got me a lettuce wrap and a side salad, which granted was healthier but not as enjoyable.  As most GF people know salad tend to be the safest order at most restaurants... but I am kinda sick of Salad as the only option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=240,3.28,3.13,3.13,2.5320000000000005,3.19

During today's visit, I grabbed Red Robin's blue cheese burger. A blue cheese burger is one of my favorite burgers and has been for a long time. But Red Robin's has to be the best blue cheese burger around. Not only did they add shoe string onions and an onion bun, but they threw on some mystery sauces that really caught me off guard. Coupled with their famous fries and table-top seasoning, it truly was a marvelous burger.  I specifically remember that towards the end of my meal, I thought to myself, ""THAT is one tasty burger!""  Al l in all, I love Red Robin. I sometimes forget about it but that's going to change hear in the near future. PS- get the strawberry lemonade!

170,Scott S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",708,558,1896.0,3.0,2014-07-15,"I believe the biggest problem with this location of Red Robin is their seating layout. It was not well thought out. All you have to do is go inside and you will quickly understand what I am saying. There are very few tables with any level of privacy or personal space, most on stacked right next to one another. I realize this is to maximize business. But, it is truly a poor business model as I know many people, including myself, who are very reluctant to go here due to this fact.   Then, there are the outdoor tables; where I prefer to sit. These tables are much more separated. The problem is, there is an exterior bench, right on the wall of this restaurant, where people sit and smoke. People also stand right next to the wall and smoke. This can really ruin your lunch or dinner.  The food is Red Robin. The servers are good or bad depending on who you get.  And, oh yeah, don't believe the commercial about a free burger on your birthday. The commercial doesn't tell you that you have to be signed up with their program to get one. I've had a few friends go here on their birthday expecting to get their eats on for free.

52,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,5.0,2014-07-19,"Reeeeed Robin ... yummmmmm. When I was in Hawaii, I would always see the Red Robin commercials on TV and want to go there even more, simply because there are no Red Robins in Hawaii.   But ever since I moved to California, I think I've been to Red Robin enough times to figure out my tried-and-true favorites. Even if I'm not a diehard burger fan, there's plenty on the Red Robin menu to choose from. One of my favorite entrees I ever got from Red Robin was discontinued--a full-sized entrée of creamy Mac & Cheese--but there are still a lot of menu offerings that I do like.   Of course, there will usually some sort of featured burger/promotion when you go to Red Robin, based on the time of year you are visiting or the different current events (sports events, etc.). But here are some of my favorites from the Red Robin menu:   ""Crispy Chicken Tender Salad"": This is my usual order whenever I go to Red Robin. This salad features a classic lettuce mix tossed with hard-boiled eggs, hardwood-smoked bacon, tomatoes and Cheddar, as well as chunks of Red Robin's classic ""Crispy Chicken Tenders."" The chicken tenders totally make this salad. There's a good amount of chicken that comes with the salad, and the dish is served with two pieces of garlic focaccia bread (especially amazing when they're warm) and your choice of dressing. While the honey mustard dressing is especially popular, I usually go for the blue cheese. This is probably one of my favorite salad entrees at a restaurant.    ""Smoke & Pepper"": This gourmet burger is one of the more recent additions to the Red Robin menu and is part of the eatery's recently launched ""Finest Gourmet Burgers"" line. This creation features a hamburger patty topped with black pepper bacon and extra sharp Cheddar cheese in between slices of a toasted ciabatta bun. The sandwich is served with the eatery's house-made Smoke & Pepper ketchup (which I opted to have on the side). I tried this burger when it first debuted and I was not disappointed with the creation. Basically, with this line of ""Finest"" burgers, Red Robin is upping the ante and creating more ""gourmet"" sandwiches. I loved the smoky, peppery flavor of this entrée, and it wasn't too spicy for me to handle. It tasted just fine without the ketchup, and a side of steak fries accompanied the burger, in true Red Robin fashion.   ""Bruschetta Chicken"": I've only tried this ""Bruschetta Chicken"" sandwich once, but I absolutely loved the pesto aioli. This dish is complete with grilled chicken breast topped with fresh bruschetta salsa, pesto aioli, Provolone, romaine lettuce and balsamic cream on rustic ciabatta bread. I ordered my sandwich with the salsa on the side, but the other flavors blended together perfectly. The chicken was tender, and the pesto-cheese blend was amazing, with the crunchy ciabatta to top it off.   ""Arctic Cod Fish & Chips"": I'm always on the hunt for a good fish 'n chips, and Red Robin's version doesn't disappoint. The eatery's version of this dish features premium hand-battered cod fillets that are fried to crispy perfection and served with bottomless steak fries. It's served with dill'd & pickle'd tartar sauce, and you can also use malt vinegar for additional flavor. If I don't feel like eating my usual salad or one of the chicken sandwiches, this entrée is my go-to.   ""Mac N' Cheese"": Though this is no longer an entrée (much to my dismay), you can still get the ""Mac N' Cheese"" as a side, and it also accompanies the ""Riblets & Mac N' Cheese"" entrée. I love this version of mac 'n cheese because it's classic yet incredibly creamy, featuring a cheesy blend of soft noodles.   ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"": I only had this dessert once, but boy, was it phenomenal. If you're an ice cream lover, then this is for you. The ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"" features piles of chocolate and vanilla ice cream layered with fudge, caramel and OREO cookies. I always get this dessert sans whipped cream because it has plenty of sweetness on its own. I love the combination of the OREO cookie crust, topped with the luscious ice cream and drizzled with the sticky caramel and fudge.   ""Gooey Chocolate Brownie Cake"": Though I can't say this ""Molten"" dessert is better than the one at Chili's, it's still a good sweet option to finish off your meal. This moist, indulgent chocolate brownie cake is topped with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge and is served with sweet strawberries and a berry sauce. The last time I had this brownie cake, there were a bit too many strawberries/too much berry sauce for my liking, as the sauce was a bit tart. But I love the texture of the fudgy brownie cake, and when combined with the vanilla ice cream and hot fudge, it's heaven on earth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80,3.28,3.17,3.17,2.676,3.214
50,Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",416,445,268.0,2.0,2014-08-02,"Red robin burgers are decent sized...  I have always asked to have them cut in half, so it would be easier to eat.  So, it was interesting when my waitress argued with me that they won't cut burgers in half anymore, then suggested she bring me a knife and I can cut it myself.  Why? Because it ruins the aesthetic value and won't look pretty anymore.  If this is truly Red robin policy, WTH corporate, seriously? If a customer wants a burger cut in half, cut the burger in half. So I ordered my usually veggie patty shroom burger with Swiss.  Know what happens? It comes out with a piece of corn on the edge of my plate (see photo).  So I get this lecture on how it's not pretty on my plate, but I get a stray piece of corn on my plate.. Got it. Also, our half order of onion rings came out burnt (see photo).  The onions inside were so withered and slimy from being overcooked.  I'm really disappointed  Red Robin.. You worry about pretty and now your food is coming out like this.  Seriously? Oh, and the hostess, despite checking on us.. I felt was having a bad day, so bad she had a poor attitude, didn't smile, couldn't even fake that she was an enthusiastic server.  Kind of had the ""oh well, get over it"" attitude when giving me the story on how they couldn't cut my burger, and the same attitude when asking how everything was (as if she cared).  Cheer up, buttercup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80,3.16,3.17,3.17,2.248,3.166

Took the server a long time to approach the table. 20+ mins. We were initially approached for drinks by the bus-boy. Indicative of good team work, at least. Server finally came. We were ready and ordered our app and meal at once. Appetizer came within an appropriate length of time. Food tho, well...that showed up about a half-hour after we finished our appetizer. And of course, it was cold. Considering we'd both ordered vegan patties....this was ridiculous. When the waitress returned, I voiced my frustration. She immediately offered to make me another but I was starved, I told her not to worry about it. I'd eat the one she served. The vegan patty was bland but no big deal, that's what you get when you order vegan at a burger joint. So there I sat, eating my cold, bland vegan burger - conjuring up a scathing review when she appeared. Stephanie (the waitress) had brought me a freshly made burger. ""Even though you said not to, I had them make you a fresh one anyway"" she said. ""I've also taken care of both your burgers"". ""I'm sorry for delay in your meals [she inserted an excuse about a computer failure here], I hope you'll at least take this one home with you"". It was as if she'd simultaneously given me warm hug and slapped the negative review right out of my head.  I was impressed. And grateful at the effort she'd made. It reminded me that outstanding customer service - even when so much has gone wrong - can always win someone back. Although I won't be back for the amazing vegan burger, I will be back, and RR can thank Stephanie for that. And it also speaks highly of a company where their employees have been trained to make customer satisfaction (within reason) a priority.

At one time they removed their spinach and artichoke dip from the menu - then when it returned, it was NOT the same. They also got rid of the ""Just In Quesadilla."" More recent visits have garnered dry burgers with scant toppings, enough bread in the bun to feed an army for a week, and ""blah"" french fries. Tonight - well, tonight was the end for me. Our server Liz was top notch. Every table in her section was filled but she made us feel like we were her top priority. She easily answered my questions about certain menu items, did not pressure us to order too quickly, and was generally attentive. Appetizer came, one of the three appetizer plates was very dirty, with visible dried food stuck on it. Ditto for one of the glasses of water. Ew. Easily rectified though. There were three of us in my party. My two companions ordered the clucks & fries, and the clucks & shrimp. Both of those meals were just ok - dry chicken and a lettuce leaf garnish that was so huge and wet it had to be removed immediately to prevent soggy french fries.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese as a side dish, and it was actually very good. I also ordered the boneless Whiskey River chicken wings, which are on a separate menu and I think are a limited time item. These are served with the onion strings and home made potato chips. The first piece I tried seemed to be mostly fat, so I did not think much of it and set it aside. The second piece was fairly large, so I attempted to cut it apart with my fork. I was about to give up and ask for a knife when I noticed WHY it would not cut - IT WAS RAW. Not just a little, and not just a small portion - RAW ALL THE WAY THROUGH, as in NOT COOKED and PINK. It just so happened that Liz and another lady who I presume was possibly the manager arrived at the same time to ask if everything was ok, and I passed my plate over and discreetly let them know what the problem was. They were both very kind and apologetic, and said they would speak with the kitchen staff. Several times they offered to re-do it or replace the item but I declined. I only requested they remove the boneless wings from my bill; the end result was a much larger discount and adjustment. For that, I have to say the customer service was excellent.  Unfortunately, the negative experience with dirty dishes and undercooked food will prevent me from returning for a very long time, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=240,2.84,3.13,3.13,2.34,3.014
336,Deles J.,"Vermont Vista, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,2014-12-29,"This is by far the only location where it takes 40-50 mins to receive an order of three ""burgers."" I've been here twice, and both times, the wait is ridiculously long and the waiters are incompetent. If this restaurant was cooking steaks or 5 star Italian with a crowded area, I'd understand. But, it's burgers and fries. It doesn't take almost an hour to deliver the most basic American dish. And on top of this, people who came in after us received their food 20 mins before ours. This occurred TWICE. The waiter, Mauricio, wrote my order wrong and then blamed me for the mistake. I told him, specifically, what I wanted while pointing to the item on the menu. He also forgot an onion soup that we explicitly ordered and never returned our refills. BUT he blamed me/us? This waiter is clearly forgetful and needs to work elsewhere.   I asked the manager, ""Why does it take so long?"" She attempted to explain using the current occupancy, which couldn't have caused 50 mins of waiting with so many empty seats available, and concluded that a chicken sandwich took longer to make. But, after I told the waiter to correct my order at the kitchen, it took less than 4 mins, not 40 mins. Then she spoke to us like we made the mistakes, yet our water, two lemonades, and onion soup still hadn't came. We requested those items 10 minutes beforehand.   This place is ridiculous.

147,Fiona H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",222,307,13.0,3.0,2015-01-05,"If you've been to one Red Robin, you've been to them all. Solid burgers, freckled lemonade and BOTTOMLESS FRIES! What more could a fat girl want?  For a burger chain, I like Red Robin. Prices are decent and food is consistently good. Also I mean who can say no to bottomless steak fries? Not me. Last time I came I had their Tavern Double Cheeseburger and...it was better than the one I had in Vegas at that super fancy place owned by a very big name celebrity chef. So, yeah.  The Royal Red Robin is also a good choice, used to be my go-to, if you're in the mood for a messy burger with an egg on top. This location though I must say is probably my least favorite just because I don't really care for the layout of this restaurant. The flow is very strange since the entrace is right in the middle of the whole place. Also, it's attached to the mall so it can get pretty packed which in turn, typically causes this one to have very slow service. I've only been to a few other ones but they always have better service and seem a lot more put together. That's kind of how chains are though, you never really know what you're going to get!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=160,2.72,3.09,3.09,2.54,2.9419999999999997
276,Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",456,184,91.0,1.0,2015-01-07,"I will never again go to a Red Robin restaurant again. 3 days ago, I had no opinion about Red Robin. I had been there probably twice before in my life. This review reflects my experience from 2 nights ago.  I've never in my life visited a restaurant with as poor customer service relations as this place. Neither managers appeared to care about customer satisfaction, even when they were clearly in the wrong. This goes for both the personnel and corporate relations.  So what is it that was so horrible. Let me start of first by saying that I would not have chosen to come here if it was not for the Free Birthday Burger voucher that was sent to me unsolicited by Red Robin. So, I grabbed my roommate and came down to have some drinks and a burger. When we first got there we were handed menus which were stuck together with the stickiest of syrup all over them. Do they not have the decency to at least clean off their menus? It was very disgusting. Little did I realize that the attitudes of the manager and servers would be equally disgusting. After ordering drinks, I handed the bartender my voucher and expected it to be honored as it was legitimate and was nothing fraudulent on my part. It even had my name on it. The bartender returned and said that they would need my club/membership card or something to that effect. I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. The Free Burger Voucher had nothing written on it at all regarding some club membership. In fact, written on the voucher, it said to just ""hand it to your server and enjoy a free burger! "" So I asked the bartender to bring over the manager. He was of no help and reiterated the same ""requirement"" that was not mentioned in the voucher. At this point, I'm feeling bamboozled.  I think this is called Bait and Switch. I asked them, why would I receive this voucher from your corporate PR/marketing department if they did not intend to honor it. I even showed the manager the email it came in on my phone to show that it was legitimate. I basically got the sorry your loss attitude as if I were some freeloader who can't afford to buy myself a burger. Now I know managers have the discretion to make customers happy, especially in situations of no fault by the customer. Not here. I was basically told they won't honor it, and my business is of no concern to them. They weren't interested in the business that would have been generated from the rounds of drinks we intended on consuming in celebration of my birthday, but also my roommate would have purchased a dinner. Instead, they preferred to leave me with a sour taste in my mouth, and stickiness all over my hands from their dirty menu. Instead, the manager preferred to leave me with the worst possible impression on their establishment that could be possible. Like I said, I went from having no opinion of Round Robin before going there, to now having the worst possible opinion of their establishment and their personnel. I will never again go to Red Robin, which means my friends and family that go out with me will never go there also.  For Red Robin Corporate/Marketing department, I would suggest that you not send out Birthday Vouchers that you don't intend on honoring. Lucky for us there was an Island's right around the corner that had an excellent late night happy hour. The food was great and the service there was excellent. Although we wasted half an hour at Red Robin just to get the Round Robin treatment, Island's came to the rescue for the night. We were happy to spend our $$ there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=220,2.56,3.05,3.05,2.2760000000000002,2.8539999999999996

Actually, the first time I ever went to this location was for my birthday. I took a rather large party, so I knew service would be a bit slower than usual; what I didn't expect was taking 20 minutes to take our order, half an hour for food, and upon receiving my food, still seeing cheese on the patty after I asked for none and let her know I was vegan. 20 more minutes later I get my burger, but not my sweet potato fries. 15 minutes later, I got my fries.

We expressed our feelings to him about the situation. Shortly right after our sever seemed to be very upset that we were speaking to her manger. She raised her voice ""IS EVERYTHING OK? CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?!! HOPE YOU FOLKS HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!!!"" Did not seem very sincere and looked bothered. We really weren't complaining to the manager.

They seemed to have redesigned the interior since my last visit about a year ago so it's bright, modern, and new looking.  The bar area's pretty nice and welcome, which is where I sat.  It seats about 6, I got there around 8pm and nobody was there.  There's also 4 tables behind, the rest of the dining area is built for tables of 4 or more + patio seating outside. They now have an ok happy hour with $3, $5, $7, $9 appetizers and alcohol around the $5 range (beer, wine, cocktails) which runs from around 6-closing I think.  The bartender told me that they were still running HH specials at least when I was there until closing.  I can see this being very popular after a night of shopping and hunger.  Looking at the new menu selections, they have some interesting burger combinations, some that looked like fancy creations out of steakhouses.  There was the Banzai (Hawaiian), the Bleu Ribbon, the Royal Red Ribbon (with an egg on top) to name a few plus about 10 others.  I ended up getting the Prime Chophouse with endless steakhouse french fries as the side, which you also get your choice of.  The burger was very meaty and juicy, plenty of mushrooms and the fried onions were great!

The service is TERRIBLE!       I walked in at around 7:45pm on a Monday night, there was no host and only about 6 tables in the whole place. I tried to get the attention of the many servers and what looked like a manager who walked by but they seemed to be too busy to simply acknowledge me. So I waited at the host stand and looked at a menu for 5 minutes before (who I believe to be the manager) came over to me. Before even asking how many were in my party or my name he told me to wait and he would get me when the next table became available. .. Ok. I realized they were probably all just flustered or something because there was another man waiting, visibly aggravated (apparently they had messed up his whole Togo order and he had been waiting for almost 30minutes)  My boyfriend showed up to meet me. We were greeted by a host finally who asked my name and preference for a table Or booth .. Booth .. She was polite told me it'd be 5 minutes. Then walked away. Again the manager came up to us, said to follow him, I could see he was walking us to a table and I was trying to explain to him Id like to wait for booth, he was very hard to communicate with, he cut me off and said ""oh ok. You want booth?"" Then just walked away leaving us in the middle of the restaurant.  Confused we walked back to the waiting area and sat down. Few minutes later a server came up to us and again asked how many and the name and walked us to a booth.  Finally we are seated, server said she'd be right with us and offered us water in the meantime. We both said yes she said she'd send someone over with them.  Waters never came.  It was now almost 8:36 and we had nothing infront of us but our menus finally she came back and asked if we were ready to order, I really wanted to try a mix drink. I picked two and asked her id she had tried either, she picked her favorite. He ordered a burger and coke, I ordered a vodka drink and half boneless wings. And now we wait.. And wait...

The host was a young man and told me it would be 10 minutes to seat me because it was busy. No Worries, it was busy.  In a few minutes I was seated at a table and my waitress was Natalie, she was so cool, she bought me some of those killer fries before my food came. Then there was Jeanette, I called her ""The Dancing Queen"", she complemented me and did a gig down the isle which caused me to laugh out loud and pull her over to me. I was like you really like your job  and she replied, ""I love people and I treat them as if they are at my home"". That did it for me, like wow how righteous is that, so very. Every time I looked up, she was having a good time causing me to have a good time. Natalie bought me my food, it was hot and fresh and had a smile for everyone she came into contact with. She checked up on me often and I didn't feel ignored in any way by them except for the black girl at the host podium, she passed by everyone and asked how were they and looked at me and turned her head. But I didn't trip because she wasn't important to me even though I should've gotten her name so I can put her on Blast right now (next time I won't be so polite about it), But I didn't let it take away from my experience there and still will give 5 stars, and I stuffed myself on those crazy good fries until I couldn't eat any more.

390,Matthew C.,"Austin, TX",4,8,,5.0,2015-05-31,"Red Robin is my favorite chain restaurant, narrowly beating out Outback Steakhouse. The burgers are huge, juicy and savory. The special seasoning at the tables is so amazing that I frequently remove the cap and just inhale deeply. The thick-cut steak fries are delicious and, of course, come with unlimited free refills. They even bring out orders of fries for the table before the meal comes, like Mexican restaurants do for chips. The root beer floats are sweet and fizzy and, like the fries, are bottomless. Word of advice: come here with an appetite. They never stop bringing you seconds and you need two or three refills of everything to really appreciate the experience. For dessert, I recommend the Towering Doh! Rings...miniature croissant/doughnuts all stacked on a giant wooden peg. Soft, sugary, and served fresh from the oven, it's pretty hard to stop eating them. A typical meal for two can run $30-40, a great value for the portions and quality. Everything I've said above could apply to the entire chain, but this location at the South Bay Galleria is great unto itself. There's nothing I enjoy more than coming here after watching a movie at the AMC on the other side of the mall. It's nice and clean, frequently crowded but never too loud. The waitstaff are friendly and helpful, and do everything they can to keep you eating, like the stereotypical grandmother always commenting that her grandchildren are skin and bones. To sum up: the chain has great food in great quantities at great prices, and this particular one has a great location with great service. Yummm.

I let her know I couldn't eat it, without even saying sorry, she took it to get me another one. 20 mins later, everyone is done eating and she said it's still going to be a few more minutes. Again no apologies.. finally my food gets there and it's almost burnt but it has the good bun so I just eat it. Not to mention after all this time, she wasnt even refilling our drinks. At this point I am actually expecting a discount because of how horrible it was. She could have even not charged me for my garlic aolli and I would have been satisfied. (Btw, charging for sauces when people are ordering a bunch of food anyway is ridiculous.. how much does that really cost you? ..for another time.)

I came here today for a quick lunch. I ordered an appetizer, which was good, and a garden burger with mac n cheese as my side. My burger came out with fries instead of the mac n cheese. I had to put my order in again for my correct side. Waited for a few minutes, no problem. When I got my mac n cheese, I noticed that something black was sticking out on the side of the dish underneath the cheese. I thought somehow a topping of some sort was accidentally mixed in, but when I inspected it, I noticed that it wasn't a topping. It looked like a fairly large piece of glass or sharp object. I alerted my waitress and she calmly took it to the back. After 10-15 minutes, the manager came to my table and said that it looked like an acrylic nail. She proceeded to tell me that she asked all of her staff about it, but no one's nails matched the one that was found in my food. She then told me that none of the cooks or servers are allowed to wear fake nails or long natural nails. So....where did it come from? They make the mac n cheese individually so I would think that whoever prepared the dish would be the person to blame. The nail was actually baked into the noodles and cheese. The manager was nice and seemed to show concern so I did not make a scene, but this is serious. First, it's absolutely DISGUSTING. Do you know what kind of germs are under nails? Second, what if I swallowed it?! They took the burger off of my tab (still paid for my apetitzer and drink) and apologized, but if I choked and died, an apology would do no good. Hopefully management gets down to the bottom of this because it's unacceptable.

When she came back she did not bring the utensils(burgers are easy but mac n cheese is a little tricky) and did not mention the missing drink.  She came back about 5 min later with forks and one napkin for each person, and we were told there were no clean knives(at this moment, I am thinking to my self, ""what the serious Fuck?""  How do you have a restaurant and not enough silverware for your guests?) and still no drink.  I took a bite of my burger, but then took the baby to let my wife eat.  Finished my cup of coffee.  I was asked in a pass by attempt if I wanted more coffee, which i definitely needed....  several minutes go by and I got up to walk around with the little fluffball.  I noticed that she wound up bringing a cup over.  When I made it back to the table, no creamer(wa wa waaaaaaaaa)  I was walking around still and asked our waitress if she could bring some creamer over...after a few more minutes of walking, I got to eat, the meal was the teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was very tasty, the SMALL cup of fries were tasty.  She walked by our table a few more times.  I was done with my food, my black coffee was still sitting there and about 10 minutes later she brought the creamer, and the check...(In my time walking around I saw a few people that were seated after us, and they got knives....)   I paid and I left...I honestly did not leave a big tip, $75 bill, and I left $10(I felt that was generous for poor service in my opinion) From what I heard, the food was good all around, but that bottomless fry idea did not exists at our table, not one was asked if they wanted more.  Once again, first time here, maybe I am supposed to ask, but if I didn't have to ask for more coffee, I figured I wouldn't have to ask for more fries... From there, we went outside to hang out for a bit and let the kids play and after about 20 minutes I looked in at where we were sitting, still a mess....

Used to frequent this place when I was younger, and came back for the first time in probably 3-4 years.  Initially the service was rather...leisurely. The waitress however was friendly and what have you, so it did somewhat make up for the non-expeditious nature of taking care of us. Ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger, and this is where it gets bad. I get my burger and it's about 30-40% smaller than I remember, but okay. Then I bite in. Now, it wasn't ""hockey puck"" status, but it was dry and burnt. I tasted only char, no onion straws and definitely no bbq sauce.  I ask the waitress to send it back. The replacement came in and looked 10x better and tasted decent, but it took a while to get the burger and by the time I got the 2nd burger the rest of my party had well finished their meal and I was loaded up on bottomless fries. And again, it just isn't the same as it used to be 4-5 years ago. Something changed and not for the better. Would I recommend this place to others? Doubtful Would I come back? For a quick burger, but not if I was looking for actual ""gourmet"" burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=120,2.52,2.77,3.08,2.34,2.67

Well he ordered what was supposed to be a gourmet hamburger-it was almost $15.It looked wonderful in the photo on the menu. It was so not gourmet! It was downright bad. It was skinny, not tasty, and totally disappointing. I ordered a sandwich - that was pretty good, but it came with soup. The soup - maybe 3 oz, came in a teeny tiny bowl  (if you could even call it that). It was supposed to be French onion soup. It looked absolutely disgusting. I sent it back and got tortilla soup. To make up for the gross onion soup, they brought out a full size bowl of tortilla soup. Even that didn't taste good- seems it must have been thickened with flour or corn starch.

You could tell she was working as hard as humanly possible.  One thing I love about red robin is all the refills and good attention.

110,Rick S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",543,1619,11938.0,3.0,2015-12-28,"The quality of the burgers were good, but not a whole lot better than some of the fast food burgers like Burger King, McDonald's but may be more on par with the cooked when ordered counter service places like In N Out, The Habit, Fatburger and 5 Guys. The average meal or entree is about $10 and if you get a drink, add in tax and tip and you're at around $20 per person.  If you go a bit deeper with appetizers and/or fancier desert drinks, you'll land around $25 per person. I think the prices could go down a notch.  It's less about the portions in terms of their bottomless french fries (or the healither fresh fruit option) and the burger itself, but the patties should be a bit thicker (I'm not sure if the patties are made by a pressing machine or previously frozen but they're reminiscent of Burger King, which isn't bad, but here there's a gourmet price tag 3x+ higher than their fast food peer), and also enable customers to have them cooked to order (i.e., medium rare as opposed to medium well, their default) to get a truly fresh tasting juicy hamburger, so maybe the quality can be taken up a notch.  I'd say the unique ingredients and different named burgers is nice, but the foundation of the hamburger, the beef patty needs maybe a little more TLC in their approach to the perfect burger. I've been going to Red Robin  once in a while since the 1990's, and did notice the re-branding of the restaurant as ""Gourmet Burgers"" and I know it's been 25+ years with inflation and overhead (employee minimum wage increases too), so can't expect them to be too low, but I think maybe making the burger a bit more remarkable for the price is the solution.   Or have some sort of pre-priced menu with a meal for 2 for $15 (Any 2 burgers w/ bottomless fries) total w/ a soft drink could be a good marketing strategy. I think I felt maybe I could get more or from my perspective better value (be it quality or quantity) for my money, or paid less elsewhere for the same.

The waitress started off attentive but got progressively worse the 1 1/2hrs we were there.  She would come by and check in with the surrounding tables and not even turn our way. I had to yell out ""excuse me!"" a handful of times just to have her refill our drinks. Also, RR now has these little tablets at every table that you can order food on, play games, pay your bill or call your server. Apparently these things do nothing as I pushed the button to CALL SERVER and all it does is blink. I have no idea if it's relaying to the front or if it's just supposed to get the waiters attention with the tiny blinking red light on it. Either way, it's pointless as it didn't have our waitress come over any quicker.  $86 bill she got a $6 tip and should consider herself lucky she got that. I don't really come to this location so probably won't be back for a good long while. Don't come here if you're on a time crunch, you'll be a while.  2 stars for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=180,2.92,2.68,2.956,2.568,2.7760000000000002

(More like just didn't take the time out to complain) Anywho...Went for the two tavern double burgers and appetizer promotional deal for 15 bucks. Had to speak with management to substitute one burger for turkey as I don't eat Beef which was a small hassle when Islands substitutes easily and for free. So she charged me 2 bucks extra for the substitution, yet when the burger finally arrived to our table there was only ONE patty, not two! (Sad face)  Feeling spiritual and on a ""date night"".... I didn't complain. The burger is NOT big and luscious like it looks like in the commercial either. NO two handed monster burger, not even close. The bun is a wee bit bigger than a McChicken's bun. It's a generally small burger but just enough food to be pleasantly full along with eating the bottomless fries. Also our fries were prepared fresh and arrived piping hot as I requested. ""Interesting"" Turkey Patty though... It's a pretty Odd, SUPER poultry flavored turkey patty overly moist and dripping with broth that tasted completely unnatural and manufactured. Like a giant McFrankin' nugget....I could only imagine the blended up turkey parts slapped together and molded into a patty.  I bet I won't catch a cold for years I'm so chicken juiced up, LoL!!

The food was excellent in quality and taste. IT WAS NOT HOT! That was the biggest disappointment. It wasn't cold either though.  The service was slow and not really attentive. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks and order. After it took another 20 minutes to get food... So took a total of 35 minutes to order and get the food to our table. Then it wasn't even fresh and hot?? I ordered boneless chicken wings that came with potato chips. So red robin is telling me it takes 20 mins to fry chicken wings and apply sauce and let it become cool before giving it to the customer? I was really disappointed in the service. I seen the manager doing more work then the actual waiter. Our waiter checked up on us once. Adding to the bad service it was a Thursday night at 9 PM. Our waiter only has 2 other tables. A total of 7 people to serve.  I did forget to mention the table next to us who was also served by the same waiter came in 10 minutes after us and got their food the same time.  They never told us why our food took to long. Or apologized.  The food was a 3 star. The service was a 0.

I also asked them to toss it, but they didn't do it either so I had to send it back. They added some avocado but the salad still wasn't tossed. My boyfriend got Royal Red Robin burger, which was actually very tasty but barely warm. The fries weren't hot either, and when we asked our waiter to replace them with the hot ones, he brought new fries of exactly the same temperature - almost cold. Our waiter was very nice and friendly but it doesn't help much - with workers screwing up your orders Red Robin leaves a negative impression.

171,Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,2016-04-18,"Hello, The reasoning for this review is too share my recent experience and the horrible customer service at your South bay Galleria location. On April 14th, 2015 myself and my co-work stopped by to grab lunch. After browsing the menu, we were ready to order. I ordered my norm, in which was the 'Royal Red Robin"" with no bun and asked that my egg be cooked medium well. Before I could even get my request out regarding how I'd like my egg cooked, the waitress stated I could only choose from a"" well-cooked or sunny side up egg"". Then thought that was odd because I am a repeating customer and not ONCE has a waiter or waitress stated I could only choose between the two. I then expressed my concerns to her and asked could my egg be made medium well? Waiting for a response, her whole demeanor changed as if she was irritated I asked. She then stated ""well, the cook can only cook the egg those two ways"" and stood there. Then I guess she thought better of it and said let me go asked just to make sure. After she walks off, I go to the restroom and I see our waitress in the counter speaking with another worker of Red Robin, African American girl. Shortly after, the same girl I saw our waitress speaking to came over and pretty much told me what I could and couldn't order very rudely. Not once did she introduce herself, I'm not sure if she was a manger or not; however, I feel like a proper introduction of who you are would have been more appropriated rather than speaking to me anything less than a customer. I would include her name but she did NOT have on a badge. At this point I was feed up and if were hadn't been for my co-worker with me, I would have left!  And afterwards, I'm assuming our waitress did not want to serve us because another waitress starting serving us. Please help me understand, if I'm paying for MY food to be cooked a certain way, ""why is it so hard to do so""??? All I wanted was for my egg to be cooked medium well like I ALWAYS get it!  I absolutely love Red Robin and I often visit the Lakewood location, I've never had a problem.. They treat their customers so nice. We were in the area and stopped by and this location was beyond me. I didn't like the feeling of feeling like we had to just deal with it. We are customers like everyone else!

Of the food that arrived, only a quarter of it was a-okay, my burger. Her guacamole burger arrived with very little guac. Our extra crispy fries were limp and we could tell we're not fresh (we both like 'em well done). Ray offered to get us more, 2nd round was about a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the crisp that we like. Again the fries were lukewarm at best. By this time we had finished our burgers. A 3rd round arrived, this time they were crispy, but again not piping hot but passable. Ray was attentive and did the best he could...it seems it was the kitchen that didn't do their part.  And unfortunately we did not enjoy our experience.  My Sam Adams was icy cold and water was plentiful.

""Are you looking for AMAZING burgers?"" This is not the place.

You can definitely find a better place that's not a nationwide chain restaurant.  ""Are you looking for ENDLESS fries?"" This is the place! Red Robins is known for their ""bottomless"" fries. Order your burger and ask to start off with some fries, order more if you have to (while you wait for your burger), then your burger will come out with fries, and then you're free to keep ordering more! Don't forget to ask for dipping sauces!

I chose to sit at the bar top because I thought service would be quicker. Not only was service below par, the bar area was not busy, and my bartender (Maria) seemed like she was overwhelmed or annoyed (or maybe both). As soon as I took a seat at the bar top she didn't say anything until she completed whatever she was doing. Then she asked me if I wanted drinks without handing me a drink menu or even a food menu. So at that point I had to ask her for a food menu, she handed it off to me but it was clear that she really didn't want to be bothered. I was looking at her screen and it wasn't full, and the other patrons at the bar top seemed content, so I don't know why she had that attitude. When I was finally ready to order, I had a request for the pacing of my food, I wanted my salad out first and the entree out after, she smirked and repeated my order. The food came out just like I wanted however, the chicken wings were so tiny and not even spicy. That was a disappointment, secondly she didn't ask me how I liked my food during the course of my time spent there. I'm giving one star because I can't give negative stars. Service at the bar top was poor and the food was subpar. What makes this horrible is the fact that it was my first time ever dining at Red Robin's and my experience was unpleasant, it wasn't a welcoming environment. I will definitely NOT be returning to Red Robin's. If you choose to eat at Red Robin's go at your own risk and set very low expectations, matter-of-fact don't have any expectations.  And if the bartender Maria, reads this (& I hope she does) you should really learn how to be sociable and personable if you're going to be bartending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=120,2.96,2.9,2.932,2.468,2.924

Presumptuous.  We need to sit in the lower seats.  They moved us.  Instead of the server coming by right away, it took the server 5 minutes to come by. She was nice but... We ordered our beverages another seven minutes. By the way no silverware.   Drinks come, still no silverware. (HUGE PET PEEVE).  We waited for about 20 min. I ordered an onion roll for my burger. Never got it.  The manager came by. We said everything is slow. We got fries, still no silverware.   Food comes  same time the fries came.   Waited 24 min plus for our check.  Waitress took an order before we got the check.  Slow night.  Terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=60,3.2,3.01,2.932,2.148,3.086

But the major problem was when it was time to pay and leave.  I mentioned having a loyalty card and she pulled up that screen on the device on the table that's used to pay the bill and then she left.  It wouldn't accept my phone number.  It wouldn't read the loyalty card when I swiped it.  So I hit the ""call server"" button hoping to get credit on the loyalty card.  After waiting 15 minutes with no one stopping at the table, I had to pay and leave.  I had to be somewhere.

Me and my friend came to this location because she wanted to take some santa pictures with her daughter. so sure why not right. we couldnt take the pictures until 7pm, and we got there at 530pm so we had to kill an hour, so we came here to eat because i been craving one of their burgers i keep seeing and my friend said it was the burgers were bomb here. so we got seated and had to run back to the truck to get a bottle of water for her daughter. so i left, i texted her to order me a plain iced tea when the server comes. i returned and no one served us yet. which isnt a big deal because i didn't park that far from them. NOW, heres the thing that i found questionable...the server comes and begins taking orders, but for the family of 7 right across from us! and mind you that me and my friend were there 15min before the family and they got served before we did. then he turned and took our orders, brushed it off like whatever since he finally took our orders. I wanted THE GHOST JALAPENO BURGER, which has 2 patties and obviously JALAPENOS. we let time slide by a bit until the drinks came. So the food came and i didnt notice it at first because me and my friend were just chit-chatting & laughing, so i look at the burger, and guess what...WRONG DAMN BURGER! it was just a PLAIN, BACON CHESSEBURGER with garlic fries(which he did get right) i had gone to the gym earlier before we left to the mall and i hadnt eaten since the morning and we were on a timed schedule, i ate the burger and it was unsatisfying to eat. Didnt want to send it back and wait longer to get the burger i wanted and miss the santa pictures for her. And strangely the manager came out of NOWHERE and gave us a FREE grilled cheese with fries, i looked over at my friend and we both had a confused look on our faces like wtf just happened?! BUT, apparently, strangely enough that the family of 7 got their ENTIRE order on point! there were no complaints, nothing missing, NOTHING!!! NEVER...EVER...AGAIN...will we return to this red robin.

Been coming here since day one and have witnessed this location's many transformations.  I once witnessed a server argue with the guests but this was years ago.  Anyway, when I arrived on Saturday the manager was there but she didn't stay.  So here we go... It wasn't terribly crowded but more servers wouldn't have hurt on a Saturday afternoon in December.  They seat me at the bar and I was tempted to use the machine but it doesn't list everything.  The young male server takes my order and while my weak cocktail took only 5 minutes, a side salad and fries took forever. After waiting more than 20 minutes, it was the wrong salad and I wasn't offered bottomless fries while I waited for a replacement.  The new salad was an entree but I ate it anyway.  A different female manager came around during my wait and I told her service was so-so and she replied ""That's nice"".  Maybe English isn't her first language. No one apologized for the mix-up nor was a refill offered.  The server presented the check and after 10 minutes, I used the self-pay.  That's when he came around TWICE to wish me a happy holiday.  Had he done that a half hour prior, he would've received a better tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=40,3.0,2.96,2.92,2.472,2.9760000000000004

Wow!!

The quality isn't as good as I remember, or maybe its just this location or... maybe I just chose the wrong burger but today's visit left me thinking that I shouldn't go to Red Robin anymore. My sister and I arrived at noon and were promptly seated by the host on their ""patio"" which is actually in the mall. Our server, Shannell was great. Super attentive, quick to ask us if we wanted fries and drink refills and was very friendly. Even though she got a bunch of tables back to back (and 2 large parties too), she still managed to give us great service.  I always get the freckled lemonade ($4.99), free refills! It wasn't very sour today and seemed a bit watered down IMO. My sister thought it was ok though.  - Bleu ribbon burger: tomatoes, lettuce, patty and blue cheese with a chipotle sauce I believe. I love blue cheese so I thought it would be a good choice but I was a bit disappointed when it came out. The buns weren't your traditional bun, and I think I was distracted by the blue cheese because I didn't notice that on the menu, it said onion bun! My burger was cold and the bun wasn't toasted. It wasn't very appetizing. I'm not sure if it was left to sit out while waiting for the fresh batch of fries to come out. My fries were also decent. I thought they could have stayed in the fryer for a tad bit longer.  - Fish and chips $13.49. 4 medium pieces of battered fish on top of a lettuce garnish and served with some tartar sauce and lemon. It came with bottomeless fries but my sister opted out for mac n cheese for $1.49 more. She really enjoyed the mac n cheese and thought the fish was just ok. Not the best she's had according to her.  Our server eventually got super busy, but I think a manager came by our table to ask us if we needed anything else. We requested a box. The cool thing is that you can pay at your table using the ipads they have on the table. Its similar to outback, applebees and other restaurants now a days.

27,Lissa M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",81,14,8.0,1.0,2017-04-16,Food actually was good I had the black and bleu burger and it was cooked to my liking. Although it didn't have a lot of seasoning there is the house seasoning on the table to indulge. Fries hot and fresh onion ring tower was good. Only complaint if you order the bottomless fries you should actually receive unlimited amounts we didn't. So I would actually give the food 4 stars for the quality. For me it's very pricey for burgers and fries $45 for two people is a bit much and this would be my only deterrent for not frequenting the joint.  Service really needs some help there should be someone at the wait desk when you walk in or else why have there? Server was a bit slow on the refill jump but I guess maybe because it was a Saturday night. Update... Recently revisited had the same thing and it did not tastes the same burger was flavorless cold fries. The service is horrible slow uninviting and for some reason the place just feels dirty and sticky.

We were in the patio area because we had our puppy with us; all together there were approximately six tables in use and four were near the end of their meals.  I am not sure if more coverage was needed for that area or if our server was simply overwhelmed.  I am a rewards card member and I do not know if I will be back any time soon; I am writing this review in hopes the wait time will be improved for other patrons.  Also, a manager did come and apologize for the appetizer problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=20,2.68,2.94,2.88,2.408,2.8360000000000003

HOWEVER, i'm giving them a 1 star because the customer service is just awful. I went in on a Friday night - a wait for two people at 8:00pm was 20-25 minutes. Not bad. Until it turned out to be a 40 minute wait, and we arrived hungry. Once we finally got seated, a woman in a flowery shirt (the manager i'm assuming) took our drink order and told us our server will be right with us. She got our waters promptly and left. That was the last time any of the staff assisted us for a good 20-30 minutes. We waited and waited and waited, we didn't even know who our server was-- and guests who were seated AFTER us were already getting their food orders taken. I had to get up and let the manager know (who wasn't even paying attention to the floor, she was just mingling with the staff) that our server hasn't come in the past 30 minutes to take our orders. She then apologizes, and takes our order. She brings out a basket of fries with different sauces as an apology (which would've been nice, if we already didn't get bottomless fries with our burger). Finally our waitress, Shania, finally introduces herself, although she had passed our table a plenty amount of times while we were waiting to get our orders taken. I understand, she had a large party next to us, but if you can't handle that many people in your section maybe don't be a waiter??? It wasn't until AFTER the party left when she introduced herself.  The food was brought to the table and it was delicious we got the banzai burger and the sriracha tavern double, both came with bottomless steak fries. So with the fries from the manager, our actual meal with fries, Shania finally ""tries"" to be our waitress and brings us another basket of fries, ones that we don't want. We're already full, and irritated that the gesture just didn't seem enough anymore to redeem what little ""good"" customer service they had left. We didn't touch the basket, asked for the check and left. All in all, the food is pretty good here. However, if you come to this location, I recommend just getting take-out from here. We got there around 8, didn't finish until almost 10:30 because we waited so long.

But apparently he was on the way out. Got a replacement lady. Super helpful and very caring.  Got two burgers and kids chicken tenders.  Fire Burger thing was good. I got it with chicken and it had the Chipotle flavor. Not spicy at all.  so don't be afraid of it. Was good. Not memorable to say. But satisfies the hunger.  Salmon Burger was GREAT. Deff something I'd get again if I ever came back. Not dry Salmon. Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Makes you feel like you don't want it to end.  Endless fries are nice. Not a big fan of them but the kids liked them. Chicken tenders were dry. Kids had a hard time chewing them. So that didnt get finished.  Besides that we were offered more fries.  But we can't because we were so full.   Never ending Rootbeer Float is a must if you like it. I do! Hard time transfering root beer into the ice cream mug.

From the photo, the Tavern burger looks pretty good and I was informed how great a burger it is.  For me, all I'm able to have as far as burgers go, is the veggie burger.  I can get any version burger with a veggie patty.  I usually go with something like bbq or something  with a flavorful sauce otherwise regular condiments on a veggie patty is quite bland as their veggie patties are just OK.

3,Jenn J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",178,188,1560.0,3.0,2017-12-03,"We come to this Red Robin quite often. It is conveniently located in the South Bay Galleria mall. We like the burgers and bottomless sides. It's reliably better than Johnny Rockets by a long moon shot.  Hubby and I enjoy the Red Robin Tavern, the guacamole and bacon burger and the Pesto Chicken burger. We also like to personalize our burgers with ciabatta bread and fresh jalapeños.  The kids meals are great deals! My toddlers love these meals. About $4.50-$6.00 for an entree (cod fritter, chicken tender, grilled chicken breast, meatballs, pizza, mac n cheese...), a bottomless side (fries, broccoli, corn, apples, fruit medley...) and a drink (milk, chocolate milk, lemonade, fountain drink). Serving size seems good enough for a 9-10 year old, as long as they get a refill or two on the bottomless size. A 12 year old may still be hungry with these portion sizes.  Given how much we love this place, why not a 5-star review? Service is spotty. Bottomless sides are not refilled all that frequently- seems the restaurant is chronically understaffed with just one waitress for a dozen tables. Also, some of the patrons are on the Ghetto size - I get that this is just the demographics of this mall but it sometimes makes eating here uncomfortable.  The Red Robin Rewards program provides coupons and frequent diners free burgers (10th burger free). Plus, a free burger on your birthday.

I have returned twice and have been disappointed both times. The service was mediocre. My friend and I sat at the bar area and we received no service. After 15 minutes of just sitting I was ready to walk out, but my friend waved another waiter down who then told us someone would be right with us. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and a young lady came over and took our orders. We ordered the chili cheese fries (after I warned my friend they aren't good) as well as fries, and fried pickles. We enjoyed everything except the chili cheese fries. We tasted almost no chili. Red Robin should call them cheese fries b/c that's all we tasted. Against my better judgement I came back and ordered the Banzi burger. It was absolutely awful. The pineapple tasted and looked old. There was just a pinch of teriyaki sauce on the burger. I ordered the burger thinking it would taste like the Maui burger at Islands, I was wrong. Oh and service again was reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally slow.

Oh, and their Crispy Chicken Sandwich is almost as good as another famous Chicken Sandwich spot I know of.  The staff is so friendly. They were quick to bring out the food and drinks but wasn't on their game about providing utensils and napkins before hand. Had to wait a few bites until I realized I was missing those items. But once I asked them for it, they immediately brought it over in milliseconds. I think the self pay kiosk at the tables is a very clever way to eliminate any billing issues.

Sure, it's good, but it's not amazing. Wife and I always get the tavern burgers as that's the best bang for buck. Reason I gave a 3 rather than 4 or 5 is because it's always a crap shoot when it comes service at this particular RR. We've had some servers seemingly disappear on us for a whole meal service, servers showing partiality in service to other tables based off appearances, and servers that nickle and dime us with charges for items that weren't previously noted that we'd be charged for - so watch out for those random misc charges when you get your check.
