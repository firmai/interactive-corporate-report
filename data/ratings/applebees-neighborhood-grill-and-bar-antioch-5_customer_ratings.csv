There are way too many other places to go to enjoy a good time.  The first time we had a bad experience it was our waiters first day on his own, mind you this was a busy Saturday night. Not so wise. It took him 20min to come wait on us. We never got a refill on our drinks. The second time my husbands meal was not at all what he ordered. We were nice about it and the waitress had the ovaries to ask ""so you don't wan it??"" Uggh no you cow, it's not what we ordered. The last and final time I will step foot in an Applebees was last week. My husband and me decided to go out for happy hour, we had a babysitter and the evening to ourselves. HUGE, HUGE let down. I ordered a Margarita and my mouth was watering just thinking about it. I get it and think perhaps thought the waitress thought I was under 21 and brought me a virgin. I told her I would pay full price for a decent margarita. She said that's how they make them. I immediately canceled the rest of our order and we left and headed to Chilis. I had to confess to our waiter that we had an temporary lapse of good judgement and strayed but we were back for good.  I will not be surprised if I drove by this place and it was shut down.

The food quality sucked. The cook said that we should try the Chipotle Cream Steak & Shrimp that it was his favorite. My boyfriend did and the steak lacked all flavor and shrimp were overcooked and for $13.99 the amount of food you get is a joke. It had a 7 oz steak including 5 baby shrimp and about 6 small cubes of potatoes. We did not receive any napkins for dinner. It seemed a little busy but not to spend an hour and half to eat and go. I had a bacon cheeseburger nothing special, and also the queso blanco which was alright. I have to say I would have rather spent $35 at Jack In The Box!

He would literally shout across a crowded room to servers about pending seating arrangements.  Just gave the overall feeling of being at a Denny's or something. Waited for a server to take our order longer that we waited to be seated.  We waited over 45 minutes for our food to arrive -according to the over apologetic server, the kitchen was soooooo busy ( shouldn't one expect a busy kitchen at dinner hour? In a restaurant? And perhaps prepare in advance for it) After enduring the wait, THE FOOD WAS COLD!!!! Obviously our food sat in the ""busy kitchen"" for some time before being brought out :( Itwas more than apparent that there was a shortage of skilled servers in the building, it seemed more like training camp for potential servers as there was much unorganized running going on with no productive table waiting happening.  The level of service has continued to TANK at this particular location for about the last six months.  We used to frequent weekly, then new management or something came in, we tried to ride out the quirks but stopped going all together after about five attempts for a nice meal.  This was the first time we had been in in about three months.  We were hopeful things would be smoother and more enjoyable by now however, it was just the opposite.  We will not be going back.

There were even some young kids (about 8 to 10 years old or so) singing to the song with the words Bubble Butt and those were the tame lyrics. I was very surprised by the foul language from the loud music and all of the families that had kids with them.  It really blew me away.  Maybe I am getting too old, but I thought a restaurant should do something unique such as serve good food with peace and quiet. My daughter's cajun pasta with shrimp was horrible.  No sauce, no spice, and very bland.  She even found veins in the shrimp.  We shared our meals with her so she could get something decent to eat.  We should have sent it back. My wife ordered a medium rare steak, but got a steak barely cooked.  It looked almost blue.  She sent it back and got it cooked the way she asked. On the plus side, my steak was exactly as I ordered it and good.  My other daughter had the chicken ceasar salad and that was good as well.

So I looked on line and what great pictures they have and selected a spinach salad, with blue cheese chunks, roasted pecans, roasted chicken ( I am a vegetarian so asked it to be on side to give to girls, strawberries and blueberries. Now if you look at the picture you will see a beautiful salad. When he dropped it off I could not believe what I saw, so I took a picture and it is now my main photo on my profile. I don't even think their was one strawberry and the few blueberries half were rotten. Needless to say I did not eat dinner at all. It looked like the spinach hadn't even been washed. I called the manager and told him what happened he said come back and we will make you another one. I told him I don't drive at night so he said he will send me a coupon for a new salad that I should receive within 3-4 weeks. The coat of this box of spinach was 10.99! I am on a limited budget and that took part of my food allowance for the week. He could of offered to have someone bring the salad to me.. I would of preferred a credit so I could have money for food this week. So look at my picture and then go to their website and tell me if you think I got ripped off.

I felt like I didn't have to ssuuuush my kids because they were being too loud. The 24ct boneless buffalo were eaten as a meal instead of appetizers. Demolished by my 15yo! I had only one (as he gave me the evil eye if I ate any more), the sauce was hot and chicken was moist and fresh. Hubby had the Bacon Cheeseburger. Demolished! The patty was a bit thin for his liking but he stated he was full after wards. I ordered the Roast Beef bacon & mushroom and Swiss Sammy. I devoured it! The roast beef was thinly sliced and plentiful. The mushrooms were sauteed and placed over the thick slices of perfectly cooked bacon. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted and didn't get all soggy. Or maybe it didn't get soggy because I didn't put it down long enough!?! I would order it again. The birthday boy ordered the Kids Mac n' Cheese. A very simple plate of just that. No sides came with it. When we ordered milk with it, it comes in a sealed milk bottle. I like that it came like that. All in all, we all enjoyed our food, drinks and our server.  Bathrooms were clean and smelled free of ""stank"" LOL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=80,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.652,1.8000000000000003

Down south we frequented out neighborhood Applebee's every other week. One night, after a trip to the emergency room with our 4 year old daughter, we stopped here at her request. Let me just say, the difference between our old Applebee's and this one is day and night. We got seated quickly, but that was the only good thing about this visit. Took forever for our server to get our drink order and even longer for him to come back and take our food order. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks, because my daughter was starving. Drinks came out about 15 minutes later with no appetizer. After we finally ordered our food it took, and I am not exaggerating, 45 minutes for it to come out. Still no appetizer mind you, and the entrees that did come out were cold. I said something to our server when he took so long to come back to take our order. He came up with some BS story about being short staffed and three people walking out on top of that. When the food came out cold, I couldn't take it anymore. We spoke with the manager, who came up to the table, grabbed a chair and sat there staring at us. He just looked at is for a good 40 seconds, before i finally started talking. He tried using an excuse of them being super busy and one person had called out. He asked if they could remake our orders, but we declined because it was late, my daughter was hungry, and I told him we didn't feel like waiting another hour before fresh food came out. He didn't really seem to care and didn't offer any other solution to the problem. Well, he did remover the appetizer from the bill. But WE NEVER GOT THE APPETIZER!

And if you look at my record of reviews and see the massive list of five stars I've thrown around, you know I REALLY hate to say this. But I can totally see why this place only has two stars. We went for my step sister's birthday, and I know she and her friends are rude and not very patient, but I was running out steam trying to protect the server, whom I knew personally from high school. Maybe they were just having a bad night, I want to say, ignoring the glaring two star total the business is sporting. But seriously, we were only supposed to be there for an hour and a half. Instead, we WAITED FOR FOOD for over an hour. Finally the food came out and the birthday girl's mother had her order wrong (although she didn't have him correct it, but maybe she was afraid to wait another hour). That bitch is no peach, so on a $70 bill she left our server $2. Which was so deplorable. I wish I had known before we left. Our server was a great dude and he didn't really do anything wrong. He was very present and on top of things with the drinks, and the place wasn't all that busy so he was constantly moving between the kitchen and his three tables. The lady behind us yelled at him and demanded to see the manager, and my mother and I started talking a little shit about ""people who are bad to service people"" and then that bitch apologized to him when he came back around with the manager. Seriously, I have to say again, it WAS NOT his fault. The kitchen was probably understaffed (or on strike back there, wtf) and there wasn't anything he could do about it. I could tell he was under pressure too, because he tried to save himself by making the birthday girl's dessert HIMSELF. You know there's an issue in the kitchen if the server is suddenly making your food. My mom and I tipped extra, because unlike everybody else at the table we have a shred of sympathy because we actually had to work at our service jobs and put up with bad customers. If I had known my stepmom was going to be such a shady bitch, I would have tipped him even more. I only gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because he tried hard enough that the least he deserves is a star on damn review site.

Working and running a restaurant business before, we understand that sometimes mistakes happen and service can be backed up due to how busy the restaurant is. But this time was just beyond HORRIBLE! This month, we've came about 2 times hoping that the service would be better, but it got worse and worse each time. The second time was the absolute WORST service we've ever received anywhere! Experience #1: We came in and waited a while to get seated, but it wasn't a big deal because we figured that the host might be busy with Togos (totally understandable, no biggy). When we were seated there were only two other tables, it was not busy at all. It took our waiter about 10 minutes to finally acknowledge us, but he nice so we let it go. We ordered our food and I ordered a Midori Sour (blended). The drink was made on the rocks, so I kindly told him that I had ordered it blended. Instead of re-making it, the bartender just added more ice and blended it and it tasted so diluted and watered down. It literally tasted like shaved ice with a hint of lemon. I didn't want to make our server take it back again, so we accepted it and moved on (Maybe next time, right?). Our food comes out and the pasta was super dry so I asked for more Alfredo sauce on the side. It took 20 minutes for them to bring out the sauce, at that point my boyfriend had already finished his meal so we just packed mine togo. This wasn't such a great experience, but seeing that the waiter was nice and probably trying his best left it alone and hoped for a better experience next time. WRONG! Experience #2: We came in and got seated right away. The restaurant felt so empty. There was two customers at the bar and about 3 other tables besides our table in the entire place. The waitress was VERY RUDE. The food was came out so slow and she got one of our order wrong. We didn't mind that it was wrong, but she was very rude about it.  When the rest of our food came out the Rib-let basket looked like leftovers from another table (see picture). The dish was messy and there was very little fries. The waitress noticed this too and said she would be back with more fries (never did). We asked for more water for everyone and before we could finish our sentence she was already walking away from our table and turned around with a quick ""UH-HUH, yeah"". Overall, the waitress' tone, attitude, and service was horrible. To us, it felt like she didn't even want to be there.  Our friends and families have told us that the service and environment has changed drastically and we should've listened to them. We will NOT be coming back to this location. I hope the management does something fast because the place is getting worse and worse. It used to be so packed and lively and now it's completely washed out.

Ever since other restaurants have came to the area and are closer to our house we haven't been back to Applebee's in many years. Not that we ever had a bad experience it was just new places. However after having quite a few very bad food services (mold) at ch****, we thought why not. Our visit was a few days ago and on a sat at about 9pm. Pretty quiet considering a sat and our waiter Justin felt a little green but did seem to try and no complaints. Hubby and one teen both got hamburgers. A little weird that lettuce, tomato etc was ""upon request"" but Justin brought them out right away. They absolutely LOVED them. I got the salmon... It was good. Cooked perfect, I was a little disappointed on the creamy dill sauce that wasn't creamy. I removed it and ate just the salmon. Might have considered it great if it had the sauce I expected. Last...other kid ordered salsa verde nachos...wow, very yummy.

Pretty sweet deal. We got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was very filling, but lacked a fresh artichoke flavor. Regardless, we damn near cleared our the ramekin. He ordered the chicken bourbon with shrimp and I ordered the lemon glazed grilled chicken. His order came with fried russet potatoes on the side. His only comment was that the chicken was way overcooked, but that it had a great flavor. I enjoyed the lemon glaze on mine and found the grilled chicken to be perfectly cooked and moist. My dish also came with a side of rice pilaf/quinoa and small (very small) chunks of apple, cranberries and celery for texture.

I mean really! why would I come all the way to Antioch! to play games! with someone time! to lie about my age? some would say it's a compliment.. but I took it as disrespect and humiliation for me and my guy...I would never go back to this Applebee's ever again!... They treated us so poorly and like we were criminals and Liars!.. And all we were trying to do is sit down and have lunch, and have a drink on the side.. wow!..

This place though has been the best out of them all. As soon as we entered we were greeted right away and seated. Our waitress CHEYENNE was amazing!! Super friendly and was always checking in with us. Great personality as well! Food was great as well. Honestly the best I have ever had at any Applebee's and the cook in the back came out a fees seconds behind one of the other staff when he realized that they brought the wrong wings to us. We changed our flavor last minute but they were right on top of it.

88,Joyce K.,"Contra Costa County, CA",1,42,4.0,1.0,2016-06-20,"Went last night for Fathers Day dinner around 9pm. NEVER COMING BACK. Let me say that our server Julie L was very sweet & the manager did comp our meal $11, but here's what we got: initially ignored while standing in lobby waiting to be seated. Bartender makes eye contact a number of times, says nothing. Wait staff see us, looks around then goes back to their own business. We look around: there are about 10-12 tables/booths with customers & the rest of the restaurant is completely empty. We wait still getting looks but not a single staff person saying, ""someone will be right there"" or acknowledging us at all for a while longer before we start talking about trying somewhere else. Just as we're about to leave, a very polite & courteous young guy comes out from somewhere in the back & gives us menus & seats us. Julie L comes to the table with a smile & introduces herself then takes our order for drinks & appetizers while we look at menu. Hubby orders a margarita on the rocks, received margarita blended. He very politely shows Julie, who apologizes as she says she wrote on the rocks on the ticket & takes away the blended drink to return with one on the rocks. Hubby takes one sip, stirs the ice & sees ***DEAD FLY*** in the drink. I'm grossed out & want to leave immediately but he says to give them a chance bec it's our first time eating here. We flag Julie down, she apologizes & brings hubby new drink which he says is much better so we stay. Our appetizers arrive & they're hot & fresh. We give our order (Parmesan shrimp steak: medium rare, smoked double steaks: rare & egg: over medium) to Julie, who asks what sides my husband wants with his meal (baked potato & 4-cheese mac), then she leaves. She comes back later to ask me what sides I want with my meal because she didn't realize my meal came with 2 sides. So I order crispy bacon cheddar potatoes & mashed sweet potatoes & ask what soups they have tonight then order the French onion soup. She leaves while we eat our appetizers. She comes back again when we're halfway done to say they're out of the French onion soup, so I order the steak & black bean soup instead. A while later, the manager comes out (we assume she's the manager because she's in orange but never introduces herself) pauses to look at us before saying: ""Sorry about the fly in your drink. We really do try our best to get the flies out every morning (YUCK, had that fly been sitting in their ice or on a table since this morning???). We're also out of the mashed sweet potatoes & garlic mashed potatoes. And I know you ordered the French onion soup & were told that we're out of it, but we're also out of the steak & bean soup too but we do have tomato basil & tortilla chicken instead."" So I order the 4-cheese mac instead & agree to try the chicken tortilla soup. By now, I'm feeling like the guy on Sesame Street trying to order food at Grover's restaurant & something's always off. My soup arrives with our meals (it's hot, spicy & tasty) delivered by two other ppl. I start in on my soup when I look at my husband & he's staring at his plate. No shrimp Parmesan on the steak, broccoli in place of baked potato (the manager said only that they were out of all mashed potatoes so what happened?) & his steak looks well-done. At this point, we decide to just eat what's there instead of wasting more time sending it back so we flag Julie down & tell her that's not what we ordered. She looks at it & says, ""oh, you ordered the Parmesan shrimp... Do you want them to put some on top of your steak or serve some on the side?"" She's trying at least. We say no & just want to make sure we're not charged for the higher costing meal & she says that the manager will comp our bill. So we say okay & start eating. I eat most of my soup before starting on my meal: tiny egg on top with the yolk popped & pooled under the steak. Oh well. I cut into the steak, it's just okay tasting. Second bite the same. Go for third bite: *raw meat* the meat was still blue, shiny tendons... Inedible. Switch to corners of same steak & get only one bite before it's the same on the other side. Set all that aside & start on second 4oz piece: I only get just the two corners: raw, raw, raw inside. I have over 30+ yrs of experience with the difference between raw/blue & rare. Please don't even try to say that those steaks were cooked. I just pushed them aside & stopped eating at this point while hubby powered through his well-done, dry plain steak. The 4-cheese mac was okay on both our plates. Julie come back & says that the manager feels bad about our experience & would like to offer us a free dessert. At this point we just want to try to leave gracefully so we decline. Julie brings us our bill = my meal comped -$6, hubby's DEAD FLY MARGARITA= free, hubby's wrong meal comped -$5. With the other drinks & appetizers (apps @ happy hour prices) plus tip we paid +$65 for a memorably awful Fathers Day dinner.

We stopped going years ago because we got sick and tired of walking into this place and basically being ignored.  Typical Antioch Applebee's Experience: You walk into the restaurant and can literally stand there for 15 min or more without one person acknowledging you. They SEE you but for some reason appear to feel that if no one talks to you, you just might go away, making their lives much easier. Once you do get seated, it takes another good 15 min OR MORE to get a server to approach your table.  Then once you do order, it takes forever to get the food and it's SO inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad, you're  left wondering why you bothered. This scenario happened many times to us until we just decided to give up. So we stopped going.   It was so bad that it scared us off of going to any Applebees anywhere until not long ago, while visiting some friends in Lodi,  we wound up at their local Applebees for lunch and couldn't believe the difference. Fantastic service and food. We were amazed!  We thought maybe things have changed for the better so we decided to give  Antioch Applebee's another try.

We had been to the restaurant inside once before and liked it. Boy was I disappointed. The ribs weren't tender or meaty and were swimming in sticky sauce. I hated them. My sides were mac and cheese, which was another disappointment, no flavor at all , i hated it, and it's costs extra as a side? what nerve. I ordered a milkshake and they gave my husband the wrong flavor. To their credit they gave him another one at no charge and told him to keep the other one too. However, another disappointment. They don't use real whipped cream. You get a better milkshake at the drive thru, at least they use real whipped cream. They use that synthetic tasting kind.The onion rings were pretty good though. Hubby said his burger was just ok. Next time we want to take out i can guarantee it won't be at Applebee's.

33,Vinny M.,"Antioch, CA",17,2,3.0,1.0,2017-01-20,"Racial profiling and employees steeling money off gift cards.    First of all, I never care to leave reviews. I feel it's a waist of time as I run my own business and would rather spend free time with my family.  First bad experience happened a few days before Christmas. I sat at the bar to watch the warriors play. I found out they had a deal,  buy a $50 gift card, you get an extra $10 gift card that had to be used in the month of Jan.  I told the bartender, I wanted two $50 gift cards and gave her my credit card. She left, came back, handed me the phone and said we just have to verify this is your card. Now, I'm on the phone with someone, asking for my name, my mothers maiden name and the last 4 of my social security number. After I answered those questions the guy on the phone, says ok let me see if those are correct.  A red flag went off, usually they know right away if you answered correct or not. I asked the bartender who she called, she said the number on the back of my card, then she told me just to hang up. I asked if she can show proof of who she called. She said she couldn't because she dialed the number in the back in the kitchen. As far as I know I just gave out personal information to some random person over the phone. They said they had to call to make sure the amount was going to go through, I said it's a credit card, you'd know right away if it was going to go through.. I called my cc company to see if they received a call about verification. I was relived that they did, but still irritated about the entire situation. I asked the manager Luis, why couldn't they just ask to see my ID like the standard thing to do. His reply was that people have fake ID's. I ended up just getting the gift cards and leaving right after. I never in my life had a situation like this happen.  I ended up going back Jan 15th. After my meal, I gave the waitress, Megan  a $50 gift card and the two $10 gift cards. She gave me back one of the $10 gift cards and said I can only use one per visit. No problem, sign the receipt and tipped her and left.  Now today, Jan 20th after my meal, I gave the waiter the $50 gift card and the other $10 bonus card. He came back and said the balance was 0 on the $10 gift card and only $12 on my $50 gift card. I asked to talked to the manager and Luis came over.  I told him the situation last time I came in, the waiter taking both $10 cards and giving me back this one, that should of had $10 still on it and mentioned that I should have $25 out of the $50 gift card. I showed him proof of my receipt from last time and he said there nothing he can do about it. I asked him if he could just talk to the waiter since it was just a few days ago, but nothing.  Its not even all about the money it's about the principle, I'm showing proof and for a manager to basically shrug his shoulder and say he can't help, made me write this review. I told him it's fine, everything happens for a reason, paid for my meal and left.  I like apple bee's but I'll never go back to this one, I'd rate them 0 stars if I could. This place needs to work on their customer service, stealing money off gift cards and the entire experience with having to talk to someone from my credit card company just to use it, is ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=20,1.12,1.68,1.68,1.6360000000000001,1.4560000000000002

First I ordered a Roy Rodgers and it tasted like the syrup was rotten, so I asked for a new one and they fixed it. Then we ordered a sampler plate as an appetizer, it was okay except the spinach dip had hard cheese on top that wasn't warmed at all. The platter also had some mozzarella sticks that were cold and tough! My fiancé ordered a pasta with a corn salsa and some fried shrimp he received bland mac and cheese with some shrimp no corn salsa, no seasonings nothing just mac and cheese! He sent it back and ordered a mozzarella burger. After 20 minutes of waiting and as the rest of the table finished the waitress comes and tells us they are out of that dish. He then ordered wings which we eventually got and they were actually good. One thing that really bothered me was I saw a woman push a straw back into a glass with her hand standing by the bar and the waiter served it to another table. I complained to the manager and guess what, she was the same lady I saw push a straw back into a glass with her bare hands!

About a year ago, we were eating when a fight broke out between two different tables and the people started throwing steak knives at each other. The manager handled the crazy situation as best she could, and stayed professional in the middle of chaos. But, the overall feel of the restaurant is low quality, and this just reinforced that!

Ordered a 2 for $25 meal... asked for the ribs and it usually comes with coleslaw and fries, ended up getting broccoli and mashed potatoes. I'm not complaining but it's just funny how my order was messed up.  The third strike, I asked the server to put everything on a gift card and then the rest on cash, she does the complete opposite and so we had to wait for her to fix it. She ended up fixing it but shorted us some change, so we had to wait AGAIN. We asked to talk to the manager and he ended up fixing it for us but had an excuse that they were really busy.

My husband asked to speak to the manager, who was not the LEAST bit helpful.  He apologized, and told us that he would give us 10% off my husband's and my food (not the whole order).  We explained that our food was cold, and the waitress near us was chatting away to people she must have known, instead of helping refill iced tea, etc.  Our waitress took away our cold food   to have it remade.  We told her to put it in to-go boxes as our family had already eaten, and we didn't want to have everyone wait on us.  Meanwhile, 1 person in our party just received his wings appetizers (it was now 9:00), and he told the waiter that he didn't want to be charged the regular price since it was now Happy Hour.  He asked for an order of the same wings to go since he was starving by the time he got the wings.  We had to ask for refills of our iced tea, and several of us didn't even get refills.  We got our two boxed up meals, and the person who ordered the wings got the wrong wing order!!!  He just sent them back, and didn't bother to reorder.  When we received the bill, we noticed that after this horrible dinner, we were only given $5 off the bill!!!  My husband again asked to speak to the manager.  Husband told the manager that this was a horrible experience, and $5 off the tab was not going to cut it.  The manager said that he would speak with the general manager, and get back with us. He came back and removed $20 more off the bill.  This was still unacceptable, so my husband went back to speak with another one of the managers, who informed us that the general manager was not on site!!!  The other manager (male) had lied to us!  This other manager (female) ended up giving us a $40 gift certificate to an Applebee's of our choice and $60 off of our bill.  She made things right.  This entire time, that same waitress was chatting away with customers and other employees.  Horrible, horrible experience!  In all the Applebee's where we have eaten, this was the WORST.  Never had this happen at any other Applebee's, and will never eat at this particular establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=40,1.76,1.74,1.74,,1.7480000000000002
6,Von Christopher L.,"Hayward, CA",60,3,,2.0,2017-09-18,"BEWARE OF THE LATE NIGHT BAD SERVICE! This is probably my last time ever eating or ordering here.  22:30  Service - 0/5 - Waitress checked on my table twice the whole time and that's counting the time she came with drinks and to take my order. Passed my table over 10 times as I sat there waiting for her. It wasn't as if there were more people or anything. She only had two tables to wait.  Food - 2/5- I order the same thing every time. The four cheese mac with chicken. It's gotten worse every time. This particular time, it was cold flavorless noodles, with mildly warm  burnt crispy chicken on top. Management - 3/5- -at least the manager did all in his power to replace the food and make it a bit better, I guess. But still it's his team that fail so most fault is to him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.8,1.71,1.71,,1.7460000000000002

12,Kathleen L.,"Antioch, CA",43,10,1.0,1.0,2017-10-08,We have always loved going to Applebee's. They have delicious food and a great selection. But the last couple times we have been to Applebee's in Antioch have been a nightmare. Tonight we went six of us. They told us 35 minutes. We waited 45 and were told we probably wouldn't be seated for another half an hour. It is clear that this restaurant does not want our business. It's clear that there are not enough servers to handle the few people that are going to dinner there. We offered to sit at two different tables just so we could be seated. The hostess went asked the server if she could accommodate us and the server said no. We walked out and we will not ever go there again too bad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.84,1.72,1.72,,1.7680000000000002
11,Laura D.,"Antioch, CA",1,3,,1.0,2017-10-08,I will never again waste my time and money at Applebee's. Me and 20 of my guest received the worst service from Hillcrest Applebee's in Antioch. And the store manager Louis has me at a loss for words. His etiquette is a complete disgrace to restaurant management. We wasted 4 hours there because there is no communication between staff and poor customer service. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE! We will never be back and I will continue to tell everyone I know. Until corporate decides to do something to rectify our night of horror.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.84,1.72,1.72,,1.7680000000000002

My bf and I sat at the bar and he ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp, NO flavor.  I ordered the Bourbon steak Medium and it was well done and superrrr dry.  We ate cause we were hungry and waited so long for our food.  The bartender Johanna was new but nice and fast. She asked me if I wanted to return my steak but I was too hungry at the moment.  I added lotssss of A1 sauce to give it flavor. She recommended the brownie bites and they were delicious but how can you go wrong with brownies and a scoop of ice cream?  Won't be eating here everrrrr again.  Strictly drink and that's if Johanna is working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.84,1.68,1.68,,1.7440000000000002

My husband, daughter and I had dinner there, first of all, the menus were completely full of sticky stuff.   We order our food (2 for $20).  We asked for a steak, mine medium well, my husband's well-done, when the food arrived my steak was so raw (blood coming out) and my husband's steak was really pink in the middle.   Service was so bad.   As I mentioned, We order the 2 for $20 and my Daughter had a kids meal! When we got the check, to our surprise, we were charged $87.  They offered you things but they don't mention that all those things are extra charge!   To make matters worse my husband and I have tummy problems now!!   I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO APPLEBEES!!

Granted everyone and every place has a bad day so please keep this in mind as I write this review So I walked in the door It was greeted about 2 minutes later from a nice Young man who escorted us to a booth at the far end he said that was the only booth available we said we would wait for another one but he basically insisted that we set there , So we did .Shortly after that we realized why no one was sitting at that booth the phone was directly behind us within the 1st 5 minutes it rang over and over and over probably 10 times When the young man came by again we asked him if we could move to a different spot he replied that he was very busy and short handed that he didn't have time to do that for us but that our server would be able to help us when she got there .10 minutes later and I mean 10 minutes our server came to us asked us what we would want to drink My wife's reply to him was could we please move into another booth he replied I'll see what I can do and never returned At this time it had been over 20 minutes that we were inside of applebee's and didn't even get a drink .We just got up and moved to the bar .We should have stayed at the booth and put up with the service there and the phone ringing ,Because literally even sitting at the bar we waited another 10 minutes for our 1st 2 drinks which by the way were excellent I had a margherita silver patronne on the rocks with no salt I believe my wife had some sort of lemonade Non alcohol .Now get this part 10 minutes later we asked if we could order some appetizers as she never came to us after she brought the 1st drinks which by the way were empty at that point .We ordered our appetizers the sampler plate which really looked great that's all it did as we got that 7 or 8 minutes after our food arrived ,Once again not to be repetitive all of the food was great we took the appetizers home for our dog . Maybe we'll go back and try again another day like I said sometimes people or places have a bad day this was just our experience there. Stop and pick up a snack on your way there if you are in a hurry to eat ....lol.

1,Jared S.,"Antioch, CA",57,24,57.0,2.0,2017-12-02,"Came in with some of my family for a late dinner on Saturday evening. We received all around poor quality service throughout the night. Environment: Typical sports bar type interior. Casual setting with a full bar and a multitude of different seating options. Nothing remarkable, nothing bad. Service: Awful. Just awful. We ordered appetizers and waters to begin. The waters were dirty, so we asked for replacements. The waters came a full 40 minutes later after asking 3 times. The Appetizer was a sampler with a dip that should have come with chips. The chips did not come until we asked for them twice. Two managers had to come around and take care of our needs. We finally ordered our food a full 50 minutes after taking our seats. The food finally arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes after sitting. I was honestly so tired of dealing with the employees I just gave up, ate some, paid, and left. There was a game charge added to our bill that we didn't request or add, this had to be removed by a manager, extending our stay to a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Food: The appetizers were decent but certainly not spectacular. My sisters steak was cold. My steak was ordered medium rare and came out medium well. If you have a lot of time to burn and don't care too much about quality or service, you might find yourself here. Otherwise avoid it. Bonus: May come back for the Dollar Long Island Ice Teas, they were pretty good Edit: They comped us for the appetizers for the service issues so I'll change from 1 star to 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.88,1.68,1.68,,1.76

Just about every negative thing that has happened to other reviewers was experienced by  my wife and I. Do not waste your time and money there. My only regret is not reading previous reviews.  You'll receive better service and a higher quality of food by going to the Shell service station next door.

8,Debbie M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-26,By far the worst service i have ever had at your Applebee's. We eat there at least twice a month. We got our appetizers with out silverware. Had to get the bus boy and he didn't bring it out then our server finally brought it over. My salad came out without any dressing. Had to wave down our sever and she never came back with it and went on her break. The girl that took over was very sweet but still took time to come out with my dressing. It was over 15 mins before my dressing came after my salad had been sitting there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5,1.4,1.65,1.65,,1.55

I made sure to tell her the money left on the table is for her only. It amazed me that we sat for 15 minutes and no drink order was taken at all until we flagged Lacey down. The guest greeter Gabby could have very well took our drink order. She was very sweet as well but she could be cross trained to be a helping hand to the waitresses when it's backed up like this night was, maybe a training issue? The booth behind us also complained of the slow service. Do not blame them it was bad.  Anyway, Lacey your awesome at helping us out when you didn't need to. You could have stayed at your station behind the bar. Please Applebee's management speed up your servicing crew.
