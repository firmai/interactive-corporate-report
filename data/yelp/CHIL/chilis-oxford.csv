Mark D.,"Pflugerville, TX",12,53,17,4.0,11/11/2017,"Visiting my son in Oxford, Mississippi, chili's was the obvious choice after 13 hours in a minivan.  The establishment was full of hungry college students.  The service was great, the food was well seasoned and prepared, and we had a great time!  And, the French fries were tastefully seasons with salt and pepper!!  Chili's should be reconsidered for a meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Lana F.,"Mechanicsville, Richmond, VA",2,11,19,1.0,9/9/2017,"Tonight was probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. They were pretty busy, so someone greeted our table before the server and got us drinks. After waiting a while the server came to the table and without any greeting pushed us to order. He did repeat the order back for correctness. When it arrived at the table, a person in my party's food was incorrect. This wouldn't be a big deal but she had dietary restrictions. No apology or solution was offered when she pointed out it was wrong.  The rest of the food was okay. We eat our food and go long periods of time without interacting with the server, even after requesting things like ranch or drink refills. We waited so long after we finished eating that we had to grab to-go boxes from the bartender who was across the restaurant. Again, the server never apologized or even acknowledged the issue. We wait 10+ more minutes to pay because we needed the appetizer split. The server rolled his eyes when I nicely asked for this to be done. We watched tables that had been seated long after us eat and leave before we ever got our check.  There were so many things that went wrong that could have been fixed if the server had a better attitude or a manager had dropped by. As someone that's worked as a server and host for almost 7 years, I get that things go wrong but the server tonight just outright did not care about taking care of his guests. Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Mike J.,"Oxford, MS",0,2,,5.0,1/11/2018,Always clean and great service. Recommend the bar area. The bartenders are 10 for 10. Will make you laugh. #TreatYoSelf,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Kevin S.,"Grenada, MS",25,8,,1.0,11/22/2017,Absolutley the worst steak that I have eaten in many years. I paid $18 for a ribeye steak and got a small steak about the size and thickness of a pork chop. It was supposed to be medium rare but it was well done and very tough. Don't waste your money!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Wilson C.,"Oxford, MS",317,1,,5.0,4/24/2017,"Always an unbelievable and indescribable experience when I visit this Chilis. If you're in a bad mood or feeling bad when you enter, no worries, you'll leave feeling like an Olympic gold medalist. Started off with the bottomless strawberry lemonade (great choice) then proceeded got the triple dipper as an appetizer for me and my friends. The service was a 12/10 and the meal was  . Chilis is the dankest experience you will have in Oxford by far. Can't wait to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Graham L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",121,23,,1.0,9/2/2017,Went in at 11:30pm and said they're closed when the hours on the door say 12am !!!! Torqued !!!! Never again !!!! #NotMyChili's GO REBS,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Sandra L.,"Holly Springs, MS",0,3,,5.0,11/2/2017,I love our local Chili's! Our service is always good and so is the food. They have the best burgers in town!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Joeseph S.,"Grenada, MS",0,23,,1.0,6/29/2017,"Waited until summer, actually, to try again. It was FREEZING again. We asked our server why it was so cold and this time was told that the restaurant does it on purpose so that people won't linger and they can turn more tables.  If this is true, I would love to give ZERO stars. But even if they're still just incompetent (see earlier review), I STILL give them only one star because they haven't fixed the problem AND they haven't bothered to respond to my review here on Yelp. Either way, it shows that Chilis doesn't care about customer comfort. Just customer $$$.  So, even though today's food was ok, I'll never even CONSIDER going back unless and until a manager / owner / etc contacts me regarding this review.  ---- The ONLY -- ONLY -- reason that I'm giving this place two stars is for the food and the server. The food was tasty and the server was sincere, if somewhat ineffectual.  Problem: It's a week before Christmas and yes, even Mississippi gets cold. We sat in a booth by some windows and had A/C blowing directly on us from above. The whole section was like this, not just our table. Everyone nearby was wearing a coat or a sweater. We asked the server to turn the A/C down so that we could warm up, but he relayed that the manager said it could not be adjusted locally. We asked to speak with the manager because this sounded like BS, but the manager never bothered to come out to speak with us. So much for management caring about customers. The server was sympathetic, but was unable to help. (Otherwise, he was friendly and solicitous, which we appreciated.) Conclusions: 1. If Chili's can't adjust their temperature locally, then the next time we'll try them is in the spring.  2. If Chili's can't train their Oxford managers to personally respond to customer concerns, then they don't deserve our business, regardless of the season of the year.  3. If you're comfortable feeling unvalued as a customer, by all means, go. They'll be at least one empty booth waiting for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Adwait P.,"Oxford, MS",0,1,,4.0,9/18/2016,The ambience was good.... The food was really tasty and good. There was minor problem in the service as the waitress was slow and forgot our orders. Other than that the overall experience was very good and worth visiting again for sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Allyson W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,1,,1.0,10/31/2016,"I visited the Chili's in Oxford, Mississippi on the night of Oct. 29th to celebrate my birthday.  Since it was a home game for Ole Miss, all the other restaurants were packed. We noticed that it was quite empty and we were promptly seated. We gave the waiter our drink order which included the 2 for 1 frozen margarita special. (He didn't ask for id) He brought both margarita's to the table. I asked him if he would take one back while I drink the first one.  He said he couldn't do that because the bartender would get confused & it would be too much pressure.  That didn't make sense to me since the place was empty & since he was my waiter, he would know if I had two drinks or not.  I politely asked to speak with the manager.  He didn't want to get the manager and wanted to know if I wanted to take it off. I told him that I wanted my drinks, just not at the same time.  The manager, Jameson, came to the table with a terrible disposition right away. I told him why I asked for him and he was very rude & disrespectful. He said that it was corporate's policy that they bring both margarita's at the same time. We told him that if that is the case, please show us were that is written. He didn't because it couldn't because that was a bogus lie!! He got loud & said no, either we pay for the drinks or leave. I told him that I was not paying for a drink that I didn't even touch yet and I came here to eat. He wasn't having it and basically kicked us out. We were not loud or disrespectful to him or his employees.  Just wanted some clarification.  To be treated this way due to me not wanting a watered down drink is horrific. So we left & we will not be back. Coming from working in a customer service environment, this is not how you handle a simple situation like this Jameson. I have escalated it to corporate so that they can show me where it is written that you have to bring both drinks to the table at once.  Horrible management and horrible service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Rusty S.,"Oxford, MS",0,6,,4.0,1/19/2017,"We've been to Chili's restaurants in multiple states and can count on a good experience with only a couple of exceptions.  The location in Oxford is either fairly new or has been renovated and looks up to date, has a new menu with a generally good selection.  The server provided good service and came back to the table to make sure everything was good and refill drinks.  Even though it was pretty busy the food still came out fast, hot and tasted great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Wentworth P.,"Oxford, MS",0,3,,4.0,11/2/2015,"Now when the standard is set a high as Applebee's it's going to quite tough to achieve. I came in this fine dining establishment and was simply astounded by the atmosphere and the fun times had by all. The food was the icing on this dining deluxe cake, Applebee's you may have a competitor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Harrison A.,"Atlanta, GA",222,5,,5.0,4/17/2016,"I'm from Chattanooga, TN which has a plethora of Chili's restaurants and this one in Oxford, MS is my favorite location to go to. Great margs! I love going here on Sunday's along with the church crowd. Great place to enjoy a meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
John L.,"Collierville, TN",16,34,3,2.0,1/5/2014,"Typical chain restaurant. Staff could be better trained. Food very average.  We sat close to kitchen door.....way too loud noise coming from kitchen staff, not all work related. Poor management overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Phillip S.,"Coldwater, MS",3,12,4,5.0,9/29/2010,Wow.....service was wonderful...didn't know what to expect considering Oxford being a college town. Food was great...beverages were cold....and o overall wonderful atmosphere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
Anthony R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",2,13,1,1.0,2/19/2011,"I couldn't let the only review of this be a 5 star. That's insane. Chili's is as horrible in Oxford as it is everywhere. Prepackaged frozen foods served luke warm with heaps of sugar and God knows what else as ingredients. If you're used to MacDonald's and Burger King, then sure, you'll be happy here. Otherwise, stay away from this one, as well as any other location. Notice how every Chili's is in front of a Walmart? Just another chain sucking the soul out of the American palette, not to mention selling you obesity at low prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxford
