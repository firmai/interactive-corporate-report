15,Louis R.,"New Paltz, NY",0,37,,1.0,2012-06-29,"My girl friend and I have visited this particular Applebee's several times, the last time being during the Memorial Day weekend, May, 2012. We both ordered the 2 for $20.00 dinner special, and we both ordered the steak. My steak was so tough, that I could not eat about 25% of it! To tell you the truth, I would not feed that steak to a DOG! On June 5, 2012, I phoned the Poughkeepsie Applebee's and spoke to the General Manager, Tom Bauer about the issue that I had with their steak. Tom stated that he would get back to me regarding this issue, but, alas, he never contacted me, again. I should also state that I have ordered the same steak in the past, and have had the same issue with this particular cut of steak which is being offered as part of their 2 for $20.00 dinner special, which includes one (shared) appetizer and 2 dinner entrees. Also, their mixed vegetables are habitually overcooked. Additionally, the side dishes that they offer are very small in size. Finally, they habitually do not monitor the condition of their bathrooms, frequently running out of soap and paper towels. Also, the garbage pails in the bathrooms are generally overflowing! Based upon the above, we will NOT be visiting Applebee's at any Applebee's location, which, of course, includes the Poughkeepsie Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
13,Mike K.,"Highland, NY",9,20,8.0,1.0,2013-02-22,Been here several times. There is something seriously wrong with this place. The service is consistently disgusting. Just the other day I wait 20 minutes for Togo boxes and a check. The manager on duty was a dick and tried to intimidate me an stare me down. Why is it hard to service 6 tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
14,Mikki P.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",15,29,30.0,4.0,2013-07-08,Usually I am not fond of Applebee's food or the service. But today my son and went here for lunch our server Lexa was freakin awesome so good with Nick we enjoyed our time here and the chicken and shrimp was great never mind the wonton tacos hole shit that was great had a great lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
12,Jesse B.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",6,19,1.0,4.0,2013-11-26,I only come here for late night half price apps and I absolutely love them. I get the same order every time- mozz sticks and the sweet and spicy boneless wings. Wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings in my opinion,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
11,Melissa M.,"Walden, NY",0,12,,1.0,2014-09-28,"WAAAAY TOO SALTY!!! I ordered my steak ""as rare as you can legally make it"" and it came out well done. Dirty utensils, everyone was complaining. The waitress was nice and I felt bad that she had to get all of  the complaints about the food. They didn't even have silverware ready until 20 minutes past our arrival.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
7,Tim M.,"Sandy Hook, CT",0,2,,1.0,2015-02-28,"Now that they've shrunk their portions and kept the relatively high prices, I'll never come back. Even when appetizers are half price, a 6 inch wide quesadilla is not worth $8.29. That's around 75 cents a bite, if you're wondering. I know I won't be coming back, I can take what little money my college self has elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
9,Brittany B.,"Hyde Park, NY",0,4,,5.0,2015-03-18,"I had ordered from their to go menu and got into a car accident on the way there, but had already paid for my food. When I called to apologize, they offered to re-make my meal for me the next night! The staff was more than understanding and very polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
4,Marvin O.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,72,130.0,5.0,2015-08-16,I had THE best experience ever and i often frequent Applebee's and usually I feel like it's just mediocre!! However I was driving up the road by Marist and noticed this Applebee's and I said what the hell let's try it out. So I get seated and my server is Priscilla the most kind hearted server I have yet to see at any establishment!! Quick attentive service with a smile I must say this experience has made me a customer!!!!! Will be back often,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
5,Stefanie I.,"North Hollywood, CA",124,41,54.0,3.0,2015-08-29,"Bad start with the spinach & artichoke dip. It tasted great, but 3 tablespoons of dip for a plate full of chips just doesn't cut it.  Took a chance on the riblets aka charred carbonized meat on sharp bones.  Nuff said? Dad was not impressed by them either: ""adequate"".  Sis liked her chicken tenders: ""how do you f--k up chicken tenders? They were good. They were bar food.""  Mom ate half her steak and took the other half home.  Normally I like Applebee's and our waitress was pleasant (even though she forgot my lemon) but, just not impressed with what we had for what it cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
10,Peter I.,"Rhinebeck, NY",0,20,,1.0,2015-12-11,"After a not bad experience in Kingston, NY we came to this location across from Marist college. I wish the food would look somewhat close to the pictures in the menu. What we got were very small portions with a few sliced potatoes thrown around, my wife had the meat with the whole grains (really bad, even smelled bad)! And the server? the worst in a long time, had very little knowledge of the menu, was disinterested in us and her job, was friendly to another table (her friends), Going to a chain you expect some uniformity, obviously not in this one, bad service and a kitchen that should look at the pictures on the menu and try to match that. Never to return...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
6,William S.,"Pine Plains, NY",4,12,3.0,2.0,2015-12-20,"it is a sunday night and my girlfriend's daughter decided to treat us to Applebee's for my gf's birthday... not a good choice,  I had the riblets, that were overcooked with small pieces of bone throughout. .. the fries were luke warm.  The 2 kids had overcooked burgers that were not garnished as they should have been. the waitress kept getting our drinks wrong... not up to snuff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
8,Catherine A.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,16,,1.0,2016-05-24,"Fries were cold. Food wasn't hot. Had to search for the chicken in fajita wrap. Waitress said it would be .75 cents extra to switch out raw onions on a burger for fried onions. Got the burger and there was literally one piece of fried onion on top, it was ridicules. Got the bill only to see we were actually charged $1.49 rather than .75 cents. The waitress explained that the price went up and she didn't realize it. It was actually the first Applebee's that we've dined at that was awful. Very disappointing. A waste of money.  Would not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
2,Tim D.,"Lagrangeville, NY",99,9,,5.0,2016-09-02,It's not unedible Since this isn't long enough screw applebees frozen food I don't like it here and I only came cuz I wanted to use my new microwave,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
1,Jack T.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",19,25,,4.0,2017-06-04,"I had their new special: a 4 ounce sirloin,shrimp on a skewer, and broccoli - for $15, it was well worth it; just the right portions for me and all very tasty. Danielle was a superbly good waitress.  Also the brownie bites dessert was excellent. I recommend Applebee's for the "" middle of the pack"" restaurant...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
3,Joe N.,"Wassaic, NY",0,6,,2.0,2017-07-14,"Went to the Applebee's in Poughkeepsie NY today with my wife. We ordered the two for $ 20.00 and a cup of coffee which with the tip came out to be $ 28.00, we didn't mind that. How ever, the portions of both orders were extremely small. We stopped going to Applebee's about 9 months ago for the same reason. But we returned about two month ago and everything was back to normal, portion reasonable. If your hungry and on a lunch break, don't go to Applebee's, cause you'll leave hungry and disappointed. I believe its a management problem, the owner's needs to get better managers that truly understand the Sport Bars restaurant business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
0,Chris J.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",68,24,8.0,3.0,2017-11-10,"We were seated quickly and our drinks and appetizers came fast. Food also. Problems... the waitress seemed to be working most of the restaurant, little things... Never came back to see my soda which was at the edge of the table was empty until we got our check, my burger I asked for no pink and brought it home. When I went to reheat it, it was totally pink.  I am not a big Applebees fan, and this just confirms this. Simple solution give the server less tables and she can be more attentive",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-poughkeepsie-3,,,,,
