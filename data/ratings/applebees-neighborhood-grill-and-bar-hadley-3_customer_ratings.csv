6,Ash T.,"Basingstoke and Deane, United Kingdom",0,26,5.0,5.0,2014-08-19,"We had decided to go here as we were tired after going on a long drive. We arrived and were greeted by a fantastic bartender Alexa.  We have only recently discovered sitting at the bar is the best way to find out about the area and then to meet new people.  Alexa was fab, not only making the best Margarita but also giving us a fab deep fried Oreo cookie!! She was plight funny and a good Applebee's representative.  We had two entree's and were sooo full.  Alexa you made our night - thank you !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
9,William D.,"Bernardston, MA",0,11,,3.0,2014-09-21,Just had the fish and chips and this is what I think: The portion size was good but the fish was fried at too low a temp. for too long and was sopping with oil. The fries were good but the ones sitting under the fish were again glistening with grease. The service was good at first but halfway through the meal the waitress was pushy and insistent on getting the bill taken care of. It felt like the did not want us there and were pushing us out the door. My companion had the turkey club sandwich and was missing the bacon that should have been on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
11,Pete K.,"Northampton, MA",1,24,1.0,2.0,2014-12-18,The hadley Ma Applebees is horrible.... My wife and I went there December 18.. She had the sirloin and all the vegetables were hard as a rock.. I got the shrimp with brockly and pasta.. And it was the smallest portion I have ever seen and it wasn't cheap and I had two pieces of broccoli.. The entire meal was bad.. I will say the manager did come over and apologize and I appreciate that. But still I have to say the food was a rip off.. Sorry but if I were you I would stay away from this place.. Chilis is  a million times better and its right up the road,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
7,Heather T.,"Montague, MA",1,2,1.0,4.0,2015-03-15,I wasn't sure if Applebees would be a great place to stop for a quick meal. It was a great place and will go back. The hostess was very friendly and opened the door as we walked in. Our waitress was a very friendly. The food was hot and came out very quick considering the RestUrant was full !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
10,Sara T.,"Trumbull, CT",0,1,,4.0,2015-07-10,"A great dining experience for us and our three tired teenagers. Food was tasty and as expected. Our server, Meagan, was sweet, accommodating, knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent service. She was a fabulous server!  We would definitely come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
5,Rina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,2.0,3.0,2015-09-04,"I went to this Applebee's for dinner on Tuesday night, a ritual when my father drops me off at college, and was disappointed with the service for the first time.  We could hear people complaining about the speed of the food and one customer behind us was incredibly upset.  When the food arrived he claimed it was undercooked and got it remade.  The manager covered his bill, but the customer was obviously still perturbed. Meanwhile, our table did not get even our appetizers for almost an hour. Just as we discussed leaving, the buffalo chicken bites came out.  When we explained to the new waitress (our old waitress had 12 tables to handle and looked far too overwhelmed to even breathe) how long we waited, we watched the manager turn a blind eye to our issue.  He walked to every table but ours and only came over when we expressed our distaste with the service.  Even worse, a table that came after us got their meal and appetizer before those chicken bites even hit the table!  I remember a women across us yelling, ""That's bull!  You've been waiting here forever."" The manager did discount our meal by cutting it in half and he apologized for the slow service. He explained there was a leak (right above the kitchen door I might add. It was the only thing I could stare at since our plates were non-existent) and he couldn't manage the kitchen as effectively. Would I go there again?  Maybe if I'm in Hadley and really craving something they have on the menu.  Our food was alright enough for that. However, would I go out of my way? Probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
4,Will H.,"Chicopee, MA",207,187,92.0,1.0,2015-10-09,This place sucks!!!!!! It took almost 40 mins for my app to take ita not even busy. This waitress sucks. The rm is a cool lady,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
2,Michael K.,"Amherst, MA",0,2,,1.0,2016-02-23,"So I came here after a long day of work to enjoy some nice apps with my friends. I met my friend and the fun started but our waitress wouldn't even look at us and we were seated in a table that wasn't cleaned (don't ask me why there were many clean tables around us). Then I got my salad which tasted like it was washed in the Atlantic Ocean!! Too salty for my taste, I think I got a disease, literally. I got home after hours of waiting for our mediocre food only to have explosive bowel movements and I was throwing up all the salt water lettuce! I think I was poisoned.  NEVER AGAIN, SWEET DEVIL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
0,Shannon R.,"Enfield, CT",101,170,26.0,3.0,2017-03-13,"Being that this Applebee's is in close proximity to my place of employment, we have eaten here many times as part of someone's birthday celebration, and for many end-of-semester celebrations.  We usually arrive by 11:45 and are done by 1:45, so these are the only times I am able to comment on accurately.  We generally have decent and timely service at this Applebees location.  The wait staff are, for the most part, friendly and accommodating to our large groups, and they process our tax exempt credit card without issue.   The food is pretty hit-or-miss.  Sometimes everything is excellent, and sometimes food comes out cold, overdone, dripping in oil, or stale.  I would say 70% of the time we have no issues, and the rest of the time there are minor issues that are easily remedied.  Only once did we have a truly awful meal. But because of the distance/convenience, it's a place we tend to come back to.  If you go in for lunch M-F, you should have an overall fine experience.  Especially if you come in during the school year when business from the five colleges keep the food more fresh and the wait staff more chipper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
3,Delia P.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,7,,5.0,2017-04-18,"Went here for the first time, my boyfriend had been previously and when Panera was way to busy for lunch we stopped in. A very nice man brought us to a table and accommodated the fact that my boyfriend is in a straight leg brace and needed a booth to spread out in. Our waitress, Amanda I believe, was very nice, very quick with our orders and answered my questions about my burger. I ordered the new caprese mozzarella burger and it was amazing. Little much with the onions, I couldn't even fit it in my mouth, but the flavors were just incredible. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely will be stopping in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
1,A B.,"Manhattan, NY",8,211,53.0,1.0,2017-07-27,"I'm a huge Applebee's fan...yet, after coming here initially thinking that a franchise restaurant is the same everywhere...NOT...the side order of sweet potato fries which you pay extra for portion was surprisingly very small...had to order another side order which was marginally more...strange...my wife asked for a medium rare steak...first one came well-done...the second one came basically raw..the management gave no care to check up on us and could care less when they heard of what happened...of a party of 4 only 3 of us were able to eat...shame",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hadley-3,,,,,
