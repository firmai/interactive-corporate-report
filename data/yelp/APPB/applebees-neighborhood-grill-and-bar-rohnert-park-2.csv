Susie W.,"Penngrove, CA",2,9,,2.0,12/6/2015,Just needed to eat! Ugh!  Zucchini was spoiled all the way through!  I pointed it out and was told it was grill marks. I'm 71. I know grill marks!  There were corn kernels and onion rings in my wedge salad!  Come on Applebee's pay these people and up what could be good''.

Kira W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",91,104,28,2.0,8/18/2012,"I think our bartender was hungover but the service was just plain frustrating today. We were starving after dealing with consumer hell in Rohnert Park and desperately needed quick nourishment to keep going (and a beer to wash it down with). Our bartender was very out of it. He was about to take our food order when the phone rang - so he took the phone call while we waited. After the phone call he ignored us for about five minutes (we were sitting right in front of his computer terminal). We kept trying to catch his eye to remind him that we never got to place our order. I finally piped up and said, ""We're ready to place our food order,"" but he was too busy talking to the manager about some shift switch to hear me. My husband finally got his attention and we were finally able to place our order - but I think there was some palpable tension after that. I felt like we were suddenly ""rude customers"" or something. Before we sat down, there were a few items leftover from the people before us. The bartender had grabbed the glassware but never cleaned the bar area so I was sitting at someone else's sticky mess. My husband had to ask the bartender to clean up the mess so I could eat in a clean environment. I've been served by this bartender before and it was okay - which makes me think he was out of it - but Hubs and I were already on edge with the shopping hell and the service was pretty vacant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=40
Amelia E.,"Rohnert Park, CA",170,129,18,1.0,7/3/2014,"Came here late at night, 11:30. The service wasn't the best... She didn't seem like she wanted to service. Actually, as if she was mad that we even came in. that wasn't comforting. As soon as my boyfriend and I ate our food, we left. We came with a group of 6 people. They stayed until 12:30.

Sandy P.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,10,,2.0,1/17/2015,We lunched at Applebee's in Rohnert Park today. While the help was very courteous and the food okay except my Won Aton Chicken Tacos we were so spicy I could hardly eat them.  My main complaint was my knife was dirty (quickly replace by our waitress) and after a couple of bites I realized that my plate was also dirty.  I should have said something but we were in a time crunch and I was afraid a new lunch would take too long.  No more Applebee's for me,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=40
Melissa M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/16/2015,"DISGUSTING! I was forced to give it at least 1 star. Everything was beyond over cooked, it was welded! It was also only slightly warmer than room temperature. One person in our party ordered the Oriental chicken salad and there was hardly any salad in it. It was mostly those canned crunchy noodles. The chicken on top must have been left by a previous customer, then chopped up and thrown in the ""saladless salad"". Somebody else ordered a portobello mushroom burger and she struggled to find the mushrooms. I hadn't been to Applebee's in years... ever since my mom and brother got E.coli from there.

After rejecting a valid ID that banks accept everyday, the service just got worse and worse. The girl was just a bitch. Took forever to bring us water and soda! Appetizers took to long as well, I got my appetizer with my dinner!!!?!?!?? The girl didn't even apologize once for the wait. I saw people who sat down after us eat before us. Seems like the waitresses weren't fairly servicing each table. As we were not even half way through our dinners, she brought us our checks and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else or dessert! At that point I didn't feel like ordering anything from this place. The check was incorrect and She took even more time to fix it. The manager who was helping her correct it, did not apologize and neither did the waitress. This place is poorly managed. At least the rohnert park location. Horrible customer service!!!

Wulfstan C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",21,427,,1.0,8/26/2010,"Well, I feel obligated to post a review of this place even though it's a massive chain and not the type of place I normally even think of going to, while I'm sure most people have had some experience with a branch.  This review is essentially the same for both the other Applebee's I've had the misfortune of going to - one in Salem, Oregon, and in the Natomas area of Sacramento.  I must note that the first time I went to one (Salem), I had never been and also saw nowhere else to eat at the time while the other two I went to because I was meeting others there.  I hope never to be back. This place is a chain, and pretty much a paradigm of what I detest about so many chains - cardboard, cookie cutter and horrid in every way.  First, the food is absolutely terrible, bland, salty, and characterless - mass produced crud that tastes mass-produced.  Second, much of the food is pseudo fancy, sounding like haute cuisine made available for the masses yet mass-produced crud using salt, fat, etc., to make up for anything resembling character so that one would be far better off just ordering a burger and those are utterly mediocre.  Third, the place itself (each one) is disgusting and off-putting - fake, mass-produced ""neighbourhood"" ersatz-idiosyncrasy made to look like a genuine, idiosyncratic local place that has accumulated memorabilia over the years but in reality is a cookie-cutter copy of some corporate marketing ploy.  Since it is so obviously fake, yet tries to immitate that sort of individual character, it is far, far worse than if it were a just plain, obviously no-frills diner appearance that didn't try to mask its mass-produced nature.  This place, and all Applebee's I've been to, deserve negative stars in reality.  Avoid these places at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=40
John K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",76,41,3,1.0,7/6/2010,"I used to love Applebee's food but the quality has gone down a lot in the past few years.  I still enjoy going to have the sampler platter and some drinks.  Recently I went to the Rohnert Park Applebees with some friends from work (all of us are military).  The sampler was yummy as always and the drinks were great.   The reason I am giving it only one star is because of what happened when the bill came. As always I ask if they offer a military discount.  In the past (at this store and others) I was given the managers discount.  This time when I asked I was told ""Absolutely NO military discounts"".  I am fine with not getting a discount, but the way she said it I found to be very rude.  When I told her that I was given discounts in the past she told me that I don't know why they didn't and they shouldn't have.  If she would have had said ""I'm sorry we don't have one I wish we did"", I would have be fine with this. Is the absolutely NO military discount thing come from corporate? And its not as if I'm expecting a discount, but the attitude was all wrong. In the past I had always gotten a 10% discount, so pretty much I didn't have to pay tax.   I won't be going back to this Applebees, mostly due to the attitude from the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=40

Sydney C.,"Cotati, CA",177,8,8,1.0,10/7/2017,"I give MOST of the staff 5 stars!! So cheers to ALL of you ESPECIALLY Carolyn the bartender last night 10/6/17. She not only keeps us coming back as often as we do. But with this $1 margarita promotion/fiasco she kept her cool and made sure we had everything we needed and that we were happy as could be the whole time we were there.  Now, the reason it's NOT a 5 star review and it's only 1 is because the manager last night, Socorro, did not do anything to make our experience better or worth coming back in all honesty. 1 her attempt of helping was more damaging then if she had not even tried..because she started to confuse everybody else and then makes their jobs harder. 2 my arm had hit my margarita glass and the 1/4 of the drink that was left in the glass had spilt on the counter top. (Oops!) She stood there and watched me while I was cleaning it up with one white little napkin... until I rose my arm and asked her if she could assist me by getting me more napkins, sense she was just standing and leaning on the bar spacing out doing nothing while EVERYONE ELSE was bussing there butts! She then wiped it down, but didnt even offer to grab me another drink! I also want to be very clear, I WAS NOT trying to get anything for free... but an offer to get a paying customer at THE BAR for another drink would have only made sense right?  Side note: Socorro turned down a group of people who wanted to order about 10 shots of patron..... she also made them feel like they were being the problem by asking for that quantity of shots.. even though they were a big group. You could tell the one woman talking to her seemed very offended and confused. now that's just blowing off business and loosing money... Now, back to when we first arrived. She wrote our names down, my boyfriend and myself, then walked away. After waiting about 20 minutes (which we had no issue with the wait. It was crazy busy. We get it.) BUT THEN a group of 3 walked in and ends up knowing some employees there or maybe even worked there, but IMMEDIATELY got sat and skipped the wait that about 10 other parties were patiently and fairly waiting for.  I've been in the serving industry for almost 10 years, so I get that if a coworker or close friend that comes in and if you can possibly sneak them in and have them skip the wait, then do it. Depending on the circumstance. Let me just say this was NOT the right circumstance lol. & To do it in front of ALL the people waiting AND to do it after looking at the reservation sheet seeing me and my boyfriends name next, but not knowing or seeing our party size (2) is not okay. Due to Socorro not doing her job..I politely approached the host after my boyfriend walked out and told the host to take us off the list and brought it to her attention how I noticed she allowed her friend/coworker to sit first... she was apologetic asked for my name and saw my name was next but didn't know the party size, but immediately said she could seat us right away. which all comes back to Socorro not doing her job effectively and writing down that one detail.  Not to mention while I was waiting to speak with the other manager on the floor that night, I over heard multiple servers complaining about Socorro being more of a hassle then helpful. I was informed she was new to FOH managing and usually manages in the back of house. But from the experience I had last night with her ""running"" things and being in charge and ""trying"" to help may not be a good fit and didn't allow us to have our usual great/smoothly ran experience.  We love Carolyn and Jason! Those two are the reason we will continue to come and give our business! So make sure to give them a huge high five from the both of us!  I usually never take the time out of my day to write this long of a feedback or any feedback in general whether it be good or bad. But in this case, it needed to be communicated. And it's also about time I give my two fav Applebee's employees a great shoutout! GO JASON AND CAROLYN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2

Hiroko O.,"San Francisco, CA",9,3,1,4.0,1/16/2016,"Wow I don't understand why everyone hates this place. I have only been to an Applebee's maybe once about a decade ago, but my husband got a gift card here so we had to use it. I looked up the reviews here to get some recommendations and saw everyone just hated it here! So I was expecting crap food and horrible service but I got the opposite. I walked in on a fairly busy Saturday night and was immediately greeted at the door by a friendly host. I told them I was looking to order something to take home and they gave me a menu to look at and a few minutes later a friendly girl named Caty came over. She was really patient and gave me great recommendations. I told her I had a $25 gift card and with her help I got out of there for $25.54, perfect :) As I waited, I was asked at least 3 times if I had been helped yet by obviously busy waiters who just happened to see me on their way to the kitchen, but they took the time to stop and make sure I was taken care of. There were quite a few people running around. I saw many waiters checking in on guests at tables to make sure everything was alright, all of this completely contrary to what other reviews on here have said. Granted, I did not stay in and dine at a table, but there isn't a whole lot to do while waiting for food so I just people watched and saw all around great service. Caty was especially friendly and attentive. I didn't wait too long for the food and when I got home and ate it with my husband we were both pretty happy with it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest food in creation but it's pretty damn decent. I'm especially a fan of their many options of flavored ice teas that don't seem to be sweetened very much, if at all. Perfect for someone like myself who doesn't drink soda and tries to stay away from overly sweetened drinks. And all the beverages were only $0.99. The only negative thing I could possibly say is that they have a special to go entrance that I parked in front of, but the door said ""use other entrance,"" so I walked all the way around to the front only to be told that I should have in fact gone in through the to go door. Pretty silly but now I know. I didn't mean to write so much, and I don't super love the place, but it really doesn't deserve some of these other reviews so I just rambled on sorry xD",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2

After waiting 15 minutes for my drink I was told (as they set my sisters drink down) that they were out of the alcohol to make my drink...and I'm wondering why he didn't tell me this before my sisters drink came out?

The service was bad, they tried to jack up the prices when I wanted to make a substitution, they didn't have the basics, and the food was inedible. No 1000 Island dressing? What restaurant doesn't have 1000 Island? Then, when my waitress ignored my request for a refill of tea yet again, a different waitress told me that they *did* have 1000 Island ""in the back"" but you have to ask for it.  I told her I *did* ask for it and she just shrugged. No Splenda. What restaurant doesn't have Splenda these days? I asked and was told ""Yeah we get asked all the time, but it is too expensive."" Shrug. Really? Ordered a steak but only got gristle. I couldn't finish it. No bread comes with the meal, BTW. The veggies were OK. I asked for melted butter, but got a cup of what looked like cottage cheese. At this point, I was afraid that they were spitting in my food, so I just paid and left. Look at all the one-star reviews. Why would anyone risk this kind of experience?

Only 360 calories if you can believe it! My hubby had the grilled onion sirloin and he said they cooked it perfectly, another hard trick.

Melissa H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",37,94,8,3.0,10/13/2014,"I wouldn't usually review a chain restaurant because you pretty much should know what to expect and what type of food and service you will receive but I had a really weird experience with our bartender Saturday night. We came in at 10:45, this is an hour and 15 minutes before they close. We opted to sit at the bar and the bartender could not make it anymore obvious that she was really irritated with anybody who dared show up and order something. I understand she may have been having a bad day and being a bartender is not an easy job but you have to be a little less obvious because it's not the customer's fault that you hate your job or things are a little rough. I've worked in food service and been there before, exhausted and working at a fast food restaurant at 2AM and rushing to get everything done and cleaned so I could just go home but I never treated my customers crappy as much as my job sucked. Don't treat your customer like a huge inconvenience because your customers are your wage and tip. What felt the most awkward to me was being treated as if I had come in 10 minutes before closing (we came in over an hour before closing!). I can understand why bartenders and waitresses would feel overwhelmed with having customers arrive 10 minutes before closing and expecting to have 5 star service when the employees just want to get everything done to go home on time.  To the manager, your bartender needs a little more coaching on good customer service. To the bartender, I understand you were probably tired and it was a rough day but don't make me feel like I'm a huge hassle simply because I showed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=20

Took avenges some of their creative drinks, enjoyed the Company, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the most inexpensive piece of beef I've ever ordered in a restaurant. Sadly, as soon as additional arrived I realize that it was not a deal but tit for tat. Probably the smallest piece of fillet that I have ever seen, with out any substantial sauce. But I thought hey for this price I'll give it a shot that's alright. But after my first bye I realized it would be my last visit to Applebee's... For food anyways. Dry and surprisingly flavorless.

Our food was disgusting. It was actually inedible, probably the worse restaurant food I've ever had. I ordered their four cheese Mac n cheese with honey barbecue chicken tenders on top. The pasta was very overcooked and mushy, the sauce didn't taste even slightly cheesy and was just kind of slimy and the chicken was over cooked and tasted like it was just coated in honey. My son wouldn't even eat the kiddie Mac n cheese I got for him, and my husband's meal was just as disappointing. He tried to eat as much as he could but left about half his plate, and I left almost a full plate because of how horrible it was.

Cue Rohnert Park Applebees on a random Monday morning.  We just became a table of 5 that I would never want to have back in the day when I used to serve tables.  Baby in a high chair throwing cereal.  (Although he IS cute!).  Kids meals.  Demanding tables next to us wondering where their server is so that they can change their order after they already ordered.  Ridiculously demanding customers who don't realize that... ...This place is pretty good for what it is.  Actually, an amazing value.  I ended up getting a new item, the Sizzling Chicken Fajitas, which the quality far outpaced ""fajitas"" that are currently being served at places like Baja Fresh...which I used to love.  The Sister-In-Law had a Bacon Cheeseburger with perfect fries on the side which I couldn't help but keep stealing.  The kids had meals which satisfied them, (the one in the ""in between age"" got the Pulled-Pork-Sliders off the regular menu and was stuffed!).  The niece and nephew got some chocolate shooters for dessert which were only about $1.99 and made them extremely happy.  The total lunch bill for 5 of us was about $45...which is honestly a joke considering my history in San Francisco Bay Area Restaurants (many of them with far snobbier prices, obviously!) All the while we trashed the place (mostly the fault of our 10-month old...at least we can pass the blame on him...)...and the servers were smiling.  The hostess and the staff were ""cooing"" over the baby.  We felt at home.  Like it or not, this place had suddenly become a new part of my life.  And I actually can tell you that I like it!

The minute you enter the restaurant you are not welcomed by their greeter, If anything I found her less interested in doing her job and more focused on her phone. I don't mind if you text, if you can. at work, she obviously is not capable of multi tasking. Her rudeness is throughout any interaction she is forced to have with you.

She greeted us with the scribed none inventive greeting to only then rush away without even waiting for an answer. A machine would have more heart. If she hadn't proved at that first moment she didn't want to spend more time than necessary at your table she then asked if she could bring all the food at once. Then she brought the wrong order, offered me a menu so I could pick another dish out, dropped the menu and left without waiting. Mind you my friends food was in front of them. I sat and watched them eat their entire meal and had to call her back. She asked if I wanted to place another order. I WAS IN SHOCK!

Serve me prepackaged frozen meal, this I expect, the attitude that rains supreme in the Rohnert Park Applebee's must be a reflection of poor management, lack of supervision or poor hiring either way if you want me to spend my money give me the experience. I would rather go to Mac Donald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=60
Ben S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,2.0,2/14/2010,"This applebees blows. I went here for some time until it began to go down hill about 2 years ago. Now this place is just a joke. I was dragged here today because sone friends from out of town wanted ti go. The service was fine, nothing extraordinary, but what to be expected at a casual dining place. Then the food came. I had a burger that was well done instead of medium as requested. It had 1 piece of see-through lettuce, one slice of tomato and three slivers of onion. My pickles were hidden under my fries. This brings me to my next point; the fries. I got 8 fries. That's right, 8. I counted. I looked around the table and saw generally the same thing with the rest of the orders. I paid $10 for this crap. Do yourself a favor and visit chilis a couple of miles down the road, it's totally worth the money AND they include dessert in their 2 for $20. I hope the owners read this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=60
Angela Y.,"Fremont, CA",36,253,22,2.0,12/22/2007,"I would say for an Applebee's, this location is above average. Our waiter was nice. We got a table fairly quickly for a Friday night. The food is average. They have a new menu and it is pretty much dumbed down to the basics. There are not many selections. The pasta was flavorless and overcooked. The burgers were average, but the fries are good. The drink menu was very limited, but they do have a bar.  This Applebee's did its job and got us in &out fairly quickly without any complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=60

Adam W.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/10/2013,"Very pleased with my visit, the food was quick, and good. The manager stopped by the table to make sure we were doing fine, he recommended some dishes. The baby back ribs were great, and the chicken pasta was very good too. I eat at expensive restaurants in the city plenty, and the pasta compared to many of them. I ordered a shot, and it was filed to the brim, unfortunately we missed happy hour! People are to harsh, there is plenty of bad food establishments in Rohnert Park, this isn't one of them. Waitresses were fine too, in reading some previous reviews I read about poor service from the staff, however one must remember they are in a college town, and kids serving adults seems to work about as good as it sounds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rohnert-park-2?start=60
