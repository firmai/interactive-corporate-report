In a nut shell, the food and service is good enough to come back for.  The draft beer is what makes me keep on driving to the next restaurant.  Sorry guys, I've been telling you for forever and I guess my complaints have never made it past the bartenders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

I also ordered a type of martini it was small full of ice and cost 11$.

20,Nicholas W.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,8,,1.0,2014-06-17,"This is the worst TGI Fridays I have ever been to. The employees are too busy gossiping and probably on their phones to attentively serve you. My brother and I are members of their Stripes member club, and were not made aware that you receive free chips and salsa with every meal before we went to a different Friday's location. The managers here are as bad as the kid employees, and they never come to the table to check if things are adequate. If, and when, they give you old food or a wrong order they give you attitude when you ask for a different plate. Finally, the staff will get angry with you if they fail to ask recognize or ask you if you will be getting separate checks, especially since it seems to be such an enormous problem for them to ring up two credit cards or use a combination of cash and credit.  Overall as a company, they offer you coupons through their rewards programs but  don't allow you to use them in conjunction with their happy hour or the deals they have on their menus, so what's the point? Although, this may be one of the many inconsistencies we find with this location as well. Like how different waiters and managers allow you to finagle menu items in ways that seem totally logical (cheaper appetizers with the more expensive entree deals instead of the more expensive appetizers) while others will tell you they don't do that.  Overall, Fridays has good food and seems like an okay business as a whole, but this location seriously disappoints and is overall rude most of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

And when I asked to substitute with something that was of equal value, the waitress was told by the manager to ""just say you're really sorry but you can't change anything"". Well that's lovely. The food was ok. Nothing amazeballs.

33,Chris M.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2014-12-06,Not the best TGI Fridays experience. Had 6 greeters up front that all failed the job. Appetizers were not cooked enough when served. Main course tasted like it was cooked twice. Spinach looked like someone picked it out of the trash and put in a bowl. Tap beer comments on here ARE 100% ACCURATE! Beer tasted like it was poured through an old sock first. Otherwise a great experience.

What I got was colossal pieces of Romain lettuce drowning in blue cheese and half a boiled egg. Oh and by the way maybe a tablespoon of dressing.

Service was the worst we had ever had. Appetizer took over twenty minutes to come out, asked server for silver ware and waters.. Which she forgot twice. Steak came out well done, asked for medium rare. Saw the server 15 minutes after food came out and demanded it come off our bill .. Knew kitchen would have put a rush on it but quite clearly was worried the server would forget about it like she did everything else that night.

They have everyday drink specials. We went for their $10 Endless Apps and it's not worth it unless you're starving and can get the same dish numerous times. We got the Sriracha Chicken Potato Skins. They were okay. I actually enjoyed my $4 wedge salad more. Also, the server should've asked if we wanted another app when we were finished with the first one. Instead we had to flag her down to order, and then it took awhile... so by the time the second app came out, we were full and ready to leave. But the server we had that night was good. She was awesome and even gave us a take out box for the app we didn't finish. I'd rather go to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville,,,,,

Always on their phones and barely checking in with you. Last time I was there our server walked by my empty water and beer 4 times without asking if I wanted a refill.

21,Mike H.,"Brooklawn, NJ",3,18,2.0,1.0,2015-12-25,"Absolutely Horrible! My family and I go to TGI Fridays every year on Christmas for dinner. We usually go to the one in Cherry Hill but we were running kind of late and decided to go to the Turnersville one instead. BIG MISTAKE! The food came and my mom's mashed potatoes were cold, and my sizzling chicken and cheese skillet was so hot that it burned the cheese black and smelled like burned food. My mom asked for some hot mashed potatoes and waited about 10 mins and then someone brought an order of fries. 5 mins later someone else brought an order of steak fries (we didn't ask for neither). When the waitress brought the steak fries we told her we were waiting on mashed potatoes. They finally came when the meal was done. The manager came over to apologize and wanted to make sure all else was ok and I showed him my burned cheese and he apologized and asked if I wanted another one and I declined because our meal was over and the kids were getting rambunctious. The manager came back 5 mins later and gave me a single chicken breast to go. The waiter dropped off the check which was incorrect (charged us for extra mozzarella sticks) and nothing was taken off the bill at all. We told the waiter and he said he would take it off and be right back. We waited and waited and seen him delivering food to other tables but still didn't dropped off the check. After a bit he came back and asked if there was anything else he could do and we said ""yes, the check please?"" Had to wait another 5 mins for the check. I can say that I will never go back there again. Oh and the endless apps advertisement is a bit misleading, unlimited appetizer for $10.99, but that is PER PERSON...CRAZY",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20,,,,,
28,Christine F.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2016-01-05,"Went in today for lunch and it was a terrible experience. Our waiter Mike was extremely pleasant and good at his job. I feel bad for Mike because the rest of the staff was so awful. The other waitresses and manager were so miserable they actually made us feel uncomfortable. These women appear to hate their job and offer terrible service. My husband hit his limit when rather than say ""excuse me"" , a bitch faced waitress rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my daughter's highchair. On our way out the restaurant, the manager and 2 waitresses were obviously interrupted and annoyed by my husband walking past them. Not one of them said a single word to him, such as ""thank you"" or ""have a good day"". Nor did they moved from their spot to allow him a clear path to carry the baby past in her car seat. The youngest of the 3 women did however have a minute to glare at him and my daughter until she saw me approaching and put her head down, rather than say day good day or attempt to be polite. Complaining to management would be of little use as it seems the manager was very much a part of the miserable atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20,,,,,
