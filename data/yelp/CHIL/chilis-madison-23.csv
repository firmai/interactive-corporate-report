Ari W.,"Madison, WI",53,156,139,4.0,12/16/2017,"Hadn't been to a Chili's in years before tonight. Came with a group tonight for a friend's birthday. Overall, it was a great time!  It was crazy busy inside. Lots of people waiting for tables but we had made a reservation. There were 12 of us at out table and we had one server - Ron.  Ron was awesome! He was running his tail off keeping us taken care of as well as his several other tables.  The food and drinks were all pretty darn good. The Tito's punch was fantastic! Dangerously delicious. The street corn was awesome. The chicken and avocado tacos were perfectly sized and definitely hit the spot.  Ron brought us two lava cake desserts to share amongst the table with birthday candles which was the perfect end to the meal.  Overall, it was a good experience and I think our server was fantastic. Kudos to Ron. Thanks for dealing with our large, multi-check, rambunctious group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Tenny D.,"Madison, WI",6,97,165,3.0,2/23/2017,"This is my first visit. To be true, I didn't go with much expectation. This was the closest place to where we were and the weather wasn't as good to explore.  We ordered tortilla Chips with salsa and guacamole to begin with. That was actually a good one. They gave us fresh chips and the salsa which was pretty mild and the guacamole was well made as well.  I ordered a mango chille tilapia which was too much on the sweet side. The topping was mango salsa with avocado (which was turning almost black). We also ordered a half rack ribs and a side of steamed broccoli (which was over steamed and mushy). The ribs were average- not out of the ordinary.  Our server was very attentive and often came by the table to ask how we were doing. I am giving an extra star just for him.  Food wise.. I won't come back again. I think they are much better places in Madison to try the same kinda food they serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Rosa S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,Went to Chili's for lunch with friends and our service was awful. Our server didn't introduce himself so we had no idea what his name was. He came over one time to get our drink order and then never came back. After waiting 20 minutes we got up and left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Chy R.,"Madison, WI",957,474,1492,4.0,1/27/2016,"Okay, before you write me off or send an angry mob with pitchforks to chase me off of yelp, remember this review is solely based on MY experience with the food 'I' ordered.  First, I groaned at the suggestion of eating at the lower-tiered chain. Sadly their reputation proceeded them. However, my disdain quickly vanished. I ordered the Grilled Fish Tacos: 3 tacos with grilled chile-lime tilapia topped with house-made cilantro slaw, pico de gallo, sliced avocado, chopped cilantro & queso fresco wrapped. Substituted the rice and beans with a side fresco salad and quinoa and wheatberry salad. When I opened my box, I was surprised to see how fresh and colorful everything appeared. The side salad was a nice mix of baby greens. The lime vinaigrette that came with the salad was refreshingly and light. Not overly oily at all. The Quinoa and wheatberry salad arrived warm. It had delightful balance of diced red peppers and sauteed onions that dressed up super-grains, and gave it a flavorful zest. The fish tacos were amazing! They softly sat atop of what appeared to be wheat flour tortillas on a bed of fresh shredded cabbage - not coleslaw (this is very important to note, as there have been other offenders), drizzeled with pica de gallo and piled with generous slabs of ripe green avocados. The sauce was hiding underneath.  Visually, this was not what I expected out of Chili's. Slapped on a colorful bold platter, and could have passed in any other established Mexican restaurant. They were so tasty! The tilapia was well seasoned and brought out the entire flavor of the tacos, complimenting the otherwise unadventurous cabbage. It tasted fresh, not a hint of fishyness at all.  Another thing I love about Chili's, sure some people may associate it as junk food or think of high sodium-inducing coma, but you can customize the meal to as healthy or as unhealthy as you want it to be. For example, you can go with the Bacon Ranch Beef Quesadillas, topping at a whopping 1,800 calories with a sides of Mac and Cheese, which are an additional 490 calories. Or instead, you can choose the Fish Tacos (820 calories for all three!) with a Quinoa and wheatberry blend (a mere 130 calories), and still have enough room - calorically speaking - left for dessert, and not feel guilty about it. I'm just so thrilled I was able to have a great meal at Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Brittany B.,"Linden Park, Verona, WI",61,7,2,3.0,9/10/2017,"Can be a bit slow depending on when you go. Food is hit or miss and wait staff is,also hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Desiree B.,"Austin, TX",22,17,4,4.0,6/22/2017,I love love love my french onion soup. I sent it back to be remade and the waitress made sure it came out with more broth and a timely manner. We were a table of five. They accommodated us since booths were unavailable. Would def come again. She was friendly with our children as well. Wait for food could have been better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Joseph F.,"Spring Grove, IL",0,10,,1.0,3/24/2017,This has to be the worst chilis I have ever been to. This is the second time they forgot something on my pick up order. And both times it happened to be the side I paid extra for. On top of that they gave my the wrong sauce for my chicken. I will never be going back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Stephanie A.,"Fort Wayne, IN",30,5,,2.0,7/11/2017,"I ordered carry out fajitas from them over a month ago. They put meat and fajita veggies in a box and forgot the rest of the ingredients. I called and spoke to a manager who got my address and apologized, promising to send me a gift card which NEVER ARRIVED.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Laura R.,"Middleton, WI",2,24,14,3.0,2/3/2017,"This place is getting even better! I still wish there were more vegetarian options, especially vegetarian soup. Even though I don't eat meat the burgers looked so good! My friend had an avocado burger and my mouth watered looking at it. I did find a winner in the Margherita Flatbread Salad. Wow was that amazing. It was only 6.99 + 1.00 extra for quinoa. So many natural zesty flavors. Super filling. I was very surprised to find something so delicious and natural at Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Ms W.,"Rock Hill, SC",0,7,,1.0,3/12/2017,They are a single franchise and therefore not connected to any of the normal Chili reward programs.  I however didn't find that out until after I had ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Erica O.,"Madison, WI",29,5,1,2.0,3/24/2017,"I enjoy the food at chili's, but service is usually slow. Anywho, my husband and I were hungry late one friday night, and it was 10:40 when I called to place a to go order (they close at 11) and they responded by saying ""uhh we close at 11"". I considered responding to that but then just said nope this isn't worth my time. This is their loss turning business away, as I decided to order from Cheesecake Factory instead (my employer).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
O A.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,38,17,4.0,1/27/2016,"Had a great dinner: baby back ribs (always great), fajitas (sizzling good), & fish tacos (family favorite). Nate was an attentive & kind server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Gemma B.,"Fitchburg, WI",48,63,23,1.0,9/7/2014,"Seriously, don't come to this location.  We actually really enjoy the food, but have yet to receive anything close to acceptable service.  Tonight we came in, as we had vouchers from our last visit. Our last visit was the single most  offensive dining experience I've ever had. The waiter was racist, and told us how he gives up any tables that might be Hispanic, because, and I'm quoting here, ""I don't speak Mexican, and it's too confusing."" Like, seriously? Then he continued on with the racism train and did a ridiculously stereotypical Asian accent. Like South Park bad. I told management and was given a voucher. Ok, fine second chance time. Tonight was not much better. True there was no racism, thankfully, but that waiter is still employed. So that's cool. Good to know that Chili's supports racist assholes. Service was pretty awful. Appetizer came out after the food, a personal pet peeve of mine, and that's about when our server dropped off the face of the earth. Finally found out he was out back smoking. He could have at least brought us the beverages he promised 5 minutes before he disappeared before vanishing for an extra 20. Finally got another server, who seemed awesome, to bring us our beverages. So thanks random waiter for being better than anyone who's actually served us there. Will not be returning to this location a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Gregg B.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,12,2,1.0,8/27/2016,"What a disappointment!! The service was great but the Santa Fe Chicken salad dressing was way too spicy, our mouths were on fire. What is the staffs problem, we had been to Chili's before at other locations and had a wonderful experience, very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Stephen F.,"Madison, WI",99,6,1,1.0,7/1/2014,"My family and I were seated immediately, but that was the only timely thing that happened. After seating us and being greeted by the waiter, fifteen minutes went by before we saw him again to order our drinks. The entire night the service was terrible; the waiter only stopping by to drop off our drinks and food. Our dinner took an additional thirty minutes after the drinks came. We got our appetizer after dinner (still paid for it though). One of my friends was seated near us, after we arrived, but got their food and finished it before we even got ours. With no apologies or explanations, I'm left thinking this is the norm and have no desire to go back to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Grant M.,"Madison, WI",0,2,,1.0,1/19/2015,"They make you pay extra for ordering food from the computer but they tell you that's what you have to do, it's also really dirty on the inside, the food is also not that good and the service is really bad and your not even sure if your spoce to use them",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23

Taylor G.,"Des Moines, IA",0,10,1,1.0,5/4/2014,"Went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. Another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. Our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating them. Our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... We refused to pay that was not our mistake. The waitress then asked us 3 different times how we are going to pay for 8 of us. We asked every time to please separate the bills. She not only rolled her eyes, but she said ""okay then..."" in a rude tone. I would not go back to this particular location.  We also had to asked 3 times for waters and the drinks that we ordered. Finally the manager came over to help.  The only thing that evened out the trip was the fact the food was actually good....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Angie L.,"Austin, TX",690,363,1205,3.0,8/3/2011,"I am normally not a big fan of chain locations like this. I came here based on my friends votes.

Anne G.,"Madison, WI",3,57,,3.0,8/9/2015,"I would never say, ""Hey, let's eat at Chili's tonight!"" It's really not my cup of tea. However, props to the company for the thorough allergen menu(s). We stopped by for lunch on a Sunday and were able to confidently get our 10 y/o a bacon cheeseburger and fries with no worries. Service was attentive and friendly. Utensils were spotty and some pieces a bit dirty, like they'd been overloaded in the dishwasher. While the kid downed his burger, we had salads ... that each cost more than the burger. Overpriced little chicken salads! :) Will we be back? In a pinch, sure. But for chain restaurants with allergen menus, I prefer Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23
Curt S.,"Cross Plains, WI",114,32,1,3.0,6/7/2014,"My wife and I go here pretty regularly.

Mark R.,"Albany, WI",23,220,228,4.0,1/22/2012,"Chili's....it is what it is, and my review reflects this.... We typically come here at least 3 or 4 times a year, at least one time being for a birthday party and ribs.  They have ALWAYS treated us well, the food is decent, service is friendly, the the Chili's experience is perfect for a fun, bit loud, and silly birthday party.  The staff are fun, and oh-so-patient.  Hint...free brownie-ice cream treat on birthdays and with movie ticket stubs.  DANGER...sweet but, hard to resist. The other times we're here it's for lunch during errands.  We usually sit at a hi-top in the bar to avoid the wait.  The waits can be long during peak periods but, they handle them well.  It's a fun place to watch games, good visibility of televisions in the bar and they're really nice about switching channels.  I've always had decent service here, too. The food...the food is Chili's.  It's not fine dining, and not meant to be.  It's a hell of a lot better than Perkins or Red Robin.  They do a nice Tex-Mex/American blend menu, with a lot of good healthy choice options.  They're also not afraid to do tangy, hot, and flavorful.  If you can't find something you like on the huge menu, you're just too darn picky and don't go out to eat with me. My only complaint is the place can be dirty.  To be fair, that's a bit inevitable with such a popular and busy location.  The staff do run around cleaning and are attentive but, on more than one occasion, I've had a dirty booth or table.  So, for that, 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give them 4.5 if it was an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20
Peter W.,"Sykesville, MD",24,4,,1.0,4/13/2013,"Well that was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. We asked to have our son's food first so we could feed our 1 yr old and everything came out at once in under 5 minutes. The food was sub par at best, the ""crispy chicken"" was more soggy then my pasta and half of her dish was ice cold and the corn on the cob was raw.  And my dish was better served out of a buffet. It might not have been so dry and tasteless if the food was not cooked this morning . My wife's drink originally came with something floating in it. Even though it was a Saturday evening it was still early, we saw the bus boy at our table more often than our waiter. It has been some time since our last visit to a Chili's and the only reason we went there tonight was because we had a gift card. I think it will be some time before we'll feel brave enough to try them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20

Blaize N.,"Madison, WI",14,39,1,2.0,12/24/2009,"Not offensively bad, but there are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time on a mediocre at best chain like Chili's. Better restaurants on the West Side. Heck, better restaurants at the same mall: If you're considering Chili's, go to Granite City instead. It's also unforgivable (well, almost...I'll expand on this when I review the Dane) to be a bar and grill with lousy fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20

Timothy S.,"Madison, WI",15,446,,3.0,12/2/2011,"I have had some good food here but a few years back they went downhill in quality especially noticeable in their burgers.   So I pointed it out to management and they gave me some bs about how I must have just hit a bad day or something and no apology or compensation for a disappointing meal.    Anyway, I haven't been back in years but recently stopped in for a burger and the menu was changed and the burger I ordered was enormous and quite good.  Not sure yet about the other burgers but it looks like they have corrected some things.   Service was a little slow but ok.   Food took a little while but finally arrived after say 15 min?   I'd rather wait 15 for properly prepared food than get something quick and not properly prepared.  Everything was super hot.  Yum! They have some techno gadget on the table that serves as a sort of menu/gamebox/call for order thing.  I just pushed it aside.   Does anyone know what this is all about?  I thought it was kind of weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20
Malcolm K.,"Madison, WI",2,13,,3.0,3/10/2012,"On the night we ate they ended up seating us in an area that seemed to double as an employee lounge. They had waitresses counting out tips, setting silverware, being loud having personal conversations etc.. If it was just a minute or two I wouldn't have said anything, but since it was getting later in the evening it just wound up getting worse. I would have given a two star except the food and drinks were pretty good and the manager gave us a free desert and moved us to the bar when brought to his attention. The only reason I will be going back is because the manager handled the situation perfectly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20

Maria F.,"Madison, WI",0,6,,4.0,7/24/2012,"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Chili's really wins me over. Everything on the menu tastes good. EVERYTHING.  My personal favorites are; Wings over buffalo, southwestern eggrolls, nachos, big mouth bites, and the MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE. MMM it is so good you need to get it if you go there, ok? You absolutely need to.  Anyhoo, the menu is very reasonably priced. Whenever I go here on lunch dates with my friends, we love to split their appetizers to eat as our entree's, because for the pricing they are rather generous. For example; we will order the queso as an appetizer and then the appetizer Big mouth bites and split that for our entree. Sometimes we will even get dessert! And the bill is 18.00 (if we get water). So, 8 bucks a person for delicious queso with homemade chips, 2 mini burgers that are to die for with friends, and half of a chocolate explosion? Sounds like a good deal to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-madison-23?start=20
