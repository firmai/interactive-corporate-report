She loved the veggie tacos when they were on the menu, but they disappeared the next time we went, and the quesadillas were not quite as good.

Chili's has definitely made some improvements since the nineties, but I still wouldn't call it a fave.  Some things that are pretty decent include the skillet queso, the fire grilled corn guacamole and salsa (and all you can eat chips!), the fajitas (the trio isn't bad but steak is my favorite), and the margaritas.  Seriously, I ONLY come here for these things.     Everything else is just alright.  Alright service, alright atmosphere, alright food, alright bar menu (NOT including beer.  None of their beer is good.  Beer snobs beware!).  Overall, I like coming here for a change in the restaurant rotation, but I'm not planning on becoming a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

Came recently which is what I'll base this review off of. First I noticed that the booths, floors, and atmosphere are getting outdated and old. Maybe it's time for an remodel? I only say that because the booth I was sitting at moved every time the person behind me moved, and that was some teenage girl who wouldn't sit still. Pretty annoying. I just sucked it up and didn't complain about it. Another small thing that bugged me was that iced tea was the same price as a soft drink. But that's not really their fault, just Chili's in general I suppose. Did the 2 for 20 with my mom which I think is a great deal, so props there. I got the Margarita grilled chicken and my mom got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas and we got the chipotle chicken flatbread app. I'm trying out a diet, don't judge me. I used to always get the baby back ribs which are delicious and I miss so much.... But anyway the chicken was pretty good. Good flavors with the tomatoes mixed in and then also adding the crunch with the tortilla strips. Didn't care for the beans, it looked like soup. Quesidillas were good but that is what it is pretty much, nothing special. My dad got the chicken fajitas which were pretty good, but again that's pretty straight up, just give someone all the ingredients and let them make their own fajita.

Maybe because they were so busy or because it was late (dinner rush) whatever the case I was extremely disappointed and didn't even finish my meal.

But then when I put the fork into it again they were like on the fork but a string still to the plate.. uummm yeah I don't think potatoes should do that. So, I decided to just throw them away.

Ordered two chipotles chicken salads with soups and two buffalo chicken sandwiches. Both sandwiches were completely wrong.  We ordered one to have blue cheese and the other ranch, cheddar cheese on both, both no tomatoes, one no lettuce.  Even though this order was placed online they managed to get it wrong.  Both sandwiches got blue cheese one should have had ranch, no cheese on one the other got American instead of cheddar. No lettuce on both (one should have had).  Attention to detail is not taken seriously at this location. Ample time was given to prep the order. It was placed via   using options that chilis deemed understandable by its employees. So I expect it to be made correctly. I am a very easy going person when it comes to food but when the order is placed online I don't understand how someone can get it wrong still. There is no possible way that there was a misunderstanding like there would be if I was placing a phone order that I could understand maybe I said something wrong but this was clear as day.

However, two pieces had a bizarre plastic taste (the others were fine). - Honey mustard: Good... But there wasn't nearly enough! I ate the first two pieces plain/in the car sans sauce. So the amount of sauce they gave me didn't even cover 3 pieces of chicken! Skimpy sauce is disappointing.

On to the ribs, sauce was good but ribs were barely warm.  There was barely any meat on the ribs..  Not joking...many bites were just sauce on bone.  Leads me to believe they cooked these days before and the second heating just melted away any of the meat and fat were left.  Also, in looking at the rib bones was that freezer burn i saw?....all the white spots on the bones.  I stopped after 2 ribs and then just sopped up the sauce with the fries. The fries were hot and delish.  The beer was good.  One star for each of those.  Was seated quickly and plenty of parking that day. Waitress was friendly enough.

I was even invited to come back again for a free dinner. The food was excellent with generous portion. I'm avoiding TGIF in the future for this unnecessary stinginess, and will now happily become a regular Chili's customer. The Chili's manager on duty, by the way, was extremely nice and most welcoming of veterans, offering his thanks for our service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
8,Chris E.,"Glendale Heights, IL",60,80,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Usually have good service but today was as bad as I have seen in a long time.  Very slow, waiter did not know how to discount the 2 for $22 promo and took 10 minutes to bring out the chips and salsa on a very slow night.  The drinks had to be requested multiple times for refills.  My ribs were luke warm at best he offered to have them regrilled but I was starving by this time.  The 2 for 22 meal was fine.  Portion size was fine.  Waiter was then shoving all of the table scraps into the middle of the floor and left it there before coming back to sweep it up and them left that broom on the chair behind me.  Normally we are in and out within an hour to and hour and fifteen minutes but today it was almost 2 hours.  Another waitress had to correct our bill and help us with applying the discount code from our phone for the dessert.  Did not see the manager for at least the first hour or hour and fifteen minutes but he never asked any tables how things were and when we left he was in the bar area watching the hockey game.  Last time when i had an issue with being charged $1 more for the grilled corn when I did not want that but it came with my meal it was rectified and he stopped by the table 2-3 times...this time no communication.  At least the bathrooms were clean and stocked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
