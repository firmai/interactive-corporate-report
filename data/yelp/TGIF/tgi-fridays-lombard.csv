Megan M.,"Elmhurst, IL",9,35,5,5.0,2/6/2008,"mmmmm I love this place. I order chicken fingers with fries, honey mustard sauce, and their cheddar broccoli soup is so so good. I also like their sesame jack chicken strips and their brownie obsession is excellent. The only thing... I sometimes get sick when I eat here.

Gina Granby G.,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,6/9/2014,"Worse experience!  This location has been going down in both service and food quality.  Last night might have just been the straw that broke the camels back!! We are going out for a family dinner, which for us is 7 people and 1 friend came along.  I sent our oldest kids (who are in their 20's) to get the table and we were a few minutes behind. When we walked in the girls are the only ones in the front of the restaurant and the had a pager in hand,  but there where several open tables!!! The hostess was very rude to them and myself stating ""they don't have anything available""!     - Please note is was at 7:20pm - We are sat at the table and drink orders were taken, all drinks come but 1 we reminded the server that we are still missing 1 lemonade and she said it would be right out, 5 minutes later the drink arrives.   we order (1) app & (2) come with the 2 for 10 so we had a total of 3 coming.  Again the waiting game began...Once the server returned we needed refills and asked what the delay was, she said I'm sorry the Kitchen is REALLY, REALLY SLOW RIGHT NOW, WE JUST WERE SLAMMED. Ok but they were not slammed now... apps come out and they also bring out my dinner which was a salad.  Guess what no sooner did the apps get there....here comes the meals!!!! All but 1 again (just like the drinks) it was a major dish to NOT!!! ...a wedge salad. so again we wait and wait and then the server returns...  - Please note now it is 8:30pm -  Still waiting for wedge salad !! FINALLY IT ARRIVES - I ask to see the manager on duty.  Server states he will be right out.... and again we wait.... now mind you the restaurant is now pretty dead.  5 minutes go by and the manager who comes to the table is laughing and grinning at me like we are nuts....  Really doesn't seem to take anything serious.  I said PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS WAS TERRIBLE... THE FOOD WAS DRY AND OVER COOKED...And we do NOT want any free desserts because I are not waiting for them!!!! - please note now 8:55 pm -  Manager says I'll give you 20% off your bill too the WHOLE 3.00 OFF for the wedge salad... an card for free app, which he had a stack of in his pocket!   So, after we got our check .... and paid the still 79.00 bill after discounted 20%  we are walking out at 9:15!!!!! SIDE NOTE: (Which I also mentioned to the manager) WORSE OF ALL !!!! No toliet paper in bathroom / soap dispenser laying in sink / Roll of paper roll on the ground --- GROSS !!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=60

I ordered the spinach dip, sizzling chicken mexicali and a chocolate peanut butter cheese cake.  I was stuffed and very satisfied. Now the BAD: -- Food was way too hot when served, literally taken JUST off the grill.  I a burned my tongue/mouth. -- The deal breaker : absolutely terrible service! Our waiter wasn't slow, he was non-existent.  He came by to get our orders, then quickly performed a Houdini disappearing act and was never to be seen again.  EVERY single time our table needed something we had to flag down another waiter.   I seriously wished i could just give a cash tip to the other waitress, she was working hard for us.  Some folks at our table were considering a no-tip punishment... but i was able to coax them into giving a minimum 10%.  We didn't have the time to ask for a manager and complain, we just wanted to get out of there.

Greg F.,"Westchester, IL",3,8,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Hadn't been here in over 8 years, but decided to try it again since a recent experience at the location in Downers Grove on 75th was very good.  Boy, what a mistake.  Hard to understand how you can have vastly different experiences between the two.  First, we got stuck at a round table for 6 when I had a party of 4, and the table was very wobbly.  Got the Warm Pretzels with the Craft Beer Cheese sauce and it was somehow both hot and cold...and clumpy.  Wife got the Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi, well, at least that is what she ordered.  She got chicken instead, and when she questioned what she was served, our Server had the audacity to tell us that a lot of customers get confused between the chicken and the mahi mahi.  Sorry, nice try, but we know the difference between chicken and fish.  We didn't want to wait for them to correct their mistake so we kept it, but thought we'd get a discount or perhaps have it removed from the check.  Nope.  No such luck.  Was also told that the chicken and the mahi mahi were the same price.  Seems a bit surprising.  One of the menus had food debris, and it appeared that one of the place settings (silverware wrapped in napkin) and a small bit of blood stain on it.  I got the Sizzling Chicken and Spinach, which was okay, but the Fresh Tomato Mozzarella Salad was anything but fresh.  Tasted as bad as it looked.  The whole experience was bad all the way around.

Kara Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",115,604,227,5.0,9/4/2010,"People sometimes make fun of me because I really love Fridays. When I find a menu item I like, I go back and always order it. That's what I do with Friday's pecan crusted chicken salad. It is delicious! They used to use cold chicken on top of the salad, but now it is heated and that adds a lot to it. Over the past couple of years, each time I get it it does seem slightly different- the amount or mandarin oranges or dried cranberries changes, or the pecans are a different consistency. But I love it every time. It is a large salad so I always bring half of it home and enjoy it the next day too. We also really enjoy the green bean fries- I know, weird, but don't knock 'em till you try 'em!  I think their desserts are awesome too. My husband and I are a big fan of the chocolate brownie dessert but also the peanut butter cup pie tops Baker's Square any day!  They seem to change their menu a lot, but I'm happy that my favorites tend to stick around. We are ""givememorestripes"" members which means we earn points with every purchase. I love a deal and this is great- they send you coupons through email, also sometimes in the mail, and on your birthday you get a free dessert. We got a coupon this week for buy one entree and an appetizer and then get one entree free. Awesome. Our experience tonight was great- we were greeted at the door and then the person who brought us to our table was kind (and even seemed to read that I wasn't thrilled with a little two-person table and so was kind of apologetic, which I appreciated). Our waiter (James K) was perfect. He had perfect timing, wasn't pushy, and he knew JUST when my husband was ready for a refill on his Diet Coke. We didn't have to wait long for anything. Our food was the perfect temperature, the music wasn't too loud, and James K was attentive and laid back and funny.

Keith K.,"New Lenox, IL",1,7,,1.0,4/3/2012,"I was conned into eating at TGIF the other day due to a very opinionated co-worker's birthday and needless to say I was not looking forward to it.  Nothing has ever impressed me about these restaurants, not the food, service or clientele; needless to say my opinion was not changed after this latest venture there. Recently I was put on a budget thanks to my newborn son and money-conscious wife so I knew my choices were going to be limited and I wouldn't be able to enjoy the only meal that seemed appealing and somewhat healthy to me - the sizzling chicken and cheese.  Going with the cheapest meal on the menu might have been a blessing in disguise.  While others were opting for the aforementioned sizzling chicken and cheese (some with shrimp - yum!), dragon stomach shrimp and rice mush I decided on the Southwestern Wedge Salad.  The server shockingly mocked me with a ""That's it?"" probably due to my girth but I assured her that the salad along with my glass of off-yellow water would be sufficient. The salad came out and I was actually impressed.  All the flavors blended well together and for $4.96 I was content; which is more than I can say about my co-workers choice words for their meals.  Some claimed their chicken was rubbery, others thought the rice was over-done and the birthday girl wanted everyone to know that her dog's droppings tasted better than her shrimp - the older ladies at the table next to us absolutely loved that one.  I have yet to find her review on here for Rufus' Dog Dropping Emporium though. The service was slow for it not being all that busy in the place and I really don't want to judge people on personal hygiene or appearance but I am going to.  It really seemed like the whole wait staff was very unkempt, so much so that one person wondered aloud if they were on some kind of work release program.  Shirts were untucked or faded, crumbs were everywhere, my portion of the table was sticky and don't forget the off-yellow water I mentioned earlier.  If it had been busier I could have let this slide a little bit but these people are handling my food and this is the condition of the places I could see, I can only imagine what the kitchen looked like... actually, I don't think I want to imagine that at all. Once the bill came we realized just how overpriced this underwhelming experience was.  Two positive notes though - the server did split the check amongst the six of us so I didn't have to pay anything toward the over-priced rubber meat and boxed mashed most people got and she did bring the birthday girl a sundae unasked.  Of course the B-Day Girl was very appreciative and responded loudly with, 'I don't eat effing ice cream, anybody want this ****?'.  Stay classy you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=40

Caroline K.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,3.0,9/28/2013,"I'm a bit unsure of how to rate this place. I've been here pretty much since I was born--I used to love it so much, I came here each year for my birthday!  But now since I've grown up and that TGI Friday's has changed, so has my opinion on this restaurant. Let me start by stating that back in its glory days, the waits were out the door, the place was hopping, the food was perfect, the environment was fun, etc.  We always had nice waiters serve us and the food was delicious.  To put it simply, it was a treat for my family to dine here. After coming here last night with my boyfriend, I've finally, truly seen the difference.  While the decor has changed in appearance (obviously), so has its underlying spirit.  The food isn't quite as great as it used to be--the flavoring is ""good"" at best, but not ""great"".  However, it IS always fresh, so there's no worry about it being under/over-cooked.  Portion-wise, there's always enough food to fill you up!  For a while, the soda machine was malfunctioning, and my Coca-Colas were either flat or salty, so beware (just in case!).  The waiters are usually very nice about replacing a sour glass though, so that's good.  They also have a fair variety of dessert options which is nice. For the most part, the service has been good.  The drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, and checks come out at decent times; with the exception of last night, as our waiters changed three times, and our check came 20 minutes after we finished dessert.  The employees working there are nice and helpful, but they kind of seem like they're just there to work and that's it--not to please and serve their customers. I don't know if calling Friday's a ""hit-or-miss"" place is the right way to put it, but I'd say take a chance and enjoy it the best you can.  Visit on a day where your patience is at its best and your standards aren't at its highest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=40

Asked them what vodka they used they said a name that I've never heard of. Apparently found out that that's the cheapest vodka that's used sometimes for cooking. Don't repeat the same mistake. Then got a chocolate martini. Chunks of ice in the martini,  had bland flavor like stale chocolate. Gave beer a try. Fail. Was flat. Ordered mozzarella sticks. Inside was cold. Flatbread looked like it's been out for a while. Same with potato skins. Tasted worse than freezer kind. Seriously though nothing tasted fresh or flavorful or better yet worth my money. My last resort in the area and only cuz it's so cheap. So many tables were not bussed around us and literally stayed with dirty plates for an hour. Clearly lack of bus boys or staff in general. Service was lackluster. No water was brought with alcoholic drinks. No energy or smiles for staff. Reminded me of a dive bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=40

Because it was a little after the lunch hour, and there was a huge thunderstorm outside, the restaurant was quiet. We were seated right away and our waitress took our drink orders, which were promptly delivered to our table. I just stopped being a vegetarian (I need my meat!!!) so I went all out and order the Jack Daniels Burger. And I'm so glad I did! It was YUMMY. I don't know what's in that Jack Daniels sauce they use, but it's good. The sauce is a little on the sweet side, but perfectly compliments the large angus beef burger. The sauce also tasted great on the french fries. The burger was large and filling. They also gave me a generous helping of fries, so my stomach was very satisfied when we finished. Sadly, I was too full for dessert. My dad ordered the same Jack Daniels burger and he agreed with my about how good it was. Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but the food is good. We did have to wait a little for our food to come out after ordering, but after a burger like that, I didn't mind.

Eric E.,"North Aurora, IL",82,448,219,3.0,1/26/2015,"3 1/2 stars.   Chain restaurants generally aren't my thing but I was meeting a handful of colleagues yesterday and TGIF was chosen.  My expectations were set for dull food.   Service from the get-go was excellent.  They open the door for you, greet you and our table waitress was very accommodating with frequent visits.  On to the food.. If you can't find something on their menu chances are you don't eat food.  Seriously, they've got a pretty fat menu that's really diverse.  There is something, as they say, for everyone.   We came in for an early dinner so I'm not sure if we ate off the lunch of dinner menu.  Regardless, I had a turkey club that was very tasty, and not gummed up with a shitload of sauce and garbage.  All the ingredients were very fresh.   Chose broccoli as my side and that too was very fresh and tasty.  Had the cheesecake for desert but also had a chance to see 3-4 other deserts.  If you're going for girth on your desert you'll want to grab the cheesecake, which is vanilla bean.  It's damn good!  The other deserts were minuscule in comparison. Again, I'm not a chain restaurant fan so my chances of coming back are slim.  But I sure wouldn't hesitate stopping here.   Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20

Carrie C.,"Lombard, IL",203,14,4,1.0,7/4/2015,"Very disappointed in this location.  My family and I come here on random occasions because it is the closest to our house.  We have most of the time waited for about 15 minutes on average for a table...after the dinner rush...about 9PM...every time we visit.  Mind you there are always about 20 tables open.  Now I understand that after the rush the managers begin to ""cut the floor"", but that shouldn't stop the host(ess) from seating.  You have staff that clean and reset the tables, at least I believe you do but it's hard to tell when I see dishes stacked like a Jenga game on several tables, so why is it so hard to seat a table of 3 at 9PM?  We are almost always seated in the atrium room to the left of the bar, right behind the host station.  (I'm assuming this is where the closing server works)  Well on the night of 7/2/2015, again after 9:00pm, it took more than 2 hours to eat a meal that should have taken 45 minutes.  Elise took 10 minutes to bring our drinks from the bar, to which she forgot to ID us first and then stated ""I need to check your IDs before I can give these to you"", and then she must have forgotten to put our order in after we gave it to her because it took 20 minutes for our appetizer to be brought to our table.  Not only that, but it was incomplete...missing the beer cheese sauce for the pretzels.  Five minutes later our entrees came out!! We had to make room on the table for the food runner to place our plates down. I had shown Elise at the beginning of our visit that we had a buy-one get one free entree coupon.  When we asked for our bill she didn't apply the coupon, and not once in the meal period did she ask us if we were Stripes members.  I had to give the check back to her with my information on it, when she returned she still didn't apply the coupon even after I tried handing it to her AGAIN. I had to then give it back to her and have her apply the coupon.  I paid with a gift card and my debit card, which it took her about 10 minutes to return and she told me ""It took so long because the gift card was giving me problems."" What?? No apology?  Needless to say we arrived at 8:45pm weren't sat til 9, my check shows that the time stamp for my table is 9:06 we didn't get home until after 11 pm and we only live 4 miles away from the restaurant.  Elise needs to maybe go through some remedial training, and have a fire lit under her backside.  We will drive the extra miles to go to another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20

Timothy H.,"Chicago, IL",171,226,69,1.0,7/22/2014,"This particular TGI Friday's has probably the worst service I have ever received, and they don't care about your credit card information. I stopped in with a friend recently on a Sunday evening.  When we arrived, the hostess told us (a part of two) that it would be almost a half hour but we could sit at and order from the bar.  We did that, and looked around at SEVERAL empty tables.  Maybe it would not have been a ""half hour wait"" if the host stand paid attention to what tables were available instead of having personal conversations about everyone that walked in the door.  But I digress..... The food was pretty decent this time, which was probably the only redeeming factor about this visit.  The chicken tenders were filling, as was the cheese sticks that I had. My major major concern was when it was time to pay for the check.  As someone who's credit card information has been compromised in the past, I am extremely careful.  Too bad the staff there couldn't care less.  The bartender took my card, laid it on top of the register IN PLAIN VIEW OF ANYONE, and then proceeds to WALK OFF, not just to the other side of the bar, but to the other side of the RESTAURANT.  Meanwhile my card is sitting on top of the register, begging for someone to copy my information down. I immediately looked for a manager.  The manager, Angie, when I told her about that, initially couldn't have cared less...and her body language (and ACTUAL language) said that.  But when I told her about my card being compromised before, she changed...slightly.  She then proceeds to take my dessert off of my bill.  When someone takes something OFF your bill, the amount should DECREASE.  Instead, it INCREASED.  She overcharged me. I called the restaurant back on Tuesday and asked for the General Manager, who (surprise, surprise!) was on ""vacation"".  The fill-in manager, Abel, proceeds to write down my credit card information AGAIN (the WHOLE number this time) and promises to call me back in an hour.  He didn't. I call the restaurant again and speak with ""Reggie"", who couldn't have been a manager, because the way he spoke to me was beyond disrespectful.  Finally I told him I would go through my bank to get the funds back because it was obvious that they didn't care, and he said ""they're not going to do anything"".  Dude, you don't know me, or my bank. If you enjoy piss poor service, being spoken to as if you are a child, and enjoy being overcharged by an inept staff that could care less, go here.  As for me, they never have to worry about me again. By the way, my Bank did give me back my money.  See TGI Friday's, you know nothing, my dear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard?start=20

My friend had gone with the 3 course for $12.99, we started off with the potstickers and they were tasty and a good size. I highly enjoy the sauce they serve with it.  My Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta was a delicious blend of alfredo and a tomato sauce (if I'm not mistaken) however, the chef put a bit too much black pepper and that was what I tasted most of the time. My friend had the Crusted Parmesan Chicken that comes with three cheese tortellini and salad. She enjoyed the chicken, but said the tortellinis were dry.

James R.,"Villa Park, IL",0,43,,3.0,11/12/2016,"My wife and I have both enjoyed eating here, but was disappointed to receive an email from Friday's with a coupon but stating ""Lombard closing 11/13, but the fun continues at Darien and Aurora"". The other locations are much too far with too many good restaurants nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard
Michelle H.,"Bolingbrook, IL",353,711,24,4.0,5/11/2015,"What can I say?  I absolutely adore their baked French onion soup, and when the craving hits, it cannot be denied.  This just happened to be conveniently close at the moment after shopping at Yorktown Mall across the street. This is the largest Friday's I have ever been in,  A large square bar is sunken into the middle of the very large dining area surrounding it.  I really dig the giant Harlequin-inspired stained glass fixture spanning the length of the bar.  Our service in the dining area was prompt, if not a little wooden.   Of course, I got my soup, but I decided to be fancy for a change.  Granted, ordering steak and lobster at a chain restaurant may not be the best of ideas, but they pulled it off quite nicely.  My sirloin was cooked to the specified rare, but I could have lived without the buttery topping that was melted on it.  The lobster was grilled, had a slightly sweet taste, served with lemon and drawn butter.  For sides, I had the jasmine rice pilaf and the steamed broccoli.  The rice needed salt, pepper and butter, as did the broccoli, which would have been better off served without the very tough stalks attached. No, it was not an earth shaking good meal, but not to shabby for a steak in a pinch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard

Seth H.,"Kenosha, WI",19,17,,1.0,5/25/2015,Do you like being forced to sit next to the bar even though the restaurant is empty?  Do you enjoy watching the 10th inning of a baseball game unfold on your phone because they don't have the MLB package? Is the perfect way to cap off a meal to wait 20 minutes to get the check? Go here. You'll love it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard
Vladimir K.,"Palatine, IL",0,11,1,1.0,4/24/2016,"I stopped by here once while I was visiting one of my clients. The first impression wasn't bad. This restaurant is clean and well taken care of. There is no wifi service which is no big deal to most but when you're trying to work and have a business meeting, no connectivity could be an annoyance and a huge inconvenience. I ordered a mushroom burger and asked for them to add an egg and bacon to my burger. The food came out after about 30 minutes although the place wasn't busy at the time we where there. The waitress apologized in advance as she delivered my burger - it had a whole, cold, hard boiled egg on top of it. When I questioned why the egg was prepared this way she just said she doesn't know and laughed as she walked away. After we ate and our meeting was over I asked for a check and gave the waitress my credit card. A strange thing that I noticed is that she went behind the bar where we couldn't see her and 15 minutes later she came back with the receipt. I've noticed other waitresses using a credit card machine next to the kitchen. Since I am in the technology and security business I am always cautious about  identity and credit card theft. Sure enough, 45 minutes later I received a call from my bank saying that my credit card has been compromised and someone attempted to purchase $630 worth of smoking products in Kentucky. I called TGIF and spoke to the manager and let her know that there might be a credit card skimmer. Of course they denied everything and the conversation was over in under 1 minute. This place is under a terrible management. Food, service and staff are way below average, especially for this business area. I wouldn't recommend this establishment just from this personal experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard
Ashley S.,"Wheaton, IL",6,2,15,1.0,3/28/2016,"Being a server for years myself, i believe a review is ncessary at this point. Every single time i have come here, we have to wait for a hostess to show up..during which any server that passes does not acknowledge presence or even say hello. The steps of service are nowhere near the level they should be at. Timing is always so off. Always wait at least 5 minutes for a server to walk by and only say ill be back, not to ask for drink orders or anything. When they finally come back to take the order, it then takes another 5-10 minutes for the drinks. When i order the appetizer with the drinks, thinking it might speed up the process, it still takes 20 minutes to arrive. (I received my order while writing my interview..) the food runner didnt know where to go, while the server yells across the restaurant at her. When she finally figures it out, she turns away to keep talking with food in her hand hovering about the table and it slides right off the plate onto the table...(pretty sure this is the manager) tha then proceeds to ask us how they taste..??? Told her i havent tried them yet? Completely unbelievable that this is the kind of service i receive EVERY SINGLE TIME I come here. Im glad the server/bartender brought our food out while we waited instead of letting the food sit under the window. But that didnt change the fact that the bacon on my burger was stale and jerky-like. The croutons in the BROWNED ceasar were soggy or that the avacado for the nachos we finally got were brown. Horrendous. I think its about time i gave up on this place. Service if absolute bullshit for the volume...hire more servers or train them. I guess you cant fix stupid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard
Trevor D.,"Avon Lake, OH",1,8,1,1.0,5/4/2015,"Sitting for 30 minutes at the bar.  After 10 minutes I was given a menu and a drink request.  Now it has been 45 minutes and no one has asked me if I wanted something to eat.  Just to test my theory of service I am waiting, literally, for someone to ask me if I want dinner.  Bar is empty, restaurant is emptying out, still no request.  It is 8:43. And I have been here for an hour. Now it is 9:06, still no request for dinner.  Going back to the hotel to order room service. Disappointed, usually so consistent around the country.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lombard
