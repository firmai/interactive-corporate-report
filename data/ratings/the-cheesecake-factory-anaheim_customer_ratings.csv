565,Melissa J.,"Cerritos, CA",244,566,263.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered: Mushroom Lettuce Wraps - Great ginger flavor.  Visually appears oily and that is exactly what it is.  Leaves a horrible oil-coating feeling on your palette...  Wild Mushroom Flatbread - The flavors on this were just ok.  Nothing I would care offering anyone to try.   Garlic Noodles - A little plain in my opinion.  There is a garlic flavor, but if the name of the dish is GARLIC NOODLES, I would expect more of a garlic kick.  If you are looking for a non-heavy pasta, this would be a good choice. Side Caesar - I love my caesar salads, but this one didn't really make the cut.  A little bland and not much of that caesar dressing kick. Tuxedo Cheesecake - Definitely my favorite flavor I have tried amongst all the other flavors. OVERALL - Was never impressed by this place even from the first time I have ever tried it.  Sure there menu is huge, but even from the many entrees I tried I still haven't found one that makes me want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=720,3.84,3.74,3.74,3.34,3.7800000000000002
593,Giancarla C.,"Anaheim, CA",180,343,317.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"Be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait. Didja know that Cheesecake Factory (in general, not just this location) was in a book about the best places to meet people? True story, and it's due to the fact that it can take SUCH a long time to get seated and tuck in. This branch is no exception and probably is the busiest restaurant in the Gardenwalk. My new favorites here are the corn fritters for an appetizer and the Jamaican Pepper Chicken with rice. Super delicious and yummy! As usual, their menu is gynormous and it can be so hard to pick. Honestly, I've tried many different entrees here and I can't say I remember ever being disappointed. Yes, they're not cheap eats but they do give you very sizable portions which could necessitate a doggy bag.  Don't forget to get your pass validated! They've recently tightened up parking here and they USED to be free if validated but now I think it's only free up to a certain amount of time but don't quote me on that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=700,3.8,3.73,3.73,3.472,3.758

Whenever my boyfriend and I aren't sure of where to eat, we ALWAYS end up here. The portion is perfect, the ambiance and service is on point, and the food is without a doubt, always satisfying.  Most people don't realize this because it seems more like a dinner kinda restaurant...but breakfast here is BOMB. If you're looking for a fancier, up-scale restaurant similar to The Cheesecake Factory, try their other chain restaurant: The Grand Lux located in LA.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=540,3.76,3.75,3.75,3.472,3.754
676,Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213.0,4.0,2012-01-11,"The best default Seriously, this place never disappoints.  I'll start with the negative, because there's really only one and that's wait time.  Since it's so close to the Disneyland Resort, if you hit this place up on the weekend, you could easily end up waiting 1.5 - 2 hours.  It gets crazy busy.  Whenever anything is that crowded, I get really uncomfortable and kind of disagreeable... I'm saying large crowds turn me into a prick.  So I stay away.  This review is based on lunches and early weeknight dinners.  Basically getting a head start on my senior dining lifestyle. Lunches and early weeknight dinners don't really have me dealing with large crowds.  10min wait time max.  The staff here is really friendly and very prompt - I was pretty surprised how quickly everything ran here and how many refills I got.  They easily surpassed my refill standards. The menu is huge and, for the most part, everything on it is pretty good.  Burgers, pasta, steaks, chicken - all super tasty.  AND Cheesecake Factory is still one of the few places to serve a large basket of delicious bread... I could easily fill up on their sourdough and squaw bread. And wife and I can't leave without sharing some cheesecake - I think it's mandatory that you order some.  This is usually a pretty easy decision - the red velvet cheesecake is most wonderfully glutenous thing I've ever had for dessert.  It's perfect size for sharing or if you're going through some issues in your life, it's still the perfect size for pigging out on it by yourself. It's really the best default place in town - large menu with great food and service.  After experimenting with so many over hyped and kind of crappy trendy joints (I'm looking at you, new hipsterish gatropubs like chapter one), I appreciate a franchised solid consistent experience like cheesecake factory.   If you can get around or deal with the crowds, you'll have to try to have a bad experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=460,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.504,3.76
731,Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,913,2115.0,4.0,2012-01-16,"I eat at A LOT of Cheesecake Factory restaurants and since this one  is in my own backyard I have high expectations for them because they're across the street from the world landmark, happiest place on earth, eyesore for some and eyegasm for most...Disneyland! That being said, I can tell you if you're from out of town and you want to eat somewhere that gives generous portions, fancy ambiance, and at moderate prices then you definitely need to eat here because you'll get your moneys worth.        PROS: Food's pretty much on point every time and they have a VARIETY of items to choose from and have a page or more on just chicken, pasta, meat, and fish dishes as well as an array of appetizers. There's a happy hour Mon - Fri from 5 - 7(?), dessert options are all good, wheat and sour dough bread to start are always filling and refillable. They also offer a skinnylicious menu that's under 570 calories (plus or minus) and I had two chicken items and a hamburger off of it and I can say it's deliciously filling for being part of a healthy choice menu.    CONS: Service is never consistent and I'll give this location in particular a 77% average of everything going well without some sort of waiter error or kitchen mishap, but this is sub par for Cheesecake Factory.  KEEP IN MIND: WAIT TIME CAN BE AS LONG AS SPACE MOUNTAIN: If it's a holiday or a weekend and it's dinner time, expect a 30 - 40 minute wait time, but majority of the time that's not really the case it's usually about five to ten minutes less.        *On a busy day I suggest finding a spot at the bar section if you can. The bartenders are pretty nice and I've received the best service from the guys at the bar AND you're in front of the T.V's so if you're into sports that's a plus.  APPROXIMATE COST: To give you an idea money wise for two people, an appetizer, two entree's at about $15 each, two cheesecakes, and one strawberry lemonade and one water came out to $62 total. Average meal runs you approximately $10 - $13 for burger dishes, $15 - $19 dollars per person for pasta or chicken dishes with steak, shrimp, or fish entrees at about $18 - $25. I guarantee you a party of four can walk out with a bill of at least $120. I know for a fact you could spend the same amount of money at any one of the restaurants at Downtown Disney or inside Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure park and you'll get maybe a soda, chips, and a corn dog.      Definitely eat here versus anywhere in Downtown Disney or the parks if you want more for your money. Again, three stars is my personal standard for the restaurant itself, but for the location it's the best place to eat on the block.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=520,3.72,3.76,3.76,3.472,3.7439999999999998

My go to burger is the BBQ Bacon Burger. My mouth cannot open wide enough to take a bite out of this monster! It's really delicious and it fills you up. One of the reasons I like Cheesecake Factory is cuz of their ginormous portions and fair prices. They got a variety of food and drinks. I recommend this to anybody who likes food basically. The waiters are extremely nice and are not always in  a rush like other places.

But we asked to be moved and we got moved right away. The waiters were all very nice and polite and out side was very romantic. The food was delicious!

But, today I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Sandwich (in the burger section) and I had to write a review to tell you not to get it. It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't delicious. It was also extremely difficult to eat. The bun is all wrong for this type of veggie. I picked it up and everything slipped out the bottom. The eggplant was a little too al dente so I had to cut it with a knife to eat it. I liked the flavor but it would've been much better with feta cheese. It comes with garlic aioli on the bun but I asked for extra and I dipped the fries in it. So, yummy! Better than ranch dressing any day!. I got the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake for dessert and loved it. It is so tart and yummy that you just can't stop eating it.  I was bummed to find out that the add gratuity for 6 people, I thought is was only parties of 8 or more. Our waiter was so slow and we kept looking for him. FYI: My fav is the Carmel Chicken. If you're craving chinese food then order this. I do think it's weird that they call it Carmel Chicken because it doesn't taste like carmel at all. It taste like a crunchy sweet chicken but I don't get carmel at all.

We were never rushed, harassed for the cheque, or treated differently.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory, I get the exact same thing - the pan-seared salmon over angel hair pasta, capers, and spinach. It tastes as good as it sounds, but unfortunately this branch did not have it on their menu. I ventured to ask Sarah why, and she said they'd try to make it for me without a moment's hesitation.  Venturing to the kitchen, she asked her manager about it, looked up the recipe from another Cheesecake factory, and made it exactly to spec. Talk about imitative! I have not experienced better service like this in a long, long time. Most other places would've said ""well, this ain't that other branch"" over some finger snaps and sass. Overall, I cannot compliment Sarah-May and her crew enough for giving us nothing short of an extraordinary, amazing end to the night.

To drink I got the hot caramel apple cider, which I first had that cold December night. This time is was a cold February night and my roommates and I had just been on Space Mountain 2 times so we were cold. Plus it tastes like apple pie in a cup. For dinner I was feeling a burger so I got the original (also the cheapest at $10) and I got that with no bun and wrapped in lettuce (protein style). It was good but the lettuce to patty ratio was ridiculous. It was pretty much just a whole head of lettuce that someone put a hamburger patty inside. There was WAY too much lettuce. And the fries were good, but just like the fries at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco, there was too much salt on them. The service was pretty fast though, but it was pretty late in the evening, around 10 PM. But the food was just 'eh'.

Every location, always looks good, always tastes good.  Choices, choices! Too many choices!  My favorite items?  Chicken Costoletta, lightly breaded chicken breast, sautéed with lemon sauce,  served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Discovered on date, and a favorite ever since!  My new favorite item?  Tuscan chicken from the skinnylicious menu, grilled chicken breast with artichokes, tomatoes, capers, basil and a vinaigrette. Served with veggies and farro (looked like rice).   You get all the bang with portions but you can finish the dish and have guilt free dessert afterwards!  Cheesecake? My biggest complaint is that they discontinued my favorite cake, the tres leches cheesecake!  I'm not so picky anymore and open to try whatever my party desires to split.  Not a fan of cheesecake, like my best friend, then we go for the chocolate truffle cake, which is rich and layered with different chocolate variations from mousse, truffle and ganache!   This location has a mix of family tourists with kids running around in their crocs, casual locals grabbing a bite or some dressed up hotties looking to splurge!

They used a lot of mushrooms to fill up the dish. I've also tried a ""special"" they had one night: pecaned salmon with assorted veggies. This dish was beyond awful. The salmon was dried out, the pecan tasteless. It was a disaster to say the least. However, their cheesecakes are pretty good, though they are ultra sweet and heavy. As for service, my experiences have varied. I've had a waitress give some attitude and stink eyes before. But I've also had the staff man up to a mistake and take an item off the bill.

This particular location is in the Anaheim Gardenwalk, which was right next to our hotel (technically vacation resort, the Worldmark) and we just wanted to walk to dinner.  I pretty much get one thing and one thing only at Cheesecake Factory and that is the Tuna Tataki salad. It is always very fresh with nicely seared tuna, juicy red tomatoes, lovely slices of avacado with nice mixed greens and a soy vinagrette. I can eat that and not feel too guilty about eating gobs of the delicious brown bread they bring to the table. They also bring some french bread, but I only have eyes for the brown bread. It is so yummy my three year old was calling it ""cake"". My mother had the herb crusted salmon and she was positively swooning over it. I don't really remember what my husband ate, but he seemed pretty happy too.  The kids had grilled cheese and chicken strips and they both enjoyed themselves and the portions were generous. The menu is huge and you can find just about anything you might want from American classics to Asian influenced dishes to some south of the border flavor. Oh and most people rave about the cheesecake, of course. Honestly, I don't care for cheesecake. I have had the cheesecakes here and they are better than most, but usually I will get a sundae if I have dessert at all. The hot fudge is pretty decadent and the slivered almonds add just the right touch. The kids ice cream dish was only $1, so that was quite a deal for the little ones. Most Cheesecake Factory locations can be packed and I am sure this one is no exception, however on a Tuesday night in November we had no wait at all. Service was pretty good, although they have seperate servers who deliver the food from the ones who take your order.

Of course the Cheesecake Factory is much more reasonably priced, around $15-$25 a plate.  I had the Moroccan chicken one night, which was a grilled chicken on top of a bed of pearl couscous with some type of creamy tomato sauce. I don't live anywhere near a Cheesecake Factory, but I can tell you it will be worth the 1 hr drive to go there to get this dish next time I go out to dinner. :-P I also had the second night the sausage and broccolini pasta, which was incredibly good but turned out to have a bazillion calories so I only ate half of it for dinner and had the rest for lunch the next day.  My only complaint about the restaurant which is why I knocked them down a star is that they don't have the waiters and waitresses bringing out your food so there are no checks to make sure your food is correct. Out of two nights of dinners for two people (4 entrees and 2 desserts), they messed up 3 of our dishes. For example, I didn't actually order the Moroccan Chicken, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. But the Moroccan Chicken is what came, and once I started eating that they weren't going to get it back!!

Once it was late night.  This is the positive side of this review; they were open later than most of the other restaurants in the area.  The food was ok, the service on this particular night was good. Here is the down side; went there for lunch today and had the exact opposite experience.  Service was less than good, an appetizer ordered was delivered to the wrong table and not corrected until our entire meal was almost over (yes, they comped it off the bill).  I ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich, and there was practically nothing right about it.  The chicken was over cooked and dry, there was virtually no sauce on it, the cheese wasn't melted and the sandwich was served luke-warm. Other members of my party ordered salads, which were huge.  Literally, huge.   But to me, this is not doing lunch right.  A business lunch should take an hour and 45 minutes to get through.  You shouldn't get a salad the size of a spare tire from a Toyota, and it shouldn't cost nearly $15.  Right sized portions, right priced portions - I really don't care if their menu is 26 pages, if they can't get lunch salads right, why bother?

We were all a bit confused by this because it clearly states the item in the Pasta section of the menu. My coworker decides on a different dish and we call again. This time she tells the guy taking the order that she wanted the lunch herb crusted salmon. He then tells her that they don't have a herb crusted salmon, that they only have a cedar plank salmon. Really?! Ok, she says she will have to call back with a different order. We were a bit baffled. Were we looking at the wrong menu? We did click on the Anaheim location. This time around, I decided to call and make the order. I waited about 30 seconds for the take-out employee to take my order. I started off with asking for the BBQ Rancho Chicken Salad - surely they had that on their menu, right? Yes, yes they did! Hooray. One down, two to go. Next, I asked for Evelyn's favorite pasta. YAY, they DO have it! Lastly, Herb Crusted Salmon. Fingers crossed... Confirmed!  After the order was complete, she repeated back everything to me and offered the complimentary bread. Since it was the lunch time rush, she said it would take about 25-30 minutes. No big deal.

Sixteen of us, they hand us our bills, ask us if everything is correct and I notice my salad is $2.50 more?

Well that stupid charge they put on was for 'extra' blue cheese' and the waitress said 'sorry, that's for extra cheese'  and she did not offer to take it off even after asking all of us if the bill was correct.

I came here with a friend after work and we were both super impressed with the selection of appetizers and cocktails for only $5 each!  What we had: Avocado Eggrolls - the eggrolls were super creamy and perfectly crispy! I don't care much for the sauce they come with since it is sweet. The avocados are flavorful enough that you don't even need sauce anyway. Fried Macaroni and Cheese - Delicious...simply tasty little er.. BIG fried balls of oogey gooey cheesy goodness. I like the marinara sauce they garnish the plate with too. Adds a little more flavor without being overpowering. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - Your usual artichoke and spinach dip. Couldn't taste any cheese really, not very creamy. The chips weren't the greatest, but I may be too critical because I'm used to the real deal tortilla chips. Roadside Sliders - The meat was cooked just right and the buns were soft. Normally I need cheese on a a burger, but improvised with putting a little of the spinach dip on it. Tasted delicious, especially dunked in ranch! J.W.'s Pink Lemonade - YUMMY! You have the option to get their cocktails ""skinny"" which is 150 calories or less. I tried it and was very pleased with the flavor. Couldn't really taste the alcohol, but don't let that fool you, the drinks aren't weak. Cosmopolitan - I think I've only had one other Cosmo in my life which was a while ago since I can't remember. I decided to refresh my memory and try theirs. STRONG. Not a bad thing, but I remember why I prefer other cocktails. All in all, the food and drinks were good and cheap!

They come to work looking beautiful, elegant, nicely dressed, and they make them clean. Me thinks that is very cheesy of the cheesecake factory.

717,Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,14,2.0,1.0,2013-08-24,"Very bad experience with this shitty place. After a brutal hike at Griffith Park we had to go to Anaheim to hang out at someone's house. On the way there, we endured traffic jams so heavy that we got hungry and randomly picked this Cheesecake factory to drop by. We just planned to go there, shovel up as much food and drink as we could into our growling stomachs and get out of there. We phoned in a reservation and the lady in front gave us a time: 4:15PM. So we show up exactly at that time only to be told that ""the time we quote you over the phone is the time we put your name in the waiting list"". Then I saw an empty table which would fit our party of 9 and asked the manager why could she not seat us at that table. She then dumbly said that ""that table is reserved"". Well, I thought that the time quoted over the phone is the time that we get put on the waiting list? Those people who ""reserved"" the empty table I pointed out were not even there yet so how could they have been reserved a table if they have not arrived ergo, their names are not yet in the waiting list? Why does she have the gall to tell us we have to wait and we came at the appointed time (4:15PM) and the people at the empty table would be seated RIGHT AWAY as soon as they arrive? It makes ZERO SENSE and she is an idiot. The portrayal of the bimbo-like character of a typical Cheesecake Factory staffer as ""Penny"" in the Big Bang Theory is pretty accurate. The only thing is they are dumber in real life and unlike Penny, they are unattractive. Anyway, I think I know what it is. It is plain and simple racism. Look at the reviews. Most reviews that fall below 3 stars are of those who are not of the white race. I have heard of this Orange County BS about this thing going on. Never mind that I earn a lot more in a month than the manager earns in a year.

The average price for an entrée portion of the menu will cost about $15.      The Cheesecake Factory consists of a large array of foods, extending from salads to filet mignon.  The restaurants' signature items are their famous cheesecakes!  With selections from Double Dark Chocolate to Lemon Raspberry along with nearly 50 other choices it's hard for one to pick a favorite.  Creaminess and richness just begin to describe the bold flavors your palette will long for after you take one bite of cheesecake.  If you're looking for a rich slice of heaven then this is definitely the eatery to dine at!   The Cheesecake Factory offers much more than just sweet and delicious slices of cheesecake.  With a menu resembling a short story, its glossy slick pages offer an extensive assortment of appetizers, entrees, and of course luscious desserts that will not leave anyone hungry.  Appetizers vary from Veggie Eggrolls to Fried Calamari, with many other ethnic offerings.  Entrees include pizzas, sandwiches, and even elaborate plates of seafood and steak.  My favorite being the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, served with your favorite side choice of Fries, Coleslaw, or even a small salad.  With such a wide variety of foods to choose from, there is something for everyone, even picky eaters, as the chefs will cook a dish to your liking.   A nice cold or warm soothing drink is the perfect way to balance out the wonderful array of food the restaurant offers.  Likewise, The Cheesecake Factory's list of beverages to choose from is astounding.  With many delightful drinks to choose from, such as colorful cocktails and various beers, strawberry-lemonade to creamy multi-flavored milkshakes, there's a drink for everyone!  That is an important asset to the restaurants success because it adds to the restaurants reputation of having something for everyone.  The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most well-known restaurant chains in the country, and is the perfect outing for a delectable meal and scrumptious dessert.  I'd recommend this restaurant due to their outstanding cheesecakes and large selection of foods, along with efficient service.

The food unfortunately is where this review goes downhill. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. The breading was almost gummy and there were pieces that stuck together to make giant greasy calamari clumps. My boyfriend for the shrimp and chicken gumbo which came with absolutely zero shrimp. Other than that, he said it tasted fine, but still when you expect shrimp , it's kind of disappointing. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. While the menu didn't specify, I expected a chicken breast with my pasta. I was dismayed to find cut chicken pieces that had random bones and cartilage in them plus extremely fatty skin. The garlic sauce was also kind of bland and  thin so the pasta itself didn't have much flavor to it. Despite our disappointing meals, we of course had to order cheesecake (never gone wrong there).

440,Robert B.,"La Jolla, CA",1008,346,347.0,1.0,2013-09-30,"My family and I decided to stop at this Cheescake Factory on the way back from Disneyland earlier this evening. We enjoy the Cheescake Factory in. Fashion Valley here in San Diego where the food is excellent with good service. We thought we would enjoy the same service at this Anaheim location.  Well we were disappointed. Even though our waitress was polite and efficient, the food server was rude and condescending. When she served us a bowl of soup she slid it across the table like she was a cook in the Navy chow hall. She was in such a hurry she couldn't slow down enough to properly serve the food (which appeared to be her only job by the way).  We were a little taken aback by her abrupt manner but we let it slide.  However later I mistook her for our waitress and I asked her for another glass of wine. She did not even respond to my request but instead gave me a look that showed me and my family that she didn't  want to either take the time nor be bother with such a request as a customer asking for something. Everyone at my table was appalled by her look of disdain. What made matters worse is that we were there to celebrate my step-daughter's birthday.  I requested to speak to the manager because of this woman's attitude and requested that she and her negative energy stay away from our table. The manager was cool-he apologized and listened to my complaint about this young lady and comped us a free glass of wine and dessert. But our bill was expensive and we certainly did not need any attitude from the staff.  I personally feel these restaurants in Anaheim get tired of dealing with the Disneyland crowd. Well guess what bitches? It it wasn't for the tourism dollars your ass would be on unemployment.

It took our server 30 min to take our drink and food order and after that another hour to get our food. When he brought my friend her food she told him that's not what she ordered and he argued that it was. When he looked at his notes he then said ""oh we don't carry that anymore so I just ordered you the next closest thing."" As she told him she didn't want that another server bringing out the rest of the food heard them arguing and said ""we still carry that!"", explained the dish to my friend and she said ""yes!! That's what I ordered"" and the other server fixed the order for her. By the time her food came out everyone was done and our original server told us he would be back with the check. It took him FIFTY-FIVE minutes to bring our check!! In between that he would walk by and say he was coming back but never did. It wasn't until we asked for the manager an hour into our wait that he had a server (not a manager) come over and tell us he was getting our bill and would be right back.

I could not even tell you how many pages of items there were! I was totally overwhelmed but thankfully when the waitress got our drink order I asked her for recommendation and instead of saying, ""Oh, everything is good"" she really narrowed it down. She gave me some of her favorites as well as a popular choices of customers. It truly helped since I had no idea what to get!  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and was not disappointed!

The Cheesecake Factory is the 'it' restaurant for little teens to impress their first dates. I'm not ashamed to say The Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favourite restaurants and I think it will remain that way. I am reviewing this location because I've been to this one several times when I was working at the Wells Fargo building a few years back. I've been here twice this year - once with my Italian visiting friend and a more recent time with my friends. You could never really go wrong here with their extensive and very easy menu. The Chicken Madeira, Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Ahi Tuna Salad are the items I would usually get - yes, this is the only time where I go 'big' I suppose. Yet the last two times I was here I asked for the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, an item I always overlooked. The Lemon Roasted Chicken is a half chicken that is already quartered for you. it comes with soft carrots and a very flavourful bunch of watercress paired with their usual mashers. The chicken was SO tender and flavourful - even both my guests agreed when they tried it! How could I have missed this the numerous times I've been here? It is clearly my new favourite!

Both dishes were good. The burger had a deep fried mac and cheese ball on top of the patty that was again topped with more cheese (melted cheesey goodness). Their fries were so-so, just didn't like that they were cut so small, made them hard to dip without getting my fingers in the ketchup. The mahi mahi is on their skinnylicious menu and for it being a little under 600, it is quite flavorful. If and when I order a cheesecake here, I always get the classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Because he is in love with the godiva chocolate cheesecake, we went with that. I must admit, this cheesecake is addicting. It has layers of FLOURLESS godiva chocolate cake, godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse.

We waited for the lemon and eventually my friend got up and asked him again. (please keep in mind that we're persistent because I am ill and I need the lemon to balance out a taste of metal I have from treatments). He said he forgot and that he will come back with it. Low and behold he came back alright...with three toothpicks and lemons skewed on them that he was holding with his hands. WHY WAS IT NOT IN A BOWL! Doesn't that violate some rules? I ended up not drinking anything and we did not use those lemons.

So I asked our waiter if this was a cobb salad and he said no, that I had ordered a different salad. I said okay... just miscommunication. I would like a cobb salad please, so he took it back. I told my friends to go ahead and eat without me because I didn't want their food to get cold.15 minutes later my salad still didn't come out.

Not because our hotel was that far but because we didn't want to torture the little one with more walking after an all day at Disneyland. We GPS'ed our way over to the parking garage and were kind of sticker shocked. It was not cheap so kind of a bummer to get to this strip of restaurants (They had a McCormick's as well as PF Chang's as neighbors).  I hail from land of Seattle where parking 'is' expensive and I was surprised to see that Seattle was cheaper than here.  The lines were poured out onto the sidewalk as well as all seats taken inside the lobby. I was able to snag a seat since a group got seated before us.  Our total wait time was estimated to be around 20 mins. It took about that amount of time so nothing exciting to report there.  What was interesting to see was that there were several people who had pagers that had gone off and still had to wait for a seat once they turned in their pagers. Not sure where the disconnect was but was a little annoying for those people. As for food, we were seated in a booth in the back by the restrooms. Which was ok with me as we had our little one with us and she wasn't feeling well (read: sleepy and on Mommy's chest).  We ended up with two servers for our party of two because apparently they were in the middle of shift change. So that meant that our 'new' server didn't fully know our drinks and he didn't check on us but once. Kind of that annoying side of Cheesecake where they are so large and have every possible seat filled for dinner that you can often be left alone for way too long.  I ordered the BBQ salmon despite getting fresher salmon back home as I was missing home. I was so disappointed to have my salmon come out baked.. with BBQ sauce literally slathered on top post-bake. How I have known BBQ salmon is to be baked WITH sauce on it so it actually marinates and cooks into the fish.

I knew that this particular location would probably be really busy because of its location -- right smack dab in the middle of the resort area, a stone's throw from Disneyland. So, it's probably smart to figure out what to get before you go. There are no prices online, so I had a few things in mind in case some things were too pricey.  We get to the restaurant at about 8 pm, and it is as packed as I anticipated. There was a bit of a wait for a table, but we were seated within fifteen minutes. We were seated outside, but it was nice because it was quieter outside and there were heat lamps. Our waiter, Jared, was very pleasant and quick. He got our drinks and bread right away, and offered suggestions for food. The food was okay -- we got some burgers that were pretty good, but not worth $12. We got a few slices of cheesecake to go. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and the hubs got some caramel turtle cheesecake thing. Both were very good!  Basically, the place is great if you want to stop in for dessert or if you feel like splurging.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=440,3.0,3.71,3.66,3.5,3.426

For a Sunday evening the restaurant was quite busy but not overly packed.  We were seated within 5 minutes. That past weekend I had Korean BBQ and Japanese BBQ so I was in a mood for something healthy and small.  I took to their appetizer menu and their Thai lettuce wraps sounded delicious and just what I was looking for.  Cheesecake Factory is known for their epic entrée portions and their ""appetizers"" was no exception.  When the Thai lettuce wraps came out I was in disbelief that what I had ordered was an ""appetizer"". The portions are huge! My boyfriend ordered one of their burritos and it was ginormous! The menu describes the Thai lettuce wraps as ""Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles, and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamaribd - Cashew"" and that's exactly what I got! It was very delicious!! The meal was light yet very filling. I would definitely order this again. As for drinks, my boyfriend and I ordered hot tea.

Everything ended up being absolutely great! We got to the Factory around 9:45 ish on a Saturday night and I guess while prom was going on? So you would think that it was going to be an absolute nightmare, it totally wasn't! We got seated in less that 5 minutes, when we were told our table would take about 5-10 minutes, so I was really happy about that. Right away, a server came to our table, did his spiel and got our drink orders. My boyfriend did order something from the bar and I thought it was going to take long but again I was totally surprised when he brought it out very fast. The server was really great; his name was George and he was really nice, cracking jokes with us and checked up on us enough to where we didn't have to hunt him down for anything and he wasn't checking up so often to where it was annoying either. The only thing I will say I didn't like was the pricing; I mean, $18 for pasta is a little ridiculous, I like to think of what in really paying for and I don't think any pasta should be over $13 there because it's not THAT huge of a portion, but it is good, and I did go because I had a gift card so that's okay. We ordered the mint mojito ($11) which my boyfriend said was really good, avocado egg rolls ($10.95) also really good and came out about 5 minutes after we ordered, and the jambalaya pasta ($17.50)which came out literally a minute after the egg rolls. We never waited long at all for our food. Everything was tasty and then the cheesecake of course was just the best. With over 34 cakes to choose from, it was really difficult to choose; we ordered and Oreo cheesecake ($7.95) and a dutch apple streusel ($7.50) which the server recommended. Thank god he told us to get that one because it was SO good, it was like eating a carmel apple pie with cheesecake. And of course the Oreo one was amazing because it had layers of cookie, chocolate, cookies and cream and chocolate chips!! These are huge and rich slices so they can totally be shared after a big meal.

The mixture of flavors literally just bursts in your mouth!! As for drinks, mango margarita is super good. Tasted like they used real mangos and you can barely even taste the alcohol.

For dessert, (all you chocolate lovers) Godiva chocolate cheesecake with whipped cream! :) Service: The staff was really friendly and were pretty quick with their service.

Unfortunately, it wasn't all that impressive. Place was swamped when we walked in around 6:00pm.  Quoted 30 minute wait, but it turned out to be closer to 45.   No issues with service, we had two servers who handling everything better than we could have asked for.  Always refilling drinks and bread without us having to ask. Kitchen.  A bit slow.  There were six of us, and after ordering the waitress came over and told me they were out of the Chicken & Biscuits I had ordered.  I had to get a menu and re-order.  Then, after snacking on bread for a good 20-30 minutes, by replacement order arrives, but without the rest of my family's orders.  Not sure how that happened.  But it was a solid 10 minutes before the rest of the food came.  So I was faced with either starting to eat before the rest of the table, or eating cold food.  Ordered the Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi combo.  Good steak, but only about 4 pieces, and three shrimp.  Something like $19.95.  Overpriced for a plate that was mostly mushroom gravy. Second food run brought all the food except for one.  A manager came over and told us my daughter's pizza had been burned, so they were making another.  A bit inconvenient, but not a serious problem.  But then I looked at my son's pizza, and it too was burned.  They served him a pizza that was black around the edges and dark brown/crunchy on the bottom.  Our waitress saw it and immediately offered to make a new one.  I was glad to see her take the initiative so I didn't have to send his food back to the kitchen.   Whoever was in charge of the pizza oven needs some retraining.  It was bothersome that they held back one burned pizza and remade it but served another burned pizza. In all, it was a mediocre meal that cost over $120.  Certainly not worth waiting as long as we did.  I felt bad for our waitress, since she was busting her hump to take care of us and the issues were with the kitchen, not the service.

Just one of those people who has natural charisma. He almost correctly guessed we were from New Zealand, Australia is the next closest guess haha. When he saw my face at the size of my burrito (which was insanely huge) he cracked into this grin and made a joke about weight...lol I won't repeat it but we all cracked up.

The portion sizes were good enough to feed us both, since we also planned to order a Strawberry Cheesecake to share.

The most UNPROFESSIONAL customer service I have ever received anywhere, and it actually makes for a pretty good story. Came here at 2:00 pm for an afternoon lunch break from Disneyland. It was not crowded at all, and my boyfriend and I were seated right away. And that's when things turned sour. Just as we were about to place our order, a MASSIVE black beetle the size of a half dollar crawled out of the cushion of our booth, right next to my boyfriend. We were very alarmed and immediately moved away to avoid it. And that's not even the worst of it... Because hey, it's summer, and unfortunately, bugs happen. So here's the horrible part: Our waitress looks at the beetle and says, ""Ewww that's soooo gross!"" She then hands my boyfriend a PAPER NAPKIN and asks him to KILL IT! He was so shocked he didn't know what to do, so I jumped in and said ""Are you kidding me? NO, he is absolutely NOT going to kill that thing!"" (as it's still creepily crawling towards us). So the waitress proceeds to ask us to place our order and we sat there dumbfounded that she wouldn't even consider accommodating us. We, THE CUSTOMERS, had to request to be moved to a different table because of the beetle situation! She tells us to just scoot down to the other end of the booth.  At that point, I don't even know why we stayed at the restaurant, but we were really hungry, so perhaps our judgement was impaired. But little did we know, we were in for even more disappointment. Omelette was under-cooked, toast was burned black, food was generally very greasy. But it took so long for the food to come out that we didn't want to bother requesting anything different and having even more delays. Who do they have working here on Saturday afternoons, anyway?? In our experience, this place is way overpriced with extremely sub-par service.

754,Richard M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",61,39,,1.0,2014-08-27,"I have been to nearly every cheesecake factory between mission Viejo and Hollywood. So the LA county and Orange County. This is by far the WORST cheesecake factory I have been to.  To start, the entire restaurant was empty when we got there and they sat us down right next to a loud party in a corner.  That was already uncomfortable. I asked if they could move us away from them and they said they couldn't do it. Alright fine we waited for them to leave and we were fine. Except for the fact that all their dirty dishes were left there the entire 2 hours we were there. Bus boys not working there or something?  Not one thing was done right. Waited about 10 min to get our drink orders taken. Appetizers (fried macoroni) came out cold,  and swimming In sauce.  Bread came second (they didnt even bring it. They asked if we wanted it)  at that it was cold and uncut.  None of our plates were taken away (incliding appetizer plates and bread basket) until the dessert came. Our food came out burnt, fruit was sour and has gone bad. Ordered fies....those came out cold. Did I mention we got absolutely no refills?? The dessert was the only thing that was done half right. The half was correct was the half where the cheesecake tasted good and was brought out quickly. The wrong part is that we told them it was my friends birthday and they did nothing for them.  There is a cheesecake factory just a couple miles up the freeway in Brea. They have not messed up a single time  I would strongly encourage that you go their as you will get the service that you paid for.

307,Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",128,66,667.0,3.0,2014-09-24,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory locations very often, as I usually view them as somewhat overpriced for mediocre food. I feel like you're paying a bit more for the ""trendy ambiance"" rather than for quality, spectacular food. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a very difficult person to please - especially when it comes to food. I just feel that The Cheesecake Factory can be a bit overrated - it seems more of a novelty than anything. I've been to this location a few times and have received great service. Any inconveniences that myself or anyone else dining with me may have encountered during our visits were promptly and justly addressed - such as apologizing for an error in the kitchen which would cause a delay in receiving a food order and offering an appetizer or other item free of charge. Since this is just a few skips away from Disneyland, beware that it is in the middle of a tourist stomping ground, and you may have to wait a bit longer for a table depending on the time of the day you decide to attend. One of the upsides is that they do offer take-out, so if you are staying at a nearby hotel, you may order ahead of time and just take your food back to your room.

Service from our wait staff was just ok and a little condescending. After having ordered, it took a very long time to get our drinks. Food took a while to arrive as well, and entrees were served staggered, so that a few got their food well before others. Although food portions were large, the quality and taste were just mediocre . This had been my experience from years past and, sadly, the same holds true today. The gigantic menu (nearly 20 pages) and overwhelming choices probably hinder a job well done. As well, prices are a bit high (although it might be, in part, due to close proximity to Disneyland).

A little concerned about parking availability, I did just a bit of research and discovered there's a huge parking garage just a few doors down right next to Bubba Gumps, so I was relieved. I arrived at the garage at 12 noon and there was plenty of parking. First 60 minutes are free, then it's about $6 for the hour after, etc. However, if you validate at one of the restaurants here, I believe you get an additional 3 free hours .....or something like that....yay! Just a short walk from the garage we arrive at the front door of the Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much the same setup as all the other Cheesecake Factories I'd been to in the US. The nice and friendly hostess at the podium greeted us as we entered....and immediately sat us as the place wasn't crowded at all.....and no line waiting for a table....all the other CFs I'd been too were packed with at least a 10-20 minute wait. I'm actually pretty surprised, but I guess everybody was busy at the park. What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food here. Pretty much the same as any other CF.....very extensive and one can easily be overwhelmed with all the yummy choices! SO it's good if you're a regular and know pretty much what there is and what you're going to order.  The server (Alana) I think was so totally friendly, helpful, and attentive throughout. Always checking on us to make sure we were happy and whether we needed anything. In fact, one of our friends had some ankle problem and made a request for a bag of ice to ice it down.....and Alana was more than happy to do this for him! Knowing how huge the portions of the Entrees are here, we knew we could never finish. So, we went ahead and did a shared style lunch where we'd order an appetizer (Chicken Samosas) to start off, and then each of us would order a ""small plate"" dish...........Avacado Eggrolls, Factory Chopped Salad, and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas......the Grilled Corn Cakes that came with the tortillas were really delicious! But pretty much everything was good as expected. At the end of it all, Alana asked if we would like any dessert?

Erica greeted us with a friendly smile and took our drink order and also brought us the bread. We then ordered Fried Cheese and within a matter of minutes it was out of the fryer and on our table. Cripsy, flaky, ooey-gooey goodness. We then ordered our entree's, Hubby had the Shepard's Pie and I had the Skinnylicious Asian lettuce chicken tacos. And  .god. They were delicious. It was the freshest bite of food I had ever tasted. Like the first bite of Spring with the perfect blend of textures, spices, flavors, and crispiness. Hubby's Shepard's Pie was also fantastic. It was dense, moist, creamy, with a awesome sauce, crisp veggies, and perfectly seasoned ground beef. It melted in your mouth. Both dishes just wonderful!! We were never without drinks and Erica checked on us multiple times to make everything was tasting good and that we had everything we needed. Now it was time for dessert. We ordered one piece of Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake to share and it was so creamy, decadent, smooth, fresh, and moist. Excellent combo if you enjoy carrot cake and cheesecake.

More recently, I went around 6pm and didnt need to wait long for a booth. Cheesecake factory definitely has nice ambiance but theres something about it that still errks me. Ah ha! It's the service and the servers. They don't smile much and they're always too much in a rush to stop and see you tryna flag them down. At least at this location. They're not as attentive and cordial as I would like. So I ordered the Steak Diane + Shrimp Scampi combo for about $20. This came with 3 measly pieces of big fried shrimp and a few small pieces of steak topped with onion and mushroom. The sauce it was marinated in was too sweet and oily. It just didn't really appeal to me and wasn't as good as I thought it would be for that price! My friend ordered the Kobe burger which came with a tiny basket of fries. Being a frequent eater of Kobe, my friend could tell immediately that they had not served him kobe. Our server called upon some random girl, not even dressed or looking like she worked there who came out to talk to us about the burger. She kindly agreed to re-make the burger (which I thought was the right move and good customer service) and they quickly brought out another. This time according to my friend, was in fact real kobe. My friend enjoyed the burger and I thought my plate was so so.  I also had 2 glasses of Merlot, 14 hands for $9/glass - now that I think about it I should have just ordered a bottle with that money. My friend ordered 3 Blue Moons and we shared a Pina Colada at the end. The bill came out to $95. This felt very overpriced or maybe it's just inflation. Overall, the quality of the food was just okay and our server wasn't very friendly at all. She hardly checked on us and if it weren't for the lady who came out and re-made our burger, we would have left feeling disappointed. Honestly, the only thing nice about this place is the lighting.

This orange colored feline has personality, with a clear disdain for doing work and Mondays, being lazy, sarcastic, a bit obnoxious, hating diets, along with abusing Odie the dog and his geeky owner Jon. Despite, his faults, he surely has a softer side for his teddy bear Pooky, sleeping, and most of all FOOD. It's no secret that he loves pasta, pizza, and Italian cuisine. Not to mention the occasional house plant. Now the Cheesecake Factory doesn't serve any shrubs or ferns in their salads, but I think Garfield would be a fan of this restaurant chain, including me. The service and vibe of each location can be slightly different, but I've never had any issues at this Anaheim GardenWalk location. Out of all the times I've dined in, I can't remember a bad experience. Like many of you, I can somewhat deal with the issues if the food is to my liking and that's the case here. CHICKEN MADEIRA It's their most popular chicken dish. I get sucked in almost every visit, ordering this specialty item 95% of the time. Sautéed Chicken Breast topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and served with a mound of Mashed Potatoes. I coat the white bread with butter and dip it into the mushroom sauce. It should be illegal to have this much fun. BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA My favorite pasta dish here. Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil Garlic Lemon Cream Sauce. Never a dull moment when I order this. Hearty and fulfilling, it puts a grin on my face, with a garlicky breath that would make any Korean proud. You honestly can't leave here without some form of cheesecake. Defeats the entire purpose of dining at a location where their distinctive feature matches the name of the establishment. My recommendation? The classic Strawberry Cheesecake.

896,Jessica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,21,1.0,2.0,2015-02-04,"Let me start by saying that we love your restaurant and have never had a bad experience up until last night. We were greeted by our server who from the start did not have a very friendly approach. You could sense her coldness and she never smiled once during our entire visit.  We started by ordering our drinks. A couple beers, an Odouls and a kids chocolate milk half full (we have a toddler so he tips it and spills it if its too full) and easy on the chocolate. She came back with a chocolate milk that was extremely chocolatety and had to be returned and a Becks instead of Odouls which she advised you did not carry. My girlfriend does not like Beck and she returned it. Not sure why the waitress decided to take it upon herself to bring something else. Next we ordered our meal. I ordered my sons kids pizza and asked if he could get sausage. She went back to the kitchen to ask and confirmed I could. Never did she say that there was a $5 charge for sausage on a kids pizza. Really? Almost the cost of the pizza itself?! Completely appalled by this! Next my pregnant girlfriend orders a Filet mignon medium in doneness. The Steak came out completely rare and had to be sent back. Later we ordered another round of drinks , specifically another Stella Beer. When she brings the beer to the table we immediately notice the color of the beer was that of a Blue Moon or Shock Top. She insists that it is the beer we ordered and after tasting it confirm it was in fact a Blue Moon or Shock Top. Returned the beer and just told her to take it off the bill. I had to ask her several times for straws she never brought to the table since my son had dropped his on the floor. I also asked for a refill of my sons chocolate milk to which she proceeded to tell me there was no refills. I told her, that when we sat down I told her to only fill halfway so he wouldn't spill and I would take the other half later. Once I reminded her of that she brought the chocolate milk. But she again just had a really bad attitude about this! Upon our getting ready to leave I stopped a manager, didn't get his name but he appeared to be latin or middle eastern with a close trimmed beard. I told him this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had and that our waitress had a really bad attitude and was not friendly at all. His response, let us know when you are back. I told him I wasn't from the area and I would probably never be back. He basically just briefly apologized as he was walking away from me and told me next time to address it at the time of dining and walked away from me. To spend almost $150 to have a nice meal and have this kind of service is completely unacceptable! Like I said before, we dine your restaurant often, at other locations and have never had this kind of experience. I hope as a company you will address this will all parties involved to provide a better experience for future patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=560,3.64,3.73,3.744,2.9520000000000004,3.6940000000000004

I had one bite, and was not a fan at all.  The texture of the noodles was something like Top Ramen , and reminded me of this very much so.  I was unimpressed.  Therefore I didnt even finish my dish, she only passed by to offer a box and quickly ushered my plate away.  Without asking how I liked it, I mean after all, she knew that it was my first time there and ordering a new dish which could be scary! SERVICE: She was nice. Prompt with drinks so no criticism there, but I was appalled when I arrived to my car and notice that she could have offered validation for parking.  Why didnt she offer this to me?

I came here with my date after watching Furious 7, since it was 10pm on Easter Sunday, many places were already closed. Thankfully there were a few restaurants that were still open so I opted to select Cheesecake factory.  There was little to no wait thankfully because I was starving. As we got seated, I noticed that the booth was dirty; there were still leftover food on the seat that I had to brush off, also the menus were sticky and the silverware was dirty, definitely not off to a good start. Our server came along and she was very pleasant and friendly. Certainly ended up saving the review to be doomed 2 star to 3 so kudos to our waitress.  Since it's been so long since I've eaten here, I hardly remembered the menu and oh boy what a vast menu that they have! Somewhere around 20 pages there is a little bit of everything here which I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. Want tacos? They have it. Want Chinese food? Sure. In the mood for some pasta? It's here. You get my point, it's kinda of insane. To be honest, I was a bit overwhelmed at the choices that finally after looking through the menu a good 2-3 times I finally just opted to get a breakfast omelet with sweet potato fries since breakfast items are my go to choice for when I can't decide on what to get.  When the food arrived, the portions were larger than expected which was a surprise. The omelet was at least the size of two and the sweet potato fries came in a huge bucket. My date couldn't decide either so she ordered the breakfast sandwich which was also huge. The food tasted as it should so no complaints on that end. The only gripe that I had was that the omelet was filled with potatoes and not so much on the meat side.  I only ate about 1/3 of the omelet because I wanted to save room for the cheesecake.

This Anaheim location is very nice.  Smaller than some I've been to, it has high ceilings and the typical decor.  The indoor seating is very busy and close together, but the high backed booths make the dining experience feel intimate.  Our waitress was wonderful- friendly and very fast despite being busy.  We were seated near the windows and had a nice view of Katella Ave. with it's tall palm trees.  The food was excellent quality, done very well.  It was a great place to have a fun meal talking with the best friends.  Excellent place for tourists to relax and unwind after a long day in Anaheim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=220,3.56,3.52,3.728,3.12,3.5360000000000005

The person who Answered the phone was rude and not helpful.  He wouldn't give us an estimated time to expect to wait or take our reservation.  We asked if we were there right now, how long would the wait be and he said well it could be anywhere from 10 minutes or 2 hours.  Which is it?   So we decided to drive to the location.  We arrived about 5:45pm on Sunday. We put our name in for 11 people and asked how long the wait would be. They spent 15 minutes trying to figure it out and still couldn't give an approximate time.  The hostess would leave the counter to walk around and look and then come back as clueless as she was when she left.  We ended up leaving and eating at California pizza kitchen right next door. This Cheesecake Factory sucked for their customer service.  Very disappointed.

All choices I've made have been OK at best. Not bad but not great either. I also believe that the prices are a bit steep. A snack from the snack menu, an appetizer, two pastas, and two slices of cheese cake came up to $79...that's steep. I don't mind spending but it has to be worth it! On the upside...the portions of most of the pastas are large and the cheesecakes are delicious (As they should be for the restaurants name sake).  I know of many people who really enjoy this place but as I stated, I've yet to find a dish here that completely wows me.

Girls Nite, Graduation Luncheons, Birthdays, and most recently for a surprise Mother's Day dinner. The service each and every time has been impeccable. Every server has displayed top notch customer service and even with larger parties we have never had an unreasonable wait time. When making the reservation they are very specific with letting us know that after 10 minutes they can no longer hold the extra seats. This has worked out well every time as I usually tell my group 15 minutes earlier to keep us all on point and allow for parking delays. My most recent visit was a surprise for myself and friends. Our husband's hosted a surprise Mother's Day dinner. We dined on the outside patio and the tables were complimented with roses. Simply beautiful! Our main server was Miguel and he was awesome! All the staff was great. Miguel simply stood out because he was so friendly and we loved his accent. He could upsell us anything. Lol!  Since this location is in a busy area surrounded by Disneyland and Angel's Stadium, the traffic is non-stop.

With the two so close together, we are one happy family! It's become our tradition to visit The Cheesecake Factory on Katella at least once during our trips to Disneyland. It's a great start to our vacation, as we anticipate spending the next day at the parks. On a recent trip, we left Disneyland midday and walked over for lunch. Although the restaurant was busy, it was a nice break from the frantic atmosphere of the parks. The food was as good as ever. My son loves the wheat bread in the bread basket and would make a meal of it if he could. My favorite meal is the  avocado egg rolls . On this visit for lunch, I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I also love. We like the variety offered on the menu and everyone always finds something amazing to eat. The service was good, as usual.  We have also found that this is a good location for meeting friends who live in the So. Cal. area. We can walk from Disneyland-area, and our friends can get there easily and use the parking garage. We say, ""Meet us at The Cheesecake Factory"" and everyone is game! The last time we came here, we randomly chose to visit this restaurant about 6 pm one night. We walked in and we're given a table immediately on the patio. The menu was huge, refillable soda drinks extremely good value. The orange chicken was delightful and all other items were enjoyed by family. The complimentary bread was very tasty. Miso salmon is always a fabulous dish here. We took cheesecakes to go and ate them for a few days afterwards. This was the meal that kept on giving.

I got the grilled salmon and salad as a more healthier option to what was on their extensive menu. The salmon was amazing as well the assortment of greens and vegetables it came with. My mother got the grilled chicken tacos which instead of a taco shell came served in a lettuce leaf. They were absolutely delicious (I tried one myself) and a great healthy option at $6.95.  Then we got onto ordering desserts. Easily one of the best desserts I've ever tried. The Oreo cheesecake slice we got between the 3 of us (easily a shareable portion size) was absolutely incredible. It had visible whole Oreos right in the middle of the slice! It was served with cream and covered in Oreo pieces as well as topped with a large Oreo cookie!

This evening me and friends dined at this location after a long day at Disneyland. We were tired, and hungry, so we were looking forward to a relaxing dinner. We were greeted promptly with the soup of the day and asked if we were ready. I asked the server if the bread had any eggs or dairy in it, since I am vegan and was given a snark response by our waitress that of course the bread has eggs in it ""because it's bread"". I felt like an idiot although I don't think she really knew what was in the bread anyways. I also asked for a straw twice and was rudely ignored after bringing only one straw for my boyfriend which she plopped in the water abruptly after several times of asking. She said that she wasn't allowed to bring straws for water, but upon request you should be handed a straw that is preferably wrapped. Our waitress Araka O. was our server and although she seemed to connect to the other couple at our table she was incredibly rude to me for God knows why.

293,Lisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,58,92.0,3.0,2015-08-22,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory, 3 times this week, and sadly each time I came they did nothing spectacular for me to give them anything more than 3 stars... and I even think 3 stars is me being nice but the second time I came here this week, they gave me great service. The first day I went here, I came at night with a large party celebrating a birthday. I have never been to this Cheesecake Factory because my go-to one is the Brea one. However, when I came with this party we were seated outside and the waitress, Melissa S, was very accommodating to our growing party. Melissa, was a good server. She was able to split all of our checks (12) easily without a hitch. She took our orders in a quick and friendly manner and she was even very keen on offering us a dessert to eat after she came out to surprise our two birthday girls.  The only downside I must say I had with Melissa was the attitude she kind of gave me at the end of the night, when it came to me asking for my Cheesecake to-go. I had ordered a Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake with the strawberries on the side, however, when I got my cheesecake, the strawberries were clearly on it, and syrup as well. I ended up telling Melissa that I had wanted the strawberries completely separate from the cheesecake because the person I was getting it for wasn't going to eat the cheesecake that night and didn't want the cheesecake to be saturated with the syrup and get soggy. She ended up showing her annoyance by giving me a long stare, then a little sigh as she said she'd fix it for me. When she came back with my ""newly fixed cheesecake"" all she simply did was remove the three strawberries and place it in a separate large container and give me back the already saturated in strawberry syrup cheesecake I clearly said I didn't want. Her attitude she gave me at the end was clearly seen by those sitting around me and they even mentioned her hostility to me. Aside from Melissa's downfall in service, the food here did not taste as great as other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to. The Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp was extremely salty. I drank a good amount of water after each bite because of how much salt they used in the pasta. It was like the entire ocean's salt was in this dish. Others around me ordered pasta as well and had mentioned that their dishes were really salty so we concluded that it must have been the pasta water that was too salty.  When it came down to the pasta sauce, this one seemed like it was missing flavor because I felt like all I was tasting were tomatoes and nothing else. The portions however were out of this world large. I barely scratched the mountain of pasta I got. I don't think I would order this dish again at this restaurant due to how salty the dish was overall. When I came back here the next night, I came simply just to get a order of cheesecake to-go and the person who had helped me and my date out, was so kind. I definitely recommend getting it to-go because as busy as it was at night when we had ordered our cheesecakes, we got it in less than 5 minutes. Amazing.  Yesterday, was the third day I came and I simply came to get cheesecake but instead of to-go, my friend and I decided to dine in. The wait to get a table was very quick. However our server, Carnell M, took a very long time to attend to us. We waited what seemed like 20 minutes before he took our order. It was a simple order no doubt but it is a bit ridiculous to wait that long. Our stuff came out in about 15-20 minutes. He came to check up on us once, and that was about it. His personality was an A+. He was funny, easy going, laughing, smiling and just all around had a great and friendly personality.  The only thing that irritates me the most is when a server hoovers over me when I am still looking at the receipt because they are so eager to get their money. And this is what he was doing to me. Carnell was pretty much was so keen on getting our check and pretty much would come back to grab that black book, even when I was clearly still reading the receipt. Once we were done paying and we stood up to leave, he came so quick to get the book. No thank you, no have a nice night, nothing. Just grabbed our money and left.  For the most part, this Cheesecake Factory has it's ups and it's downs but I want to say it has more downs than ups. All I know is that I think I will only order cheesecake to go at this one or just go to my usual Cheesecake Factory in Brea or the one at the Grove in LA, they obviously know how to be a bit more hospitable than this one does.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=280,3.6,3.53,3.628,3.1160000000000005,3.5580000000000003

We showed up around 9:00 pm and the place was packed. Since we were only a party of two, however, the wait was only ten minutes since we were willing to sit outside if necessary, which is exactly what we ended up doing.  I'm glad we did sit outside. It was a cool night and it was much quieter outside than in. We were promptly attended to by Jared. Upon request, he suggested a rather delicious full-body wine (i wish I could remember the name). I ordered the Chicken Madeira. It was a generous helping of chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was tender, not at all dry. I was not able to finish my dish so Jared kindly packaged up the remainder to go. I then ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake which as always was delicious. I left with a full and happy stomach.

183,Hieu N.,"Santa Ana, CA",275,85,1278.0,4.0,2015-09-29,"With so many items on the menu from Asian to Mexican to Italian to American, you'd think that there's no way the food can be top notch. I mean other than the cheesecake, which is phenomenal, how can any one of their dishes really be specialized? All that being said, I'm pleasantly surprised every time I come. Here's a few of my favorites: Seared Ahi Roll - RIP. Sadly they've taken this item off the menu. But I just wouldn't feel right not writing about this dish, because it was easily one of our favorite dishes here. We always ordered one for the table as an appetizer. The tuna was always fresh, and the roll lightly fried to perfection. It sat on top of a bed of crispy white noodles and was finished with scallions, a rich creamy sauce, and a light and slightly sweet ponzu. CF please bring this back! Steaks Diane - Hands down my favorite dish here. The medallions of steak are always cooked to the perfect temperature, and are always melt in your mouth tender. I have to shamelessly admit that I absolutely love A-1 and ask for it no matter where I get my steaks. However, the sauce that makes this dish is so rich and flavorful, I find myself using A-1 every so slightly. You can't forget about the mushrooms in the sauce either; with the sauce, it makes the perfect companion for the mashed potatoes. Jambalaya - I usually get this dish with rice, but you can also get it with noodles. I love Cajun food and this dish surprisingly hits the spot when I'm craving that southern flavor. It's got a nice spice, and with an abundance of chicken, shrimp, and andouille, I find myself only ever finishing half. Few disappointing notes - The cocktails left me wanting more. The pineapple Moscow mule was flat. I craved that crisp ginger beer that makes the drink so refreshing. The peach mint julep was difficult to drink. The chunks of peach are appreciated, but with the crushed ice and the mint, it was impossible to drink through a straw. It wasn't any easier to drink straight out of a narrow-mouthed chalice either. Margaritas, mojitos, and martinis are a little too sweet for my liking. With most cocktails ranging from $10-12, I'll stick to the food unless it's happy hour.  Tips - Get their complimentary bread basket. The squaw bread never lasts longer than 2 minutes at our table. They've got a really good happy hour M-F 4-6 with drinks and appetizers starting at $5. Lastly, the service is always top notch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=180,3.96,3.6,3.668,2.7359999999999998,3.744

Beyond cheesecake, I've never had a meal here that lived up to the price or the basic level of experience they guarantee.  In an effort to kill time and simultaneously fill my grumbling belly, I ate lunch here while staying at a nearby hotel. It was a slow Tuesday and one of the rare times I've been here where there wasn't a huge crowd. I sat at the bar. The bartender was a nice guy, chatting me up about my travels and making his personal recommendations. The unfortunate part was the meal itself. I ordered the ""spicy"" crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either a chipotle sauce or a buffalo sauce. I ordered the buffalo sauce. After an unusually long wait for the sandwich considering I was one of the few people there, it came out with the chipotle sauce on the side and no buffalo sauce on the chicken, as I was told there was. I asked for a side of buffalo sauce and was told the manager would bring it out. He did without a word. It would have been courteous to get an apology at the least for the mixup, but at that point satisfying my hunger was the top priority. The chicken and salad were pretty tasty, despite the lack of sauce.  The Cheesecake Factory is great for their namesake or a couple drinks at the bar.

For such an upper class restaurant in the Disneyland area, they are just decent.  SERVICE: Everytime I've been here the hostesses always seem to be very annoyed and distant when guest come up. I understand that huge crowds swarm in sometimes but the various of times that I've visited this location, they still seem to be the exact same. The waiters are a step up thankfully. I appriciate that they are usually friendly and helpful when under the pressure of so many tables to balance. FOOD:  I love that while browsing through the menu, fresh bread is served to seated guest! -Shrimp Pasta: Obviously different pasta plates use different noodles, but the spaghetti type noodles they use for this dish is a little hard. Luckily the more chewy, easy to bite toppings such as the shrimp and fried fish pieces balance out the texture making it a decent choice.  -Fettuccine Alfredo: is quite a deliciously filling dish! The noodles are cooked to perfection and the Alfredo sauce was pleasing! I highly recommend this choice! -Burgers: are huge and the meat is tender! A little over priced but satisfying and big enough to be worth it!

I will give it another shot somewhere else! The wait to be seated was over and beyond ridiculous, I mean close to 3hrs! it's not like if it were the ""LudoBites, Restaurant"" here!! We should of known it wasn't going to end right when the manger Luis Orozco told my boss (the wait is long, yes & soo what do you want me to do? Kick the people out to give you their table)yea we should of left, but some of us wanted to try this place out!! CUSTOMER SERVICE: needs to be improve sadly starting with management!  We were a party of 12 celebrating our Xmas dinner, with our bosses family, they specificaly explain to the waiter that they were strictly vegetarian and that there were some spices they didn't eat! All was fine ""soo we thought!""  He wrote down their choices he went back to the kitchen, came back saying all is okay, the cook will accommodate your group! Well after the long wait to be seated Guess what? Yep their food was WRONG! Shortly after the manger came out with the last two plates, and when he heard the food was not right, he gave the waiter the plates & simply walked away!! didn't come back! Then the waiter suggested to my boss to switch plates with his daughter?  When she already has started eating it!! This crew was truly Unbelievable I was dumbfounded by their clumsiness!  Yea that Luis manager never came back to apologize at least!! FOOD: was tasty can't complain about it! Portions were filling, but after the way we were treated , no one was able to enjoy the food. It was all bagged to Go At the end we ended up leaving our table & looking for a manager, since he never came back!  We explained to her our ordeals  since we walked in to that place! She was kind enough to deduct some items from the bill. Honestly I personally wouldn't of paid .

Well, everybody showed up around 8 and we still had to wait another 1 1/2 hr to be seated and eat. Totally ridiculous, considering that they refused to group together 3 tables and have us seated there. On top of that, one of the waitress made a mistake with the orders so one of my friends had to wait 30 minutes for his plate and......it was wrong too!! Very unpleasant experience.

We arrived pretty late when it comes to dinner. We arrived at 9pm.  We decided to sit at the bar because we wouldn't have to wait. The server was very nice. Made us some drinks that were off the menu. That was very nice of him. Here's where he messed up. Twenty minutes after taking our order, he comes to our table and asks us ""did you guys order""? um why yes, yes we did.  Another twenty five minutes later and we are still sitting there, waiting to be served. ( the waiter comes back and tells us that the chef over cooked the steak and they are making another on the fly. ) We had just spent the day at Disneyland and we were very hungry. My companion suggested that we pay our bill for our drinks and go to the room for a popcorn dinner.  I proceeded to the front and asked for a manager. I let the manager know that it had been 45 minutes and we just wanted to pay our bill and leave. He was very helpful and kind. I didn't complain to have any ill feelings. I just expressed our desire to pay our bill and leave.  The manager got us served in a few minutes. He let us know that the server forgot to put in our order. Here's what irritates me. I was lied to by our server and on top of waiting 45 minutes to be served, he didn't offer to take one single thing off the bill. I mean not even a piece of cheesecake.  I still left a tip. I know how important they are to servers. But I wish I didn't.  Good food. Terrible service. We went to IHOP the next morning, and couldn't help notice how much better the service was.

So just short and sweet review regarding the food since I didn't get to experience service or ambiance of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I got two cheesecakes to go! It felt like an indulgent night. There were so many delicious looking cheesecakes to choose from, it was seriously a struggle. My boyfriend decided on the dulce de leches cheesecake and since he chose such a sugar loaded cheesecake, I went with the lemon meringue cheesecake to add a little tartness to our palette!  There were both melt in your mouth delicious. Nothing less than what we had already expected. Seriously it just melts in your mouth. I believe they take it out to let it thaw a bit before packaging it to go, because it didn't feel like it just came from the fridge! We were going to eat it when we got home, but of course we snuck a bite when we got to the car, and it was fully thawed.  We got home and threw it in the freezer for about an hour. Personally I like my cheesecake more firm, and damn it did it justice for sure. The cheesecake had a great texture after being in the freezer for a little time. It was creamy enough to melt in your mouth but not too soft like straight up eating cream. The heat from your mouth melts it, and it is bomb. The lemon meringue suited my taste buds more and my boyfriend liked his better. I thought the Dulces de leches was a bit too sweet, it has a similar taste to caramel, and it has an extremely heavy and rich taste to it. I loved the lemon meringue, it was tart and not overly sweet.  I'm excited to try other ones in the future! Totally digging this place just for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=140,3.56,3.49,3.612,3.3120000000000003,3.5180000000000002

I have once again walked into The Cheesecake Factory. i was expecting it to be a little more nuts here being so close to Disneyland, but we had a great experience.  We had a group of 9 so we had to wait about 15 minutes for tables to be cleared. Not bad for TCF. Time waiting can always be entertained by gazing into the glass case of cheesecakes at the front. Deciding which delicious cake to have it definitely a tough choice - they all look so incredible! Service was excellent. Melissa our lead server was amazing. She got all our orders up quickly, kept the drinks filled. We got our bread and our oh by the way I need this added with no problems. After she even noticed our large group and volunteered to split up the check if needed. Wow. Usually you have to ask and then get the sigh from the server, but again she was very accommodating. She asked for our parking ticket too for validation.  The food was awesome as usual. I split mine with a friend because the portions are sooo huge and you do want to save room for some cheesecake. Turkey club was my choice this time around. Other ordered burgers and pasta dishes which looked fantastic. One of my absolute favorites is the buffalo blasts. OMG these are the best!!!!! They also have a full bar and great drink list. Only 3 beers on tap tho.  After filling our pie holes - we ordered up the cheese cakes.

But it just so happens that I got a nice sized gift card to The Cheesecake Factory over the holidays and found myself dining here this past weekend and I have to give credit where it is due. There was a horrendous wait for a Saturday night dinner but luckily, I had no problem dining outside which meant immediate seating... yay! To start, I ordered an app that had three fried items - avocado, mushrooms, and zucchini. After eating this, I have come to the conclusion that avocado should not ever meet the fryer, it just doesn't have the right taste. Loved the two sauces that came with this. Oh, did I mention this app was on the house--I told our server that they didn't bring our app out before the entrees so he apologized, looked into it, and brought it right out and said it is comped. Wow- this made me remember your name Garrett! For my entree, I had their miso salmon. It is served on a bed of rice and there are a few sugar snap peas. This was a very generous sized portion of salmon and I loved the taste of the sauce. I only wish there was more vegetables in this dish to balance it out, but I had no other complaints about my entree. Quite frankly, I was shocked. To finish off my meal, I shared a red velvet cheesecake. This dessert was not high on the sweet meter which made it a perfect way to end the meal. There are so many cheesecakes to choose from.

Came here on a Friday night at 7 pm and the wait was only 5 mins even though the place was packed. The front hostesses team worked well together and coordinated all the seatings. They were surprisingly efficient. I know the Cheesecake Factory food portions are large so we got a buffalo wing appetizer and a main pasta to split between the two of us. The server was perfectly cool with the split since I didn't want to get a doggie bag back to the hotel. I had a cheesecake slice for dessert. The food and the service were both excellent.

My 1 star review is for the kitchen, food and management.  - I happen to order the easiest plate on their 10 page menu which was spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatballs (lunch portion), easy right????! Wrong!!!  -On the first attempt I get cold tomato sauce over my 4 meatballs so I kindly asked that it be put under the broiler for a few minutes to be heated up, they take it upon themselves to redo my order.  -On the second attempt they bring out the lunch portion of my dish with only 1 meatball, so I kindly ask the server that I had ordered extra meatballs, again they chose to take my plate and make it again. -On the third attempt I get what I ordered, hot  spaghetti and 4 meatballs. So I dig in, the noodles and sauce are spot on, I cut into the meatball and it's as if I ordered ground beef tartare, medium rare on a meatball is not desirable or appetizing. So I kindly tell my waitress my problem and ask that my order gets canceled. -Management made no attempt to rectify or compensate me for this health hazard and for the fact that I ended up not eating because I don't like raw ground beef, all I got was a ""we are very sorry"" and walked away. I am sorry I didn't bring a party of 8 to your establishment to get a sorry when you can't get spaghetti and meatballs right.

We were delighted to get to enjoy dinner on a weeknight. We chose a chain restaurant due to convenience for the kids (kids menu, nice bathrooms). My husband had the pasta, I had shrimp scampi & steak, and the kids had corn dogs and chicken tenders. We felt the food and service was good.  That is...UNTIL the next day! My 1 year old threw up the next morning and was on a diet of Pedialyte and bread. We were thinking it was the pasta he shared with his dad or the milk he drank at the restaurant. After my 1 year old felt better, my husband complained of a stomach bug, and he also threw up several times. At this point I'm very sure it was the pasta they ate as it was the only thing different within the last 48 hours that my husband and son consumed. It doesn't end there, my 5 year old complained about being sick a few hours after my husband and on cue vomits everywhere. So 3/4 of us fell violently ill. What a coincidence... I guess I'm the ""lucky"" one who didn't get sick although I got to clean up a bunch of vomit. Gross.

164,Jackie W.,"Orange, CA",225,433,244.0,4.0,2016-02-25,"If their what seems like 40 page menu isn't enough to pull you in, then their delectable selection of cheesecake definitely should be. It's called The Cheesecake Factory after all.  This place always seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you can narrow down your meal choices, the food is almost always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy. On this particular visit, I went with the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, the perfect blend of spice, flavor, chicken and veggies. Plus I had plenty to take home for leftovers! I paired it with an Arnold Palmer (I love any place that serves these) and followed it up with the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake which is quite possibly my favorite sit down restaurant dessert ever.  The bigger portion sizes always equals a slightly heftier price tag. I think I spent almost $40 (including tax and tip) on the above but considering the pasta lasted me another meal and the cheesecake I nibbled on for several days after, it evens out. And you can tailor what your order to your price point by ordering smaller plates, getting water, etc.  The service was great. We actually ended up with 2 servers because we had a friend who joined us much much later and our previous server was no longer working. But one of the other servers very nicely took over our table and was super friendly. Make sure to get your parking validated. Your server can actually do it for you here so you can get your 3 hours free parking in the maze that is the GardenWalk parking structure.  My only complaint was when I arrived and asked if I could check in without my whole party there, the hostess said I could be seated without them. But when they called my name and they saw it was just me, they wouldn't let me be seated and put our reservation 'on hold' until everyone else was there which is fine, but need to give your customers the right information. I wouldn't have checked in to be seated if I knew I had to wait for everyone to be there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=140,3.88,3.58,3.58,3.3440000000000003,3.7

835,Noel B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,5.0,2016-04-22,"I'd like to begin with saying that the Cheesecake Factory is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to. This restaurant is utterly clean and it's absolutely gorgeous inside. It's very comforting and it makes me never want to leave the place. They've always greeted customers immediately after they walk in, from what I have observed and experienced. The workers here are extremely friendly, and sometimes I feel as if it's impossible to take a smile off their faces. I usually go on the weekends so it does get very busy, however every single time I've gone they've made my waiting time enjoyable. They do this by inviting you to sit by the bar, and throughout this time you have a waiter/waitress who takes care of you up until your table is ready. Once your table is ready and you've been seated, it doesn't take very long for a waiter/waitress to come over and begin offering drinks, appetizers, and helping with any questions you have. Also the waiter/waitress brings over such tasty bread. I wish I could take a slice home with me. The menu is everything you could ever imagine. There's so much to choose from, which is great because other restaurants I've been to your options are limited, or the dishes are all similar. Your food is out very shortly regardless of the amount of people they have. It's usually anywhere from 15-30 minutes and your waiter is checking up on you throughout this time. I would recommend getting the pasta carbonara",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=680,3.84,3.61,3.592,3.508,3.702
836,Kristin W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,1,,4.0,2016-04-22,"This place seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you walk through the doors, they always greet you immediately making you feel welcomed. Once they can narrow down the meal choices, the food is always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy.The service was great. When my boyfriend and I went there for a date, we actually ended up with 2 servers because our previous server was no longer working. But the other server was very nice and friendly. The prices are pretty decent. The bigger the plate size, the more pricey it gets. I believe that they food is good anyway so it's worth it. The negative thing about this is the place is that it's always packed (even on week nights) since it's next to Disneyland. The parking is a paid lot, but it's free with validation if you don't forget to bring your parking ticket. What I like the most is the cleanliness of this place. Everytime when I go use the restroom, there is always a clean bathroom and clean mirrors to look at when touching up your makeup or something.

When it arrived, the coconut and rice were dry, almost stale.  The chicken pieces were larger than usual, and a bit rubbery.  There were fewer shrimp than in other places, and the dish could have used two more tablespoons of sauce.  But the creepy part is that there were two rigatoni within.  I couldn't help but wonder how something so foreign got into my food.  Then it hit me that the chicken was not at all like how it usually is in this dish.  Did someone else's leftovers get in my food?   I just stopped eating, but because our table was basically having a reunion, I did not want the unpleasantness of speaking to the manager.  It was not a night for drama.   There are several quality restaurants in the same complex.  We don't live near Anaheim, but for those who do -- you will want to choose one of the other places.   This is not a place I would want to revisit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=220,3.88,3.59,3.588,3.0800000000000005,3.706

It was my mother and father-in-law's anniversary about one month ago and they wanted to go somewhere different. I suggested we go to the Cheesecake Factory because it's somewhere we've never eaten together as a family. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for our waitress to take our drink and appetizer orders. After our appetizer orders went in our waitress came back and asked us if we wanted to put in our dinner order. We told her we would like to wait for appetizers to get here and to start eating before we place our dinner orders however, she insisted that we give her our orders at the present time and she would ensure that our meals would not come out until our appetizers were finished. Unfortunately, it did not happen that way. Our meals and appetizers both came out at the same time which really upset my father-in-law. We asked our waitress if she could take our meals back and if she could bring them back when we were done with our appetizers. She told us that wouldn't be a problem however the meal my brother-in-law ordered was a steak medium done and she told us the steak would continue cooking if he didn't eat it right away.  I personally think this was wrong and rude of our waitress. It was clearly her mistake to bring out both our meals and appetizers at the same time when we clearly told her we wanted them separately and now she's telling us one of our meals will be overcooked if we don't consume it right away. This kind of service is absolutely ridiculous. I've been to many other cheesecake factories in my life and I'm never had service this bad before ever. I'm definitely going to think twice before I come back to this location.

In a nutshell, once we were seated the waiter hardly came around. I had to ask for our waiter to order food at least for the kids since we were waiting for other people in our party. The manager did take our order and the food came quickly. Once our whole party was there and ordered, it literally took almost half an hour for our food to come. While waiting the manager came and let us know that the kitchen was backed up and thats why the food was taking so long. When our food finally did come my plate was missing. Our waiter then asked if the manager advised that my order was dropped. The food was really good.

When you read the menu it seemed as if you were getting shrimp scampi pasta with salmon and mashed potatoes but you are not. It comes with salmon, mashed potatoes and 3 big pieces of shrimp.

I realize that this location is busy (all of them are) because it's smack in the middle of Disneyland central but to me that means you should have a better wait staff.  We were basically held hostage by our spectacular waiter, the guy has no business being a waiter or in any occupation that requires time management skills or people skills. I'd hate to see what that wait would be on a Saturday, we went on Wednesday.  Number of refills received at our table - 1, we had to flag someone down that wasn't our server. Number of minutes the waiter took to come back to our table to get drink orders after dropping off bread - 25 - waiter vanishes Number of minutes it took to get our drinks - 20 to 30 waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took our waiter to come back and take our order after dropping off drinks - 25 - waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took to get our food 45 normal for the amount of people but we didn't see our waiter for another 30 after that.  I dunno we would like refills now. No, no sign of anyone. Awesome we will all suck on the ice cubes. 15 minutes after the last appearance of our waiter, he pops back up and we ask for boxes. You would think we asked for his right arm based on his craptastic attitude. Sorry you have to do your job. Number of minutes until he returns - 25, again seriously WTF. Also all food is shoved in one bag for a party of 7 then says ""oh you didn't come together"". Asks if we want dessert- HUGE mistake. So refills...anyone...anyone..hey you random employee can we get refills now that our meal is over?!? Number of minutes it takes to get menus - 20 Number of eye rolls from the waiter when I ask for my cheesecake to go - 1 huge one. Maybe if you didn't take your sweet ass time I would have eaten it there but I really was ready to leave. Number of minutes to get cheesecake - 30....did he bake all them himself?? Number of minutes to get bill after cheesecake is dropped off - 28 This waiter could not be bothered with passing out drinks, he stopped at the first person at the table and stacked them all. He could not be bothered with picking up plates or even attempting to reach to get them, we all had to pick up the plates and pass them to him and when he brought the cheesecake he did the same thing.  No one bothers to offer refills, collect dirty used bread plates, check to see if anything was needed - you know all the basic restaurant industry skills.

102,Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24.0,4.0,2016-07-04,"My friend was staying at Anaheim Marriott nearby, so we decided to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. She's in town here and there as she's a flight attendant. She thoroughly enjoyed her last visit here, and didn't really want to try anything new.  There is a parking structure for this plaza, but make sure to get your ticket validated at the restaurants where you dine! Avocado Eggrolls (Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.) Garlic Noodles (Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Delicious Garlic Sauce. Available with Chicken or Shrimp.) Teriyaki Chicken (Chicken Breast Charbroiled with Teriyaki Sauce, Served with Steamed Rice.) FREE - Caesar Salad (The Almost Traditional Recipe with Croutons, Parmesan Cheese and Our Special Caesar Dressing. Available with Chicken.) TO GO - Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce.) This location does get busy due to the nearness of hotels and Disneyland but we were seated promptly when we arrived around 8 pm on a Thursday night. I have a few dishes that I always order when I visit any Cheesecake Factory, and that is the Avocado Eggrolls and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Never can go wrong with these two. Service was quite slow and we were starving. Once we were seated, we were looking for our server as we wanted to order right away. Took awhile, but we were finally able to order. We told the server that all the food could be brought out all together, no need for the appetizer to come first and then the entrees. So happy that they still serve the honey wheat and french bread with butter. So delicious! The manager did end up stopping by our table, during our meal, to let us know that the chef didn't approve of the Garlic Noodles dish they made and wanted to remake it. The manager wanted to apologize and give us an option of free soup or free salad. We totally were not expecting that level of service and was pleasantly surprised. We opted for the Caesar Salad.  My friend decided upon the Garlic Noodles and the Teriyaki Chicken. Both dishes were a first for me and I did enjoy the Garlic Noodles. The only thing that I did not enjoy about the Noodles was the Asparagus. It was not fresh at all. The stalk was so thick and dry that I was surprised the chef approved this 2nd plate for us to eat. It was like chewing gum. The Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet for my taste and the rice horrible, but my friend enjoyed this dish. Personally, I would not order Asian food at an American restaurant but everyone has different tastes. Since I was here and didn't get to eat my favorite, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, so I decided to order it to-go. Because how can I not? The portion was quite decent and the prices of all the dishes are always decently priced. Overall, my expectations of the food are up to what I expect from any Cheesecake Factory location. The parking structure was a bit of an inconvenience. The parking spots are a bit tight, so be careful of the cars next to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=100,3.56,3.72,3.576,2.9920000000000004,3.6560000000000006

My server was named Liz.   She properly introuduced herself and spent an appropriate amount time to accommodate us as far as wine and entrees.  When receiving my wine it was the wrong wine, ( That tells me staff doesn't communicate or aren't trained properly ). It wasnt liz who served me the wrong wine. It was another server. However, Liz expressed her most sincerest apologies and have paid more attention to my table than the managment team.

308,Kelsey C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,3.0,1.0,2016-08-12,"Seriously had an awful experience here yesterday. Before I write this just know that my boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry so we can tell if a server is actually busy or just being lazy. This was plain laziness.  We were promptly seated and our waiter took about ten minutes to get over to our table. We ordered alcoholic drinks. We were brought water without asking for it (which was really nice to be honest)! He dropped them off and went over to his other tables (he was being very friendly and attentive to them but for some reason not to us) and finally came over to take our order only to realize we STILL didn't have our alcoholic beverages. Went to get them and then took our order. And that was basically the last we saw of him. Manager brought our appetizers and noticed our drinks were empty and asked if we wanted a refill. The refills were then dropped off and we received our food. When we were done eating our server asked if we needed anything else and we said boxes and check. Takes him another 10 minutes to grab our plates to box them up and drop off the check.  Then we asked for our $95 check to be split down the middle. Takes him another 10 minutes to bring back the split check of $45 and some change each.  BUT, to my surprise today I notice that on my credit card i have been charged THREE times for this. $95 once ( I am guessing he charged my card in full accidentally and then had it pulled back without informing me.) Charged another $95, followed by the $45.  This is honestly ridiculous. It honestly felt like he saw two twenty somethings sit down who weren't all dressed up and thought, 'eh I'm not going to get a tip out of them so why bother.' He was so attentive to his other tables and not to us. I will not be returning to this location just based off this experience alone. My boyfriend and I work very hard at our jobs and we expect when we go out to eat to have a good experience just as we would give to our guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300,3.28,3.6,3.54,3.108,3.4720000000000004

As soon as you walk in the decor looks very nice! Loved it !  Had no idea you could walk in to buy cheesecake in the front entrance of the place where there is a little bakery shop sort of thing going on. When it comes to the noise level I'd say it was rather loud in there, maybe because we came on a Sunday?  Anyways we werent big fans of where we got seated because the table was very small but thats not the restaurants fault, we couldve asked to be moved but didnt. The waitress we got was beyond amazing!  She always checked up on us..almost constantly but not too extremely. And would never let my soda go more than half way down when she would come by and take it just to bring me a new full soda! She would take our trash right away and would take our leftovers to box them up and bring them back to us all ready in a bag to go, she definitely exceeded my waitress expectations. Now the menu has so much variety! Takes a lot of time to decide what to get, I would honestly suggest they add photos to their menu, I found myself googling images of their plates to see what I would be getting. I decided on the Madeira Chicken with the Steak Diane. I was pleased with the size of the plates, they were pretty big! My boyfriend ordered the Charbroiled steak which he loved and enjoyed. For dessert we had 2 cheescakes! One was the smores marshmallow w/chocolate cheesecake and Graham crackers, it was good, but i would suggest they add more crackers because the chocolate was just too much to eat by itself, it would make you feel all ""eh"" after a few bites and the marshmallow with crackers would even out the taste,thats until we finished that part. The other cheesecake we ordered to go, didnt eat it til the next day, it was the Kahlua cheescake which was THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! I would definitely go buy that cheescake again and again! It was just a perfect balance of all the flavors! Loved it! Overall our experience here was very good!

130,Russell S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,89,16.0,4.0,2016-11-16,"While in town for a conference, my coworkers and I decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory for dinner. The convention center is located in the Disneyland bubble with few food choices other than the large chains.  We had meals at two higher-end steakhouses, but to be honest, my favorite meal during the trip was here.   Our wait time was only 10 minutes, which is rare for this restaurant as I'm used to waiting 30-60 minutes for a table. Our server was excellent, probably the best I have encountered at any of the Cheesecake Factories I have been to. He was consistently helpful, refilled our waters promptly, and generally seemed to care that we had a good time. I didn't catch his name,  but he had a mini man bun about the size of a golf ball. I'm used to rushed servers trying to manage the hordes of patrons commonly found here.  For dinner, I had a dirty martini, fish n' chips, and a slice of Reece's peanut butter cup cheesecake for dessert. The fish was tender, which was quite refreshing as my other seafood meals during the trip were tough and rubbery. Despite being very hungry, I couldn't finish everything, which is a trademark of the huge servings here.  The martini helped me relax from the long day of sitting in uncomfortable conference chairs and we enjoyed our cheesecake back at the hotel.  Overall, it was a refreshing meal that reminded me of why this restaurant is consistently packed. Good consistent food with something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=120,3.56,3.59,3.588,3.408,3.5780000000000003

317,Gaby A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-08,"How does a restaurant not accommodate food for a type 1 diabetic? Let me just start off by saying I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. This specific location is the one my family and I always celebrate birthdays, graduations, and bring out of town family to. We've always been treated with the best customer service, which is why we always choose this location even though the parking is a bit of a hassle. So then why the 1 star rating you might ask? Well, my family and I came here right after my pinning ceremony to celebrate me graduating from nursing school. So this dinner was kind of a big deal. There was about 11 of my family members there, one of them being my fairly new diagnosed Type 1 diabetic 18 year old niece. We always ask for a nutritional menu for her so she can make her choices based on the amount of carbs she's supposed to have per meal. If anyone knows anything about diabetes and carb counting then you know how important it is to know how many carbs are in a meal so that the proper units of insulin are given. The item on the menu that fit her carb load for dinner was the lunch portion of chicken alfredo, the dinner portion far exceeded the amount of carbs she could have for a meal. When we asked the waiter if we could still have the lunch portion for her and explained why, we were told they couldn't do that because lunch was over.  As I said before we come to this specific location all the time, and they've done this for us before multiple times even if lunch hour is over. Why this night was different I'm not entirely sure. We asked to speak to the manager who also denied our request after thoroughly explaining our situation. I was entirely floored and to be frank disgusted at how the situation was handled. We weren't asking for the food to be made differently, we just asked for a smaller portion for ONE person in our party for a medical reason.  The worst part about this entire situation was the way they made my 18 yr old niece feel about her illness. Being newly diagnosed with a lifelong disease that takes major life style changes is hard enough for anyone but for someone so young it's harder to adjust. She had finally started feeling less ashamed about her diabetes and this was a complete slap in the face for her. She sat in her seat and silently cried while all this was happening, completely embarrassed for even asking. My entire dinner and truthfully day was ruined. This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner & an end to a good day. At the end of it they tried to rectify the situation by offering to comp us a slice of cheesecake. Really? I mean I understand their gesture but to try and give us a slice of cheesecake when the whole reason there was even an issue was because of someone who has diabetes is just so backwards. My family and I left this place so disappointed, we hardly touched our food.  I would think that for as big of a restaurant that Cheesecake Factory is, they would be more sensitive about guests who require adjustments due to medical reasons but I guess not, I would suggest avoiding this place if you or a family member or friend might require an adjustment as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300,3.4,3.56,3.604,2.6600000000000006,3.4960000000000004

I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in such a long time and was prepared for a hefty tab between my bf and I. We got seated within 5 minutes of walking in. What sucked was the host took us to our seat, which hadn't been cleaned up so he tried to walk us back towards the front again, only to have someone else tell him to seat us next to the seats that were being cleaned up. That new spot was tiny! We aren't big people but it was uncomfortable with very little space for anything. The utensils and napkins took up 70% of the table space already.  My bf was already not in a good mood because of the seating issue already but I tried to make the best of it. Took around 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and took her another 10 minutes to drop off our water. My bf's water was dirty but since she walked away we couldn't stop her fast enough to ask for a new one. He ended up not drinking water during our dinner :/  I ordered the pasta carbonara and my bf had the Cajun jambalaya pasta. I enjoyed my pasta carbonara (no meat) and my bf was indifferent with his jambalaya. For how much food we received, the bill was close to $40, which I think was overly priced. The service was what kind of affected us and made the visit unpleasant for us.

I've even ordered the ribeye in the past @ the Cerritos location & I would give that a 4* rating. However, this location's ribeye (the one I was served anyways) only deserves 2*. It was definitely the chewiest steak I've ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm pretty sure the cut itself was wrong, because it was very difficult to slice through. I was pretty disappointed because that was my cheat meal :( Although the mashed potatoes and broccoli it came with were both good. I would not recommend.

Second the food wasn't the issue the service was.   We walked in and we were seated within 5 minutes witch is great for a Saturday night so I was excited about that. You never m ow how long you'll have to wait to be seated. So immediately I thought ( great this won't take long ) it was 9pm on Saturday.  We get sat and our server immediately approach the table and told us he'd be right with us. So again I was thinking things are going great, fast to be seated and fast to be greeted.  So when our server returned roughly 5 minutes later we ordered our drinks and a starter. 20 minutes come by and we're still waiting on 1 drink ( hot water ) so finally we get the hot water and no starter. 25 minutes later we get to actually tell our server what we are having for dinner.

Not to mentioned out kid was super hungry and received his food 5 minutes after we got ours.  Oh and I forgot to mentioned it was his birthday so he chooses this place . Granted he just turned 9 but it was his choice.  Anyhow 3 out of the 4 dishes came out right but one of them was undercooked so now we're waiting on this to come back and I'm sure you've guessed by now that it took some time. I know this is one of those rants but again I was a server up to last year and I do know how it works and I know it gets busy but I also k ow it's part of the job to have timing down. Our server had a good personality and yes that's part of the job to get better tips but, what's good personality if the service part of your job is off.  Anyhow we just laid the bill and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=80,3.32,3.52,3.58,2.9160000000000004,3.4400000000000004

This afternoon I met up with my best friend for a late lunch. We ordered our favorite small plate to share and she ordered the chicken wraps. I went with our server's (Sabrina) recommendation and had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. Turned out to be best chicken dish I've ever had, and my bestie ate half! Like I said earlier every thing is good here, but the best part of the experience was indeed the service!  Sabrina is what a business wants and needs in its employees. She is more of an ambassador than server. She maintained a genuine smile the entire time, her recommendations were dead on, and she was effortlessly patient.

My oldest daughters burger was soggy and not warm. Mushrooms burned and she said completely tasteless. The burger was mealy and black. The entire plate of food was not eaten. My youngest had chicken strips that were more like tiny odd shaped chunks/ remnants of what used to be a chicken strip. Tasted strange and rubbery. Also went uneaten. My shrimp and chicken bang bang was underwhelming. Rice super dry, shrimp overcooked. i only found two tiny pieces  of chicken.  Our waitress was a ghost as well... Said absolutely nothing when she saw none of food was eaten just handed the check over which was over $100 with our cheesecake to take home.  Just... Blah. Schmer schmer.  Sooooo super bummed out.

It was a rubberband and it smelled as though it had gone through the cooking process with the rest of the dish because after smelling the dish more closely, it has a slight chemical smell. Aside from that, the noodles on the other entree I ordered to go were extremely overdone, to the point that they were slightly mushy. I called the restaurant right away and asked to speak to a Manager. She was apologetic and took the meat dish off my check.

We were both starving and excited to eat, but one thing after another, we were extremely disappointed. He ordered a burger and specifically asked for plain, minus the cheese, and everything else on the side, because he is disgusted by ketchup and tomatoes BUT ketchup was slathered all over the bun. He was mortified and scrapped off every little bit. I on the other hand ordered a salad, and the first thing I noticed was something brown. I thought, ""dirt??? No, no...couldn't be"" but lo and behold, it was. My lettuce leaves were covered with wet dirt.

He saw we were kind of just waiting on bread and to get our drinks order taken and got on that ASAP. Throughout the whole night, he was extremely attentive and helpful when we were unsure between a few options. Also really funny and polite. Honestly, I can genuinely say that he was one of the best servers I've ever had. Not just at Cheesecake Factory but overall. He was THAT great. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and really enjoyed it. Carnell said it would be really spicy but it actually was not spicy at all for me. I liked it a lot but I did initially want to ask for fettuccine pasta instead of linguine and forgot. I think the pasta would have been much better with fettuccine but that's just because I like thicker pasta types. For dessert, I got Linda's Fudge Cake and it was delicious. It's always my go-to and I'm never disappointed. Very fudge-y and heavy. I'm overall very satisfied with this dining experience, mainly because of Carnell.

On a corner, there is a lovely restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one at The Grove, The Americana, and in the Brea area, but... I liked this one a lot. As usual, there was a parking structure nearby, a lovely walking area, and lots of people, but it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the later hour we went! We were, immediately, sat down and waited upon. Our water and bread came quickly, our waiter was very friendly and nice, and we were munching away before we knew it. My date had the Hibachi Steak with fried green beans and mashed potatoes. He added on steamed broccoli, which was also delicious. I had the Farfalle Chicken and pasta and I've never tasted more juicy chicken before. The sauce wasn't overly salty, and the pasta was al dente!  Too stuffed fro dessert, we could only visually pig-out on their new items and many-item menu of desserts. I want to go back and just have dessert next time!! ... And maybe some steak.

I have experienced good and bad service from servers during my lifetime but tonight was simply horrible. Most servers are either really friendly or they fake it but  at least they try. Our server had the personality of a mannequin.  My friend was the first to point out that Ariel was the first server who did not smile. Don't get me wrong, she was polite but in a unnatural, almost forced manner. It seemed as if she was reading a script to herself and was thinking what a waste of time it was. She took our drink order and when she returned I kindly requested lemon for the water since she forgot to bring it. During our meal, she checked up on us to make sure that our food was to our satisfaction and ask about drink refills but each time it was such a dry and impersonal tone. I don't appreciate fake kindness but I would have felt more comfortable if she had made a little effort to be more human and less robotic. Everyone in our party felt odd when she would speak to us because she didn't seem to be enjoying herself in the least; it was as if she was in some type of physical pain. Very strange.  In the end, she forgot to validate our parking garage ticket so my friend had to pay rather than park the car and walk all the way back to the restaurant. All in all, we were more in disbelief than anything that Ariel was hired to serve patrons and we hope that she finds a new line of work. Or a simple smile would go a long way.

A little bit of crunch but still soft enough to cut through easily. Adds the right amount of feel to each bite. The potatoes!! In my opinion, they could be a stand alone dish. Comes with a side of ketchup which is just enough considering you don't even need it.  This particular Cheesecake Factory had a very open layout. Huge windows, pretty much floor to ceiling.

Regardless of the occasion, it's always a great place to grab a bit to eat. This Cheesecake Factory did not meet the mark though. My friend and I visited at 9 p.m. and there was about a forty minute wait. Luckily, my friend and I were distracted by the gorgeous/delicious display of cheesecake. I made it a personal goal of mine to try every single cheesecake on the menu. Good luck with that, right?  My favorite dishes at the Cheesecake factor are the avocado rolls and the burrito. Mhmm! You can never go wrong with these two choices. Plus, you get unlimited bread! So...why the three stars? Our waiter seemed a little bothered every time we ordered or asked a question. My friend and I only came to order a slice of cheesecake each. Once we told him that we were going to order only cheesecake, he immediately seemed a little displeased. I know it can get stressful serving tables, but we are still paying guest. When we saw him come by the table with bread, we asked, ""Is that bread for us?"" He promptly responded, ""No, this is for another table. I'll bring some later."" It wasn't his response that bothered us, but the way he said it. He kept this attitude this entire evening. Even my friend noticed it and she is a bartender! Overall, the food here is great, but the service can fall a little short.  This Cheesecake Factory is a great location, too!

She was very humorous and took great care of us! They sang happy birthday to my daughter and things could not have been more sweet. Kerianne was such genuine lady and the warmth she exuded really made my daughter smile.  The food and drinks were excellent. My sweet little girl devoured her bow tie pasta and I ""stole"" one of her delicious corn dogs (when she wasn't looking). I had the fish tacos which were great, and my mom had the omelette with a side of tomatoes. My mom is super picky and the first thing she commented on was the tomatoes and how fresh and juicy they were. My mom also finished every last bite of her omelette so it was obviously quite tasty. We also had peach bellinis and a pineapple mojito which were delicious. We ended our meal with a slice of delightful mango cheesecake. It was quite a treat and I highly recommend it!  I look forward to seeing Kerianne again and she really helped make my daughter's birthday special. Because of this, Kerianne is #1 as far as I'm concerned!

They got us in in 5 minutes! They have an extremely diverse menu. Its pages and pages long. For example, I got a dish with ahi tuna, my fiancé got meatloaf, my mom got a greek salad, and my dad got an Asian dish with chicken and rice. It was all really good. We also splurged for the grilled cheese (with truffle?) appetizer. It came with a tomato sauce dip. It was really good! Definitely something you would enjoy for a treat, it was pretty heavy so not something I would want every day.  Our waiter was really friendly, and made us all laugh. If there is such a thing as a professional waiter, he was it! He made jokes about my birthday, and we all had a good time.

To me personally, it's a standard restaurant and wasn't as ""great"" as I've heard. Don't get me wrong, it's ok - but I don't see what the fuss was about either.  And in all fairness, I understand The ""Cheesecake"" Factory is probably popular because of their desserts, but I didn't have any so this review is about everything but that.  Located in the Anaheim GardenWalk, this is about a block or two from Disney (depending on which direction you're walking from) - so expect crowds based off of that and on The Cheesecake Factory's popularity.  It was very crowded and we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a seat (my limit is 15, but I was feeling generous that day). We were given a choice of seating in which to wait for, but we wanted a booth so that may have been it. The place is also very noisy, so if you're looking for a quieter dining experience, then this place isn't for you. The decor......is blah. I wasn't expecting cheesecake wallpaper or something, but to me it just appeared bland. But small potatoes.  The menu was ok, though on the pricier end. I ordered my usual burger and while it tasted just fine, I've had both better and cheaper at the same time. None of us wanted dessert, so we got the check after the dinner. Maybe next time IF I decide to go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I will try something sweet or even a slice of cheesecake.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.

I had been trying to place an order for over an hour through postmates so our hungry kids could eat once we got to the hotel room from a 14 hour day in Disneyland. They were tired and hungry and the first order was placed an hour and a half before this place was suppose to close. The order was simple and through this app it tells you what the restaurant has listed as currently unavalible so we figured our order would be fine. My phone dies on the ride and the order was cancelled due to our inability to make a substitution. Okay that's our bad. So we place the order again this time we see one item in our order was marked as unavailable. Another 10 minutes goes by and the app notifies us another item in our order needs to be replaced so we change it, nope cheesecake informs postmates again that they can't fill our order. I order it one final time and within five minutes we are cancelled. I call the establishment at 1030pm, they close at 11pm, to see what is going on and am put on hold for 15minutes waiting for the cashier to pick up as she's handling takeout orders. I finally get her and ask what's going on and am met with a bad attitude and am being told that they can't make a cheese burger because they are out of kobe beef. They can't make any burgers if they are out of kobe beef mind you. So why wasn't the burgers marked as unavailable like every other unavailable item for the past hour and a half??? This led to the kids being forced to eat what snacks we had left from the park as they could barely keep their eyes opened!

Let's start with the complimentary bread and butter. It's hard to mess that up right? Well they seem to find a way to do so. Nine times out of ten, the. Bread the bring is cold. Who wants to eat cold bread? Not I.  Secondly, everyone I come I order the eggplant Parmesan. And when it's available, it it incredible. They are consistent with this dish. When I was a meat eater I used to get the chicken bellagio and that was incredible. But those days are long gone and I'm committed to this vegetarian/border line vegan thing. Cheesecake Factory is my cheat day restaurant. So lately all Cheesecake factories have been running out of the eggplant Parmesan. I still don't understand how you can manage to do that. So it's been throwing me off and making me think outside the box on what to order on their rather large menu.  Thank God I found a great tasting appetizer, the Korean fried cauliflower. Yum yum in my tum tum. Seriously! It taste like I'm eating sweet and sour and orange chicken. It's delicious. That's been a saving grace for me because meal wise, I won't order anything else on the menu.  Lastly, the dessert. Ultimate red velvet cheesecake is my go to. It can bring me out of a slump, pick me up if I was down and yea you get the point. They have never messed this one up. This is 5 stars all alone.

71,Richard S.,"Tustin, CA",1,112,,3.0,2017-12-18,"Stopped in because we have not been to a Cheesecake Factory almost forever. Food was good, above average. But our server must have gone off shift not long after getting our waters. Never saw her again and the other servers brought our app, food, etc. Seemed like service was spotty for us, whomever happened to see we were waiting (a long time) would come over and check. So 3 stars for OK food and slightly sub-par service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=60,3.36,3.65,3.592,,3.5340000000000003
15,Tarin C.,"Tracy, CA",44,1,,5.0,2017-12-18,Very delicious! My Boyfriend and I just got into town for our Disneyland trip. We were very hungry I looked up the menu for this place and everything sounded good We got there and boy were they busy. But it was no wait at all it took ten minutes or less to get a table. It was really loud inside so we sat outside witch was perfect for us. The noise volume was way down compared to inside. However that's just my preference some don't care about the noise and some like myself want a little more quiet. The waiter that helped us I sadly don't remember his name was wonderful he took our orders without even writing it down and memorized all of it. He definitely met our needs oh he also checked on us here and there which was perfect. This was a great place to start our vacation in the right way.  My Love and I will definitely be coming back here again on our next Disneyland adventure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.36,3.65,3.6,,3.5340000000000003
9,Candace C.,"Sacramento, CA",344,100,236.0,4.0,2017-12-21,"Always a good time at CCF, this was my first time dining at this location. We ordered the Korean cauliflower (omg!), veggie burgers and fries. The cauliflower y'all, the cauliflower. Order the cauliflower!! Perfect crunchy texture, sweet tangy closer to a hoisin type sauce. Even the non-cauliflower lovers will dig this app. I love cauliflower but you literally can't taste it lol but no complaints here! The CCF veggie burgers are made in house...who knew!? Enlarge my pic and you can literally see the beans and grains of rice inside. It was a huge patty, in fact too heavy and pieces of it fell apart each time we grabbed them to take a bit. I don't recall y'all the ingredients, but I suppose there was no binder (ie egg) to hold the patty together. It was fairly bland, but a little salt and pepper woke up the party. Due to the grains and veggies, CCF got a legit pass on the blandness due to all the goodness in the patty; little salt and pepper did the trick. Since the patty crumbles easily, spiced properly the ""burger"" could be crumbled and served as a meat replacement over pasta with marinara sauce, filler for veggie lasagna, tacos, burritos, or a mock meatloaf. CCF culinary development team, you're welcome for the plug (wink). Our server Andrew was personable, funny, and convinced us to go for the Korean cauliflower as an app. Good call, Andrew!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.4,3.64,3.596,,3.5440000000000005

Large menu with some great favourites like the Avocado Eggrolls...yummm! But the main attraction is the Cheesecake...obviously!  Everyone at our table ordered their own cheesecake which all tastes soooo good. Carrot cake cheesecake was the best, birthday cake cheesecake was tasty, the original cheesecake is simply a classic, and the turtle cake was also good. Once we received our cakes....everyone else around us ordered their own cakes after seeing ours...haha.  Overall great service and the patio was really enjoyable during the nice outdoor weather.

So it's my birthday I'm sick as a dog and have been stuck in bed all day, all our plans have been canceled and its an all around crappy Christmas eve. Such is life right? My wife wanting me to eat something and trying to cheer me up drove all the way to Anaheim cheese cake factory paid 12 dollars for valet parking and got me a strawberry cheese cake. She patiently waited almost 30 minutes for the cake. It took her over an hour to get home. Wakes me up to have some cake. I was very thankful knowing how far she went out of the way to get it. So she goes to cut it... solid as a rock, it is fresh out of the freezer. WTF who sells a cheese cake right out of the freezer with out at least SAYING something.  If we had been told, we could have had the option to order individual slices. Well now I am up and irritated beyond belief that my wife just wasted all that money and time for something worthless. So I decided I needed to place a call. I asked for the manager. Upon explaining everything he saw nothing wrong with the situation ""oh yeah of course it's frozen, you should have asked for a non frozen one"".... This is someone lacking in both sympathy and common sense. Someone deserves a nice lump of coal in their sticking for Christmas and the flu to boot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.36,3.63,3.6,,3.5220000000000002

2,Zsanette Z.,"Hemet, CA",1,25,29.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"Mesmerized by the tall ceilings and large open dining area, you'll be swept in.  You'll pass the large glass cheesecake display, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, and I'm sure you'll notice the, above top shelf, bar.  However, the glitz and glam will fade once seated at the table that is covered in crumbs, with spotty silverware. Your seat will have bits of food left there after falling from the table that was given a half-ass wipe down. The waitress will have arrived promptly. If you go, ask for Karina. She's attentive, polite, and friendly.  The food was average. Presentation was well.  Drinks were served in dirty glasses. The cheesecake, of course, saved this dining experience.  Friend ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It had a strong vanilla flavor with a smooth finish. I ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was a sweet and tangy explosion, with a coconut base.  All in all, I would dine here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to feast at this location.  TIP: Ask the waitress/waiter to validate your parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.52,3.61,3.6,,3.5740000000000003

1,Dr. O.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,1.0,2018-01-06,"This review is in regards to employee knowledge about parking validation at the Anaheim location, not the actual food itself. I went on Saturday, January 6, 2018. I met up with a friend I don't get to see very often and we ate and talked for quite some time. I got my parking validated at the front of the restaurant right before leaving and the girl told me it had a validation of 3 hours. I immediately walked to my car and as I was leaving the parking structure the arm didn't raise after entering my validated ticket. The girl in the parking booth informed me that I had to pay $3 for being 8 minutes into the next hour, which would make perfect sense if the validation was for only 2 hours, but I was told it was validated for 3 hours. I told her that the person at Cheesecake Factory told me the validation was for 3 hours and she rolled her eyes and said that, ""That happens all the time."" She said the validation from them is only good for a maximum of 2 hours and sooner or later they would hopefully start sharing the correct information with customers.  I called Cheesecake Factory when I got home just to let them know they told me the validation was for 3 hours when in fact the parking garage said the validation is only good for a maximum of 2 hours. The person on the phone told me that was wrong and it is in fact validated for 3 hours by them. I asked if it was even possible to validate parking for 2 OR 3 hours, thinking possibly the girl at the front just didn't validate it for the maximum amount of time for some strange reason? He said ""No,"" and explained that all validations are automatically done for 3 hours; that's the only option. I was thoroughly confused and asked to speak to a manager hoping to get the final, real story. The man on the phone put me on hold for a while before coming back on the line himself to tell me he was the manager (why was I put on hold, then?). He again confirmed that parking is validated for 3 hours and I told him the parking garage says differently. He said the third party who owns the parking garage has never indicated that the validation is only for 2 hours and they inform him if anything changes. I suggested he check with them because employees shouldn't be sharing the incorrect validation time.  I don't know if it's the fault of the parking garage or Cheesecake Factory, but they are giving customers contradictory information and I don't appreciate paying out of my own pocket because they can't get the story straight. I was also disappointed the ""manager"" (I'm doubting this is who I talked to) didn't say anything other than it's news to him if it's only validated for 2 hours; no indication of following up in any way. I won't be returning to this particular Cheesecake Factory if they can't communicate directly with the parking structure where you need to park. Very disappointing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.4,3.61,3.588,,3.5260000000000002
0,Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1670,147,857.0,5.0,2018-01-06,"Went here for my mother in laws birthday with a group of twenty two on a Saturday night. We had them split the bill into five different checks. They were able to sit us right away with a reservation. I've never been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory (besides the cheesecake itself) but this experience changed my perspective. To start, besides the quick seating which I already stated, the service was outstanding. They were on top of everything we asked for. The drinks were constantly filled, the food came out promptly and they did it all with friendly service. We had a small group come in a little late and the got them up to speed very quickly with drinks and food. The menu is so big with such a variety it's super hard to decide what to eat. I decided to go with the orange chicken. You can order full or half size and it comes with steamed rice and vegetables. I ordered the full size plate and it was absolutely delicious with enough chicken to feed two. I didn't hear any complaints no matter what anyone ordered at the table.  We topped the night off with, of course , the cheesecake. My favorite is the key lime but they have plenty of flavors to choose from. Definitely recommend if your visiting Anaheim and Disneyland!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim,3.52,3.61,3.604,,3.5740000000000003
