5,Lauren L.,"Dillsburg, PA",20,92,254.0,3.0,2016-11-26,"I understand this is a new Chili's that just opened up, so some mistakes are expected to be made. Besides mixing up some of our orders and forgetting to bring some drinks, they seemed to have their act together. I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Fresh Mex bowl. I've had it before and enjoyed it, but it seemed too spicy this time. I wished there was more sour cream throughout to compensate for the heat. Our waitress was very friendly, so I appreciated that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
9,Nicole K.,"New Salem, PA",68,7,,3.0,2016-12-26,"we went for the first time about 2 weeks ago, our waitress was very nice and attentive however someone who was in the kitchen screamed F--k loudly for pretty much everyone to hear.. just not something that should be done by an employee.. the food was okay, but the rice was hard on both mine and my husbands dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
8,David V.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,1.0,2017-01-08,"While visiting relatives in Uniontown, we decided to try the new Chili's. We were seated right away, and a server took our drink order shortly afterward. Then we perused the menus over and over and over for about 10 minutes because our server disappeared. She finally stopped by and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order. Instead she was seating people and waiting on people in other sections because they were so short-handed, and another 5 minutes or more passed before we were able to order. Meanwhile the manager who seated us stood around doing nothing. After placing our order, it took about 30 minutes to get our food, which was mediocre at best. The chicken avocado sandwich had almost no avocado on it, and the onion rings were cold. Trying to pay the check proved to be another adventure. It took forever to get our server's attention to bring the check. When she did, it was incorrect. Our order was combined with another table's order on the check. After that was straightened out and we went to leave, we tried to tell the manager about our experience, but he completely ignored us and walked away when we approached him and said we wanted to speak to him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
1,Jodi H.,"Nanty-Glo, PA",7,18,15.0,3.0,2017-01-14,Wait wasn't bad for a Saturday night. Food was good. Waitress was great. Felt as if they were short staffed. Would have gave 4 stars but bathroom was filthy.... gross.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,

4,Kim P.,"Elizabeth, PA",118,3,4.0,1.0,2017-02-19,Absolute worst service !!! Sat almost 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged our table.  The table next to us was there almost an hour and didn't have all of their food and our meals came before our soups.  The place was dirty with food even in the entrance way.  Won't be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
3,Danny C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,1,,1.0,2017-05-28,"Horrible, too much salt on my chips, no seasoning in my guacamole, ice tea served in plastic with 6 ice cubes, finally got my fajitas they were not seasoned and tough as card board, told waitress get me a check she said i have the manager coming I said ok, told the manager and he said really no other complaints, I said just give a check he said no need to and asked me to leave, I told him go Fuck himself he said he's taking my plate number and calling the police unsaid go ahead this is a free country so I called the police, asshole took my plate I said can ya read and reported that asshole, never in my life has a moron did such a thing when all i wanted was meal so he right. People forget the customer is always right and it should be constructive criticism not criticism. Smh never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
2,Jennifer T.,"Imperial, PA",2,1,,1.0,2017-06-25,"The service was awful!  My husband ordered chicken crispers with side of ranch and the ranch came 20 minutes + after meal was served.  When waiter brought food he said he would be back with refills.  We didn't get those until the ranch came as well.  My son ordered sweet tea and the waiter never got that right out of 3 times.  This is my first review on yelp, but this needed it.  Food was fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
6,David M.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-05,"Aweful! Love Chili's usually but this one does not meet the standard. Poor service, long wait for cold food.  Did not get the sense that the staff was trained or the place is lacking leadership.  We should have know that walking in at a 5:30 on a Friday night and the place was empty... it's to bad because Uniontown needs new options and this one is a flop..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-uniontown,,,,,
