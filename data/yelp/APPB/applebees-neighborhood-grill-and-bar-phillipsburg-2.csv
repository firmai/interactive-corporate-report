Andrew B.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",7,6,,3.0,9/27/2014,"I normally love Applebee's and never have a problem, but today just wasn't up to par. I hadn't been to Applebee's in a while and I only chose it because I had a free entree coupon for my birthday. So my parents and I went for a 3pm lunch.  We walked in with one hostess holding the door for us (as normal), but the other hostess didn't look happy or that she cared. She talked in a monotone voice and wasn't understanding that we wanted to sit at the bar table at the bottom of the steps into the bar. The other hostess understood and let us choose the table since the bar was empty. Our waiter came over and was hard to understand with his accent. My dad was upset that the normal Sam Adams wasn't on tap anymore and got a Heineken, which ended up being bad (skunky as my dad said). He got his new beer and we got ordered our appetizer. We finished our appetizer at least 5 minutes if not longer before our waiter came back to take our meal order.  Towards the end of the meal, the manager came over to check on the table and we ended up having a 10 minute conversation about the beer and other things, which was a nice thing. We finished our meal and went on our way. Overall, it wasn't the best experience at Applebee's that we've had, but it wasn't the worst either. I think what made me do three stars instead of two was the conversation with the manager. Also the food wasn't bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Ralph S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,5,,2.0,6/12/2017,"Applebee's is a save choice for a cocktail and food. Not fine dining, but that is not their business model. This was the first time I was at the Applebee's in Phillipsburg. I was not familiar with the area, so I used Google Maps. I followed the directions and it lead me to Route 22 and announced 'I have arrived', when in fact I was in the middle of Rt 22 with no clear sight of the restaurant and no entrance into a parking lot. After looping back and exploring both side of Rt 22 strip malls, we finally found our destination. There is no strip mall signs to assist in navigating the endless lefts and rights needed to get there. I would rate Applebee's a 3 stars, but until Applebee's in Phillipsburg addresses adequate signage for their patrons , I score it 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Bruce C.,"Riegelsville, PA",0,3,,1.0,9/20/2017,"This restaurant doesn't give a damn about 5% of its customers and it just lost this one. There are NO entrees among several dozen on the menu for vegetarians or vegans. ZERO! They have Mac and Cheese but it has bacon in it! I was relieved to find Black Bean Soup but the waitress told me it has bacon in it too!  She said I could have a veggie burger. Naively I said ""Oh I didn't see that on the menu."" She said, ""It's not on the menu. It's by request."" I settled for the mozzarella sticks (which they overlooked) and a side salad. I ordered a 22 ounce beer but so much fizz was in it that it was about a 19oz beer when it settled. I had to go to the bar and get it filled right. So Applebee's can't even pour a drink, cook mozzarella sticks, they do everything positive to send vegetarians from running for the exits. They love animals though. Boy are they ever profitable. Grass fed beef? Free range chicken? No such luck for the cows and chickens, who apparently live their entirely lives incarcerated. Applebee's, can't you even pretend to give a...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Lemuel M.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",6,4,,5.0,11/20/2016,"Came in to watch the football game and celebrate my birthday  and had a fantastic time food was on point. And Grace the server was Fantastic, Bob the local guy is amazing. I will definitely be coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Scott S.,"Wildwood, NJ",2,271,135,3.0,12/4/2014,"Just a typical meal.  Service very good.  The French onion soup and the broccoli cheese soup was just average. The French onion should have cheese over the bowl, this would make it more real.   We both had salads she had the wedge and I had the chicken caesar.  She liked the wedge.   For me the chicken was ice cold and should be warm Applebee's it's the little things that make people coming back.   Try harder",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Yvonne K.,"Ringgold, GA",30,190,53,2.0,6/23/2012,I have been to many Applebees throughout the USA...not that I'm a huge fan or anything but this one is the closest to me now and not a lot to chose from obviously in this neck of the woods especially if you want a drink! I can't remember ever having anything more than low average at this particular Applebees....The cocktails look nice on the menu and so does the food!!! Fruit juice...that's all they are!!!They couldn't make a corona rita...out of the pony size!!!My waiter was dripping sweat....the peach sangria was a waste of calories...I had to get up and get my own straw!!!I guess I'm still upset over the corona rita....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
D N.,"Asbury, NJ",0,23,,4.0,8/7/2013,"I'm not an Applebees or RubyTuesday person, but this place could be changing my mind. When I moved to the area I needed quick food until I got settled. Clean atmosphere. Consistently welcoming staff at the door. Good choice selection on menu. outside seating looks good (haven't tried it yet). The current manager makes a point to go to tables and greet people. Happy guy. Even saw him in the place on his ""off day"" and he was just as happy. Nice that his ""happy level"" is the same, On or Off work. They have TVs with all the sport on. My Golf is always on!!! Love that. They seem to have take-out you can pick up. (I've seen the parking spots for that) This isn't the place to get quality wine of course. But we all know that. :)  People visiting me like it here too, they ask to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Meta L.,"Intercourse, PA",20,24,5,1.0,4/12/2015,"Food was dry and tasteless.  I think they kept it in the microwave for too long and forgot to add salt.  I don't remember the menu describing my dish to be dry and tasteless, so I'm not sure why it came out that way.  Also, I was out of soda, so when the waitress came by to ask if there's anything else we needed, i thought for certain she'd ask if I'd like another soda considering it looked like she was looking at my empty cup.  Maybe she was tired.  Maybe she didn't care.  Plus it took way too long to get the food.  I bet they did end up leaving it in the microwave for too long!  Not impressed and not worth the Applebee's price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Brittany P.,"Philadelphia, PA",84,233,26,4.0,1/12/2015,it's Applebee's. chain establishment with the menu the same as the rest.

Polska Dzivka P.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",29,113,148,2.0,10/6/2014,The only time i visit this establishment is if my work friends meet up here.  Ehhhhh.  I usually stick to something on tap and a salad.  You cant mess it up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Patrick L.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,4,,4.0,3/21/2015,This particular Applebee's appears well managed when the male manager is working. His folks really seem to enjoy working for him. They need a little help teaching tenders how to pour Stout whether the Guinness or the new Sam Adams they have on tap. Let it sit before pushing the handle the opposite direction to release the nitrogen properly. Food is much improved. Service is good. The only bad I saw was when the female manager knowingly continued to serve someone who had way too much. The guy was passing out / falling asleep in his barstool. Pour responsibly please. It's not only your job but the right thing to do. Perhaps calling a cab would have been wise too!  A few of us at the bar were disturbed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Nikhil G.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,4,1,3.0,3/16/2015,Our shrimp in the scampi linguini was raw. Then we saw a black thing in one of the shrimp and returned both the shrimp scampi linguini entrees we got.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Tekwar T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,81,2,2.0,7/8/2014,"I've been coming to this specific Applebees over the years when visiting family and they insist on coming here. The food and service used to be really good years ago and I've noticed a downward spiral of inconsistently prepared food and inattentive servers. My recent visit included poorly prepared food, dirty utensils, and unprofessional management and staff. The food options aren't great in this town but only go to Applebees if your family drags you here kicking and screaming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
T P.,"Belvidere, NJ",3,112,,2.0,2/3/2015,"i usually like going to applebees. having said that, the last time i was there i ordered the ribs. i almost had to request a chainsaw to get the meat off of the bone. i have NEVER had ribs that overdone before. it was like they were cooked sometime around christmas and just sitting under a heat lamp waiting for some poor sucker to order them.  service was good, but you can bet your bippy i'll never make the mistake of ordering their ribs again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Diesel H.,"Milford, NJ",57,472,197,3.0,5/13/2014,apple bees always is in the pits. I only go here because its easy to socialize here late at night with friends. 1/2 price apps are great only when half off!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
Andy S.,"Washington, NJ",1,16,4,2.0,3/14/2014,"Like everyone before me, Applebee's is Applebee's. But, I would suggest not taking the pint glasses straight from the cleaner/steamer to the tap. It over-foams the beer and the customer is left with a warm beer. Frost them glasses!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2

Rodney H.,"Palmetto, FL",123,610,804,3.0,1/25/2010,"Typical Applebees, but really packed on a Friday night, before we arrived & even after we left the folks were queuing up to eat.We needed a table for 7 & were seated in about 12 minutes. The Service was prompt, The Manager even stopping by each table to check everything was ok.3 Kids menu & misc adult entrees. I ate the Sweet & spicy ribs which had a dry rub effect & were pretty good.Not my usual choice but a good place to eat with young Children",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phillipsburg-2
