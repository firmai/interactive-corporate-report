Gloria R.,"Ballwin, MO",480,478,3817,4.0,8/21/2017,Applebee's is my go to place for fast food on a budget. This location is always clean with plenty of parking. The managers and staffs has been nice and friendly to me . The low calories menu is nice and the price are great. I am always greeted with  a smile while showing me to my seat. The curbside services is fast and friendly! The (2) meals for $ 20.00 is nice and tasty.  The late happy hour from 9pm to close are great. You can purchase $5.00 appetizers with your favorite adult drink. I like the happy hours time during the week.( this is the best time for me) Thank you for providing good service at this location! I will return! Gloria~,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Jay J.,"Ballwin, MO",51,23,,5.0,8/5/2017,Applebee's is a total great hangout. The food is outstanding and the service is five star. If your looking for a good late night happy hour this place is the spot!! They always have half price apps after nine pm. The beer is always cold and the food is always hot. I recommend you sit at the bar and let Sean take care of you. He is a very good bartender and always makes good suggestions on what you should get. He does not forget anything. He will make sure your glass is always full. I recommend the wings either boneless or bone in. There both amazing. The place is very quiet so you can have a good conversation with your company. If your looking for a good place to relax this is the spot. Go see my buddy Sean. He will take good care of you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Maggi S.,"Grover, Grover, MO",0,2,,5.0,5/11/2017,"JOHN IS AMAZING. Such a good server, makes me want to come back even more. Everyone aim to be John.

Keith M.,"Ballwin, MO",0,9,,1.0,11/14/2016,"Applebee's lost my business because some college educated idiot eliminated riblets off the menu. They have no intention of bringing them back. Well they won't bring me back either.  such a dumbass to make a decision like that and the spineless managers won't speak up. Give it time, you won't have a job anyway. Applebee's will be gone within a couple years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
TeenMom2009 ..,"Saint Louis, MO",2,72,12,1.0,4/16/2016,"We tried to give this location a second chance and it was a big mistake! My steak was horrible and my broccoli was brown, they made a new steak and it was better. My friend ordered pasta and there was ""something"" in it which looks disgusting and I would not eat it! They said it was burnt chicken but I say other wise. It looked so gross! Our waitress did not refill our drinks. Our tea wasn't sweet, I asked for sweet tea and she brought us a un sweet tea with syrup from the bar and she said she couldn't make me sweet tea but she can charge me for a drink that I didn't want or drink. We also ordered 2 orders of cheese fries and it was like rubber cheese on the cold fries. Wasn't offered a desert and we were over charged and they had to adjust the bill 3 times before they got it right. The staff and management are the worst I've ever seen at any restaurant. They should hire staff that knows how to make a costumer happy and want to come back again and again but they clearly don't care about there costumers and only about money! 10 out 10 I'd give them a 1. The food was horrible, the service was horrible. I will NEVER EVER come back to this location! I love the other locations & I'll go to another Applebee's location but not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3

The gentleman working at the bar was very polite and funny. Everything tastes great and came out quick !

Austin Z.,"Chesterfield, MO",59,5,1,4.0,8/19/2015,"Food was awesome, we had the bbq boneless wings, spinach and artichoke dip, and two siracha shrimp for starters. Then we all had our own meals which were really good as well. The other reason i give it four stars was because lack of service. It took ys four minutes to get service when we were the only ones sitting at the bar at 5:00 pm. Honest mistake. I work in restaurants and i know somethings take you away from being up in the front, like making coffee or ice tea ir prepping for tonights shift, i get it. My mom had the salmnon which was awesome, i had a burger, and dad had the steak. Overall 4/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Jill H.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,9,,1.0,4/27/2016,This is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to in my life the food is horrible and the service is horrible and the managers are horrible The waitress is always trying to flirt with men customers to make her tips my friend and her husband ordered a sweet tea which was not sweet so she had them take it back and asked what other drinks they had and they did not have coke only Pepsi products so she asked for a ice water with lemon when she got the water it was water with hardly any ice and no lemon so she did not drink it. When we got the appetizers the wonton tacos were Kind of spicy so she took a drink of her husbands tea considering the waitress only brought a water with hardly any ice in it and no lemon and as soon as the waitressing that she kept coming back to the table asking the husband did he want another T he continuously said no but the waitress steadily came back and asked did he want another Tea even though he said no which was very disrespectful to him and his wife. Then she kept coming back to the table asking did he want a water which she said no continuously. Even though he said no she without his instruction came to the table and put a ice water on the table for him with ice in his cup and water unlike the wife. The waitress kept on asking the husband did he want refills and asked my husband did he want refills but never asked me or my friend it we want refills and then when I went outside asked my husband did he want a refill on his Bahama mama but never once asked me did I want to refill on my Long Island Ice tea. Me and my friend both had to ask for a refills to the waitress. She was a very disrespectful waitress. My friend steak who is not cooked right and had to ask to be taken back and then on the bill they charge her an extra $15 for the steak and it was supposed to be just a two for $25 meal her broccoli was brown and her mashed potatoes were post to have melted butter but did not have melted butter and his meal was fries and my husband meal was fries for the two for 20 and it look like shredded cheese that was melted and looked like spider webs on fries then my three cheese pasta had a black looking cockroach in it when I called for the waitress she said yeah it look like something gross then the manager came out and said no it looks like something off the grill but I was so disgusted I went outside because I was going to puke says when I came back inside well you want me to re-cook it no I don't want you to recut the same thing I wouldn't dare eat the same thing he says well what do you want me to do real snotty so I said well I haven't ate anything so I guess I'll try to take something home so they cook the four cheese macaroni honey mustard chicken tenders but when I got home I was so disgusted and could not eat I warmed it up for my kids and even my young kids could not eat it it was so gross and dry this is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to in my life don't ever go there the service is bad the food is bad the manager is bad and snotty and the waitress real try to steal any man she can because she so thirsty,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Stephanie R.,"Ballwin, MO",0,35,,1.0,3/23/2015,"I just don't get it. A friend gave us a gift card so we felt obligated to go. And if the beer was cold, how bad could it be? Well, it was pretty bad. I ordered a salad and pasta dish on the recommendation of the server. The salad was very pedestrian although the photo described a variety of vegetables. But the pasta was the real insult. The sauce tasted like flour and mayo and it was just horrible.  My husband ordered a burger only to learn the onion and pickles were chopped and included inside the burger. Not a good flavor profile. When he only ate 3 bites they kept wanting to give us something free. And there was nothing on the menu we are willing to try.  I don't understand how that place can be busy on any given night with the mediocre food. Don't settle America.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Kristen C.,"Ballwin, Saint Louis, MO",29,16,4,1.0,10/3/2015,"We went there again tonight and they have changed the menu again and it sucked. The kid's meals are a joke as well. All of the staff was rude and had a lot of attitude. I tried to wave over the manager four times while she saw us and ignored us. I finally got her attention by flicking her off!!  (I was pretty pissed by this point). They took off the kids meal from the bill, but they really need to clean house and hire nice people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Cyndi S.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",103,28,83,5.0,7/1/2015,"We haven't been to Applebee's in a while. We stopped in after my daughters summer school open house.  From the moment we entered we were surprised at the customer Service. We were freezing as the air conditioning vent was near our table. We mentioned it to our server Sabreina and she immediately took care of it. The manager upon hearing we were cold, turned it down. We were delayed in our ordering as the menu was new to us and again Sabreina answered our questions and was very helpful. My daughters fries were cold and without skipping a beat Sabreina with a smile said she would take care of it and wisked them away. She then came Back to share when we could expect them and within two minutes the manager delivered them with an apology. They then came back to double check everything was to our satisfaction. We will Definately be going back to this Applebee's and huge kudos for your customer service!  It's so refreshing and made our dinner very enjoyable.  Speaking of which,we all loved the dishes we ordered. Awesome evening!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Jay R.,"Ballwin, MO",0,22,,4.0,4/22/2015,"Well now that this is my new Neighborhood bar I figured I better get back in lest they forget me. Turns out Shawn was off tonight but a young lady, Kelly was manning (or should I say womaning lol) the bar. I can't say I'm really comfortable with a woman pouring drinks but it is the 21st century so I best get used to it. Well it turns out Kelly has the same intuitive judgment when it comes to watering down a drink. I like consistency.  Well it turns out Kelly's a local, went to high school right in the area, Go Mustangs!, and as she put it ""just kinda doin her thang"". I noticed as she was leaning on the bar she had the cutest pair of sweater puppies. When I commented on them she really perked up. It turns out her mom is always knitting this sweater material to look like puppies. I think these were supposed to be pugs.  Well I just popped in for a drink but next time I have to get the Kobe Style Meatballs. $7.99 for kobe beef! What a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Maris E.,"Kansas City, MO",8,6,9,1.0,5/15/2014,"Absolutely horrendous service. I had to call the server over multiple times to get a refill for water. My steak was very rubbery. The server took forever to seat us, then took forever to come to the table to take our orders, when we said we were almost ready he took a very long time again. I regularly saw him goofing off with staff, and standing around while we waited for him to come to our table. He left our table filthy with plates overflowing while we tried to eat around it.  It took forever to get essentially anything we needed and we always had to call him over because we got fed up from waiting. Wasted half of my day eating lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Jake R.,"Ballwin, MO",1,3,,5.0,6/28/2015,Food was great and the staff is amazing!!!! I recommend the kickin' turkey stacker.

Ann C.,"Ballwin, MO",64,93,5,5.0,7/24/2013,"We go into Applebees a lot for late night.  Last night ww were hungry and in the mood for Nachos.  I normally don't go for the nachos at AB but that's what the guy wanted.  Per Shawn the bartender, they don't have nachos on the menu any longer but they could create something. Create they did and they were better than any other!!! special ingredient? Chili I think. The rest was the same but they added a chille mix instead of ground meat! MMM...good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3

Jean P.,"Ballwin, MO",76,341,74,4.0,2/4/2011,"The husband and I got back from the gym on a Thursday night in somewhat of a food slump and still recovering from cabin fever during a recent snow/ice storm.  We had a gift card for Applebee's, so we decided why not? I have to say that I'm not pro or anti Applebee's, and I've been in quite a few.  This is probably one of friendliest Applebee's I've ever been in.  Not your usual high school student that hates their life because mommy and daddy made them get a job.  Very surprising in West County, and yes, there were ""kids"" working. My husband had one of the under 550 calorie meals - the asiago peppercorn steak, and I had one of the Weight Watchers meals - Paradise Chicken Salad.  My husband's steak was cooked as he requested, and the flavor was actually pretty good.  It was slightly on the chewy side, but I'm going to guess that's because it's a leaner cut of meat.  My salad was really delicious.  It's a salad with a fruit salsa and blackened chicken.  ""Diet"" or not, this was a really tasty salad, and I will surely order it again given the chance.  My only with would be that the granny smith apple pieces were cut a little smaller. We finished the meal with a brownie bite, and it was the perfect size.  Definitely a good idea if you want to splurge without completely breaking the bank.  And it was only a dollar!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
Kinsey M.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,9,,5.0,6/24/2013,"My friend and I went to a late afternoon lunch on 6/23 and I can't come up with enough good things to say about our experience. Eating out is always a challenge as I have two severe food allergies.  When I mentioned it to our server (Jessica C.) to inquire about the ingredients in a few items, she immediately noted my allergies on our ticket and offered to double check with the kitchen to ensure she was 100% correct on how each of those dishes were prepared.  She also went to speak to her manager (Thomas) to see what modifications were able to be made to accommodate my allergy.  Thomas personally came over to clarify what I wanted and let me know exactly how they could adjust the two dishes about which I had inquired. He also let me know about possible issues with the sides and offered up options. Both Jessica and Thomas were extremely friendly, helpful, and willing to adapt several meals for me without hesitation.  The meal I did get (lemon parmesean shrimp) was outstanding!! I truly appreciate the integrity and attitude of Jessica and Thomas.  Take note other dining establishments:  THIS. IS. HOW. EXCELLENCE. IS. DONE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ballwin-3
