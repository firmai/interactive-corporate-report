Krsna V.,"Arlington, VA",446,514,264,3.0,6/23/2007,"This was my first experience with Applebee's. The food is typical chain restaurant style. The major problem with this place is ventilation. Doesn't matter if you sit at other end of the restaurant, you can still smell cigarette smoke from the smoking section.  Service is good and the food is OK. Nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Ria L.,"Hattiesburg, MS",1,21,23,3.0,5/10/2016,"Average place for a decent taste food. We came here almost every week. Nothing disappointed so far. The restaurant atmosphere is good. The server/ waitress that we met were nice and friendly. The point is you need to know what you want, especially if you don't have adventures soul. Coz, their food may taste different from the picture on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Mike H.,"Petal, MS",0,1,1,3.0,6/9/2017,Service good. Food Good. Facilities could use some TLC with upholstery cleaning/replacement and wainscoting and baseboard cleaning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Master M.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,10,3,1.0,10/11/2016,This place has some of the most disappointing food I every had. I had a steak that tasted like fish and it just wasn't a good eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Tosh B.,"Hattiesburg, MS",2,31,7,3.0,9/25/2014,"Not very over the tops as chain restaurants go, did seem abit dim for lighting on the outskirts of the bar area. Ordered ribs and a large blue moon beer. Waitress was unsure of what was on draft . Wife ordered a margarita and it was served in a Tom Collins glass, very amateur bar tending their.  Overall I think it has opportunity to do better but lacks anything now that would tempt me to go their over chilis....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Janice M.,"Collins, MS",40,5,5,1.0,4/16/2016,There was a 10 minute way but only three other sets of individual were in there. Then once seated we waiting another 5+ minutes to order drinks. Finally when I got my food it was cold. To top it off we were seated across from some kids and one of the vomited in her plate. Worse experience ever. I won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
LeAnne W.,"Petal, MS",2,4,,2.0,10/17/2015,It's always hit or miss for this Applebees.... The service will be great and the food will be subpar or the staff will be off in their own worlds and the good will be GREAT but your treatment will leave a bad aftertaste. Maybe I'm just cynical? I don't know. But my trips here have been disappointing 7 out of 10 times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Marlon M.,"Honolulu, HI",102,35,14,4.0,2/7/2016,"Our server Joseph was awesome, he knew the menu & suggested things to us, the food is always good especially the low carb meals. They are always switching up the menu with some great new items I love to try. The appetizers are always the best. Should come here more but only during daylight hours. It gets really rowdy & unorganized at night from my previous experiences. Love the drinks but not a fan of the night time atmosphere. I recommend lunch here, but thats good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Christie - Matt R.,"Houston, TX",8,32,4,1.0,7/30/2014,"Walked in and no one greeted me. Then grabbed a menu and sat myself and no recognition by any staff walking by for five minutes. Finally, someone asked if I'd had my drink order taken. Two minutes later my waitress showed up and said, what would you like? I said, salmon. She added, is that it? I added the French onion soup.  My Sam Adams ale then arrived. It was cloudy and tasted nothing like it should. However, the manager replaced it with another beer in their selection. My salmon arrived, not great but not bad either. Then my soup, simply okay there. As the last morsel of food entered my mouth the waitress returned, asking, everything okay baby?  This restaurant in desperate need of PR training, beyond the MOD, an Asian guy who sounded like Elvis they're sorely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Chris S.,"Hattiesburg, MS",3,7,,2.0,7/12/2014,"My first visit here since four years ago.i remember why I don't like it.the customer service was great,our waiter was very attentive and courteous.but the food.smh I ordered a spinach dip.got the food within a reasonable time but it was nothing special,I actually felt kind of insulted by the portion size i recieved becuase it was so small.their was more cream than actual spinach in the dish.i wouldn't recommend eating here.not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Chris S.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,19,23,1.0,4/26/2015,They have small portions and high prices.i wasn't impressed.the spinach dip was very soupy almost thought it was soup when they brought it to the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Jennie K.,"Austin, TX",152,448,1016,2.0,12/21/2010,"Bleh.  This just confirms I don't like Applebee's.  I ordered a small steak medium well, and it came out overly well done.  On top of that, the mashed potatoes were inedible, the veggies were soggy probably from being over microwaved, and the steak was wayyy too salty.  The mozzarella sticks were not even hot enough for the cheese to get gooey.  The redeeming factor was the Fiesta Lime Chicken was very tangy and flavorful.  I swapped my friend for his dish. This visit was just a hazard of late-night dinners on a road trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Heather B.,"Pelham, AL",135,6,,2.0,3/15/2014,Mediocre food and terrible service. Tiny veggie portion w my steak. Sat here 10-15 mins w empty drinks even after asking other employees to find our server. Black n blue burger was awful. Chicken tenders overdone and dry. Ran out of Mr. Pibb.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Tracey W.,"Brandon, MS",12,75,22,2.0,4/17/2011,Bourbon street chicken/shrimp wasn't as good as it looked. My.neice and husband tried ketchup but that couldn't even make it !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Hope B.,"Southaven, MS",0,1,,5.0,11/21/2013,Ever since they got their new gm things have gotten sooo much better. I especially love the new weight watchers items. Also their happy hour specials are amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Allison R.,"New Orleans, LA",156,214,9,1.0,9/27/2010,I cannot stand this Applebee's.  It was this restaurant that turned me away from the whole chain.  There was paper in my food and the waitress could have cared less.  They take forever to bring your food out and the drinks at the bar kind of suck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
Ashton L.,"New Orleans, LA",0,15,3,1.0,12/12/2010,"This particular Applebee's is consistently terrible. The last few visits were bad because on one occasion, my take-out quesadilla burger patty was nearly raw. Another, the boneless wings were still partially frozen (again, take-out but I live VERY CLOSE) and the left one of the sides of our dinners off, as well as the ice cream from our dessert was amiss. Most recently - this weekend in restaurant - my spouse's food tasted like it was poured out of a bag (It probably was), and my NY Strip was certainly no strip and it was cooked in a pan or a griddle. It tasted exactly like hamburger meat, which led us both to figure it was really a oddly cut sirloin. It was also overcooked and had a strange texture, possibly freezer burnt? When the manager asked about the looks on our faces, my spouse told him that my steak was just as I described above - he argued a bit about it being cooked with the same hamburger spices and on the same grill, when my husband laughed and told him it was DEFINITELY not cooked on a grill. The manager half-heartedly apologized and offered something else, but by then I was too disgusted to want it. The waitress was so friendly to all her other tables EXCEPT ours, when she walked to us she acted as if we disgusted her. She was impatient, rude, and when thanked, her response was ""uh huh."" I'll not be back, except to take out a maple butter blondie. :-P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hattiesburg-3
