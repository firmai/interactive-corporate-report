93,Sarah F.,"Washington, DC",0,15,,2.0,2012-06-17,"The restaurant has only been open for about a week, and we went on Fathers' Day, so it was very busy. The service was terrible. We were seated and got our drink orders in a timely fashion, and we ordered our food not too long after we had gotten there.  However, we then had to wait for almost an hour for our food to arrive (there were six of us). When it arrived, two of the orders had something wrong (wrong side, incorrectly cooked) and one was missing. Two more were, while not cold, not hot either. We then had to wait another ten minutes for the missing order to arrive, and it arrived only after we had spoken to a manager about that and the incorrectly-cooked steak.  The food was quite good, if a little cold, and I expect that many of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant ages. I will say that the manager was very helpful once we spoke to him and he discounted our check to compensate for our trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001
103,Michelle R.,"Waco, TX",0,11,,5.0,2012-06-18,"My husband and I went to BJ'S on Saturday after opening.  It was terribly crowded, but once we got in, the service was great.  Even though our food was late, our waiter took it upon himself to check on the food 2 times, obviously since they'd been open less than a week, there were the opening problems and having such large crowds.  So, we understand.  The tables were smaller than usual, so I guess they could fit more people in. Now, the food and drink.  I had the B.J.'s P.M. Porter, and it was the best dark beer I've ever had, smooth and rich, and went perfectly with my food.  My husband had the Nutty Brewnette which was good, but more bitter than I like in a dark beer. Spinach-stuffed mushrooms, they needed to bring out a smaller serving dish as it made the mushrooms look even smaller.  But they were delicious. I ordered the knife and fork sandwich,  ""Piranha, Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger.  The beef tasted of the highest grade, and my medium-well grill was perfect.  The chili was also very tasty.  I would order this again. My husband had the chicken fried steak, he said it was better than anything he's had in Waco, and I sampled the gravy, and although they didn't bring enough for a chicken fried steak, it was really good, and if it was a mix, they disguised it well, because it tasted homemade. All in all a good experience, more expensive than the usual places we visit, but worth it to save to go here.  I think the noise and the longer wait for food with get better with time.  I hope the food stays as good as it is!  So for now, 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=100,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.1560000000000006
75,Tony B.,"Belton, TX",51,19,14.0,5.0,2012-06-19,"With any brand new opening of a big chain like this there are bound to be hiccups. I was pleasantly surprised at the complete and total lack of these hiccups on my first visit to the newly constructed BJ's in Waco. There was about a 10 minute wait around 1pm which isn't a huge deal. We had apparently just missed the huge lunch rush. From the moment I walked in the door every single hostess, waiter/waitress, buster, and bartender put off a vibe that they wanted to be there and wanted to make sure I left happy. Dominique (hopefully that's spelled correctly!) did an outstanding job as our waitress. She used the perfect balance of making sure our glasses never went less than half full, but not checking on us to the point of being annoying.  We got the avocado egg-rolls as an appetizer. I'm sure you hear people say this about many of the menu items here, but as crazy as it sounds it's actually quite delicious! Dipping them in the provided sauce is a must. I also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup which they actually bring out in two separate containers. The plate has a small pile of shredded tortilla chips, avocado, a lime wedge, and some seasonings. They then pour the soup over the small pile so when you eat it the tortilla chips are still slightly crunchy. It had an awesome slightly spicy flavor. I also had the light chicken tacos which were also quite tasty. Their signature desert is essentially a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice-cream on top which was delicious as well. Wow... after re-reading this I sound like a huge fatty! The wait time for the food was surprisingly short given the large volume of people in the restaurant. I also take every chance I get to try new beers, and got the Hopstorm. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did the Porter I tried at my last visit to BJ's in Temple, but I'm not really much of an IPA guy. They have over a dozen (i think?) of their own brews. If you want to try a bunch of them you can build a sampler which I highly recommend. I'm glad to see some fresh competition for all the other big chains in Waco. I have no doubt this place will give them a run for their money. Definitely plan on making myself a regular here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005
76,Edie J.,"Waco, TX",1,29,,5.0,2012-06-23,"I went here for the first time today and I was very happy with my experience. The wait time was shorter than estimated and the waitress was very friendly. The food was amazing. It was filling without making me feel weighed down. Even with a dessert. the pizza was actually loaded with lots of the toppings. Normally you'd think you'd find a few here and there and have it mostly be cheese. Not here. There was so many toppings that they were falling off the plate and I was eating them with my fork.  The only downside was that the hostess who showed us to our table was a tad creepyish. She walked really slow and was a bit robotic.  Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely plan on going back. Maybe once it slows down a little.

Being from the Dallas FT Worth area, I'm no stranger to this chain of restaurant.  Like any other location, they keep it very open space. The food here is great, especially during lunch time. You can easily get a full stomach for under 13 bucks, and that's including tips! (during lunch time that is) Prices are moderately high on regularly price items, but the portion are more than enough. Most people end up leaving with to go boxes.  My favorite menu item would be their Thai Chicken Wontons. They offer it here at this location, but not to the one in Arlington, Texas.

73,David L.,"Waco, TX",2,10,,1.0,2012-09-16,"I don't usually rate restaurants this low, but my experience at this particular BJ's in Waco, Texas was not even remotely pleasant. I went to BJ's on September 16, 2012 with a group of friends. My friend recommended it based upon his experiences with another BJ's in Sugarland, Texas. He said that they were well known for their pizza, so we decided to order some pizzas, three in fact. After receiving our pizzas, however, we were not impressed in any way. Not only was the pizza not ""deep-dish"" as the menu proclaimed, but its quality looked very average, on par with Pizza Hut. Normally, I wouldn't complain too much, but the pizza cost $20. I could get the same pizza for $10 at Pizza Hut. There were mistakes in the cooking of the pizza, there were parts of the pizza, like the onions, that were still raw. However, our group recognized that mistakes do happen. We decided to just inform the waitress instead, just to express our concern. The service, however, was not great at all. Even though the restaurant has only been open for a month or two, it should be well established by now, but the manager kept giving us odd excuses for the conditions of our pizzas. He stated that they no longer serve their pizzas in a pan, but instead serve them on a dish because it ""keeps the pizza warmer for longer"", which makes little sense to me. Not only that, he stated later on that the pizzas we received were indeed deep dish. I'm from Chicago, and I know that that was not a deep dish pizza. The tomato sauce was not on the top, and the pizza was by no means thick enough. The manager seemed to give us excuses and lies, which I don't understand. He did not seem to like our constructive criticism, but instead seemed to become defensive. In the end, they gave us a discount on the meal, which I respect, but with that bad combination of service and quality. I don't think I'll be coming back. This is not to say the franchise is bad, but this particular chain, I would avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372
102,Jeff T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,14.0,1.0,2012-09-16,"I have been to BJ's back at home in houston, tx. The deep dish pizzas were actual deep dish pizzas like the one on the photo on their home page.  well the deep dish pizzas we received at this BJ's looked like a take out pizza that came from pizza hut. It tasted like COLD oily cardboard with no sauce.  the waiter did not even offer the option of steak fries for fish and chips. Instead they decided to serve a classic English dish with skinny fries that were cold.  We asked for the manager and I addressed the issues about how the pizzas are not the same as the other BJ's I have been to. He told me ""this is how they are supposed to be made and they were always like this."" After I told him I just went to the BJ's at home 1 month ago, he tells me ""we changed that 1 month ago.""  What did not make sense to me was the manager told me that they cook their deep dish pizzas in the original deep dish containers, but they transfer the pizza to a plate because it ""keeps it warmer.""  I went onto the website for BJ's to find the corporate contact information, and the front page photo was a picture of a waiter holding a deep dish pizza by a clamp just as I described it to the manager.  My total dining time was 2 hours.  This place is not the same as other BJ's. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE.

95,David L.,"Waco, TX",223,869,119.0,4.0,2013-04-16,"The 'neighborhood' bar & grill concept has entered a new era, catering to those who tire of burger-based menus, tacky things on walls, and mass-produced beers. They still want a place to watch the game, but they want to feel grown up doing it. Restaurants like BJ's, Gordon Biersch, and Dogfish Head are seeking to fill this glorified sports bar niche. BJ's brings together Americans' newfound taste for microbrews and their enduring appetite for Chicago-style deep dish pizza in what amounts to a franchised gastropub. Of course, there's a full menu to accommodate everyone's tastes, but beer and pizza serve as the backbone. The aesthetic is reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory-style opulence, featuring dark woods, high ceilings, and a large bar with backlit liquor bottles. Kitschy memorabilia are here forgone in favor of a large corporate mural of nondescript yeoman farmers growing wheat and making beer. The bar has a massive four-picture television, and smaller screens are tastefully interspersed throughout the rest of the restaurant. We enjoyed the starter Caesar (creamy with a slight zip), the spicy sausage deep dish (the heat builds nicely), and their 'Pizookie,' which is a rather hokey name for a miniature hot cookie pie topped with ice cream.

I've been there about five times in the past year and I have yet to have great service. I've had good service but they always seem to be in a rush, half zoned-out, and slow on refills. The food is also getting bad. I ordered a Cesar salad with grilled chicken and the chicken was burned to a crisp. It took so long to get it that I didn't bother correcting it. Another day, I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The marinara sauce was so spicy that I had to stop eating and give the rest to my boyfriend. I am VERY sensitive to spice and did not expect that with an Italian dish. I've watched the movie Waiting too many times to complain about food and, once again, I was Starvin' Marvin when I received my food. (Yes, I'm a wimp).

39,Jennifer T.,"Fayetteville, AR",1,2,2.0,1.0,2014-01-19,"BJ's is what it is, a chain restaurant where you can expect to have the same experience from one location to the next. One of the only exceptions of course is customer service. We visited tonight, a Sunday evening, around 8:30-8:45ish. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us, understandable to a degree with two large tables of college students still being waited on right next to us. However, our waitress Ashley was unapologetic about her slowness to greet us or get our drink order. We told her we were actually ready to order everything, aware that we might not have another opportunity to do so for a while later and to make things easier on her since she was obviously having a rough night. Long story short, she continued to be flippant and cold towards us the rest of the evening with intermittent moments of kindness for instance after we had to seek out silverware and later when the bill arrived of course. In summary, I'm only writing this review to make the management aware of this behavior of a staff member.

The last time we were in the food and service was terrible.  I was so disappointed and to top it off my family was in town and all I did before the visit was rave about how good this place is.  We got our appetizer, and after realizing something huge was missing off of the plate, we realized it was the chips for the dip.  Service just dropped the plate off and left, not explaining why were weren't given chips for our dip (that I also happened to RAVE about.) so instead when our server came we were left to ask about it, and he explained that they were out of chips.  Oh, ok. Well, can we have something ELSE to use the dip with? They wanted to charge us for bits of bread, then we settled on a few ""breadsticks"" they use for pasta for free.  seriously. We just blew 17$ on this appetizer and there are no chips, and the rest of the appetizer was luke warm...  Once I got my plate of food, my fries were cold, and my burger was also luke warm.  I asked for more fries for my plate but by the time they got there I was half way through my burger.  My parents plates and my husbands weren't much better, and we were left looking like chumps for saying this place was so great.

Long wait between being seated and greeted, drink refills were rare, etc.  When at BJ's we always get the avocado egg roll appetizer. Yum.  The husband and I both ordered Cajun dishes this time, and it is clear that the kitchen didn't truly understand Cajun food. All the right elements and flavors were there, but both dishes lacked that little oomph that makes Cajun so special.  The biggest reason I cannot give BJ's the fourth star is inconsistency. Some of their dishes on the menu are decidedly above-average. Their ahi tuna salad, for example, is (was? It's been a while since we've ordered one) stellar. Sadly, other dishes are just average.

We waited for about 15 minutes to get another drink ordered, and another 10 to order our food. We then spent the next 40 minutes waiting on our food that we ordered. (Mind you still soaking wet with the drink that had spilled on me.) The waitress never checked on us, until we were ready to just go. Then told us that the food we ordered takes 20 minutes to cook, which is fine but we had ordered it 40 minutes prior. I told her we were pretty much ready to leave money on the table and walk out, she walked away and said she was sorry while looking the other way.  Then promptly walked back to continue to converse with the table behind us.

74,KG P.,"Waco, TX",0,3,,1.0,2015-08-17,"We had a party of group of 11 at BJ's to celebrate a birthday. It was my nephews 21st birthday, and since he enjoys BJ's pizza, this was his choice. Instead of a celebration it turned into a calamity. It all started at the bar. 730 on a Sunday evening the only people waiting at the bar were the 6 men in our group. The bartender Dean, ignored the group staying at the far end of the bar, with his back turned, pretending he did not see us. However upon entering we made eye contact with Dean, however Dean disregarded the group, turned his back, walking away from our group. We are not a group of undesirable customers; we own small business, one is a fireman, civil engineer, and one is a banker.  Not wanting to be bothered with his customers, Dean rushed pass the group, and disappeared in the back area of the restaurant.  After 5 minutes, yea we timed him, he rushed back in behind the bar, ran to the far end of the bar, and spit tobacco juice into a cup. At that point with noticeable regret, surly body language, and lack of concern, he made his way down to our group. I asked him his name, he asked ""why you want my name"", I said because we want to make sure we know who to pay. Dean then informed us he would be right back, and again disappeared into the kitchen. This time he reappeared only a few seconds later, and reluctantly, and unpleasantly took our drink orders, which were just some craft beers. At that point a manger appeared, I asked her what Dean's problem was and she said I will have a talk with him later. She was aware and acknowledged Dean's attitude. She should have sent him home. Maybe she didn't have a replacement, however I would suspect managers could pour beer and make a few cocktails.  Dean should not be serving customers. If he wants to be this hipster bartender servicing craft cocktails, with an attitude, he needs to find another place to work. The attitude does not work in a family casual restaurant. He needs to be terminated.  So we make it to our table and our adventure continues. Megan our server was nice enough, and pleasant, however she struggled with the orders. Half the tables food came out before any one received their appetizers, (we canceled the appetizers) carried by servers, just looking to dump the orders on the table, asking who ordered this and who ordered that, no clue, no direction, clumsily looking at greased stained order tickets, not even knowing what they were carrying. No management, no direction, no training.  So half the group sat around for 15 minutes +/- waiting for their others (including the person celebrating his birthday), while the others in the group sat politely waiting to eat their food only when the other orders appeared. 15 minutes later the other food arrived, and guess what a few of the orders were incorrect. We asked Megan if they were short staffed or overwhelmed with business (there might have been 50 people in the restaurant), she answered no to both questions. We asked about Dean the angry bartender, who hates his job, hates the customers, and seems bothered about serving customers. She said he's like that with everyone, that his girlfriend is a manager here. Now we know why his behavior is allowed.  What a great night at BJ's. At this point the manager, came out apologized, and handed everyone in our group ""courtesy cards"". Wouldn't it be nice, not to have to hand out ""courtesy cards"", just make the dining experience as pleasant as possible up front. Start by terminating Dean. Find a kitchen manager to manage the kitchen effectively, find employees who care about their tips and serving customers correctly. Just remember we live in Waco, and look what happened at Twin Peaks, and the investment dollars lost, and the reputation of a restaurant chain forever stained.     We have eating a tBJ's around the county for a number of years.  We live in Waco, and have pride in our community. I have clients who come to town and spend up to a week in Waco. They ask for restaurant recommendations the company always recommends BJ's. We have considered BJ's for our office catering. Unfortunately due to Dean, and the unpleasant experience on a slow Sunday night, we have to reconsider our opinion of BJ's.  My hope is someone at BJ's with direction, authority, and appreciation for the customer reads this and take action. Again Dean is a liability, he will not make the site money, and Dean will cause customers to stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.7880000000000003,3.1200000000000006
55,Emily L.,"Missouri City, TX",17,65,75.0,1.0,2015-08-18,"Currently, sitting in the restaurant writing this one star review and not having to worry about the waiter seeing because HE IS MISSING. When I first read the reviews on this place, I knew I might (will) encounter terrible service. But I did not believe it would be this bad. I knew it would be bad when people were MISSING from the hostess stand. We waited there for a bit, and then were seated. Where quickly again, our waiter seemed to be MISSING. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were all ready to order. And still NO ONE came. When the waiter finally came after who knows when, we quickly told him our whole order and drinks included (because it wasn't taken earlier yet). Our appetizer of fried calamari came, but we didn't have plates to eat it on. Are we suppose to eat it on the table? I think not.  Throughout our meal, waters were not refilled and we watched as our waiter slowly take his time with only 2 other tables. At the end, we ended up waiting for our bill much longer than it took us to eat both our appetizer and 4 entrees. He gave us our bill and we quickly put our credit card in.

We typically enjoy BJs and come here often, I'm not sorry to say that we won't be dining here again. My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and burger and we had brussel sprouts for an appetizer. The sprouts were burnt to a char, basically inedible. We told our waiter about it and he very casually just shrugged it off without asking if we wanted something else or wanted to get us more sprouts. Then the burger. On the first bite she took out of her burger, she immediately gagged and spit it out. There was a piece of wax paper the size of a post-it note. She even had managed to swallow some of it. She took her plate to the manager, Jeremy, who did not express sincerity whatsoever. Just gave excuses as to what may have happened in the kitchen. You would think that after such an incident a manager would show compassion and at least make the guest feel comfortable. The rest of the dinner was wasteful, all of our appetites were ruined. The manager never made a round back to the table to check or reassure if we were okay. Plus, they had forgotten to send out the birthday pazookie that was well deserved. Not to mention the service was slow. Edit: she talked to the manager, his excuse was that service was slow. I doubt that since the entire time he sat himself at the bar with another person repeatedly throughout our dinner, you can see him (purple shirt) in the attached picture. Also notice the obvious ""crowd"" showing BJ's too busy on a Sunday night.  Please avoid this establishment.

13,Maddie D.,"Centennial, CO",6,9,8.0,1.0,2017-03-17,"Didn't even get to eat at the restaurant. We made a reservation for 7 at 7:00 pm and were notified that we would have to wait a few minutes, which was fine. However, at 7:30 there was still no table. We were told several times the wait was ""just a few more minutes,"" but after over an hour and a half, we took our business elsewhere. Would have been fine with a long wait, however, we had made a reservation well in advance. So disappointed in this terrible customer service, not sure our party will be returning to BJ's unless they get their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco,3.32,3.22,3.22,,3.2600000000000007
17,Camryn A.,"Hewitt, TX",15,54,7.0,3.0,2017-05-19,"Over priced chain food, but still good. Their redemption is in the bar. Whoever does their bar selection, does it well. Craft liquors of every kind and always a new beer to try. Worth visiting during their great happy hours. 1/2 bottles of wine and you call it's. I would pass for a full dinner, but happy hour and appetizers can not be beat. Great for watching the big games too. 3 stars for price only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco,3.36,3.2,3.2,,3.2640000000000007

14,Darren C.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,5.0,2017-06-17,"We came with a large group for a family reunion.  Our first restaurant fell through.  At 6 o'clock on a Saturday evening, they accommodated our group of 40 people without blinking.  They seated us immediately, and provided excellent service for a large group.  The food here was excellent. The staff was great. They have a great variety of good food. If I had any complaint, is that the menu has too many options, and it was really hard to decide what to order.

We were scheduled to eat at Chedders couldn't get a straight answer about reservations for a group of forty they told us to show up early so we did and the they told us another 1.5 to 2 hour wait. I called BJ the manager on duty June 17 around 8 pm said he will get us taken care of if we could be there in 10-15 minutes i said yes. When we got there they had set up a table for 40 people we had 3-4 servers to wait on us.

6,Nick C.,"Honolulu, HI",61,3,1.0,3.0,2017-10-17,Good food prices fair all considered. Server jayna was inattentive and did not offer refills and didn't bring after asking as well. She did have her hands full with a lot of large tables and kept the smaller ones like I was at on the backburners.

0,Mary S.,"San Antonio, TX",116,64,86.0,4.0,2017-10-18,BJ's in Waco is a pretty safe visit. The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly. We waited maybe 10 minutes for a table of 2 on a Sunday evening. Our waiter talked entirely way too fast but reassured us that he wasn't rushing us.  The food is consistently good. We ordered pizza - barbecue chicken (deep dish) and the chicken bacon ranch (thin crust). The pizza was cooked well-maybe not fully as the thin crust was a bit chewy. The ingredients tasted fresh.  They have an extensive beer menu. I ordered the pumpkin shandy! I enjoy more fruity beers so it was amazing for me. Cold beer always makes for a good time. Especially with pizza!  I have heard amazing things about the pizookie but I wasn't able to try it this trip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco,3.6,3.23,3.23,,3.378

2,Chloe H.,"Dallas, TX",11,73,2.0,1.0,2017-11-29,"I usually get the same order when it's To-Go. This recent last time I guess they maybe do not want me placing online orders anymore. My burger buns were rock hard like a brick. The burger was super dry with no spread, as I asked for extra which I didn't get. My salad had chicken on it sparingly and it was frozen! With the wrong dressing that I never get because allergic. The salad was almost $14. I didn't wish to phone in but I couldn't understand why someone thought this was serviceable in any way plus for nearly $26. The guy who was apparently overseeing things that night appeared to not be that concerned. I didn't think it was that hard to fix. I was placed on hold forever. Then he just goes ""well, do you want us to remake it???"" It was said like I shouldn't have called about it. I said I'm far away and I'm hungry right now. He never offered any other remedy for this jacked up order. He never seemed to put forth any concern one bit that I paid nearly $30 and couldn't eat any of it and I couldn't just drive 35 mins back over there. He placed me on hold once again so I just hung up. Made me a meal out of my frig for dinner with scraps (since it was the day before I went grocery shopping) and had to consider it a loss.  I will not be back to this BJ's location anytime soon, especially for To-Go so they can throw you the weak food and run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco,3.56,3.23,3.23,,3.362

Waiter was so slow.  Orders were right but I am not sure if he had too many tables (only saw him waiting on 2 tables).  He said one order would come out in a minute and 30 minutes later kid didn't have pizza.  Took over 30 minutes to get ticket.  Over 2 hours there and one order was a salad and two adults shared a meal.  He didn't even apologize for the slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco,3.4,3.23,3.23,,3.298
1,Logan K.,"San Francisco, CA",14,34,2.0,1.0,2017-12-16,"Sat at the bar and order a bacon cheeseburger. The dollar more to add bacon meant I got two wilted, fragile, microwave bacon strips. Burger came with no sauce - no mayo, ketchup, mustard nothing. But it was piled high with iceberg lettuce to give the appearance of heftiness. The fries were cold. I had to track salt down from another table. Asked for ketchup - waited a while and got an empty bottle from the bartender who called me 'bro'.  Asked for a glass of water. Never got it. Asked for a napkin and utensils. Bartender asked if I was done with my plate and replied, 'sweet'. Upside: have 9-10 drinks here. You'll still be able to drive home.
