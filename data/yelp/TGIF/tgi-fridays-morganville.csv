Matt S.,"Windham, NH",0,3,,3.0,7/18/2017,Had to come here for business lunch.  It was another  mediocre chain restaurant.  How do they all stay in business?  Onion soup was surprisingly good.   Jack D wings were wet and unappealing.  JD boneless ones were crispy and others thought they were good.  Service was solid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville
David I.,"Englishtown, NJ",21,19,2,1.0,11/15/2017,12/31/17 7:30 UPDATE After several terrible trips here I am forced yo lower the rating to a 1! I'd give 0 if I could! The last ten times we gave come the good gas either been stale(see pictures below) or the service is non existent. We have kept coming back though because we have reward points. TODAY is new years eve and my dad and I just had the worst experience ever. The entire restaurant was complaining! There was only one Cook today and all the tables were waiting an hour of more for food and drinks even chips took 45 minutes. On top if that our server brought NO napkins  Finally I showed him a spot on my arm where jack Daniels sauce had fallen onto it and he said he would be right back with napkins and he still took 15 more minutes while I sat there with sauce all over me. To make matters worse when the food finally came out it was STALE. We got the full rack of ribs which we get every week. Today they were so tough I almost broke s tooth. Since the kitchen was backed up no waiters or waitresses were on the floor and we sat there for 45 minutes waiting to talk to someone about getting a replacement for the good we couldn't eat! Finally I got out of my booth and asked the assistant manager Frank why the manager Vinny still hasn't come over to our table 45 mins later. Frank was extremely rude to me. He didn't once apologize. He told me he didn't care if we walked out and he said Vinny is busy I n the kitchen just leave. He said in a mocking tone ''Have a nice day'' Keep in mind my dad and I are regulars here. We come here at least 3 times per week. Frank was so nasty it was terrible! So we did what he told us. We walked out! It was such a waste if two hours. Especially because we only took a few bites of our food. I did get a peak in the kitchen. It was chaos! Vinny had to work it because the only Cook there kept screwing up. You know a place has problems when the manager is doing kitchen duty. I'm attaching pics of rotten tomatoes from two different visits as well. My friends/family and I frequent this Friday's quite often Service is hood depending on who you get(our favorite is Tyler). Food can be inconsistent however it's usually very good which keeps us coming back. Only gripe is they reduced the choices on the endless apps and raised it fr 10 dollars to 13.  I also really like the rewards program. Overall a solid place..4/5 rating,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville
Ashley V.,"Parlin, NJ",29,43,17,1.0,1/1/2018,"I wish I could give 0 stars! The place smelled like sewage, right next to the kitchen. The host told us he didn't know where the smell was coming from-are you serious? We should have left right then and there. That's our mistake. We were the first people there and waited almost 2 hours for our food and kept being told it was coming out any second. The last meal to come out, when we were almost done was a salad someone ordered-a salad!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville
Alexis M.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,Food tasted weird. The only thing I wanted to take home they refused to give me a to go container because it was endless apps. Called to speak to the manager at the table and he was a complete ass.  I wonder what they really do with the food after. It's such a waste of food if that's the case. I don't care to go and buy other food but the fact that they throw it away rather than giving it to the customers to take home is ridiculous like so many people out there are starving for them to be just throwing shit out.  Not even from NJ so we didn't know and every other Fridays we've been to never denied giving us a to go container Stupid asf if you ask me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville
John C.,"Morganville, NJ",0,13,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Terrible service. The place had a few customers and was almost empty. I stood by the entrance for 15 minutes waiting to be seated.

Jorge R.,"Oradell, NJ",0,10,,2.0,12/15/2017,I don't know what has happened to TGIF in Hackensack. Service was mediocre and food was less than adequate.

Melissa H.,"Keene, TX",0,28,50,3.0,5/3/2016,"Standard TGI Friday's restaurant. No wait time, which was good. Food came out as ordered and tasted fine. Waiter was polite. Two major turn offs however... on the receipt they give a minimum suggested gratuity of 18% of the bill, and suggest two higher percentages as well. The standard for American tipping is 15% for a job well done. I'm not responsible for paying your employees wages, TGI. I tip as I see fit, and trying to guilt clientele into over-tipping is just bad manners to say the least. Second dislike are the computer screens placed on the already small 2 seater booths. Everything on these screens is geared toward children so that their parents don't have to 'parent' them, which is distasteful to begin with, but worse, every time you touch the screen it's chargable. Literally every application on these sort of monitors costs money to use. Having seen this kind of nonsense before, I promptly asked the waiter to remove the screen from our table, as it took up a lot of space, and we had no intention of using such a ridiculous machine. The waiter, although polite, was obviously not accustomed to being asked to have the screen taken away, and you could tell he was probably instructed by his superiors to encourage use of the screens. Not his fault, however, but that of the establishment.  I would rate higher if the screens were not placed on every table in a mandatory fashion, and also if the receipts removed that preposterous ""suggested gratuity"" text. I'm sure people know how to do math on their own, so please don't insult my intellect by insinuating that is it's intended purpose.  I think my review is more geared toward the chain itself, rather than this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville

However we decided to give it another chance and I'm glad we did! We came for dinner on Sunday. We didn't have to wait at all which was surprising during football season.

Helen Anne J.,"Manalapan, NJ",0,30,,5.0,9/2/2017,TGI Fridays has under gone a lot of staffing changes. The new staff is very upbeat and positive. They are telling everyone that it is Happy Hour and talking about the 1/2 price apps and drink specials.The appetizers all came out hot and were prepared and plated nicely.

Our server Billy was timely, polite and even quite humorous and cracked a few tasteful jokes. He mentioned all the drink specials, their member program, and checked on us throughout the dining experience.

The whole place smelled like stale fry oil,greasy and sticky floors and tables tops, menus even grimier than floors. Wait person up and enthusiast.....obviously on Red Bull or perhaps something stronger .Onion rings were sparse and greasier than the underside of a 76 El Camino. Fish and chips was decidedly 3'rd world with it's muddy tasting Talapia fillets and the chips were soggy sitting in the fishy oil. Salads were decent but not enough to redeem this meal.................

When the waiter noticed that we were not eating it, he prompted us what the problem was and was very attentive to us. He immediately took the appetizers off the table and the bill and brought us a replacement appetizer. The manager also paid us a visit to ensure that we were happy.  Outstanding customer service.

Travis T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",188,197,26,1.0,5/25/2013,"I've only felt more justified giving a one star review one time before this. Here's a little story about THIS Friday's, which is listed as ""Morganville"" but it's in Marlboro.  1. I moved from NJ to San Diego 4 years ago, since then I've became a Padre's fan because rooting for the Yankees isn't fun. Called and asked if they would have the Padres vs. Diamondback game available to watch that night. After 5 minute hold period, they told me they would have it. Only damn reason I went there, and they couldn't get the game on. 2. My fiancé and her sister went with me and were complaining of a vomit smell at the bar. I have a head cold so I couldn't smell anything, and thought nothing of it, until the girls next to us looked over and starting confirming the smell with each other as well. If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.... 3. Drank Yuengling lager on tap the whole time I was there. They had a 3 dollar domestic 20 oz. beer special. Here's the cherry on top, Yuengling counts as a craft beer at Friday's. OH COOL BRO, THANKS FOR TELLING ME WHEN MY RECEIPT CAME. Paid 6 dollars per beer, doesn't wreck the wallet or anything, but it sure is double 3 dollars. Mark my words I'll never be back to another Friday's... ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-morganville?start=20

Joe B.,"Freehold, NJ",361,564,28,1.0,10/13/2013,"Ok, they aren't closed so let's get that out of the way. Oh how I wish they were!  First of all. I usually don't like to give my money to businesses that have been convicted of ripping off the customers! By this I mean that not long ago, the ownership of Fridays restaurants all over this area were caught by the liquor authority swapping low end booze for top shelf! So when you thought you were getting Grey Goose, you were really drinking Gordon's! But that aside, my wife had a gift card for this place so off we went. Our waiter was a nice kid, but completely lost in space!. He takes our orders, but we have to tell him that we have a choice of sides. Never asked us. Our appetizer took a half hour to be brought out ! Not a big deal except that it was potato chips with melted cheese sauce on them! I could make that in 28 seconds! Not only that, the chips were so soggy, I thought they were stored under water!  Of course, not a minute after the appetizer makes its appearance, they bring out the entrees! My ribs were incinerated!  No taste! Just so you know, I like burnt ribs, but this was,ridiculous! My sweet potato fries were wilted. My wife's chicken tasted like it was in a fire!  Let me not forget my beer. I asked for a Sam Adams Octoberfest. This is a mainstay at this,time of year in almost any establishment. Apparently not in Fridays. They were out do,it at 4:30 in the afternoon ! So I went with a Shocktop. Guess what......no glass!   I am the last person that would ever be called a food snob, so for me to rip a place is newsworthy. Food sucked and service was pathetic.

Scott N.,"Toms River, NJ",37,37,7,2.0,4/16/2015,"Haven't been to TGIF for years. Yesterday reminded me why when I ordered the Fish and Chips and with three customers in the place, the cook couldn't pay attention enough to not just overcook the fish in the fryer but burn it black. And then not care enough to actually look at this carbon rock and rather thought it was a good idea to give it to a Yelper. Waiter apologized but he looked at it and served it to me. Nothing like crunchy rocks.  Even the frys had no taste and you think chips, you don't expect frys.  Also had the potato skins. Came with runny sour cream. Normally you'll get something a little thicker. Waiter needs to find a better place to work. They don't deserve the guy.  I did send the meal back, which, rather than just take my plate, they made me shovel the fish on to another plate. About 15 minutes later, the reorder came out but the person I was with had finished his meal already and had to wait for me. Just not a good experience.

However, our last visit to this TGIF was horrible enough to never come back. We sat at a table for 15 minutes before our server came to greet us (after ten minutes, we asked our hostess who our server was). Furthermore, after we ordered and received our appetizers, we weren't given silverware or plates for ten minutes (by this time, our food was cold). Our server was completely inattentive so when our entrees finally came, half of it was overcooked and the rest oversalted. By this time, we were too exasperated to send them back and wanted to finish the meal as quickly as possible.

Drinks took forever to be refilled. We were barely checked up on... Took forever for our waitress to even come give us the check and then she kept asking if we were ready to pay as she saw us trying to split the bill. It just overall was bad service. To top it all off, my friend and I got charged twice and different amounts. I was suppose to be charged $40, which I was but then a random $32 charge appeared on my card- 3 days later. And somehow, the same thing happened to my other friend.. Which btw... she is still waiting for a refund over a week later..

Maria S.,"Englishtown, NJ",0,21,2,3.0,1/3/2013,"I've never had a problem with this Friday's. It's a chain of course, so the food was as unremarkable as any other Friday's or Applebee's. I do prefer Friday's over the local Applebee's though, simply because my food always comes out piping hot. I think this is because this Friday's isn't as busy as the local Applebee's, so the service is faster and better. I've never had a bad experience with the service here; they seat you quickly and are attentive to your needs. Plenty of parking here too. The restaurant is clean and good for families. I particularly enjoy TGI Friday's drinks. They're large, delicious, and have a large amount of alcohol, which works for me! They're also very sweet. Sure, maybe they're girly and not sophisticated, but I have to admit, I'd take an enormous, yummy Lava Flow any day over a tiny cocktail at a snobby lounge in the city. As for the food, well... I'm not a fan of most huge chain restaurants' food, and TGI Friday's is no different. I'd steer away from steak or chicken here... Shrimp is okay, but not fresh. I'd stick with something simple that's hard to mess up, like a sandwich, burger, or even chicken fingers. The Jack Daniel's and New York Cheddar & Bacon are alright. California Club sandwich is good. Salads are large and full of unhealthy ingredients to make it taste good, which I don't like but I'm sure other people do. All the desserts are amazing and terrible for you, but I love the Brownie Obsession, Oreo Madness, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie... Mmm. Appetizers are fun, I like the Chip n Dip trio, Green Bean fries, and Classic Mediterranean Hummus. Nachos are better here than Applebee's too, mainly because they don't come out soggy with hard, cold cheese on top. All in all, I like to come here for a simple lunch or dinner and split appetizers with friends while sipping on a few drinks. Come here for happy hour!
