Upon unwrapping the flatware from the napkin, 4 out of the 12 pieces were either stained with grease, had unsightly water spots or in one case, had old lettuce stuck to it. The pizza and salad came and when you grabbed the plate, the underside of the lip was sticky on one and had some caked on food on another. There were only 4 of us so those odds are pretty high for dirty serving things. We did let the manager know and he did take 20% off the bill, but knowing we were eating off of things that were less than spotless made us uncomfortable. I would rather pay full price, and expect quality service all the way around. On the upside, our server was good and attentive.

Like most Germans, he is to the point. When it comes to dinner time he has little tolerance for Asian food. He barks: No Japanisisch! No Vietnamisch! No Koreanisch! No Chinesisch! That leaves a total of two restaurants left in Kailua and one is Peppinos (I don't even have the English skills to try to explain that place to him.) CPK it is. Parking is okay if you don't mind walking a quarter mile in a creepy parking lot. Our party of four arrives around 8 and its CROWDED. German brother in law complains about the noise level inside so request an outside table. 15 minute wait. We were seated outside by a nice local young man. He was explaining the new Peking Duck Pizza they are offering in his normal local tone. Halfway through German brother in law roars EXCUSE ME! I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING! Local guy kept his cool and started again with my wife and I pointing at pictures of the thing. *Awkward tension* Waitress comes. She is a nice lady and has a loud voice. Whew. She helps my German brother in law through the menu patiently. By the way, he hates mushrooms too.  He orders a Sam Adams. Waitress bring him a frosty mug. He barks: NO GLASS TOO COLD! *Awkward tension*  He is a brewer by trade and likes his beer warm. Wait staff all over our great island are consistently perplexed by this. Appetizer comes. Spinach artichoke dip. Germans are happy. Wife and I share grilled salad and vege pizza. Germans get BBQ chicken salad and his wife gets Chinese Chicken salad. Dinner for 4=60 bucks.

The staff was quick, but nothing stood out to me with their service.  I have tried a few of their pizza's and they are always tasty. The pizza is also not greasy like you'd expect at any other place serving pizza.  I'm not sure on their hours but their lunch hour tends to be busy and I went in there today and I thought that around 2 they would have slowed down. But they didn't.

They skimped majorly on toppings on both pizzas and they weren't even hot when we got them. The salad was pretty good...shrimp miso something or other. It was pricey for the size and didn't come with enough dressing. I think I had high expectations since I'm a California girl and have frequented CPK's in California.

169,Asako O.,"Honolulu, HI",58,212,,5.0,2012-07-30,"This California Pizza Kitchen is one of my favorite places to stop by for lunch whenever I am visiting Kailua. It is conveniently located in the heart of Kailua town with plenty of free parking available and easy to find as it is located right next door (ewa) to Macy's.   I find that the atmosphere at this location is nice as it provides a quiet and relaxing setting which is perfect for dining.  My favorite of all CPK's salads is the one and only original bbq chicken chopped salad (without avocado). Depending on how hungry I am will determine whether I will order half or full order of this popular salad. Since I was not feeling too hungry, it was going to definitely be the half order.  Even though the half portion did not look like much on my plate, it actually filled me up. This salad was generously coated with their special dressing which you can taste with every bite.     Since I have a sweet tooth I was not about to pass up dessert. It was time once again to order the butter cake for $6.75. I highly recommend ordering this specialty dessert as you will not be disappointed. To top off this cake, for an extra $1.50 you can enjoy it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This butter cake is served warm with fresh whipped cream and best shared with two people as it is a very large serving. It is light, buttery and will literally melt in your mouth. Soooo delicious! In my book, this ""takes the cake""! CPK's food as well as the service received was excellent as our waitress came around to check up on us and also made sure our ice tea glasses were always filled.   This is one restaurant where I will definitely visit again whenever I am in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=180,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.58,3.2800000000000002

My boyfriend and I ordered our usual pizzas (Meat Cravers and Spicy Chipotle Chicken, i think that was the name) and I also had the Thai Crunch Salad. we were served by Jessica and I believe we had a manager come by our table to check up on us. Everything was delicious as usual at that time. When I went home, I felt something strange in my stomach and found myself THROWING UP THREE TIMES and going to the bathroom to relieve myself NUMEROUS TIMES as well as gaining a FEVER and CHILLS. My guess is that I got food poisoning. The symptoms are almost similar to the stomach flu, as it is flu season right now. I had to unfortunately miss TWO days of work because of this sickness! And I REALLY NEEDED the money! I could barely eat anything on Saturday and the sight of food made me sick on Sunday! I feel a little better today, but I still cannot eat as much food as I would like.  I will be writing a complaint to this CPK. They really need to watch what they are doing and be sure to get rid of expired food. Or they should send home sick employees.  My faith in this establishment has dimished.

We were ignored the whole night and the other larger parties around us that our waitress had were getting plenty of attention. 4. my drink was empty all night 5. When the check came we paid with our card and put my husbands military I.D. in with it. (We were told last time they finally had a military discount.)

The manager should be ashamed of themselves and whomever owns this particular franchise. Just because you are the only cpk on the windward side doesn't mean you can get away with shitty service. How about you try hiring people who give a shit.

Then we were ignored for nearly an hour. After spending a day on the beach, we were all pretty hungry despite it being early.  Our bread and water were devoured in seconds.  No refills were offered, no one checked up on us to see how we were doing.  FOR AN HOUR!  The Ala Moana, Kahala, and Pearlridge locations are far busier, and yet the servers are attentive and the food comes out in a timely manner. The food - when it finally arrived - was really disappointing.  The pastas were cold - the mac 'n cheese sauce was starting to develop a layer of film across the top (well it would if it were sitting for an hour).  The $4.00 add on of chicken to the pesto cream penne amounted to a meager two small slices of chicken.  The wild mushroom pizza looked as if they had taken chicken chunks from their salad bar and strewn them across the top of the pizza after they baked it.  The large, square chicken chunks just rolled off of the slices of pizza as I tried to eat. Definitely won't be back to this location to use the rest of my promotional thank you cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=160,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.308,2.64

The place was full on a Tuesday nite.  We ordered 3 half salads, a pizza, and an appetizer.  30 minutes later nothing .  Then 2 of the 3 salads came out first.  We patiently waited - then the pizza came. We asked about the third salad - to which the waitress said - there was a delay because they were making fresh balsamic dressing??? Then we asked about the appetizer -later that came out in fourth place.  We had to ask about the missing salad again and was offered that it be boxed to be taken home instead - which, at that point sounded like a good idea. We ordered one dessert item to be shared- which did not take long to be brought to our table by another server working in the same section and after digging in - our waitress walked up to our table with the salad all boxed up and ready to go - except she held ANOTHER dessert - which wasn't meant to make up for the earlier mix ups - she was just as baffled as we were- and threw in the towel at that point.  But being the only bright spot of the evening - she left it with us - On The House.  My opinion - Hey Kitchen guyz - ""You Killin' us Servers out here!!""   2 Stars because the waitress did the best she could with the bad hand she was dealt.

175,Corey A.,"Kailua, HI",22,4,,1.0,2013-12-15,"I went here tonight expecting it to be pretty decent but NOPE. Everything tonight went wrong, and my family and I will NEVER be returning back again. After this experience, this place is a turn-off. If I could rate this place a 0, I would in a heartbeat. Even though we live in Kailua (5 minute drive), a 25 minute drive to Pealridge's CPK is totally worth it.  1. Overpriced OKAY food plus JUNK service = NEVER COMING BACK (not worth your time and money). 2. The waiter we had was NEGLIGENT/SLACKING/TERRIBLE: 3. The manager was the WORST/UNPROFESSIONAL. 4. The chips that came with the spinach artichoke dip was STALE and the proportion of dip to chip was off (we ran out of stale chips when there was half the dip left). 5. After I finished eating my chicken cobb salad (lettuce, boiled eggs, blue cheese, tomatoes, bacon, grilled chicken breast, and avocado) there was a random piece of grilled corn that was underneath my salad. Reasons for #2: 2A. He treated everyone else so well and making small conversations to them EXCEPT us. He rarely comes back to check on us, and isn't even a bit friendly like how he is to everyone around us.  2B. My mom ordered a salad and said no tomatoes in it, and when he brought it out she noticed it also had sun dried tomatoes, so she asked him nicely if she could get a new one without any tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes. He didn't even apologize for the mishap. He made an upset facial expression, took the salad, and walked away. 2C. After my mom asked for a new salad he became even more negligent and unfriendly to us, and he was talking to us so monotone and not making eye contact, plus I could tell that he didn't want to service us even more. 2D. He was no where to be found and never check back with us to talk about the update of the new salad the chefs were making. So we waited for another 10 minutes without anyone stopping by to check up on us and when he finally came by, he was clearing off another table so my mom was so impatient/upset about the negligent service, she said to cancel the order already and we wanted the check. He said okay and walked away. 2E. He came back 5 minutes later and said ""oh the manager is going to come and give you the salad in a to go box."" What wasn't clear about canceling the order, and to give us the check? We didn't even ask for the manager at all, we just wanted to pay and leave. But NOPE. Reasons for #3: 3A. I'm guessing the waiter made a big deal about my mom's mistake of having the sundried tomatoes in the salad so that's probably why the manager came by to talk to us I guess. We didn't ask for the manager or anything, my mom again, just asked nicely for a new salad without tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes in it. But the manager approached us the WRONG way.  3B. He came by and asked my mom ""What's wrong?"" and my mom was wondering who this guy was so she said ""what?"" like any person would. and he then said "" There was sun dried tomatoes in your salad?"" and she replied ""OH, Yes, I told the waiter that I don't want any tomatoes in the salad since I get acid reflux from eating it"" and then the manager goes ""oh, okay"" and walks away. HOW STRANGE: FIRST, he didn't properly introduce himself or anything (so we didn't know who he was), and SECOND, he didn't apologize for the mishap (as the manager the first thing you should do besides introducing yourself is apologizing for the mistake; DUH).  3C: Since the waiter didn't want to service us anymore the manager took over. So we asked for the check and then 5 minutes later the waiter told us that the manager is coming with the salad in a to-go-box. and then the manager arrived. 3D. He placed the package on the table and crouched down to talk to my mom. He said in a FAKE calm/sad voice ""I'm so sorry for the mistake, I hope that you come back to eat here again."" and my mom said ""No, I'm never coming back here again. The service was terrible."" and he said ""I know.."" My mom then replied ""Even though we live in kailua, we'll drive to pearl ridge and eat at that restaurant instead from now on."" And he didn't answer back and paused for a bit, got up, and then grabbed us the check. My mom paid through a gift card, and then he came back to give us the receipt, and walked away. And while we walked out he said to us ""I hope you have a better evening............And happy holidays!"" LIKE REALLY, REALLY?  After all that terrible service, he said he knows about it?? and then while we were leaving he said ""hope you have a better evening and happy holidays""!?! This place is a joke.

We had the salted caramel pudding which goes down smoothly even after drinking an entire peach iced tea, ate a full sized salad,  and had 3/4 of the flatbread! The tall make server brought it to us instead of our original server. .. after he sang ""Happy birthday"", We could see why he was chosen. ..for his clear, resonating and VERY audible voice!

I ordered the watermelon strawberry salad with chicken. Don't order the chicken.  It was so salty that I couldn't swallow the chicken.   I had them remove the chicken and just ate the salad. They left the piece of chewed chicken on the plate when it was brought back to the table. They didn't even offer to put another piece of chicken so I guess their chicken is always made too salty. I had to ask that the extra price of the chicken be removed from my bill since I had it removed and the waitress didn't indicate the additional cost would be taken off.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the food and the response received.

The mojito and lime agave margarita was a perfect starter before we ordered some appetizers. Lettuce ( I prefere the romain lettuce instead if the iceberg stuff) wrapps with chicken filling and the nachos with artichoke and avocado dip were really good but the sesame ginger chicken dumplings were cold like it was premade and waiting for someone to order it but it was good. I prefer it hot though.  The soy ginger chili sauce saved this dish. Our meals followed with the California club sandwich, bbq chicken salad, shrimp fettuccine, chinese chicken salad and I had the habanero carnitas pizza.

While eating the pizza, I was thinking, this pizza is not as hot as I thought it would be. Only when we were done our friend tasted what was in a small dish at the far end of the table and started gagging and reached for the water and started guzzling it. Well whatayaknow!

Another employee showed her where the tickets for takeout orders were and I signed the credit card receipt. She tells me my order wasn't ready quite yet and it would be a few more minutes. I thought ""hey I ordered about a half hour ago! The app said my order would be ready in 20 minutes and I gave them extra time!"" but having experience working in customer service, I didn't want to fuss. I sat and waited for about 20 more minutes before standing up and having the same girl ask me if I'd been helped. I told her I was waiting for my takeout order. She called someone to help me who pulls my pizza out of a warmer. It had been ready the whole time I was waiting!!! I was so irritated. I mentioned it to the guy and he rolled his eyes as if the girl did that all the time and apologized. The girl who helped me originally didn't even check if my food was ready!!!! I didn't make a fuss because it wasn't his fault, but I was upset I'd waited for a half hour and my food had been ready the whole time.

28,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",624,1458,1938.0,4.0,2014-12-30,"I ate at this CPK located in Kailua town shortly after dining at a restaurant that was sorely lacking organization. I sat facing the kitchen and marveled at the efficiency CPK must pride itself in. Seriously, I've never gotten an order wrong and my food is always delivered in such a timely manner.  This particular Kailua location shares a parking lot with Longs and Macy's. There is ample parking in the brightly lit parking structure and there are some neat shops on the walk to the restaurant. This location is tiny compared to the Ala Moana and Kahala locations; in addition, it is super popular among the residents of Kailua, so be prepared to wait. They do have bar seating that is usually available, in addition to the normal table seating (both indoor and outdoor). The also have a take out side (and little waiting area) on the street side of the restaurant. Because it is so tiny and popular though, it tends to get loud.  You can always count on CPK for consistent food options. My favorites include the BBQ chicken salad, the waldorf chicken salad, the grilled vegetable sandwich with caesar salad  and the kung pao spaghetti. Drink wise, I like their flavored teas and lemonades (with free refills!!) and their white sangria and mojitos.  The service here is typical of other CPKs I have been to, which is a good thing--the waiters are experienced and friendly and really create an experience that you want to return to. CPK also has a little rewards program that conveniently sums up your points on their mobile app. It's not very rewarding, but it's kinda fun to receive $5 off or a free dessert every other time I go.  The only downside to this restaurant is the size. I really wish they would expand!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=80,3.28,2.98,2.98,2.9280000000000004,3.1

125,Jasmine W.,"Honolulu, HI",149,202,196.0,4.0,2015-06-24,"I came here for a late lunch last week with co-workers, as we had just finished some field work in the Kailua area. We were all pretty passive on where we wanted to go, so CPK was a good and simple choice for us.  We got to the restaurant around 12:40pm on a Wednesday and the hostess told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a party of four. We opted for the first available table, since they have both indoor and outdoor seating. When we were buzzed back about 20 minutes later, they let us choose between indoor and outdoor - we chose indoor because we had been standing in the sun for the past few hours and were all pretty hot, and the AC inside seemed like it would be nice (and it was!). I had the California Club sandwich and opted for the side of Caesar salad instead of a cup of soup (again, my decision was driven by the weather/temperature outside...the soup sounded good!), and another coworker also got this same combo. The others got fish tacos and a BBQ chicken pizza. I learned to love the CA Club sandwich during my USC days, when I would use my dining dollars (or my sister's dining dollars) to go to the CPK to-go that was in the new Campus Center. This was my first time ordering the sandwich in an actual CPK and it seemed so much bigger than the to-go version I remembered! Unlike the version I was used to (where the whole sandwich was stuffed in a plastic take-out container), the bread on this sandwich was nice and warm, and the chicken and avocado were perfectly chilled. The Caesar salad was good but nothing out of the ordinary - I liked that the croutons were extra crunchy! Because I tend to eat small lunches, I finished only the side salad and 1/2 of the sandwich, and kept the other 1/2 of my sandwich for lunch the following day. It was a great portion size, especially for one of the lighter, more reasonable items on their extensive menu! The service was very good which made it a great experience! Our waters were always full, our waitress came back a couple of times to check up on us, and she even offered to split our check four ways (yes...we didn't even have to ask!). This is a great CPK, especially for those that live on the Windward side of the island, for a good simple lunch with great service.

109,Ceara K.,"Honolulu, HI",9,30,,1.0,2015-07-21,"Here we go.... I literally can't believe what a horrible experience we had at this restaurant. 1.  We were quoted 'a few minutes', we waited more than 30.  They promised us these two tables, although we didn't have a preference of where we sat... We just wanted to eat.  But they sat someone else there because suddenly they couldn't accommodate us there because there was a stroller? Whatever, I get it... My daughter is still in a stroller too.  So we wait AGAIN.  We finally get sat. 2.  Our server, Alex, had the techniques down.  Orders came out correctly.  We had everything we needed.  Drinks were full.  Speedy.  But he wasn't very personable.  He almost looked annoyed at us the whole time, but whatever.  I just wanted to eat so I could get to the bowling alley. 3.  Welllpppp folks, here it is.  I DO NOT EAT CPK'S CHICKEN because I don't care for the cuts or temperature they use.  I always forgo it, no matter what entree/salad I've chosen for the visit.  In fact, my sister (who is a vegetarian) always gets the same as me - BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad NO CHICKEN, sub avocado. So you're thinking I got chicken in my salad right? WORSE.  We don't even know what it was.  I yanked something out of my salad that I thought was cheese... Asked my family.  Then didn't think too much about it.... Out of pure curiosity, I asked our server... He said, ""oh, I think chicken, but let me go double check"".  At this point, I'm already annoyed because I don't like their chicken & I didn't want it!  Then he comes back & says, ""We've come to the conclusion that it was chicken."" Ok... Whatever.  But after thinking about it, IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT CHICKEN.  I asked the manager to come by & he was totally unprofessional.  He had no idea what he was doing.  He apologized, didn't offer an explanation, nor a remedy for the situation. When I engaged in conversation with him to try & find out what was in my salad (& what the avocado that I fed my daughter touched), he said ""yea, it was chicken skin"" WHAT?!??!?!??!!??! What does CPK use chicken skin in any of their dishes for?!?!? yea nothing!!! HOW DISGUSTING! Appalled & nauseated, I asked him if it was cooked because it definitely didn't looked cooked.  It was falling apart - which we all know ""chicken skin"" doesn't do.... He just said yea. I was over it - wanted to leave.  They offered free desserts, but being that I was already feeling nasty & didn't want chicken skin, or what they think was chicken skin to be part of my dessert, I kindly declined.  They comped my salad - but that was it. I left with a VERY sour taste in my mouth for this CPK in particular.  This would NEVER have happened at Kahala.  I will not be returning to this CPK any time soon, or ever actually.

When we checked back in, the greeter told our party that we didn't claim our table when the pager went off (in other words, placing the blame on us).  Wait a minute.  We were sitting right outside by the water fountain and had the pager with us the entire time.  The pager did not flash or vibrate during our entire wait.  Trust me, we wanted the d*mn thing to go off!   She also claims that she came out to call out our party name (again, blaming us).  Uh excuse me?!  We were, at one time, the only party waiting for seats.  Not once did any staff member call out to any waiting parties. Some of us were thinking going to another restaurant after the greeter told us that.  But the manager took over the situation, apologized to us, and offered to give us the next available tables.  We accepted. A few minutes later, we were lead to our table where a waiter greets us and asks if we would like any drinks.  A few minutes later, a waitress comes to the table, greets us, and asks us the same question.  There must've be some miscommunication going on since two staff members asked us what we wanted to drink.  But that's okay (it was a large party anyway).  The waiter did not return to our table after the initial introduction. Even though we were still upset that we waited longer than we were suppose to, the service at the tables was great.  Our waitress was upbeat and knowledgeable.  She served us very well and continued to check on us during our meal.  She encouraged someone in our party to get the Jambalaya, but get it with spaghetti noodles instead of the usual fettuccine.  He happily agreed.  Unfortunately the cooks served it with the usual fettuccine noodles.  He just decided not to make it a big deal and just ate it anyway.   Usually when I order the pasta here, it kinda erks me that I usually get a piece of another noodle that is not suppose to be part of my dish.  This time was no different.  I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti and had a piece of penne in my meal. Though our experience at CPK ended well (except for the small screw ups), we wish it only started that way too.  Sure we may go back, but it may be a little while before we decide to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=120,3.0,2.91,2.91,2.6000000000000005,2.9460000000000006

I have a few food allergies, and he really knows the details of each dish. he always keeps an eye on the table, if your ice tea is empty he is right there, if you are looking around for something, he nips over, if it's a messy item, he brings extra napkins.  Order one dessert for three of you, he brings the extra spoons. You don't have to ask for everything, it makes the meal so relaxing. he is really personable and polite and just a great addition to any meal at the Kailua CPK.  I probably suppose I should do a separate review for their curbside pickup.  if I did, the stars would be maybe a 1. often get take away when I am in town visiting family, every six weeks, and in the 20 or so times I have gotten take out, I would say 90% of the time!

The restaurant wasn't busy, just a few tables, so I didn't know what was taking so long. Everything pretty much took a long time. My daughter got a pizza with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes & Avocados. I ordered the chicken fettuccini. My food was bland and tasteless, and my daughter decided just to eat the veggies off her pizza because the crust was making her full. While she was taking off the lettuce she found a dead fly under the lettuce. I called the waitress over, and she said ""did that just get there"", pretty much accusing us of putting the fly there. I told her to take that pizza off my bill, and once again I guess whoever the night manager was, it took forever for her to give me back the bill.

Service was ok ( I've worked the bar & restaurant business for 40 yrs, so I do know good, attentive service.). Our waiter was nice, but, he seemed distracted, we didn't get any silverware till we already received our food. My main reason for writing this is the food. It tasted good. My garlic cream fettuccine w/shrimp & mushrooms tasted good, but watery. My husband's bolognese was dry...not enought sauce. I asked for half salad but got a full one. After we left, I got tremendously ill. Stomach cramps and the feeling of throwing up. I'm also sensitive to too much salt, and I know restaurant food has more salt & fat then home cooking. I had wretched headaches all night long, and it made my temperature soar to 102*. I know you think maybe I got a cold but actually it's response to high salt...for me. I look up the nutritional value on line, my fettuccine had 1200 calories, and over 1100 grams of salt, then there's the cesaer salad. So today, the day after, I'm still having a few unhappy feelings.

Kids were given a tour of the inside of CPK's kitchen led by their very own Mr. Magic. Each kid also got to make their very own personal pizza - decorate it with the sauce, cheese and topping choices of olives, pepperoni, and pineapples. As kids were guided to the back kitchen, they were amazed and wowed by watching their lil pizzas get to go in the oven!  Staff were extremely pleasant, and courteous! Nothing but smiles on their faces as they watched my kids go bonkers. Mr. Magic was wowing kids with some magic tricks up his sleeves! My one Keiki ended up melting down as she did not get the opportunity to do one particular trick the other kids did. We were able to get a one on one demo of his trick once he saw the tears. And to make her smile and giggles come back he gave her a special biting a coin in half trick! Not gonna lie even I was impressed watching him go at it! All tears quickly vaporized and my little ones eyes became very big as she was amazed at watching him eat a coin, then witness it being put back together! My girls LOVED their pizzas, and I have to admit - they looked extremely tasty! I was allowed a sample bite of their crust in exchange for a taste of my lettuce!

We then saw our food sit under the heat lamps and on the counter to be served for a long period of time before they actually were brought to our table. When our food finally arrived, none of the dressing came with the salad, I had to ask for it, and the food that was supposed to be hot was cold. My boyfriends sandwich was hard and he didn't finish it, which is a first. I would understand if it was busy, but it was midday, only a few tables, and lots of staff just talking. I've always had great experience at CPKs, but this was by far the worst.

42,Corey A.,"Kailua, HI",191,38,95.0,1.0,2016-07-18,"My family regularly dines at our neighborhood CPK Kailua Hawaii and we return because we are almost always satisfied with the food and the service. However, today we picked up our takeout order and we were COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED. We travel a lot and something that gives us comfort is knowing that the CPK on the mainland will be consistent with the taste and service of our hometown and go-to restaurant here in Kailua. Sometimes with orders there are slight mistakes but today almost everything in our order DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS. First of all, it took over an hour for the order to be completed, which is unacceptable.  Secondly, when my husband Corey picked up our order, the person handed him our drinks in a huge bag without a drink carrier. The lemonade and apple juice fell over, spilled and the bottom of the paper bag got wet and he had to take it upon himself to ask for a drink carrier. Unfortunately 1/3 of our kid's lemonade was already gone and there was no offer to fill it up. The bag was wet, falling apart, and the items almost fell out of the bag by the time he got home.  When we opened up the FUSILLI ALFREDO, it looked different from what my daughter was used to. This is basically all she eats from CPK so she definitely knows what its supposed to look and taste like. Sure enough, it was WATERY AND WITHOUT TASTE. We tried adding some salt to it, but nonetheless, after one bite, we couldn't stomach any more. It was a waste. Both the BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA AND THE WORKS PIZZA was disappointing as well. The crust on both were SOGGY and the ingredients were not at the high standard we are used to from CPK Kailua. It almost tasted OLD, like eating re-heated leftovers. Lastly, the 4 ice cream sundaes barely had any ice cream in the cups. Most of the cup was filled with whipped cream and we were surprised and disappointed yet again.   We tossed everything but the spaghetti with meat sauce and wedge salad.  We have never had an order like this so we decided as a family to let you know as a courtesy in order to help your future guests. Because of this experience, we are considering opting for other restaurants in the area instead of our go-to CPK.

My meal came out 25 minutes before the other 2 so that already was uncomfortable. In the 50 minutes we waited just for the pizza we never even had a refill on our drinks because the waitress only came back one & said she would talk to the manager to see what she could do about that wait. The manager did come over about 15 minutes later to tell us she would take care of us.

I arrived promptly at 7:00 called CPK and was transferred to the correct desk. I waited on hold for 14 minutes before I packed up my child with his wheelchair and headed into CPK. There I waited another 4 minutes before I stopped a waitress to ask if I could get my order. Only knew how long because I was still on hold waiting for them to answer. My next encounter was with the manager. I expressed my concern about how long I was on hold and waiting. She said that was not possible and quizzed me about how I contacted the location. Still on hold and the light flashing on her phone. Then as she noticed I was displeased with her attitude she offered to deliver it to my car, I was already there so said I'd wait.  They gathered my food and I laid the money on the counter. At this point she comped my food. Kind of apologized. By no means did I want my food for free. The apology was weak but appreciated. If they are unable to handle the curbside service they should just offer to go inside.  This is the third time I have spent between 30 and 40 minutes trying to get my curbside order.

The second time we came here, our friend Deb had just flown in from San Jose.  Again, we laughed and decided to come here.  The wait was only about 10 minutes and we sat inside this time.  We ordered the same pizza, the spinach dip, and some dumplings.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  Our server, ""Jessica"" (not her real name...can't remember), was friendly and took great care of us!  I believe the manager, ""Sharon"" (not her real name...can't remember), even stopped by to see how everything was.   Maybe it was the fact that I kept taking pictures of our food that we had great service.  Maybe they thought we were from corporate checking up on them...after all, we are from California...LOL!  I think most of the impatient reviewers on here have a high expectation for a chain restaurant that's in Hawaii...one of the chillest places to visit.  Or if they came in ""Hangry""...20 minutes will seem like forever.   My two visits were great!  Good food and service...and plenty aloha!  I would definitely come back, and hopefully none of those ""hangry"" Yelpers are around!  LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20,2.56,2.98,2.98,2.288,2.8120000000000003

Everything we were served was served first to the table next to us by accident: the drinks, the kids food and our meals. It got to the point where I'd just wave to the runner to let him know the food was for us. The food was not fresh. It had sat awhile. My pesto pasta was hard and sticky, no sauce at all. My husbands was dry too. The kids didn't even eat theirs. The only thing we enjoyed was the bread which we asked the runner for and finally received.

Had I known there were so many bad reviews of this branch I would have never came here. Pay close attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews before you come here.  Ordered food at 8:00 with a requested pickup time at 9:00. I arrived at 9:05 and was told by the hostess that my order was not ready yet. I looked around and there were only 3 tables being waited on so I said whatever and just took a seat. 15 minutes later and the hostess is stuffing my order in big brown bag and practically shoving it in my face without saying a word to me. I thought, gee thanks! No sorry or anything for making me wait. Took food and left. My friend ordered the Roasted Veggie salad and when we got home we discovered that her salad consisted only of lettuce, cheese and avocado. Unacceptable. She called CPK Kailua and they confirmed they had given her the wrong salad and to come back. When I got back to CPK I saw the same hostess (tall African American woman behind the cash register) and I simply said that she gave me the wrong salad. She became extremely defensive with me saying ""No I didn't, No I didn't. You're just missing the toppings."" She preceded to the back and retrieved a tiny container with the missing veggies and practically flung it at me. Again, no apologies or compensation of any kind for making me drive all the way back to CPK to receive the rest of my order. I'll admit that at this point I was a little upset, but instead of making a scene I simply took my food and left. As I was walking to my car, a hostess followed me out of the restaurant and in a real condescending tone she said ""Byeeeeee Tim Evans!"" I was absolutely shocked.

We had to ask for plates. They brought 4 plates, though there were 6 of us. We had to ask them to bring 2 more plates. We asked for balsamic vinegar... that didn't come till the bread was almost gone. Food was great, but I don't know what the deal with the servers were.

There's a reason why I prefer the California Pizza Kitchen at Ala Moana Shopping Center and the Kahala Mall.  At those locations, they bring the food much quicker than the Kailua location.  We went there today long before the lunch crowd.  There were only two tables inside that had patrons and two tables outside with patrons.  Even with only four tables, they took over 25 minutes for our appetizer! It wasn't like we ordered several appetizers either.  My husband finally had to ask the manager what was going on with the appetizer before we received it.  Honestly this place needs better management. A customer shouldn't have to wait long in an empty restaurant.  The Ala Moana and Kahala locations are far busier and they turn out the food a lot faster.  The server we had was certainly friendly and enthusiastic, but she didn't come around all that much to check on us.  We could have used more water refills and a refill of the coffee, but we were going to have to send a search party to get someone to do those things.  The food is delicious. The food is consistently good at every CPK location I've been to.

She told us it'd be 20 minutes for us to sit but the restaurant had many many open tables. After waiting for 10 minutes, we asked her for an update and also inquired as to why we were waiting when so many tables were open (was it because there were tons of reservations?), she didn't give us an explanation but snapped at us, saying ""I said it'd be 20 minutes. It's 20 minutes."" We were super taken aback by this kind of behavior. She was cold and unconcerned. When prompted again and when we asked to speak to her manager, she said that the manager was holding on seating because the kitchen was overwhelmed. She could have kindly and gently explained the situation to us but her rude and uncaring demeanor is inexcusable.  After being seated, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, a glass of Pinot Noir, roasted veggie salad with salmon and a chicken BBQ pizza. The chips that came with the dip were SO stale, the wine was corked (we had to ask for a different glass), and the salmon was insanely overlooked and hard (after specific prior request to ensure salmon wasn't overdone).

There are free refills on the flavored iced teas and strawberry lemonades so if you are really thirsty go for the flavored iced teas, or lemonade!  Since other specialty drinks are not refillable.  Although the fresh strawberry mango cooler is bubbly and really good, I would rather get refillable drinks.  Order the Buffalo cauliflower it's the tenderest most amazing vegetarian substitute to buffalo wings you can get.  The Avocado egg-rolls are really hearty too!  Also, when at CPK remember that the P stands for PIZZA. Because they have the Best pizza!!! Everything about it is so Fresh to def. The crust is soft, ever so lightly sweet and chewy. The marinara game is strong people. I'm sure that there's some legit cooking wine in there with all the mouth watering aromas. Also, their pizzas are obviously in house and made fresh to order. Even their keiki pizza are just as heavenly as the regular sized ones just miniature. My boys got the Hawaiian pizza and the Cheese pizza. My little one ate only half of his and this is a lot of pizza for a 1 year old so as most parents would do I finished his left overs (how could I let it go to waste?)

We were taken outside and greeted by our waitress about 60 seconds after we sat down. Our beverage orders were taken right away and water was brought out as we waited. Once our orders were placed our server, Melissa, offered to bring out my daughters fruit so she had something to snack on to keep her busy! Absolutely appreciated that!!!! I ordered her a Kids cheese pizza and I ordered myself the Carne Asada Pizza. For a cheese pizza that thing was pretty dang good!!! I've been to CPK before but this was my first time just taking a bite of a traditional cheese pizza. It was very flavorful and cooked perfectly!! My daughter loved it! She also enjoyed her side of grapes and pineapple! My Carne Asada Pizza actually blew my mind. The side of salsa verde that came with it impressed me way more than I thought it would. It was nice and spicy which I loved (the waitress did say it varies though so if you order expecting some ""fiyah"" [my obnoxious way of saying ""fire""] it doesn't mean you'll get it). After we enjoyed our pizza our waitress let us know that my daughters meal had a 99 cent sundae so I said to myself, ""Might as  well share a dessert with my lovely date!""

47,Matt M.,"Honolulu, HI",2,10,,3.0,2017-04-13,"Forewarned is Forearmed We've been visiting this Kailua CPK since it first opened and this is my first review of this store.  First the positives- deliciously consistent and tasty food; attentive and friendly bar, counter and waiters and waitresses. Because we really enjoy their food, and I like cold Newcastle beer in a frosted glass, we've designed a few strategies for eating at this CPK: 1) If ordering for pickup, plan to arrive later than you've been told to arrive. You should also ask if they are running a school special that evening.  Or, just arrive when they say to arrive, but plan to have a cold beer at the bar while watching some sports.  The bartenders (JJ in particular) are excellent and the beers are always served in a frozen glass.  2) Be sure to go through your entire order piece by piece to make sure you are getting what you ordered. (We actually write it down before calling it in and use that as a checklist) Sometimes they are a little skimpy on the salads and pastas when you order to go...but when it is pointed out they will make it right. Don't forget to ask for bread and their tasty, herbed olive oil. 3) When you are dining in, be prepared to take an active role in getting your food on time. If you are pressed for time, order everything quickly and ask for updates. Often they are working too many tables and they are not pros, so checking in seems to help. Or, just be prepared to take your time and enjoy yourself. Forewarned. Once we implemented these strategies, we really began to enjoy our Kailua CPK experiences. Everyone seems to be trying their best and the food is delicious.

Tip for the winemaker of the blend, I forgot which one I ordered(that's how good the meal was), dry as f. Every girl knows, I'm a guy weird but I know this stuff, blends should always be sweet.  Tip from maragaritaville.   Flour recipe must be a California recipe, the wheat has too much of the wrong stuff.  Better to use just phosphorus and potassium in equal amounts, nitrogen can be synthesized easily, plant lead structure is everything you need to know about what a plant's job is. Make food. Even poison is a flavor, everyone knows that. That's why we bred Nightshades, better known as tomatoes and eggplants as well as chili peppers to all be used for food. I'm assuming this is a worldwide thing that happened just before the Middle Ages, when people will still smart enough to build aqueducts above the ground and it underneath.  Anyway, great food, pairing was perfect, I forgot the name of the waitress, but I was the guy that sat alone, and outside.  Great pairing.

My other half and I would eat here every friday(literally) and they never disappointed. We got there a little before 7am, and asked for a booth. We always expect a 45-1 hour wait because like I said we go there a lot. After not going to this location due to us moving farther away, we were in the area and decided to eat dinner there!(yay)..not. the hostess, who was a young girl let us know that there is a booth who have their food boxed up and that it would be about 15-20 minutes. So we said GREAT!(We thought, wow, perfect timing) My other half and I get talking and notice that HOLY CRAP, it's 8 o'clock!  I send my other half to ask the hostess what's going on, and if they're not going to leave, if she can seat us else where already. He came back, and said ""we got interrupted by the general manager(peter), but she basically said they have they're check but are taking longer to leave. I wait another 5 minutes(pissed at this point, which is the only reason I sent my other half to talk to her). At this point, we are investigating the 3 booths they have and notice that the table she pointed out that was supposed to be for us, has a different family seated!!!! So not only did we wait for nothing, she lied about when I asked her. Then I told her to seat us elsewhere, and she said, it's still going go be a wait for another table. (W.T.F) her attitude sucked. So, after a terrible experience trying to get seated, we sit at the table that these 2 girls had come in after, and had already finished eating at. We decide the food is always great here and we would give them benefit of the doubt. We get greeted by a waitress and she comes out with the most stale pieces of bread, that it was crumbling at the touch. We order the avocado egg rolls and they were LITERALLY half filled, and soggy on the bottom. We then ordered a chicken picatta(noodles were overdone) and I got a thin crust roasted garlic and chicken pizza(just letting you know they charge an extra 1.50 for thin crust and DON'T tell you). So when getting my pizza, I pick up a piece and the bottom of the pizza is not crispy AT ALL, and just falls.  I decide that's it. I dealt with the bad customer service, I dealt with the bad bread and appetizer, I am NOT eating this pizza that already overpriced and it sucks. Especially when I'm paying more for thing crispy pizza and it's soggy. I ask for the manager and it ends up being a man named peter whom I watched as he approached two ladies sitting next to us, asking them their name and from my perspective, he was a little more interested in their attention, instead of anything else. So upon getting him as the manager, I was disappointed. He gave us the normal ""manager"" things to say, and took care of our bill. He was ""nice"", but I'm a manager, and I know what the bullshit things to say are, and he definitely milked it on that. I miss the old crew who were always nice. Especially Hannah. Long story short.

7,Krystal K.,"Honolulu, HI",1,10,2.0,1.0,2017-10-07,"I'm not the kind of person to write a bad review. I have worked in the food industry before so I know how hard servers and kitchens are working to deliver good food each night. I also know bad service and a bad restaurant when I see it. I want to share my experience with customers so they can have a full view of this restaurant before they decide to dine there.   - My party and I got there around 4:30 pm on a Saturday. Although the restaurant was not full with customers it took a while for our server to even greet us and even longer to get water after we were seated. - When taking our order our server abruptly joked about ordering shots (I'm fine with shots and drinking he was just a little too enthusiastic about us ordering some - shots are mentioned later which made this comment seem strange in retrospect). - We waited for a while for our food to arrive (spinach & artichoke dip + BBQ chicken salad) and a party was seated next to us. Their server joked about ordering a round of shots. It was a family with grandparents, parents, and 2 children. The grandmother said she was allergic to alcohol and she wanted a mango lemonade. The server said she was allergic too and breaks out in hives but she still chooses to drink alcohol. - Our food arrived and the chips were stale and the chicken in the salad had a strange consistency like it was under cooked.  We didn't take home any leftovers. The food was gross.  - During our meal I saw a server walk to the drink station to get a drink which the other servers were doing (the others were totally normal - getting a glass, filling the glass with ice using a scoop, and pouring water for themselves) but this server took a glass and scooped ice into the cup from the ice station directly with the glass! This is a huge no-no - you're supposed to use a scooper to avoid your hands getting all in the ice and for safety reasons (if that glass chips, the entire ice load is ruined and people could drink ice).   I was so glad when the meal was done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20,2.56,2.7,2.928,,2.644

The only reason I gave it three stars was because the food was good! The service I experienced today was absolutely horrible. I was going to give my server Jared the benefit of the doubt since it was slightly busy when we first came in but even after it started to slow down the service didn't improve. No plates were given when at the beginning of the order I mentioned we'd be sharing an app, pizza, and salad. We weren't checked on until the end of the meal. The salad was brought to us incorrectly and I had to mention that the avo was missing. Drinks weren't refilled when both of them were empty. And when we asked for our tab it took him ten minutes to hand us our bill. I work in the service industry myself so for me to even write a yelp review (which all industry ppl hate) it definitely means that this was a bad experience!

It used to be really great here and always worth the wait to be seated. Now, once you get seated, the wait to get service and then food takes FOREVER. And never an apology.  When we got our water, one of the straws was dirty and the server commented about how some kind of syrup must have gotten on it. And then left it.  The manager came to tell us that there was a problem with the pizza we ordered and it would take a while longer than the other dishes. So we ordered soup and salad instead. That still took 10 minutes longer than the rest.  We asked to taste a couple wines and the samples arrived a minute before the dinners. Our bread arrived maybe 10 minutes before that.

82,Lien V.,"Honolulu, HI",206,190,2942.0,2.0,2017-11-15,"----- Ambiance = 3 stars ----- Food = 3 stars -----Service = 1 star ----- ****  Overall  = 2.333 stars  **** (Disclaimer: I rarely take the time to write low-rating reviews but I'm making an exception especially for Kailua CPK) This CPK in Kailua is NO Ala Moana mall CPK (IMHO, it's the most efficient CPK on Oahu and I come to find out later this CPK is also a training center for all CPKs on Oahu). Whenever I'm  shopping at Ala Moana mall or in the vicinity, I've no hesitations eating at the mall's CPK.  However, when it comes to contemplating whether to eat at this Kailua CPK, I often find myself cursing myself for taking a chance at Kailua CPK. I feel like a gambler because the service here is so ""dicey"" - meaning I'm just ""rolling the dice"" here. My low rating is based on the number of visits I had at this location = 3 dine-ins and 2 take-outs. You'd think since this is a CPK Express, service would fared better and faster but that's not the case at all.    On my recent dine-in, the hostess walked me to my table (outdoor seating area) and provided   menu. After perusing throught it, I realized it has been at least 20 minutes and the waitress still has yet to acknowledge me nor come by since I got seated. Due to its small section, the only servicing (my) waitress walked passed me twice without batting an eye, a wince nor turned her head beyond her tunnel field of vision. Similar to witnessing zombie walk. It's like she's avoiding any eye contact as she kept repeatedly servicing the other 2 tables.      This was getting annoying as it was late and granted, the restaurant was not busy at 8 in the evening. So I decided to skip dealing with this person/employee. Hence, the bar seating was clear and seemed more inviting since the bartender probably would be more efficient (I'm hoping). She, (the bartender) was a little better than the waitress (I gave up on) so I was able to place my order. Bartender's service was minimally okay, nothing special, pleasant nor friendly. After 20 minutes, the kitchen informed her my lettuce wrap will be up soon. When the plate slid out, one could clearly see it was no shrimp lettuce wrap as I had ordered, it was chicken lettuce wrap. WTH - shrimp and chicken doesn't even sound alike even if you whispered it. The bartender punched in the order on their terminal system and yet, the wrong meat came out. So another 15 minutes went by before I got my correct dinner entree. What a bunch of non-reliable, low-work ethics employees we got here so far.  While enjoying my delicious lettuce wrap, 3 gentlemen arrived and sat down at the bar too. The  guy sitting closest to me apologized in advance if he's going to hit me accidentally when he swung his injured arm in my direction. It was not a problem as I didn't get hit but we ended up ""talking story"". Once the men put in their orders, the bartender started making their drinks and I noticed her hand was shaking pretty nervously and her facial expression says it all because you could easily tell the men were quite acquainted with her service or rather lack of service. There was no love lost between the bartender and these paddlers. So I asked, in exasperated tone, the one Kailua resident closest to me, ""Is the service here always bad""? He responded by throwing up his hands and replied ""Yes, service is bad here"". Ugh, I feel it too brother.  In one of my previous take-outs, this CPK was 20 minutes behind in fulfilling my take-out order. I was informed I could sit and wait while they catch up on their food orders.OMG, that is oxymoronic to the entire concept of take-out after the eatery tells you what time their take-out will be ready. Another bad dining episode I experienced at Kailua CPK plays out the same bad slow service tune where I ended up sitting at the bar. Acknowledgement and orders were basically non-existent and nonchalant. Granted, when I choose to dine at a chain-restaurant or eatery, it is for their food and customers do know and expect consistency of quality from the chain whereever the locations maybe.    What is it about the bad servicing issues here in Kailua CPK? Don't get me wrong, I've always loved eating CPK's food and always will. But the one CPK I intend on patronizing as a last resort is CPK in Kailua. Having dined at this Kailua CPK more than a few occasions, I basically have lowered my expectations and try to avoid eating here unless friends  insist on this CPK. An unfriendly staff with a lackadaisical attitude is no place for me nor anyone looking for a decent dining experience. Perhaps it's the isolation of its geography (located on the ""other side of the mountain"") which might (the only plausible reason I can deduced) explains the core reasons why this Kailua's CPK is consistently bad in the servicing department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua,2.52,2.68,2.876,,2.616

(The pizzas have definitely shrank since they first opened). There are two reasons I am not giving them one star at the moment: 1) Their avocado egg rolls are always fabulous 2) The service is good I ordered take out from the Kailua CPK today, and the person I was speaking on the phone with took quite a long time just checking if they had avocado egg rolls available. When I arrived, the waitress that took care of my order was extremely nice and apologetic for making me wait (even though I knew I would have to wait since I was relatively early for a takeout order). My problem arose when I got home and opened my order of avocado egg rolls and the new ""small plate"" of spicy buffalo cauliflower. I understand that it is a ""small plate,"" but an order of spicy buffalo cauliflower totals to more than $8. With $8, I should be able to get a sufficient amount of crispy, fried cauliflower. I also understand that since I ordered take-out, the sauce will not be covering the cauliflower as it would be if I ordered in-house. Still, I have never seen a sadder looking appetizer. The cauliflower was weepy, there was not nearly enough pieces, and it all looked as if it had been hastily tossed into the takeout container. I will most likely be back because I enjoy their avocado egg rolls, BBQ chicken salad and kids curly mac & cheese. There are many good items on their menu, but the spicy buffalo cauliflower is not one of them (especially for take-out).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua,2.08,2.6,2.832,,2.3920000000000003
