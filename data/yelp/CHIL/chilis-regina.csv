D S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",1,15,3,3.0,9/10/2016,"Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. And I always think having the managers bring out the food is a nice touch, it says ""we care"".  Food was mediocre. I hate when I order a rice bowl and they clearly use uncle bens instant rice, but again... We were hungry and the food was decent enough. Better than fast food anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
Jarvis D.,"Nipawin, Canada",8,2,3,5.0,6/25/2016,"Went out for lunch as a family before a wedding.  Lemon waters, excellent food and great service.  My daughter loves Chilis and ordered spinach queso dip and loved it.  Definitely will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
Benjamin M.,"South Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",1,28,1,1.0,8/6/2016,The bartender is not good.  He's more interested with what is on tv and the employees hanging out at the bar than he is of the paying patron.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
Jill H.,"Regina, Canada",0,23,,1.0,11/7/2015,The steak I ordered was disgusting.  The only good thing about this place was the waiter did a good job and was always around filling up water.  Which I need lots of to get through my leather shoe of a steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
Lisa P.,"Calgary, Canada",77,262,135,1.0,9/11/2012,"Total disappointment! I was in Regina for a couple of days staying nearby at the Holiday Inn. One night I walked over to Chili's for a bellini. Last time I was in town and ate here I had one that was amazing. Not tonight. They changed their recipe and now it's a bland peach not slushy drink and had no sangria in it. So I asked for a frozen raspberry margarita. Even worse! It had this big black gob in it and when I asked what the hell it was, waitress said it's vanilla bean. WTF?? Who puts vanilla in their margarita? Chili's that's who. So she made me one without vanilla. I couldn't drink it because it was so sweet, just like syrup. I told the waitress this was a complete disaster and I didn't want any of these awful drinks. Left thirsty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
Issac M.,"Regina, Canada",10,58,23,4.0,1/14/2009,"Great service and food. You may have to wait up to 40 minutes for a seat during prime time for groups, but plenty of seats for 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
JP S.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,23,,2.0,4/5/2013,Not impressed.  I figured being a chain it would be similar to the Chili's we love down South but not at all the same.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina
