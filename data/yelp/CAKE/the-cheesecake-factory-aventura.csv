Boris M.,"North Miami Beach, FL",25,33,,4.0,12/16/2017,"People, its a Cheese cake factory. No idea what some people are expecting. It is big as their Corporation. When I come here I know what to expect and what type of food I am getting. I love it. For me the most important thing is SERVICE and they have very nice people working there. William who took us to our table was amazing. What a nice and handsome guy. He spoke Spanish to my grandmother who immediately fell in love with him. Good job.  We loved our food especially the Red Velvet cheesecake O M G ...it was extremely good.   I think our waiter's name was Juan.. very nice as well.  We are locals so we always come here. I hope I get to see Williams smile again. Nice employees means good managment. Bravo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Nasha P.,"Miami Beach, FL",101,152,216,4.0,11/29/2017,"I hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years, and frankly it wasn't my first choice when my friend and I had to pick where to dine after a movie. But I was pleasantly surprised that they had many healthy options. Something I never thought went together with the name of the restaurant lol. I was happy with my vegan ""cobb"" salad and my friend was happy with her sliders, not vegan ;) I removed a star because of the service. Once they brought our food, the server never came by to see if we needed anything or if everything was ok. But if you are in Aventura mall and are leaving a late movie AND your vegan, don't be afraid to check this place out :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura

Favorite the one with avocado one. Had order spicy chicken sandwich. Not shown in picture. It really good. Make no mess. Feel light on my hands. Juicy. Hmm. My boyfriend had salmon dinner with potatoes. His real good too. Not shown in picture. Only thing is, have to wait awhile. It worth the wait. But it isn't that long though.

Huge menu including a skinnydelicious  selection which is 590 calories or less. They have salads, sandwich, full dinners and a Sunday brunch you can always find something to eat here. Let's not forget their amazing cheesecakes and other desserts. We got there just at 12 noon so the wait was only 5 minutes and we ate outside. We ordered the Chinese chicken salad lunch portion which was plenty to eat. We also had a turkey burger from the skinny menu which came with a salad. Both were very good. As soon as we sat down our server brought us fresh brown bread with butter. The service was great and the prices are very fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura

I really appreciate eating here, there huge selection offers you a diversify that you could eat here all week and not repeat my choice. It's perfect for families with big/small kids, families reunions, big groups... It's a very casual place. I only tried to avoid vacation time and tourist season, it stays hardly full.

Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",87,285,304,4.0,7/6/2017,"I had a lovely experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Aventura, FL for my last couple of visits so I figured it was only right for me to complete a review.  This is a high volume restaurant; most likely because it is located at one of the largest (and best) malls in the area. Please note, you cannot make a reservation nor can you do call ahead seating.  There are certain times where I wouldn't dare step foot in this restaurant (peak times, weekends). However, my husband and I had a late dinner yesterday ~8:15pm and it wasn't too bad.  WATCH OUT when you walk in. On top of patrons trying to enter the restaurant, you will also be amongst the servers going in and out the door! There likely won't be a place for you to have a seat (waiting area is subpar) but you can get a buzzer and do a little shopping while you wait (I'm unsure how far the pager goes).  My experience... my husband and I asked for a table of two and had to wait approximately 5 minutes. We were seated next to the kitchen door which is normally extremely frustrating to me but the back of the booth has such a tall divider that I couldn't even notice.  Our waitress was most helpful. I ordered strawberry lemonade (which is honestly way too sweet but I had a sweet craving at the time). I always request to only have the wheat bread in our basket because... well, it's just that darn tasty! We ordered the chicken nachos as a starter (Mm mmm good!) and decided to share the  orange chicken entree. Honestly, all of their entrees are oversized... we try to make good decisions!  Service was great. Food was DELISH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Veronica A.,"Bowie, MD",84,110,145,5.0,9/18/2017,The gumbo is my favorite thing on the menu. Happy hour is also great too!

Sydney J.,"Vaughan, Canada",2,38,7,4.0,1/4/2018,"Where can i start, its your typical cheesecake factory with 100 options on the menu. The food and its flavour was good and just on par with any of the other cheesecake locations i have visited. However the service was exceptional. Maybe it was because we were eating at a rather slower time that the restaurant was less busy but our waiter was great. Food came out really fast and the waiter got along great with us and made a few jokes that really did enlighten our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Yara M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,4,2,1.0,1/6/2018,"I attempted to order food over the phone because I had to take my lunch so I could not sit in, to only be put on hold for a total of 20 minutes. I hung up and called back again and patiently waited for about 10 minutes to speak to a manager or anyone. At this point I didn't care who I spoke to, I simply wanted to order food. I called about 3 times in total for absolutely no reason because I didn't even get to order because no one answered. Crappy service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Ivan H.,"Miami, FL",91,244,1989,4.0,5/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to end the night. The staff is always very friendly, and if the wait's too long, you can look for an open table in the bar area.  Food is usually on point being it's Cheesecake Factory and desserts are always a great plus. I usually order the Teriyaki Chicken, bone in and it's always good. I've also ordered a steak one time but it wasn't so great. I fault myself for that being that this isn't a steak place, and so I should save those cravings for another place I enjoy going to.  My favoite desserts are the Banana Cheesecake and the Tiramisu Dessert (not cheesecake)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1608,475,1689,3.0,11/30/2016,"We were early so there was no wait for a table. Service was fairly fast also. Although the waiter seemed a bit snotty. I ordered off the ""skinny"" menu (under 590 calories section) and got a turkey sandwich with bacon, avocado, tomato on a roll. I asked for no mayo but it came with mayo so I deconstructed it. Sorry, no photo! There was also a side ""salad"" - a small dish of greens topped with some sort of dressing.  It tasted fine. My companion liked his regular chopped salad -- said he'd order it again.

After a few hours of wandering the mall to find my mom a dress we ended up at the Cheesecake Factory and it was packed. Seriously packed. I have to give the staff kudos for efficiently handling the crowd and getting us seated in 15 minutes. Service did not suffer at all. I got stuffed mushrooms and a salad and enjoyed both.

Kitten J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,32,54,1.0,12/14/2017,"Mehhhh.....what horrible food. I ordered the herb crusted salmon, received it with absolutely no lemon butter sauce.  How the heck does that happen?  My husband ordered he grilled salmon blackened, both overcooked. If you can't properly cook salmon or steak your shouldn't be in the kitchen. How dreadful........Both spinach sides were chewy and overcooked. I had large hard, uncooked lumps of potatoes in my garlic mash.  This location may be to ""busy"" for its own good, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Wendy V.,"Opa-locka, FL",85,1,,3.0,1/7/2018,Let me start off with how much I enjoy coming to cheesecake factory for dinner and brunch. But this morning's experience made me think otherwise for this location. We waited about 20mins before we got our server to come by and take our drink orders. It's not busy at all so 20mins is a lot of time considering that she went to another table that sat down AFTER us first. I ordered their caramel macchiato. Walked away and didn't give me a straw. Of course I spilt it on myself for trying to drink it from the glass. Next the bread was definitely day old bread as it was hard as a rock. Only thing good about this meal was my omelette.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura
Amanda B.,"Coral Springs, FL",15,30,11,1.0,12/22/2017,"This review is NOT about The Cheesecake Factory - it's about Door Dash the service on The Cheesecake Factory website for online orders.  Last night we hosted a holiday party for our law firm at our managing partners home.  We decided to order 18 appetizers from TCF as everyone loves them and they are the closest to her home.  We used Door Dash the day before to input the $200 + order and selected delivery between 4:15 p.m. -4:30 p.m.  Now, we ran into traffic heading to her home to set up so we already knew a 4:30 delivery would most likely be a few minutes late (maybe even 30 min).  Acceptable.  The mall traffic was crazy, 95 was a mess.  However at 5:30 p.m. there was still no food/ no delivery.  That meant our food was ready at 4pm waiting, sitting, getting cold. We reached out to Door Dash who confirmed that the driver was running late and was not yet at TCF.  Which we knew because we called TCF directly.  We ended up having to pick up our own food and serve 18 appetizers (which arrived cold and soggy at 6:30 p.m.) 2 hours after the delivery was to arrive we had to reheat EVERYTHING.  Completely and horribly embarrassing.  My recommendation is that Cheesecake Factory disassociate themselves from this horrendous delivery service and use someone else.  DO NOT USE THE ONLINE ORDERING FEATURE.  GET IT YOURSELF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941,4.0,6/17/2016,"This is a review for the Cheesecake Factory Happy Hour offerings in the bar at their location inside Aventura Mall.  They reeled me in with a Mojito for $5.50. The best happy hour food were the fried chicken sliders. There were at least four reasonably sized sliders. They arrived very hot, freshly fried. Aventura's chicken sliders were more substantial than Dadeland Mall's chicken sliders I tried a few weeks later.  I wouldn't recommend the ""Vietnamese"" summer rolls. They must be made way in advance because the rice paper became very white and hard. Ideally the wrapper should be dipped and rolled just before serving, so that it's still soft and chewy when eaten. The pork eggrolls, artichoke dip, and ahi tuna tartare were okay. Overall, the portions of most of the Happy Hour foods at this location are bigger than Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",2319,538,2075,3.0,12/3/2016,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factory many years and this location is one of the few sit down eating options at Aventura Mall. With that being said it is always packed and therefore they should plan for the crowds but they don't.  We put our name in party of 2 10 minutes believe me there is no science to this as they just give a time of 10 minutes so you won't leave. We said we will sit inside or out but either option is crowded and loud. So after 20 minutes we get called for a table for 2 inside one side bench seat the other side chair. The entire evening my husband would move his jackets that he just purchased so the 2 year old next to us could go back and forth to her seat all night.  The service was lousy as our waitress took our drink orders but came back saying it will be awhile as the bar is backed up. We order our food and various servers came to bring our appetizer and than our entrees. These are not timed but just randomly given out. Therefore you get your appetizer and once you start eating my entree comes and than by the time I am done my husband gets his entree. Also forget about getting another drink as that ain't happening.  So the Mojito I had was great but if I want another drink I guess I have to go somewhere else. The Tex mex rolls were good mini in size and the dips of salsa and avocado were great. The lettuce wraps too generous a portion so I got a to go box that was flinged at me quickly so I will get to eat later when I can get a drink to wash it down. After we already asked for the check and got it from our server she thought it would be a great time after the fact to ask if we want dessert. Crazy I know but I needed a drink and that wasn't being offered as I guess the bar is still backed up.  My photos below are from my last visit as well as the current visit, but I didn't write a review interesting before the southwestern egg rolls were 8 large ones now they are 8 mini for the same price. Also luckily last time I was able to actually eat cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  Bottom line great food consistently but always terrible service at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
David M.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,37,2,3.0,6/21/2017,"So this is your typical Cheesecake Factory except they could care less if your meal comes out wrong, takes longer than usual, if they add items you didn't order to the bill, or not deliver your food at all.  Could just be that we had the worst waiter in America but I doubt it.  Save your money and go next door there's an awesome boutique Italian restaurant. 6/18/17. I did view the comment below from management and sent them further details at the 'contact us' area of their website on 6/21/17.  I will update review after hearing back from them.  As of today 7/2/17 no one from Cheesecake Factory replied so I guess they just post a comment about being concerned whenever they get a negative review but never actually address it.  Not going to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20

Danny T.,"Miami, FL",144,43,218,5.0,1/25/2017,"Whether you're coming in for a full hearty meal or just a slice of cheesecake, it's hard to go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  One of my favorite dishes is the sweet corn tamales. Not many people know about this dish (and it is on the happy hour menu so you can try it for the cheap), and it'll change your life! It's such a perfect mix of the sweet corn outside with the lightly spicy goodness that they fill the tamale with.  My other go to dish is the hibachi steak. Such a big portion that I normally am able to share the dish with someone else and like Magic.... one meal becomes two. Their portions are huge!

Tara S.,"Manhattan, NY",62,22,33,5.0,11/8/2017,"I was on vacation with my dad in Florida and we decided to check out this restaurant being that all the shopping in the mall had us starving lol. It was kinda crowded inside and we waited about 15mins for a table. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was just lovely, reminded me of the Roman times. Ceiling artwork is fantastic! Our waitress was really awesome at explaining the menu and answering any questions we had. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE! Two people can easily share from one entree. Our dishes were so delicious and flavorful. The bistro shrimp pasta was to die for! Never had anything like it. My father got the lasagna and said it was really tasty. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was a little bit too sweet (didn't taste like it had any alcohol). For desert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake (with Nutella on top) and it was so creamy and fresh.

The happy hour deal is great; a wide variety of drinks for less than $6. Since we had recently eaten at Steak 'n Shake (ugh!), we didn't partake of the similarly priced HH bites, but they looked great. Larry had a Long Island Iced Tea (x2) and I had a pink lemonade and a mojito. The bartender was friendly and if I were not an honest person, we would have gotten 4 drinks for the price of 1 as she didn't tote up the bill correctly.

Today, its okay, not much has changed off the menu, the service is mediocre and the food doesn't always live up to the description (hence my spicy chicken tacos were not spicy at all)  A little disappointed by the service. I got here at 1130. It was literally empty, yet my food and drinks took longer to come out than those who arrived and we seated 30 minutes after me.

We requested that the burger be remade because it wasn't cooked properly and the waiter told us that they won't remake a fresh one they'll simply scrap the cheese off and remove any toppings and try to FIX THE SAME PATTY. I found that to be quite gross and shocking. I ordered calamari and the eggroll sampler, while the the sampler was to die for the calamari tasted old and soggy I mean completely bland no salt or pepper or anything what happened chef? As my entree I ordered the fish and chips and again it was quite boring as far as taste. Finally DESSERT! OMG! Can you say perfect, I ordered the Warm Apple Crisp it was warm and cool at the same given it has vanilla ice with baked Apple slices and cinnamon streusel goodness everywhere.

I never felt so invisible in my life, I literally told my date to not park the car because we I was going to leave, I got up from the table and walked away the host seen me leave and didn't even say anything, completely disappointed not sure I'll even come back to a cheese cake factory again you can even roll back the camera footage if there is any to see how long I was sitting there unattended",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
Michael S.,"Miami, FL",435,341,1943,3.0,3/8/2016,"There is so much hype that surrounds this chain and the crowds are always vast. I wonder if it truly is the namesake, or the allure of the overdone dining hall, or just the options for days on the menu. Anyway you slice it, Cheesecake works for a lot and the food is more than adequate. This location in Aventura mall of course is always packed. I went this past weekend with my folks, so it was three of us, and the wait around 6PM was about 35 minutes. Not too bad after we surveyed the amount of people I must say. But with a huge outdoor area and vast dining room, that amount of people still needed a substantial wait. No big deal. Once we sat, we were promptly greeted by a nice server who gave us bread right away, always a plus, and brought our drinks quickly. After we ordered, the food came rather quick with all things considered. I am happy to report, and also have posted a photo for, the newly added ""Falafel Salad. I realized after I ordered that I had made it vegan, which works for me even though I am not. I just opted for no feta cheese nor dressing, and added some olive oil. This made for a wonderful salad filled with Kale, Romaine, Tomatoes, Cucumber and of course, Falafel. A great taste and would be a recommedndation from me for others. We of course concluded the meal wiht the perfect slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake and split three ways, none of us felt bad about the adition I am sure. Ha. All in all, it was a great experience, I give the place three stars as it is just another chain that you can enjoy in Miami or across the country; nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20

Robert C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,117,2,1.0,11/25/2017,"If I could give it minus a star I would. Went on Black Friday and boy black is what the experience was. It was its usual zoo like atmosphere at the entrance. I had been used to that. We got seated pretty quickly all in all.  First I order the chicken picata. It comes with a cream sauce on top. Never seen that, and for a good reason, when I taste it's awful. Picata is in a WINE sauce. So I send it back then order the chicken parmagnan pizza, whatever that is supposed to be. I said let me give it a shot. Pasta on top. I was starving. Two bites of it and I knew things were going downhill fast. So I sent that back. By then 0 for 2, I figured I'd play it safe, and order NOTHING. Finally my family, who weren't satisfied either, ordered the cheesecake, which really, was just average. Nothing compared to Junior's in Brooklyn. 3 bites turned out to be my dinner. Actually, the bread rolls were terrific and the high point of the meal.  In short, I used to like this place but it's gone down faster than hooker's head. Unlike a hooker I wasn't charged for sending back my dishes, which was the best thing I could say for a place I once held in esteem, but now am never returning too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
Courtney R.,"Derry, NH",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Myself and my family will never come here again. Quoted a 30min wait, ended up waiting double that. When finally sat, the five of us were brought to a table that normally seats four. As being sat we saw a large booth clean and available. We asked the host to sit there, she checked with the desk and came back to say ""no, sorry this table is for parties of 6""... Less than five minutes later, a different party of five was sat at this table. Thus lied to for the first time. Shortly after receiving our drinks, another large booth opened up. I went to the front to ask if we could move to this table, explaining that three family members are visiting from Europe and leaving tomorrow and we would greatly appreciate a more private experience. The manager then said ""I'm sorry this is for a party of 6 or more""... About 10 minutes later ANOTHER PARTY OF 5 sat there. Thus lied to the second time.  It is obvious this establishment only cares about getting people in and out, and could give two f**** about actually making their customers happy.

They need to take a lesson from our wonderful waitress.  Polite and courteous!!! I never want to return here again.  Needless to say I'm not willing to eat the food if our table is this filthy and being wiped down with a rag that looks like it's been used for a week.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20
Irina K.,"Hollywood, FL",3,53,24,1.0,8/4/2016,"My husband took me here today for an early birthday movie and lunch celebration. I enjoy this place and their menu options. Today was the first day I really did not enjoy our experience. I ordered a app. Size Caesar salad with grilled salmon without croutons and my husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken breast with broccoli. The waitress asked if he wanted the lunch  portion and clearly he said no the full size as he could only eat the chicken and veggies no carbs. So our food arrived with his being the lunch portion , and my salad having croutons. The waitress didn't even say anything about my croutons so I just removed them .  I was eating the salmon and did not notice at first it was medium rare. First, I never knew I had to tell my waitress what I would like. The salmon looked fully cooked on the edges until I cut it in half. I asked the waitress and she told me I need to tell my waiter or waitress how I like it cooked. I looked at her like you are our waitress. I never knew that and told her I wish she would have mentioned that to me because each restaurant has a different way of making food. She said yeah and just ignored the whole response. She is lucky I am not pregnant because if I was I would lose it. You don't as me how i would like my salmon cooked and you pick for me medium -rare. Wow , just wow. Her name was Sarai. My husband meal took forever to correct that he just had it to go . She never once talked to the manager to notify him of the issues not apologize for the mistakes.  It is sad when a good company has certain people that make it look bad. I had some really amazing waiters and waitresses here that work there butt off and if there is an issue they try to resolve it. They know how to be efficient and provide great customer service . So she does not reflect her co workers that are actually good. I just won't want her to be my server ever again. Also, if it is true what she said about the Salmon the company needs to put that on the menu. Undercooked fish is dangerous and can make someone sick. If what she says is false I hope the manager will address this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=20

Richard P.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,4,,1.0,2/17/2017,"Received the worst customer service I've received in a Cheesecake Factory on my first time trying this location.  My first server took 10 mins to greet me, never looked at our table again after taking our initial order (no water refill, nothing, all food and drink was brought by others). This was especially annoying because he asked the table next to us how they were. Then, when our main course was halfway done (brought out by a food runner) someone else asked if we were ok. I asked who she was and she said she's our server. I asked who the first server was and she said there was a mixup. Interesting. Maybe this is why we were ignored our entire meal? Took the manager aside and told her in detail my negative experience and she said sorry and that she will have to follow up with my server. She then asked if I will be paying in cash or credit. When I handed her my credit card, she charged me my full bill and didn't so much as offer me a cheesecake. I received awful customer service, was ignored, no refills, neither server introduced themselves with their name---but I was still expected to pay in full and without any sort of accommodation for the terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=40

First of all I want to say that back in Chicago we went to Cheesecake Factory often, and always loved the food.  I ordered my usual dish...Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The dish was OK - not the same amount of flavor as always, and the eggplant was missing. On the other hand, the pine nuts made up for the missing flavor in the dish.  My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs...we had asked the waitress if they had spaghetti bolonese and she said that this was the same dish...WRONG...besides being the wrong dish, the noodles were stale and the dish was dry. We returned the dish.  In place, we ordered the peanut chicken...hoping this dish would be better...Sadly, everything was drowning in red salty sauce...like a soup. The waitress brought us a side of rice to make it taste better, but the whole thing was just a disaster. On top of all of this, we had to ask for bread/water after not receiving any. Plus, the other tables our waitress served also kept looking for her to get bread/water. By the way, the customers who were sitting behind us made a joke to the waitress about us being difficult and she rolled her eyes and said ""I KNOOOW"". Not OK.  We told the waitress about all of this and she didn't really seem to care and denied talking about us to the other guests. We wrote her a LONG note on our receipt so she would never serve/treat her future guests this way at Cheesecake.

Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867,3.0,4/30/2015,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory numerous times through out the years and it hasn't really changed.  In relation to where this restaurant is located it is a part of Aventura Mall at the southern east mall entrance between Sears and Bloomingdale's.   There is an entrance also from inside the mall beside Trattoria Rosalia's not far from the Apple Store and the 8 star pointed fountain. While the service at the Cheesecake Factory always seems to be good there are some things here that could use improvement.  The outdoor seating for example, when it rains there are a lot of seats available but some seem to get slightly wet.  If they could do a better job covering those tables perhaps they would be able to be used all the time.  There are fans above the covered area so I'm guessing they don't want those to get wet considering they use electricity.  Somehow, perhaps protect those tables from getting wet so they aren't left idle and more people can use them. Another issue is the inside waiting space.  It's very small, the bar is also very small compared to other Cheesecake factories I've been to.  Lots of people are willing to wait for tables to eat at this place.  There really needs to be some more accommodation for them somehow so they aren't all cramped in that dim area. The bar being small is sort of closed off from the waiting area and other areas have glass partitions.  This particular restaurant just seems more closed off than others we've been to.  I get that you want privacy but this Cheesecake Factory just seems cramped.  I don't necessarily get the same feeling from say the one at Cocowalk. The food is the same here as it is at the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to which means it's good food, big portions and large everything except for space on the table. One piece of advice, don't eat the bread.   You're going to most likely get full off just your main dish so apps are also a trap.  Don't eat bread or apps if you want cheesecake for dessert but don't forget you can always take your food home with you too. One more thing, this place can get pretty stuffy inside at times.  It's almost like the AC can't keep up with all the people generating heat in this place.  I changed my table from first available to inside just because it was way too humid outside to enjoy dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=40

Mark S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",239,352,504,3.0,3/22/2015,"3.5:  you know how, when you order a pizza with more than 2 people, nobody can agree on the toppings? That's where a place like CF comes in: there's something for everyone, because the menu is huge (as are the portions).  It's funny that a place with a name focusing on dessert (cheesecake), serves food in such large sizes that you are nearly certain NOT to have room for dessert. Even if you share, it seems any cheesecake you order will be ""to go"".  Food snobs would not even stoop to review a chain restaurant, but I live in Aventura (basically), and I feel a civic duty to tourists to paint a full picture of my home turf. And CF is really not that bad. There is variety, value (items are not cheap, but big - lending easily to sharing or a second leftover meal), it's good for families, it's in a mall (you'll be there anyway, so if you want something a step up from food court...), and it's worth a try if you are a tourist from a place that doesn't have an outpost (I'm thinking here of my fellow Canadians).  I say 3.5 because I think it has more appeal than next door ""Grill on the Alley"" for the reasons in the previous paragraph. I also think it is a slight step up from sister restaurant ""Grand Luxe Cafe"" (same ownership, also with an outpost at Aventura Mall), which has a less interesting menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=60

My visit was on July 23d, 2017. I invited my friend that was visiting from another country to have lunch with me at this location. After being sat by the hostess we waited around 15min and nobody approached us. So I stopped the server that was talking to the table next to us and sure saw that I was looking around and just ignored the fact we are not being helped and told her that we've been waiting for a while. She didn't even smile or tried to be polite and just said it's not her section and she will tell our server. I work in restaurant bussiness and at my restaurant servers are tought what means team work! After waiting a few more minutes our waitress showed up chewing a gum and looking absolutely unprofessional! She approached me with an attitude and just asked ""Can I help you? "". Excuse me??? Am I at the doctors office??? I just kept looking at her because I was so shocked that didn't know how to react. No apologies that we were waiting, no smile, no greating, Nothing! I literally read in her eyes how she doesn't want to deal with us since we already complained about waiting and that we're probably one of those tables that don't tip. Wrong! I always tip good 20% and all you had to do is just apologize and then do your job. I immediately asked for a manager and explained the situation and asked to be served by another waiter. Manager looked too busy to really show he cared. We had lunch and the girl brought the check, and still no apologies, no manager coming back and making sure if everything was fine at the end. I still regret that I was too nice and didn't ask for a manager to come back to make a big deal out of it. I should have asked what was that server's name so I could mention it here.

When we got there, he noticed more than a handful of empty, clean tables outside so he sat down and I went inside to let them know. There was only one family in front of us, who were already being seated. Even though we already had a table, we still had to wait an extra 5 minutes before someone could walk us to the same table. I told them I was pressed for time and they said it was not a problem. When the waitress came, she took care of another table and didn't acknowledge us until we asked a bus boy to get her. About 10 minutes later, she finally took out order. It took about 15 additional minutes for us to even get bread or our drinks. After another 20 minutes of waiting (and no sign of our waitress) we asked another waiter to ask her to bring our food in to go boxes with the check. When it arrived another 5 mins later, it wasn't packed up so we had to package it ourselves and wait longer for to go bags. Overall the service was not great, the waiters and waitresses are hard to get ahold of and they weren't very polite considering it wasn't slam packed.

Surprisingly only had to wait 5-10min for a party of two around 5 on a Thursday.  They were out of the wonderful wheat bread which is surprisingly a first. Our waitress was very sweet but being here I kept getting the feeling that we're being rushed out of here So they can turn over tables. I ordered the ginger smash - a whiskey cocktail with ginger, simple syrup and Sprite, it was bright and refreshing.  The avocado egg rolls are the best, so simple but bright and the sweet sauce of mango and cilantro accompanying it makes the avocado, red onion wrapped in wonton. In addition split the pasta carbonara with the sigfig, it came out promptly after the egg rolls. It had more lemon than I'd prefer but it was still good. We got a healthy dose of parmesan atop the pasta and feasted.   This is certainly the place you go when you want consistently good food and can't decide what to get. The menu is huge along with the portions. Highly recommend splitting an entree so you can save room for the amazing cheesecakes for dessert. My favorites are the lemon raspberry, then the coconut, and Carrot cake cheesecake.

Moran H.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/18/2016,"I have visited many other Cheesecake Factory branches and never had a terrible experience as I've had at this branch.  I went with my 18 month old daughter and they got me a very small and crowded table, I was very uncomfortable at this table sitting with a toddler and a high chair, so I requested to move to a different table. I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the other table, and when I finally sat down, the table and the floor was so dirty with leftover tuna and vegetables, that was totally disgusting. I had to wait another 10 minutes to address the issue until I saw a waitress, the waitress just told me ""I'll be right with you"" and disappeared for another 10 minutes.. okay, she came back and said I'll be right with you again and left!! 5 minutes later she came back and said they will clean shortly.  I ordered the sliders with NOTHING on it but grilled onion, I also mentioned I request a lot of grilled onions. My order came with all the the veggies and ketchup, everything was there but the grilled onions I requested!  NEVER AGAIN!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=60

Monica F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",635,94,191,5.0,8/25/2015,"I had a great experience here. We were seated right away. We had a really awesome server who had a great understanding of the menu. She was super friendly and made conversation (but not too much lol). She helped me make my own concoction of my food.  I had been to another Cheesecake Factory previously and remembered having some kind of pasta with pink sauce. I described the dish to her, and she said that they don't really have an item on the menu that has ""pink sauce"". She recommended something that a lot of other people have ordered, which is a combination sauce made out of alfredo sauce and marinara sauce. This was a perfect mixture and fulfilled my craving for what I was wanting. She made sure that I was happy with the food that she helped me create. The lemon drop drink was very good.

I ventured in the Sunday brunch menu and found ""chilaquiles!"" - one of my favorite Mexican dishes.  The plate came in with a generous portion as it is typical of The Cheescake Factory, but it looked like a large bowl of Nachos with pieces of scrambled eggs and a few chunks of fried pork (carnitas). It didn't look  like chilaquiles.  Maybe the item was incorrectly named and should have been labeled as 'Breakfast Nachos' or it simply was a rendition created by someone who has never eaten Chilaquiles.  Either was it was just a bit disappointing.

Even though the server was very nice he never refilled our drinks something that is not acceptable. Then I order my usual dish: carbonara pasta. First they bring me an empty dish of pasta so I told them to bring the usual amount of pasta. Then when I tried it the taste was disgusting! Super mega salty, the bacon was not cooked well, the pasta undercooked. I had to return my dish and ordered chicken strips with French fries. I ended eating alone because the whole party was eating, even though the dishes weren't as they used to be. Furthermore the server never pick up the things empty from the table and the table was a total mess.

Mig L.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",5,6,1,4.0,10/5/2015,"The strongest happy hour in the mall. Also the most bang for your buck.  Either come with friends and split several appetizers weighing in at $5.50 or crush their skinny cocktails that don't skip on the bite and cost the same. I prefer a little of both. Bartenders close to excellent on mixing their various combinations of moonstone and long islands.  I appreciate the bread regardless of solo dining or not. I've been here 30+ times now and can only remember two times when I've felt a little bothered by their service. Their items on the happy hour menu are still big for the costs and I find myself taking some home often. All in all you can get a little buzz and food in you for under $20 which is always good feeling.

Hope P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1497,746,9059,4.0,4/19/2014,"Solid four stars. My fiancé was turned off from ordering a burger at Cheesecake many years ago, and I urged him to try this restaurant chain again. We found out at the busy hostess circle that we'd be seated in 10 mins it seemed shorter than that to me.  This Aventura Mall location seems busy every time Im here. You will also hear almost every language but English customers in the restaurant. We come before going to a movie at the AMC in the Mall. The service is always great. We had waters and they kept them filled.  I ordered the Caprese mozarella pizza it was thin crust, great cheese and flavor. I gave my man a bite and he said it reminded him of the pizza from Italy. I recommend the pizza. The Smokehouse BBQ burger made with onion rings, bacon and cheese.  The burger was well crafted and the side of fries come in a wax paper cone in a metal spiral holder, so not that many fries come with the burger -he didnt complain. It was a great burger. We came back and ordered dishes for dinner that were great. Got a Slice of the Linda's layered chocolate cake to go.. I must say as a chocolate lover I compare every piece of cake to it, and none make the cut.  Cheesecake Factory really makes outstanding desserts. The layers of chocolate icing and moist chocolate cake and topped off with chocolate chips up the side and served with whip cream. I really love this cake! Another fav is Godiva chocolate cheese cake as a chocolate lover I even had ordered one for my birthday one year! My man is a red velvet cake fan. Some places don't come close to red velvet, Cheesecake Factory knows what's up in desserts. Great place for good service and good food and atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=80

First, the waiter took about 10 minutes to take our drink order. From there, it did get a little better, but not much. As for food, the chicken romano was the worst I had ever had. It looked like they cut a chicken breast into at least 3 layers, it was that thin. Half of it was just burnt breading with no meat visable.

NOT! 5) someone else brought us the food 6) didn't see my waiter for another 10 min after I was done with my lunch 7) had to ask ANOTHER  waiter for a to go box 8) asked ANOTHER waiter for the check and a to go cheesecake, he himself told me he couldn't find my waiter. 9) was on a timed lunch due to the fact my friend had to pick up her son.

My fiancé order the Smokehouse burger and I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and it was my first time having the dish. It was so good.  I can honestly say that it was hot and fresh and the ingredients were well worth it.  The dish is kind of spicy but if you can handle the heat then definitely make it an option the next time you are there.  The only thing that I didn't too much care for was the Crispy Crab Wonton. When we ordered them they were hot and crispy but the filling with the crab was not too tasty for me. I can't really put my finger on it but I just didn't like it too much.  I've had Crab Wonton from other Asian restaurants and they were really good. But this one I did not like.  But overall besides that the service was great and the food. I will definetly be back here over and over again.

Our server came up to the table and just looked like she was in the weeds. She took our drink and app order and quickly ran off to tend to other tables. She comes back with one drink. She forgot if I got a Pinot Grigio or Pinot noir. No biggy, it happens, but hey if your weeded you should probably write things down. The food runner that dropped off the app was very pleasant, she even refilled our waters. My wine got to the table mid app and we placed our food order. I asked for no tomato add avocado, and she seemed a little confused, she may have been new to the menu. Our server delivers the food and it's perfect but then she wasn't seen for a while.

When we were all done she stopped by and we asked for the check, she grabbed another water for my boyfriend and we decided to not get a cheesecake.

Brenda D.,"Mississauga, Canada",35,67,114,3.0,12/6/2014,"Background: My husband and I were looking for a place to eat a late lunch so we decided on Cheesecake Factory because it's familiar territory. I ordered the skinny licious soft chicken taco and husband ordered mushroom, spinach, bacon and cheese omelet that came with a side of potatoes and toast. Order came up to $40 for the two meals plus an iced mint green tea.  The Good: - The wait time for two people on a Saturday at around 3 was less than ten minutes  - We were seated in an area where we had plenty of room unlike some parts of the restaurant where you are practically touching your neighbor - Waiter came fairly quickly to take order  - The menu is in itself a book! Tons and tons of options.  - The bread provided was nice and warm  -  My husband commented that the omelet was flavourful.  The Bad: - The tables around us who came after got their food much quicker than we did. It wasn't too big of a deal but we were starving!!! - I asked for extra cilantro and crema on my tacos but it didn't come with it. The waiter did ask if the request was fulfilled but I was too shy to say no so I guess that was my fault.  - The tacos themselves were pretty bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour and it just didn't have too much flavour overall. I was very disappointed actually. I understand that it's supposed to be part of the skinny licious menu but a little more oomph wouldn't have hurt.  Summary: I think I would go back to another Cheesecake Factory but wouldn't order these tacos again. It's a great place for groups of people because there's tons of choices. As well, the cheesecakes are pretty good especially if you want to take one home to eat later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=100

The cheesecake might as well have been jello instant box cheesecake for all the flavor it had, and the coffee was so bitter I could barely drink it. The cheesecake was grainy and gritty, and didn't have much flavor. The waiter was attentive, but a little pushy, seemed annoyed to be waiting on us for just 2 slices of cheesecake and 2 coffees. Was really trying to push the dinner menu on us and talking over us. Once he realized we were just there for dessert he kept trying to pressure us into different choices than what we wanted. Clientele was mostly bourgeois yuppie housewives in ugg boots who seemed to think the food was just this side of heaven. Maybe it was, but the dessert was very pedestrian. The atmosphere was like a noisy cafeteria, tables packed in so tight you are practically in the laps of the people next to you. They were herding people in and out like cattle.

Steak Diane, the wine drenched angus steak with mash potatoes and onions (my most recent fave), the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and the chicken enchiladas (with accompanying white rice and black beans). The avocado wraps make great appetizers (if you can squeeze that in with the main plate). The hefty portions are beyond generous. The Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and fresh strawberry cheesecake are both delicious but the main dish usually never leaves much room for dessert.

Jouberte M.,"Miami Beach, FL",81,3,2,1.0,11/10/2016,"Rudest manager experience I have ever had. I order a combo, salmon and steak, steak medium rare and it came out extremely rare. My very nice server came, took it to get cooked up for me. When it came back it was well done, so she  had them start my whole plate over. New person brought me a whole new plate but with chicken. As I do not eat chicken I gave it to my companion as my server didn't come back for a few minutes. The steak was again well done again and at this point I no longer feel like eating, but the server sends out the steak (hopefully cooked correctly) in a to go bag. When we ask for the check, my dish is still on it. Given that it was sent back as many times as it was I figured I at least given a discount, having not been able to eat my meal. So the manager comes out and very rudely says that we should be thankful because I got 3 plates for the price of one.... meaning the 3 plates that were messed up and were sent back. She then asked where the chicken on the 3rd plate went, and I said my friend took it since I don't eat chicken. She then said that she would have to charge my friend for it if she was going to take it, even though we never ordered it. Mind you, it's not just what she is saying, its the eye rolling and condescension. Rather than have them toss , since I already pushed it around with my fork, I gave it to my friend. It is their fault for giving me the wrong dish. She then made my friend take it out of her to go box and put it on a plate to throw away! At this point I'm beyond upset and tell her to take my packed side (the fourth attempt to get it right) and to just take it all off of the check. She was so nasty and condescending the whole time, and refused to tell me her name. I promptly asked for another manger who was much more understanding and apologized on the other woman's behalf. I know it's a casual restaurant but  I expect the management to at the very least be civilized.

The prices are reasonable given the portions and they have a very diverse menu with selections to please almost everyone. The ambiance was very dark and loud.

Karoline G.,"Hvidovre, Denmark",0,5,,3.0,9/2/2016,"We ate at this location visiting Aventura mall, and USA for the first time. I had fish tacos and my boyfriend had a chicken dish. Food was ok, and service ok - nothing absolutely extraordinary but we were satisfied. We asked for our cheesecakes to go. When the time came to paying the bill, we left what was asked for, plus a few extra $$ for tips. After the server picked up the check and counted the money, he quickly returned asking for us to follow the tipping guidelines on the bottom of the check asking us to add between 18-35% of the meal! I guess this is the norm in the US, but since it's our first time in the states we didn't know and it made us feel pretty awkward. I think a 18% tip is very high - and yes I know, it's a way to keep the wages down for servers, but 12-15 usd for one paying customer (and he probably have 30-50 customers a day) 6-7 days a week is 11.500 usd a month! I have now learned the way to tip in USA, and when coming to a different culture you have to follow the norm, but I tell you.. It is a corruptive system, that you have to pay extra to get the service you are paying for through the price on the menu. Anywho.. It's just my opinion.

She was pleasant and gave us extra time as we decided on what to order from their huge menu.... ***The only complaint I must add was dirty small plates when we were seated.  Seems like they don't take the time or measures to properly clean their plates... We just used our napkins to eat the bread that they provide at the table and didn't want to ask for any ""new"" plates.  We were in the mood for a burger (and didn't want Johnny rockets upstairs) so we decided on the Kobe style burger and the Americana burger. I must admit we were a little optimistic about THIS place for burgers-BUT they were surprisingly good.  I devoured the Americana burger which has a delicious ""secret sauce"" which is a combination of ketchup mayo and what i believe are chopped capers ? With a slice of American and cheddar cheese, you cannot go wrong.  My husband had the Kobe style burger which he said was good, but wasn't crazy about the sweet taste of the BBQ-like sauce mixed with the onions and mushrooms.   For dessert we decided on the Reese's PB chocolate cheesecake - amazing and delicious!

So I got to the mall and parking took around 10 min to find. When I walked in the host greeted me and I put my name down for a party of 2 and she said it would take around 10 min to be seated. We got called and then escorted to our table. When we got to our table I did not like the location of the table they were trying to give us. It was in a corner near the kitchen and a lot of movement went by there and I wanted to get a booth or a area not near the kitchen and where I would be able to sit next to my girlfriend. When I told the host that I didn't want to sit there and if he could accommodate us at another table.  He rudely said ""go back to the host desk and ask for a new table"". This tone and comment just gave me a really bad impression and I wasn't going to spend nearly $80 dollars for really bad service.

Paul W.,"Miami, FL",877,1201,548,4.0,10/13/2009,"Normally I'd never give 4 stars to a chain restaurant such as The Cheesecake Factory, but when I met some friends for dinner here a few nights ago, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.  One of the things I noted in a past review of another Cheesecake Factory location was that I felt they needed to reduce the huge size of their portions to something a bit more manageable, and at the same time reduce their pricing accordingly. I'd always felt like a stuffed pig after eating at one of these restaurants, and would leave nearly as much uneaten food on the plate as I'd consumed, as their portions were so large.  During this weekend's visit, it seemed they finally got it right. I ordered the chicken and cashew salad from their ""specialties"" menu. It was $12 which is reasonable, the portion size was manageable (though there were only 3 or 4 small strips of chicken in the salad - a bit on the stingy side) and for the first time ever at one of these restaurants, I felt I had enough room at the end of the meal to enjoy a slice of their namesake dessert - cheesecake.  I'll also say that, though parking was next to impossible on this night (I ended up parking about a city block away and hiking), our party of 4 was seated quickly, especially considering the place was full of patrons. Also, the service was excellent on this night, our waiter was attentive and stopped by several times to offer refills on water or drinks, the food was served relatively quickly and the staff was friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=160

Waitress with the long red hair said nothing. That's okay, she probably didn't hear us. Again my friend asked another question to the lady. ""Excuse me?"" After she finally gave us her full attention, she answered with a ""Yes?"" OH lord this lady is trying it. My friend asked for a menu  again (mind you, we asked her twice.) Finally the lady gave us a take out menu... Now if I wanted a take out menu, I would've waited at the take out order line.

Basically, no one finished their meals instead of my dad...actually he didn't really finish because he gave 3-4 of his wings to us. We never had a chance to try out their cheesecakes because we were always too stuffed. It must be awesome since it's called The Cheesecake Factory. Would I go here again?

Megan M.,"Hollywood, FL",459,522,920,4.0,4/18/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory bring back so many memories for me. I've had dates here, I had drinks here for my 21st birthday, and this location was a special spot for my girlie date nights with Tiffany T. back in high school and summers home from college.  I don't think I've ever had bad service here. Some experiences have been better than others, but never a bad time. I have a love/hate relationship with their menu because there are TOO many choices. I try to get something different every time, but I usually end up picking from just a few things I know I love. Their chicken salad sandwich and the Chicken Costoletta are both delicious and enough for 2-3 meals. I always get a side salad with the vinaigrette with the sandwich, and the Costoletta dish comes with potatoes and asparagus. Believe me when I say, they are HUGE. I also love their lettuce wraps, and I like that in recent years, they've expanded their menu to add small plates. I had the chicken croquettes and pork buns recently and both were really yummy, and it was inexpensive, especially for the portion. Their cheesecakes are amazing, of course. My favorite is the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. That just sounds decadent, doesn't it? It definitely is, but split it because it's way too rich to eat the whole thing.  I usually avoid chains, but Cheesecake Factory is one that I like, and although the food isn't even close to the quality of what you'd get at some of Miami's finer restaurants, it is tasty and a good value. My only complaint about this location is that there is always a wait.

My friend's buffalo chicken bites were huge and looked very good. I was to busy eating my nachos to try.

For dinner we both opted for the Teriyaki Chicken. You have the choice of bone in or not; pick the bone in one since it seems much more moist.  And for desert, we always choose the Tirimisu desert, not the cheese cake.  So why the 2 stars? I believe Cheesecake Factory does many things well, but they only do cheese cakes exceptional. I ordered a steak one time here and it came overcooked despite me advising the sever that it has to be rare.  When the steak came that time, the plate was super hot telling me that the runner or server left it under the heating lamp too long and sure enough, it was medium. The server gladly took it back and the manager brought a new one to me. It was super rare which is fine and I enjoyed it. The meat was red but not a deep red color as when you would get beef from a butcher shop. This quality of meat was inferior and that's what I meant by their menu being large and serving it all.  Also, we ordered take out last week and were looking forward to enjoy our dinner while watching a move at the drive-in at Swap Shops. While we enjoyed our humus, when we finally got to the Teriyaki Chicken, there were no utensils. I called Scott the manager and he offered nothing but an apology. Now imagine you're in the middle of watching a movie, and about to eat your dinner, but now you're completely distracted because the moron handling the take out decides to not pay attention and leaves you no way to eat. So now instead of watching the movie, you're scratching your head on how you and your wife are supposed to eat dinner. Needless to say, management here needs much improvement.

Explained to him our situation, without even finishing our sentence he had the audacity to say that we'll give you a booth because that's what you want. He didn't even apologize or took the time to listen to us, he automatically took defense of his staff and dismissed us. The food was as lousy as the servicw.

Elizabeth P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",293,224,287,4.0,9/8/2012,"Love the location right inside the Aventura Mall, convenient after a long day of shopping.  It was really busy and crowded on a Saturday night but the service was still very good and fast.  The food is as good as it gets at a Cheesecake Factory.   Love their menu which provides a large variety of dishes.  And now they have the new Skinnylicious menu items which provides the low-cal dishes.  Despite my best efforts, I do have one weakness which is their bread basket ... which I honestly try very hard to ignore but  that yummy soft warm bread calls out my name till resistance becomes futile.  Then, to feel less guilty, I'll have their tuna tataki salad ... perhaps accompanied by a glass of wine.  Ok, then after that, my second weakness kicks in... a little bite (or 2 or 3) of one of their famous cheesecakes.  So much for ""Skinnylicious.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=200

Our server was an older man named Bob. He seemed put out and bothered by waiting on us. Once our food came he never came back to check on us. We had to flag him down to get drink refills, cheese for the pasta and malt vinegar for the fish and chips.  The food was subpar. Not great,  but we were hungry and it was edible. Bob did make sure to ask if we wanted dessert,  then never came back to take our order. We had to flag him down again. The restaurant wasn't super busy. Bob seemed to spend a lot of time on the computers which happened to be next to our table.  When I got his attention and asked for the bill he huffed and got it and slammed it on the table.

This is my first time in this location, in a saturday afternoon, and I don't recommend it at all. The food was OK, as in any other cheesecake factory. However, the place was extremely crowded, and after a 20+ min wait, I experienced one of the worst customer service experience of my entire life. First of all, we ordered a Strawberry margarita and we got a regular one. We also ordered a beer and they brought it to us when we were finishing our food, after we remind the different server more than three times (the last time I inquired about the beer I ordered the most disgusting red hair lady almost yell at me that ""your server will bring that to you"". Finally the beer came (not cold), and finally we had to wait about 15min for the check.

Inas A.,"Davie, FL",0,12,20,1.0,7/23/2015,"Yesterday I was in the Aventura area and me and family decided to get something to eat. We walked in and gave our name. The wait was 30 minutes so we went to walk around. We got a text saying our table was ready. We were right outside so we went to the counter and said we got the text so they told us to wait towards the window so we did. They then proceeded to call several other tables while we waited for almost 20 minutes. We went up to the counter twice within the 20 minutes to tell them we were waiting. On the second time we went up to the counter the lady told us ""We called you, you didn't hear us"" Which after she said that I was appalled. Forgetting about that we were taken to our table by another lady. When we got to the table it was covered with bread crumbs and spilt drinks. We then had to stand for 5 minutes while the bus boys cleaned the table and set it for us. When she was placing the menus down we asked why we didn't get a booth (another party of four came a sat down right after us) she said ""Those are for parties of 6"" even though they were the same number party as us. Our waiter came right after we had sat down and asked for our orders and then took our drink orders. We waited for the food. We got our fire roasted artichokes and they were supposed to be served warm but were slightly warm on the inside and cold on the outside. We called the manager to ask if they were supposed to be served cold or hot because different restaurants serve them in different ways. It took an average amount of time to get the rest of the food. The food was okay we got three entrées and one appetizers. We started eating and it was all fine. Then as we were eating my brother found plastic in his shepards pie. We told the server and he called a manager. When the manager came he apologized and said he doesn't know where that could have come from. He said he would take care of it and took the plate. We asked for the check and some boxes to take the other entrées. We payed and left. Over all this was a horrible experience and something I would never expect from this location. Most likely not returning to the location. I would stick to the Sawgrass Mills Mall location.

I do like the restaurant, but only because it is consistent but certainly not exceptional.  THINGS TO TRY:  ...Any salad is good and can be shared for 2+ people O ...Lettuce wraps are solid and nicely prepared  ...Fried shrimp, it is good, but I don't believe they prepare them in the restaurant, they appear to be from a big old frozen bag  ...They make a good hamburger  ... Asparagus omelet  What i don't like is that they seem to use a lot of prepackaged foods that are defrosted and cooked on premise.  BONUS TIME: If you luck out and get a good bartender, they make a good martini.  BIG TIP 1: Look for seats at the bar first, it is first come first seated and will save you a 45 minute wait.  BIG TIP 2: They make lunch sizes of entrees, so you can save some coin and the portion is basically normal restaurant size.

Natalie P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",290,206,28,3.0,1/6/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you know what you're getting. Stopped in for a quick late night dinner with a girlfriend after seeing a movie. We were seated within 5 minutes, but as usual, the restaurant was super noisy and the air conditioning was turned down waaaaay too cold! Service was decent, nothing great or above average, but it was satisfactory. Our server was friendly but not outgoing, and did the minimum but didn't try to make a connection. My friend had a chicken salad and I had the avocado egg rolls. Her salad was full of goodies and she said it was good. My egg rolls were tasty (as usual) but they were a little soggy, I suspect they were sitting under the heating lamp for awhile. A big peeve of mine is that at this location they never give me enough dipping sauce! I know it's something small but come on, fill up the teeny tiny little saucer that it comes in! For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake which is ridiculous and to die for. I love (love love love love) red velvet, and combined with cheesecake you just can't go wrong! Overall, service is acceptable, but don't expect to be wooed. Food is good, just exactly what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory.

I addresed him staying that the table was wet and if there was something to clean it with. He said yes. Did not even apologised. Went to another table to check on his guest across from us and we waited almost a good 10 minutes before he came back only to find out the utensils were all dirty as well. Poorley washed and one knife seemed as if someone just cut into a slice of cake. So i started to help him clear the plates and utensils. He still didn't apologise so we left. Speaking with a manager we tried to have us stay. How can you eat in a restaurant that has filthy utensils and is not clean.  Manager should ask herself would she sit and eat after that?

But we dealt with that and Im not the type to get turned off by possible mistakes. HOWEVER, as we order dessert, we get our tea and our server brings the sugar packet holder. Then this other server (female employee that isn't our server) grabs the sugar packet holder and walks away. She didn't ask if we were done, she didn't make any eye contact, she just took it as she was walking. I watched her in disbelief. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she was going to refill it. But no, she walked to a table of hers and put it down for her customers.  When she passed by our table, I stopped her and told her she should ask if we are done with it before snatching it off. And this girl lies right in my face. Saying I don't know what you are talking about, she said she would be right back. You think she was back? Not at all. She used another route, avoiding my table. That fueled the anger and complaining to the manager did nothing. All he did was ask if we were done and said sorry. So basically they shooed us away. Are you serious?

Donna M.,"Miami, FL",0,21,,1.0,10/10/2015,"I've been going to this location since it opened and it has only gotten worse with time.  We arrived at 10pm after a movie upstairs and it wasn't that busy.  We decided to wait for a bar table.  We sat there for 40 minutes watching the waitress flirt with a customer and ignore us - she even had the nerve to serve people at a table next to us who came in 15 minutes after us.  They had been served their drinks and were having their orders taken by her and she just totally ignored our attempts to get her attention. At some point I got up and went to the front to get menus so we could at least decide on what we wanted. We were very hungry. I went to speak to the manager and he did nothing - he had zero management skills.  Finally we started asking every staff person who walked by if anyone was going to serve us after 40 minutes.  Finally a waiter appeared and took our drink orders which took forever. He came back with the drinks and bread, but no plates or utensils.  We asked for the utensils and he said he would bring them right away.  He didn't, 10 more minutes passed and I had to get up and get plates and utensils from another table.  Finally he showed up 5 more minutes later, with the plates and utensils, apologizing. Then we ordered food.  My order was wrong, I asked for the chicken salad on brioche and I got a omelet and bacon sandwich.  Not sure how that mistake could be made by a waiter!  My dinner companion had finished eating by the time my correct order arrived.  All I can say is NEVER order the chicken salad on brioche sandwich.  It was the most wretched food item I have ever eaten.  A couple of spoonfuls of dry, tasteless chicken salad on dry, state toasted bread with a slice of tomato and piece of lettuce!!!!!  For $15?????  HORRIBLE!  I found myself wishing I had kept the omelet sandwich.  There weren't even that many people in the restaurant at the time, and there were a LOT of staff.  Terrible management, clearly they don't know what they are doing.  What a shame.  I doubt I will ever go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=260

The service at this location is always on point and never lacking.  I can honestly say I've never had bad service here, a decade running. I was here on Sunday, after I attended a family baby shower, to have lunch with my love who had been playing Racket Ball nearby with friends.  There was a minor wait, and before we could even think about walking out and going somewhere else, the host was calling our name to be seated.  I always enjoy sitting outdoors here and was glad that our table was there. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable on all the menu items.  Since I had just eaten at Bimini Boatyard I was interested in one thing and one thing only...  CHEESECAKE!  Although, I did have some of the BF's stuffed mushrooms (TO DIE FOR!!!) and the calamari, which was ok, but nothing special.  I enjoyed a Pomegranate Mojito which was very tasty and followed it with a White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecake.   Our friends ordered the Orange Chicken and some kind of a taco/burrito/gordita looking chicken sandwich, whose name escapes me.  Both of the plates looked phenomenal and tasty.  Usually, I like to order either the Chicken Marsala or the Madeira, or their pastas which are ALL just ridiculously, lick-the-plate-clean GOOD! Thank you for being so reliable and delicious.  For years I have eaten here and I always know that if I am at the mall, I can count on you to stave off the hunger pangs in the most delightful way possible.

We ordered the Chicken Marsala for the first time ever and it was just OK. It's truly not their specialty I guess. We should have stuck to our normal safe choice, but we veered... anyway... My real gripe and the reason for the 3 stars instead of more is because of the unnecessary long wait and the host staff acting like if they are the high priests of ""Cheescake Factory Gates of Heaven"". No matter how busy it is, I like to be received with a smile and I don't like to wait more than necessary. The girl there did not give my wife a pager when she put our names in because they were so full they ran out, but told her it would be 30 minutes anyway.

Richard E.,"Hollywood, FL",40,28,3,3.0,10/30/2011,"Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory today.  Went to the one in Aventura and while the service was good, the food was overcooked and the mens room was a mess.  Ordered a Kobe burger med-rare and it came out well done.  Lemon Ricotta pancakes were too hot to eat.  Usually get much better food from this chain.  Maybe it was just an off day?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=280

I've always wanted to try the appetizers but the entree portions are SO big I can't even finish that...I don't know why they even bother having appetizers!

Duana M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",151,158,37,4.0,2/27/2011,"This reviews is several YEARS overdue. My family lives in Aventura and on weekends, Id go and visit. For lunch/dinner I would stop here because the food is undeniably amazing. This has been my favorite location between Miami and Orlando :-). On three separate occasions I have visited this restaurant and  there would be some sort of issue. What I ordered had suddenly ran out, or something I ordered, just wouldn't be ready for me to eat at a reasonable time. This restaurant is always busy. But the lines and wait is always worth it. So anyhow, whenever there was a problem with my food, I always had the acquaintance of Chris. Hes professional and caring. A great manager. Always offers something to replace whatever I couldn't have on the house, and once I got desert. (Their cheesecake is to die for!) I have never had a sour time eating here, because I know that if I'm unable to get what I want I can at the very least leave with an apology, and I'll be taken care of.

I ordered a  Caesar salad and a small pizza and found a large wooden skewer underneath the pizza. I called waiter to let her know what I had found and she apologized and called the manager. The manager came over and offered to bring me another pizza. I said I was turned off by the whole experience and I turned down her new pizza offer. She just gave me the stink eye and walked away.

Brent H.,"Denver, CO",1,5,,1.0,6/26/2010,"Very poor service and food quality.  I have visited this location many time left very disappointed.  Our server  was unfamiliar with the menu, most specifically how the Carmel Chicken was prepared.  We asked if the chicken was grilled and he replied that yes it was, when it came out it was fried in batter.  We also ordered an appetizer of  chicken pot-stickers which never arrived.  Once our food was delivered no checked on us to see how the food was, offer us more beverages.  We asked for the check and waited and waited and waited.  After presenting a credit card it was returned with no check slip to sign.  We tipped 13% but left feeling that was 10% to much for such poor service.  Overall just a very poor service experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=300

I went on a date night w my boyfriend and asked if they sold the lemon butter sauce from my favorite dish; the chicken piccata, just as they sell their salad dressings.

No matter what I order  here it is all good. Salads are generous and freaking amazing. Their blue cheese dressing is made in heaven I assure you. The appetizers are so good: mac and cheese balls (it's fried and mac and cheese, omg!), avocado egg rolls, the huge factory nachos, and lettuce wraps just to name a few. The entrees: chicken romano, chicken littles (a mountain of chicken with mashed potato), chicken picatta, the bbq chicken sandwich are all favorites.

Rob C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1616,4663,178,4.0,3/23/2009,"located in Aventura mall similar decor as Grand Lux, so don't get confused and park near the wrong one at night, because when the mall closes, it's a long walk to your car (or wait for a shuttle) this location is always crowded like any other cheesecake (peak wait times can be more than 45 min) there's something on the menu for everyone, and it's standardized good stuff with large portions which I guess keeps bringing everyone back, this place has done well, standing the test of time and earning their solid reputation personally, i usually get a burger or a sandwich like the grilled eggplant one advantage with the long wait i suppose, is that at least you can walk around the mall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=300
Melissa V.,"Hollywood, FL",225,206,135,4.0,3/12/2009,"I used to come here a lot with my mother when I was a teen, then it stopped because of the long wait.. Ralph and I picked this spot since we had to get our rings checked at the mall, plus I needed to buy something from M.A.C. make-up store that I ran out of at home. Oh, I am definitely into this restaurant for the cheesecakes, too. But, food is definitely great, too. Ralph called before getting there to make a reservation but it was impossible for some reason. So, I went straight to the Cheesecake Factory to the host to tell her I needed a table (and mentioned that it was to celebrate our 3rd yr anniversary, which was true.) Her face kind of lighted up and said it could be ready around 20 minutes. I was never given the vibrating pager, which I found out. Oh, well. I said that I could be back in 30 minutes instead and checked my watch at the same time and rushed in the mall with Ralph and did what we had to do. I got back inside maybe 5 minutes late. I waved at the same hostess and she said to wait a moment. Then, another 5 minutes passed by, some guy in white uniform called out my name really loud in front of me. lol.. I was right there.  The waitress was a cool girl, who had sense of humor and a great smile. We first went with the spicy chicken salad. We should have ordered the Luau one, but next time. We also shared an appetizer of avocado egg rolls, which was heavens to both of us. I decided to get a Passion Fruit Mojito. It was delicious. I really appreciate the fact that our waitress (sorry, I wish I remembered her name) warned us that we might not like the Pomegranate Mojito. She said that the pomegranate might not blend in well with the mint in the drink and many people didn't like it. That was nice of her to point out. :) Then, we went for the Splenda cheesecake with fresh strawberries and whip cream. I usually get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, however, I wanted to be nicer to myself by not gaining too much of the sugar since I've already been drinking two of the tall glasses of passion fruit mojitos. I was almost knocked out when I got home. Very nice way to mini celebrate out 3 years of being together before marriage. :) I love Ralph!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-aventura?start=300

Jules R.,"Westchester County, NY",3,60,,3.0,8/24/2011,"Went here on a Saturday night with family and the wait wasn't exactly my favorite part. We got there around 7:30 and were told our wait time was 45 minutes. Part of the reason why the wait was so long was because we opted for indoor seating since half the outdoor seating was unavailable due to wet seats from the rain. It ended up being closer to an hour but once you get seated and order, it doesn't take long for the negative of the wait to go away. Overcrowded both inside and out. Our waitress was at least nice. The floors are filthy looking and it's obvious that they don't take a broom every few hours and sweep the used napkins, forks and straw wrappers from under the table. I kind of just wanted to get out of here as fast as I could. I ordered the Tomato, Basil and Cheese pizza which was good. I got the red velvet cheesecake to take home and I was a happy camper when I ate it!

They gave me a baquette that was very hard, stale and had actual mold on it and there was 2 slices of turkey and and tomato seeds from the left behind tomato. no white toast, mayo, bacon?? The french fries were missing completely. The third item shrimp scampi no tomato extra sauce. Shrimp raw, no sauce on dish and a little sauce on side filled to the brim with tomatoes. Called JASON manager there(cant believe this is who is in charge) laughed and said he would not help, didnt even sound appauled. I asked for a higher up and refused to answer and hung up.
