For a chain, the burgers are pretty damn good and never taste frozen. Nice selection of appetizers. The onion rings are really good, but what makes them even better are the dipping sauces that accompany them!! Fried zucchini, mmmmm....... I really like the fact that you can order any burger lettuce wrapped instead of on a bun!!!  Great for those of us that watch our carbs!!  Service is usually very good.

Although the burger was presented nicely, the burger patty was dry and gray with a touch of pink in the middle and no seasoning.  When are cooks going to stop pressing on the patty on the grill it does nothing but delete the meat of all the juices. I could not taste the blue cheese and the bacon so think it was had to find under the bun. The all you can eat frys were OK - not bad but not fantastic either.

73,Freyjah S.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,3,,2.0,2012-10-05,"The Pros: Lot's of hamburger choices with various toppings and hamburger buns, endless french fry options, no charge for replacing fries with a healthier alternative such as a salad. The Cons: Your waitress will leave and other waitresses will bring your food/ wait on you only for your original waitress to re-appear at the end asking for a tip. Loud children everywhere, can't hear yourself talk.  Overall: Disappointing experience overall. My first time at Red Robin and it will probably be the last. Within a one hour span I've never heard a ""birthday chant"" repeated so many times in my life...This restaurant seems to cater exclusively to families with kids. The restaurant was noisy both from the kids and the people cooking the food (me and my mother were seated at a table located right next to the kitchen. The cook had to scream in order to be heard over the overall ""loudness"" of the restaurant itself.)   Recommendations: Go to this restaurant if you want a big hamburger with endless french fries! Otherwise, stay far far away. This is not a good date spot nor is it a quite place to enjoy a meal and chat with friends. I highly recommend just doing their take-out option.

Food was consistent with other Red Robin locations.  Really, isn't this what a chain is about?  Onion rings were hot and well coated, dip was nice.  Hamburger was exactly as it should be, even when a kid ordered medium rare.  Waiter offered to upgrade me to a bowl from a cup of soup.  Can't blame a guy for trying.  Drinks were filled as needed.  Restrooms were clean.  Check came out promptly.

Slowly, I have begun to visit the many restaurants there. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers is one of the offerings.   I stopped in for a late lunch last week when I had an urge for a good slider, but something better than the fast food variety, less greasy than Five Guys, and priced for most of us (sorry, Smashburger). Red Robin was bright and airy, with glass walls, high ceilings, and effective lighting.  As I approached, the front door was opened for me by a greeter who welcomed me and pointed toward the angled bar when I asked if I could sit there for lunch.   The bartender approached easily, asking if I wanted a drink and menu.  Indeed, I did.  The All American Patty Melt (medium) and Ice Tea would do me, thank you.  My meal arrived within 10 minutes on a large platter that held the Grilled Marble Rye Sandwich, the aluminum collar holding vertical French Fries, and a small container of dipping sauce.  After lifting the top lid and squirting ketchup over the Sautéed Onion and Pepper Jack Cheese that covered the beef, I lifted the first half of the triangle for a bite.  It was very good. Accurately medium finish; never frozen patty that held its shape throughout; softly translucent sweet onion and mildly spicy cheese.  Do so love a properly created patty melt!  But, it was a bit leaky with so much pressed within its rigid borders, that I resorted to fork and knife to devour the rest of it.   All the while, good rock & roll played a mix of songs I like, the HDTVs broadcast sports and news without sound, and the customer at the stool to my right kept the bartender occupied with a string of commentary about various innocuous topics.  I was happily alone with my tasty lunch.   With soft drink, the meal came in at just under $15, with tip.  Quite a deal for the enjoyment of good burger, attractive surroundings, and a little peace and solitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.3120000000000003,3.92

0,Dana g.,"Monroe Township, NJ",1,36,17.0,5.0,2017-06-17,Love this place. Service is always great! They are accurate in their wait time and service is always perfect! The menu is plentiful and everything is always fresh. The wait service is always friendly and happy Robbie there. I love that I can get burgers wrapped in lettuce and not worry about all of the carbs. This is one of my favorite burger joints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
36,Monica O.,"Merion Station, PA",46,6,9.0,4.0,2017-07-06,Not my favorite have tried several ones in different towns and I have to say this one is pretty good. Staff is friendly and fast to bring the bottomless fries I recommend ordering a sauce for the the fries the garlic is delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
35,D And C C.,"Trenton, NJ",1,12,1.0,2.0,2017-07-10,"We stopped here for the first time in years on Sunday, July 9, 2017.   The burgers were prepared exactly as we ordered, and that's the good news. The not so good?   Well, the restrooms were not clean at all.  The service was hit-miss.   Our food came reasonably quickly, but we missed out on the ""bottomless"" fries.   Our waiter never returned to our table after our food was dropped off until we asked for our check.   So there was a full 20-30 minutes where no one asked or offered the bottomless fries refill.   Sure we could have randomly stopped someone else who worked there, but it would have been nice if our waiter had checked in on us at least every once in a while.  And no, the waiter wasn't spread thin  just didn't bother to stop by.   There also weren't that many tables seated at the time so stopping by just wasn't a priority. We probably won't be going back again to this location.   There are other Red Robin locations with better service and cleaner so we'll just skip this spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
3,Frank A.,"Levittown, PA",1,17,,4.0,2017-07-12,Celebrated the wife's birthday with the free birthday burger. Actually she wanted a chicken salad but our server said she had to order a burger. So she ordered the Shrum burger and I the salad. We then switched dinners when our food arrived. As always we enjoyed our food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
28,Jordan C.,"Trenton, NJ",0,12,1.0,2.0,2017-07-26,"Ate there with a friend on Saturday.  Both my husband and friend felt stomach pains about 20 minutes or left after leaving there, you can guess! Their fries were soggy, seemed like leftovers from another customer! My burger was ""Meh"" and cold. Not a great experience. We won't be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
37,Amanda L.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",123,18,4.0,5.0,2017-08-10,"Always on top of their game, no matter how big your party is. Delicious appetizers, menu choices, and sauces.

22,Tatiana W.,"Little Falls, NJ",47,76,93.0,3.0,2017-11-03,"Server was great even though very busy. Had two spots while waiting for the rest of our party. Had the pretzels pieces  with beer cheese dip and the fried pickle nickels with the Ranch dressing for dipping. Both were very good. The pickles although a bit greasy were not overly spiced or salty like most are and were tasty as well. Having filled Up in spots I ordered a soup and salad combo. Had the loaded cream of potato soup -new to menu. It was tasty and plenty loaded with cheddar and bacon pieces but it did taste like a big dollop  of sour cream was stirred in. It could have been hotter for my taste.  The salad was the house salad with lettuce, chopped tomato, cucumber, shredded cheese and carrots. It was fresh and crisp and the blue cheese dressing was adequate.  One complaint, being near the kitchen with a straight on view into the kitchen -it was very messy. The floor was very wet, I do not know how any employees didn't skip and fall! There were paper sheets that may have come from between burgers all over the floor because the garbage container was overfilled. This garbage can was right up against what looked like a food keeper. Yuck. Over an hour and nothing cleaned up. The bathroom not too clean either! Clean up it up Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
20,Peggy R.,"New Egypt, New Egypt, NJ",32,5,4.0,5.0,2017-11-07,"We had the best experience at the Red Robin, so I wanted to take the time to let everyone know how amazing a place this is.  We received delicious food, great drinks, and outstanding service.  Then, on top of all that, I lost an item of great value there, and they found it and kept it, hoping I would realize it was gone and call!  I noticed the next day, called, and they were so happy they had found it, and pleased to return it to me.  The workers there are so incredibly honest.  Had the same thing happened somewhere else, the outcome may have been much different.  You can be assured we will be going there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
25,Rebecca C.,"Clifton, NJ",25,65,77.0,3.0,2017-11-28,The burgers are great as well as the tower of onion rings with ranch dressing. Service is a disaster. Make sure you allow yourself to be sober or get drunk before hand because it takes forever for refills. Allow at least 3 hours for lunch or dinner. That's how bad the service is. Management really needs to re-train these servers!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
21,Dave B.,"Trenton, NJ",23,18,14.0,3.0,2017-12-23,"It's fast casual dining. My biggest gripe with this place is the prices for their food. $11.50 for chicken strips and fries. That's a lot for a place like this. $2.99 for an iced tea. That's a little high as well. I want to like this place more, but it really seems like their corporate management is trying to squeeze some extra pennies out of folks who, if they dine at RR-type places regularly, probably could use that money elsewhere.  tl;dr: Pricey, average quality food. You get what you pay for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
27,Pasquale D.,"Hightstown, NJ",0,38,,3.0,2017-12-24,This chain is run well the service and people are always good. The food can sometimes be spotty. I know this is just a burger place but some days the burgers are cooked well with fresh ingredients and sometimes its like getting a fancy burger king. The appetizers are good our favorite is the mozzarella sticks when these are hot truly best around.  I will agree the menu can be a bit  pricey but its more of a sit down place so you aren't getting for less anywhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
24,N S.,"trenton, NJ",0,4,,5.0,2017-12-30,"This Red Robin is great. They have many great deals like 20% off and military discounts. And the burgers are very juicy and cheesy (which I love). Also, the bottomless fries are great if I'm hungry and done with my entrée. To finish my review, they have many great options for children like mac & cheese, pasta, and pizza. They also have great options for adults.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
