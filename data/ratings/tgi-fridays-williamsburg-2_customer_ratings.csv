Food was on point, nothing was dried or bitter, I had the lobster and salmona fish for dinner, it was pretty good overall but in a way the price seem a tab bit high just for a couple pieces of lobester and a small portion of fish for 17.99. Luckily we were there for happy hour so Had drinks specials and the apptz were 1/2 during that time. Great place, prolly be back in the area when I go visit my friend.

My brother sat with an empty water cup for his entire meal (he ate hot wings for lunch). My sister finished her drink as well (Dr. Pepper) and at the end of her meal it was refilled with Sprite. My aunt was given the wrong salad, given a new one that was wrong as well. The menu advertised a half an avocado in her salad and she found a little circle of avocado in it. We ordered the endless apps of boneless wings and got our meals right away, but my aunt and mom took an extra 20 minutes to get their meals of A BURGER and a SALAD.
