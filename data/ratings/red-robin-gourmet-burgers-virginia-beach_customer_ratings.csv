While they are known for their burgers (which I've only had 1 bad experience...rye bread absolutely sucks with a burger...

GET THE FLOAT!  Maybe I just don't eat a lot of ice cream with my root beer, but GET THE FLOAT!  You won't be sorry.  In fact, you won't be disappointed with anything on the menu (except the rye bread...nasty)!   And I dare you to walk in there and yell ""RED ROBIN...YUMMM!!!""  Just let me know when you are gonna do it so I'm there to record it.  I triple dog dare ya!

So. from that experience on, I haven't had any problems here.  The food is cooked properly, and the servers are very attentive to your needs, even when it's busy.  The only exception is if you are in the bar area and it's busy sometimes; they may not be as attentive, but the food has never been an issue. There are a couple of normal items that I get here.  I'll usually get the tavern burger or the California chicken sandwich.  Both of these items have been very good.  The burgers have not been over or under cooked, and they will give you bottomless fries if you are into that.

Our waitress only came to the table to take our drink order, our food order and to bring our food. I have never waited to long for food in a restaurant in my life. I have waited tables, so I'm generally pretty understanding of being busy, BUT if food is taking a long time to come out, a waitress should take care of her customers the ways she can. At least come and check to see if anyone needs drink refills! The manager was also no where to be found.

And everyone knows how important that is with kids. I usually get the grilled chicken salad with the focaccia bread, and it is soooo good, but the burgers, clucks, and sandwiches are super yummy too. Also, our family LOVES fries so the bottomless fries they offer are a huge hit for us. And the mountain high mud pie, is to die for.

When I got there we waited for a hostess to come up to seat us and it took about 3 mins for anyone to come. There wasn't a wait to get seated by a crowed or anything there was just lack of service. Then it didn't stop there our waitress wasn't around to fill our drinks or ask us if we'd like anymore salad or fries since it's bottomless. She wasn't even the one to give us our food. Another server did and when I asked her are the blk beans on the side she didn't know anything about it so the communication amongst the staff isn't good. If our waitress just served us instead of missing in action it would of been avoided with the confusion of my order. Then my friend and I have been done waiting for our check for about 10mins and she still hasn't come around to check on us so we had to go up to her when we saw her behind the bad to ask for our bill.

My work is located near Red Mill and coming here is not only convenient, I've come here enough times to know this place has never failed me once. There's always great vibes from the employees and booths everywhere puts my body at ease. The music isn't half bad either.

The one that reminds me that there's is still good burgers out there.  Bleu Ribbon: got this because I was in the mood for bleu cheese & their crispy onion straws. I added an egg to this and it was everything I could ask for.  ***Ask for their classic sauces: they are free of charge! -My fave was the Campfire (creamy BBQ) -Secret tavern tasted like a tangy creamy sauce  -Sweet n Spicy Ketchup was good too -Honey Mustard was different from what I've had other places. It's more of a neon yellow with black pepper in it, and it has subtle on the mustardiness to it, complimented by a sweet kiss of honey. I'm getting this everytime.

I approached the manager, Carlos, about the issues with our meal.  He basically shrugged and said that they were having ""lots of problems.""   My suggestion?  Maybe the District Manager should remedy these ""lots of problems"" or close the doors before anyone else spends their hard earned money on a disgusting meal in a filthy restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.5000000000000004,3.3600000000000003

35,Xavier C.,"Chesapeake, VA",228,182,37.0,1.0,2015-02-17,"Well, this proves it to me that each of these places really does have its own entity.  Went here after the Polar Plunge and was beyond disappointed.  The only thing I think they got right was the fact that they looked like the other Red Robins' in the area. First the seating.  When they attempted to sit us down, the table wasn't even clean.  A busboy walked by and noticed they gave us the bench seat and went ""whoa"".. and then cleaned our area.   Upon sitting down our waitress did the usual (drinks, appetizers) and there were 5 of us in total - two kids and 3 adults.  We all placed our orders and here is where the chaos started to happen.   Since I've come to accept the fact that Red Robin no longer gives you fries before the meal, I asked for an extra set to come w/ the meal (didn't come btw).  The boys ordered a freckle drink and when they drank through it, she gave them the wrong refill (more on this in a bit).  Boys, being boys, they went ahead and drank it thinking that was the refill anyway.  Pressing forward the food came and was just not up to par of what I've come to expect from the better RR's.  The fries had sat around awhile, the burgers were ""meh"" and it took FOREVER to get extra fries.  The best part - when we DID get fries, you could actually count 10 fries.  Ten would be rather gracious considering some of them were less than 1"" long.  It made me wonder if this was their new quantity control thing going on. Aside from the food be ""meh"", refills were distant, and to top it off, they got my check wrong.  Remember that wrong refill?  They added that drink onto my check and the boys drink on our friends check (basically charged us twice).  All of this btw - was done by EVERYONE else BUT our server.  Isn't that crazy?  She came to us so infrequently, we had to get the other servers to tell someone to give us a refill, get the manager to give us fries, then a different manager corrected our check.   This visit was a joke of a Red Robin.  The best part?  While the waitress was prudent enough to ask me for my Red Robin card information - she failed to put it as a part of my tab so I never received the credit for my order.  Classy.

We mainly came for the bottomless fries, but after we got our order our waitress failed to come in and check on us to make sure we were ok and wanted more fries and another milkshake.

26,Kristen P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",336,245,213.0,1.0,2015-06-29,"(Side note: I am 3miles from a RR near my home but that restaurant had gone downhill despite repeated attempts to redeem themselves I had to drive here. This restaurant is 13 miles from my home which is a BIG deal when driving an extra 10 miles each way for hopefully better food/service.) **It is with great sadness that I have to write this review. I gave a different RR in another city a try and when it just didn't work out I that's when I drove out to the county. My 12 year old was immediately pleased with this place as soon as we walked up the sidewalk. When we stepped in, the roar of the guests and the hustle of the servers were a change of pace from the RR we were use to. After a moment we were seated pleasantly by Renee the manager. She was glowing pregnant and prideful of her baby bump :-) She was the sweetest and most professional  woman I had run across all day so far. Josh sat us, he was amazing! He was funny, personable and sat is with pose and professionalism. He listened to me and waited for my party to be seated before placing the menus down. So crazy lady, why the 1 star review if everything was so great? Well, I'm so glad you asked!! My 4 children and I specifically came to RR after my long day at work. We were celebrating my first day at work AND a couple twin girls 10th birthday but guess what? There wasn't any celebrating! The kids wanted endless Mac and cheese and I was exhausted so I was happy to oblige. Well, after all 4 kids happily placed their Mac and Cheese order the waitress told them ""did you know we changed our menu and your Mac and cheese is no longer bottomless? But the quality is better and you'll get bigger portions and better quality."" That was SO disappointing but we stayed bc the waitress said ""bigger portions, better quality, spiral noodles...etc"" Mac and Cheese came to the table...you guessed it, same old dish as before, no new ingredients but this time it's in a square bowl....oohhhh weeee! This was not new, not improved, not bigger, not better and I asked to speak to a manger. Here comes Renee. She pretty much said ""there is no way I can give you anymore Mac and cheese. I can't even ring it up, my hands are tied (and in a snotty tone) she said ""what do you want me to do? I can't do anything for you!""  OMG I'd rather have been talking to the floor because she was 1. Not nice 2. Not accommodating 3. Rude!  I never asked Renee for more Mac and cheese, I just asked ""why am I paying the same price for the same quality but told it's better quality and not being allowed endless?"" I made sure to say ""I'm not mad at you I'm just frustrated because I didn't sleep last night in preparation for my first day at work, I'm tired, and when we leave here I will have to go home and make food for the kids because this is not how I planned my celebration dinner."" And I'm not going to lie, I cried because I'm a tired frustrated baby getting now where at this crappy place. She replied ""didn't the server tell you in the beginning that the Mac and cheese wasn't endless?"" I said ""that's not the point! You're not listening! It was after the kids ordered happily and we're excited, what was I suppose to do, say ""no thanks come on kids even though I'm exhausted and the server promised it was better quality we should leave?"" Renee replied in a rude manner ""I am not going to do anything for you."" I said ""can I have my Check please?"" She said ""sure"" and walked away. I never got my check. My server came back to the table 7 minutes later and said ""fry refills?"" And placed the fries on the table"" OMG my frustration was building!! Renee comes back to my table about 10 mins later with 4 bowls of Mac and cheese and said ""this is it. Don't ask for anything else. I am going to make a note on your account about this."" I said ""I DIDNT ASK YOU FOR THIS! I just wanted you to listen to me."" She said ""you have this now, is there anything else I can do for you?"" OF COURSE NOT RENEE YOUN HAVE BEEN RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS AND HELPED ME FEEL UNWELCOME IN THIS RESTAURANT. My server finally brought the check and I left.

Endless steak fries were refilled once and took longer than the original food. I ordered the special burger, a German burger, which sounded amazing. When it finally came, it was the smallest burger I had ever seen. I always get a burger when I come here, and I had never seen a burger this small. It did not even fill the bun.

Ashley the bartender wasn't very attentive to her customers at the bar whatsoever. Frankly she talked more and joked around with the server staff that were coming to the bar acting like little kids. She was tasting almost every drink she made and had a childish demeanor. A customer at the bar had to walk down the bar and get his own ketchup. After slamming it into the bar because of his frustrations, the bartender Ashley asked him if he was making a mess over there with no apology after he had told her that he had to go get his own ketchup. She stated that she was using wrong glassware for certain drinks and even had servers telling her how to make certain drinks. So unprofessional and personally unacceptable being in the restaurant industry. Hopefully I will never have to deal with her again.

The answer of course, was yes.  That's when the trouble started... I visited with a friend of mine that was combat wounded - in fact, he suggested we go.  I mention this because of what happened as we entered.  The host, a young man probably still in his teens, welcomed us and began showing us to a table.  My buddy has a cane and walks with extreme difficulty - we passed through the entire restaurant to the very back before being seated.  The problem was the amount of empty, obviously non-reserved tables we walked by before getting to ours.  My buddy's obvious impairment didn't factor in to our table selection.  Bad call host. We sat below arguably the world's coldest vent while we waited to order.  The waitress was pleasant and well-versed in the menu and recommendations.  Though the kitchen might not have been quite so versed as it took 23 minutes to make some chicken-tenders, fries, and a medium-rare burger.  They weren't busy or packed by any means so it seemed a bit slow.  Add the fact that my food was dropped on the floor and well, you can see the downward trend. Our meals were actually good when they finally came out.  The standard frozen and warmed tenders were decent with an almost spicy ""ghost pepper"" coating.  My buddy's burger looked tempting enough to steal it.  Our beers were almost as cold as the AC! So how to rate this place... It's an ok spot to dine (this was my first time, and I'll go back to try again).  The front of house staff needs some ""accessibility training"" and some ""how-to-warn-people-about-cold-air training"".  The kitchen may want to prioritize their cooking procedures a bit as well.  The 3-Stars are based mainly on those two things.  The food was standard-to-great and the atmosphere was what you'd expect from a family/community centric pseudo sports-bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.572,2.56

Ever since I joined the Red Robin Royalty Rewards, I have been irrationally excited to get my free birthday burger. My husband and I went up tonight to get a couple of burgers, including my free one. I have never ordered a well done burger at this location, but I had to tonight. It was just their gourmet cheeseburger, well done. When I received the burger, I cut it in half and there was pink everywhere; it was definitely not well done. I showed the waitress, who was very apologetic, and she told me she would have the kitchen make a new one. After quite a long wait (which would have been fine if the burger was cooked properly), the manager brought me my burger. It was cut in half to show that the inside was done, so I thanked him and began to eat it. When I cut the burger into smaller pieces, though, I saw that the inside was still pink. I was shocked! When the waitress returned, I told her that the burger still wasn't well done, and that we would like to leave. She told us that she would have the manager take the burger off our bill, which she did. As my husband and I were leaving, the manager came over to let us know that he had taken the burger off of our bill and that ""it looked done when he cut it in half."" I agreed with him but told him that the rest of the inside was still pink. Red Robin is a burger restaurant and one that sells to a lot of children on a regular basis. I find it very unnerving to realize that the kitchen at this particular restaurant doesn't know how to cook burgers to specific temperatures. Ground beef has a higher risk than other meat (like steak) of being infected with e.coli and other bacteria. Any restaurant, but especially a burger-centric restaurant that caters to families, should be MUCH better about training their cooks to properly prepare food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.248,2.6

Her advice turned out to be pretty solid although I was not as excited about the ""new"" mac & cheese recipe as she was. Great: The chicken ""burger"" that I enjoyed was messy perfection! Sweet heat! Practically divine. Relish & honey down my chin. Red Robin you did good! ""The Bees Knees Burger"" is only available for a limited time. I think it will be gone by Thanksgiving so I'm very happy that I got a chance to try it. Not so great: Single Bathroom dispenser out of soap. Needs to be refilled. The lady after me looked confused. We both remarked about needing clean hands before we started our meals. Thankfully we both got a little half squirt of soap. Over an hour later I went back to the restroom before leaving. Still no hand soap. This little girl was there shaking the hand soap dispenser turning it upside down struggling trying to get a little piece of soap out, she looked defeated. So on my way out I found a manager and I let her know that the ladies room was out of hand soap and she said ""Thank you I will take care of that immediately!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.416,2.72

We have always loved Red Robin and can normally have a nice family dinner without any issues, tonight Red Robin was dead set on ensuring that wasn't the case. Before we even decided what we wanted to eat we noticed the dishes were a dirty, not scratched, dirty. The dishes had old food stuck on them, whatever I'm not a complainer, but I do have standards. I brought this to our servers attention (a cranky woman by the name of Teresa) and she stated that all the silverware would be in the same condition, when I pointed out the food on it she said okay she'll get some more but to just leave that there for now. Okay, cool. We went on having a conversation and placed our orders, among them the towering onion rings. We saw our waitress bring the onion rings to another table, and then after they said no that's not ours she brought them back to the kitchen and carried on. We flagged her down and she told us to wait, and brushed us off. When she came back we confronted her about the onion rings, the silverware that was still sitting on the edge of the table, and her attitude and requested to speak to the manager. A few minutes passed and another waitress came over and said that she would be our server for the remainder of the night. So we told her about the onion rings, the silverware, and that we would still like to speak to the manager. She said okay, and carried on with whatever she was doing before, not addressing any of our concerns. The manager (Jeff) finally came over and asked what the issues were, we told him our quarrels and his response was ""well you got your food now, what else can I do for you?"". We literally just told him. We. Just. Told. Him. He was clearly not listening to a word we said and when we told him AGAIN after that that we wanted silverware, our onion rings, and an apology. We all got up and left our food as is (I was the only one that had a small bite because, guess what, we still had no silverware) and proceeded to walk out of the establishment when my father asked the manager for the store number and to contact his boss. These people were not concerned with customer service or satisfaction. My father kindly tried to tell Jeff what really set us over the edge, and he told him it was his comment that discredited everything we said and made us feel like they didn't care at all. Only gets one star because I have to. Piss poor service, mediocre food. Will never go here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

So we haven't had a good burger in awhile so the hubs suggested that we head here for dinner. A friend of mine always raves about how good the food is so I was pretty stoked.  We were seated in a cramped little table next to a wall. The service was fine. They got our drinks fast and came to order pretty quickly.  I decided to order the bacon cheeseburger. The food came out on a red platter. Kind of reminded me of food that you got in a cafeteria. The fries were bottomless which ment you could eat as much as you wanted. They were pretty good fries. Nice and hot. Let's move on to the burger though. It was so blah.. The patty didn't taste seasoned. It needed to be seasoned. Lol. It was so bland and dry. I let my hubby eat half of my burger and he agreed that was not good.    Next time I'll try their chicken sandwich.

He ended up being the one to sweep, but he did a half-done job. Are you serious? Then, our waitress who serviced us only offered the ""bottomless"" fries once we were two bites away from finishing our meal.

I ordered the California Chicken sandwich and it was SO. DANG. GOOD! it was juicy, the bacon the cooked right, the toppings were fresh and those fries...I had no idea they were endless but I could have eaten them all day!  They use the tablets at the table to let you reorder drinks, pay your check and to play games but sometimes it's better to be face to face with your server when you need something.

I've never, in the many years I've been coming to Red Robin, had a Freckled Lemonade taste so bad and so off. It's one of the things I look forward to when I eat at RR. So when I ask to have my first glass exchanged for a better one because it tasted flat and watered down, I expect to get a banging glass of some Freckled lemonade! But when you get the new one and it tastes exactly the same as the first, I turn into an irritated little bunny. I was not a happy camper and didn't even want to ask for another one so I sucked it up and sipped it ever so hesitantly.  Service was a little slow and it wasn't even busy. I have one gift card here that i need to burn but after that, I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon. There's just way too many other options in the area, which is a shame because once upon a time, I loved Red Robin and would drive further than I really should for their food. But, the continuous strong smell of dirty wash rags in the air was a complete turn off, for one. Sticky, wobbly tables made eating feel like a juggling act in a circus. And of course, the tip of the iceberg was bad Freckled Lemonade twice. Tsk Tsk",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

Daughter name-dropped Red Robin prior to dinnertime, so we obliged.  Walked in and there was a certain smell in the air...kinda like dirty mop water. Ignorable since the smell didn't follow us as my family was led to the seating area in the back of the restaurant. However, makes me a little wary given 1. my fam is there to eat and 2. the kitchen is nearby the hostess stand and clearly along the path of the lingering smell. Just makes you wonder.  Fairly slow Thursday evening.  Server was friendly. Daughters asked for an extra tabletop game system, so they each could have their own to play on as we waited, and our waitress happily provided another (as always done during our previous visits). Food arrived rather quickly. Enjoyed my gourmet burger and fries, and husband ate up his Tavern Burger. Daughters found the mozzarella sticks appetizer tasty and seemed to enjoy their meals just the same. No complaints on the corn nuggets and kids burger. Children just wished that when they asked for a refill that they received the same original beverage.  2 out of 3 stalls in the women's restroom were functional. 1 out of 3 sinks in the ladies restroom was not either a) clogged with paper towels or b) filled with bubbly water that wouldn't seem to drain.  One surprise came when we received the bill. Apparently, since the last time we ate at Red Robin, there's a $1.99 entertainment fee for the extra tabletop game unit request. Ummmm...okay then. Good to know for next time. Maybe I should have let my children play while eating their meal?.? Wish we were told about that fee ahead of time. Or maybe I wish that we held off on our prompt bill payment cause the game units shut off immediately afterwards.
