Judy J.,"Saint Charles, MO",7,25,63,3.0,11/17/2017,"This was my first time at this location. Stopped with a friend to have appetizers and drinks. We had potato skins and the spinach queso dip. Everything tasted good but was just typical bar food. We tried a couple of the specialty drinks, Barbados rum punch and Long Island tea, pricey but good.  Since we sat in the bar area, the bartender was our server. It was a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't bother us. If you're on a time schedule, probably not the best place to sit.  All things considered, it was ok, but wouldn't rush back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur
Matt S.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,4,,1.0,10/20/2017,"This is our second time going to this location in the last 3 months and both times have been simply horrible and included with all of the usual cliches. Multiple wait staff walking past us working with other tables, same waitstaff hanging out, worst of all was the wait.  3 months ago we gave them the benefit of the doubt and ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes before we were actually approached/had orders taken. This time around we gave them 10 minutes as yet again staff walked past us constantly with/without food and casually chilling out at the closest waiter's station(20 feet away) tl;dr save yourself the headache and go to the Applebee's on the other side of 270",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur

We alerted management and our waiters multiple times and they said they turned it off after our first request (and they may have) but the very cold air was still blowing. Even the men were miserable the whole dinner when it's usually just us girls saying we are cold. :) So that pretty much ruined it for all of us and it's what we remember about it: being miserably cold with goosebumps the whole dinner. :/ Service was pretty good, but that was about it.

Janay B.,"Springfield, IL",0,4,,1.0,7/23/2017,Horrible customer service. The manager Steve was extremely unprofessional and rude when I called to place a to-go order. I've been spending almost $100 a week at this restaurant for the past 2 years and they were acting like it was going to kill them to take one more order from a loyal customer 5 mins before the kitchen closed. All the money I've spent at this location and they treat me this way. Steve  the manager was making it seem like he was doing me a favor. Ummmmm. It's ME who is spending the money. You guys can't pay your bills without customers like ME spending their money at your establishment every week. They need to have customer service training. And Their servers walk around on their phones listening to music all night. I'll take my money somewhere else. Do NOT go to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur

Sandy K.,"Chesterfield, MO",3,3,,1.0,12/4/2017,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years. My 7 y.o. daughter wanted to go to someplace new (to her) and so we went there for a girls dinner after church. It was so disappointing! I ordered a grilled chicken Cesar salad  because I remembered that they were so good there. It was the most generic salad with a very small amount of something that was supposed to be chicken on top. I don't know what happened to the chicken. It was spongy and nasty. The portion was very small too. I was still hungry after eating it. My daughter had the mac and cheese. She said it was good but again it was a very small amount -- even for a kid's size. Since we were still hungry, we took the recommendation of the server and enrolled in the rewards program so we could get a free dessert. We ordered one of their holiday shakes. It looks great in the picture but it was NOT good. I can't see how you can mess up ice cream but it didn't taste like anything had had big chunks of ice in it. It is also impossible to eat without getting covered in goo. I will say the server was very nice and our food came quickly but I won't be coming back anytime soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur

Janky D.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,37,41,3.0,3/12/2017,"First off let me say I was twisted on whether or not I should write this considering how nice our waitress and the manager was. I only gave 3 stars because of the little girl that was SUPPOSED to seat us.  We always come to this location and the waitresses are ALWAYS NICE!!!  MANAGER NICE!!!  Even the ones that just walk by our table are nice. Anywho this particular evening we decided to come here and have dinner and after being told the wait would be 10 minutes we sat down and waited. 5 minutes later these three guys come in and one of them ask us how long the wait for us would be, we tell him 5~10 minutes and this punk b*tch turns his nose up at us after answering his oodles of noodles looking ass and continues to talk to Phineas and Ferb (the other 2 funny looking f*ckers he was with). I'm guessing because we were two lesbians he felt his manhood was going to shrink.  Anyway, the one guy starts talking to the young girl that's taking people's names for seating. I overheard him asking her where he knew her from and she started saying who she was related to. Before we know it, this Lil bubble head ass girl picks up 3 menus and goes and seats these three apple head mfkrs before us.  So we're like W.T.F..LIKE HOLD UP.. WHERE THEY DO THAT SH*T AT?!?!? I'm guessing HERE!! As she comes back she can't even look us in the eyes because she knowssss she was dead wrong. So we're about to blow an immediate fuse until the manager asks what happened and we told him. He seated us quickly and apologized about the situation and he even offered to take  20% off of the bill.  So we're like alright.. Cool. In the mist of all of this he asked the the girl why she seated them before us and her response was that we were waiting on a booth, funny thing is we didn't even have that conversation about where we wanted to sit. Anyway, I'm continuing to eat my favorite sizzling chicken and cheese dinner, low and mfkn behold there is a GOSHDAMN LONG BLACK ASS HAIR IN MY FOOD!!!!! I know sh*t happens,  but DAYUMMMMMMMMM really!!! So we call for the manager AGAIN and he comes over and he's like damn and shakes his head and tells us he'll handle the the full bill.  We appreciate it, but that hair made me feel some type of way because I was halfway through my dinner.  Has me thinking did I swallow anything that wasn't apart of my meal. Anyway waitresses great, manger great!! The lil f*cktard chick at the door has alot to learn,  whoever in the back cooking with loose hairs floating around please control your hair cousin it,  sheesh. As we're leaving out,  the little pumpkin head *ss girl who started this bad experience made sure she didn't even look our way.  As everybody knows when you are leaving the restaurant, who's ever at the door always says have a good evening or something like that. She didn't even acknowledge us, back in the day I would've cursed her lil dumb*ss out and made a scene, but now I just let my fingers do the talking for me on yelp. Anyway, I guess this wasn't a good experience for myself or T. G. I,  smh. I just want to say,  I'm not holding any of this against the waitresses or the manager because some things are just out of their control. Will we come back to this location? Maybe not,  from this experience I don't even wanna dine out anymore. My stomach won't let me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur

Jess P.,"Saint Louis, MO",271,105,654,1.0,3/13/2016,"Sunday March 13, 2016  (10pm) So let me tell you guys about my horrible experience, I had at TGI Fridays, on this Sunday night. I just wanna say, I have never felt so unwanted as a customer, in my life, than i have felt tonight by the staff of the TGI Fridays at this location. So I've been craving the Sizzling Chicken an Cheese plate, been thinking about it all day, just knew i was going there, and having this for dinner. So we arrived at 10pm, it says their open till midnight. The hostess at the door, tells us that the dining area is closed, and we can sit at the bar. she wasn't very friendly or informative, nor did she guide us, or give us menus. So we sit at the bar for about 5 minutes and steal a menu from the other end of the bar.  The bartender, Chelsea,  approaches us, and she informs us that the kitchen had just closed, and we won't be able to place a food order. We were bummed and stated that we weren't here for the drinks, we specifically came here to eat, so we start to grab our keys and leave. She stops us, and says ""Well wait, let me check with the kitchen, maybe we can still squeeze your order in"" So she comes back, and gives us the green light. we place our order, she puts it in. After about five minutes after that. I see her again, and ask for a soda, and his drink. So we sit there for about 30 minutes, then she goes and checks on it, and comes back with a bag of To-Go food. Like my jaw dropped. just utter dissapointment, She states well i didn't know you wanted it for here. I clearly stated i was her to eat.  Like are you serious? did I ask for a to go order? How could you assume something like that? That could've easily been cleared up with a question, if you had any thought on it. Like I ordered a Sizzling dish, the point is to have it brought to me sizzling on a cast iron plate. The meal looked so un appealing in the to-go container, there was pretty much no cheese in the dish, and what they did have in there was burnt to a cheese crisp that was at the bottom of the container. The mashed potatoes was just blah, absolutely no flavor, and tasted like they were instant mashed potatoes.   Not only did the food lack, i ate my dish at the bar with plastic utensils, out of the plastic containers. The bartender had no interest in taking the food back and properly plating it and serving it to us, once she found out that she had  made a mistake. She simply drops off 2 small side plates and some silverware. Like we're supposed to  take the food out of the containers and re-plate it, if we wish to eat here. My boyfriend was entirely pissed off, he didn't even try to eat his food, he simply took the togo container and stuck it in the togo bag, and waited on me to finish my meal. Honestly whats the point of saying your open till midnight, if your going to start closing 2 hours before that, and be busy doing closing jobs, that distract you from providing full service to the remaining guest that are trying to enjoy the establishment. So that was how i spent my Sunday night, getting treated like shit at TGI Fridays. All i wanted was some good service and some good food. Its clear that neither of those can be found at this location of TGI Fridays. Im sad to say this experience was so bad that i don't think i will ever return to any Fridays location, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur

Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635,1.0,10/19/2016,"I didn't walk in with high expectations but really I had one of the worst dining experiences I can remember here tonight. We had a party of 5 and they sat us as far back in the restaurant as possible. 2 of us arrived first and told the hostess we were expecting 3 other women. Ten minutes later we found two of the other women sitting at another table. Good job hostess! The server has a problem getting our drinks out because that took about 15 minutes. 5 waters, 1 club soda, and 1 vodka. We order. One person at the table asked if the spinach side dish has dairy because she doesn't eat it. The waitress has no clue. 3 out of 5 meals come out and she delivers them and looks at our dairy free friend and tells her the spinach has cheese would she like something else? I apologized but said I was going to start eating because if she's delivering our food but taking her side dish order it's going to be a while and mine would be cold. I ordered a small portion of chicken strips and fries. It was all cold anyway and undercooked. Another 10 minutes elapse and the remaining 2 members receive their meals after 3 of us had been eating. We ask for mustard (she says they don't have brown mustard only yellow), bbq sauce, and napkins. That's another 8-10 minutes. She brings the check and 1 to go box. The bill was roughly $48. I handed her a $100 bill. During the eternity we waited for change a man who was presumably some sort of manager stopped at the table and asked how we were all doing. I mentioned that we were great but we had been waiting for change for quite a while. He said yeah, someone handed us a $100 bill and we've been breaking it. Like that takes multiple people and lots o time? It takes another 12-15 minutes for her to come back with the change. Food was horrible and service was worse.

The chicken & shrimp were cooked perfectly, the blackening seasoning wasn't overwhelming, BUT they over did it on the sauce which made for a ""pasty"" consistency. Oh, and I got 2 slivers of red bell pepper on it. On a brighter note, my husband ordered the sizzling chicken & cheese skillet & he had no complaints, he said it was really good & the chicken was tender & well marinated. Our service was moderate.

Lunch on a Wednesday just before noon, not yet busy.  We ordered four lunch deals and none of them scored even acceptable.  Both orders of ""Jack Sliders"" we're over overcooked and dry, on dry stale buns, with a hint of onion and nothing we could identify as JD glaze or whatever they were supposed to have.  Fries could scarcely deserved their name as the were undercooked, limp and cold.  Chicken sliders were clumsily assembled, boring and dry.  Mac & cheese with some kind of sausage was small and pretty much tasteless.  I didn't hear anyone complain about the fried mozzarella, but it would be hard to mess that up.

Cindy A.,"Wildwood, Saint Louis, MO",6,15,20,1.0,3/13/2016,"I thought I would calm down before I wrote this review because it breaks my heart.  I worked at Friday's in the 1980s.  It was a hard and rewarding job and I learned a lot about multi tasking, pace, team work, etc.  Now I am retired and don't get to eat what I want or go out to eat everyday.  I was really looking forward to a real hamburger and fries!  Maybe even dessert when we decided to go to Fridays.  It was so disappointing. The place was not clean.  The floor was slippery under my shoes and felt greasy.  Little bits of trash littered the station where we sat.  One family actually asked to sit elsewhere.  We ordered jack Daniels burgers.  They were dry and tasteless.  We weren't sure if they forgot the sauce or not.  There was a bullet on the side so we dipped or food in it.  I don't get to eat a lot of hamburgers.  When I do, it has to be a good one.  This was not.  It is not a cheap burger.  If you charge a premium price the product should be premium too.    Now for the service, this was ridiculous.  The poor hostess ran her ass off while the wait staff stood around the bus stations, leaning on them and hanging out.  I never saw my waiter after he dropped off the food.  Later we had to flag down another waitress and ask for napkins.  She brought us cocktail napkins and said ""here ya go!""  Finally we see our waiter who dropped the check off.  He never asked us if our food was ok or if we wanted to have dessert. We were looking forward to dessert since we walked in.  This waiter never once smiled or made sure our experience was good.  So today I can tell you I ate an expensive lunch at a dirty restaurant where people obviously didn't want to do their job of ensuring the guest had a good experience.     Now, I ask to speak to the manager.  I told him everything.  He apologized for everything with a speech that I am positive he has used several times.  He was a terrible example of a leader.  I told him how we had looked forward to dessert.  He never asked if we still wanted any!!!  So no dessert for us.      Friday's used to be fun, high energy with good food and great service.  It is gone.  Left is a dirty remnant of what it used to be.  After over 30 years of going to this restaurant, I can honestly say we will never go back.  I don't recommend you go there either.  This was not a one off, it is top down terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=20

Vince L.,"Ballwin, MO",70,246,648,2.0,5/19/2014,"We had not planned on dining here but a place nearby.  The original place had a 90+ minute wait.  This place had more or less none.  Should have been our first sign. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  There were plenty of open booths, apparently they were not staffed for the day.  Who would have thought a lot of folks want to go eat out on Mother's Day? Once we got seated it took a bit to get waited on.  Then another wait.  Maybe another 20 minutes or longer to get food.  Now, I can understand when the restaurant was slammed there would be a delay but this place was barely 50% capacity. When the food came out it came out in pieces, meaning we each got served separately.  So my wife ate and almost finished hers when my daughters food came out, then she was nearly complete, then mine came out.  The food was OK.  Nothing to brag about or HAVE to go back for. In fact, due to the speed of the seating, service, and food delivery I doubt we will head back.  This chain used to be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=20

I am always excited to come to Fridays after seeing an aggressive advertising  campaign. Now this location  is not cooperate so the expirience  is not cooperate par. I alway recall seeing napkins strewn about  and crayon bits on the floor. This TGIF expirience  would not be complete, without the poor service,  long waits for cold, overcooked food, and a mystery stains on the seats.  And when we brought up the charred not medium-rare burger, I was told  there was a manager on duty....but I wouldn't  have known this becuase he had better things to do then tend to the customers.

Kelly S.,"Bothell, WA",239,88,10,1.0,8/13/2014,"I think we can all agree that Friday's across the country have seen better days. This used to be IMHO the best nationwide causal full service chain, superior to Chili's and miles above Applebee's. But what isn't?  But this review is specifically for this train wreck of a location. So yeah... Five of us walk in the restaurant about 45 min to close for a quick bite after a long day. We were led to a dark corner, cued non verbally by the hostess to step over a dirty, wet mop on the way. That mop remained laying on its side on the floor for the full 90 minutes that we ate our ""food"". But I'm getting ahead of myself. So we sit... Ten minutes go by with no server. The server shows and can't answer the basic questions and proceeds to forget half the drink orders upon the second visit another ten minutes later. We wonder where she is as we're tucked away in a dark corner. On around the third trip we remind her that we'd actually like to eat and haven't placed an order. She smells more and more like cigarette smoke on each visit. Some bottomless appetizers finally arrive at some point. Orders are placed with great frustration as the server is too high or drunk to comprehend (not kidding). Now the food. Oh the food. We order these new sample plates they're promoting. The second round of the bottomless apps arrives and looks entirely different than the first. I mean, two separate appetizer dishes both looked so completely different than their predecessors that we wondered how it was even possible.  I don't want to go too far into detail about the food but let's just leave it at ""a few things were halfway edible"". I could be here all day explaining the awfulness of the cold, dry, tasteless food we received across the board.  Most of us Yelpers have had this kind of bad night at a restaurant before, when absolutely nothing goes right. So were we one bit surprised that our under-the-influence server overcharged several items on the bill and took another 10-15 min to resolve? Not even a little bit.  I would give most restaurants the benefit of the doubt between a terrible server and an off night in the kitchen, but there was even a manager on duty who was about as useful as the wet mop on the floor. He did not talk to us and I think helped carry two plates of food at one point. There were no other customers occupying his time either.   All in all: this Friday's must require not giving a damn as a prerequisite for hire.

Instead it literally tasted like watered down kool aid (no lie) with 1/2 lemon squeezed in it and one raspberry that looked like it was ran over. The server tried my first one. He tasted it. He said it didn't taste right either.  The server said they had a new bar tender and didn't offer to refund me!  I didn't drink it and they charged me 8.59 for it. I won't be returning!

However, it's always hard for me to finish the meals. I always leave feeling completely disgusted.

On our last visit, we literally sat there for 30 minutes before ever having a waiter come get our drink orders. When our waiter did arrive, he was nice, but never apologized for the wait. And a few of our orders got screwed up.  Overall, TGI Friday's is decent, but I always seem to leave feeling slightly sick. My dad even got food poisoning once from their salad.

He brings the dr pepper within ten minutes. We sat there for 19 minutes before receiving our drinks! My mind was blown by this time. I'm a server myself and I know it should take no more than 10 minutes for the drinks.. At least bring waters if your bartender seems backed up. Anyways.. We place our order as soon as the drinks came. Our app should come out soon right? No. I order another mojito and jokingly ask Chris if it would take another 20 minutes and he surprised me and said... Yes!! I could not believe he just said that.. After 32 minutes.. Here comes our appetizer. (finally!) but wait.. Literally behind the appetizer was the rest of our meal! By now I was furious but I did not express my anger once. I told the manager about his comments and how long it took for everything. She immediately went and made me a new drink. Chris said ""it's obviously going to come out faster when a manager helps.""

Jacqueline C.,"Saint Louis, MO",219,313,349,3.0,3/23/2011,"Stopped in last night was thinking about how it has been forever since I enjoyed the sesame jack chicken strips.  I was seated in the bar area at a high top table. When the server finally came around I was disappointed to see she was going to be one of those - painful wish I was at home, don't want to wait on you - types. Sure enough I was correct. Her name, Michelle, was just unpleasant. She asked me what I'd like to drink, never mentioned the specials that the hostess kindly filled me in on. When my guest arrived she then looked at him and said ""do you want something to drink?"" --- wow! Someone has a case of the Monday's on Tuesday night.  After we ordered which I'll save you from the details of her rude behavior, the food arrived dropped of by another server. She was certainly more pleasant. After the food hit the table we began eating. Both of us drinking beer, it would have been nice for Michelle to inquire if we'd like another as we were half way through the glass, which means it's getting warm and no one enjoys luke warm beer. When she finally came around it was literally a walk-by and she said ""every thing ok"" before we could get the entire sentence out she had already passed out table.  Honestly, I left her a 10% tip on a $20 bill I am more of the 20-25% tipper. and some of those phenomenal servers earn the additional 5-10% higher.  Michelle was just awful.

Ashley A.,"Des Moines, IA",3,28,4,3.0,1/28/2011,"I actually said wow when I ate here.  So a vegetarian and a vegan walk into a TGI Friday's...and get delicious food! What...! Between us we had a few 4 and 5 dollar drinks (right now the ultimate margarita is $5). That was a great starter.  After that, fried green beans. Salt, fried stuff, and a seemingly healthier inside than a potato. So much better than french fries! They were really, really tasty.  And then came an even more pleasant surprise: the pasta. They have two angel hair pastas on the menu that have chicken, but we each got ours without chicken and with extra vegetables. The pasta was light, satisfying, and very good overall.  Ah, and the service was excellent. We had a very helpful waitress who split our check perfectly, got us boxes promptly, and--the best part--made sure there was no chicken in our food. That is something often overlooked at restaurants--it's not emphasized enough or something, because the majority of the time I still receive the meat even if I request it left out.

When deciding on a place for a larger number of people, I've found that T.G.I.Friday's is actually pretty good about making room. We had 12 people altogether, and we only waited about 10 to 15 minutes for them to make room and set us at a table.  I ordered a combo meal for $15.99. This might sound expensive for a meal at T.G.I.Friday's, but it was actually a really great ""Pick-Two"" deal from a menu they have. It gives you the choice of an appetizer and then an entree that they have selected for you. I ordered the half-order of loaded potato skins and the half-rack of ribs and shrimp.  It was definitely a hearty meal. I absolutely love their loaded baked potato skins. The cheese, bacon and the sour cream were perfect. As far as the entree goes, compared to a place like Pappy's, T.G.I.Friday's doesn't even come close, but for a chain restaurant that usually specializes in burgers, it wasn't bad at all. They have a Jack Daniel's sauce you can ask for that goes great with their ribs.

Stacy G.,"Maryville, IL",28,66,26,5.0,4/13/2011,"I eat here with my boss and coworkers at least once a week but often twice a week (my boss and his family are big fans) ... for nearly two years.  Jeff the waiter is awesome, ALWAYS ask for him! I love TGI Friday's and the food. My favorite dish is probably Chicken bruschetta pasta but I don't eat it very often because of the calories. I love their stripes program too. The only downside this location is the hostess. She has worked there as long as I have been dining here and she is just completely rude and unfriendly. How she keeps her job baffles me. I suppose because she is hot. The rest of our party eats there for dinner sometimes too yet when I arrive at lunch and look for them to see if they have a table, she never knows who I am or who they are. My dislike for this woman grows with each visit. How after two years do you honestly have NO IDEA who I am and who I sit with?  We have a regular rotation of restaurants we frequent in the area and at each of these other places the staff not only know all of us, they know what everyone in the group drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=60
S T.,"Saint Louis, MO",18,202,228,2.0,3/2/2011,"Went to Fridays with friends, and yet again.. medicore. Cold Jack Daniels chicken appetizer. Waitress was efficient but not friendly. The fridays shrimp was good, but the fries were over salty, cold and gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=60

Stephanie M.,"Tulsa, OK",89,31,12,3.0,7/28/2010,"I typically don't eat at chain restaurants when I'm on vacation, but I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't feeling well, so my hubby picked up our order to go. I got the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese, served with mashed potatoes. It was the perfect comfort dish: Cheesy chicken and mashed potatoes. My husband got the Sicilian Chicken sandwich & he said it was good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-creve-coeur?start=60
