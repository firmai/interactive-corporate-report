7,Rebecca R.,"Evansville, IN",4,3,2.0,4.0,2014-08-04,Great food always! Service is hit and miss but as long as your good sitting with a drink and not in a hurry then it's a great place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
5,Vikki H.,"Evansville, IN",0,6,9.0,2.0,2015-05-25,"Today was not good at all, BBQ chicken appetizer was warm to cool frozen old celery, burnt chicken and old Luke warm coffee festa chicken full of toughness",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
6,Dave S.,"Huntingburg, IN",1,17,,2.0,2015-11-03,"This place has gone down hill quite a bit over the past 4 or 5 years. Dined here last Saturday night (we had 3 adults), and for starters, the waiter got 2 of the orders wrong (he didn't write them down). The appetizer (wings) was served sans plates. We eventually got plates by hunting down the waiter and requesting them. My baby back ribs were so tough and overcooked that they were practically inedible. This was the second time I was served sub-par ribs here. Bad service can be forgiven, but bad food cannot. Seriously, the management here should dine at Cheddar's a few times and get schooled. I just might run into them there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
4,John G.,"Evansville, IN",9,12,,4.0,2016-02-14,Not bad today good timing with the service. Food was fantastic. I had the Fiesta lime chicken it was delicious and the sweet tea wasn't bad either the waitress was very professional and you can tell she knew what she was doing. I will go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
0,Lisa A.,"Evansville, IN",20,20,59.0,3.0,2016-05-22,"Not terrible, but never what you hope for! I'm sad to say I've given up on ordering steak here. Even with the new grills the meat is bland and overcooked. The honey chicken mac n cheese is always delicious though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
2,Beth W.,"Clarksville, TN",139,14,1.0,1.0,2017-01-11,"We were pretty disappointed with our experience tonight at Applebee's. The service was awful and the food was okay. Our server, Amari, was very very slow and you had to ask her multiple times for things and it seemed like our drinks were always empty. At our table we got the 2 for $20 with 2 side salads with honey mustard dressing, which was the highlight of the whole dinner and the cedar lemon chicken which was alright. The chicken was dry, the rice was bland, and the toppings on the chicken didn't have much flavor. We also had a pick 2 appetizer meal with the pub pretzels, which were very tasty, and boneless wings with sweet Asian sauce, which were very gristly. I would not get those again. Lastly, we had the oriental chicken salad, which was alright and had way to many noodles on it.  Then, when we were paying, we tried to use the machine at the table to pay and it was not working so we had to track down our waitress, which took another 12-15 minutes to do. We asked the hostess to get our waitress, after waiting 5 minutes and she couldn't find her. Then we had to ask the manager with hair the color of a stop sign to find our waitress and she wasn't much help either. Finally our waitress appeared and had to take the card to the back to get it to work.  Needless to say, we won't be going back to Applebee's any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
3,Ty H.,"New Braunfels, TX",40,5,1.0,1.0,2017-03-13,"Picked up order to go and I called the number on the Togo sign when I arrived. They said they'd be right out. 30 minutes later they came out and asked if I was picking up order and I said yes. The server said, ""well they didn't tell me"". When I got home, no chutney on the bone in pork chop. we asked for plain burger with the items on the side and it was all on the burger, and we ordered celery with our wings. That was missing also. MGR wanted to make it up to us, but I said no. this is the third time in a row we've had issues. We will most likely just choose to go somewhere else from now on. We don't have these issues at other Applebee's locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
1,Justin M.,"Menasha, WI",18,21,1.0,1.0,2017-08-16,"I called and placed an order for pick up. They told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. Upon arrival to the Pick up entrance, I waited for 5 minutes, as 8 different employees looked at me and walked past without any acknowledgement. Finally someone came out with my order.  One would think that when someone places an order To Go, the staff would supply you with eating utensils. After I got back to my Hotel room, I realized they hadn't supplied me with any utensils, so I had to get my own.  Food was good, but the service was horrible! The next time I am in town for work, I will not be going to this Applebees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-evansville-7,,,,,
