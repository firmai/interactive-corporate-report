Vlad V.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",189,679,188,3.0,12/26/2017,"I put TGI Fridays in the same boat as I do their main competitors in Chili's and Applebee's: it's alright but it's not real. Out of the three, I put Fridays in second place behind Chili's. There were several things I liked. They have drink specials every day of the week. Monday's specials included $3 mojitos, this I like very much. They also had $5 apps if you sat in the bar area. I did indeed sit in the bar area so I could watch some football and went with their appetizer platter. The platter came with four potato skins, sour cream, four mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce, and a good amount of BBQ boneless wings. None of the apps were great but they were all alright. Like I said, Fridays is alright but it's not real. Service was friendly. Like an idiot, I forgot my to-go box at the restaurant. Hooray.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",162,136,389,4.0,8/8/2017,I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in forever. This one is really quite nice. The main reason I am posting is I wanted to give props to Adam.

Alyssa H.,"Pearland, TX",53,3,1,1.0,8/7/2017,Wish I could leave zero stars. We waited at the door for 15 minutes and no one helped us so we just had a seat. It took over 30 minutes to get our drinks and order taken. We ordered lunch specials... salads and sliders. They took an hour and came out wrong.

Phillip was my server and he never asked if I needed anything. I asked too talk to a manger and she never came. I would not goo to this place.

Imman E.,"Katy, TX",140,182,296,3.0,8/21/2015,I came here for a late drink and endless apps. I say at the bar and the two bartender guys are usually friendly   and goofy. I have became a slight fan of TGIF. Idk if it's the endless apps or the fact they are open till 2 am or the every hour is happy hour. I will say  not on this visit but my previous 2 visits I was not so happy. 1 time was double charged for my meal and the other time shitty service from the Bartender. I had to hunt him down to pay for my meal. Should have dinned and dashed  because he was busy playing around in the back of the bar.  This visit wasn't as bad as the last two.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Stacy M.,"Fresno, TX",2,7,4,1.0,5/13/2017,"The worst service! Writing this review as we are still sitting here. Party of 6 came in at 2:00 in the afternoon. After being seated we waited 15 minutes, without being acknowledged, before we were able to flag someone down. When they told the server we were her table she made a face like she could care less. Ordered drinks and 2 appetizers. Appetizers show up before our drinks. They get dropped off in the middle of the table. No plates were given to us. Kids are starving and plates are not showing up so we finally just dig in. Nearly an hour after arrival and we still have not received food. All of our drink cups are empty and server is nowhere to be seen. Then, to top it off, they have an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Will not be back to this location.

Michelle D.,"Deer Park, TX",20,9,,1.0,2/3/2017,"I went there, haven't been there in quite a while. Sat down and ordered the double lunch, was excited, the chicken pasta and mozz sticks. .  Got the food, looked okay, began eating the pasta, and my mouth started burning and it tasted bad, found red bell peppers in it. I'm allergic to bell peppers and so my mouth is on fire, my face is going numb and my throat is burning.  I tell the guy I don't want it, instead of asking what was wrong, did I want a replacement of something else, did I want to speak to the manager, he said okay and took it away. I ate the cheese sticks and waited for him to come back and he didn't, so I had to chase him down to pay the bill.  Instead of discounting the portion of pasta, he said I had to pay it all whether or not I ate it. $13.00 dollars for four cheese sticks and a tea. .  He didn't ask if he could get a manager and see if it could be discounted, nothing. Sad, sad, poor customer service. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Joe C.,"Houston, TX",238,134,12,2.0,5/24/2017,"Service is mediocre. Food is well below average, while prices are just above average for this type of venue. Haven't been to a Fridays in 4 years. Likely 4+ more. Recommend Chili's if you need this type of fix. Spend a little more and go to BJ's, better all around. I'm not sure how Fridays has remained open. Alcohol maybe?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Danni V.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/25/2017,"FYI, my parents went to lunch there & my mother asked if they had senior/veteran discounts as my Father is a disabled vet. They don't have any discounts for Veterans. In case, you are a vet yourself or can appreciate their service for this country here's a quick reference of establishments who provide discounts to those men and women: These restaurants are glad to support veterans by providing discounted dining. Applebee's, IHOP, Longhorn Steakhouse, Outback, Texas Roadhouse, Golden Corral. Fast food chains as well Subway, Dairy Queen, Chick-fil-A, Quiznos.

DeAun A.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/20/2017,"This used to me and my sister's favorite place to eat! We'd go every Wednesday when they used to have trivia and a DJ. Ever since they renovated the place the quality of the food has gone waaaay down. Everything tastes like it was frozen. The last few times i went there my drinks were good but the service could've been better, But what sealed the deal for me was when i went on a Saturday a few months ago to meet my sister. She had already ordered a beer which is why i guess they decided not to take my drink for a good 10 minutes. I was finally asked if i wanted a menu. The bartender never acknowledged us again after he gave me the menu. Then one of the managers came to cash out a table looked at me and my sister, who had been finished her beer by now and we were just sitting there, she never acknowledged us either. We sat for a good 20 minutes without any help, and the place was virtually empty. My sister was FINALLY able to flag the manager down again so she could pay for her 1 beer and we left and went next door to Lupe Tortilla. Lupe Tortilla was extremely crowded that night, we managed to snag two seat at the bar when someone got up to leave and were served immediately! We have not been to Fridays since then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Justin T.,"Pearland, TX",1441,254,894,2.0,10/23/2015,"There you used to be a time when I loved this chain.  I am kind of confused on how to rate this place now though. It isn't just this location, but all the TGI FRIDAYS in general.   The food is hit and miss. I took it back to my childhood tonight and ordered chicken fingers. My daughter ordered the chicken fingers, but from the children's menu.  The only difference in the two was the price and the plates they were served on.  There were barely any fries on the adult sized dish. There were more on the children's size basket.  My wife kind of mentioned it to the waiter, not to get more, but just to point out that maybe they should charge for 2 kids meals. The waiter basically just shrugged it off. My son ordered a burger medium, and it was almost well done.  My wife's sizzling chicken and shrimp skillet was definitely sizzling, but the dish was very bland. The mashed potatoes were watery.  Aside from the food, the service was subpar also.  The waiter was friendly, but didn't seem to pay attention to our orders. One of the drinks we ordered from the bar came only after we reminded the waiter about 15 minutes after ordering it.  As much as I used to love this place growing up, it's time to find another place to relive my childhood. Unless of course they bring back the endless appetizers, I just may make an exception!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
K F.,"Houston, TX",1,10,,2.0,5/26/2017,Management has to be non existent!   Walked in and sat ourselves.  The bartender was having a melt down and literally sweating.  Sat at the table for min 10 min without drinks.  Plenty employees working. Just not as a unit.  I know it wasn't just me as I looked up and another customer was complaining that she shouldn't have to go from her table to the bar 4x to order a drink. Watched the manager just observe from the back. Gave no assistance or instruction.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Mitch J.,"Fresno, TX",9,17,16,3.0,4/9/2016,The foods ok but you have plenty items to choose from.  The endless apps will be the way to.  The drinks are what brought us here to kick off the night cap.  Customer service was good even on a busy night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland
Heather D.,"Houston, TX",0,21,7,5.0,1/16/2017,"I came to this restaurant with a group of about 10 people. Our server Ryan was so attentive.

Junior O.,"Edgebrook, Houston, TX",3,13,9,2.0,11/5/2016,Got in to restaurant around 105am and last call was 110. It felt like they wanted us gone before 2. The 2 stars is for the food. Food was decent. Check was given to me before I finished my food and was asked to pay while I was still eating. Just felt so rushed. The restaurant was empty except for our table at 140. I guess everybody else knows the rules to this TGIF. Everybody just wanted out of there by 2. Never experienced this at any other place.

I recently had given up going to all TGIFs (California ones included) after many bad expiriences...(and the only reason I even kept going back was because my husband likes the TGIF franchise) However our last expirience in the pasadena location was so bad we both decided never to return to another TGIF.... Now long story short, I was really bummed when I found out my job was gonna throw a company party at this location...once I arrived with low expectations they were immediately shattered...the food is actually really good HERE..the servers were all very attentive..all their apetizers were so delicious..every single one...the servers kept them coming and all servers seemed to be in such a good mood..they attended to everyone needs and there was a guy whom appeared to be a manager because he was extra attentive and was completely catering to our occassion..This night was such a great expirience i had to return with my husband to show him that there was finally a TGIF i liked...We both returned to this location and he liked it as well.

The sauce made all the difference (Jack Daniels special sauce). Chicken was tender and juicy, not dry. I had broccoli, steamed perfectly, not squishy but not hard.

Fran E. R.,"Mobile, AL",284,91,836,1.0,12/15/2015,"Worst experience of my dining life.  I had no issue with our server being new but to not know what Sesame Jack Strips are is reprehensible.  Those are not only a Friday's FAV item, but a staple dish for the franchise.  As a previous server in the industry, the first rule of business is to try the dishes so you can know what to offer.  Our server Brandy was new but shouldn't have been on the main floor.  She had NO clue what Sesame Jack Strips were and instead of asking, brought us chicken strips w/ fries as an appetizer.  We had to send them back but only after the manager came to make that's what we wanted.  Did I mention at this time we still hadn't gotten our beers?  The meal was down hill after this.  There was a miscommunication/mess up with my order which is too complicated to get into.  Long story short --- she got the order wrong, manager was not apologetic nor did he offer to comp my meal.  I pretty much had to plead with him to do so.  A normal 1 hour meal is now lasting over 2 hours.  I would like and prefer a FULL refund.  I have never had such horrible service, especially with a manager involved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=20

Our server was not very attentive either. Without many patrons in the restaurant their really wasn't any excuse for this. The food in general though, was very good. I had a sizzling steak and spinach dish. It came out hot a sizzling. The steak was cooked just as ordered (medium rare) and was very tender and flavorful. The spinach on the side tasted good when mixed with the glaze that was on the steak. It also came with a tomato and mozzarella salad. This was a nice compliment to the meal.

So who knew TGI would provide me with an enjoyable food experience? The last time I was here the twins were 9 and I swore Never to return.... But as I drove around looking for a ""quick fix"" I.e. No Tex Mex, Vietnamese or BBQ (no full bar) or Italian, I opted against all my normal stops (since it is raining with tornado weather conditions) to give TGI a go.  Well I went in with no expectations, but was quickly enticed by the Ahi Tuna on a tortilla, topped with guacamole, sirrachi and wasabi ranch drizzle(it was Devine). The pretzels in its beer batter cheese Sauce complimented the strawberry Moscow mule perfectly....  Well if you go against your usual bar food menu option and explore a foodie maybe able to find solace and pleasure in the 'burbs at a local franchise...: (maybe), or was I just too excited for a stolen moment away from Mommy Reality?

We go from scolding hot to freezing cold constantly. Many of the surrounding restaurants aren't open for lunch. Texas Roadhouse is next door and is only open for lunch on weekends. On the Border is on the other side and closed down. So, you've basically got Olive Garden and TGI Friday's in this lot. We opted for Friday's.  My Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich was actually quite good. It came with some little fried onions on it. It was messy but good. The sweet potato fries were salty! My friends enjoyed their burgers, soup and sandwich, and chicken dish. Everyone seemed pleased with their food.  I think the food was good but nothing special overall.

Last time I'll be here until they get rid of this smoking policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Nathan P.,"Pearland, TX",11,39,5,2.0,7/28/2014,"The food was okay but the service and waiters were horrid! They took a long time to ask us for what we want (10 minutes), then it took 23 minutes for 2 dishes that we had ordered! In addition, this tgi staff was in the corner and just sitting down chatting with other staffs about a concert and social life. Very unprofessional! Finally, when we asked for the check it took her 5 minutes then when we put the money in, it took 10! Good food bad service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Meryl O.,"Houston, TX",80,75,1,4.0,3/1/2012,"Note: This is a review for the bar and bartenders. Also, keep in mind this is Pearland, and there are limited choices as far as bars or restaurants open past 10 pm go.  I go here relatively often because it is close to where I live and because of the few comparable choices in Pearland. If smoke bothers you, I would avoid this place because patrons can smoke in the bar. They have a pretty good happy hour (I think it is half off of select appetizers), and later at night, the burgers are discounted. Considering it is a large chain restaurant, the potstickers and the wings are good (the inferno wings are pretty spicy). If you are leaning towards a lighter option, the flatbread is also good (they also have more ""skinny"" drink options than most places).  The main reason I like this place is due to the bartenders. They are very friendly and take time to entertain and talk to the customers (also, they tend to pour a good drink). Also, they remember people's names and faces when you come back. On different nights of the week they also have poker and a d.j.  While this isn't a high end martini bar, it's a good place to hang out and have a drink with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Ann R.,"Pearland, TX",65,25,17,4.0,9/17/2014,We usually order off the Jack Daniels menu. Steak  & ribs is really good. We have yet to be disappointed. We are pretty happy coming here for a dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Steven S.,"Dickinson, TX",148,4,6,2.0,3/20/2014,"The service is good enough, but they allow SMOKING.  Needless to say, I won't be going back.

Jarrod A.,"Manvel, TX",0,20,,3.0,8/8/2014,"Food was good.   We had steak and ribs. Good steak and well cooked  a little light on seasoning. I think the bartender was playing games. Waited forever for my beer. I was served Sam Adams instead of fat tire. My son ordered diet coke. Both times they brought the glass, they were something else or mix was way way off.

Whitnie T.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",160,9,10,4.0,8/18/2013,"Never a dull time when I come here! Whether I'm at the bar or seated at a table, with my rambunctious friends or just having dinner with family, I've never been disappointed here.  It's not a gourmet restaurant but the food is pretty decent for what it is and service is impeccable.   The only complaint I have is that whenever I order the spinach dip, it never seems to be hot all the way through but along with chugging some beer, it doesn't bother me after a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Rosy B.,"Pearland, TX",37,3,,5.0,9/17/2015,"I like this place! TGIFs are pretty standard across the board, but whenever I go I am lucky enough to be served by Zach.

G F.,"Pearland, TX",20,146,1,2.0,6/24/2012,"Meh. The slushies are tasty but they aren't real slushies, just a juice drink over packed crushed ice. I thought TGIF was supposed to have good potato skins, but they were pretty bad. Dry potatoes, way too salty, and no green onions (garnishing the sour cream bowl with a few green onion slices doesn't count). The child's mac & cheese made my kid sick that night. Saw another review that they allow smoking in the restaurant. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Shamira D.,"Houston, TX",26,19,13,4.0,4/23/2014,"Been here a few times. Don't really care for the food menu but the drink specials are great. $3 martini Wednesdays is when I'm usually here. I tried a new food entree Sizzling Chicken and Spinach and it was actually pretty good! One downfall, it's located outside of Houston so smoking is allowed at the bar. I don't smoke, so I have to step outside for fresh air on occasion. This location is on my way home from work so it's convenient for me. Plus, they like to give away free food if u sign up for their Stripes program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40

Elizabeth L.,"Pearland, TX",0,7,1,1.0,2/17/2015,Just like chili's their service sucks. I went the night of the super bowl and ordered a few appetizers the pretzel dough was still somewhat raw the pot stickers tasted soggy and expired the wings were not bad and the potato skins had a strange toxic taste to them. Somewhere past midnight I woke up and threw all of it up will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
Deepak I.,"Pearland, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/28/2012,"This place is going from sorry to worse by the day. Horrible service. micro oven food that is stale and sitting some where for several hours. Please save your time, health, money and go some where else to have a good meal. People go out to eat to have some good time and enjoy the food, if we have to eat micro oven food, might as well get from Sam club and heat it up at home for the fraction of the price. I have given then fair chance and that is my mistake. Sorry guys you are a disgrace to the pride of Pearland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=40
David N.,"Houston, TX",4194,3756,2208,3.0,2/7/2010,"With the recent commercials of the 3 course meal I had to check it out, I mean for 12.99 you get a 3 course meal, OUT? Eh...Something that sounds too good usually is. I haven't been to a fridays in years, literally.  But I had a group of friends that didn't know what they wanted to have for dinner so it was one of those times Friday's/Chili's comes to mind even if I hate these mega chains. It also didn't hurt that we had a 10 dollar off coupon.   I had the fried green beans, sizzling parmesan crusted chicken, and the vanilla bean cheesecake.  My friend had the fried cheese, chicken tenders, and the brownie.   The meal started off decent with the appetizers, nothing wrong there fast and simple.  When the entrees came out they were barely warm, my ""sizzling"" tray was no longer sizzling and my friend's tenders and fries were cold.  At this point we were kind of sad. The redeeming factor was the dessert.  The cheesecake was amazing! It was actually plated well.  Yeah tell me about it, when did Fridays get into the market of presentation?  The brownie was amazing.  It was so soft and warm and topped off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So basically, you pay for what you get.  3 courses for 12.99 is a steal, just don't expect the world and you won't be let down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=60
Neff H.,"Houston, TX",1,13,,2.0,7/28/2014,Definitely agree with many of the previous post about the bar. Way too smokey at the bar for anyone to breathe and have a drink.

Courtney A.,"Jacksonville, FL",17,56,70,1.0,6/11/2013,"So I came here the other day and ordered a turkey burger. After three or four bites, the texture just seemed off, as was the color. So I cut it in half, which normally I do to begin with, but I was starving, so I dug in. anyway, the thing is bleeding in the middle. Which, fine if it's beef, but so not fine if it's turkey! So when the waiter comes back, I ask him if it's turkey or beef, he says it should be turkey, so then I show him how it's not fully cooked. He takes it, and a few minutes later brings it back, during, yes the kitchen said its turkey. He says ""do you want another one?"" By this time the kids are ready to go, and quite frankly I'm grossed out!! I politely decline, and he, instead of offering me something else, he just says ""fine, I'll get your bill"". Ok whatever. So come 10 pm that night, I'm laying in bed, and start having horrible stomach cramps. They continue all night, and all day the next day, for over 24 hours. I felt like I was going to vomit, but never did, & I think it's cause I only took a few bites, thankfully, or I would have really been sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=60
Simon L.,"Houston, TX",21,96,36,5.0,3/26/2013,"I""m not giving it 5 stars because it's some super awesome wonderful food.. we know it's TGI Friday's and it's the typical applebees/chili's type food. I'm giving it 5 stars because I came here on Veteran's day and they treated us really well.  Both my girlfriend and I are veterans and we had the list of all the offers that restaurants were holding for the weekend. TGI Friday did not have anything spectacular. It was like a free appetizer or something at a certain time , but we came here anyway for dinner. We ordered a couple of steak dishes, a couple of beers and an appetizer. Only after we ordered did we ask if there was any veteran day deals. Our waitress didn't know so she went to ask the manager. We expected none, but she came back and asked to see our VA IDs. After we showed it to her, she said the manager wanted to comp our entire meal and thank us for our service. The manager never came over to thank us personally, but the gesture was pretty awesome. We enjoyed our meal, left a $20 tip and it made our night. Thank you manger of this TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pearland?start=60
