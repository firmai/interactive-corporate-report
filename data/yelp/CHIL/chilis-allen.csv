She B.,"Allen, TX",0,13,10,2.0,5/19/2016,I was craving a steak. I ordered the 6 P's medium rare to go. I took it home sat down & It was so rare and rubbery! Teach your cook what Medium rare means. One of the worst I've ever had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20

Rebecca O.,"Denver, CO",106,44,43,4.0,1/26/2016,"I've been going to this Chili's for years, but two days ago we had a great experience. The only reason for the loss of one star is because they were out of pickles. We couldn't try the fried pickles, or have pickles on our black bean burgers. Our waitress was Hilary, and she was great! She complimented me when we sat down, apologized for the lack of pickles, brought us our sides of ranch before the meal was even out, and was genuinely kind. We would definitely recommend to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20
Karen H.,"Allen, TX",31,111,5,2.0,8/6/2016,"I remember the days when Chili's was all the rage and one of the best places to eat.  Not so much anymore.  We don't go often anymore, but when we do, it's to the Allen location.  The last three times it hasn't been up to the standard I remember it being years ago.  The food is just not fresh, with the exception of the burgers, which have always been good.  The rest is a disappointment lately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20
Ray M.,"Richardson, TX",0,11,,1.0,1/2/2017,"It was New Years Eve night and I called Chilis to see what time they closed, I was told midnight. I decided to take my kids out for dessert night before midnight, this was the location of choice for me. I live in McKinney and I could have traveled a little more a North but it was getting late. I noticed the parking lot was very empty but walked up to the door to find it open. I stood by the hostess area for a little while to be approached by another server  who told me they where closed, but it was only 10:45 pm. I was a little shocked by that information, as he started to pull out menus looking very annoyed he informed me that they where supposed to be closed but did not want us to order large entrees from the menu. Wow! I could not believe what I was hearing, I was embarrassed he was refusing to serve me the way I had always been served at chilis in the past. The waitress heard the conversation and decided to seat us as he walked away. Apparently the manager told everyone they could leave early, but that was against the rules, she was the only waitress left behind. My kids ate the dessert of course but we did not get what we wanted. Management needs retraining for sure. When the manager came by our table and dropped a dessert off he asked us if we wanted to go boxes. Why would he think that? The kitchen continuously came out to see if we were still eating our desserts, very awkward. We tipped the waitress well, my kids love chilis but I will never spend a dime in there again! That was by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered in all of my years of being served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20

I wore flip flops. A critter crawled across my foot and made me jump and bump my knee.  Yes I said a critter of the multi-legged variety who's name starts with a R and ends with an H.  Oh yeah, it rhymes with COACH. I'm sorry, but I can't return.  The woman behind the bar grabbed me a manager, she comp'd my meal, which was good since I didn't eat it...  we broke camp as suddenly a frozen burrito didn't sound so bad.

Anonymous N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,6,1.0,1/19/2015,"I was here last Saturday with my sis in law. We were seated promptly, assigned a waiter and our orders were taken. I ordered chicken wings for appetizers  the trio fajita and half rack of ribs a side of veggies and rice, while my sis in law ordered their new grilled salmon over rice and veggie. I specifically told this waiter I want my steak on the fajita well done. (Cannot eat rare meat because of personal reasons). The food came on time but the chicken wings were too crunchy and dry. Couldn't even taste any sauce on it.  steak was pink in the middle and the whole trio was tasteless. A little salt for me goes a long way but his dish was so bland I had to put some seasoning on it. The rice with the ribs were cold not even close to warm broccoli tasted uncooked, and hard. My in-law salmon was the only warm thing on her plate everything was stone cold and dry from veggies to the rice. I had a big appetite when I left home but I brought everything else back from chillies home to reseasoned it and warm it up. When I mentioned it to the waiter he didn't even make any effort to apologize.  This is the first chiilis place I've stepped since I relocated from California and I won't be coming back to this place ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20

Dena R.,"Allen, TX",166,195,200,3.0,6/25/2015,"Stopped in for a quick dinner after running errands. We started with the southwestern eggrolls, which have always been a favorite. They were good as always, but have definitely decreased in size from what they used to be. I ordered a burger, but wanted to specify my own toppings, red onion, blue cheese, chili's special sauce, pickles and pepper jack cheese. They used to have a peppercorn burger on the menu and were still able to make it even after it was taken off the menu, but they no longer have the seasoning to make it. I asked for a large side of ranch (I like to dip my burger in it). Bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with onion rings. Seemed to take a little longer than expected, but it was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. My burger was delicious, although it came with blue cheese dressing when I expected blue cheese crumbles. I also only got a small side of ranch but our server quickly corrected both issues. Bf did not like the bun on the sandwich at all. It was described as a potato bun but was way darker than in the menu and looked more like a pretzel bun. Be advised, that is the only bun they have.  Pickles are really good if you like garlic dill pickles, I wished I had ordered the fried pickles after tasting them on my burger. Service was fantastic, we were never without drinks or whatever we needed. I wanted to try the new cinnamon roll skillet dessert but I needed my pants to still fit as I wobbled to the car, maybe next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=20

I waited at the door 4-5 minutes before the hostess realize I was there. He was chatting with the bartender. After we were sat, everything went very well. They do a team service thing so we had 2 servers taking re of us. Our orders were taking almost immediately and our drinks glasses were never empty. I had the Old Timer Burger with cheese and my niece had The Kid's Chicken Alfredo and she loved it.

The bacon and cheese fries were pretty good. I had the half rack of bbq ribs. They were terrible. Dry dry dry all the way to the bone. Cannot believe they served them. My loaded mashed potatoes were okay. My niece had a Cajun chicken pasta dish. She said it tasted like someone opened up a ready made package and dumped it on a plate. This had to be the worst meal at Chili's ever. We decided we will never go back. Not worth the risk of getting terrible food again.

Carly S.,"Allen, TX",44,11,,1.0,11/6/2017,We quit going to this Chili's. Last time we were there it took my family of 5 TWO HOURS to eat. We waited 45 minutes for our food only to get it cold and missing half of our sides! The restaurant wasn't busy and there were so much waitstaff they were standing around gossiping about each other by our table. Unfortunately we've had this similar situation the last 3 times we've been in. So sad because we used to love this Chili's and would meet our friends there but it's really gone down in service this last year. To be honest I am scared to try it again because last time we ate there the kids didn't get their food until almost 9. And I just don't want to take the chance.

Tiffany O.,"Allen, TX",696,34,49,3.0,10/19/2017,Was pretty disappointed with my visit today. Went in at 4pm. Sat at the bar because it was just me and close to my house and was going to just grab a quick bite. Bartender John was very nice and polite when greeting me and I ordered a beer and said I was just in for a quick bite. Already knowing what I want I did skim over the menu to make sure there was no new items and then pushed menu forward. It was shift change and the staff was all standing at the end of the bar catching up or updating night staff from lunch like I would expect. However it did take awhile before I was able to order and then the nachos I had were way over seasoned and unlike how I always get them. I never got a check back until my beer was almost empty and at that point I was so hungry and had to go I just asked for check and box. Felt bad to throw them out it that's exactly what I did when I got home. I knew I should of just grabbed something on the way home but contemplated in my head cuz they usually are on point with the appetizers.  I'll be back because it's convenient but won't make a special trip.

Jean L.,"Barrie, Canada",176,55,22,3.0,5/6/2012,"Chili's offers a decent $20 dinner combo for two. We usually start off with the guac and chips, and hubby orders the chicken fajitas and I'll get the 6 oz steak. I like that they have a cheap menu - it makes me feel like it's okay to not make dinner more often. The downside to their cheap menu is I sometimes feel like the waiters pay more attention to the larger tables where they can make bigger tips. The last time we were there, my steak was undercooked. Instead of waiting in the kitchen for the extra minute to have them cook it a little longer, our waiter hit up three different tables and it seemed like it was 8 minutes before I got my steak. By then my husband had nearly finished his meal.  My feedback would be, if there is a small issue like that with meals, the waiter should have someone bring it right to the table from the kitchen. Then my side dishes would not have been sitting under a heat lamp for such a long time.  We'll still go, because it's decent food and it is a cheap night out. But for great service, I usually  take myself there for lunch and there is a dedicated crew of servers who work hard for their tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Kristin B.,"Dallas, TX",7,11,,1.0,3/11/2013,"I didn't want to give any stars but Yelp requires at least 1 star.  We sat at a table in the bar area and got no service.  2 people walked by without a word and 1 person said they would be right back and they never did.  We asked for a manager, she tried to get us to stay but we weren't.  Left and most likely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Heather S.,"Allen, TX",0,23,,1.0,1/31/2014,"Every time we go to Chili's my husband vows it is the last time.  At this location we ordered an app and our dinners. He specifically asked the app come before the meal (you really shouldn't have to request  this, it used to be assumed) Sure enough... it came out at the same time as the main course. I don't know why so many places can not get this right. We were about to send the app back saying we didn't want it anymore. A manager came by and took our main course back to the kitchen. I asked if it was going to be remade and she assured me that it was.  When we got the main course it was obvious it was the same food just put under a heat lamp. My husband couldn't finish more than a couple bites of his order. The chicken was like rubber.  I picked my hamburger apart bc the bun was inedible and ate half of the burger patty.  We got fast food on the way home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Bill L.,"Allen, TX",25,6,,2.0,1/20/2013,"Pretty decent food is overwhelmed by smoke in the non-smoking section. The laughable partition between the areas is completely ineffective, as people(servers) walking between the areas pull in clouds of smoke to the non-smoking area. Just gross. We used to eat here all the time, but there are tons of other, better, options in Allen that are smoke free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Curtis Humanities S.,"Allen, TX",0,21,2,4.0,6/3/2014,"The Big Chili: Chili's Review                                                                                   2EE On May 31, 2014, my father and I went out to eat at Chili's. We arrived around 6 PM, ready to see what they had in store for us today. We got out of the car and were welcomed by a clean parking lot, a greeter at the door, and a comfortable setting in the restaurant.  Atmosphere *** - The parking lot was clean with quite a few cars here and there. There was no trash on the sidewalks or in the parking lot. I did notice, however, that there were a few cigarette butts on the lawn outside of the restaurant. There were flowers out front, with a clean sidewalk with a strip of land with rocks on it next to it. The bushes were neatly trimmed and the trees were neatly trimmed as well. There were no leaves or branches on the ground and the gardening was clean and neat. The restaurant had a Tex-Mex theme with the Chili's sign with a giant chili next to it. Unfortunately, there was no greeter there to open the door for us, so we walked in ourselves. Once we were inside, a young lady stood there ready to seat us. She smiled and made eye contact with us immediately. She said hello and made some small talk with us. She was standing at attention and not slouching over or looking annoyed. She looked ready to greet anyone who walked through the doors. The restaurant had a dim lighting to it, but there was enough light to see thanks to the electrical system and plenty of windows. The noise wasn't a big issue; we could talk at a comfortable level and still hear the other person clearly. There was light music playing in the background which added to a comfortable setting. When we arrived at our booth, it was wiped down and clean. There was no trash on the table, floor, or bench where we sat. I looked at my utensils and they were pretty clean. I happened to notice that there was a spot on my knife. I scratched at it, and they spot came off. So my knife wasn't completely clean, it still had food on it.  Service **** - Once we were seated, a waiter quickly came over to serve us. He smiled, made eye contact, and said hello. We ordered our drinks and were served quickly after. He was fast about it. While my father and I talked, the waiter brought a refill without asking for my dad. That was very kind of him, and smart too. We ordered our food, and waited until it came. They had a small ""tablet"" where you could play games while you waited or ate. Unfortunately, there was one glitch out of the many times we did trivia.  Food *** - When our food finally arrived, it wasn't cold, but not hot either. It was still pretty warm when it arrived. Our burgers were warm and juicy. The fries were salty and still warm and not cold. The food was pretty good, and the comfortable setting made it even better. When we were finished, I ordered a chocolate milkshake to go. It was in a Styrofoam cup with a straw ready to go in it. The shake was thick, and a little hard to get out of the straw, but it was cold and tasted a lot like chocolate.  Overall**** (4 stars) - Chili's is a good, clean restaurant you will want to visit if you want a comfortable setting for a family, or a dinner for two. The food and presentation was good, the setting was great, and the service was fast. To have dinner at a restaurant would take about an hour and thirty minutes. It took us forty minutes to get in and out, which was fast. Chili's is a restaurant I highly recommend to have lunch or dinner at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Carla S.,"Allen, TX",2,173,1,3.0,9/2/2013,"Picking up to-go orders is nice, friendly and usually quick.  I love their salads and sometimes swing by on my way home from work to get one.  The dining room service isn't as good so i don't often dine in especially when I'm by myself.  It's clean and again, I love their salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Francis D.,"Little Elm, TX",1,1,,1.0,12/15/2013,Horrible service doesnt even describe it!  Waited for over an hour for incorrect order and cold food.  Manager Crystal was incredibly rude.  Unacceptable unless you like being treated like they are doing you a favor.  They offeed to take care of our bill when we were not even interested in eating the food.  We didnt want free dinner.  We wanted good service and the food we had ordered.  I will be contacting their manager Chanda Kelly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Deni G.,"Allen, TX",1,28,3,3.0,1/18/2016,"Average experience. It was early on a slow Monday evening. Walked in and waited a couple minutes to be greeted and seated. Finally what seemed to be Bus boy seated us after walking us around the whole dinning area. Sat down with menus, looked through them and decided what we wanted. Again waited a few minutes wondering if we had a waitstaff. Finally a waitress showed up and took our drink order. Then food order. Chips and guacamole were very good. We both ordered bacon burger. The burger was ok, but too much sauce (whatever kind it was, it was not too complementary to the burger. It also made the burger messy and difficult to eat.) and a little too much pepper (and I like pepper.) we had to flag the waitress down for a drink refill.  We had a gift card that covered the cost of the meal. Paid with the table kiosk, but wanted to give the waitress the tip. Never saw her again. She kept hiding in the back. I hate leaving cash on the table, so I hope she got it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Kelsey M.,"McKinney, TX",86,15,39,4.0,1/10/2011,"I went here this past friday and figured it would be like ever other chain Chili's. I was actually pleasntly surprised. One one side they had normal bar where many had crowded to watch the A&M and LSU game, while the other side was the normal table area. Thats where i noticed the biggest change.  The decor was very modern and fun. The booths were comfy and roomy and the menus were already at the table (no hostess needed). I was already beginning to be impressed.  The next thing was the menu, they had some really good but different foods than what I have come to expect from the average bar and grill place. I had the cream corn soup and the chicken margaherita. Both excellent.  The service was excellent as well they had 2 large parties (20+) from what I could see and there was neither a problem from the waitstaff nor the kitchen.  Needless to say I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
D C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,6,3,5.0,1/27/2013,"I see that there are several negative reviews for this particular Chili's but I believe the experience just depends on your waiter or waitress. We enjoyed a family outing last Friday night and, both, the food and the service were great. I wish I could remember our waitresses name, but she was great. She even gave us to-go drink cups in the end. 5 stars for this Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
Melissa F.,"Plano, TX",3,7,,1.0,11/1/2011,"This Chilis has been consistantly bad.  I have been there for lunch at / just after the lunch rush (11:00 ish - 2:00 ish).  All three times I've been to this location, the servers were nowhere to be found, our orders were incorrect, and the food was bleh.  Therefore, I invoked the three-strike rule.  Sad, because it's a very convenient locale. The second time we went there, I ordered the chicken quesadillas on the lunch menu, and my companion had a burger (which, once again, they screwed up).  40 minutes later, no food.  Keep in mind, it took about 20 minutes just to get regular drinks and order the food, so now we're at 60 minutes (and we're on lunch break!).  The tables around us were pretty empty, I guess they just had one or two servers?  I wouldn't have as big a problem if it was crowded...but the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full. Anyway, the manager comes over to ask how our experience was, and we told him.  He said he'd fix us up with coupons for next time - and handed over a whopping $5.00 Chilis Bucks thing.  Hey, thanks, man. This last time, again, hardly any people in the tables, but our food took over 45 minutes to come.  When it finally did (after the waitress actually threw her hands up when we dared to ask about it for a second time - and no, we were not rude), it was the wrong thing for two out of three orders!  Ended up leaving without hardly eating anything, and what we had was again bleh. I will not be going there again.  If you like Chilis food, I'm guessing this is typical fare - but you'd better be ready to cough up some serious wait time and deal with substandard service if you come to this location around lunch time.

Rebecca G.,"Allen, TX",61,304,641,3.0,6/5/2011,"Boneless buffalo wings are great. Sante Fe Spring Rolls are even better. Yum. We are always happy with our orders...ribs, burgers, sandwiches, etc. This time we ordered one Patron pomegranate margarita, not realizing it was $8.79 ish. Dang. Not cool. Mango margarita on the other hand is an amazing drink at a normal price. Service was very good. They have a bar which allows smoking. The smoke doe NOT make its way into the restaurant. They often (always?) have a great deal for 2 people (2 meals, one appetizer, one desert, $20?). They have a great To Go system too; very efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-allen?start=40
