3,Paula M.,"London, United Kingdom",77,334,1727,2.0,2015-02-10,"In my younger days I was a fan of TGI's less so now in general. This one is located near the Croydon 'Airport'.  I think there may be a tram stop nearby but generally it is a drive with parking available at the back. Even though this TGIs is rather out of the way, you generally find that you do have to book so be aware!  It does tend to get rather busy. Usual TGI set up with decor, bar area for a pre-drink and food being 'American diner' type.  Burgers, ribs (which are usually very good, fall of the bone meat good), fries and calorie laden salads. Good range on the menu and on the cocktail side.  Caters well for Kids with special menu but also things to keep them occupied. If you have a birthday event there, they usually get the restaurant to do a round of happy birthday to you and possibly crown you with a balloon hat also. Service is usually pretty 'American friendly', service can be hit and miss depending on who you get and how busy they are but generally the waiting staff try hard. From what is available in that area, it is one of the better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-croydon,,,,,
1,Ronald T.,"Crystal Palace, London, United Kingdom",30,335,2160,3.0,2016-05-03,"Not sure how I feel about TGI's anymore. I used to like the food and the atmosphere. Now I'm not sure about the food or atmosphere, am I just getting old? The food portions didn't seem as big as I remember but that is probably true of most places eateries of today. The food is tasty but seemed a little greasy, perhaps it was just my portions or my taste buds have changed. I am certain that TGI's have always been noisy and that was part of the attraction. After the 2nd (or was it the 3rd) birthday celebration it's a bit grating. I do wonder how the staff do it day in day out? I'm sure the birthday recipient enjoys the attention, well I hope they do. The staff were very good efficient in their service and courteous throughout the evening. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon but if you like that thing then why not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-croydon,,,,,
2,Dean M.,"Sutton, United Kingdom",0,3,2,3.0,2016-08-31,"The staff were very welcoming which is always nice. Our waitress was friendly but not very smiley, to be fair she did look a little rushed, but nonetheless she could have smiled a little more... We had nachos and a ' bucket of bones' ( chicken and ribs) to start which were ok, the bucket was tasty but not very big for the price - 11£ For mains we had ribs, burgers and vegetarian fajitas. The ribs were great the veggie fajitas were very nice...the burgers were horrible - very dry and not at all like the picture! The price of the meal was about 30£ per head with drinks Overall we had a good time and would return...but wouldn't have the burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-croydon,,,,,
0,James B.,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",1,36,25,3.0,2016-09-25,"TGI's are pretty standard wherever you go - they're quite noisy, service is usually good and the food is of a decent standard. The Purley Way restaurant is no different, the service was friendly, if a little slow (they did apologise) and the food was tasty. I highly recommend the Jack Daniel's Loaded Fries that keep drawing me back! Price is what you'd expect, you can get a meal for two for around £30 - really not bad for a quick meal if you're in the area and don't fancy all the fast food in the Colonnades opposite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-croydon,,,,,
