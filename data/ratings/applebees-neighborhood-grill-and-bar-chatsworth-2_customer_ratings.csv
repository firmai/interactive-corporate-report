I don't find this place to be unique or should I say nothing about it makes it stand out (IN MY EYES) the service isn't the greatest and even the ambiance in the place is not all that excitiing. The food has been good/ OK nothing horrible which saves them from a 1 star or NO STARS. This last time though the fries and the spinach artichoke dip were excellent. Like I said I'm just not there yet! not to the point where I can say I'm a fan there is something missing! They do have TV'S and a bar area but It just doesn't do it for me.

Best plate i could have asked for it was really good.  I would def. come back to this place. there was no waiting time. We were well taken care of. They were super nice.

This place closed for a year or more but is open again and doing a good business. I think they had franchise problems. They used to have REALLY good margaritas made with lime juice instead of sour mix, but they don't anymore. sniff. The thing I do like about this place is that they have a 2 for $20 and a 2 for $24 meal deal that is very affordable for couples to go out and not spend a fortune. The portions are decent and with the appetizer, you'll definitely be full when you leave. They also have a nice Weight Watchers menu for those of us trying to eat healthy.

I'm not too sure if this is including weekends tho. This includes half priced specific appetizers and lower priced drinks. The service at this particular location was AMAZING!! People that weren't even our servers were making an effort to make our dinning experience a great one without us even having to ask them. We got two orders of wings, which come in classic buffalo, sweet and spicy and a few other ones and we got crispy wonton tacos I believe, They were all really good and came out VERY quick.

On January 11, 2013 at 11 pm three friends of mine and myself visited Applebee's in Chatsworth, Ca. To kickstart my birthday weekend Two of my friends ordered alcoholic beverages Jonathan Chambers the server asked for IDs walked off with one claiming his managers approval was needed the ID belonged to my friend who had came to visit from Washington for my birthday He came back and threw the ID on the table and said ""My Manager Isn't Going To Accept This"" Confused we asked what the problem was my friend handed him a 2nd form of id which was a Mexican ID that are issued to mexican americans when visiting the state as a form of identification He Grabbed the ID and with a smirk on his face said ""yeah we're definitely not accepting this"" As he threw the ID on the table again it was rude and un called for but most importantly racist so we asked to speak to the manger Umit Keskin general manager of the location,came to our table then told us he scanned her ID and it didn't match the system We couldn't understand how that was possible considering we've been to that Applebee's before and they never had a problem with her ID Neither has the DMV or any other restaurant we've visited and as far as im concerned restaurants dont even have a scanner to do that so he lied. it was obvious that he had to interest in listening to our complaints and he definitely had no intention of making us feel better about the situation it was then I asked for his name and the servers name and told him I'd be reporting the situation to their Corporate office as well as the bbb he again showed no care and told me to go ahead and do so.

The game was on but not on all TVs, the service- well the waitress we had was really sweet and on-top of our refills so that was great.  The food was ok. We did the 2 for $24 deal and usually that's great- you get lots of variety and good food- well at other places that offer it.  from what we ordered: -fried green beans-  they were ok-  the sauces that come with 'em are pretty gross though and not very fitting -boneless wings- a bit too much batter and fat on them, good as an appetizer since you're starving but too much after a good 3- you're over them -alfredo penne w/ chicken-  VERY BLAND-  they just put a tiny amount of alfredo sauce- so it was very dry, no flavor, and the tomatoes on it makes it strange and adds an overbearing taste.  -fiesta fettuccini-  (something like that)  also VERY BLAND AND DRY.  I wasn't very pleased with the food here, it's like low-budget frozen meals  the atmosphere also- well the type of people that were in there were less than casual, and not the kind you want to dine around.  I know that the bar area is cool for evening happy hours, but the food is just too bland.

Normally, I stop by here for happy hour which is typically served at the bar but since they didn't have any booths available they sat us somewhere else but still honored the happy hour prices. Another notable factor when it came to service is that they are always willing to split the bill which is awesome because some people carry cash and others only have their card; it just makes things easier. Food Typical American food, hamburgers, pastas, sandwiches, ribs, blah, blah, blah . . . The food is okay, not bad, and it gets the job done.

Manager comes over and is like I heard you're missing something. I'm like yes, we got our entrees but not our appetizer, we wanted to eat the appetizer first. Shes like do you still want them? I'm like no not really, isnt the point of  appetizers to come before the entrees? She's like depends how you order them?

She explained anything we had questions on from the menu, and we ended up doing the 2 for $24, spinach artichoke dip, mac n cheese with chicken strips, and a half rack of ribs. Spinach artichoke dip was good! The serving size was pretty hefty as well, so you could definitely split it more than 2 ways. My hubby was satisfied with his ribs, but I can't say more on that. The mac and cheese was good! I'm not a bacon fan, but that's my fault for not looking at the full description. Oops. :P The chicken on top also had an awesome sauce on it, so I was happy!

Food: There were three of us, so we got the 2 for $20 deal and another dish. We ended up with boneless sweet and sour wings, cowboy burger, oriental chicken salad, and 4 cheese mac with honey pepper chicken. In total with drinks it was about $40, pretty good deal. Food comes out quick even though the restaurant was pretty crowded (Sunday dinner time).  The boneless wings were too salty, way to salty and tasted nothing like sweet and sour. Pretty sure it was classic buffalo sauce but they said it wasn't. Cowboy burger was actually the best thing we got. Thick patty with bacon, onion strings and bbq sauce; what's not to like about that. Comes with a small amount of bland tasting fries. We got crispy chicken with the oriental salad, good choice since it added texture to the salad that it needed. Was expecting a more vinaigrette like dressing but it was a thicker creamier dressing and it wasn't so good. The mac and cheese was pretty bland to, pretty sure there wasn't 4 cheeses in there, only saving grace with that one was the chicken, I can probably eat a bucket of that.   Service: There was a line when we got there but the wait was only 15 mins. Asked for a table of three and they only brought 2 menus and 2 utensil pack things. Server seemed out of it and not caring. I understand it being a little late and the dinner crowd but at least show some effort. I'd rather you try and fail instead of not trying at all. If service was better the experience would have been better. The person that brought the food out was really nice though. Drink order was messed up and lagged a little in getting it corrected. Tipped accordingly.  Location: Nice location really. On the outside of the Pacific Winnetka Theatre plaza. Right next to Habit and a Japanese Restaurant. Parking is plentiful and plenty of lighting.

It definitely appeared that she was a bit overwhelmed carrying the load of her coworkers, although this did not phase her one bit.  Unfortunately, there were several mistakes in regards to our order and request due to the fact that she was delegating the request onto others who were failing miserably.  I can see how hard she was working and appreciated her follow up with us to make sure the task she assigned to others were completed with success.  She seemed more upset than us that her fellow staff members were dropping the ball over and over again.  Every error she discovered was quickly corrected and she seemed to be genuinely apologetic so we never felt angry or frustrated that our meal was being compromised.   She even went as far as getting her manager involved and removing the appetizer from our bill and offering a 10% discount on the remaining bill.  This was not expected since we did not request or complain about any of the mistakes.  That's just how observant and caring our server was!!! Overall the meal was still very good and the taste of everything was to our expectations.  The experience as a whole could have been a disaster if it were not for our passionate server and her keen eye.   I can't express how much we appreciate this type of service!!

I mean, maybe you could argue that but anyone that has been to Happy Hour here can tell you that it is a pretty good deal.  Most of the drinks (even the normally expensive ones) are $5 or less. My premium vodka is $5.50 and the Long Island Iced Teas are $3.75. Some shots are $3! And when you drink, some of the appetizers are 50% off. We tried all of them and the wings are good, the mozerella sticks and the chicken wonton tacos are great!! Honestly, I can't really vouch for the food other than the appetizers.  I love the appetizers and the prices of the alcohol.

My wife just had chicken strips. I guess how can you mess that up. The Diet Pepsi that came was flat and I was trying to make out what exactly it tasted like.

It was pretty consistent as far as service and food goes but I don't know what happened but this place is consistently bad. Ok it's not like your going to get a fine dinning experience at a chain restaurant and that was not what I was expecting. However you should be able to get decent food. Nope not here honestly my food tasted like cafeteria food, not good. I just have to say do not get the pasta it was over cooked and gummy twice. The sauce was bland so you can imagine a bland sauce onto of a sticky, gummy noodle. Yuk just had a food flash back. I sent it back and chose not to replace it with anything else as my husband and daughters food was also not good. On top of the bad food our server was bad. It was so dead in there and you would think it was packed with the slow inattentive service we received. Our server was not friendly and seemed to not get the basics. The one thing I can say was the manager was very nice. Came over to our table and apologized for everything. I felt like she was sincere but at that point i was over it. I will not go back again.

Our waitress was great, as always, but she was juggling a lot of customers.  My suggestions would be as follows:   1. Fire whoever/whomever has decided to cut salad portions.   2.  Schedule more staff on busy nights.   Again, our waitress had an excellent personality, and worked her tail off, but she was being pulled in so many directions, we didn't receive our usual great service - we don't blame her.  Perhaps my skimpy salad, with less-than-quality shrimp, was due to the kitchen being understaffed as well...

Well lets just say the second time around confirmed my decision to not eat at Applebee's ever again.  It was a whole of group of us that came on a Friday afternoon around 1pm and the place did not look as busy as I thought it would be. Our server was nice however I don't think she did a good job keeping up with our big group. First off she forgot to bring me a glass of water after I had to remind her a couple times and it wasn't until we got our food after a good 45 minute wait that she finally gave me my glass of water. We all pretty much ordered the 2 for $20 deal that included an appetizer, entree, and two sides. I ordered the artichoke and spinach dip with chips for my appetizer which was good. However, I wish they would of at least brought out our appetizers to munch on while we waited for the rest of our food. For my entree I ordered a medium well steak which ended up tasting dry and hard to chew. I had to put a lot of A-1 sauce just to get some flavor and moistness to the steak. My sides included garlic and butter green beans and sweet potato fries. I was disappointed with the green beans because only a section of green beans had garlic and butter sauce and was not properly coated on all the green beans on my plate. Overall I felt our food felt rushed and was put together in a hurry. Food quality was low and service was poor.

But some of our dishes required fryers for smaller items like tortilla strips so some substations were offered but not for all the dishes. This was the beginning of the inconstancy.  Our waitress was nice but her performance became dull. We ordered two drinks from the bar (we were seated at a booth next to the bar). Took about 20 mins to get our drinks because the waitress  said the bartender was busy with another guest. (Which we could see was clearly not the issue as the bartender was singing and dancing around her station). I saw when she made both cocktails it probably took less that 5 minutes to make both. I had an Adios MF which was so weak and diluted because about 20% of the drink was ice (I could barely move my straw).  Order came out wrong after taking forever to serve, even though it was only us and a few other tables as well as majority of the food we ordered didn't required fryers and they weren't making substitutes for the little part of the dish that did need it. Also, apparently you can't order roasted potatoes when the fryers are down? (They are supposed to be ""roasted"") Don't understand why they took a lifetime.

45,Sarah Y.,"Canoga Park, CA",77,117,3.0,3.0,2016-10-20,"I'm anxious to see how the service and food is. There website for ordering in advance is VERY frustrating. We start work at 5AM, so our lunch time is usually around 11:00 or so. The website says that the restaurant car side to go hours are from 11AM -9pm . So, I figured if I order a couple of hours ahead, the order should be ready to pick up  by 11:15  latest.  After I got everyone's order from the office picked, I went to the payment page and that's where my frustration began.  I found that the 11:15 AM was not an acceptable time when I went to submit the order; hence, all of the credit card information I put in was cleared. So, I used 11:30AM and pressed ""place order"" again. This time, an error came up saying that the credit card number was invalid. So, I fixed the number and hit ""place order"" again. Again, all the credit information was cleared and I had to re-type my credit card information again.  Whoo hoo, it finally went through. I hope they really get my order. I will call to confirm. After reading some of the Yelper's comments about bad customer service, I am a little worried. I will update! Ok, so the ONLY reason I am bumping this up to a 3 is because Fernando was sooooooooo helpful, empathetic to my ordeal with the website; plus we had a coupon, so the bill was very reasonable. Do not order the Chicken Cavatappi, unless you have at least salt and pepper. It is REALLY bland.  They need to maybe put some sun dried tomatoes, a little more basil and some parsley, a little seasoning salt and pepper. If the Sun dried tomatoes are too expensive then maybe some dill or rosemary? The house salad is actually pretty good. It has a lot of different kinds of stuff in it. I had my wn dressing at work, so I can't rate any of their dressing. But one order had the oriental chicken salad and the person swears the dressing is the best they have had. The 1/2 club sandwich that came with one of the grilled lunches was just OK.  The Two mini hamburgers with fries and a soda was ok.    If I have another coupon available, maybe I'l order something else on the menu.

5,N G.,"Malibu, CA",0,5,,2.0,2017-01-06,"My boyfriend and I frequent this location at night  because it's convenient and the food is consistently good. We've had a blonde female sever twice who was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and prompt. If she had served us tonight, this would be a 5 star review. I wish I remembered her name because she deserves to be praised.  This particular visit was AWFUL. We waited over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and given a table. Needless to say, we gave up waiting and sat at the bar top for some drinks and appetizers. We realized it was nearing closing time so we planned on ordering our food to go while having a beer or 2 while waiting for our food.  (Trying to make it easier on them). The bartender grabs menus and we told her we already knew what food we wanted to order. We ordered our food and never saw her again. I mind you, WE WERE AT HER BAR TOP. She never offered us ANY drinks or EVEN water, at all. And when we called her over to order a beer, she completely ignored us. She was literally 2ft away from us behind the bar and still no reaction.  Fed up at this point, we look at the check and see that she charged us full price for our happy hour appetizers. I wanted to clarify with her if the reasoning was because we ordered our food to go, (which is understandable) but she wasnt available to speak to about it. We decided to cut out losses, pay the bil, and get the heck out of there.  I've spent many years in the service industry so I can be very sympathetic with servers and bartenders. But this was a case of complete disregard of our needs and overall disrespect and carelessness to us as customers. It's extremely hard and very rare for me to leave a tip less that 20%, but the occasion called for it. The food was consistently good (as always) and this has been my only bad experience so I may return and sit with an actual server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40,3.52,3.21,3.21,2.6000000000000005,3.334
101,Lon M.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,62,3.0,2.0,2017-01-06,"Starting on a good note my wife seems to love the food here. Me not so much. First I don't like the service at this location and never really have. You'd think after all the many bad reviews on the service at this location they would have cared to do something about it by now but they don't care here. Nor does the upper management for Applebee's chain either. This place is service with all young adults mostly that don't seem to care much or provide all that great of service. This is a yuppie joint for young people. A bar basically surrounded by a restaurant just like the garbage Red Robin chains.  They seem to change their menu too often. They use to have this pretty good chips and dip on the menu, then it was just taken off. All the other appetizers at Applebees is mediocre nothing special. The pretzel thing with beer dip whatever is not all that great after a few bites. The steaks here are nothing better than  you could get at any Sizzler. Too much money for what you get imo. Not worth it. They have a bit better steaks at Chili's for around the same price. Really the only item on Applebbe's entire menu that I like is the fish & chips. I'm glad I found something I like to eat there at least seeing my wife likes this place so much. I get annoyed coming here. I don't like the crowd and noise and the servers here are too busy to give a rats about the service for any particular table. Been here numerous of times and it's always that way. You need anything, usually you have to stop someone to ask because the waiter can't be found. Another of many joints who take your order and then have somebody else bring out your food. Then you hardly ever see the waiter or waitress again to get drink refills or whatever you might want. Has happened on most every visit I can remember.  Also, after being here A FEW TIMES THE RESTROOM SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN AND IT IS NOT! On 2-3 visits the men's bathroom is out of towels and the bathroom a bit filthy and you can tell it hasn't been cleaned properly. I mean after 2-3 visits and the same thing? Come on! Management here doesn't care. Notice by all the replies the management has left on the reviews here? LOL.  The Food: Besides the fish, the rest of the food I've ever ordered here (steaks, burgers, appetizers) is all just blah boring food and nothing special. Not even worth the money they ask imo.  Got to agree with another reviewer on here about the parking. The lot at this location sucks, is not handicap friendly at all because the entrance is way out on the street instead of the parking lot and if there is a long wait at this place I instantly want to leave because it's very uncomfortable with no room to sit hardly at all. Not even worth a 10min wait here. Loud inside and not a place to have a nice quiet diner at all. Or good service. And the background music they play is Taylor Swift and annoying yuppie new techno music.  If it wasn't for my wife liking this place I would never eat here.  And this is one of the very few restaurants that doesn't have Clam Chowder soup on Fridays? Wth? lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=120,3.44,3.2,3.2,2.6960000000000006,3.2960000000000007

We sat ourselves at the bar area tables and waited about 10 minutes with nobody coming around to give us a menu. I went to the hostess and asked how we get menus. She asked where we were seated so she could send someone over. Seems like a normal question except there were only a few other tables occupied in the bar area and she saw exactly where I was sitting. Anyways, I pointed to where she saw me get up and she said she would send a waitress over. About 5 more minutes go by and a waitress comes up to us and says ""we don't usually go to tables if they don't have a menu"". What? How are we supposed to get the menu? We order an appetizer and a margarita (no salt on it even though there was supposed to be, which is not a big deal at all but it just goes to show how lazy the staff is) and say we need  a second before we know what food we want. About 5-10 minutes go by and she hasn't checked to see what food we want yet. She only had one other table. At this point we have been at a table for probably 20 minutes and still haven't ordered our dinner, so we decide we can't take it anymore and we went to BJ's and had a great dinner.

185,Cynthia D.,"Sylmar, CA",266,130,408.0,2.0,2017-12-06,"About a week ago before going to watch Coco in Spanish at the nearby Pacific theatre, I met up with friends here for food and drinks. We thought it was awesome that they had a wide variety of options for Happy Hour at decent prices. It was 4 of us and 2 of us got there before and ordered drinks right before our friends arrived but they ordered almost right after us. The reason for the 2 was that the service was extremely slow. Maybe they were short staffed or something but there is no excuse on my friends waiting for their drinks for a really long time and they would probably be still waiting for them if I hadn't called our server over. We ordered some food and it was ok, not bad but not spectacular either. I was really hungry, so anything would taste good to me. We ended up ordering another round of drinks and again they took a really long time. The thing that bothered us the most was that we had a clear view of the bar and the bartender took forever to get to making our drinks. It was not busy at all and instead she was talking to another customer at the bar, instead of making our drinks. Overall, not the best experience and don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2,2.56,3.02,3.068,,2.8360000000000003
184,Jacquline B.,"Los Angeles, CA",264,11,5.0,3.0,2017-12-16,This is a good family place to eat.. BUT!!! The young employees just stand around takes them way to long to clean a table for customers. I went yo the restroom and noticed 3 tables that were just sitting with dirty dishes and when I came from the restroom they were still sitting there plus it was 4 familys waiting to be seated. The food is good no problem there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2,2.56,3.03,3.064,,2.8419999999999996

My review will consist of my many visits to the bar. I am proud to announce that my very two favorite bartenders here at Angela & Suzy. They are very attentive and more than welcoming in engaging in a very friendly conversation while they multi-task. They are never too busy when it comes to provide good quality service. Especially when the L.I.T. drinks are keeping the night LIT! These two bartenders go together like Dr.Dre & Snoop, Bert & Ernie, Beavis and Butthead, Spongebob & Patrick, well, you get the picture. Great service all around! I started coming recently not to long ago and noticed that they got rid of the Dodgers and Lakers wall paper near the bar area. What was that about? the replacement decor is giving it a yardhouse feel too it. Any who, come by and have a drink or two, or too many. Have a great time and if you see me across the bar, buy me a drink!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2,2.68,3.03,3.076,,2.8899999999999997

I called to confirm and he completely forgot and acted like he had no idea what I was talking about on top of being rude. I had to go in a second time to set up a date and waited 20 minutes to speak to the female manager because she was ""too busy"" to speak to me.

But the service really sucked. Our waitress didn't stop by our table to make sure everything was okay and refill our drinks. We had to track her down. She wasn't welcoming at all and was actually kinda rude.

I ordered a 6oz stake and my date ordered a 8oz stake. When we received the plates, my date's stake looked like a 4oz stake :O It was so tiny! He told the waitress there was a mistake on the stake size and she didn't even look at the stake, she just said ""I imputed 8oz stake in the tablet"" like wtf!! Lady look at the damn stake!!

As a vegetarian there was very little to choose from the menu. Other than the spinach dip  and chips and some salads, there was not much if a selection.  Applebees  really needs to update their menu. As for the service, at this particular location it could be better. Our waiter completely  forgot our appetizer and she brought our main dish out instead. We ended up having our appetizers  after the entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2,2.28,2.97,3.056,,2.694

I got a grilled chicken with vegetables at the bar. It was crowded and hard to hear anyone, but...that's the chain game. It's probably more pleasant in a booth or something, or if I dug up some date but if you go alone ona weekend, expext elbows to nudge you out. The grilled chicken was dry and overcooked.
