Sarah A.,"Pembroke, MA",0,9,,3.0,2/14/2015,"Significantly understaffed, leading to long waits to be seated, to be waited on and to be served.

Stefanie P.,"Carver, MA",0,8,,2.0,1/2/2015,"We are huge fans of Red Robin and this was our first visit to the Plymouth location. We arrived just after 7pm tonight (fri) and were told a 25 min wait. That's expected for a busier time, but there were several empty tables just not being used which was slightly annoying. Luckily we were sat after maybe 15-20 min and had a very friendly waitress Liz. We put in our order right away and she brought us our water and beer immediately. Liz also gave us an iPad to sign up for the rewards card and helped us get it started. Unfortunately it took almost an hour to get our food. We have never waited that long at a Red Robin. We got the whiskey BBQ burger and the burnin love burger.... Both were good, the burnin love was slightly undercooked. We both felt the burgers themselves were very thin. The majority of our Red Robin experiences were in PA and the burgers always seemed a lot thicker. The other issue was the bathrooms. The women's room had 4 stalls... 2 were occupied, 1 was disgusting and unusable, and 1 the lock didn't work. 1 of the stalls in the men's room was also clogged. Overall we were quite disappointed with this experience and will be looking for the next closest location for our next visit. Luckily our waitress was great, otherwise this would've been a 1-star. Hopefully the Plymouth location can make some improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=40

Jim C.,"Plymouth, MA",1,180,77,2.0,12/29/2011,"I have been to this location of this chain several times.  I usually sit at the bar and have noticed that i have never seen the same bartender twice.  the bar has maybe 10 stools and there is usually an open seat or 8.    Service from the bartenders is hit or miss as they handle take-out and the service bar as well. Burgers can be ordered with ""some pink"" or ""no pink.""  I usually get ""some pink""  The burgers are very good.  The fries are bottomless.  They are standard, frozen steak fries but they are usually fried perfectly.  Try some of the Red Robin seasoning on them.  It is similar to Old Bay seasoning found in Maryland.   Service on this particular night was probably the worst I have had as it seemed that I was an afterthought.  The two (2) bartenders were friendly enough but just not very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=40

Julie C.,"Boston, MA",139,572,20,3.0,1/26/2009,"This place is like a fast food joint with a full bar. You walk in and are just overwhelmed with the decor, tons of posters and pictures up similiar to a TGI Fridays. The burgers, they have a great selection of many different kinds of burgers here. You can get some with pineapple, a fried egg, chili cheese, guacamole-so many varieties!  I opted for the cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese. I like how the cheeseburger isnt made with your usual cheddar or american. you actually get a selection! and the fries are bottomless!! score for the steak fries! these are especially good if you pour some of the red Robin seasoning on them! The service here is ok. nothing too crazy, our waiter came here when he was needed. it wasn't busy but it was packed with families with a few birthdays! oh watching the staff sing happy birthday is a riot, they all look sooo happy...hahah this is a cool place for a burger, its better than your average fast food but definately not gourmet like they say...but at least they have a bar, so thats makes up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=40

I have never been offered seconds. But then again I usually don't finish what  have. I do have to mention however my disappointment with a bar drink last night. I ordered the Absolut freckled lemonade. It was quite refreshing but I am positive that there was no Absolut in it. For $8 I figured I would get a little relaxed.

Elizabeth C.,"Middleboro, MA",0,10,,3.0,1/27/2014,"I used to work at the Red Robin in Greenville, SC, and have a lot of fond memories there so I'm giving 3 stars.  I would like to mention that the standards were very high at that particular Red Robin.  Then again, I left to come back to MA in early 2008 so a lot may have changed since then.  In any event. My family and I went to the Plymouth RR last night and I ordered my all time favorite Whiskey River BBQ burger with a cup of French Onion soup to start, and a side of broccoli.  We were told the kitchen was out of broccoli.  No biggy, but I did start to get a little antsy that it was taking so long for the soup to come out.  Finally, our burgers arrived and I mentioned that I never got my soup.  Our server seemed to feel bad, and even said that she specifically said to get the FRON out first (but if it was something you were so concerned about, why not check on it periodically?  But I digress). It ended up working out OK, since the onions on my burger were soggy like worms.  It completely grossed me out; I was expecting the crispy onion straws that the BBQ burger is known for!  My soup came right as my burger went back to the kitchen, so at least I had something in front of me while the burger was re-fired.  It came back out about 10 minutes later with an apology from the manager and asked me how it was.  I said fine, but the onion straws were just as soggy and gross as they were the first time around.  Luckily they comped my soup and burger, but I was very disappointed and told our server that though the burger itself tasted good, something was definitely up with the onion straws.  She said she told the kitchen that even SHE could see how soggy they were, and that she was told by the kitchen ""there's only so long we can keep them in the fryer""  ?!?!?  Um, excuse me?  At this point my fiance piped in and said that we were CDT's at the Greenville Red Robin, we'd been eating there for years, and that there had never been a problem with the o-straws before.  Our server proceeded to tell us that she'd gotten complaints from other guests about the same thing.  C'mon, corporate!  We're not stupid; we know something is up! Anyway.  That's my gripe.  Like I said, I'll always have a special spot for Red Robin but last night was most disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=40

H L.,"Boston, MA",9,165,,3.0,12/21/2008,"Went for the first time a couple of days ago and thought it was just fine. Like many of the other reviewers have said, this place is truly kid-friendly, which is a huge plus for those who are in need of more places to bring the kiddies. The menu is not necessarily the most diverse, unless you are talking about the burgers which basically can be done in any way you desire. We had the Tower of Onion Rings which were very good but pricey (almost $8 for 13 rings -- man, I could have bought a case of onions for that price). Our burgers were actually very good and not very greasy. The milkshakes also were delicious -- vanilla blueberry was nice. Staff was friendly and our waitress was super efficient and attentive. I probably would stay with burgers and certain appetizers.  I think the only real drawback is that the prices are a little steep for certain items.

Jason T.,"Rockland, MA",9,36,11,3.0,5/4/2009,"I spent the time reading other folks reviews and took them all in stride.  Personally, I love Red Robins... the chain.  I started going to them when I spent the occasional week in Alberta, Canada.  Never had a bad meal up there, went probably 10 times over 3 years.  That being said, I find the Plymouth location, and the Foxboro location for that matter, as hit or miss on customer service and food prep.  I am not saying the food is bad sometimes, but you can definitely tell when they are trying to turn over the tables quick (unmelted cheese on the burgers, quickly prepared sandwiches, etc).  These are relatively new locations and I try to tell myself that the reason they generally ""bite the big one"" on customer service is cause they have a high turnover rate on servers and they are hiring young folks that have lil to no experience.  Yes, this is no excuse, but I go in here knowing this each time. I enjoy their food and their chili is uniquely different.  I don't ever go here expecting a quiet dinner, as folks have earlier pointed out, this tends to be a place to congregate for childrens' birthdays and also the place for a rare sighting of a 6 foot tall red bird which seems to add 100 decibels to the noise in that place. You gotta go here not expecting too much.  Red Robin is what it is... a louder version of Chili's/Fridays with a larger emphasis on burgers. Maybe customer service is just a dead art here in the states, who knows.  Calgary, Alberta, Vancouver, all of those locations were spot on.  Foxboro and Plymouth - good food, poor service.

Eric T.,"Marion, MA",57,247,22,3.0,8/3/2008,"When I worked in Plymouth, I ate here now and then for lunch.  I don't know what the people who trash this place expect when they go to a Red Robin.  I think of it as a Wendy's where you can get a beer.  The cheeseburger parm, is a tasty combo of hamburger, marinara sauce, peppers, onions, and a fried mozzarella wheel.  So disagree with Dylan, it's not a place you want to bring a date, or a customer you're trying to impress, but it's a fine place to bring kids or just have a decent burger and a Miller Lite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=60
Steve G.,"Naples, FL",3,89,,2.0,6/23/2008,"I have been there three times in the past 6 months. Once with wife, once with kids and again with wife.  First time was during the day. Service was fine.

Third time was late, in fact, just before closing. Staff was OK with the obviously last seating of the day. Kitchen was quick to cook for us, even though they were starting to clean up. Waitress was in good mood. No noise. Food was just the way we expected it to be - average burger fare.

Amy C.,"Marshfield, MA",38,206,6,2.0,4/11/2008,"I cracked up when I read Dylan C.'s review of this place. The food really just isn't very good. My very sweet husband went to the RMV with me, and by the time we were done there, we were craving big, juicy burgers, so we figured we'd try out Red Robin. The chicken tortilla soup tasted canned, and the burgers were passable, but kinda greasy, just OK, not really even up to other chain standards. Tons of choices of the OK burgers, and great novelty place for kids *what with the huge, terrifying robin in the front*, but unless the ""unlimited bottomless fries"" deal that accompanies the weak burgers appeals to you, try somewhere else. *You sure ain't gonna be bottomless after unlimited fries, sheesh!!

Crosby N.,"Sagamore Beach, MA",15,12,1,1.0,9/21/2012,"If you don't feel like reading the entire review then the short version is: DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION.  I ordered a ceasar salad, with the dressing on the side, and a side of frys. Not a difficult order, right? And there were hardly any other customers waiting to get food.  After 45+ minutes, with no silverware, my food came out. It was a garden salad with dressing on the side. A garden salad has cucumbers, tomatoes,ice berg lettuce etc. A ceasar salad just has romaine lettuce and some light cheese, that's a huge difference and not what I ordered at all. After recieving the food, I told the waitress it wasn't what I ordered, and instead of apologizing and giving me the correct thing, she told me I could not order a ceasar salad with the dressing on the side, even though its an item listed on the menu, because ""The ceasar salads come premixed, the kitchen can't make one for you with the dressing on the side. I assumed you'd like this just as much""  WHY was this not mentioned before my food came out? Who is this total stranger to assume I would like a totally different meal just as much? Unacceptable. But, it happens, I ignored it. I said ""Well, I'd just like some romaine lettuce in a dish, then"" Which she brought out, but If I can't order a ceasar salad why is it on the menu? When my side of frys finally came out, there were only six in the basket. But I'm not one to complain, so I didn't say anything. I finished my meal, and to help the waitress out, stacked the salad dish on my fry dish. I moved the paper off of the frys, and guess what I saw? Moldy food.  I can only assume they don't wash their plates here. There was dried out cheese, and some kind of moldy batter. I'll attach ALL of the pictures, oh, and I took A LOT pictures.   So not only is this place loud, slow, with unapologetic wait staff, who assume what you want to eat for lunch without asking you, but they're not even up to health code. They would fail, and the restaurant would be shut down, if I was an inspector.  Someone who can do something really should check this place out, it's dirtier than McDonalds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Scott N.,"Fall River, MA",22,51,7,1.0,9/19/2012,"So, I don't give out 1 stars often. Hardly ever, in fact. It's hard for me to find the bad points of a restaurant, mainly because most of the places that I go are just that great! I also try not to review chain restaurants, as they're all mostly the same fare, the differences lie in service. In this case though, neither could be excused. I went here with my girlfriend, just 2 people, and the place was pretty much empty. There were a couple smaller parties around us that had been there for a while, and the table we were sat at was dirty, no silverware, and we didn't see our waitress for 4 or 5 minutes after getting seated. Not too big of a deal, this stuff happens. We had gone around 11:30, so they hadn't been open for too too long prior to our arrival. After the waitress arrived, we just ordered some waters, and she came back with the silverware without our prompt, probably the reason this is even getting 1 star; the waitress did everything she could this visit to make it at least enjoyable. We knew exactly what we wanted: She wanted a Caesar Salad with the dressing on the side, and I wanted the Bleu Ribbon Burger with no onions or tomato, and a separate side of fries for both of us to pick at. It took probably about half an hour for the food to be made, maybe 45 minutes at most, and during this time we never saw the waitress for refills of the water, which we quickly downed in our wait. The food finally came out, and it was wrong. She had received a garden salad with Cesar dressing on the side, and I had tomatoes on my burger. We got the waitresses attention, and she had said ""I assumed you wanted a garden salad with Cesar dressing on the side, because the Cesar salads come pre made."" She just sat there stunned and told the waitress no, she just wants romaine lettuce, with cheese, and dressing on the side. 15 minutes later, the waitress came back with exactly what she had ordered the first time. There were only 5 fries in the basket, which were quickly scarfed down. The meal finished, and something we always do is try to make things better by cleaning off our plates and stacking them. As we were doing so, we took the paper off of one of the baskets, only to find moldy food; batter from an onion ring, cheese and some kind of bread, under the paper. Let me just say that again for impact. Moldy food. Cheese. Batter from leftover food smudged in. We took plenty of pictures for historical reasons, of course.  Immediately disgusted, we called over the manager to explain what happened. She apologized, and went to the kitchen and examined every meal that came out. I am extremely displeased with how our visit went. This wasn't the first time we've found moldy food on dishes, or had to wait +1 hour for our service during slow times. I'm not quite sure what is going on behind the scenes, but I think the management staff needs to re-evaluate how cleaning and food management is done. 1 star. -Slow Service -Dirty Plates w/food still attached -Small side-dish portions  -Incorrect ordering during slow days -Extremely noisy environment -Discourteous staff I will not be returning to this place, and I highly recommend others to stay away. Go to TGI Fridays, Bertucchis, Olive Garden, or Moe's instead, they're all much friendlier, cleaner and better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Jonathan M.,"Brighton, MA",66,12,,3.0,11/6/2013,"In plymouth there are plenty of places to go out. However, if you're on one of those shopping days and need to get a good burger, quick and catch a game. Red Robin in Plymouth is good to go.  I've been a few times and I have to say the highlite everytime was the manager Brian. He picked up I had been there a few times and took care of my party whenever we arrived. Lots of times there was a young bartender or a new server and he always said ""Make sure to take of them, they're regulars."" Whenever we arrived, mind you we had only been there 2-3 times ever.  I learned that Brian isn't at this location anymore after I went in for a beer and a burger. I was by myself and might as well may not have been there at all.

Adam D.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,1.0,9/2/2013,"Consistently horrible. We have gone here on several occasions and there have been a few constants: the wait staff could obviously not care less about you, the orders, or the cleanliness of the place.  Each time the person that has waited on us has disappeared and not been around for long periods of time, only to rush us once they are available. Not only that, when we order they are always out of at least one thing we want..  Then there's the bathroom and overall cleanliness.. My gf took our 1 1/2 yr old to the restroom and had to use wipes to clean the sink counter off and use a blanket in order to change our daughter bc there was fecal matter all over the changing table and that area. It had appeared to have been that way for quite some time and when we notify our server, she said they would send someone over to clean it. However we intentionally watched for someone and saw not one staff member enter the restroom through the course of our meal. Then as we were finally leaving the server said that they had sent someone in to clean (basically lying to our faces).  Oh and the floors in the whole place were so slippery from what is assume was caked on cooking oil condensate mixed with the remnants of water from a feeble attempt at ""mopping"".

The second to last visit we watched our food sit in the window for about 15 minutes and everything was dried out. We asked to speak to the manager and he was quick to comp us three meals on our next visit.  Well we recently had that free visit and I have to say that everything was pretty good so maybe there is hope...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Alyssa D.,"Plympton, MA",7,13,1,1.0,1/3/2015,Went here today for a quick lunch with my kids. The service was ok... We did have to ask for napkins and silverware but at least the staff was nice. Our meals took almost 45 mins to arrive and everything was cold. The burgers were thin and the buns were greasy. I ordered mushrooms on my burger and they weren't even cooked! My son had Mac and cheese from the kids menu and the noodles were still hard. I guess they weren't microwaved long enough? We barely touched our burgers and decided to fill up on the bottomless fries. I didn't complain because I knew that we would never go back there anyway. The whole meal costs 40 dollars. I think that is a bit steep for 2 burgers and a kids meal. I will go to Friday's next time we are in that area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Karen G.,"Plainville, CT",0,1,,3.0,12/10/2014,"I've been to several Red Robins throughout  New England. I've  been happy with them all, with the exception of the Red Robin in Plymouth, Ma. I am gluten free and its a treat to go out and eat a cheeseburger with a gluten free roll. The roll I received tonight with my burger was ice cold,which made my burger cold and my roll just crumbled in my hands The best Red Robin Cheeseburger I've had to date is the one near Gillette Stadium. There they served my cheeseburger on a buttered toasted bun...I can still taste it today Hopefully, the next time I eat at a Red Robins my experience will be better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20

I gave it 4 stars it's not the best burger I ever had but it is the best I've ever had from a chain. The service was good and the burgers are tasty.

Michelle M.,"Plymouth, MA",25,13,1,1.0,11/4/2015,Terrible..  Not sure why this place is always busy.  How hard is it to cook a burger?  Last time I was there I had to send my food back twice because the burger was on the rare side.  Will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20

Dan G.,"Winthrop, MA",260,984,32,3.0,2/18/2010,"I came here for the first time, mainly for the bottomless fries, which apparently have a bottom! I guess its good because I don't need more but I wanted more! I like the decor, its fun and seems like a place you could bring kids, and the creepy red robin mascot was coming around which was...interesting. The food was really good. I mean not top notch but it was good for a chain. I had a chicken bruschetta burger and yummmmmm. I would get it again. The service was ....very.....very.....s....l...o....w. Probably because they are understaffed, but thats not my fault dammit. So anyways we had to ask a few times for one of the drinks and they NEVER come back to your table so you can get more fries which are delicious. I was kinda pissy about this part because they advertise but don't deliver. Everything is about $9-12 and they have a wide variety of burgers...mmmmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Paul S.,"East Bridgewater, MA",10,1,,2.0,10/18/2015,We asked hostess if we could have a booth because it is easier too contain 3 little ones.

Leon L.,"Boston, MA",12,94,1107,4.0,5/14/2012,"Not all chain locations are the same.  I have been to a few Red Robins in the area.  I must say that this place does a better job with their food than some of the other locations.  Burgers and fries are done right.  Servers are friendly.  This is a good stop for people visiting the Plymouth area. The do some promotions on burgers from time to time.  I like trying new variations of burgers, but try the Teriyaki burger.  That is a good choice. Never a disappointment here.  Would come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Becky B.,"Marshfield, MA",75,196,118,3.0,5/23/2010,"Red Robin is known for it's expansive burger selection, as well as never-ending fries and soda. but I don't think I've read anything about how they're well known for their good wait staff. While I thought the food was pretty good (they've added more items to the menu including wraps and other types of sandwiches) the service was seriously lacking. Our waiter was Corey. He was not outright nasty or anything but he wasn''t exactly friendly either. He seemed to lack any personality whatoever--it's more important than you think--especially if you're bringing special needs students there for lunch. You need someone friendly and understanding. He also was slow and seemed to be a little on the clueless side.  I don't eat at Red Robin very often and I don't really plan on going back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20

Devon D.,"Taunton, MA",0,4,,1.0,4/25/2014,"I have never been more disgusted by the burger I had. For one- I chose one of their specialty burgers that was 12.99, should be good right? Especially since it was called ""D.G.B- Damn Good Burger"" WRONG. The entire bottom bun was entirely drenched in grease to the point where it was impossible to hold- disgusting. Secondly- I ordered a medium rare burger and the burger was SO well done it was actually hard to chew. I have never been the type of person to send anything back- but I can guarantee I will never go to a Red Robin again for as long as I live.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20
Sam K.,"Plymouth, MA",2,119,7,2.0,8/12/2013,Went their once and it was alright.  I didn't care much for the menu and the never ending fries did nothing for me as you get a basket that you chew down in less than 3 minutes and have to wait 10 minutes to ask for more.   the burger was ordinary nothing special.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20

Bill D.,"Hanover, MA",1,12,,2.0,2/18/2017,"This Red Robin location has been open about 10 years and unfortunately the bloom is off the rose. Once seated the up selling begins: a drink from the bar, some appetizers, etc. all before looking at a menu. The table kiosks once offered its trivia games for free; now it's $1.99.  Ordering a Black and Bleu Burger, I got what amounted to a 4 ounce (at best) burger for $14.49. The toppings amounted to more substance than did the beef. Red Robin touts its bottomless fries policy and until recently at this location that included offering fries while waiting for one's meal. When I mentioned this fact to the waitress the up selling continued with her offering an order of fries for $1.99!. Other RR locations here and in Florida still offer the pre-meal bottomless fries offering. While our waitress took our order in a timely manner, it took 25 minutes for the burgers to arrive. The burger didn't have much taste of either beef or blue cheese and the fries were over salted. The men's room needed a good cleaning, what with a clogged urinal and generally unclean facilities. And a message to management: even MacDonald's, Wendys and Burger King have WI-Fi! Not here though. It's not all bad, though. Joining the rewards program nets you a free birthday burger, preferably at another RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth

Sean C.,"Carver, MA",0,44,,1.0,10/19/2017,"This place is going downhill. They don't give kids balloons anymore which, while simple, was a really big deal to my kids. I suppose in the age of virtual reality and social media, most other kids don't care. The fries used to have yummy seasoning on them but don't anymore. They put the seasoning on the table but it doesn't stick to the fries once they start to cool. It's best to season them as soon as they come out of the fryer. Now, I'm on a diet but my 4 year old daughter really wanted to come here for her birthday so I obliged. I ordered the salmon entree. However, it first came out as a sandwich. They took it back into the kitchen to fix it, which consisted of them sliding the salmon off the bun onto the plate. It was disgusting. A thin piece of dry overcooked salmon with overcooked broccoli, some of which was yellow. All this for $15. The server never asked how we liked our food. I think the underwhelming look on my face was enough to make her think twice. We're done with Red Robin. I need to be able to eat healthy when I want to and actually enjoy it. There's plenty of other places where my growing kids can indulge while I get something sensible but delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth

Sat at a high top in the bar and waited .... and waited ....and, well, you get the picture.  I  knew it was going to be bad when the male bartender was loudly exclaiming to apparently nobody who cared how he had already been there way too long that day and is brain dead.  I wanted to leave but my boyfriend was starving.  Exhausted bartender finally made his way over.  He was disheveled, loud and annoying.  I asked for a diet coke with lemon. 15 minutes later I got a regular coke, with no ice, and no lemon. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and my bf got a burger.  Overworked bartender must have fallen asleep behind the bar because he never came back.  Food kept coming out of the kitchen by confused food runners who knew nothing about where said food should be going.  They would stand there dumb as a stump yelling ""whose got the clamdigger chowda""?! A nice couple sat next to us and we warned ""don't stay"".  Anyway, my soup was inedible. Presentation horrible, spilled over sides, not because it was full, because the food runner had the shakes.  Lukewarm, minimal chicken, no sour cream dollop.  My bf's burger was a mess to eat, but alright, but then again, he was starving.  I will never step foot in this place again.  I can't imagine how they are still in business.  Paying the check was another ordeal.  Nobody came to give us a bill, so we used the intrusive machine on the table.  That part was easy but then I realized there was a charge for it.   NEVER AGAIN!  Red Robin should be Dead Robin.
