If you wish to have a lighter meal, get the $10 deal for just an entree plus starter OR dessert.  The best combo i love is Fried Mozzarella + Parmesan Flounder + Reese's BP Pie!  The melted cheese is so mooey gooey and i just cant stop popping 'em fried goodies into my mouth!

71,Amy L.,"Lafayette, LA",34,74,35.0,4.0,2012-09-02,"First of all, let me relay a conversation I had with the hostess on my most recent visit because, well, I think I am hilarious but the hostess didn't seem to agree.. Hostess: How are y'all? Me: Good. You? Hostess: I'm ready for Friday. Me: In here, isn't it always Friday? ::crickets chirping in the silence:: I know that is goes against all my instincts to love a chain restaurant but I can't fight my infatuation with Fridays.  The obsession is rooted in the Jack Daniels BBQ glaze. I ask for at least 3 sides of it not matter what meal I have ordered.  It goes well with EVERYTHING!  I also love their 3 for $12 deal.  If you are splitting the meal with a friend it makes this restaurant pretty affordable.  Otherwise, most dishes run between $10 and $15 which is a little steep for my taste. Parmesan crusted chicken, Jack Daniel flat iron steak, Oreo Madness, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, sweet potato fries...I can't help myself.  Fridays is my foodie guilty pleasure. Drink prices can be a little steep so I usually try to order whatever cocktail is on special for the month (located inside the front drink cover).  Service is usually decent.  They lose 1 star for not having a regular happy hour for those of us that don't want to sit in the smokey bar section.  If they amended this, we would probably go back to having our weekly happy hour at TGI Fridays.  Until then, we will stick with practically free Chuys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32
69,Shanitra M.,"Houston, TX",0,41,2.0,2.0,2012-09-03,"We just ate there this evening. We were actually going back to Antonios to eat dinner but they were closed today :-(.  First of all when we walked in, the three girls up front were giggling and talking and did not even notice that we came inside. They normally open the door to greet you but not today. It was as though we interrupted them from their conversation. One girl said ""oh, we did not notice you"" They then assumed we were with the couple that came in the door after us. Anyway I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and my husband ordered a steak and ribs plate. The corn was hard and the bbq sauce was gross. I requested that my burger be cooked well done with bacon and our server asked if i wanted pickled onion lettuce tomato. I told her i wanted pickle and onions. There was one single tiny onion on the burger and no pickles. I asked for ketchup because their was none on our table so she grabbed the empty bottle from the table across from us. I also asked for mustard and my husband asked for water., She brought them to the table and said ""mustard"" ""water"" with an attitude as though it was an inconvenience.  the burger was bland, it had lots of grill marks on it that were perfectly even so it is obvious that they buy the burger with the marks on it. No flavor. Dessert wasnt great.. an oreo ice cream desert and a brownie with ice cream. The brownie was burning hot  and extremely soft- i believe it was microwaved for too long.  Jessica was our server, not friendly at all. I love Fridays, but not impressed at all with this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

This place looked pretty much new so it was very clean inside and out. We sat in bar seating area and was quickly told they allow smoking in there after 2 pm. Since it was 12 noon we were fine, so we order our drinks and food off the menu.  I decided to have the chicken fingers and they were not bad.  It is kind of hard to screw up chicken fingers but I have seen it done.  Our server aka bartender kept our drinks full and provided us with great service. I enjoyed staring at all his flare. It kind of reminder of Office Space.  Well we had a good experience here and got back on the road back to Austin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252
49,Elaine W.,"Katy, TX",890,127,2.0,1.0,2013-05-20,"What happened to the good 'ole days when TGIF was actually an awesome place to have dinner & drinks? Had dinner here over the weekend & sadly we were in utter disbelief on how bad the food was. After looking over the extensive dinner menu we decided to start off with loaded potatoes skins, fried mozzarella & boneless buffalo wings as an appetizer. Let me tell ya there was absolutely nothing loaded about the these potato skins. They looked like pieces of flat bread with melted cheese and a whole lot of sour cream. The mozzarella sticks were also deflated & served cold. The wings and celery sticks were honestly the best part of the entire appetizer.  Moving on, to the dinner portion of the meal. The pictures on the menu looked really good so we ordered from the Jack Daniels selection. Ohh man, was that another mistake. I ordered the JD grilled salmon and choose mashed potatoes and rice pilaf as my two sides. The salmon was flavorless and dry, dry, dry! Half of it stuck on the piping hot skillet it was served on. They gave me one scoop of mashed potatoes, the presentation looked like something you would get in prison. The rice pilaf was nothing more than old white rice with some dill mixed into it, that too was all stuck to the skillet. It was just soooo horrible. The best part of this $16 meal was the Jack Daniels sauce they served on the side. My husband ordered the JD grilled chicken & fried shrimp meal and again we couldn't believe what we were seeing before our eyes. An extra small dry and flavorless chicken breast served with dry zucchini and once again that unappealing scoop of mashed potatoes. The prices were outrageous and portions ridiculous. We left there paying $76 dollars. We felt robbed & sadly for me I had to come home and cook dinner after an hour or so. Stay far, far away from this place! $76 bucks is a lot of money to be wasted & disappointed when going out. Next time I'll buy 3 pounds of fresh salmon, chicken & shrimp and grill them all to perfection and have plenty of leftovers, thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=60,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

Then they got the orders wrong, my husbands chicken was dried out. they also just plain forgot someones meal competely.

I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the nastiest lemonade I have ever tasted and I am a lemonade lover. It is usually what I order in any restaurant. It was so sour it was unbearable. This lemonade just killed out whole experience their. I think it killed my taste buds because after the drink everything just seemed to taste bland.

56,Josh C.,"Richmond, TX",96,15,,2.0,2014-05-19,"Keeping in mind that this was a Monday evening, and simply not that busy, here is my review. I will not be going back. UNPROFESSIONAL. We were seated, with our three small children, in a busy intersection of the restaurant, so we took the liberty of moving 8 feet away for a more secluded table. When we saw the girl who seated us coming back with the high chair and booster seat, I said from a distance that we preferred to sit at this other table. The girl appeared to look at her friend and roll her eyes. SLOW. After sitting for about 6 minutes waiting for any type of contact from our server, the same girl who seated us came over and said that our server would be with us soon... Another 4 minutes, and he actually did come. It took 5 minutes to get three waters and another 3 or 4 minutes to get the two fountain drinks ordered at the same time. The waiter disappeared for 5-7 minutes twice before taking our food order, and after taking the order, we waited at least 20 minutes for the food to come. Then, he disappeared for 15 minutes, and I had to hunt him down, actually asking another server to tell him we needed our check. After waiting 5-6 more minutes for our check, I had to go to the bar area and find the dude. There I found him and two other employees huddled around the computer trying to figure out how to enter a coupon into the system. FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE. We had the Chicken and Shrimp Cajun Pasta, a full rack of baby back ribs, and a kids order of macaroni and cheese. The fries that came with the ribs and the cold and soggy, the ribs were dry and, at best bland, at worst, somewhat pasty tasting. i don't know how else to explain it. The cajun pasta was blah, not bad, but not good. Too hot, not flavorful enough. Two shrimp in the entire plate, not much more chicken.

Its fun but not obnoxious, social but not club-like, and there are regulars who are friendly but not cliquish or overt. The bar area serves full menu at the tables and the bar.

My wife and I went during lunch on a Friday and it was pretty much dead yet we still had to wait for the nonexistent host to seat us. After about 5 minutes we just went and sat at the bar which was gross so we sat at the cleanest table we could find. Roughly 25 minutes later an awkward and overworked bartender came over and asked us for drink orders. I asked for a rebel IPA and she got a margarita. The beer was flat and tasted like the tap hadn't been cleaned in months. I asked for a bottled beer instead. The bartender poured that into a dirty glass with a black sticky substance on the inside that got into my beer. We quickly stood up left our drinks on the bar and told the girl we were leaving.

The chicken and waffles caught my attention, right away...to make up for my ""go to"" place having taken it off of the menu. First off, the service we received was splendid. I can't recall the lady's name, but she had a very pleasant attitude, acted if she wanted to serve us, and was very informative - without being asked - when it came to the menu. Her cordiality made us want to stay for a while, which is hardly ever the case when we go to restaurants.  At any rate, the bulk of the order, between my girlfriend, my kiddo, and myself was...wait for it...wait for it...Chicken and Waffles! It came with chipotle maple syrup, which she described as having just a little kick and she opted to just give the kiddo the plain maple syrup, as a precaution.  When the food landed...the chicken strip, on top of the waffle, were prepared with my kind of fried. And when we added the chipotle maple syrup...Sirens! Sirens, baby! Not for it being hot and spicy, but for the blowing of one's mind. Very nice, TGI Friday's. Very nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.352,2.36

A group if 7 of us came in around 10pm, which is well before the restaurant closes (which is at midnight), so there was no excuse of why the service was so bad. The waiter DJ served us and was helpful at first until we were ready to order. Then he didn't appear for 20 minutes, we had to ask another waiter where he was because we told him just 5 more minutes.... Anyways, he didnt even bring us our food, the other waiter did. All DJ did was take our order and that was pretty much it. When we went to pay, he had our cards for about 20 more minutes. I told my friends to check their bank accounts and one of them was charged 3 times for all of our checks that were split..... Then another was charged for two of the checks combined together and then her original check. So they were both overcharged 86 dollars!!! Then the best part is, he failed to even mention what happened, and the manager came up and said that it will be dropped..... They were gonna pretend like nothing happened.  Hands down worse service.

This restaurant was not busy at all for a Friday night there was no reason we had to wait 30 minutes almost just to get our tickets we would ask for drinks it would take him 10 minutes or more to bring them to us absolutely ridiculous and the manager was not any help at all!!!

(Also, this is a smoking bar, eww) There was no wait, yet it took our server about 5 mins to come greet us. We sat in a section where one other family sat, the floors were filthy. The tables had been re-set, yet no one thought to sweep under them. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before eating and one stall is out of order, the sinks are stopped up, trash coming out of the sanitary bins on the floor. No soap in one dispenser. I was actually in there with the host, and she saw the soap dispenser empty but decided to mind her business. Ok cool. My boyfriend went into the men's room, and reported the same exact conditions, especially with the sinks. Couldn't convince him to take pics haha.  Food: got it quickly, but my food was not hot. My steak was overcooked but I was scared to send it back. Our server was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. My son had an empty cup almost the entire time we were there but was never offered a refill. In fact, he only checked on us like twice, once after we had asked for more napkins. My husband actually got up and got them from the bar, when we mentioned this to the server, his reply was ""oh"". Nice. I did not finish my food, nor did I take it home. My son would not touch his sliders. We are actually fans of TGIF, but will never be back to this location. It left a bad taste in our mouths, literally. Also, there were several servers standing around watching the game instead of cleaning up an obvious mess. There was no manager to be seen, and even if he/she was there they must be been blind to not see this crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

However, I went with a group of friends to visit our friend Amy, who is a hostess at this location. I ordered the Bourbon Barrel chicken and had steamed broccoli and their tomato and mozarella salad as my two sides. Which by the way, comes in at less than 500 calories for the entire meal. Score! Everything tasted fantastic and I'm quite pleased that TGIF has some healthier, lower cal menu items to choose from. Our waitress was also incredibly sweet.  I took a star away though because the menus were disgusting- dried on food and beverage stains on every single one. Bleh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

The first thing we encounter when we walk through door is the hostess greets us with a look, then tells us to wait because she has to find a table but we have to go sit in the waiting area and not stand by the door. We wait for a clean table but to my surprise, the table we were seated at was quite dirty and was only swept where you could see.....ok that's gross.  So we proceed to order from our waitress, who actually tries to walk away without taking all of the orders and is not very communicative or pays very much attention to anything. The food takes over an hour to prepare, we never receive any drink refills or even a ""how is everyone doing"".  Once we receive our food, half of it is prepared incorrectly and unfinished.  The waitress comes to the table a total of 4 times throughout the God awful 2 1/2 hour time frame we were there, and then the ticket actually suggests an 18% tip...yeah, not gonna happen.  Don't waste your time or money, neither are worth it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

We ordered normal food off the menu and then the waiting started... it took about 10 minutes for our water to show up but only for some of us. Then we asked for our teas we had ordered and about 15 minutes later we asked again. About 45 minutes in our server said our food was coming. After an hour she said it was coming again. Finally the tea showed up (unsweet iced tea). At the 1 and a half mark the food came out - incorrect and only for some of us, burnt and cold. Another 15 minutes and a manager showed up saying oh - those two entrees you are waiting for were burnt and we threw them out but the reorder is almost ready.

And things went even further south from that point. We ordered the highly publicized endless apps and were very excited.when our potato skins & boneless buffalo wins come they looked old and clearly reheated. We asked for small plates to eat off of but when they didn't show we dig in. But just when you take that first bite you are shocked to have a like warm skin and cold wing. We were so hungry we kept eating but when our second round of cheese sticks and quesadilla showed up with again still no plates I couldn't go pas one. If I wanted to eat Luke warm and obviously reheated food I would have hit the freezer section and kroger and gone home. When my salad and soup showed the disappointment continued. My soup was so cold I sent it back and the server said he would microwave it to make it hotter! MICROWAVE IT!!! Why is it not hot to start? The ranch on my salad tasted sour so I was then done with it all. My husband got a burger and ordered it medium. When he was finished she then said that was a well done burger but  he was so hungry he didn't want to wait for a new one to come out so he went with it. We told the server how disappointed we were with the food and he said he didn't cook it so he was sorry. Then about 30 minutes after leaving my husband and I were sick for the rest of the night.
