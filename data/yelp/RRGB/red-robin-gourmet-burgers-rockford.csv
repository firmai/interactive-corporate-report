Timothy S.,"Madison, WI",15,446,,5.0,10/21/2016,"Five stars because the whole restaurant has been changed up in some very positive ways.   It is obvious that the management is listening to what people want and don't want. I haven't been in a RR in over a year and I was pleased to see all the clutter of framed pictures and ""flare"" removed from the walls and replaced with nicely placed and spaced accents.    I asked about the changes from our very pleasant and excellent waitress who informed us of how they have changed the whole layout and what the thinking was behind the changes.  There is a new menu, a lower noise level and the whole place is more welcoming to my tastes. My meal in particular used to be a favorite but the last time I got it it was lousy.   I decided to try it again, the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad.  Wow!  The presentation was excellent and it was delicious.  It was such a pleasant surprise to see these great improvements and I look forward to my next visit to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford
Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1939,478,1562,2.0,12/8/2017,"The burger and fries were average.  The burger was on the small size and only about 12 french fries were served on the plate.  Yes, you can order more fires, but to only serve 12 fries is not good.  Then they use those stupid Ziosk Kiosks.  I hate those things, especially at Red Robin because they don't work.  You need the waitress to punch the buttons to check out.  Crazy, cumbersome, and difficult system and not customer centric.

Rainy D.,"Oak Creek, WI",26,24,,5.0,6/30/2016,"On 6/29 we came to Red Robin after getting ignored at Applebee's while freezing. We walked into Red Robin about 15 minutes before closing. We were immediately greeted by a very nice hostess and we're sat at a table in the bar. Mike, the bartender, offered us drinks right away...which were delicious. Even though Mike was working on his closing duties, our service was still awesome. The food came out hot and on time. The BBQ wings were better than expected. Mike was very knowledgeable, he knows what he's doing. We're both bartenders and we're very impressed with his attitude, service, knowledge and orginzation.

Leah O.,"Rockford, IL",32,79,51,2.0,5/14/2016,"*Bleeeech* Ugh, that was the sound of my stomach today after eating here. And it's not a happy sound.  We arrived and were told there would be a 30 minute wait. After about ten minutes the server surprisingly called us back. Then told us to sit back down because there had been a mistake, then immediately told us to get back up because she fixed it (although, she was very nice about it). What is this, Simon says?? I ordered a cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese and some of their bottomless sweet potato fries. The food came out relatively fast which is why when I bit into my cold pink burger I was a bit surprised. It couldn't have sat out a long time. I chose not to say anything as I was completely famished and the risk of E. Coli seemed worth it in the moment. None of my other eating companions had this complaint. Although my husband's tea was disappointingly watered down.  I would be hesitant to come back here. The two stars are for our server who was really nice.

Tripp A.,"Machesney Park, IL",0,19,15,2.0,8/5/2016,"Based on service and food I would give this place a four, sometimes a five. But they have the world's most dysfunctional loyalty program reducing to 3-stars.  Today I literally had to reconcile my past Red Robin visits using my credit card company app to prove to them how many times I have actually eaten there. That's because your manager essentially accused me of trying to defraud Red Robin one extra point worth what...70-cents????  The loyalty program fails to register every visit. The loyalty program has never worked with my telephone number meaning I have to search through 2-dozen spam emails from red robin to give them the actual long account number. Program not good at every store. Program not good in Texas or Alaska. Loyalty program not good in downtown Chicago. Lost my free birthday lunch because I ate there on a business expense account and they forced me to take my free birthday lunch essentially giving it to my employer. Hassles dealing with corporate toll-free number and website. Despite all of these problems your manager told me that it is a great loyalty program and these problems are all mine. So we know the customer is always wrong!!  A loyalty program should create loyal fans. I would be a fan of red Robin except for the fact I hate your loyalty program due to all the hassle.  Your three stars gets reduced to two due to no wifi...I have to burn my data plan sitting in your restaurant because you want to ""turn tables faster.""  Again, nice customer service attitude! 4 or 5 stars based on food and service...2 stars based on management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=20

The fries are hot and fresh! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside! The waiters/waitresses have always brought me my burgers within a reasonable time exactly how I ordered them.

James R.,"Rockford, IL",100,342,289,3.0,5/9/2011,"On Friday I was in the mood for a burger and because I was in the thralls of a Cinco De Mayo day after effect, I couldn't think of a non-fast food joint to get one. This was the first place that popped into my head to get a burger.  Our server came over and was very attentive. She took our order for drinks and gave us time to look over the menu. Their menu has a large selection of differently dressed up burgers. From a plain cheeseburger to some really unusual combinations. I ended up ordering a Bleu Ribbon burger and my wife ordered the Guacamole and Bacon burger.  I was a little put off when the waitress took our order and asked if I wanted some pink or no pink on my burger. I'm used to be asked how I like it based on the standard vernacular of Rare to Well Done. (or as one of my friends likes it, ""Charcoled"") I know that is the way the company tells her to ask, so I'm not upset with her, but to me it seemed like I was being treated like a child.  When the food came, these burgers were huge! It was hard to eat because I couldn't open my mouth wide enough to take a bite. So I had to really squish it into a more compact burger. I really didn't enjoy my burger. I knew exactly what I was ordering, I've had burgers with bleu cheese on it at other places and I generally like them. This time, I did not. The bleu cheese itself was fine, but I'm not sure if it was the sauce they used, or the shoestring onion rings on it or what, but it just tasted off. The flavor combination was unappetizing and I was only able to eat about half my burger.  My wife on the other hand loved her burger. The quac and bacon combined to make her burger something different and delicious. She let me take a bite and I'll tell you I had wished I ordered that burger over mine. Even though it was good, I will tell you that neither of these burgers was worth the $10 price tag on them.  I would eat here again, but honestly I think I'd find a local restaurant that has a good burger first if I had the choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=20

It's frustrating going to a chain restaurant and knowing what to expect and receiving much less than what you expect.  That's what happened to me last Saturday night.  We came here because my sister's birthday, and left somewhat disappointed! The actual food was REALLY good...you know, once we actually got it. Dustin came over to take our drink orders, and asked if we would like any appetizers.  My sister said no, but we would like a basket of fries to start us out!  We NEVER saw that basket of fries.  I don't even think he realizes it to this day... But we all ordered something different, and I ordered an extra side salad.  I asked for it before the meal, and it did come out before...about 8 seconds before.  Thanks...  And I had specified that I wanted both the salad AND the fries, and my buger looked really sad sitting there in the tray all by itself.  He even realized this and said ""oh I forgot your fries"" and proceeded to come out to our table a couple more times before he actually brought me any fries.  Lame... But my turkey burger--meh--too salty! The fries (once I actually got some, good) salad-good Gingerbread milkshake--amazing!!  and I like how they bring it out to you in the glass and give you the extra as well! So there were a lot of annoyances, but the biggest thing was, nobody EVER cleared off our table.  We ran out of room on the table because throughout the meal, we needed to stack and stack and stack everything.  I would get a refill on my drink, and get a new glass and he would never take the old one away.  I finished my salad, and the bowl sat there for the rest of the meal.  It might not seem like a big deal, but when you multiply all of the glasses and the trays by 7, it becomes a big problem fast.  A problem Dustin didn't seem to notice/care about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=20

You have two choices here: overcooked and way-overcooked (they call it pink and well-done). But fear not rare meat eaters. If you must go here skip the burgers and order something else. Their turkey burgers are actually really juicy and delicious -- and the chili I had was one of the best I've ever had thanks to the slow cooked and roasted poblano peppers that gave it a deep warmth without any ""hot without taste"" nonsense.

The server should have told me that she made the error not ignore it like nothing was wrong. I was unable to get presents because of this happening. Very unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40
Matt D.,"Mount Morris, IL",62,11,,4.0,10/26/2012,Food is pretty.  Service is often slow and the decor is a little kitschy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40
Jack A.,"Beloit, WI",0,6,1,1.0,2/9/2015,"Have been a customer for years of the one in Janesville WI and have always had great experiences.  However happened to be in Rockford, Il for my daughter's birthday and of all the places to choose to eat she wanted to eat at this Red Robin. We had to wait 45 minutes to get a table which was understandable as it was a Saturday night. When we got a table and ordered appetizers, their wings were cold. Then when dinner came all of our meals came out except for my daughter's.  The waitress claimed the cooks forgot her meal. She didn't get her meal for about 15 minutes after we received ours which by that time we were all just about done eating our meals. When i complained to management they claimed that the waitress not the cooks forgot.  At the end of the meal they overcharged me for drinks by a crazy $15 then after pointing out the error they messed the check up again twice more. Was the worse dining experience ever and will never step foot in that place again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40
Harvey L.,"Dakota, IL",0,4,3,3.0,1/24/2014,"My wife and I went here on a whim for lunch around noon. Upon entering we were greeted by a less than excited male host and were taken to our table near the rest room, not a Problem because I had to go when we got there. Our waitress Tina was polite and eager to make suggestions. She suggested pretzel bits for an appetizer. I was not as impressed with them as Tina was. I mean ..they were little bits of warm pretzel with a little cup of cheese sauce. Not really worth what they charged. The smoke house burger I got  and had upgraded to ""monster"" on Tina's suggestion was AWSOME!!!!  It was just that monster sized oh yeah. The burger was a bit too juicy as it dripped all over the  plate. That is the only bitch I have about the food. I was also introduced to another foreign concept bottomless fries. Tina's service was pretty good my wife went through two lemonande's and I never even saw Tina switch out the glasses. She came by and checked on us enough to be attentive but not bothersome. My wife also enjoyed her garden burger which she described as good enough to not know she was eating a garden burger. The bill was high for what we had almost fifty dollars for two sandwiches a lemonade and an ice tea  oh and the ""pretzel bits"". All in all not terrible but not great either. Would have rated higher if the bill was more reasonable and if they had wifi for customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40
Kelly R.,"Madison, WI",37,173,14,2.0,9/28/2009,"Stopped in for lunch on my way back to Wisconsin...I have no idea why. I'd been to a Red Robin once before and was underwhelmed, but it was right off of the road, and I was super hungry. I was seated at a small, half-size booth right by the kitchen, to my dismay. I absolutely hate that restaurants do this. The last thing I want to hear is the kitchen and waitstaff and complaining and swapping weekend anecdotes.  The waiter was nice, and attentive...almost too attentive. He came to get my drink order within seconds of being seated. I knew that RR has some funky different beverages, so I told him to come back in a few. I decided on the Peachy Keen--a mix of sprite, peach flavor, and diced peaches. My drink was pretty, but I was horrified when I took a first sip, and was greeted with a mouthful of peach drink syrup. The drink wasn't mixed, and all of the flavor was on the bottom.Not to mention the fact that my ""diced peaches"" were just that. Out of a can, Del Monte style.  Ewww.  ""Waiter, can I get a water???"" I also was unimpressed by my burger. I just went with a classic standard Cheeseburger. It looked tasty, if a bit mammoth. Once I unhinged my jaw to fit the colossal sandwich, I received a punch in the face(okay, in my tastebuds)  every time I took a bite. Not a good one. I don't know if it was the ketchup or the relish, but SOMETHING was so strongly vinegar tasting and just downright caustic, that I literally choked on the fumes when I brought the burger up to my mouth. Hmm. I took off that side of the bun and just ate it with a fork.  Not exactly the best ""gourmet burger"" I've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40
Carol D.,"Gladstone, IL",0,10,,2.0,4/27/2012,Very noisy!  Dinner was slow in coming and some of the fries in our group of 7 were cold.  Cole slaw was bland almost like no dressing at all.  Riblets were good Prime Rib sandwich was not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=40

Raymond B.,"San Antonio, TX",56,154,98,3.0,1/4/2011,"It's a red robin. Reliably tasty food, good service, random junk all over the walls, TV's to distract, and decent pricing.
