0,Kimberly T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,43,1.0,1.0,2012-05-15,"Gave a few try's but in last few years quality seriously went down then the wait staff became rude, have spoke about this w many other ppl who use to frequent. I have gift cards I won't  even use there n don't wanna insult ppl by giving them one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3?start=20,,,,,
1,Deven G.,"Free Union, VA",0,9,,1.0,2013-01-14,"Our expectations were appropriate for the establishment and  yet they still managed to disappoint HUGELY!  Service was appallingly bad - the servers were more interested in socializing with each other and friends that stopped in then attending to their clients.  The food: atrocious. My half rack of ribs must have come from a miniature pot belly pig and was accompanied by pale, undercooked fries. We asked to split the check down the middle which resulted in a 35 minute nightmare. The check was split by food - single appetizer on one check ($13), 2 entrees on the other ($29)?????? Correcting that absurdity literally took 25 minutes to resolve with repeated tripsto the cash register by us begging the return of our cards so we could just get out of there and square up amongst ourselves. Can't see myself ever going to an Applebee's anywhere ever again.  Whoever runs this place is in the wrong business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3?start=20,,,,,
20,Arthur M.,"Shenandoah, VA",0,34,5.0,3.0,2013-03-27,Nothing special. Just great Applebee's food. Love the triple sampler. Friendly atmosphere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
19,Elizabeth M.,"Newport News, VA",7,5,,2.0,2013-07-13,"Husband's food was fine, nice and hot. I had the chicken penna pasta and it came out cold. Son's Mac and cheese was like Kraft and it sat under the hot light so long the pasta was a dark yellow on the top.

21,Josh G.,"Charlottesville, VA",1,13,1.0,2.0,2013-10-25,"This location has had great servers in the past, but we've gone twice this past year with consistently bad service. Rarely does anyone check on you and sometimes they forget to key in items that you ordered. The prices seem to have risen, but the service should match. I doubt I will be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
16,Debbie W.,"Stuarts Draft, VA",0,2,,1.0,2014-11-13,"Service is terrible. Food, not what it used to be. Really going down hill. Will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
17,Kari W.,"Chesterfield, VA",57,133,159.0,3.0,2014-11-17,"Came here for lunch with my family. We had great service here and the standard as far as Applebee's food goes. It was hot when it came out and everyone's order was right. I got the fiesta lime chicken & it was really tasty! We got honey BBQ wings for an appetizer and they were covered in yummy sauce, hint and fresh when they arrived. They also given you a huge portion of wings for an appetizer. Everyone else was happy with the food and if we come this way again we would definitely come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
6,Serenity N.,"Waynesboro, VA",13,44,32.0,3.0,2015-06-16,"This is a restaurant chain, so it isn't something for the Foodies wanting locally sourced ingredients & fancy dishes made from scratch, served in an eclectic unique environment.  That said, sometimes you just want to eat out & not get too serious about it, you know what I mean?  This is a place to bring the family where everybody can find something on the menu that will probably float their boat, with the restaurant being pleasantly-sized & not a tiny fish bowl.  One of my gripes with many local restaurants is how tiny they are.  I don't like feeling like I'm in a fish bowl being gawked at while I eat, lol.   We have had many pleasant experiences here, with nice & attentive wait staff, & good food.  We have tried several dishes, with favs being their french onion soup (if I add salt), & their spinach artichoke dip (yum!), & their pasta dishes are pretty flavorful, too.  We learned a tip from another patron who said to ask for an extra little tub of your fav sauce on the side, if you prefer it more saucy.  Everybody has different tastes, and while some people prefer lightly sauced pasta, others want it juiced-up.  I prefer to ask for the sauce ahead of time & have it handy just in case, while the food is still hot & I don't have to risk the waitress being too busy to return with it fast enough. All in all, when we aren't in a fussy mood & just want to eat & run instead of making a special event out of it, this is a frequent go-to place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
18,The B.,"Waynesboro, VA",13,9,,3.0,2015-06-17,The service was good very good waiter but I really didn't like the taste of their steak. I've had better. With a whole bunch of steak restaurants around Applebee's you would think that they what up their game,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
12,Scott V.,"Bradenton, FL",1,60,16.0,2.0,2015-08-02,"Atmosphere was okay, didn't expect good karaoke but we were just passing through town.  Service was excellent, our server (wish we could remember his name) was on top of his game.  But the steak I had was about 50% grizzle throughout.  Too tired and too hungry to send it back but regretted eating it later.... trust me.  Fully loaded mashed potatoes usually means the stuff is mixed in, not just tossed on top.  At least is has been everywhere else.  Drinks were good, but we have eaten at good Applebee's and at bad ones, this was great service, terrible food. The nearby hotel followed suit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
2,T W.,"Fishersville, VA",21,17,24.0,2.0,2015-10-03,"I don't know where to start really.  I like the atmosphere of this place. It looks like a place at which I would enjoy eating and drinking.  But every time I leave I feel like I didn't get my money's worth. The food is bland and seems like it is microwaved rather than cooked.  Many of the items have too much salt for my taste.  On the positive side, they have started carrying microbrews instead of the big conglomerate massed produced beer (swill) that they used to exclusively carry.  Anyway, it's not someplace I would choose to go on my own. I'd only consider going if strong-armed by the family. Or if someone else is paying! BTW, I have no issue with folks that work there as the service people are always friendly and fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
13,Garrett H.,"Waynesboro, VA",93,1,,1.0,2015-10-18,"I'm not sure if they got a new chef or not, but the food was cold, steaks weren't really seasoned. Waitress was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
11,Elizabeth O.,"Waynesboro, VA",8,31,,4.0,2015-11-16,"This Applebee's was great! So over the years, I've gone to various Applebee's with mixed reviews. It seemed as though Applebee's in general had gone downhill over the past few years, and my husband and I had decided not to eat there anymore. Someone gave us a gift card, so we decided to try it again. This visit was our first to the Waynesboro location, and we will definitely go back. There were some new and tasty menu items since our last visit. They also had a kids eat free night because of Halloween (usually weekly on Tuesdays). My husband had a burger, and I had salmon. Yum!  The service was great, and we got seated immediAtley even on the busy Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
14,Sara G.,"Staunton, VA",0,10,2.0,2.0,2015-12-05,"Food, service and atmosphere reviewed below: Food: the food was so so. Nothing spectacular - normal chain restaurant food. Service: our hostess and server were both pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular - but got the job done on a busy Saturday night.  Atmosphere: the staff KILLED any sliver of hope for anything related to ambiance. We were seated in a back corner near the restrooms and server area. Additionally, we were seated next to what seemed like a regular customer (or someone important to the staff). If the staff wasn't yelling over our table to each other, then they were crowded around this woman and cutting up the whole time. A crowd of 3-4 staff members crowding around this woman and, subsequently, encroaching on our table was constant for the entire meal. The server area was more a place to gossip and chat about evening plans than it was to get work done. To top it off, they propped open a door (even after asking them to close it) several times... And it was 36 degrees outside. Overall, the staff that WASN'T serving us ended up being the ones that ruined it for us. UPDATE: was contacted by corporate and asked for a phone number so the manager could reach out. A month later and I still haven't heard anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
10,Jimmy C.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,11,1.0,1.0,2015-12-12,Well it's sad to say my review will be similar to others. Service here has declined since our last visit. The person who originally greeted us after as if it were a burden to seat us with over half there tables empty. After our visit I know why they were empty. We got refills right before the check. Then the crazy new table computer stopped advertising to ask if we wanted a refill. There are too many good places to eat close by to consider eating at this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
9,Lindsey C.,"Herndon, VA",196,2,,5.0,2016-02-23,"My group and I had an AWESOME experience at this Applebee's on Saturday. We finished up an evening of snowboarding at Wintergreen and found that this Applebee's (about 30 mins away) was the only thing open at 11:30pm on a Saturday night. Our waitress, Katie was personable, funny, and patient with our somewhat rowdy group. She remembered our entire table's orders from memory, and everything came out tasting great. The time got away from us, and we didn't end up leaving until about 1:30am (a half hour after the restaurant closed). Even after overstaying our welcome, the Manager offered up some great tips for our next day at Wintergreen, and welcomed us back if we were in the area again. Thanks for having us, and we'll definitely stop in the next trip we make!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
8,Brad J.,"Waynesboro, VA",11,2,2.0,1.0,2016-03-22,Level of service has went downhill recently. Kitchen staff seem exceptionally slow as well. Is there a less than 1* rating....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
15,Kelly B.,"Waynesboro, VA",0,3,,1.0,2016-05-10,First ordered a Long Island iced tea. The drink wasn't made properly tasting no alcohol. Ordered the boneless chicken wings & the chicken was raw . Ordered the 6 oz. sirloin with potatoe. The steak was over cooked & tasted as if the cook dropped cigarette ashes . The potatoe was undercooked. Over the last 3 visits noticed the food quality was terrible. Won't be coming back. Only went because I thought the food would get better but I was wrong. I would never recommend .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
7,Tyler R.,"Afton, VA",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-06,"Last week we visited and the steak was over cooked to the point where you couldn't even chew it. Today we visited again and I ordered the ribs. They were extremely dry and I couldn't get through two bites. I told the server. She offered to give me something else but I had lost my appetite at that point.  Not to mention the fact that today the manager just happened to come by and see that I was not happy and HE took the ribs off my ticket, but the server never offered to do so. As a server myself for about 5 years now I know if you want to please your customers you don't charge them for things they cannot even eat. Applebees has always been my favorite but we will not be back after these experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
5,Tiffany L.,"Waynesboro, VA",52,10,2.0,2.0,2017-01-11,"Server was not very friendly. She messed up our order and didn't even apologize. She walked by our table several times before we finally got a refill on our drinks. My boyfriend got his food before I got mine and before we even got our appetizer. The appetizer was good and hot. My boyfriend's pasta was not creamy like it usually is when he gets it. To try something new, I got the fiesta lime chicken which comes with rice. Do not get this! I'm not sure how it is still on the menu. The chicken was dry and the flavor was unappetizing. It comes on a bed of tortilla strips, which just doesnt seem to go together. I didnt eat more than two bites of the chicken because it was basically inedible to me. The rice had no flavor and the texture was as if it had been heated up too long in the microwave...it was sticking together and it was chewy. Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
4,Jordan W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,1.0,1.0,2017-07-17,"It was late at night at we had no other food options, and since Applebees is a well known chain, I thought it would be fine. We arrived at a 10:30 on a Sunday evening after being at the hospital all day. Once seated, we had our order taken. I originally ordered a Thai salad and my husband ordered a chicken sandwich. Ten minutes later the waitress returned to tell me they were out of something to make salad...quickly I chose something else. Five minutes later, she returned to tell my husband they were out of something to make his sandwich. We expressed our since of urgency due to our tired state and she explained she'd rush it and let the manager know. Finally, the manager comes over and sits down at the booth across from us and the first thing he said was how his feet hurt and how tired he was. He spoke with my husband about his sandwich being unavailable and was unapologetic but wanted to know what he ordered instead. He had to be reminded  about my salad. Never once did he apologize or express regrets about our orders. He just said good choice to my husband about his replacement order. While we were waiting on our food, i watched the bartender have a girl hang all over him and the manager kiss and hug two women that left the restaurant. It was very unprofessional. To top it all off, we got our check, nothing comped! No offer of making it right at all. If I were the owner of that applebees, I'd be embarrassed of my employees and their behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
3,Valerie P.,"Easton, MD",1,3,,1.0,2017-08-08,"Don't know why I should expect differently, but it took 30 extra minutes for a to go order. No explanation and no help from the manager. Would not recommend at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waynesboro-3,,,,,
