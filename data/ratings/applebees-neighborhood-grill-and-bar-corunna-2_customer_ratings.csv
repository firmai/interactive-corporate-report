5,Michael G.,"Ann Arbor, MI",1,8,1.0,5.0,2013-12-28,"Only my second time to one of these chains. Overall I was very pleased. Food was great and filling. Service was a bit slow, but it was probably just a busy night. Overall very pleased and would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
3,Just A.,"Lansing, MI",0,24,,2.0,2014-12-02,My wife and I came here on a Sunday night as a night out. The food was prepared correctly and tasted ok but the portion was way to small for the money. Service has gotten a little better here but not by much. It's almost impossible to go in and not be subjected to kids running back and forth. This is a restaurant not a playground. I'm thinking it's one of the wait staff's kids bc it's the same kid every time.  Management just shrugs their shoulders and says theirs nothing we can do. Over all things are a little better but not much,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
2,Richard B.,"Mason, MI",0,13,4.0,2.0,2015-02-28,"I recently took my family to the Applebees in Okemos Mi and thought I should review my experience.  Pros:  1.) Good atmosphere. 2.) Good food. 3.) Good customer service.  Cons: 1.) The menue is shrinking.  2.) The food is getting more expensive.  3.) You pay more for less at this applebees.  We had a staff member open the door for us when we entered the building and were seated right away for lunch which was nice.  We ordered an appetizer (The Sampler) and was told that the sampler would no longer be on the menu soon. We received the app 20 minutes later. When we were asked if we were ready to order our dinner, we were told ""We don't have that anymore"" on several items that were still on the menu... Applebees is stripping out there menu of anything that is ""Not Healthy"" but keeping fries and ribs???  When I received my dinner, there was barely any food on the plate! My family (4 year old daughter and wife) barely had any food on their plates as well and the bill was unusually high.  Applebee's use to be an enjoyable family restaurant with good food for a reasonable cost but now seems to lack food options, and increased the prices.     I paid the bloated bill and left still hungry.  If you are a small guy with a tiny stomach and like paying top dollar for small portions of food, this is the place for you.  Come on Applebee's.... If I want to eat healthy, I will go eat at a health place. Applebee's should have taken some feedback from its customers before destroying a great menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
1,Ryan K.,"Saint Johns, MI",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-01-05,"I was out with my wife for a nice evening. We were going to see the new Frankenstein movie and had a little bit of time before the movie. So we stopped to eat. I ordered a nice burger and my wife just wanted a simple ham and cheese. When the food came back i got my burger and she got the mac n cheese. The waitress didn't even bring the food out so when she came back she said ""oh so you just want a ham and cheese kids meal"". So she knew what my wife said she just decided  to mess up the order. After another 30 min wait i get my old reheated burger and my wife gets a grilled cheese. Now we are late for the movie so we have to leave in a rush. When i get the bill and i was charged for the messed up order we didn't eat. At this point i just wanted to get out of there and never come back so i paid it anyway and i was still late for the movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
4,Shaun C.,"Owosso, MI",0,33,1.0,1.0,2016-01-16,"This has to be the worst restaurant I have ever been to. My wife and I have lived in Owosso for almost 3 years and have been to this Applebees probably 10 times. Every time we go, sometimes inside sometimes togo, we have the absolute worst service. We keep returning thinking maybe this time it will be good, but no, never happens. Tonight I placed an order by phone, was told 20mins and it would be done. On the phoney order was read back to me twice. When I arrived to get my food half my order was missing and not even on my receipt. So I had to wait for my food to cook, while my other food got cold and my wife's desserts ice cream melted. I asked to speak with a manager but one never came out. When I got home my wife noticed that the extra dressings where not there, and that part of her meal was made incorrectly. This seems to be SOP for this Applebee's location. Last time we ordered I had to drive back because they forgot half my order. The fast I have ever been in amd out inside is 2 hours, and thats not waitong for a table, just getting food and paying. If you like Applebee's I would avoid this location because it will destroy your view of this resturant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
0,Rod W.,"Oakley, MI",4,161,187.0,3.0,2017-01-22,"Ok, it's Applebees. You know what to expect if you ever are here before. This time the burger was exceptional. The server could have cared less if she was there or not. The $10 burger, fry, soda special was worth it. 1/2 price apps everyday after 8 or 9 depending on the day is always a special treat. We will be back but do enjoy new places. If you want to know what you are getting this is worth the stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-corunna-2,,,,,
