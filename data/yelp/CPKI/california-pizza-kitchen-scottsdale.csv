Stacie M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",69,27,1,1.0,8/11/2016,"I use to love this place. But the last time I ordered they messed it up, even after repeating it 3 times. Then when I got home there was a black hair in my food. I have long blond hair, I discovered it in my mouth! Yuck! I called the manager to let him know about my bad experience. He was very apologetic and offered to give me my money back. Also he said he would send me a gift certificate for the value of my meal. Well guess what, nothing happened. No refund on my card or certificate in the mail. It's been close to 3 weeks. I  called the restaurant last Saturday to find out what happened, he sounded so sincere.  The manager who was on said it was a different manager who will be working Sunday. He took my info and said he will have him call me. Did I get a call, nope... I'm done with this place, ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=20

Victor C.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,6,,5.0,5/26/2016,"I had the pleasure of eating at the California Pizza Kitchen on the corner of Scottsdale & Gold Dust. As I was walking in from the parking lot a I noticed almost an absurd amount of curbside pick up spaces it was almost comical! My children and I walked in the front door and were welcomed immediately with a pleasant smile from the host stand! We were shown directly to a seat! Temperature inside the restraint was cool and comfortable, a nice contrast to outside! My daughters and I were greeted promptly by our server Courtney! My youngest daughter has a dietary restrictionthat prevents her from eating wheat. Courtney was diligent in making sure my girls had the best experience possible while being mindful of my daughters allergy.  While we always expect the food and service to be good, Courtney's performance level of service and professionalism put our experience over the top today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=20
Food L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,1.0,8/2/2016,Visited again and it has gotten worse here. The employees bark at everyone they talk to and use condescending tones.  They freeze up when faced with a task and take it out on their computer workers and delivery drivers with severe aggression right in front of customers. I watched as 3 different delivery drivers were berated by an employee for whatever reason. Do not go to this place.

Carter A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",111,36,2,2.0,9/11/2015,"I have been here 3 times now and had a fairly average experience, but today was really a disappointment. Service was slow and I felt like an inconvenience. The chef who appeared to also be the manager on duty didn't seem concerned about the quality of food even though he ran it to me at the bar. My pizza looked more like some salad and you can see all of the left over greens in the attached picture. I ate about half of the greens on the California club and this was all left over.

Tess G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/25/2017,"I called 3x to order catering . I was given the run around. First time I called at  11am Jan 19 the  person that answered said that manager is not in yet and he is not authorized to get catering order. Odd that he didn't even ask for my name and number so manager can call me back to take order. I called again after one hour and I was put on hold for 15 mins to get the person that takes the order! I hung up and called again and I asked for the manager . I just wanted to order catering  and I don't know why it's so hard to do place the order! Again, the person that answered for the third time said that the manager was "" too busy"" !! Really??? Too busy to talk to customer who wants to order catering???  Even if manager is busy, why can't anyone take my name and number and they should call me back to get the order. So frustrated with customer service!!! So poor! And it's starts from management . I hung up and called Maggianos.

The only negative for us is that it sometimes feels and looks like they're understaffed, not that you could tell by the wait staff running around. The service is fast and efficient.

Queen Happy Face X.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",193,136,14,4.0,10/2/2014,"Who doesn't love CPK? Their craft is a good and reliable as any other family chain.  My review is mainly in regards to my interaction with Tony the manager. He was a dream, helpful, friendly, and outgoing.   I walked to this CPK near my house and I sat at the bar by myself after a long Friday at work, I was hungry and needing a cocktail. Tony suggested a cocktail consisting of tequila and fresh strawberries..... yum!

Jeff B.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,328,174,3.0,12/29/2013,"First time at CPK tonight. Ordered drinks and got menus. Server was a bit hazy on specialty beers available but was speedy at this point. I ordered a pizza but had a change to make on it: I wanted thin crust toppings on a regular crust. He said no prob. My daughter ordered the spinach and artichoke thin crust pie while her boyfriend got the spaghetti bolognese.  Spaghetti was fairly bland, pretty much due to a non-aggressive chef choices.  The spinach and artichoke pizza was very good with a crisp crust and ample toppings. The meat lovers had really good toppings but the crust?  It looked like they tacked a ring of dough onto a thin crust pizza. Some of you like thin crust but not me. Don't want my toppings on a saline cracker.  Service, while very pleasant, was sporadic. When he arrived, he was good. When he wasn't there, he was gone a long time. At one point I even asked if he had left for the night.  I'll try CPK again but not the pizza. I really dislike thin crust pizza.

J D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",4958,1982,28925,3.0,3/16/2013,"Mom bought us gift cards to CPK for Christmas, so we were able to visit this location a few times over the past couple of months.  It's been a while since I've had CPK and they had some new appetizers on the menu.  We decided to give them a try in addition to our fav Pizzas.  Here's what we ordered during our visits: White Corn Guacamole & Chips (Diced Avocado, Wweet White Corn, Black Beans, Jicama, Bell Pepper, Cilantro and Serrano Peppers), $3.75 Crispy Fried Mac n Cheese, $3.75 Mediterranean Foccacia, $2.50 Tuscan Hummus, $6.50 Sicilian Pizza (Spicy Marinara, Italian Sausage, spicy Capicola Ham, Salami, Mozzarella, Parmesan, Basil, Oregano), $14.00 Pepperoni Pizza, $12.00 Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake The White Corn Guacamole tastes awesome, but the Chips suck.  The Chips tasted stale.  However, kudos to the CPK team on creating a yummy variation of Guacamole.  The Fried Mac n Cheese was awesome too.  The Mediterranean Foccacia was too hard for our tastes....we won't order it again. The Sicilian Pizza is my fav...I always get it.  This location does a good job at delivering a tasty old favorite.  Of course, the Pepperoni is a classic and they do it well. For dessert, the Belgian Chocolate Souffle is awesome...very rich.  I split it with The Better Half. Service here is so/so....they have some young kids who you can tell it's their first serving job.  They're nice though, but need to learn the more refined aspects of customer service.....like making sure your Wine glass is never empty and offering dessert....we had to ask.

Stephanie B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",61,81,23,5.0,7/3/2014,I love this place! I usually get their taco pizza because it is so unique and is thin crust and light enough to not make you feel stuffed. I usually try a different salad each time too.  Their food is always consistent and I love it! It is not like a typical NY pizza though. It is more Americanized so not much sauce on it.  I really like their food. It is always fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=20

Called and talked to the manager Tony, who apologized,  saying he'd send a $15 gift card and if I stopped by I could get the correct soup. Went there today and the take out girl said Tony told her I had ordered one cup each of potato and pea sou.  He told her to give me one cup of potato soup.  I corrected her, she called Tony, and he grudgingly agreed to give me the 2 bowls of potato soup, but that he wasn't going to send the gift card.

The food, however, was not up to usual CPK standards. The BBQ chopped chicken salad was essentially flavorless aside from the cloying BBQ sauce. The bianco flatbread had hardly any toppings on it.

Jade W.,"Goodyear, AZ",18,321,20,4.0,1/11/2015,"I really enjoy California Pizza Kitchen and wish they had a location in the west valley! I like that their pizza crust is thin, yet soft. That's not an easy combination to find. Ate here for dinner last night and it wasn't very busy, but it was a little early so that may be why. I ordered the pepperoni pizza and my friend ordered the BBQ chicken pizza without onions and added bacon. We shared for a little variety. They were very tasty! The crust on the BBQ chicken was a little darker and not as soft so they must have cooked it a little long, but the sauce was smoky and delicious and I enjoyed it. The pepperoni was yummy. Service was good but he forgot about our drinks for a little while, although he tried to make up for it towards the end. I was happy overall.

We didn't.  She gave me a good recommendation for wine and she was very personable and seemed to enjoy her job.  So nice to see happy employees!   My dad knew what he wanted, he orders it everytime, the chicken tequila fettichini with extra limes.  I usually do a pizza but splurged and went for the pesto cream penne.  I enjoyed it but I was confused with them calling it pesto. I didn't see much if any pesto. And the cream sauce was hardly there the penne was dry on the top. It looked like the sauce was not mixed in with the pasta.  Some of the penne tasted undercooked.  Overall, the dish was ok.

I had a pizza with the Gluten Free dough.  I guess that was my fault.  It was doughy and undercooked with no flavor.  If I go to any CPK again I won't order that.  My biggest complaint was the bar service.  I sat right across from the bar service.  I ordered a full glass of Cabernet.  The waitress (who was very polite and sweet) delivered it with a smile.  I stopped her and explained that I had ordered a full glass, not a half glass.  She apologized and said it was a full glass but it would show up as two 1/2 glasses on my bill.  (my suspicious mind begins).  I'm watching the bartender.  he's making two strawberry Martguerita's or daiquiris.  He pours them out and one comes up very short.  So, instead of adding a little more alcohot and giving it another shake, he holds the glass under the sink and tops it off with tap water.  I stared at him and shook my head and he ignored me.

Morgan D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,2.0,10/14/2013,"Our waiter, Chris, was fantastic. But the so-called manager, April, is condescending and rude. I don't understand how someone like this can represent a place we usually love. We go to this location about twice a month. My wife usually orders the same thing, but decided to try something new. My wife made a poor decision about what she wanted to eat. She ended up not liking it and we were apologetic to our waiter. My wife had no more than two bites of the dish she didn't enjoy. The waiter was great, and offered my wife something else on the menu. After the waiter walked away, this ""manager"", April, came over and started telling us about how that's one of the most popular items on the menu and why everyone likes it. We apologized for not liking it (doesn't that seem ridiculous in itself?), and admitted it was a poor choice on our behalf. She continued to almost lecture us as to why that dish was good. She even pointed out other people in the restaurant who were eating it. Who cares? We already said it was our fault. Why are you hassling us? By the time April left our table, my wife got her new pasta. It was cold. And I mean, the sauce had hardened and the bottom of the bowl was barely warm. Again, being extremely polite with our waiter, we apologized and asked him to reheat it. The server was beyond apologetic and said that it was completely unacceptable to receive a dish in that state (note that our sever did not bring the food over, someone else did). I can not enthuse any more how great our waiter was. He left to get the dish remade or reheated. Back comes ""manager"" April and says ""didn't like THAT one either?"" Like we were trying to get something out of this. We explained that the dish was cold. All she said was ""ok"" and walked away. No apology or anything. In fact, still in an accusing matter. We stopped another server, her name I don't recall, to ask if April was the general manager. It turns out this girl is just a glorified server. A shift manager. Why would the managers here allow such a person to represent them, their restaurant and their staff? When we got our check, it had the first dish on there, and we made no comment to take it off the bill as it was our mistake. Our waiter, Chris, came back over and said he had asked his ""manager"" to take it off the check but she had probably just 'forgotten'. Based on her attitude, highly unlikely. Not that we wouldn't have happily paid for it. It took about 10 minutes for our new check to come back to us as we watched our waiter, seemingly, having to argue with the girl to get the dish removed. As we left, April was at the door and said ""at least you know what you won't get next time"". Yes, thank you for that very obvious and unnecessary comment. Our waiter was wonderful. We highly recommend Chris. On the other hand, if we walk into that restaurant again and see April ""managing"", we will walk across the road to Macaroni Grill instead. Such a shame that ONE girl had to ruin a place we usually enjoy. Tip to the actual managers- get that girl OUT of her power position. She is incapable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=40

When we ordered we had the lunch menu and we ordered a pizza and soup/salad combination. Which runs about 11 dollars each.  When they brought out the pizza, they were full sized, which I thought was weird since it was lunch time.  When we got the bill we were charged for a full pizza and a side.

Stacey S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",110,108,113,3.0,10/10/2016,"Decided to come to CPK with my boyfriend for a casual dinner Saturday night before heading to Topgolf. I love the look of this place- trendy décor and a pretty sleek design concept. They have a fairly large menu and a lot of food choices ranging from salads, to pasta, to pizza and a few Asian inspired dishes as well, surprisingly. One thing I really appreciate is the complimentary bread & olive oil. Restaurants seem to be quickly moving away from the ""free bread"" model much to my chagrin! But luckily, CPK hasn't. They served us a small loaf of yummy, crusty Italian bread that was warm & very soft in the middle. For the entrees my boyfriend went with the shrimp scampi zucchini- it had some tasty looking zucchini ribbons and fettucine pasta with scampi sauce and shrimp. He was pleased with the serving size and taste. I ordered the pesto cream penne and was much less enthusiastic. I think I expected it to be more ""pesto-ey""? Any other time I've ordered a pesto based pasta dish somewhere, the sauce is actually green and I can taste some pesto. Well...can't say that's the case here. It looked like they served me regular penne with a trace of cream sauce, a few shrimp, and a TON of sun-dried tomatoes. Waaaay too many sun dried tomatoes and not enough shrimp or pesto.  Would not recommend or order again, but I am willing to come back again and try other dishes.

We wanted to book a birthday party, and after one submitted request on line and an email, I got a response from a manager Tammie, mentioning I had to call the restaurant directly and speak to someone there to arrange planning the event. I called the following day, only to be told by the person on the phone that I had to speak to Tammie to plan the event, and was told to call her the following day since she was not in that day. I called the following day, and was unable to get a hold of her and left my phone and message again for Tammie, to which I got no response. After getting the runaround for the week, I realize it was best to let it go, and plan our event at another California Pizza Kitchen farther away, which was actually more accommodating, with the other location having returned our phone call in less than 24 hours.

Will B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",26,70,123,5.0,10/2/2010,"I love the wide menu selections and the non-traditional, Cali-inspired pizzas. I've had several dishes at CPK and they've all been good. My fave dish has to be this roasted garlic pasta dish. I can't remember what it's called exactly as it's been a while. It's basically a white, creamy pasta dish with roasted garlic, mushrooms, cheese, optional shrimp and another optional ingredient.  I always requested the shrimp.  I'm not sure CPK still serves this dish as I don't see it on their online menu anymore, but it tasted amazing. A shame if they don't have it anymore. It was so good that I attempted to make it at home. My home version was really good, but roasting the garlic takes a lot of time and effort. I wouldn't want to attempt to make it again because of all of the work involved. My other fave, which CPK does still serve, is the Maui Punch. It is a combination of orange, pineapple, and a touch of grenadine. Again, I attempted to make a version of this at home. A restaurant receives the highest compliment from me whenever they can inspire me to imitate their dishes at home. My review so far really applies to any CPK that I've visited, but the one thing that this particular CPK has that sets it apart from the others in The Valley of the Sun is the patio area. It's a great area to hang out in during the cool weather months because that's the time they open up their french doors to let our fabulous winter weather in. This is a feature not common here in the desert, but you may run across in cities located on the coasts.

The food was fine enough but over $40 for pizza (only 4 of us ate) is a lot. I had not been to a CPK in over 15 years and now I remember why. We have had way better pizza around Phoenix and I think independently owned restaurants are better than chains. I like to cook a lot and don't like to go out and pay a lot for food that's easily replicated at home.   I gave 3 stars because the pizza was decent and the atmosphere is neat, with the windows thrown open. The crust is missing that yeasty, homemade smell and taste I love. If I go back I might try the Thai salad or something different.

Normally, we order one of the thin and crispy Neapolitan pizzas such as the classic Margherita but this time broke ranks for the ""new"" pizza called Pear & Gorgonzola.  The ingredients (caramelized pears, Gorgonzola, Fontina and Mozzarella cheeses, caramelized sweet onions and chopped hazelnuts) sounded different and inviting.  Indeed it was different from the usual fare and quite a mixture of tastes with some crunch and caramelization flavors.  It was somewhat of a surprise to have it topped with field greens tossed in a house Gorgonzola ranch dressing.  Thumbs up for the pizza and neutral to negative for the field greens topping.  If there had been a choice of toppings another would have been ordered.

My experience a few nights ago at this location, though, was absolutely disappointing.  When we first sat down, I ordered a glass of water and a full glass of their house Pinot Noir.  The water never came, and our spunky little waitress returned with a glass of white wine.  Confused, I politely asked for a glass of Pinot Noir again, and specified that it was a red wine.  She argued and said, ""No, you ordered Pinot Grigio, so here."" So, I drank it anyways because I am not the arguing type.  When it came time to order, we ordered spinach dip as an appetizer, and my friend and I split a full-size BBQ chicken salad and a mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza on a thin crust for our entrees. Considering this is three of, what I assume to be, their most popular items, I expected the exceptional quality of food I usually receive there.  The spinach dip, which was cold, came out at the same time as the salad and pizza. The pizza wasn't on a thin crust. The waitress never returned to ask for refills or anything, so we had to flag down another waiter for our bill.
