The place was packed when we got there, few minutes of wait which did not bother me at all. The servers are I would say excellent, they refilled our drinks when ours are almost at the bottom, good job! When we seated we saw at least 5 servers smiling and attending to serve our order.  I had the baby back ribs, 20% meat and the rest are bones. I love their potato swirl, and the sauce that came with it. I think I saw the manager 2 hours after their opening time, for a new business like this he should be there when they open it so he can see and correct whatever is needed of correction. Overall, I like it. I don't mind coming back here.

117,Patricia K.,"Lompoc, CA",62,4,2.0,3.0,2013-10-27,"Excited there is a new place in town! My fiancé and I went in for lunch. When we arrived I expected there to be a longer wait than just five minutes. The past few times we have gone to Applebee's there was a 30 min wait and we ended up leaving.  The place was busy and took some time for our server to come over and take our order.  I love that the art on the wall are murals of Lompoc and the area. There are murals of some of the local high school sports stars and the delta 4 heavy rocket that recently launched at Vandenberg. When she did come over she was friendly and helpful. We got our drinks very quickly after she left.   My only complaint was that it took quite a while for our appetizer to show up. And when it finally came they brought our appetizer along with our entrees. Kind of disappointing. If this hadn't happened the Lompoc Applebee's would have received 4 stars instead of three. I am hoping that with time they will work out these kinks.  We got our check soon after we were finished, and 10% off for my fiancé being in the military!

96,Bill F.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,2.0,2013-10-28,I have been to Applebee's a few times and had amazing service. But I went tonight and it took over 10 minutes to get the hostess to bring our drinks. Then 7 minutes later our sever came for the first time and took our order and that was the last time we saw him. Another server brought our food. Had to get the hostess to bring the manager cause our sever didn't come to our table at all. He seemed to go to every other table but ours. We got the manager and he took care of us and comped the meal.

70,Ken C.,"Lompoc, CA",0,20,1.0,3.0,2013-11-01,"My wife and I were very happy to see an Applebees open in Lompoc. When we walked through the doors I was shocked to see all the cobwebs, but because it was Halloween I accepted it (kidding). The host took our name and said it would be about a 15-20 minute wait, which I couldn't understand because there were several empty tables. To our surprise, the wait was actually only 5 minutes. The atmosphere was nice, the bar was crowded and lots of TV's. The only issue I had was it was a Thursday night and being a huge NFL football fan I would have thought they would be televising the game. When we asked the host if he would have the channel changed to the game that was on the TV above our table, he gave us a fake smile and said yes....we both knew it wouldn't happen, and it didn't..he just blew us off. We finally stopped the manager and he finally changed it to the game.  As for the food and service, our waitress was very friendly and stopped by our table several times to make sure our food was okay and our drinks were always full. We both had the Parmesan Steak and Shrimp, the picture was on the menu and it looked really good. When we got our meals it didn't look much like the picture, but the flavor was good. The steak was good and cooked the way I like it, although the shrimp was a little overcooked. The mashed potatoes were awesome! I would have liked to have had a soup or salad, and maybe some bread with the meal.  I give our waitress and manager 5 stars, the food 3 stars, and the host 1 star for taking our name and -4 for snubbing us.

We had to wait five minuets to be helped once we were helped it took a while for our drinks to come out. When we finally ordered our food, for some reason the server forgot how to take a order and just started writing stuff down or something. Our food came out wrong. Once our food did come to us they never came back to see how we were doing, or filled our drinks. So we sat with empty glasses. When we asked for a to go box he brought out the smallest box they had.

I have been a sever / bartender for 15 years I can understand a busy place. This was not the case there was only 4 sat tables, I counted 8 severs( most just standing by the computer talking) I cant imagine that it takes 45 min to make 2 half sandwich and salads. If this place does not get it together it will not last. Oh and the two managers that were on duty were sitting in a booth two tables over eating and chatting it up with the staff that was not at the computer.

62,Russ R.,"Lompoc, CA",11,103,17.0,1.0,2014-07-28,"Third trip was just now (this evening) so they have had lots of time to iron out the bugs since opening. Arrived at 6:10pm to no one at the hostess stand. It only took a minute waiting and a gal showed up and seated us right away at a booth. She told us our server would be with us soon. Our server (Presley) came right away, very friendly and welcoming, asked for our beverage order.  I ordered a Sam Adams Boston Lager and a cold glass, wife ordered Water with a few slices of Lemon. The server brought out the Water and said she'd be right back with my beer. I opened my the knapkin that held the knife and fork, only to see food remains on both the knife, as well as the fork. When Presley brought the beer she apologized they were out of cold glasses, so offered to put ice in a glass to chill it before bringing it. Very thoughtful. I then gave her the utensils showing her the remains of someone elses meal. She apologized and grabbed them up. When she returned, it was with a clean set of silverware, a clean knapkin, and a chilled glass for my beer.  I poured it half way only to notice the glass was cracked all the way down and it had a sharp edge on the rim. I flagged Presley, she was embarrassed and apologetically picked up the glass. She asked if I wanted the remainder of the beer in the bottle, which was nice, but I waited for a new one and cold glass that came out in 2 minutes. So far Aplebees was not scoring well, but Presley was taking it very professionally.  We then ordered our meals. My wife ordering their Chicken Mac and Cheese (and the menu said it was ""loaded with Applewood Bacon),  I ordered the Bourbon Burger & fries. I was asked ""pink"" or ""no pink"", so I said ""pink"", since I order burgers medium rare. Food arrived within 10 minutes, and I could not help but to note that the $10 Mac and Cheese had just a few little pieces of Chicken and I would bet there was not even one slice of Bacon on top (it was chopped up so hard to tell accurately). I guess Applebees thinks one slice makes it 'loaded' with Bacon. Anyway, my wife didn't complain, she said it tasted good. My burger was a different issue. The fries were lukewarm at best, the ketchup container on the table was empty, and the burger bun was wreaking in grease and meat juices. it literally was inedible. I flagged Presley down again, pointed this out, and asked her to please bring me a new lower bun. Within 2 minutes she returned with it.   The only nice part of this experience was Presley. I felt she was very professional in the way she handled everything, and she needs to be working in somewhere less embarassing.  I feel the only reason Applebees is still open is because Lompoc has so few good eating establishments. Carrows was the same way, and they are now closed.  Our two meals cost $29, and with a $6 tip it came to $35.  I can go to Vons and for $35 I can make 4 fantastic gourmet meals for my wife and myself, so why go out only to get dirty utensils, broken glasses, and poorly prepared food.  Makes absolutely no sense.   This was strike 3, and sorry to have to say it, but they are OUT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lompoc-3?start=80,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.7640000000000002,2.12

Or 2. They have a set time that they need to keep as a minimum,  ans were just pulled early. Either way they sucked. Also the coffee service was slow, unreasonably slow.

Anyway, we ordered the Cavatappi pasta with chicken, the shrimp stir fry, and the lunch special that included the chicken tortilla soup and a half chicken/bacon club sandwich. First let me say that we were the very first customers of the day. No other people in the restaurant and it was exactly 11 a.m. so I expected to: (A) Get good quality/hot food and: (B) To get it pretty quickly. I was mistaken on both points. The waitress was very nice and so was the host who greeted us however I really must say the cook in the kitchen is not very good. We didn't get our orders for a really really really long time. Exceptionally long for being the only customers in the joint. And when we got our food...well the soup was cold. And so was my sandwich. The bread looked grilled but it was super cold and the bacon was super duper uber cold; as if it was pulled out of the refrigerator and placed directly on the bread. The pasta was actually good however it was unevenly warmed. Very hot in some places in the bowl and very cold in others. The shrimp stir fry was next to terrible; lacking flavor and any sort of spice. Those frozen diet meals are better tasting. I told the waitress about the soup and the sandwich being so cold and she apologized and took them back. When she brought the soup back the crispy tortilla chips on top had melted into the soup and became moosh. Sigh...she really should have offered a percentage off or a free dessert or something. They wouldn't even honor the military discount on any of these meals. Anyway it's sad that Applebee's was so highly anticipated in Lompoc and instead of thriving it is seriously diving.

So I wait for my food an additional 20 minutes after the time it should be done.  By the time I step foot out the door and in my car i check the food it is cold already and to my surprise my order was missing two sides of fries that comes with the chicken platter.  I go back in tell the server what happen she says oh ya I forgot your fries. Goes back to the nav for 20 more minutes just to get two sides of fries comes out they were not fresh so long story short had a whole bunch of cold nasty food,by the time I got home.

Coming from LA you would think a small city compared to mine would have excellent food, but then again it is LOMPOC. Food was cold and it tasted like a frozen dinner.

This is ridiculous!!! We should have listened to the bad 2 out of 5 star rating. They blamed it on 40 people putting orders in at the same time. They should have politely told us they were not going to be able to help us. When we finally got the food, it was a complete disappointment. Steaks were cold, 1 of the 3 shrimp skewers were dry and cold. My sons grilled cheese did not have the cheese melted. We seriously thought that a discount was the least they could do for us, but to our surprise there was no discount on the check! My husband told the waitress that we wanted to speak to the manager because of the long wait and inconvenience, well the manager never came and instead we got an $8.00 discount of our bill.
