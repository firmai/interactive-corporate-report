However, I ordered a Salted Carmel Cake to go. Last time I got it, the best part was the crunch in top. I got home and it was not on there. I called and the person that answered the phone said some people don't like that on the dessert to go...so I need to be sure to ask for. She didn't offer to let me come pick up another done right...so in other words make sure you ask for your item as it's stated it will come on the menu, or it's your fault.

31,Korey H.,"Garland, TX",1,1,,1.0,2012-09-09,"My fiance and I placed a to go order at 11pm 9/8/12. I actually placed the to go order on speaker phone. A worker named Brandon answered the phone and I told him I needed to place an order. He put me on hold and I waited for another person to answer the phone. It was a female who answered, and I ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta, an order of boneless buffalo wings, and a side of breadsticks. On the phone, the girl repeated the order back to me and asked me if I would like bone in or bone out. I also asked what flavors the wings came in and she told me bbq and buffalo. We chose buffalo. We also told her that we had a coupon for a free appetizer. She then asked to place us on hold, so that she could ring the items in and give us our total. We were on hold for seven minutes when the manager, Carol, answered the phone and asked us if we were still holding to place our to go order. I told her that someone else had already taken our order and that we were just waiting for a total. She said, ""Ok,"" and just put me back on hold. We waited another ten minutes, when I just decided to hang up the phone because we were tired of waiting.  We got there at 11:30pm, and my fiancé went inside to pick up the order. He was greeted by the hostess, and he told her he had a to go order to pick up. She told him that it would be ready in a few minutes and asked him if he needed anything else with his order. He asked her if she put the ranch and blue cheese in the bag for the wings. She appeared shocked and asked him, ""What wings?"" (like she she had forgotten to put them in.) At that moment, the manager walked up with the order, and the hostess told her that we were missing some wings. The manager snapped back and said, ""She didn't order any wings."" (How would she know if she didn't even take the order?) My fiancé, then told her, ""Yes she did, she ordered boneless buffalo wings."" The manager, Carol, replied, ""No, she only ordered the pasta and the breadsticks."" He then said, ""Yeah, the person that took the order asked whether she wanted bone in or bone out, and told her what flavors y'all had. My fiancé also had the phone on speaker, so I heard her order them."" Before he could finish his sentence, the manager cut him off and told him that she would go get the wings but it would be a few minutes.   Approximately ten minutes later, the manager came back with the buffalo wings and check. Once again, she tried to imply that we were lying by telling him that the person who placed the order did not tell them that they wanted wings. He tried to tell her again that we did order wings, and she cut him off again. Then, he signed the credit card slip, and the manager snatched it out of his hands before he could put the pen down. He left very upset and told me what happened.  Once we got home 12am, we sat down to eat, and I opened the to go container with buffalo wings, and the first wing that I saw had a curly black hair on it.  We decided that we would not eat any of the food, and that we would return it. We went into the restaurant, and my fiancé told me who the manager was. She asked if she could help us, and I said, ""Yes you can. We placed a to go order, and when we got home we found a black curly hair in the buffalo wings. We do not want our food anymore, can we just get our money back?"" She snapped back at me and said, ""Well, I seriously doubt that! And the wings were free."" (So once again she is implying that we were lying.)  I told her that there was a hair in there and she could look herself. I also told her that I knew that the wings were free, but we did not want any of our food anymore, and that I just wanted our money back. She snatched the wings out of my hand and the other bag out of my fiance's hand, and said that she would be back with a voucher, and that it would be a minute. A few minutes later she came back with cash and handed me the money. I asked my fiancé how much the tab was to ensure we got all of our money back, and she rudely butted in and said the total. I turned to Carol and told her, ""You really need to learn customer service because you do not treat your guest's this way."" She condescendingly asked, ""Well, do you want to come and teach me?"" We were taken aback by her awful attitude. She then told us, ""Y'all need to leave now. Y'all are not welcome here.""  We left the store very upset, and in shock that someone in that position would treat their guests that way.  As we were leaving, she turned to her employees and gawked at us with them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland?start=60,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

42,Arthur B.,"Dallas, TX",159,32,,1.0,2013-11-23,"This was the worst experience I've ever had an a T.G.I. FRIDAY'S!  My girlfriend and I went there last night and where shall I begin? Our waitress was sweet and nice, but everything else was beyond horrible. A couple of other waitresses were busy throwing things at each other and some I believe other workers who worked there, but where off at the table across from us. My girlfriend ordered the triple sample and had to sent it back two times. The second time the waitress even commented that she didn't know what was going on with the cooks and that she thinks they simply put her food in the microwave....Why are they serving cold food? And, correct me if I'm wrong but if a customer sends back food...shouldn't they throw it away and not re-heat it in the microwave???? And, of course while all of this is going on I'm still waiting on my food and when it does come ( I ordered the cheese and chicken breast plate) the chicken tasted like fish. I ate two bites of it and was done. The waitress went and got the manager and he pretty much accused us of just wanting free food. I'm like ""I don't even want any more food from here..I just want to go home"" He than admitted that they sometimes cook SHRIMP on the same pan/grill that they cook CHICKEN on and that might explain the taste!  What if I had a food allergy when it came to shrimp? This could have killed me!  And, I didn't even mention the warm beer! All I wanted was to take my girlfriend out for a half-decent meal and this was the result! I ended up going to the store and getting a TV  dinner to eat! Yah...I know sad, but what's even sadder is that it tasted better than what they were passing off as food!  Please if you're reading this review don't let this location keep you away from T.G.I. Friday's because all of the other locations I've been to have been great! But, this one...I didn't even one to give it one star, but our waitress was sweet and empathetic toward our situation!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland?start=40,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

You are served a Norwegian Salmon Fillet fire grilled to perfection topped with a succulent saute' of Langostino Lobster and ceremini mushrooms in a zesty roasted Alfredo sauce. Served with your choice of two sides.

12,Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22.0,1.0,2014-03-13,"I don't know WHAT happened to this place.  We'd been here before and had a decent, if overpriced, experience.  This visit we were greeted with an unpleasant smell upon entering and were told that they were in the process of renovations.  Then we were seated right next to the bathroom doors, presumably because we had children that would be noisier than the rest of the deafening patrons (?). Confusion is an issue here. I ordered a beer from the draft menu and recieved a bottle with the explanation that they didn't have it on tap that moment. Then we got an adult soda with my 3-year old's child menu order (sent back).  My daughter's dessert had to be sent back because she ordered it without certain things. Cleanliness was a problem.  The floors of the dining area had sticky spots and debris from previous meals.  My wife visited the ladies' room and literally couldn't use it because the toilet and the area around it were soaked, toilet paper and paper towels littered the floor, and the hand towel dispenser was empty.  That along with the smell made her leave the restaurant to wait in the car before her food even came. The wait for food was agonizingly slow.  It took 15 minutes to get our appetizer, and another 25 to get our main course.  By the time we got our main course we had been there long enough and my wife was already absent so we had to get to-go boxes and take half of it home. And then there was the bill.  We were charged $2.69 for the regular drink brought for my 3-year old that we sent back, the 3-item ""Taste and Share"" ended up totalling $19 before tax rather than the $15 the menu said, and of course there was the bottled beer I was charged $5.49 for in the bottle when I'd ordered the draft.  They charged me $1.79 for the wrong dessert for my 3-year old and neither made it into his to-go bag! All in all we spent $65.49 for what was supposed to be a nice family evening out that ended up being a hungry, dirty, overcharged and altogether unpleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

40,Marsha B.,"Dallas, TX",2,81,11.0,1.0,2014-03-25,"I recently had lunch at this location twice in a three week period. I ordered the same entree, the Chicken Salad Sandwich on toasted multi-grain bread with a side salad today, and sweet potato fries the first time.  Both times the bread on the sandwich was hard and dry. I mean VERY hard and dry.  Today I removed the bread and just ate the Chicken Salad with a fork, which tasted very good with dried cherries, nuts, onion, etc...in it.  On my previous visit, the sweet potato fries arrived hot and flavorful.  But today, my side salad was obviously out of a bag.  While most restaurants serve mixed pre-cut salads from a bag, there are levels of quality.  Apparently, TGI Friday's doesn't purchase a high quality of mixed greens. My salad was mainly lettuce stems with a paltry few shredded carrots, and one tiny tomato.    My friend and I noticed an odd sour/rotting smell at our table.  She thought it was coming from her plate of Chicken Salad Sandwich, and could only eat one bite of her sandwich.  I couldn't detect the odor on her plate or on mine, but did notice the odor.  She requested tortilla soup to replace the sandwich. Unfortunately she made a bad choice of soup.  It was barely warm and had a vinegar-like taste. After her sandwich plate was removed, we continued to smell the unappetising odor. I wonder if it was from soured mop water?  Since this restaurant allows smoking in the bar area, there is a strong smell of cigarette smoke in areas of the restaurant. Not sure what could be done about that.   Our server was friendly.  The manager did deduct the cost of the sandwich entree from my friend's bill. No one checked to see if the soup was satisfactory.   I don't think I'll give them another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland?start=40,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

Walked in around 3:00 pm on a Sunday to get a table. The hostess said it would be five minutes. From what we had seen, they were not busy and a lot of tables were not cleaned. We were the only ones waiting. It was 15 minutes until I decided to make an executive decision to sit at the bar to receive better service.  The hostesses never even apologized and we got a table at the bar. It took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come serve us. She apologized for the wait as well as for her coworkers which was very considerate of her. Then we ordered our drinks. We were in sight of the bartender on staff, who was not doing anything besides socializing. It was a $5 mimosa which was NOT worth your money it because it came in a champagne glass.  It took us 20 minutes to get our drinks and we even got our drinks AFTER 2 other tables that sat down after us. It was not our waiters fault, it was the bartender. Then we ordered our food and that took 45 minutes just to even receive it. The chicken was dry but I didn't want to say anything because that would take another 30 minutes just to get out a new plate.  I understand the fact if they were busy, but unfortunately, there was hardly anyone on that Sunday.  Once again the waitress apologized for the inconvenience. Nothing was the waitresses fault, it was those surrounding her. The whole time, I felt the  was a waste of time and we were not treated as guests. I was very disappointed and will not be coming to this particular store anytime soon. Pros: Attentive waitress, soups are delicious, Jack Daniel's sauce is a melt in your mouth treat Cons: Long wait time for everything you possibly do when going to a restaurant, chicken was dry, not worth the drink specials",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.248,2.36

The people around us had empty drink glasses and not one plate of food, so it wasn't just us. We were starving so we ended up leaving. Why wait for someone to come take a drink order 15 plus minutes and no telling how long the food would take. When we left the hosts had the audacity to ask us why we were leaving when they saw us the whole time without a server to come over. On top of all of this it was not even a busy day or during a busy lunch rush it was around 3pm. I can spend my time and money at another restaurant.

Anyway she did not assist me in finding alternative options nor did she bother to explain in detail what the other chicken dishes were on the menu. And she claimed that they could not make the sizzling chicken and cheese, even though the sizzling chicken and shrimp was on the menu so obviously all of the ingredients were in the kitchen. So I settled on the Jack Daniel's chicken. That jack daniels sauce is absolutely disgusting. My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese as a side, but was brought broccoli instead. By time his Mac and Cheese came out he was almost finished eating.  But the mash potatoes are still as yummy as I remember them and the strawberry lemonade is still tasty.  Meh, won't back. I'm super glad that we had a coupon for buy one get one free Entree because honestly that's all it was worth at best.   I should have just gotten the chicken fingers and fries, but I can go to any fast food drive-thru line and get that.

We both ordered burgers, I got the turkey burger with bacon and my friend ordered a beef burger well done. Our meals looked unpleasant and tasted disgusting. My bacon was burnt to a crisp and my turkey patty had an odd dry and old taste. My friend's burger was rare in the middle, and our fries were drenched in grease. After expressing our concerns to our nice waiter, he immediately gets his manager. The lady who was the closing manager on duty during our June 4th visit was very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional. She walked to our table without greeting us or apologizing for our dissatisfaction with the food. Her exact words were ""I heard you had a problem with the food"" and ""What's wrong with it?"" After showing her my burnt bacon, she points to my plate and responds, ""Oh that's it?... that little piece is the reason why you don't like your burger?"" My friend also explained how she asked for her burger to be cooked well done and the manager walks off in disbelief to reprint the order  ticket and accuses her of lying, while stating that our waiter input the correct order by writing medium well on the ticket. Again, there was no apology initiated. Instead, the manager tells us that she is not removing the food from the bill even though we did not eat it. She only offered us a 10% off discount from the bill. She also was so unkind enough to slam my debit card on the table as I reached to grab it from her hand.

74,Samuel B.,"Garland, TX",14,1,,5.0,2017-09-07,"I am an incredibly picky person when it comes to dining out. When I first visit a restaurant I search for the things that are wrong rather than point out the things that are being done properly. My first few visits here were sit down and dine experiences and they were lackluster at best. Average service from below average wait staff. I even took my mother here on her birthday and even that special occasion was all but ruined due to the poor quality of service. One day I decided to stop by on my way off from work and take a drink at the bar. This is when my mindset on this restaurant changed dramatically. Behind the counter was the bartender named John Beckham, and try though I might I couldn't find a single thing wrong with his service. His drinks were always made to the highest quality, he took an interest in my day, made personally sure that my food was brought out at high quality and in record speed each time. At the end of my first visit I knew I was hooked. I asked for his schedule and since then I have visited nearly every day he works and actively avoid the restaurant when he's not there. I thought my service couldn't get any better, but then as he saw I was a frequent flyer he would take extra care to keep up with my day to day life, have my drink ready and waiting for me at just the right time, and I hardly have to ask for my food when it appears before me as though he already knew what I wanted before I did. I can see he takes a genuine interest in all of his guests and cares for the quality of work he puts out at all times. He keeps up with current sports and events so that he can keep the talking points flowing during an evening of drinks among friends, and I have yet in the more than 50 visits to his bar had a single negative experience; He is the sole reason I return each and every day. He also has an impeccable degree of trust and discretion that any good bartender should. Imagine your favorite television bartender, like say from Cheers, yet magnify by a factor of ten. He always takes care of the guests at Bar Beckham and is made of a one in a million quality that can't be trained into someone or easily hired from the streets. He is real, mature, straight shooting, and brimming with integrity. I do not believe I would be returning, spending my very hard earned money, to this restaurant if it wasn't for the supreme and unmatched quality of service I've received from him on a daily and consistent basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

It was Saturday nite about 7 o'clock and the place was not very busy and this should have been a clue to what follows. I was seated right away but waited about ten minutes for the server to show up.  When I was ready to order he sat down in the chair across from me and took my order. This didn't bother me but it was a little different.   I ordered Onion soup and the Barbecue Ribs special. The soup arrived but it was only baby bottle warm. I ate most of it but wasn't please. I finally saw my waiter and waved him down and told him the soup was cold. To prove it was cold I told him to stick his finger in it. Which he did and he agreed that it was just warm. He took it back and said. No more  Next the ribs showed up with coleslaw and some onion rigs. I took my knife to cut up the ribs. I had a hard time getting through the outer crust finally I cut through and the meat fell of the bone. This happened on all the ribs. So I ended up eating the meat with my fork. The quantity of meat was small, over cooked and tasteless. So you had to dip it in bbq sauce to moisten it so you could eat it. I ate the first half and brought the second home. I never saw any manager. In most restaurants if you're unhappy with a item a manager shows up to apologize, not here. The ""new "" onion rings were terrible but the coleslaw was great.  Guess I won't return for many like before",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
57,Van D.,"Plano, TX",11,21,3.0,5.0,2017-11-22,Jolene chilled my glass for my beer with ice just to make sure my beer was ice cold. I've been to many many MANY bars and never have I felt so warm and fuzzy about an ice cold beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
60,Robert H.,"Rowlett, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-11-26,"First negative review I've made... Horrible service, they sat us and forgot about us. They were NOT busy. Kept forgetting to bring drinks, no refills (except for a different waiter doing it once) our waiter disappeared for the most part and would reappear to randomly wipe off a table. Didn't get all the food we ordered, had to chase the waiter down just to pay. I'm not convinced the entire place is bad, but our waiter made it horrible. Won't be back. Friday's is now below Applebee's in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
58,Rob D.,"Rowlett, TX",1,66,17.0,2.0,2017-12-17,"Absolutely horrible service. Food took forever to come out. Waiter was absolutely clueless. Asked for tea refills...had to remind him. Asked for water, never delivered. Food was  mediocre. Won't be back. Not even that busy yet slow as Christmas. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
63,Amy C.,"Weatherford, TX",0,6,,1.0,2018-01-10,"Worst dining experience we've had in a long time.  This place desperately needs new management.  The three of us waited 20 minutes for our drinks.  Tea, virgin daiquiri and a smoothie.  The waiter was scarce and busy apologizing to all of his tables.  At first they said they needed to brew my tea and then said the bar ran out of ice.  After awhile I asked for ice water since they brought out appetizer (no plates though and short on flatware).  Waiter brought us ice water.  Funny how it DID have ice.   Brought nachos dinner out 10 minutes before other two dinners.  Had to send it back because they didn't bother to put any cheese on them.  Waiter even verified nacho order twice.  It was just beans and cheese!  The menus were never removed from table.  I can't make this up!  Horrible service all around.  Waiter tried to blame it all on kitchen, but his service was terrible too.  Saw a manager visit two tables near us with issues too while we sat there.  Took over an hour to get drinks and food and get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-garland,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
