12,Ricardo T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",75,226,17.0,1.0,2012-03-05,"I used to love TGI Fridays, and more than likely had I gone to the one up by my parents' house or the one up in State College this might have been a 4 STAR affair, however it is not and here's why: Right off the bat, the greeter might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying ""I Hate My Job, Possibly My Life, Ergo I am a black-hole destroying all signs of positivism"".  I had to open my own door, which isn't a big deal except HE WAS HANGING AGAINST THE OTHER DOOR.  Duuuuude, get out of the way if you're not going to open the door. The shame of it all is that I entered hungry the restaurant hungry.  So after the door debacle my spider senses are going haywire, further confirmed by being greeted with ""Is It Going To Be Just You Three?""  What?!  Who talks like that?  With a slow gait of a walk and a disconnected facial expression were taken to our table ... oh and it wasn't cleared.  We got an exasperated (oh yay signs of life!) ""hold on just kidding let me clean this"" and after about 5 minutes of him running around looking for a ""rag"" as he asked the wait-staff, we sat in a lysol-like smelling table--heck! at least it was clean. Now the purpose of this trip was simple.  Get an appetizer, eat only half, then indulge in one of their larger desserts.  Well at this point the whole just being seated experience had thrown me for such a loop that I wasn't hungry.  I got their potato wedges...usually a pretty safe bet...but WRONG.  Apparently loading them with cheese cuts too much into profit margins or something because it was potato plus a table spoon of cheese and a table spoon of bacon bits.  So a tad on the bland mostly potato side of things. Our waiter/server/dude was more alive than the greeter, score!  But still the entire staff just didn't seem be all OK with being at work, which heck I get it, but in the service industry you suck it up and move on. In the end I was so bummed that I skipped dessert and called it a night.  The whole thing was forgettable, so it might be a while before I return to Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
13,Jason M.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",3,29,,2.0,2012-10-17,"It is what it is.  A corporate joint with decent food.  They're a bit on the pricey side, but the food is better than your typical corporate place. Service was nothing special.   I didn't like how loud it was inside.  It made it hard to talk with your party. I don't typically like to go to these kinds of places because it feels like an even trade.  You pay the price, you get your food.  It fills you, but you're not better for it.  There's nothing here that makes you say wow. I'm not going to say it was a bad time, and I'm not going to say that I didn't enjoy my evening, but I'd rather be at a place that has a better overall value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
11,Kyle P.,"Wheeling, WV",3,2,6.0,5.0,2013-10-24,"As soon as I walked inside, my friend and I were greeted instantly with a smile and friendly conversation..  Our server was very friendly and polite. The appetizers were delivered quickly and tasted delicious. Check was pricey but you get what you pay for..  This is a restaurant you go to when you're trying to enjoy yourself and receive great food with friendly service. I would gladly come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
10,Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469.0,4.0,2014-04-04,"I was actually surprised to see that this location didn't have a good rating. After looking at some reviews, I realized most were older (only 1 being in 2013) We didn't have a bad experience at this TGI Fridays. We were greeted promptly by the host as well as the manager. The manager seated us. Bobby ended up knowing the host and stayed back and chatted with him for a second.  Our server was Dominic (although for some reason Daniel is also sticking in my head. I was recovering from a cold & filled with medicine so I can't remember) We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer. It was tasty. The chips had a refreshing lime taste to them. Each day of the week, TGI's has specials. On Thursday, it happened to be ""$3 Thursday"". Select margaritas (regular, strawberry or ""skinny blackberry"") as well as select appetizers were $3. Their daily deals seemed great. I also noticed entrees for around $10 on a certain day.. although I can pinpoint which day, sorry! Bobby ordered the regular margarita on the rocks and I ordered the strawberry. Our server mentioned mine came frozen, but he would gladly put the order in as on the rocks and actually recommended it that way. They were tasty!!  I ordered the sizzling chicken & shrimp entree. The chicken was tasty & laid in onions, red peppers & possibly a cheese sauce(not sure?) and the shrimp had a nice, little spice to them (to my taste buds, but i'm a weakling) It came with mashed potatoes which were extremely creamy & seasoned well. You can't always find tasty mashed potatoes! We left satisfied, except for the fact that we are making a daily habit of eating out- lol but that's our own problem, not TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
16,Jenna S.,"Rochester, PA",0,1,,1.0,2014-04-05,"Terrible service. We sat at the bar and waited a half hour for salads before our entree. Then when asked where our salads were, the bartender responded that he almost forgot that we ordered food. They weren't even that busy. We put our food order in at 8:15 and it wasn't even prime dinner time or a full bar. No excuse. After we got our dinner, neither bartender checked back to See if we needed anything. I needed a refill and my boyfriend needed ketchup. We never got it. After we finished, we had to ask for our check just to get out of there. Our enjoyable was terrible answer should have stayed at Longhorn and waited in line. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
7,Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",359,771,3128.0,3.0,2014-10-10,"Had lunch with girlfriend. They have lunchtime specials where you can pair a meal for a reasonable price. I had a coupon that entitled us to either 20% off meal or get one entree free with purchase of two drinks and an entree. We had French onion soup along with a turkey sandwich. Food was okay. Our waiter was kind and helpful but failed to tell us that the coupon doesn't work on meal specials. He did however, give us the discount to make up for the error. Food is okay and average. Great spot to go to for informal gathering of friends. Will come again next month and will abide by coupon rules.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
9,Jen B.,"Stratford, CT",54,142,360.0,4.0,2015-06-19,"Good value for an airport! Got the wedge salad which was delicious. Also the flatbread which was not very crispy but the flavour was excellentl. 10.50 for a 9 oz glass of nice wine. My 2 starters were 12 bucks total. In and out fast.  Super friendly service. I don't know everyone's name but Dante was my server. I asked to split my check *after* he'd already run the bill and he was all ""no problem!"".   Now I (finally!) know where I can go to eat when flying through Pittsburgh. So long, horrible ""the Burgh bar"" or whatever it's called.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
8,Sandeep P.,"San Jose, CA",44,132,33.0,3.0,2016-02-02,"Ordered the Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi. Requested for spicy & blackened just like it was shown in the picture in menu. But got it as if it was just boiled not well done. Asked the server to take it back & blacken it but he said it was all they could, and just added some seasoning to it. The beer however was nice & flavorful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
5,Mish R.,"Bethel Park, PA",48,9,2.0,2.0,2017-05-26,"Well Fridays,  I think we are going to go our separate ways.   Your food was good,  the service used to be good and the beer was cold,  however,  the last 3 visits to different locations have proven that it's not just a location issue it's a company wide issue.   We had horrible service today for a lunch and the fries were nasty.  It took the server over 10 minutes to even take a drink order.  I was seated without a kids menu and when I did get one,  no crayons.  That's not a deal breaker as I carry them with me.   Our food took an ok amount of time and was super hot.   We had the rib special and chicken fingers as well as kids mac n chs.  The fries that both my husband and I had were horrible.   Cold and mushy.  The manager was so busy running food we couldn't flag him down.   Our server never truly stopped at the table she only paused long enough for us to say any thing as she kept try to serve the other table more then us that was right behind us.  I honestly  felt like the ""red-headed step-child"" and was a huge bother to her.  Even trying to pay she never truly stopped at the table just tried to grab and run off until my husband said there was a striped reward written on there    She tried to say she didn't need anything but the phone  number, but my husband was trying to tell her there was a reward to redeem number written too.   I don't think they were under staffed as I saw many employees running around.  It seems as if a company wide training needs to happen since this seemed to be the same situation at all 3 locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
3,Jeff D.,"Hookstown, PA",73,63,39.0,2.0,2017-06-10,"Business looked clean and we were seated promptly. We did notice there were 3 staff sitting out front of the building smoking. Typically it's not fashionable to have three staff smoking at the same time. I assumed they were bored. We were seated and our waitress attended us within 5 minutes. We all order alcoholic beverages and they arrived within 10 minutes. We ordered  brownie sundae, a sandwich, and some sort of chicken appetizer. Food was good and without issues.  I did notice all of the waitresses and bartenders eating throughout our entire visit. They would be greeting customers with food in their mouth, chomping away. I found that to be very unprofessional. I also watched one bartender. Make a disguised cup of mixed alcoholic items that she sipped throughout her shift. It looked as if it was a peanut butter jar container or something similar looking. I always witnessed a male customer come up to the bar and have a shot with an employee who must have just got off duty, im assuming. The employee said it's on the house. I figure the franchise owners may want to address these issues. I wonder where the manager was?? I wish I didn't withers all of this because I would have rated it much higher however, the issues I noticed, although I'm unaffected, changed my perception of the company and how it's managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
1,Denise M.,"Oakdale, PA",21,23,9.0,1.0,2017-07-27,Worst experience ever in a restaurant.  I asked to be seat in the back away from the crowds because we had a party of 10.  After 15 minutes waiting in an empty restaurant we were told there were no servers working in the back.  It was 6:45 pm. On a Thursday ?? Really. ? So they seat us right smack in the middle of the aisle with not enough chairs for our party.  We got the eye roll from the server for asking for separate checks after she asked if we wanted them.  We waited a very long time for a drink order to be taken. Long story short. All orders we mixed up. He sever told me we were too loud and she couldn't hear us. So my 5 year old grandson waited 2 hours for a kids salad. Mandarin oranges. I order the black bean burger plain. Which had to be sent back. Because we have special food needs and there was cheese all over it.  Needless to say I had an instant stomach ache when I got home. And will never visit again.  The manager was clueless ‼,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
6,Ryan G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-10,"Went here for lunch today and it was pretty dead inside but still had to wait a little for a table. Me and the three guys I was with got seated and looked over the menu for 15-20 minutes before anyone came to wait on us. They apologized and said that they were ""very busy"" although there were maybe a total of 15 customers in the section we sat at. Most of which had already had their food. We put in for our drinks and food including one appetizer. the drinks came promptly but it took another 15-20 minutes to just get the appetizer. After this we decided to get our food to go because it was taking too long and we were on our lunch break. The waiter apologized again for them being ""very busy"" and when called out on it, because they were not busy at all, we in turn received attitude. When we got to work and started eating our food (which was cold by the time) we noticed that the very few fries that we each got were cold and stale. We will no longer be taking our business to this establishment. Especially after the horrific service that we had received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
4,Jason W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,6,,2.0,2017-11-20,"First and foremost..Horrible service. I witnessed a bartender curse out a customer for wanting to use a coupon. Our waitress kept forgetting items we ordered and got irritated when we asked for them. She then proceeded to never check in with us after the food came out. I saw her sitting in the waiting area texting on her phone. There was a family sitting across from us who the waitress treated poorly also. Positives...the food was great. Unfortunately because of the service, we won't come here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
0,Kaysi S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,8,9.0,4.0,2017-11-25,"Ordered: The really good burger The burger was pretty good, juicy. The flavors are there. Their mixed drinks are well mixed. Definitely a tryout spot. Service is fairly nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
2,Paula D.,"McKees Rocks, PA",35,6,6.0,1.0,2017-12-09,"Very dirty establishment. Had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, there are about 20 tables (at the very least) empty. When I asked why there was a wait, The hostess said the wait was due to the kitchen, not seating. The pictures I posted are from the surrounding tables around my husband and I after 10 minutes of us already seated. The prices are just as high if not higher than a steakhouse. Need I say more? The food was dry. Ribs seemed like they were a day old. I've been waiting for a water refill for 15 minutes. The waitress asked how my food was, I replied that it wasn't that good, she said she sorry and walked away and I haven't seen her since. I'm really disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crafton,,,,,
