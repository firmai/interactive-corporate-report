15,Kevin H.,"Zelienople, PA",0,5,,1.0,2014-05-04,"i was there to have lunch with my wife and the food was very disappointing. the steak was completely tasteless and the fries were rubbery. felt like they were cooked a day before. The server was not friendly at all and ignored us the whole time.Food arrived late and bad service.i dont remember the server's name. but it starts with a ""j"". will never be back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
14,Ricardo S.,"Observatory Hill, Pittsburgh, PA",4,23,92.0,3.0,2014-05-17,"Came here with my family for dinner after a day of sitting in bleachers at a TKD tourney, and I will say dinner was good. For a chain, the food was prepared as ordered, the server 'Lizzie' (a recent Pitt grad) was friendly and the price was appropriate. At our table steak was king. Both of my kid carnivores had 4oz steaks and baked potatoes (at $5.49 each).The steaks were cooked to specifications, and came out tender w/o a lot of gumminess or fight for my sons. The potatoes were hot and steamy and their beverage of choice milk, frosty and refreshing. My wife and I rounded out the steakfest w/ 8oz servings, hers butterflied and cooked well well done, and my steak medium rare. My steak was cooked to the point that it needed very little work to ingest,  mushrooms and onions dressed the steak and if I must say, it was dressed to impress and needed very little A1 steak sauce.  My baked potatoes was moist YET flaky disappeared rather quickly. Our waitress was intuitive and kept a steady 'stream' of drinks flowing. All in all the main course was okay. No complaints. We rounded dinner off w/dessert and my triple chocolate meltdown left ALOT to be desired. The cake portion was chalkie tasting and the fudge center cold at worst, room temp at best. Will I eat there again sure. Will I have that. Same dessert. Never.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
12,Jason A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,12,,1.0,2015-08-20,"Why is there a tiny flatscreen at my table?! I don't want a constant advertisement right next to me. Killed my appetite. Why advertise crappy food? A good idea would be to give your cooks a raise. Horrible corporate idea!! I love it, instead of paying actual chefs, or giving your guys a raise, they'll spend thousands putting a constant advertisement at your table. Way to go down hill!! Apparently you don't trust your servers either, they will tell your guests what's best. Nothing says screw the employees more than a constant advertisement at the table!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
6,Colin M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",109,299,87.0,4.0,2015-10-22,"I grew up with Applebee's back home. It was one of the first chains outside of Eat'n Park I went to in a regular occasion. I don't get here as much as I used to by any means, but as of late we've been using their Carside to go, so my review is for this service. Three main reasons I've gone back twice: the price, the service, the promptness. Applebee's, like most chain restaurants have done a good job over the years to keep their prices down with $10 meals and 2 for $20 offerings. Every time we come here I feel that we got a good deal. Using Carside to go has been a pleasant experience. They seem to put some of their best employees working this section and they've all been incredibly nice. Even better, they focus on your food being exactly ready at the time you selected. That way when you get home it's as fresh as it can possibly be. I'd recommend you give it a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
7,Kathy B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",16,34,3.0,2.0,2015-12-30,"Operating at the speed of SSSSLLLLLOOOOWWWWW!!! We had a sandwich, burger, boneless wings, fish and chips and a steak.  An hour and half later it came.  We were so hungry that we didn't really taste the food.   I  was just ok.  Except when the potatoe was cut in to it was still uncooked.  The manager said "" yeah, are potatoes are an issue"".    There are so many other options in the area, this won't be on the go back to list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
13,Aisha W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",54,21,25.0,1.0,2016-01-17,"Just horrible!!!! 1st time at this location. Ordered a sangria, which was good! My sister & I both ordered the bourbon street chicken. After waiting a while our food finally comes out. My sister's is perfectly cooked while mine us clearly burnt! I cut a piece off to see if it tasted burnt & it did. They threw a whole bunch of seasoning salt on top of the burnt chicken trying to hide the fact that it was burnt. I told the waitress ir was burnt & I'd like another. The waitress said she will send the manager over, 10 minutes go by still no manager so I asked the waitress where's the manager. She seemed surprised she didn't come over. Finally the manager comes over, not to apologize for serving me burnt chicken, but to tell me that they are making me a new one. I was very disappointed in how the manager handled the situation with no apology!! The waitress asked if the manager came over, I too her yes, but she didn't do anything or apologize. So a little later the manager comes back over to apologize. I would not look forward to returning to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
9,Bill E.,"Brentwood, PA",85,13,,1.0,2016-03-29,Don't go stay away worst experience have had not worth the frustration.they must need a recipe to make water doesn't anyone bus dirty dishes any more,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
11,Scott H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-29,"Went there for dinner - horrible.  The wait-staff clueless.  The appearance - awful. Dirty tables left unbussed.  It took 5 mins to be spoken to by the server. And when he did come around, I asked for Iced T and my friend asked for water with lemon.  After 5mins still nothing - so we walked out.  I called the store and the manager (female) acted like nothing was wrong. The restaurant was slightly busy but there was no wait. I should have know by the overall appearance - many tables dirty.  Patrons looking upset for one reason or another (could be heard walking to the table and once seated).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
10,Ryan H.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,3,,2.0,2016-05-21,"The waitress forgot our silverware and straws until halfway though the meal. The menu was very overwhelming, repetitive, and very disorganized. The food was very salt. I had the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken. The mac and cheese was soupy(very watery), and the fact that the chicken was in the mac and cheese made the chicken soggy. There was also random food bits in the mac and cheese. Things like beans, hunks of bacon, burnt slices of bacon, slices of what appears to be onions, and ?basil?. The waitress and staff were very nice though, despite their apparent rushing around. The staffing seemed to be jumping around filling different positions. I saw hostesses frequently balancing the hostessesing and returning the dishes to the kitchen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
8,Lisa M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",43,17,5.0,4.0,2016-09-21,I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. First off we had one of the best servers in that restaurant his name was Daniel and he was so bubbly and willing to help anyway that he could. Great job makes me want to continue to have him as our server. Now the downfall the food has way I mean way to much sauce for anyone's liking easy on the sauce there. Other then that very very pleased.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
3,Aj S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",256,193,571.0,2.0,2016-11-30,"I'm not one for chain restaurants, but on a Monday weeknight after 10pm, you're choices are limited. This is why we decided to go to Applebee's. I never really had an issue with them before, but I'd just rather spend my money somewhere local instead.  Service was shaky. Our waitress was nice, but seemed a little nervous. Maybe she was new? There also weren't many tables and it seemed to take her quite some time to check on us and refill.  The food is where the two stars come from. We ordered tacos as an appetizer. No problems there. My boyfriend and I both ordered the steak. Now, granted, its Applebees steak, but it was very gummy tasting. Texture was strange. I ordered a baked potato which wasn't even warm and fully cooked (I noticed another table had the same issue) and garlic green beans that were lukewarm and soggy. My boyfriend wasn't impressed with his sides either.  I will say, you get lots of food for the price. An appetizer, two salads, four sides, two steaks and a beer came to be around $45 after tip. Then again, I guess you get what you paid for. Needless to say, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
2,Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",51,78,62.0,3.0,2017-03-25,"Applebees is always good for a quick bite to eat without having to go to a fast food restaurant. I ordered the side salad which one of the better side appetizer salads. It includes bacon, cheese, cucumber, tomato, and croutons. For dressing I ordered the honey balsamic which isn't as good as their old hot bacon dressing but it's pretty good. My main meal I ordered one of the lesser calorie dishes, the cider grilled lemon chicken with rice cranberries apples and quinoa. It was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
5,Catherine C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,52,7.0,1.0,2017-05-05,"My husband and I came here for a quick meal.... not so quick. We weren't expecting the red carpet rolled out for us, but from the time we sat down until the time we left the service was terrible. Our waiter appeared to be very overwhelmed, or just miserable, and scatterbrained. Everyone that worked here looked miserable. Our chips were stale for our appetizer, and it took ten minutes to get a drink refill. Our waiter actually commented out loud about a poor tip he received from the table next to us (he didn't get their order right and was not attentive at all). The fire alarm even went off when we were here and the manager said nothing. It appears they need better customer service and maybe a little more time spent on the food. Probably wouldn't come back here unless everywhere else on McKnight road burned down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
1,Chassidy K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,6,13.0,1.0,2017-08-27,"They just have terrible service. The managers do not know how to run the store, two years ago the store was all right. The restaurant had OK food for an OK price, but now they don't. The food cost over $10, which I understand the restaurant has no Way to change that. But the way the manager handles the restaurant, is very poor. The kitchen is always filthy and loud, and the service overall just isn't good. The only benefit, is if you complain about the food, most of the time they will either pay for it or get you a new dish. But I'm pretty sure they are told to do that by their bosses. Other Applebee's are much better than this location on McKnight road. Just go somewhere else is what I would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
0,Krista B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",48,31,104.0,3.0,2017-08-31,"Always come here as well to eat if we don't feel like going anywhere else. I'm used to coming here so nothing super special about the setting. I do like that they have the to go pick ups at the back with it's own separate door so the people that are actually dining in won't be disturbed.  We normally get the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 deal, but this time we didn't. We got regular meals for once. I got the mac n cheese and my mom got a burger. Both meals look good. Mine tasted good, but after awhile the honey sauce was making me a little queazy. The burger was good (according to mom). She was craving a burger and it satisfied her craving. We did not get dessert before we left. Our waiter was pleasant and was very prompt with ordering our food. Usually we wait some time.  Over all - we will all be back because it's an everyday family restaurant with a bar in it for games or to just hang out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
4,Katie B.,"Carnot-Moon, Coraopolis, PA",12,3,,1.0,2017-10-04,"Do yourself a favor and stay far away feom this Applebees. I ordered a Pepsi and it was flat. The server got me another one, but stated that their soda is always flat and she won't even drink it. We got the beer cheese and pretzels for an appetizer and received dried up cheese (microwaved) and there was seriously only enough cheese to cover the bottom of the bowl. I sent it back only to receive a second bowl that was watered down and more like soup. When our dinner arrived the middle was hot and around the edges were cold. (It was pasta) and probably microwaved as well. I took mine home so I could heat it at home. I'm never going hack to this place. It is horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-18,,,,,
