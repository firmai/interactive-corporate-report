Shari F.,"Kaysville, UT",9,66,13,3.0,9/21/2014,Applebee's are the same pretty much everywhere.  We always get good service at this location.  I'm leaving the review to say that the Cross Cut Ribs suck!  They are 80% bone with little tiny bits of meat.  They were all you can eat which is good because we needed to eat a LOT to get a decent serving of meat.  It was not worth the effort.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Jason W.,"Pleasanton, CA",6,17,,4.0,3/21/2015,"Service was a little slow, but overall we got the same standard Applebee's service, price, atmosphere, etc that we would expect from Applebee's.  Food was good.  Annoyed to have to be carded by the server and the manager to have alcohol, but hey, this is Utah.  Lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Si Tiny E.,"Layton, UT",3,18,,5.0,8/7/2014,toni has always provided exceptional warm and friendly service.  Good food and fantastic service from toni is like hand in glove....always a great family night out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Adam V.,"Layton, UT",161,25,41,3.0,5/8/2014,"Good place for a big group, always come with a lot of friends after a performance. It's better to plan ahead and let them know a big group is coming so they aren't under staffed. Sometimes the service sucks, other times it's great. Food is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Andrew H.,"Layton, UT",72,145,29,1.0,3/12/2011,"My wife wanted to try Applebees' again after a few years of not eating at one.  It was a horrible meal overall.  We went their for the two for twenty deal.  We got boneless buffalo wings which were somewhat overcooked.  Then my wife had the bourbon chicken with shrimp and I had pork ribs and  fries.  The seasoning on our food was horrible and the chicken of my wife's dish was uneatable.  The fries were seasoned too much and the pork was hard to eat with the flat bones all throughout the meat.  I highly recommend going somewhere else for dinner.  Applebees' is just a horrible place to eat.  I remember when it was better when it was new in Utah, but it sure has gone down in quality.  Applebees' commercials make it look a ton better than reality.  1 star because the service was OK and the appetizer was eatable for the most part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Tom I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",148,1294,2012,3.0,9/20/2010,"Used this place for biz dinner, sinc ethe guests waned ""American food"".  Exactly what you'd expect from applebees. They are okay, nothing special. Service was somewhat hit and miss, drink order was quick but check took forever to come to our table, getting our guest nurvus as they had a conf call at hotel.  Overall, this is just an applebees. there are other options out there in the same area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20
Tee L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,196,3,3.0,6/25/2009,"This is Utah and found no real Happy Hour??? Drinks at full price, but 1/2 price on certain apetizers(9p to closing M-th).. Service is decent.. Food ok for something just above fast food..These Applebees' in Utah are very different than the ones in California,much pricier and happy hour restricted hours..  Their web site doesn't note any restriction,plus the Applebees(CA) are the better ones to go to ,as the happy hour drinks are $3.00 on happy hours drink and certain selected $3.00 apetizers.. While in Utah I spend my money elsewhere.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2?start=20

Rose H.,"Sun Valley, NV",36,1,,5.0,12/27/2017,"Applebees  the friendly happy atmosphere...made our visit a great delight. The food was very tasty. And sizzling as it was served.  Our Server Tyson , had a bubbly personality that lit up the restaurant. I give a high five to the professionalism and cleanliness of the place. Great place to eat and relax after a hard days work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
ShayBree P.,"Clearfield, UT",85,4,,3.0,12/6/2017,"I love their Chinese chicken salad I get it or their pasta every time.

Jim H.,"Layton, UT",92,127,327,4.0,11/9/2016,"I'm generally not high on the franchise cookie cutter restaurants, but I really love Applebee's new menu.  I'm a bit perplexed by the recent reviews of the Layton location.  Perhaps because we were there for lunch instead of dinner?  Not sure. I do know that we enjoyed our visit.  Our server was friendly and engaging, and helpful with recommendations.  One of the other servers also stopped by Nd chatted with us twice.  The service was fast, and the food was excellent!   I had the Bourbon Chicken skillet. It came out piping hot.  Tons of flavor, perfect char on the chicken, and the potatoes were awesome!   But as good as my meal was, my wife picked the winner.  But what can I say?  She's good at picking winners!    She went with the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken, which was outstanding,  she was nervous about the gravy, so she got it in the side.  Very light, tender chicken fried chicken on a bed of chunky yet creamy mashed potatoes.  Fantastic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Steve K.,"Commerce City, CO",29,124,157,2.0,2/1/2017,"I know Applebee's have many reviews, but this review is specific to this location.  Soup: French Onion Soup ($2.99).  A medium-sized crouton with a little cheese on top.  French Onion Soups should have the entire bowl topped with cheese.  Worse, the broth was plain and didn't contain much onion.  Poor choice.  Entree: Thai Shrimp Salad ($10.49).  About 8 grilled shrimp with wonton strips, shredded cabbage and lettuce.  The Thai peanut sauce was mostly absent.  Sorry, but another swing and a miss.   Drinks: - Vodka Martini ($5.19).  Don't let the price fool you.  They charge $4.99 for 1 shot of Tito's Vodka and $0.20 to shake it and put it into a glass.   I should have just ordered the shot--my expectations were higher.   - Fat Tire Beer ($7.00).  A large pour and a MUCH better value! Service: I sat at the Bar.  A young lady greeted me, and I gave my drink order.  She said she couldn't make an alcoholic drink, so I needed to wait for the other Bartender.  Weird.  Still, I waited another 10 minutes for the actual Bartender to take my drink--and by that time--my food order.  Afterward, she was attentive, so I am giving them an additional star (up from 1 star).  Ambiance: It's an Applebee's, so you know . . . They're all the same.  Overall: I spent $28 for a meal that was not inspiring, not interesting, and not worth my time.  Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Devon M.,"Smithfield, RI",71,1,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Stopped in tonight with my fiancee and had a fantastic meal. Katie was our server she was so sweet, excellent, fast, attentive, and personable.

Mandi A.,"Boise, ID",67,136,169,1.0,3/28/2017,"Well they recently released new menu items, which had people talking, and I thought it's been a long time since I've been in an Applebees...so why not! I was recently on a road trip (long 9 hours) and needed to stop to watch the Mens Elite 8 games(no road trip will keep me from the tournament..haha). Applebees was right off the Interstate so we decided to stop. Our table tried the spinach and artichoke cavatappi, the chicken mac and cheese, the pretzel bites and the chicken caprese. It was the general consensus of the table that all the food was just blah! These are all the new menu items...and not a single one would we order again. It's been my opinion for quite sometime that this chain is going down hill, and unfortunately eating there the other day didn't change my mind!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2

Brian L.,"Clinton, UT",41,6,1,4.0,4/7/2017,"Had a great time here!  Our server was excellent and on top of everything. Never had an empty cup and all of the food was cooked exactly as requested.  Not too much can usually be said about chain restaurants, but the service sets it apart and our server, Denise, was excellent!  Definitely worth checking out if you haven't been here in a while.

Boom P.,"Layton, UT",5,75,12,1.0,3/29/2017,Service was goodish.. Food was good till the end just so happen the last bite had a hair in it. It was blonde I have long black hair my other half no hair.. Remedy this? Nope. Food was and is still lacking in flavor. Ordered the steak and potatoes. Nothing special too much Brown gravy. The chicken and lime rice didn't have the amplified flavored. Lets just say I go here because of friends and that's it. Not my favorite place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Peggy C.,"Layton, UT",30,95,49,5.0,4/8/2015,"The cedar grilled lemon chicken is so good.  It's a new item on the menu and its a winner! There are actually several new menu items so the variety is good without being overwhelming.   The brownie here is gooey goodness.   Very affordable to eat here and the service is always good.   You have to try to Kobe meatballs for the appetizer, flavorful and a nice change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Martin G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/20/2017,"I now I'm in Utah but the beer thing was just weird here. They have Lagunitas IPA on the menu. They have a bottle of Lagunitas IPA on display the bar. They don't serve Lagunitas IPA at this Applebee' s. The beer thing aside, this is not the best Applebees's I've been to  in the chain.  The service was slightly off.

Cindy S.,"Layton, UT",163,52,23,2.0,3/22/2016,It would be better if the music did not force you out of the place.  This has to be the worst music ever.  The little machines on the table are so impersonal.  We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Stacie C.,"Kapolei, HI",0,8,2,2.0,5/8/2016,"Not sure what is going on with the Layton Applebee's but they really need to get their act together. This used to be one of my family's favorite places to go, but 50% of the time over the last 4 months they get our order wrong, or the food is over/under cooked. Not sure why I keep going, last night I got take out and the whole entire order was wrong!   Makes me sad, I hope things start to change",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Tena C.,"Syracuse, UT",45,268,819,4.0,6/11/2015,"We tried the appetizer special where you get five to try.  We got the brisket nachos, fried green beans, pretzels with beer cheese dip, pot stickers, and Italian meatballs.  All of them were good, but my favorites were the pretzels, green beans and pot stickers.  This a good sampler if you want to snack on a little of everything.  The service was friendly and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Marshall H.,"Cedar City, UT",86,6,,4.0,12/19/2015,"The restaurant was busy, even for a Saturday night, but we got dat immediately, and had drink orders taken moments after. Our server, Chris, was in top of absolutely everything, hands down one of the best servers I've ever had. They have TVs all over the place to entertain, and instead of showing sports, the presidential debate took the screen. Food was good, not spectacular for the price though, roughly 12$ per entree. Appetizers here are so good and they are always looking to spice up the menu. All in all, great experience. 4/5 because price did not match quality. Great restaurant, great staff, good food, great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Walter C.,"Layton, UT",11,194,21,4.0,11/12/2014,"Chris went out of his way to be helpful.  My wife had looked forward to a certain menu item, only to discover it had been deleted from the menu.  He spoke to the chef and was able to get him to make it again just for her.  Yep, he worked for that tip. Over all, the meals were good.  My only concern is that a number of the menu items tend to be some what bland in taste.  Of course, that does keep the sodium levels down on the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Raymond H.,"Clinton, UT",10,31,,2.0,1/20/2015,"We received a gift card to Applebee's for Christmas and decided to make use of it tonight. It was after dinner time and before half priced apps. The place was empty. I can't really complain about the service. Our server was attentive and tried to put on a smile. We ordered a Trio appetizer, each of us got a main dish, I got a salad and my wife had soup. My wife asked about the French onion soup and it was recommended. She certainly wishes it wasn't. It looked awful and tasted just as bad. The was either bad or mediocre at best. Nothing was good. I wouldn't have wanted anything else I saw come out either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
George S.,"Kaysville, UT",0,6,,1.0,4/15/2016,Seriously get your shit together. Ive been sitting here for an hour and the only time that we have seen a waiter is to seat us. We finally resorted to usuing the tablet to order our food and somebody brought half of our order and left without a word. Now we're just trying to get out of here and we cant get a bill. Seriously worse experience ever. When i stopped a waiter to ask what was going on she tried to blame it on us for using the tablet. This is beyond ridiculous. Never again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
Jbj P.,"Syracuse, UT",10,2,,2.0,7/4/2015,This place seems to be hit or miss from food to service.

Josh M.,"Sandy, UT",2,9,9,2.0,4/29/2015,"My sister is having a birthday dinner with her husband and friend at Applebee's tonight. I thought it would be nice to surprise her and pay for their meal. Upon calling the store and talking to a manager I was informed they will not take a credit card over the phone. I'm confused. In my business I take credit cards over the phone all day when people buy products as do half the other businesses in the nation. Why couldn't they use discretion, ask my billing address or even ask me to send a picture of license with my card to confirm I am who I am? Sorry Katy. That was your surprise. Surprise, there is no surprise. I think you should look at the policy and really run a risk analysis. Hundreds of restaurants allow for this and I'm disappointed Applebee's couldn't figure this one out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-layton-2
