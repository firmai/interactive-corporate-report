Ophelia M.,"Milwaukee, WI",1720,592,2050,4.0,12/27/2017,"I don't tend to come here for full fledged meals--but for cocktails and/or dessert, I'm definitely a fan. We've been to this location on a couple occasions now and have been pleased each time.  If you have a cheesecake lover in the family, this is your spot. Their cheesecake menu is vast and varied. In addition, their slices are ample (like whoa). So ample, in fact, that my main dining companion and I almost always share a piece (if we can agree on a flavor). When we don't share, we almost assuredly have some left over to bring home.  Their cocktail game is strong. My current favorite on their signature cocktail menu is their bourbon & honey. It's lightly sweet and made with Four Roses Bourbon, orange blossom honey, and finished with a sprig of thyme. If you've never had bourbon paired with thyme, let me be the first to tell you--they make an excellent combination.  We tend to sit in the bar area and have been more than pleased with the service we've received (kind, accommodating, and just plain friendly). We've always found the servers to be helpful and ready with recommendations when called upon. They're open late (midnight on Fridays & Saturdays) for those looking for a little late night dessert in a lovely atmosphere. Get to it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",14,73,47,4.0,11/7/2017,"I have visited several Cheesecake Factories but this one stands out to me. They always have good staff and is very conveniently located in the Bayshore Mall. Typically during rush hour there will be a wait (more on the weekends) but otherwise they seat you almost immediately.  Their bar has amazing drinks and I really like that they have a skinny menu for the health conscious ones. Their food choices are in abundance.. you can get overwhelmed because you would want to eat everything! I like how they break down their menu into seafood, or specialities and pastas and so on. I love their herb crusted Salmon and a few pastas. The new Thai coconut chicken is amazing! A must try.. it's a very flavorful entree. My husband often enjoys a pineapple or blueberry Mojito which they make really well!  Coming to the cheesecakes... isn't that the best part ? Assorted endlessly, their cheesecakes are one of the best. My favorite one is a caramel one called dulce and its to die for! So good! My mum loves the red velvet here and recently I saw a few new ones, amongst which mango key lime stood out to me.. mango and lime.. what not to like?  Unless you are allergic to a flavor, I highly recommend experimenting with your tastebuds here. You will not regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Michelle L.,"Racine, WI",82,1,,1.0,12/24/2017,"Worst overpriced food I've ever had in my life in a cheap, tacky ""Aladdin-like"" structure. I asked for hash browns with my eggs and received deep fried greasy potatoes served with catsup. Not acceptable. Orange juice was full of pulp and barely drinkable. Menu outside advertised ""brunch"". Was seated and found out ""brunch"" was brunch foods on a menu, not a serve yourself all you can eat. Menu is designed to confuse you. They do not make it clear what you'll be getting until it arrives. Stay away from here. Mediocre food that shows obvious corner-cutting. Not worth the extravagant price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Marian Q.,"Milwaukee, WI",143,121,149,4.0,1/29/2017,"As a broke college student, the Cheesecake Factory was my idea of fine dining. And as far as this location is concerned, I've never had a service issue and I've eaten in and carried out from here quite a few times.  Over the years, i have expanded my horizons but I occasionally find myself making my way back to the Cheesecake Factory because with their expansive menu there's always something for everyone. The way I have conquered their huge menu is to find one or two things that I like and I know are consistently good and stick with them. I have made the mistake of trying new things and have been mildly disappointed. Go for the chicken bellagio, the Jamaican black pepper chicken or a burger and you will not be disappointed.  Great place to go for groups- but make a reservation if you're going in over the weekend because it definitely gets filled with shoppers but the wait is a good time to do some shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Carter Andrew L.,"Hainesville, IL",5,4,3,5.0,10/29/2017,The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants while most are very packed and the waiters don't have much time to talk it's just in and out here they take time.The food was perfectly cooked not under or over cooked I got the almond cranberry salmon salad it was good it had a large amount of kale the salmon and abvacado eliminated some of the kale flavor overall it was stupendous,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3

Chadrick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",176,485,1320,4.0,1/4/2016,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. If you have a menu the size of a graphic novel, well that's more than plenty. The Factory has everything, literally. Despite it being a standard restaurant around the United States the fact that they have pretty much whatever you're craving, it can't be beat. Hands down the Bistro Shrimp Pasta is my absolute favorite. Happy Hour is prime to try a little bit of some of the apps. They have good deals on drinks too. I prefer the Bayshore as it is less busy than the Mayfair Mall location. Oh they have a million cheesecakes too! Can't go wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Mark P.,"Milwaukee, WI",258,285,532,3.0,6/27/2016,"The server was kind & thoughtful, my beverage was never empty which is basically a miracle.  But we go out to eat because food is delicious, much more so when you don't have to make it yourself & that is where I ran into some problems.  I ordered a burger off of their (way too) large menu.  So many choices.  When your menu has ads for other items, you need to trim it down a bit.  The server said it could be cooked to order & didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for medium / rare. After a moderate wait, the food came & I ate the French fries first because obviously fries lose that special something when they get cold, they are just never the same.  Then I cut into my burger & it is super well done. Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, & then come back to this dimension & check on us. I tell her about the burger & how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread & fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it was full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat & that she took away & just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over & starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée & that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full & it was unnecessary & it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée & fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  This location is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit? Nobody likes to wait thirty minutes for a check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
John S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,75,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Sometimes you have to go to the CF because its a group thing.  But that still does not excuse the moldy beet salad and then a manager who tries to explain to you that it is beet skin, not mold.  I know beets.  I know mold.  I know what I had was moldy beets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",64,409,712,3.0,6/22/2016,I really just don't get this place. For 18$ for 2 pieces of cheesecake with tip to go I was not crazed with the CF excitement. The cake is insanely rich and really is nothing mind blowing. We had the red velvet (nothing great-just approx 5lbs of sugar and tasted like most red velvet cakes I've had) and the oreo ( better than the red velvet but too rich and we love sweets). Staff is friendly and helpful but don't see myself or my mother visiting another. I'd rather have the 18$ in my purse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3
Carol T.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,18,,2.0,7/9/2017,"I've had otherwise good experiences with the cheesecake factory, however this location's service was inexcusable. I met a friend for a late dinner and the restaurant was nearly empty. We ordered water and 2 orders of lettuce wraps. After 40 minutes waiting for our food, our server (Trey) assured us it would be right up. Another 20 minutes passed with no sign of trey, a manager, or our food. I felt he was avoiding our table. When the food (lettuce wraps) finally did arrive more than an hour after we ordered, both Trey and the manager on the floor (Brittany) insisted it was delayed due to lettuce leaves not being prepared. I don't buy it. The manager never offered to compensate even a portion of our bill.  The food was ultimately tasty. Had the employees chosen to be honest and simply apologetically explained that the ticket was forgotten and quickly corrected the mistake - I would have been inconvenienced but satisfied. Instead, I left disappointed and angry with a story worth warning others about",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3

Georgina J.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",131,28,9,2.0,7/7/2017,"I made the mistake of getting their Cuban sandwich. The meat tasted like it was microwaved, which it probably was. The mustard tasted like it was Heinz. The sandwich had no flavor and was kind of gross. With how much their food is you'd think it'd be at least okay but it's a money hungry chain so I guess I shouldn't expect much.

Previous visits were ok at this location. Today wasn't. From the time I ordered until a salad came out was 30 minutes. Now I wasn't in a hurry but also wasn't looking to spend my day here either. Waiter came by once to say ""almost ready"". It's a salad for peets sake. Some lettuce and stuff on a plate. What did they do organically farm the stuff while you wait? Check came and my body language was so obvious ""wait and let me give you my credit card now"" but no, Capt oblivious disappears again for 10 minutes.  Epic fail this time.

Who doesn't like cheesecake at midnight. Salads are gigantic. Great place for poor students who want leftovers. This location like most is in the mall area.

Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,4.0,8/13/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I know it's a chain, and I know it is what it is, but there you go. Sometimes familiar is a good thing! The ceilings are high and the decor is pretty, giving you something to look at while you wait for your food. Like all Cheesecake Factories, your meal starts with a basket of bread. The honey wheat bread is always delicious, and is one of the best things about The Cheesecake Factory.  We started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms, which were stuffed with Fontina, Parmesan, garlic, and herbs and served in a wine sauce. They were delicious, and we kept dipping our bread in the sauce. We'd definitely order them again. My mother in law ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, which is chicken smothered in gravy and served with mashed potatoes, biscuits, and veggies. While it's not the best thing she's ever ordered here, she liked it well enough. My girlfriend ordered a factory combination with both Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon, which came with mashed potatoes. She love, love, loved it. I ordered my usual Chicken Madeira, which is chicken covered in a sweet Madeira sauce and topped with cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus. It comes with mashed potatoes as well. It's always delicious, and the sauce is amazing. Why order something else when this is perfect? And of course, we had to get dessert. My mother in law got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which is stacked layers of chocolate cake, cheesecake, and truffle cream. She loved it. It was so rich, she could only eat about half. My girlfriend ordered the Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores Galore cheesecake, and she loved hers too. It's Hershey's chocolate cheesecake topped with ganache, graham cracker pieces, and melty marshmallow. There was lots of marshmallow goo, which made her happy. I had the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, and it was really good. It's lemon cream cheesecake with lemon mousse and meringue, as well as candied zest on top. It tasted delicious but the presentation was horrid. The meringue was a melted hot mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3

The staff are usually nice as well. The waitress we had was kind of rude at first but as time went on, was nicer. There are plenty of food options. I got the Chicken and Avocado Club Sandwich and it was delicious. Now to the cheesecake (which is it's namesake after all), there are so many options it can be overwhelming! I decided to go with the S'mores cheesecake because it seemed unique. It was very rich but oh so good. Overall, I absolutely recommend that if you are in the area, that you check this place out, especially if you like cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3

David P.,"Cedarburg, WI",87,129,51,3.0,7/28/2014,"Been here a few times and almost every time I am extremely impressed by the portions of food that this place can dish out. The service was good but the one problem we had with this service was one of the family members ordered a martini or some kind of drink on the rocks. The drink literally had about 4 sips of alcohol and was around 80% ice. After saying something to the waitress, the manager game over and offered to get her another drink, which she ordered a beer. You'd think the beer would be free right? Wrong.... They were going to charge us for both drinks even though he gave the impression that he was getting a substitute drink for the 1/4 of a drink she had earlier.  So! If you go to eat, enjoy the food and get a beer, the drinks are overpriced for the lack of drink that you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20
Michelle R.,"Longwood, FL",35,72,160,4.0,7/29/2015,Very good service and surprisingly empty during the week. Coming from Florida if it's a Cheesecake Factory is always no less than a 30 minute wait on a good day. This location makes it easy to come with a group or for happy hour which is a fantastic deal.

Mostafa A.,"Milpitas, CA",85,2,1,1.0,7/4/2017,"Went to the Palo Alto University Avenue restaurant on 6/30/2017. Food arrived very late and the pasta was very overcooked. My total bill was $43 and being unpleased with the service, I did not leave a tip. 2 days later, I look at my bank statement and I see they charged me $55.

Brian F.,"Kansas City, MO",55,61,38,3.0,6/27/2015,"About what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  We were here on an idle Tuesday afternoon just after the lunch rush (around 2p) and it was completely dead. Service met my expectations but nothing more. She offered complementary bread, and every few minutes she popped over with ""bread is just coming out of the oven, should be right out"" which made me laugh. I mean, how many times can bread come out of the oven?! We ended up getting the bread pretty much with the food, half of which was stale/hard (the other seemed warm and fresh).  The menu is absolutely atrocious - 20+ pages, half of which is advertisements of businesses in other states (which makes me wonder if business is not going well?), and is organized all kinds of backwards. It's not an easy menu to navigate because things are spread out all over the place with full page ads in between.  The food itself was good and the Sangria my date had was actually very good. Prices were a little high for what you are getting but I don't think it's unreasonable. I think Cheesecake Factory has done a nice job of meeting (not exceeding) expectations as a big box store. I would prefer this to Applebee's or similar style, but I do feel there are places higher on my list to repeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20

Invisible, cosmic forces flow through several (overall) destructive industrial complexes & meet to pull something like The Cheesecake Factory through the membrane & into this Universe. I was very happily surprised by the falafel salad. Solid falafel & dressing. It was big & they don't skimp on the good stuff. I'm not used to being in places like this & the dominant paradigm radiation bath stuck with me for a bit, but I totally enjoyed the falafel salad. The service was great, too.

Angie O.,"Shorewood, WI",356,412,274,3.0,9/17/2013,"I've been here several times, and if I had to describe the Cheesecake Factory in one word it would be: overwhelming. I have always had good service here - the wait staff has always been friendly, but sometimes it does take a while to get the check. The food I've gotten has always been good, and the portions are very large so I feel you get your money's worth. But I personally feel that their menu is too large - they literally have everything. You want burgers or steak? They have it. Fish? They have that. Italian? Yep. Chinese/Asian-fusion dishes? Got that too. Normally I would love the variety, but CF goes a little overboard. I have never come here because I am craving a particular food or dish; I come here because I'm bored. As it definitely lies in the realm between expensive and cheap/moderately priced, and I am a very busy person, I don't frequent CF often. But the times I have been here it takes me and my dining partner(s) ages to decide what we want. I mentioned previously the food here is good, but due to the ginormous menu there is a lack of stand-out items. Everything I have ever had is the standard ""pretty good."" Cheesecake Factory's ""thing"" is the cheesecake. With this, I greatly appreciate the variety!! The cheesecakes I have tried have always tasted fresh and are delicious. But the vast majority run $7.95 + tax a piece. The pieces are large, definitely enough to split with another person. When I have a few extra dollars and have had a long day of working, I do like to splurge and get a piece for myself as an ""I can't believe I got through the day"" treat. I have to address the décor. Does anyone else feel like they've stepped into a Vegas casino upon entering the Cheesecake Factory? That could just be me... but I feel like its Caesar's Place meets The Venetian, which leaves me unsure of what look they are going for. And during the dinner rush it gets very loud. Perhaps I'd venture to CF more often if they offered some sort of happy hour special. They are definitely lacking in the specials department. And if they currently offer specials then it is not advertised very well! I'd recommend CF for picky eaters, because they would definitely find multiple dishes to choose from in their book of a menu. I don't recommend CF if you are short on time... or cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=20

Our waiter was friendly and social, the food was great, and surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for being one of the few places open. We only had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated!  My husband and I shared the dynamite shrimp, which were absolutely amazing, and for our main meals, I had the Southwest Chicken sandwich, while my husband opted for the Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich. My meal was delicious, but the bread was over-toasted, so it was fairly difficult to bite into. My husband enjoyed his meal, as well, except ""spicy"" is the last thing we would call the crispy chicken sandwich. Perhaps we just like our ""spicy"" to equal three alarm fire for our tastebuds.

Rae M.,"Little Chute, WI",0,14,3,4.0,4/11/2016,"This is 100% my favorite restaurant, hands down. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars: $$$. The prices of most entrees are ridiculous. The food? Amazing. I've ordered a number of different things on the menu, and have been impressed every time. (Would complain about the meatloaf, my husband's last meal there, the onions on top included the onion peeling..not good..but that's about it.) I guess, while I'm getting the negativity out, I was a bit disappointed, when they took the Thai Chicken Pasta off the menu. It was my all time favorite meal, but I'm sure it was removed for low demand reasons. I guess I can understand. People have complained about the menu being too large, but seriously people?! That just means they have variety! In appetizers, entrees, and desserts! People also have complained of wait time. This place is huge. Honestly, we've gone at peak hours once. Waited about 10 minutes for a table, and maybe 15-20 minutes for food. Any other time we've gone we've been seated immediately, and served promptly. This past visit, when we went at peak hours for restaurants, the appetizer was delayed. The manager ended up coming and apologizing for the mishap, and offered the app on him! It ended up coming out with our food (a little disappointing), but the customer service upon handling the situation was superb. He was very considerate and apologetic. Another day were there, we bought another table's meal. In return, our waitress covered our cheesecake! It was an act of kindness, which she definitely did not need to do, and it was an extremely generous and appreciated! The waitstaff is always polite and on point, with the way they serve. I love this place. I don't care if it's a chain. It's delicious, and the employees are great! I used to live in the area and ate there a lot.

Kevin R.,"Port Washington, WI",7,142,3,2.0,12/12/2015,"So, based on the food, this would be 3 stars, but I need to knock it down to 2 for the price and ridiculous menu.  If you have ever been subjected to their menu, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  20+ pages, 1/2 of which are ads, and a disorganized mess to boot.  Honestly, does this company even realize how stupid their menu is?  Anyways, the real gripe is the price... Now, The Cheesecake Factory has always been expensive, but it has gotten out of hand.  My wife ordered the ceasar salad with chicken - $16.50!...

She did not do a good job. We waited more than 1 hour and 30 minutes, as quoted. But somehow 2 seaters and 4 seaters are sitting before our large group. Granted we do have a group of 13 but that doesn't mean we should wait longer than quoted. And an excuse that ""we are waiting for customer to get up from their seat, sorry."" You can simply grab a table from a different section and add it. But instead you choose to wait for a table from that particular section to get up! Is it the users experience that matters the most or you convenience of setting tables up more important?! Just doesn't make sense to me. I'm humiliated and embarrassed that 3 ppl from our group had to leave bc the wait was dragging on too long! Either hire a new hostess with more experience or who has more intuition or give better training! It doesn't take a lot to recognize that a customer isn't happy, especially when they ask more than once when they can be seated! I know I can do a better job.

Nicole H.,"Milwaukee, WI",153,468,141,2.0,1/2/2013,"I always feel like the hosts here make way more of a production about seating people than it needs to be.  My last visit was about 8 pm on a weekend night and most of the restaurant was empty - despite that, my part of three stood at the host desk for upwards of five minutes while they decided and figured out where to seat us. I'm aware this had to do with figuring out which sections were still open and which servers were not yet cut, but the whole thing was way more difficult than it should have been and just kind of started the whole thing off poorly. It felt like they should be way more organized than they were.   To me, Cheesecake Factory tries to be everything to everyone and therefore is not really anything to anyone, if that makes sense. The menu is giant and overambitious and tends to mean that they do a ton of dishes ok, instead of doing a few dishes spectacularly. I usually find the menu overwhelming and have a hard time deciding on anything.  In the end I had some sort of chicken pasta that was fine, though it came with arugula and the arugula was kind of EVERYWHERE. I think it was meant for garnish (I hope), but it ended up in practically every bite and just so wasn't necessary. It was a warm dish - with random fresh arugula thrown on top. It didn't meld and it didn't enhance - it was just kind of wilty and in the way.  The only memorable part of the experience was the waiting awkwardly to be seated when there were tons of empty tables, which doesn't bode well for any of the food, you know?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=40

I don't know who our waitress or waiter was because there was over three people coming to our table. I lost count after the third person. I asked for something from one of them and never received what I asked for. My alcoholic beverage was tasty. Didn't really taste the alcohol though. I tasted more ice than alcohol. So I'm guessing the tasty part came from the strawberry that was adding to the glass. Joking. The drink was good even though it was lots of ice. Lastly, the cheesecake. The cheesecake was good.

When I placed my order I specifically asked to have the avocado remove (as I am allergic) after 45 minutes our food arrived. The first taco I did not see the avocado as it was at the bottom of the taco. Our server had not returned so I went to the greeter and asked him to get our waiter. The manager was present and prompt and very supportive. I guess what I am really thrown back by is when I paid for my meal, my bill was 22.07, I gave the waiter 40.07 and he gave me $8 back. I then informed the waiter that I had given him 40.07 and he laughed and said oh I'm sorry and gave me $10 with me telling him the amount. This was very suspicious and the straw that broke the camels back. I was satisfied with speaking to the manager and even more pleased that the greeter was nice enough to give me a soda to settle my stomach.

I would say that it's been nearly a year since I have last eaten here, and I was really looking forward to their green salad with their delicious blue cheese dressing that has, in the past, automatically come on the side, no request necessary. The salad had become one of my favorites because of the variety of fresh and flavorful greens, a wonderful combination of textures, flavors, and colors, just about exactly as seen here: what I got was a garnished up bowl of what might have been this: pre-dressed, just slathered with what, I will give you, is one of the best ever salad dressings. But slathered. Not on the side, as it had been every other of the dozen plus times I had ordered it. Had it not been for my love of the dressing, I might have quit after the first bite, but I admit, I had been so looking forward to that dressing that I soldiered on, until, a third of the way through, I realized I was not even enjoying the dressing. The server, Ricky, was wonderful, and when I explained my twofold disappointment to him, he was very solicitous and concerned. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go, and when the check came, there was no charge for the cheesecake.

A bunch of health challenges have changed our lunch planning, but we like to stop in from time to time.  The current day manager seemed to be great. You see she came to our table after I cancelled my sweet potato fries, having already waited 15 minutes for a burger. She explained that she would comp them. I replied that I was finished eating and didn't want them. She offered to give us a dessert. We thanked her and explained it wasn't necessary. Our server was very, very social. I am sure he thought that this constituted service. It doesn't. I told her that while he was a nice young person, he needed additional training. While we waited for 15 minutes, he visited many tables, kneeling at them and chatting up the customers. This might be a tip builder for some; for me it is annoying, especially when I am waiting for my food. I reiterated that we were fine and needed nothing comped. After our table was cleared, we again waited for our  bill. When it finally came, our server said he had asked the manager to comp my burger.

We started with the stuffed mushrooms small plate ($4.95), which featured six mushrooms stuffed with cheese.  Portion-wise, I wouldn't recommend splitting this among more than two people, but for us, it was perfect.  As an entree, I ordered the Chicken Di Pana ($13.50) -- lightly breaded chicken breast pan-fried friend and served over a white wine sauce and with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  As usual with the Cheesecake Factory, the portion was gigantic.  It was definitely delicious too.  I can't recall ever having something so tasty there.  My husband ordered the Steak Diane & Chicken Madeira ($19.99) combination plate and raved about the flavors and tenderness of the steak.  We both agreed we'd readily repeat these orders again in the future. And, of course, you can't leave without a slice of cheesecake.  Knowing we were taking ours to go anyway, we opted for one each, including a slice of the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake.  I don't remember the cost of these particular ones, but slices average around $7 and are large enough to feed a small village.  Tasty tasty tasty.  But who would expect any less from a place with Cheesecake in the name? Overall, our bill averaged out to around $62.  This wouldn't be our every day pick by any means, and we generally prefer local spots to the national chains, but this was a nice once-in-a-while treat, and I'm sure we'll be back again sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60
Nicole A.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,5.0,6/18/2015,"Food is AMAZING!!!! Obviously the cheesecake is to die for as well.

Traci P.,"Salem, WI",1,31,1,1.0,12/17/2014,"I called in advance to order 3 slices of cheesecake to go. We came in 20 minutes later to find our order had not been prepared.  Even though we called our order in advance we had to wait as long as people who had just come in to order, I don't understand the point of placing a telephone order if we could have walked in and waited regardless, they should have explained when we called that placing orders in advance was only a courtesy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60
Jen L.,"Greendale, WI",0,22,,5.0,7/30/2014,Fantastic service from beginning to end every time we come here. We always get BBQ pizza. It always seems to be old dough. The gluten is breaking down and the pizza is doughy. This doesn't happen as much at Mayfair. Overall a decent experience. If you are here for the cheesecake and you like tiramisu get the dessert instead. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake always makes everyone happy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60
Rita B.,"Schaumburg, IL",22,150,31,4.0,9/10/2011,"Working late around Milwaukee leaves one with very few options for good, sit-down, late night dinners. Luckily, Cheesecake Factory was open! I travel to WI for work once a week so hotel food is yuck.  My server was Lea (think that's how you spell it). She was not only very friendly but she was hilarious! Great recommendations (even though I've been to CF sooooo many times). Half way through dinner, Lea's shift ended so Nicole was my new server. She too was awesome!  Now, on to the food...I had a new item on the menu. It is called ""Mac and Cheese Burger"". Let me just say that it was DELICIOUS!!! It was so good and filling. I didn't touch my fries and was only able to conquer half of my burger.  I don't know how else to encourage someone to try this burger except that  YOU GOTTA TRY THIS BURGER! It's the bomb diggity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60
Bao Y.,"Maplewood, MN",28,49,34,3.0,8/4/2014,"The mister and I decided to eat here for our date night, and it was national cheesecake day so all slices of cheesecake were half off, score! There was quite a wait so we got our little buzzer and went outside to enjoy the fresh air, after about 30 mins we were seated. I had the tomato basil pasta, the portion was ginormous, well a lot more pasta than I could ever eat in one sitting. The chicken on the pasta was a little dry and lacking in any flavor but the pasta noodles were perfect and the combination of the basil and tomato was delicious. The mister had some steak and chicken combo plate with mashed potatoes. The potatoes were my favorite part of his dish, super buttery!! The steak and chicken were smothered in some mushroom sauce which I thought was just a way to cover up the lack of flavor from the meat. But even with all their food options the Cheesecake Factory is supposed to be better known for the cheesecake right? Sadly we were too full to order more than one slice which was the 30th anniversary cheesecake with chocolate cake, it was delicious with fresh whipped cream, and it was a ginormous slice, but I don't know if I'd regularly want to pay $8 for a slice of cheesecake, good thing we got it for half that price, and it was date night. Our waiter was nice but very busy, and only came back a few times to hurriedly ask us if we needed anything, which is fine since it was so busy. Overall, I'm too cheap to pay the prices for the food here that I feel I can make myself at home, and more to my liking. Sorry no pictures this time, forgot my phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60
Julie O.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,24,,4.0,10/28/2013,We love the Cheesecake Factory at Bayshore! There is a huge variety of menu items to choose from....even with a group everyone can find something they like. The portions are enormous so I usually solve that problem by ordering an appetizer. And I always take a slice of cheesecake to go....which keeps me in dessert for two or three days! I like the consistency.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=60

Roberto R.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,37,,4.0,6/21/2014,"Consistently good food, they even have a gluten free menu, and the cheesecakes, insane variety, always hit the spot.  Portions can be a bit ridiculously large, especially with the salads, but better too much than not enough, plus you can take it home.  I've had very good experiences there.  The one thing that bothers me is that they don't take reservations after 5pm if I recall correctly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=80
Brad E.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,338,91,3.0,11/8/2011,"The ambience is like a fancy Egyptian inspired and Vegas-type atmosphere. We came for drinks, appetizers and desserts.

Chris S.,"New York, NY",5,101,,1.0,11/13/2012,"I am not really sure what the appeal is with a place like the Cheesecake factory.

Joya W.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,24,,3.0,5/21/2012,I've been a few times. The service is average.  The decor is average. The food is delicious but I've had better. My favorite is the 4 cheese pasta.

Noabeth S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,16,,2.0,5/10/2015,"Thank god this place has good cheese cake because everything else is pretty bad. We recently went to the one at bayshore and we will not be coming back. The fact that the menu is 10 or so pages long shows that the meals won't be anything special. We started off with the tex mex eggrolls which were actually better then the entree itself. We then split a full size pasta dish, which was nothing special and could easily whip this up at home, which says something because I suck at cooking. The cheesecake did make this trip worth it, the mango slice was very good. So the food was disappointing and to top this off - our server was HORRIBLE. She had trouble with any serving tasks. She asked us multiple times in a short amount of time if we were ready to order, we can't look through a 10 page menu in 3 minutes. She only told us the specials after we asked. We had to ask for our water to filled 3-4 times. She also brought our entrees out when we weren't even half way done with our appetizer. We also noticed she completely screwed up the tables order next to us. The hostess was more pleasant to us then she was. Bad food and incompetent servers. We would give it one star if it wasn't for the good cheesecake. Also this place has very ugly decor and the whole building is just very strange and does not look good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=80

Susan T.,"Oak Creek, WI",1,27,3,2.0,1/3/2010,"My kids loved it when we went there and can't wait to go back. I told them for the amount of money we spent, it would be awhile before we all go back. The service was OK, even though we noticed that people who arrived quite awhile after we did, had their orders taken first. The cheesecakes all look delicious, but they are so expensive that I don't think they are really worth getting after having a meal there. I think the next time I would go, it would just be for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=80
Eli M.,"Milwaukee, WI",15,15,,2.0,11/21/2009,"SUPER overpriced, service is not horrible, but nothing to remember, food is not really very good. Definitely not even the best chain food at Bayshore, it's possible that Applebarf's is better. Lower the prices by 50-60% to bring them in line with the quality of food served.  Desserts can be awesome if you pick the right one, but 2 pieces of cheesecake would cost more than dinner at a restaurant that serves 2x better food.  For some reason the CCF under the Hancock tower in CHI is 2x better than any of the mall stores I have been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-3?start=80
