0,David K.,"Webster, NY",23,26,,3.0,2012-02-03,"Update: in the past week or so, they've extensively redecorated the restaurant, ditched the walls full of sports memorabilia, and softened the relentless music and lighting. Has Applebee's grown up? The atmosphere is improved, and you can carry on a conversation without shouting across the table. There are more big-screen TVs with hockey, basketball, etc. than in the past. Not sure how LCD screens have become a necessity in restaurant decor -- and heaven forbid one of them should show something other than a sporting event.  Menu hasn't changed much -- too many entrees are over-reliant on cream or cheese sauces. (Who needs a cream sauce on steak, really?) But they happily left the sauce off my small (7 oz.) sirloin, served it medium as ordered (not medium-rare), and it made for a light, 550-calorie late meal. I'm guessing that the portions are now a little smaller to pay for the redecoration, because the menu prices looked the same. Really important: call ahead to make sure there's no ""special event"" taking place. A couple of Thursday nights have included a deejay, a black-light bar night, or some similar event that added noise to the relatively small space. It is what it is. Applebee's won't ever be a grown-up restaurant, but they've taken large strides toward becoming less and less like an overstuffed garage with a cheap old boombox stereo. Nice move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
5,Xenia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,243,469.0,3.0,2013-10-13,"The food here is terrible. The only thing that made my experience here was my awesome server, who gave us a complimentary side of potatoes after we weren't satisfied with our order. The drinks are nicely priced, but the food was lacking. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with fries. When she received her food it looked like somebody just tossed some scraps of old fries at the bottom of the pan and gave it to her. The burger was dried out and lacked flavor. A whopper would've been better than this poor excuse of a burger! At least that's juicy! The only reason I'm giving Applebee's 3 stars is because our waiter tried his best to make us happy. Eat at your own risk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
7,Shawn B.,"Gasport, NY",1,11,2.0,3.0,2014-08-20,"It Applebee's, nuff said.. I just came to have a few drinks since it was next to hotel.. This location had nice servers, it's a small college town, and this place was closest to campus so it was packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
6,Cassandra L.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,71,8.0,1.0,2014-09-06,"2 months layered and tried it again with a group of friends. We were ordering drinks and food trying to have a great time. Our waitress wouldn't stop making snide comments about us ordering more drinks and desserts. She threw a fit three times because we ordered more drinks. She then gave us a receipt to sort out ourselves of who got what and corrected it as necessary. We spent $130 and only wanted a good time, but she did a great job being a Debby Downer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
8,Emily E.,"Whitesville, NY",1,7,1.0,1.0,2014-10-21,"I did not enjoy my dinner at all, and neither did my cousin.  I may be 19, but I prefer to eat off the kid's menu because I can finish the whole meal,  I don't really like anything on the adult menu, and food doesn't get wasted. When I requested the kid's menu I was laughed at, told no, and given an adult menu. I then ordered the Honey Pepper Chicken Mac & Cheese in which case the Mac & Cheese was absolutely drowning in Honey Pepper sauce...it was disgusting. My cousin ordered the Bourbin Street Steak, and she says it wad soggy, the onions and mushrooms weren't grilled with the steak, and the steak itself looked like a square hamburger patty. The only good part about the whole experience was the games on the table POS. I'm going to avoid going to that Applebee's for as long as I can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,

3,Mark P.,"Hughesville, PA",1,10,2.0,4.0,2015-06-28,"Late diner in the middle of nowhere led us to this Applebee's .  Despite reviews I had a pretty tasty brew pub philly, my wife had a good (but not great) burger and my daughter had the salmon and liked it( despite the small portion). Overall it's a 4 stars for where it is located.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
4,Justin D.,"Olean, NY",14,1,,1.0,2015-09-25,"As usual, horrible food, terrible wait times for frozen entrees. Cramped seating is still no surprise, and their restaurant manager is stuck on her high horse. Good job on providing a terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
2,Corey H.,"Hinsdale, NY",6,12,4.0,1.0,2015-12-09,"The last 2 visits were exactly the same. Terrible customer service. My last two trips ended the same way, we walked out. Our last visit, my girlfriend and I waited for the server for at least 15 minutes before he to our drink orders. Tea and water!!! Took 10 minutes! He literally just jogged over with an attitude and slammed them on our table then stormed off. Another 20 minutes went by and still no service. I left 5$ on the table an we left.   The previous visit was just as bad. The place wasn't crowded at all. I'd understand if they were extremely busy but it wasn't. We were seated immediately with plenty of seats available. All I saw was servers standing around playing on their cell  phones. Hire better help! We might try one more time but for now, its Perkins for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
1,John B.,"Tonawanda, NY",55,97,13.0,1.0,2017-01-15,"Oh Applebees. Well one thing is for certian. You will never see me in this location ever again. Where to start.  Late saturday night meal. We ordered an appetizer first. Brew pub pretzels. They were completely undercooked. The cheezy beer sauce was like water and tasted like just a beer. I like beer. But not to dip my brew pub pretzel in. We ordered dinner. I had a two 4 oz steak dinner with bacon jam sauce, loaded potatoe cuts and sweet potatoes fries, and a dinner salad. Wife ordered the pick 3 app trio. Chicken casadilla, french onion soup, and a cesar salad. After a 20-25 minute wait inside a empty resturant her food came out. The bowl of soup was laterally half full. We joked about it. The salad had four salads worth of dressing on it. The casaidilla was not worth eating or even putting in a to go box.  Now my dinner was a joke. The steak was brought out completely undercooked. No one asked how it was and i was hungry so i ate them. They werent even close to the same size. It was like there was 1/2 of a 4oz steak missing. Never got my salad. Never was asked to refill our drinks until we were done eating. So i asked if they had honey or butter for my fried. She said no but thry have a maple dipping sauce. Yea it was frosting like for a honey bun or cinnamon rolls. What a joke. Everything was below par. Service sucked food sucked tv size sucked refill sucked Applebees you no longer have the pleasure of having us as your customers. Were done",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olean-3,,,,,
