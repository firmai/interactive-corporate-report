46,Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282.0,3.0,2012-01-07,"I've always kind of liked this chain, and this coming from a guy who has a bit of a disdain for chain restaurants at times.  I don't know that I would call their food the best, but they do have some things about them I appreciate.   For instance, the bottomless fries are a good touch.  Even though I don't often take advantage of the deal, it's good to know that if I demand more fries with my burger, I get more fries with no questions asked.   Actually, they tend to ask you if you want more before you get around to it.  I am a fan of their steakhouse style of fries as well.  If you like big thick fries, you'll be OK with these.   Getting a free burger and sundae on your birthday through their e-mail club makes the  cheapskate in me happy, and was the reason for my visit here.  Nothing like getting a full on gourmet burger with guacamole, cheese, onion, and bacon, bottomless fries, ice cream, and unlimited refills on iced tea, and having the bill come back at $2.63.  Even if it is for one day, it's a nice thing.  Otherwise that combo is over 14 bucks, which is par for the course for what you get.   Quality of the burger is on the decent end of the spectrum.  Maybe not the absolute best around.  But they have enough creative combinations to keep me interested.  They have a more expansive menu than the burgers, though I haven't tried much else in my Red Robin history of several visits to the chain.   Atmosphere is very chainy.  Kids will like it though.  I liked staring at pictures of blown up old tobacco baseball cards on the wall at the bar while eating my burger.  Sure it's contrived.  But it's OK.  Service was prompt, but I came on a slow day.  Everyone here was very friendly though.  Very good touch.   All in all, I say it's not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

Go to Panera Bread for a better salad with a better price.The garlic bread was fine and the service was fine.  My first visit several years ago was a disappointment.

So when the waiter came over, I asked him how they worked, and what I could use them for throughout the course of our meal. He told me I could order drinks, and appetizers and deserts, and pay the bill. So he actually took the first drink order. When he came back with the drinks from the bar, I asked him if we could place an appetizer, to which he responded, ""yeah, right on the computer at the table."" Which meant to me, I don't want to do my job so use this. After placing the appetizer order through the computer, he proceeded to gather with other staff behind the bar and talk. Never coming over to ask how we were doing. After ordering the main courses through him, because apparently you cannot order the main dish on the tableside computer, we never saw him again. He and his ""buddy"" got behind the bar and started singing together, as if I am not trying to enjoy my meal.

35,B E.,"Downingtown, PA",0,7,,1.0,2015-06-24,"Decent food; excruciatingly slow service time and time again. I don't know why I've given this Red Robin as many chances as I have. Every time I have gone I think to myself, ""Well, the service can't be as bad as last time"", and every time I am wrong. For example, last night we went there for dinner. They were moderately busy, but not packed. Our kids' meals came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the food for me and my wife took 45-60 minutes! Just for a burger and a wrap. We asked for tartar sauce for my son's fish. When she eventually brought it, she said, ""oh, I have the tartar sauce here, but I see that he's done."" (Maybe that should be a clue that you took WAY too long to bring it). We also asked for marinara for my daughter's meatballs. Despite stopping by twice to say, ""that marinara will be right up"", the waitress never brought it. My wife asked for a refill of her lemonade. Then the kids ordered dessert, got it, ate their sundaes, my wife and I finished or meals, and we paid at the kiosk. About 30 minutes had passed, and still no lemonade.  As we were getting up to leave, the waitress appeared with the lemonade and said, ""Oh, do you want me to put this in a to go cup?"" I've been to this Red Robin 5 or 6 times in the past few months, and only once was the service ""not ridiculously bad"". It's a shame, I like the food, but I don't think I can stand to give them another chance.

We used a gift card but needed to add an extra payment of $11 to leave an appropriate tip.. The kiosk wouldn't let us use additional payment. The manager said the only way we could pay the additional money for tip was to buy something off the menu and open a new check. My husband had to ""buy"" beans to pay the rest of her tip and never actually got the beans so we paid an extra $1 just to leave the tip which didn't go towards the tip... So frustrating.

Placed our order, and since it was late and the babies were tired asked for some fries to hold everyone over. This was promised but never arrived.

It was now more than an hour after we arrived and there was still no sign of food, so we asked if we could get it all to go.

30,Douglas K.,"West Chester, PA",2,4,,1.0,2016-06-04,"I have a lot of fond memories from Red Robin in the Pacific Northwest that date back to the last century. So, when my daughter wanted to visit our local Red Robin instead of her Parents' first choice of Uno's it was an easy sell.  Too bad we did not go to Uno's.... Our server took our order and promptly took off.  Dirty dishes and silverware were promptly switched out. The appetizers came and the server promptly took off.  Unfortunately, our entrees promptly came as we were eating the appetizers. All too prompt....  This wasn't a lunch rush.   I ordered my all time favorite- the Royal Burger.  I stopped trying other burgers, because I was always disappointed knowing what I missed out on.  My Royal burger was cold.  It was not piping hot fresh, but absolutely room temperature.  After some debate, I sent it back.  A new one was promptly made and delivered.  It was warm, except the whites of the egg. They did not see much heat in the kitchen because there were some that were still raw.  Besides the problems with my burger, the waiter was completely ambivalent.  He did what he had to do at a minimum for his tip and took off trying to avoid requests from us.   When we left there were three members of the staff at the hostess stand hanging out and talking. Not a one said a word. No ""Thank You"" or ""Good Night"".  Sort of summed up the experience for the evening - take the money while providing the absolute minimum level of service.   Simply put it out if your mind that one of the three opened the door for us when we exited.   I felt sad and let down. My favorite Royal Burger isn't Royal anymore and neither is Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
55,Kim A.,"Sparks, NV",1,25,3.0,3.0,2016-07-14,"The burgers here are great. My favorite is the whiskey river bbq burger. The best part of the restaurant is the bottomless fries and beverages. However, the staff almost never asks if you want a refill on either of them. I was very upset when I was here yesterday. My boyfriend and I both ordered the cupcake milkshake (which is delicious) BUT mine was barely half full. I walked over to the guy at the bar who makes them and tried to get his attention multiple times. We made eye contact twice and he blatantly ignored me. One of his coworkers acknowledged me and apologized for him because i mentioned how rude he was. I told her my issue about the half full milkshake and she told me it's because the ""classic"" milkshakes are supposed to come half full. ....but my boyfriends milkshake was completely filled to the brim? Not to mention....why pay 5 dollars for a half a cup of a milkshake? It made no sense. She then told me she would make me a new one and to keep the half full one. I walked back to my booth and two minutes later she comes back saying she actually needs to take the old one. Whatever lady. They made us a new one but we pretty much waited 30 minutes for this stupid milkshake. I was annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
34,Ally H.,"Exton, PA",10,2,,1.0,2016-08-24,"Well. First off, it took us 5 minutes to be seated because there was no host, even though there was clearly no one in the restaurant. Second off, my ""Sprite"" I ordered, was no more than carbonated water. Last and foremost, our waiter somehow expected us to eat with our fingers and lick them clean after, after he forgot napkins and utensils. In conclusion, it sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003

31,Lori R.,"West Chester, PA",21,1,,2.0,2016-10-28,"All of my families prior visits would have been at least four stars. This one was not. The new wait  app failed due to hostess error and then we were seated at one of the tables by the TOGO door. It was a very cold night and although I am glad RR has good business, it was very cold each time they went in and out. We mentioned it to the manager who said that she understood and that they do not use it in the winter for that reason. She said she would have the server use a different door (as they do in the winter). Well either she forgot or he was insubordinate. He never stopped using the side door near our table. The family next to us were also in disbelief as they heard her statement and were also cold. You cannot enjoy any meal when you are cold and the manager does not follow up on her promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
21,Joe C.,"Phoenixville, PA",86,189,1.0,2.0,2017-01-07,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages but since I got a $5.00 coupon in the mail, I figured what better time. Although they have some fairly ambitious burger offerings I went with one of my tried-and-trues, the mushroom and swiss. No complaints whatsoever about the burger; it tasted great, the mushrooms were fresh not canned, and the meat was cooked to my medium rare specifications.  My issue is that unless you have a coupon I don't think their offerings provide good value for the prices; honestly, I feel like even with my coupon, the value is questionable given these are only single burgers.  The all-you-can-eat fries is idiotic, in my opinion, and seems like a way to compensate.  Who the hell is going to want third or even second portions of fries?  I actually opted for broccoli instead of fries.  Maybe I should've had the fries because the broccoli was rubbery and wilted. The service was typical for a chain: efficient and pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
24,Gracie J.,"Irvine, CA",217,682,336.0,2.0,2017-02-05,"Two stars and not one because the service was good. My colleague had a birthday ""free burger"" coupon which she wanted to use instead on a milkshake and the staff here made it happen. But aside from that, the rest of the food is abysmal. The french onion soup I had was so incredibly salty that I thought my blood pressure would skyrocket just from the amount of sodium - it was undrinkable. The table kiosks they have for checkout failed to print out a paper receipt for me and I needed one for my business trip reimbursement. This is really a last-ditch option for those who are staying at hotels nearby with no access to a car (or unwilling to Lyft/cab it).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002

Very friendly and informative about the menu, making it easy to place and order.  Burgers are great and easily one of the top places in the area to get a burger for take out.

27,Michele S.,"Endicott, NY",29,1,,1.0,2017-07-23,"Attended a team dinner. Yes, there were over 40 of us and the coach made reservations. The room off to the bar was ready for our group but for some reason the hostess was now ready to seat us. The lobby was filling up and a severe thunderstorm was on the way. Thank goodness our coach was proactive telling the hostess it would be a good idea to seat our group soon as the guests could not all fit in the lobby. Then the rain came, a downpour and the ceiling began to leak everywhere. Water was pouring out from the bar and dripping on our tables. The staff did nothing but bring out two buckets to catch the rain. We had to strategically move the tables around not to be dripped on. The staff was unphased.  The meal took over an hour to begin being served. The waitresses and waiters did not have a clue. Our coaches served the food. I had to ask for a cloth to clean a table and had to ask for utensils and napkins at the bar. The staff were happy to give the items to me but just not bring it. Both my daughters had incorrect meals. My other daughter's burger was too pink and falling apart. No drink refills were offered. My husbands burger was cold. The meal cost over 70 and was a huge disappointment. We have enjoyed Red Robin at other locations in the past but will be avoiding it from now on. The RR was just dirty, gross and should be closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
