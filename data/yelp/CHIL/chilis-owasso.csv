Steve H.,"Owasso, OK",63,100,26,4.0,7/16/2017,I hadn't been to a Chilis in a while so I was interested to see the menu had evolved somewhat with new choices. There is a pretty broad selection of food from Tex-Mex to steaks and more traditional American foods. We ordered burgers. M got the traditional and I ordered the sunrise burger. The sunrise was great. Full of flavor and huge. I especially liked the pickles they put on it. They are different than the run of the mill pickles.  A piece of the hamburger broke off and I picked it up and ate it separately. It was really good meat.  I'm not a big fan of the fries. Nothing special about them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
Travis Q.,"Tulsa, OK",28,83,7,2.0,3/16/2016,"Not bad but not great.  Can't order ala cart from the kids menu which is a real pain. We talked with the manager, and while I feel he had it in his power to allow this, he did not make any concessions for us. So for a 1 year old who doesn't like eating baby food, we had to order a full kids meal...which obviously is way too much food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
Drew B.,"Owasso, OK",107,329,28,2.0,9/2/2014,"It's not horrible, but it's not awesome either. When I moved to Owasso 10 years ago this was probably the best option in town. With the new competition around it is easy to pass this place up. We went for a late dinner on Saturday. Plenty of room in the dining area. The bar was more packed and seemed to be lively. The place was clean, the servers were nice. The food was just OK. Prices are ok, service is fine. Nothing interesting. I'd go back, but only if it was someone else's decision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
John H.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,5,4,4.0,2/8/2015,"The food's not bad, the service isn't bad either. The water tasted kinda ick, but that's to be expected in the city I guess. Good shrimp and meat. Good shrimp but they only have two flavor options... Overall a good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
Steve S.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,36,4,4.0,3/16/2015,Pretty good soup and Chili. The hot sauce and chips are great. Get the bottomless soup. That's the best. Service is great and the people are nice. Give them a shot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
Ryan F.,"Pittsburg, KS",3,20,8,4.0,4/7/2015,"Great service. Server named Cecelia, hope that's how it's spelled. She was very kind, sweet, attentive, good memory no need for pad for order. Other than that food was great kind of wish I knew mac and cheese came with jalapeños in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
Christopher S.,"Austin, TX",84,102,32,2.0,6/28/2010,"This place is pretty much the best of a bad area. If you don't want Applebees, have already had Subway and you hate your body, I guess this place is your best bet.  The BBQ Sauce was a little too sweet and altogether mediocre. A companion who had the ribs was unimpressed. Another who had the chicken fajitas said that the were good although a little oily. I had a black bean veggie patty with the Shiner Bock BBQ sauce and the shoestring onion rings on it. The black bean burger was fairly bland ( even for a veggie burger ), there was not enough sauce on the bun, and the sauce wasn't very good to begin with. I would recommend it to anyone I liked. The fries were so salty I think my cholesterol now has high cholesterol. Seriously I wouldn't be surprised if they just brushed some of the salt off the fries to salt the steaks.  Regarding the service, we were seated immediately and our drinks were refilled before we had to ask, which I imagine was challenging since we each finished 4 or 5 glasses ( give us a break it was like 105 with humidity).  Needless to say I wasn't blown away by this meal, but maybe I'm not a gluten for food punishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso
