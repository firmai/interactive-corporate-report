Cindy V.,"Lodi, CA",3,45,8,2.0,2/19/2017,"Came here on a Thursday night for a family night out... we preferred to sit away from crowds because we have a toddler who loves to talk, laugh, and some times screams when he doesn't get what he wants. Luckily, they had some tables in a corner away from everyone else. (+1 star for accommodating us). The food (+1 star).... -Our waiter brought us a few dirty plates for our appetizers. When I said dirty, I mean it has grease from food left on it and food stuck to it. Yuck! My kids refused to use the plates - couldn't blame them as I wouldn't either. -Our steak came out dried, so dried that my 11 year old didn't want to finish his steak. We had requested for his steak to be medium well done, it came out well done. -The second steak plate - the broccoli was overlooked. Couldn't tell if it was burnt in the oven or how it was cooked. But it looked dried out and didn't look fresh. Refills on our drinks? No it didn't happen. -My toddler ate off my plate of pasta. Guess it was good, he ate it without complaining. -My other kids enjoyed their meals, no complaints besides their drinks weren't being refilled even though our waiter and a waitress had checked on us several times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2

Sabrina H.,"South Hadley, MA",0,7,8,3.0,8/10/2017,"I've been to Chili's numerous times and the waiting period for 2-4 people for dinner has been 10 mins or less, which is quite reasonable. For dinner, I enjoy the 2 for $20, which is now 2 for $22. It's an excellent choice for dining casually and on a budget. You get two full-sized entrees and 1 appetizer for only $22! If you're out with a lover or just with friends, it's a good way to save money and also have options. The wait for the food is anywhere from 10-20 mins depending on how busy they are. The food isn't particularly wonderful, but the pricing and quality match well. The staff could have checked on us more often because we needed more water, but it wasn't a major issue.

Got seated and noticed dirty dishes on the center divider between booths. Also noticed the floor was dirty under the tables with food and garbage. We should have left again but we did not. We ordered our food and our broccoli was raw. We sent it back and it came back after our food was finished. On the plus side our waitress was good and very apologetic.

We were tired from moving, and unpacking so we decided to get To Go so we could relax at home.  Food was TERRIBLE! Everything appeared to be reheated in a microwave as if it had been made HOURS before. My husband ordered the fajitas - steak was uncooked and EXTREMELY stringy. Shrimp was shrunken and gross. I ordered the Cajun Chicken pasta - any pasta lover knows the difference between fresh and microwaved pasta. The sauce was clumped together and the chicken was chewy - YUCK! We ordered 2 of the chips, salsa & queso - only received 1... This place is a joke!  So - why take it to Yelp?! Well, we always call management to address our concerns, as we did on this occasion. We were told that we would be getting coupons - yes, coupons - to relieve the issue. She promised they were worth while. Well - here we are, 3 weeks later with NO such coupon, gift card, nothing!

My friend and I ordered CoronaRitas (which were amazing!!) but they took even longer than the appetizers to come out.  Our entrees took another 45 mins and also were somewhat cold. Many little things wrong with all of our food but the worst was there being a hair in our food.

Saw some of the reviews before coming, so we were expecting poor service, but adequate to good level of food and drinks that is standard for the Chili's brand and their affordable price point.  However, our waitress was very attentive and quick, and there were no issues with our orders or food and drinks.  You don't expect filet mignon at McDonalds. Set your expectations according to the restaurant level.  A normal Chili's would probably get a 3star from me, this one exceeded my expectations and gets  4. Would go again.

Kristen M.,"Empire, CA",81,13,,1.0,1/22/2017,Our party of 6 went to Chili's last night. The call ahead seating worked fabulously. We were seated within 2 min while the walk in wait was 20-30min. Then things were less impressive. 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by our waitress. Drinks were brought quickly after that. Two tables seated nearby but after us had their dinners before we had our appetizers. Our dinners were served about 3 minutes after the appetizers. We were asked if we wanted dessert and we said yes but she never came back with a menu. After waiting and waiting my husband finally went to the hostess and asked for our bill because our ziosk wasn't working. But we had to wait awhile longer for the waitress.

Lexie G.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/15/2016,"I usually only come for happy hour but my sister and grandma wanted to have lunch here. There are a few reasons for just the 2 stars.  1. It took a little while for our server to greet our table when it was not busy at all. I think she only had 3 other tables, all of which were close to being done. When taking our drink orders she kept rushing us to order food as well, which is really annoying.  2. We asked if we could order from the Happy Hour menu and our server told us yes. A few minutes go by and the bartender comes to our table to tell us that we can't order Happy Hour from our table, and if we want we can go to the bar, order our drinks, and then take them back to our table. Which is ridiculous and honestly not true. I've ordered happy hour before while not being seated in the bar area.  3. It took forever to get our servers attention after she dropped off our drinks. My grandmother's water had ranch or bleu cheese in the cup and on the lemon of her water. When we told our server she said ""oh I think it's just on the outside of the glass on the bottom."" I had to also point out the ranch or bleu cheese on the lemon to her.  Overall, not the best experience. The food was decent.

Dale N.,"Stockton, CA",2197,720,6554,2.0,4/26/2012,"2 Stars....yes, I have had better...ribs! Friends wanted to go to Chili's for dinner. They said they have decent ribs. Was worried that they come in precooked and they just reheat. According to the menu, they are done in-house. I ordered a rack of their signature ribs.. Sides of loaded mashed potatoes and the beans. Ribs were average...nothing outstanding...nothing that I would drive across town for.  They were probably cooked a few hours prior...and in the process of trying to keep them warm, they were pretty dried out.  Fresh might be better? The loaded potatoes were good...made with the skins still  on the potatoes.  Not over mashed.  Topped with cheese, bacon and onions.  I enjoyed them. The beans...meh.  Nondescript.  Pretty much tasteless.  Black beans I believe.  Would not order these again. Service was ok.  Mango iced tea was weak. It is tough to find ribs better than Waterloo or Texas Roadhouse.   They pretty much set the standard for ribs around here.   I have to say Chili's ribs were much better than the ones that I had at Royces the other night. To me, Chili's is an upscale Denny's or Carrows.  I have never been a fan of the restaurant.  I might try the 'all you can eat soup and salad' during lunch for $7.09 sometime...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=20

Bia R.,"Sacramento, CA",67,31,30,2.0,11/8/2014,"I remember I used to love this place in my 20's. I thought they had the best buffalo wings... you know before my palette grew up and I realized that pre-made/frozen, microwaved to order, food has no soul (i.e. flavor)  For a chain, it's not bad and definitely gets points for being a fun, casual, and affordable spot. But seriously, there are much better non-chain options around town. I went with a co-worker who wanted to split the 2 for $20 deal.  Two people share an appetizer and get an entree each from a pre-selected list.  We sat at the bar to avoid the crazy busy and noisy child infested dining room and overloaded waiting area. The bartender was super awesome and very friendly.  The little touch screen bar menus were also very handy and enticing. They do have great prices on their margaritas for happy hour.  Honestly,  you can make a better tasting margarita at home, unless you prefer the pre-made mix.  They are a little on the sweet side for my taste.  Nonetheless, they don't skimp on the tequila, or at least our bartender didn't.  She did a great job keeping us and the bar patrons very happy.  We split mozzarella sticks for the app.  After a few bites, I stopped because I was bored with the lack of flavor and sad for their desperate journey.  They definitely came from some frozen mozzarella stick farm. I swear those bites I took, are still lingering in the pit of my belly and moaning.  For the entree, I ordered the margarita lime chicken. It wasn't bad but it was disappointingly dry and bland and not very hot.  The plate was sizzling hot as we were warned by the bartender but the food, was 'eh'.  It did not live up to the vivid detailed descriptions or flavor promises.

Jonathan James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,24,15,2.0,4/5/2011,"I'm indifferent writing reviews about restaurant chains. They have no authenticity or originality and can be found in almost every major metropolitan area. It's the safe choice when visiting a city because you know of it. Chili's is no different, but I won't compare dishes with different of the same chain. Stockton's Chili's is my destination for dinner with some friends. It's the season of lent and I've given up dining all meats except the ocean dwellers. Yes I'm a pescatarian for the next 40 days and 40 nights. My choices are very limited here under the seafood and it all seems unappealing. But I do make a choice that sounds safe. A friend and I will be splitting on the 2 for 20, it's an appetizer and 2 dinners. Tonight I'm just hungry and I'm not daring enough to try any fish that's been likely sitting in the freezer for a week. We order the Texas Cheese Fries as the appetizer so I stop there. If it has Texas in the name it definitely has meat in it.  My intuitions were right and the waitress informs us bacon bits top the Fries. Sorry bacon, you're pieces of pure pork goodness is going to have to be on the side. My dinner will be the Fried Shrimp, a safe move if you ask me. Anything battered and fried you can't go wrong. Or could it? Well the Fried Shrimp comes with a basket of French Fries, Coleslaw, and what looks like watered down spinach ranch dip. Looks interesting enough I dip my shrimp in it. Whoa! This has some kick to it, a little spicy like horseradish. I ask the waitress what this sauce is. It's ""Ancho-Ranch."" Never heard of ancho-ranch. Really didn't expect it to have some kick like that. Waitress kindly asks if I want regular ranch, but I decline and eat my food with this sauce. You know what? I think I kind of like it.

Tina M.,"Stockton, CA",0,39,11,1.0,7/8/2014,"I came into Chilis at 9:20pm which was very close to closing time. I could tell by the look on the bartenders face that she was a little irritated that we came and sat at the bar. I sat down and asked her (Sara) if there were any happy hour specials. So she showed them to me on their new little digital table thing. So then i ordered 2 orders of the boneless buffalo wings & a drink. When the order came out i was amazed at how much a short order for the happy hour menu actually came with. It was quite a lot of boneless buffalo pieces. So when the bartender gave me my check I noticed that she charged me 7.99 for the 2 orders which were supposed to be 2.99 Happy Hour special.  So I asked her. I said ""arent the boneless buffalo wings 2.99 for the happy hour special?"" She took the tab from my hand and said ""oh, you wanted the happy hour ones?"" With attitude and walked away. Then she came back and said ""well I can change the price but you need to specify which ones you want next time."" So I felt like she was trying to make it seem like it was my fault and her attitude did not help as well. So I told her that ""I dont have a problem paying full price for my food but what i do have a problem with is the attitude you are giving me. And its your job as a server to make sure you get the right order from me. Why would you think I wanted the reg menu wings when i asked you for the happy hour specials?"" So she then again grabbed the tab, left for a little bit and came back to change it. Then a tall asian man walked over who never introduced himself no did he have a uniform on. He had a faded red t shirt on. He asked me if there was a problem. I told him not really. I just didnt appreciate her attitude and the way she was telling me that I need to be the one to specify between happy hour menu and reg menu. And he said ""well it is your job to do that."" Clearly, they must be 'friends' and she went back there and said whatever she said. So I told him how is it my job when she is the server/bartender and I clearly came in here asking about the happy hour specials. Im sitting right at the bar too. So how is it I should be the one to confirm what im ordering. It seems to me she should ask the customers that question. Well he still proceeded to say no and I was the one in the wrong. They changed the amount but that still doesnt change the horrible attitude the bartender had and the un professional ""manager"" if even thats who he was. They totally made me feel like I was in the wrong which was only making the situation worse. I thought in the restaurant business the customer is always right??? I guess not here at Chillis.

Joe E.,"Stockton, CA",1,31,1,4.0,2/19/2007,"I'll lead off this review with a disclaimer: it has a very narrow focus. What I mean by that is that I only end up ordering one or all of four things off the menu at Chili's, no matter where: 1. Skillet Queso - Always fantastic. Always. 2. Applewood Bacon Cheeseburger - They haven't botched it. Yet. 3. Chicken Caeser Pita - Apparently being phased out. Boo. 4. Chocolate Shake - Again, never botched to date. Those four items have never been screwed up or tasted bad, so if that'll cover you you're set. Based on what i hear from others, I don't think I'll stray too far from those things and risk disappointment / food poisoning. Based on my fiancee's feedback, however, the Margarita Chicken Platter and the sizzling Fajitas are good too. As for service, honestly, it's Chili's. I'm not expecting stellar service from them and my tip reflects my level of satisfaction. I rarely drink any alcoholic beverages there, but they've been OK the few times I have. My constant advice for places like this is that if you have any doubts about what you'll get from a ""standard"" item, specify what you want in it. If you want lemon, make sure you ask for it. Expecting every place to get it right is a recipe for letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=140

Aaron P.,"Stockton, CA",1,16,,3.0,12/18/2008,"I've been to this Chili's numerous times and depending on the day, the food/service can be anywhere from 1 star to 5.  Most of the waitresses/waiters are cool and will check on  you periodically to make sure your drinks are full or to see if you need anything.  One thing I hate about this Chili's though - they are stingy as hell with french fries.  Other than that, it's a cool spot, and millions of times better than that garbage ass Chili's in Lodi. Whenever I go on dates, I rank them on a similar system used on here (1-5 stars).  This is a great place to take a 1-2 star date. When looking over the menu just make sure that you persuade her to order from either the Big Mouth Burger or Classic Chicken section.  (Those are the cheapest sections on the menu) Anything over $9.99 simply isn't worth it at Chili's, as I'm usually laughing at my friends that pay over $13 dollars for a a half rack of tiny baby back ribs and complain that they are still hungry after finishing their food, while I'm full off of a $7 burger, with half of it placed in a carryout box.

We have been to Chilis maybe five times in the last three months and I only had one good dining experience out of the five. The rest were not good. The food is usually good (if it isn't cold) but it is the service that is so bad! The last time we (my friend, my husband and I) went the server seemed nice but the drinks came out slow and the appetizer came out freezing and even slower! When my friend was pretty upset so he complained to the waiter and asked for the manager. My friend explained that the food was freezing and that so far we have not had a great experience. The manager said he apologized and would bring a new appetizer out. Then my friend said okay we will order another round of beers while we wait... the manager then preceded to tell us that it was a rule that we could only have one drink per person on the table and then asked my friend what round of drinks he was on because they had another rule that they could only serve three drinks per hour! We had been there for 30 minutes by this time and had one large beer (which wasn't done yet). I have NEVER seen a manager be so rude... I am not usually one to speak up about bad service or food but I did at Chili's because I felt like the manager was attacking my friend. We ended up arguing with the manager until finally one of us said ""Ok we would just like to leave right now, please cancel our order."" The manager said ""Ok , have a good night"". We walked out without even finishing our drinks because we were all so upset.

The waitres was rude  and show no respect to the customer. In my experience the waiter we got this time did a better job than the other girl  that was suposse  to serve us. I would not recomend this place to anyone and will not come back and eat at this location. I really Blame  the service  issue to management.  Sorprisely nobody at this locations read the reviews..For a restaurant like this and this many negative  service reviews I would already fire the management of this location.. Good luck  to those  that chosse to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Ronnesha L.,"Stockton, CA",7,122,201,3.0,1/17/2016,My favorite place has disappointed my taste buds. Our Friday night wine movies and food was a thumbs down. The new smothered chicken burrito was nothing they described it to be. I went out of my comfort zone from Salmon to this super dry rice burrito. Tons of rice that didn't seem fresh or maybe mixed with old rice. What got my attention was 3 cheese and smothered. Not by a long shot. The moist driest meal I had in a long time. I seen no cheese and barely drizzle on top. The boneless wings were super dry drenched in sauce. Thank you honey mustard for camouflaging everything. I will stick to my Super yummy Salmon from now on. Hopefully the cooks hasn't change and my salmon starts to be dry. Ugh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Nicole T.,"Stockton, CA",458,36,3,1.0,1/27/2016,"I'm sad to say it's awful. The service is soso but the food isn't even good. I've tried 4 different occasions.

Art J.,"Stockton, CA",1,5,5,1.0,4/16/2016,The reservation check in system is a joke you can be the only one waiting and a call in jumps ahead of you after they tell you it's going to take 5-10 mins. You are sat at a wet table let's see how the service is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Llesica O.,"Stockton, CA",0,22,1,1.0,2/14/2016,They served me a piece of chicken that was half raw. The manager wasn't understanding. She didn't even offer me a discount. I won't ever go there again. Especially with their bad customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Monica N.,"Stockton, CA",49,61,109,3.0,7/7/2013,Today I came here because I had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. I decided to have the chips & Queso as my appetizer. For my meal I did the 2 for $20 with the bf which came with an appetizer and two entrees. We got a half chipotle chicken flat bread to share. As for entrees I got a half rack of BBQ ribs with fries and he got bacon ranch quesadilla & added southwestern Mac and cheese to his meal.  The flatbread (appetizer) came out at the same time as our entree so the waiter willingly took it off our bill. She was really kind to us.  Everything tasted average. Still searching for an amazing American place to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Jon S.,"Salem, OR",7,32,33,4.0,4/18/2016,"This is based on corporate chain restaurants. I dunno why but I enjoy chilis. Had a sampler platter to go and I was stuffed. U pick 3 and the options are good. I was told the cheddar bites aren't the greatest though. Creamy jalapeño boneless chicken wings, southwestern egg rolls chicken strips and sliders. So unhealthy but good for the munchies",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40

A N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,25,55,4.0,3/12/2015,Went for lunch today with my best girl and had a great meal.  We had the light fare steak and salmon.  We were in a rush and they were very accommodating.  Lunch come out within 14 minutes and steak and fish were not dry.  Sides were good.  We will return to try other specials,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
Adam W.,"Stockton, CA",1,16,,3.0,8/20/2015,"If being sat in the general dining areas, the service can be fairly hit and miss. One waiter in particular, (little tiny short guy) is terrible. I've seen him multiple times putting his fingers ON the plates while carrying them to our table. DISGUSTING!!! My recommendation, if he is your server, ask for a table in a different section. On the other hand, we have began just seating ourselves in the bar area and the bartender Anthony is AWESOME!!! He is personable, his customer service is outstanding, and he remembers what we order. Anthony gets 5 stars!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40

Bret G.,"Stockton, CA",159,6,6,1.0,9/7/2015,"Probably won't go here again. Came in for a drink and waited for about 10 for service. None whatsoever, especially when the server looked right at us and completely disregarded our existence. If you have to wait more than 5 minutes to order a drink, than its probably best to just get out and go across the street to BJ's especially when the bar area wasn't even busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40

Danielle J.,"Stockton, CA",24,111,28,4.0,5/25/2014,"I don't know why but I am just now getting to this restaurant.  Of course I pass it all the time. Our experience was pleasant, and our waitress & bartender were eager to please. However, my strawberry daiquiri was on the weak side--so if I ever return I will order my usual ice tea.  The fried onion with jalapeño was great and so was my steak with loaded mashed potatoes & broccoli.  My boyfriend ordered the half-slab of ribs, he said it was good but I felt they needed to add a salad or some kind of vegetable.  Presentation goes a long way with me and it just looked plain they didn't put any effort into this simple dish.  Not even any kind of garnish, just ribs on a plate.   We came in after 7 p.m., so we ordered dinner not lunch. The place was crowded as it was Friday night and a holiday weekend, so we ended up sitting in the bar area.  There was a rather rowdy crowd of tipsy women who were overly loud.  But, that didn't bother us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=40
