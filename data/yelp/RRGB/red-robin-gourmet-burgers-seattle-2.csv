Brad A.,"Seattle, WA",35,238,,3.0,2/13/2010,"Not bad & cute waiters!  :)  It's close to the UW where I go to school.  Of course, I always get the regular hamburger there.  They usually are pretty busy in the summer because they have a nice view of the canal and have outdoor seating.   The parking lot is sort of weird because it's on a very steep hill, so I park across the street under the freeway.   Nice full bar...cute bartender :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-seattle-2
