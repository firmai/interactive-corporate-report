Karla-Lenina C.,"Newport Beach, CA",95,43,25,3.0,4/30/2012,"It was more of a 2.5, but I'll be nice today.  This location switched to the new menu once the new year started; my family and I have been avoiding this location for that very reason (Hello?!!!  This girl needs her Pan-Sauteed Salmon with Spaghettini in Lemon Caper Sauce.).  Yet today, for reasons unknown, my mom and I found ourselves in the very location that took away our one true fishy-and-lemon-zesty love. The food was okay.  Half-sized portions of the salads were very generous, and the pasta was decent.  However, my little gripe about today's visit was our waiter--Luis.  He was not very attentive.  He didn't offer us any refills until the end... when he handed us our bill.  -___- Didn't ask us if we wanted dessert.  I asked for Parmesan cheese right when he brought out our food, but somehow I didn't get it until 10 minutes late... He was nice when we he first greeted and seated us, but that quickly dissipated.  He just seemed to be off in his own lala-land.  It wasn't awful service, but it was enough to annoy me to want to Yelp about it. More than likely, I'll be hitting up my regular CPK in Brea before going back to the West Co. location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=20
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,4.0,2/8/2011,"I came here with my bf and his little sister for her birthday. She has never gone to CPK and she really wanted to try it so I persuaded my bf to let us go. Once we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. It was a rainy day so there wasn't many people there.  What we got: Chipotle Chicken Pizza($12): I was deciding between the thai chicken pizza and the chiptole chicken pizza, but I've already tried the thai chicken so I decided to go with the chipotle chicken this time. I was glad I got it! It was delicious, but I wish it didn't have beans in the salsa...But anyways...I gave a slice to my bf and to his little sister and they both thought it was pretty good as well.  Pesto Chicken Pizza($13): it was good, but I didn't think it was as good as the chipotle chicken.  Kung Pao Spaghetti($13): his little sister let the both of us try some and I was surprised that it tasted pretty good. It had that kung pao taste. Our server was very attentive as well. My bf and his sister drank a lot of water and there cup was never empty. So yay for the good service and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=20
Jimmy H.,"Buena Park, CA",937,444,757,4.0,12/24/2013,I love CPK. They have great salads and pizzas. Pretty much had all of their salads and I have to say I am impressed how good they are. Both presentation and flavors are always spot on. The pizzas are very good too for a chain place. The wild mushroom one is on the top of my list (make sure to add truffle oil).

Ria P.,"Corona, CA",363,125,3,2.0,8/19/2011,"50 % of the time that I come here I receive really horrible service and the other half of the time, I receive OK service.  We all know that the food here is great, but it's just a matter of how your treated that will make you want to come back or not. I'm almost tempted to put 1 star because of the last time I was here, but I 'll add another for the times that I did receive good service. It was a Wednesday night, not busy at all, and our server paid little to no attention to us. And whenever she DID some, she had a fake smile that she tried so hard to keep up whenever she came to our table. Granted I did come here for a business meeting and we had papers on our table, but that does not mean we do not want to be served. It took forever to get our order in and it took forever to get our food. We ordered a pizza and a salad. Shouldn't be too difficult right? I noticed the manager going around to other tables to ask how they were doing but not once did he stop by ours. Did we really look that busy? Anyways, I could've done without this horrible experience here, but with that in mind, I'll be a little more cautious of my choice in restaurant before I decide I'd like a good salad again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=20

Suzanne L.,"Covina, CA",65,162,78,3.0,4/27/2009,"You know what? CPK isn't so bad when you have a coupon. :D So right now, they're handing out those coupons at the end of your meal where a manager has to open it up in front of you on your next visit. We were there again on Saturday afternoon to redeem yet another coupon. We got the pear and gorgonzola pizza. It's got caramalized pears and fontina cheese, and they scoop a bunch of salad on top of the pizza with lots of gorgonzola. It's pretty good. It's like a 2 for 1 since we ate the salad on top first, followed by the pizza.  My brother ordered the miso seafood salad. It was the best part of the meal! It didn't sound too appetizing, but it was freaking delicious. There were large chunks of avocado, lots of edamame, daikon, cilantro, and crab. I could have done without the shrimp, but still. It's a really refreshing salad. We got a full order, but the 3 of us weren't able to finish it all. It's a bit pricey at around $15, I think.

My gf and I decided to try something different, she went with the Chile blah blah I don't even remember what it's called but I went with the sun dried pasta penne cream thing. The Chile thing was different, but it was good! Something I've never had before. My penne pasta was ok at BEST. Ordered chicken with it ($3 more ok no big deal right? Except, I counted like 7 TINY pieces of chicken. That coupled with a mediocre sized plate of pasta = I'm still hungry). My GF loves the mango/strawberry-iced-teas but our server mixed and matched them to perfection. He frequented our table and was always making sure we were satisfied with everything (I wasn't with the food but his exceptional service was a difference maker). Honestly, I can cook the pastas and the pizzas at home for far less than what CPK charges. However, the service here is fantastic, thanks to Manuel. Real cool, down to earth dude.

I would say the service is pretty good because our waiter Adrian made sure everything was all right. He also asked us if we needed extra napkins or any other condiments before he brought us our lunch. That's a plus to me! It is more convenient and you don't have to hunt down a waiter whenever you need something CPK has this new thing on their menu called small cravings. My sister got the wedge salad. I thought it was okay but I would get something else like the Mediterranean plate next time. We also ordered the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, and Chicken Marsala.

(""Its their own fault if the toilets get stopped up"").  I waited took care of business in the stall that had paper, washed my  hands and went out and asked where the paper was?   The waitress just shrugged her shoulder and said they are working on it, didn't seem to care in the least.   I found the manager and asked him if he knew about the situation and he said yes and that the Hostess (Male) at the door was going to bring some in but people kept on coming in.    WHAT ???  The manager was just walking around, do you think he could have stepped in at the front door .....   NO   I guess it was below his level.  Finally I took the paper out of the hostesses hand and gave it to the ladies in the restroom.   They were very appreciative.    If both rolls were out, in 2 almost 3 stalls, when was the last time anyone was in there to check out things   Not only that, but the soap dispenser was running low too.    DISGUSTING!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=40

The service and additional selections were a plus. Why can't this be every night?! Early dinner advantage-parking up front, no wait, prime seating. It's still considered Winter but the 89 degree temps made for a comfortable night to dine out in the patio.  We were given the special pre fixe menu and the regular menu. The pre fix was such a deal with an appetizer 2 entrees and a dessert for only $30. Unfortunately, we came in with predetermined options in our head and that was it. Starter was the steamed dumplings that stands great on its own. Can be filling if you eat all of it yourself. I haven't had the tequila lime chicken fettuccine in years. One of my favorite dishes that reminds me of the old and now defunct Crocodile Cafe in Pasadena. I asked to go light on the cream, so my chicken and pasta are not drowning in sauce.  I guess tequila is just part of the name now because I don't taste the tequila just the lime. It's all good though-yummy nonetheless. The chimichurri chicken and vegetables were a welcomed change for the palette. I had to reach with my fork for a taste. Perfectly cooked chicken and grilled veggies were fresh.  The chimichurri sauce was as green as pesto with a slight punch of heat.

Used a coupon for a free artichoke dip with $10 minimum purchase. My pizza go to order is always the California Club Pizza with honey wheat dough. Though I normally do not order appetizers but the avocado egg rolls are always awesome!  Price-wise, I still consider CPK's pizzas to be quite expensive for the portion but truthfully, it can be deceiving as well. Even with the size, we were quite full and even had leftovers.  Service was good, nothing extraordinarily special but the server was really attentive.

Looks like CPK is undergoing some changes with their menu.. my beloved cranberry walnut chicken salad sandwich is no longer available along with a couple other dishes! ): DEEEVVASSSTATTTIONNNN! boo. Our server, Eric, was very informative, funny, and patient with us. I guess he's been with the company for about five years now? he gave us the whole run down of the menu as to what was more popular and which ones he preferred. I would totalllly hire him I had a restaurant. just saying! Anyways, it took them a while to take our order this time around too ): My friend was STARVING! and it was funny cause we were joking that Eric could've put my friend's baby in danger!

Their dip just doesn't seem to come out as hot as I'd like it... everrr. But it was creamy and not too heavy. My friend liked it, lots. The california club pizza looked amazinggggg! I've had it before but I didn't have any this time around since I ate already. It comes topped with avocado, and shredded lettuce. Let's just say I got a thumbs up from m'friend (: yay! The score remains at 3 stars and the only reason why I even bothered mentioning the 0.3 is because of Eric's capability to dissect each and every dish we talked about as well as making us laugh.

I used to LOVE coming here a few years ago, but this past week's lackluster experience ruined years of being a happy patron for me. First off, the food. The food is what makes up 75% of a rating, and I must say I was sorely disappointed. We tried the spaghetti bolognese (pretty basic, so should be easy right?) and overall the dish was pretty plain. To begin with, there wasn't enough sauce for all of the noodles, but then again the sauce itself didn't have a very strong flavor to it, so I'm not it would have made a huge difference anyway. We also had the wild mushroom pizza. Taste-wise this dish was okay. The most disappointing thing is that the dish was cold. Finally, the nail in the coffin was the service, or lack thereof. Our server was inattentive and though we asked for a refill of lemonade twice, the refill wasn't given to us until after she gave us the check. 2 stars for CPK. If it weren't for the giftcard we used I'd probably be even more irked. We will most likely not be back. Sad sad days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina

Marie Y.,"Azusa, CA",114,155,13,5.0,5/4/2008,"Baby wanted cheese piiiiii-zza (that's how he says it) for lunch today.  So after we finished our errands at the West Covina mall, we headed for CPK. I ordered a small cheese for baby and the 1/2 chopped salad for myself.  When our food arrived, I took a small bite of baby's pizza to see how hot it was.  It wasn't piping hot, but comfortable enough for him to eat right away.  My salad, as usual, was good. We took a peek at the dessert menu too.  I would have liked to have had either the key lime pie, chocolate souffle cake a la mode, or the red velvet cake...but my stomach wouldn't have it. Service was good and baby finished all his pizza.  This baby momma couldn't ask for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Elijah Q.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",53,185,14,3.0,2/14/2011,"Been to this one many times with the family.And what jumps out at me is the decor inside as you walk in.I love the colors they have in their as well as the setup with the bar,the one thing i think it needs is more Tv's.They seem to be on one side of the restaurant. Service seems to be fair.Not bad and not awesome. The pizza which is about 11.50 per pizza...is somewhat feeling..I was still hungry..but then again my mama said i have whats called a high metabolism.Theres other things to choose from besides pizza like salad..but if im going to a steakhouse im not going there to get a salad..im getting   stick to the pizza..they have some awesome selections my fav is called the white pizza.One pizza i did not like is pineapple and ham very tasteless.Try the white pizza. Parking is better now that big boys closed   get thier is a little hasle alot of congestion.But once you get to CPK you will be ok.Enjoy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Sari H.,"La Puente, CA",123,14,1,3.0,8/22/2011,Never thought I would ever be interested in a grilled veggie sandwich like the one I had at CPK. LOVE IT! The service there though I can live without.

Joseph A.,"Walnut, CA",382,150,251,4.0,4/20/2008,"Having been to several CPKs all over the place, any sort of sense of wonder that I'd feel with regard to their unique novelty pizzas has been gradually fading over time. And, it's not because I think the pizzas are bad or anything.  It's mainly because I'm obsessed with one particular pasta dish on their menu: Kung Pao Spaghetti.  It features a classic Kung Pao sauce (of course) with garlic, green onions, peanuts and hot red chilies.  You can have it with chicken and/or shrimp. The Spinach Artichoke Dip served with tortilla chips is always a great starter.  For a place like this, the bread that they serve as complimentary always comes off as surprisingly underwhelming.  A place that does it's own pizza dough and puts out well-executed pasta dishes should be Jedi-status when it comes to all things carbohydrates.   Service has always been attentive during my visits.  The dining room has a pleasant decor, with light linens and dark woods that succeed at making the place feel warm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80

The place was not too busy and we received attentive service from our server. We tried a new pizza on their menu, the Buffalo Chicken with carrots, celery, blue cheese, and you guessed it, lots and lots of Tabasco sauce. It was spicy enough to get the sinuses going, but tempered by the ranch dressing that came on the side. We totally loved it. Will definitely be coming back here again in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80

Ocra G.,"Long Beach, CA",10,51,,2.0,4/19/2010,"This is a place the seems to be confused on plate size and menu size. All the pizzas just seem to have stuff that sound interesting but aren't practical. I can see how someone might want to have something out of the norm but whatever to you, why not just make a good pie. I and my girlfriend walked in on a not so busy thursday we got a table right away. The Expectations were to walk in with one and a half hours to get in and out, even have a beer or two. We waited a good fifteen minutes before one waiter noticed us. He only took our drink order as we waited for our real waiter. She showed put after we got our water and took our food order... it was the chicken pesto pizza. Our party of two then received our beer after our order went out, so i thought we were good on time. The waiters, as i watched them, all seemed to be doing less then they could be doing. One waitress was so backed up she had to bus her own tables, others just watched. Where is the team help? As far as plates go, it looks like when you order pasta they give you enough to eat take home and have a midnight entree. Same with the pies, i like to have pizza but it's about eleven inches, you don't need to eat that much. Bottom line, I don't think anyone should eat too much from out anyway. The only reason I was watching the waiters and other people was because it took close to thirty minutes for our pie which came and didn't look nice at all. It was to have sun-dried tomatoes which were not really there, hardly any basil, but we did get a hair on the crust. From the look of it, it might have been the server who brought it, but when in doubt throw it out. I didn't make a scene or anything, i just pointed to it and she knew right away what to do. Ten minutes later we got a fresh new pizza pie, this one was the one. All the product was there and the pizza even had a darker crust. Looked great, so... why couldn't they do it like that the first time. No manager came to talk to us and I wasn't ready to pay for a mistake and bad service, so we went to the manager. she found it fair to knock off a few bucks. I doubt i'll go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Ags P.,"Chino, CA",215,254,113,1.0,6/16/2008,"Wow, I can't believe I just had the most horrible CPK experience.  Never again, CPK WesCo, never again!   Okay, I can let things slide, if we don't have the greatest service sometimes.  It happens.  The first time my sister and I went to this CPK, she forgot her credit card in the bill fold thingy.  Hours after we'd left the joint, she calls CPK, and asks if they have her credit card.  She didn't explain what it looked like, or anything, they just said, ""Yes, we have your credit card.""  WTF?   Errrright.  When we went back to go pick it up, she walks in and says, ""Hi, I accidentally left my credit card here?""  The hostess just looks into a cubby, and just hands it to her!  No questions asked.  Nothing!  So of course, my sister immediately cancels her credit card, and asks for a new one.  Talk about security!  Thanks a lot, CPK! So then last night, my sister, my mom and I were discussing on what to have for dinner.  My mom says, ""CPK!""  Then my sister says, ""If we have CPK, I'm not paying, because of last time.""  Okay, understandable.  So, my sister, my mom and I went to have dinner @ CPK.  We waited for about 15 minutes.  It's father's day.  Understandable.  We figured, anywhere we went, there would be a wait.  We get seated, and order immediately.  We explain to the server that we not only want drinks, but we're ready to order.  The server explains that they're backed up in the kitchen, so everything's going to take a minute.  My mom asks, ""but we'll still get bread, right?""  The server says, ""Let me see what I can find.""  Wow, that doesn't sound too good.  Is she going to pull  a couple of pieces last week's bread, and put 'em together?   Okay, our order:  me and my mom split a Thai Chicken Pizza.  My sister has the half order of the new seafood miso salad.  After so many refills later...actually 45 (I clocked it, because the server said that things are backed up, so I was curious to see how much they were backed up) minutes later, the pizza comes out.  Server says she wanted to bring out the pizza, because she didn't want it to get cold.  Another 10 minutes after that...my sisters salad finally arrives.  FINALLY, we all get to eat.  OMG...55 minutes for 2 dishes?  Are you kidding me!?!?  When we're done, we're sitting there, waiting for the server to pass by, and we're discussing our food.  My sister explained that the crab in her salad tasted old.  Like it had been sitting out for a couple of days.  She also happened to have some sort of coupon, and hands it to our server.  It's sealed, and it says that someone from CPK is to open it.  So, the server looks at it and says, ""Oh, a manager would have to open the coupon, and see what you would be able to receive.""  REALLY?!  So...another 15 minutes to wait for the manager.  The server is profusely apologizing for our wait.  We see other parties coming to eat their meal and leaving.  All 3 of us were irritated.  It wasn't the servers fault at all, as she was hustling, and you can see that it was all out of her hands.   The manager finally arrives.  So, of course, she asks how we're doing, and my mom says, ""I'm pissed!""  My mom tells her the horrible time that we've had, how long we've been having to wait.  The manager just apologizes, and doesn't do anything more than that, and proceeds to open the coupon.  It turns out our coupon is 50% off.  So my mom says, ""Just give us the bill already.  Do what you need to do.""  The manager leaves to what I presume is to go find out how much our bill is.  I'm guesstimating $25 (for 2 dishes and drinks).  A couple of minutes later, the manager comes back and says, ""You know what?  I'm just going to take care of your bill.""  Big whoop.  She's taken care of our $25 bill.  We're like, ""okay,"" and stormed out. So a couple of hours when we got home. remember that crab that my sister was complaining about in her salad?  She broke out into hives that night.  NEVER AGAIN, CPK...NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Lauren X.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,365,514,4.0,7/1/2009,"love that this place is also close to yogurtland! Love this place, wait time usually decent, alot of parking avaiable, outdoor sitting not too bad...but it is by the parking lot so that could be a problem with exhaust and all.  I love the server, Britney. I have not seen her for a while but she is the BEST. So lucky if you have her as she is very attentive and will make sure your food is just perfect or else she will try to get you a replacement.  She was there when they first opened. The interior is a bit dim for some who like brighter lights, but overall it's great place. Expect to spend at least $15 though per person. And that is usually mininimum ;( The ""hockey puck"" dessert, Chocolate Soufflé Cake, is awesome. Although over the months i find the quality has gone down.  The souffle is more dry, harder, and just not as warmed as before.  The ice cream that goes with it is so wonderful.  Always a perfect ending for our dinner/lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Spencer B.,"West Covina, CA",38,54,,2.0,11/21/2008,"California Pizza Kitchen aka CPK is an extremely consistent eatery.  What I mean by consistent is that the service is slow at all of their restaurants.  Whilst sitting at the bar, it usually takes about 5-7 minutes to get acknowledged by the ""bartender"" and another 5-7 minutes to get a drink.  After which, you are asked if you would like some food.  Again, the food service is slow.  The pizza isn't dazzling, but it is definitely edible.  If you need a pizza fix, and there isn't anything else around, this is a good bet.  However, if there are any other pizza joints around, go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
Savanah D.,"Solana Beach, CA",1,56,6,1.0,1/23/2014,"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. The host didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He was going to seat us near a huge, loud birthday party (maybe 14 people), when there were tons of other empty tables everywhere else. We requested a different, quieter spot, and then sat at the table we picked. We had two different waiters. Our second waiter took his time getting our order in. We ordered something to go, and he placed the order. About fifteen minutes later, I see him folding pizza boxes on the other side of the restaurant. He did this for about 9 minutes. He brought our to-go pizza and it was the wrong pizza we ordered. So we sent it back, and got our correct pizza. If the people who work here were more people-oriented and seemed like they like working there, I think it would be a better place. I think the waiters and hosts don't really care that much about what the customers want! Not going back there. Also, everything is over-priced. $12 for a salad? We got one salad, two pizzas, and one beer. The total was about 60 dollars. You would think that when the food is that expensive, the service would be over the top, really nice. Not here. I'd rather go to Pizza Port in San Diego: 2 beers, 2 pizzas for about 40 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80

Laura V.,"West Covina, CA",0,28,1,2.0,12/20/2011,Formerly one of my favorite restaurants to visit in West Covina.  Recently the service and menu items are lacking.  The same staples like Chicken Marsala and Chicken Pesto Pizza that we have enjoyed for years are gone.  Not sure what is up with the Chicken Pesto Pizza leaving as they still show it on the menu and have ALL the ingredients for other dishes.  The curbside (which our office uses 3-4 times per month) ALWAYS has an error.  I do not know if there has been a local management change or if this comes from unfortunate changes at the corporate-level.  Today there were not even bags for our curbside order.  How can we take food home without bags?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80
