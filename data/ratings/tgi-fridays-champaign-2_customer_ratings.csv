Evidently it has been here operating for a couple weeks. Kinda surprised that they didn't have NTN Buzztime trivia to enjoy. Friendly staff as always.  Food was good. My steak was ordered MEDIUM. It arrived WELL-DONE. So it went back and was cooked properly the second try. The other the meals and appetizer was prepared properly and was highly enjoyable.  The server initially had a hard time keeping my coca cola full.  Had not my steak went back, they would have received 4 stars.

50,C L.,"Urbana, IL",0,5,,1.0,2012-12-31,"My friends and I visited this Fridays location around five thirty on 12/30/2012. This was perhaps one of the single most wretched dining experiences I have ever had.  I had been initially impressed by the renovation of the building, it looked quite nice inside. However, it  soon became clear that the staff was very very poorly trained. The waitress, though terribly sweet seemed lost in the menu. It took ages for the first wave of food to arrive at the table, and the kitchen sent out one entree ten minutes before the rest. Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us. When the bulk of the food did finally arrive,  it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food.  Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says ""OK! Have a nice meal""  It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal.  She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky.  She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer. She arrived at the table combative and rude. The way to handle a customer who is rightfully upset with their treatment is not to then embarrass them for complaining and still not comp their meal or even bother to offer any sort of *genuine* apology.  Pink sweater manager on duty. Please report to corporate for proper training on how to both run your restaurant, and deal with the unhappy patrons you have tortured. I paid for my meal, and tipped the waitress twenty percent, as it was not her fault that the manager had not correctly trained her. However, I would suggest avoiding this location at all cost until it  receives further training intervention on the management level from corporate. Had the manager been polite, and handled the situation properly, this review would have been unnecessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=40,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

As for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night.  But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in.  The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.  However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost.  We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu. Our appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips.  Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good.  My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back. Overall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon.  Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese  and cherry limeade slushes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=40,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

I immediately thought to myself ""damn are they closing?""  So I looked at the door to check the closing time, which was posted as 1AM!!! After saying Helllllo to them, a young lady then scurried over to seat us.   Not a whole lot of people were there (weather was awful that day) and again the waitstaff were just sitting around. NOT good.  A young lady finally came over to take our order for drinks and kinda just hung around looking at us.  I thought this was soo friggin wierd! We then proceeded to order an appetizer of the spinich and artichoke dip, when it came, the chips were burnt and hard as a brick! I immediately sent that crap back!  We get those back with fresh(er) chips but I still wasn't impressed by those. Our entress came and were ""alright"". My biggest complaint was about the waitstaff! (They were just sitting around looking at people like why are any of you here)! LOL  It's my assumption that the management had gone home for the day and they all just kicked back! This place had better get there service together and QUICK! This place is nothing like the old location, which was always a good experience.  But I'll be back, because I like Friday's food and I have some rewards that I need to spend.  LOL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

The decor is very nice and chic.  another thing I noticed was that it is not really loud inside like the old location.  At the old one I would have to yell in order to be heard.  it is all open and looks nothing like the Chevy's that used to be here. We ordered appetizers.  Some kind of chicken Asian skewers and loaded potato chips.  I loved the skewers.  They were made with cilantro and I love cilantro.  The Asian Cole slaw that came with the skewers was really good too.

It's not a bad restaurant/bar, it's just uninspired. I will say that this TGI Friday's makes very good drinks. My sister orders some sort of Grey Goose peach cocktail and it's always tasty. The food is again not amazing and usually overpriced for what is essentially meat and potatoes. Even as I type this I added a star for the drinks and the nice servers. I have a thing about people bothering me just enough as I eat and TGI Friday's has it down.

I've always had an issue with the service at this particular TGI. The hosts aren't the most friendly, service is ALWAYS slow. Don't expect refills. They're often understaffed.

The food was ""TGI Fridays quality,"" which is fine, but it certainly is not 5 star quality.  There is nothing to really add about the food.   But,  what stands out to me was the restaurant's ability to provide the appropriate seating, staffing, and handle our orders.   4 Stars for the great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

The mixed drink Diddy on the Beach had no pineapple which was in the the posted advertisement ,when asked the waitress said they didn't have any. The parking lot had trash and a dirty diaper on it.

I also ordered a Ceaser salad and it said that the salad came with a breadstick. When I received the meal there was tomato soup and a Ceaser salad and then the small order of nachos. The only reason they get 2 stars is because I liked their soup and luckily I had a breadstick from another restaurant that I had left orders from.
