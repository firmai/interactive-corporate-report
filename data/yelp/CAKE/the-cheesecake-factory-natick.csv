P. M. W.,"Ambler, PA",26,215,,4.0,7/3/2016,"We did take-out curbside.  The place is always packed with almost no parking available.  Which brings me to my first complaint:  The curbside take-away.  People park in the designated spaces and eat in the restaurant.  No one is towed (that we know-of) so the take-out ease is not there.  We finally found a space open and parked.  When I placed the order they didn't tell me I had to call them to let them know I was there.  I figured it out (I'm smart!) and they promptly brought-out the food.  Food was great, packed well.  But only two half-loaves of bread for five entrees ordered costing $120??  (And we asked for the bread)  Oh well.  We don't need the carbs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60

Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149,4.0,1/17/2016,"Their appetizers are phenomenal, I would honestly make the trip into Natick from Worcester just for Cheesecake Factory (and have). I somehow have made it this far in my life without trying their cheesecake which is one of the few regrets I have. Their pasta primavera is excellent. The dipping sauce for the tex mex eggrolls should probably be investigated by the DEA because it's so addictive.

Lauren G.,"Boston, MA",200,27,2,2.0,5/6/2016,Menu is huge so there is something for everyone. There is always a wait. We sat at the bar and waited for 10 minutes for one of the two bartenders to get our drink order. They were extremely busy making drinks for the entire restaurant so they had a hard time giving the customers at the bar good service.

Alex S.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,46,,3.0,1/11/2017,"Went there yesterday.  The food was still good, the waits were still long but overall worth it.  The only issue was with casadillas that we ordered.  They're made with chicken, peppers and maybe onions but my wife's vegetarian, so she wanted a vegetarian version of it.  Well, what they do is they simply remove the chicken and don't add anything else.  So what you get is tortillas with cheese and barely anything else on the inside.  She opened them up and there was maybe one piece of pepper and onion in each.  What was also annoying was when we asked for them to go they threw out all the side stuff...guacamole, pico de gayo, etc.  Why would they do that??  Make sure to check your to-go boxes or pack them yourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60
John J.,"Worcester, MA",0,2,,5.0,12/31/2015,"Everything was great, we started with the avocado rolls. If you have not had these, you should have these as soon as possible. For our main course we had the four cheese pasta with chicken and the Southern fried catfish. The catfish was not what I expected, but the four cheese pasta was delicious and I would highly recommend it. Our server was named Tim. He was very busy, however he provided exceptional service and was very attentive.  The atmosphere however could use improvement. It was very warm (hot), and very very very dark. We needed our cellphone flashlights in order to read the menu. The music was loud and distasteful, and was the low point of our visit.

Taryn S.,"Boston, MA",48,23,,4.0,1/15/2015,"Hi! my name is Emiko and i am one of Ms.Taryn's 3rd grade  student's. In my opinion, The Cheesecake Factory is an amazing restaurant. To start, they have a good menu with lots of choices to choose from. Secondly, it doesn't take a long time for the food to come. For example, have you ever gone to a restaurant and the food takes forever to come? Well every time I've been to The Cheesecake Factory, that didn't happen to me. Another reason I like The Cheesecake Factory is because they have great seating and will seat you in no time. Finally, they have amazing cheesecake that has creamy tastes and many cheesecakes to choose from. That's why I think The Cheesecake Factory is an amazing restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60

Our food was good, the guacamole appetizer was extremely fresh and my shrimp tacos were tasty for the ""skinnylicious menu."" However, the service wasn't great.

Loved the colorful and eye-catching interior design (do something most people don't do: look up at the great ceiling designs!). Service was fine. Food was nicely plated, filling, and affordable.

Jennifer R.,"Marlborough, MA",1,11,,1.0,4/15/2015,What a disappointment!! Maybe my expectations were too high since it was my birthday. The host couldn't have cared less that we were even there. He seemed put out that he had to interact with us.  It wasn't busy for a Tuesday night when we went but we had to wait for everything. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time at the tiniest table and the booths and larger tables were vacant. He was easily agitated when you asked to be seated somewhere else.  We waited and waited for everything to come out! Really slow service and I gave up on ordering a second drink even thought we spent 2 hours there.  Crusted Chicken Romano was barely cooked however the Thai Lettuce Wraps are fantastic! I decided that it wasn't worth waiting for the waiter to come back and ask if we wanted dessert so we asked for the check and left.  We go here for special occasions only but we won't be any longer. It's too expensive to get such lousy service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60
Skye G.,"Boston, MA",170,755,1750,3.0,3/31/2012,"I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I went with friends and was surprised at how much I really enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad. Their salads are huge and when it first arrived I figured I'd take some home for later but I ended up polishing off the entire plate. The also have a SkinnyLicious menu to pick from. The one thing I really didn't like was the book size menu.  It was very overwhelming to look at.  On one hand it made picking harder but on the other hand if you want options they are many. Parking at the mall and out in front is always tough.  I usually give up and park in the garage and walk rather than circling the lot. As for the actual cheesecake, they have many flavors and options but again I've never been a fan so I...who love dessert....skipped it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=60

We split the avocado eggrolls (a must-have) and ordered seperate entrees:  a lunch salad and the salmon special of the day. All were delciious - perhaps the eggrolls and the sald most of all.  A few asides:  The decor here needs an overall - it's bit much. Trippy, very 90s, and overdone. The bathroom also was a mess, which I let the staff know about.

Jess D.,"Farmington, ME",50,12,1,1.0,8/6/2016,"I was super disappointed a few days ago when my husband and I took my one year old there for dinner. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and just wanted a nice dinner out with my family before our new bundle arrived. We went on a night where it wasn't busy but our waiter still seemed to want to rush and brush us off.  He took mine and my husbands drink order and then tried to rush off before I got a chance to tell him my daughter would also like a drink! When we ordered our food I told him I have a gluten allergy, I wanted a gluten free burger cooked medium and fries, simple right? Wrong. He said ""a burger with blue cheese?"" Um no just a regular burger with regular cheese and a gluten free bun. When all our food finally came my burger was not on a gluten free bun, it was sent back and I was told a new one would take less than 10 min. Even the manager came over and apologized and asked if I'd like a salad in the meantime, I declined. More than 10 minutes passes, my husband and daughter are both finished with their meal, mind you my one year old was being exceptionally good but we all know that may not last too long! The waiter came back over and apologized again and said it wouldn't be long so I decided to order my daughter a scoop of vanilla ice cream to keep her happy, well my food finally came and it was WRONG AGAIN!! Wrong burger and it was very rare not medium, if I weren't so pregnant it wouldn't have been as big a deal. I looked at my husband told him I was all set and to get the bill, I wasn't going to make my daughter, who STILL hadn't received her ice cream wait any longer. My pregnancy hormones took over and I had to get up and leave. I told my husband to make sure they didn't charge us for my meal or the ice cream. Well they took my meal off and offered my husband a free piece of cheesecake which he declined because my daughter and I were waiting in the car but they left her ice cream on the bill! Needless to say I left in tears and still hungry! They should have comped our whole meal or offered us a gift card.

Sparky S.,"Medford, MA",2,40,16,1.0,7/18/2017,"My worst service experience ever at a Cheesecake factory. can't help post this for others to learn from our experience and go in prepared. We were out there to celebrate a birthday and had planned and pre-ordered the cake as a surprise. We came ahead before our dinner and checked with the bakery to make sure our cake was ready. Later we asked our server privately(to maintain the surprise) to bring in the cake at the end of our meal. Now this is what happened: 1). After our appetizers r done, the lady from the bakery comes over to the table asking if we ordered the cake n wanted it to be served. so there goes the surprise down the drain!!.we just stared in shock and said no. I then went to the server n told him about this and all I got was, ""I don't know what the bakery lady was doing at your table""... that's it. not even an apology for ruining our night. 2). next was the service nightmare. Our entrées r here and the server hasn't cleared the empty bread basket, the appetizer dishes, side plates. we just push things around to make room for the entrées. two in the group were sharing a entrée and we mentioned it when we ordered and all he brought was the entree plate. we had to ask twice for him to bring a plate for them to eat from, and then he just got 1!! and had the nerve to joke saying ""we r making him do multiple runs to the table"".... seriously!!! just do your job properly in the first place, so that we don't have to keep reminding you of what needs to be done. we ask him to clear the dirty side plates, still no action. just walks away. Towards the end of the meal, the server comes over and asks if he could take our plates out of the way, this is while we were still working through our meal! we asked him to clear the appetizer dishes which were still on the table. he said ok and walked away as if ""it's not my job"". when he later came to clear the dishes, we told him to clear the table before he brought the cake(now that there is no surprise with the cake, we could just tell him what he should have known n done in general). he still left the dirty appetizer side plates on the table. we reminded him again when he was walking by...just an ok, no action. After 15mins of wait, he then just brought the cake n we had to make room pushing the dirty dishes to the side of the table while they sang the birthday song.he tossed some new side plates for us to share the cake, we had to ask him again to bring some spoons!! r we supposed to dig in with our hands!? we again asked him to clear the dirty appetizer dishes, all he did was pick one and leave. he comes around in few mins, tosses an empty cake box and the check. ...did we ask for the check?NO!! coz we were still working on the cake on our plates. anyways, we paid our check, left a tip. noticed that they did not add the price of the cake, thought maybe they were making up for their goof-up and it was on the house. courtesy sake we asked to confirm n learnt that this was not the case. an argument ensured between the server and the bakery on who was supposed to charge the cake to the check. finally paid for the cake at the counter. mentioned to the server again on how disappointed we were that they ruined our surprise n all we got was ""you know that mistakes happen"". Yes, we know!! but doesn't one appolgize for it!! anyways we left without asking for a manager (who was never to be seen anywhere when all this happened), we didn't want to stick around anymore n further ruin the birthday for the person in the group. Seriously the worst service I ever saw. will still go to other cheesecake factories....but never ever to the one at Natick Mall!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40
Summer P.,"Natick, MA",0,12,6,2.0,8/13/2017,"Totally disappointing lunch. First I'd like to say the greeters and our server were top notch. That's where my positives end. Our table was in the back by the bathrooms (which were very clean) which is cool, they were busy, but the sparkling water glass (wine glass) was filthy, there was a hair on my napkin, crumbs (not ours) on an appetizer plate, and the whole time there were fruit flies or gnats flying around our heads, it was super distracting. I ordered the veggie burger, and kids Mac n cheese for my kid (I didn't eat anything else so I won't comment on the rest). The ""burger"" was a patty of flavorless rice mush. Of which I took one bite (sans the mcdonalds-esq dyed pickles I couldn't stomach the look of them), I have never had such a bland mushy veggie burger. I get it, it's veggies and rice, but even if I could do the mush, there was zero flavor.  I was very disappointed it fell far far below my expectations of a lunch plate.  I didn't eat it so it was comped, unfortunately I was starving so my mood was a negative 11. The child's Mac n cheese was very bland and greasy, I stirred and stirred and couldn't get any ""cheese"" to stick to the noodles. Poor kid forced herself a bite, then I tried it and completely understood her aversion, again zero flavor, not even a salty flavor, no cheese flavor, it was kind of ridiculous. We got up and went next door to wait while the rest of our party finished (sandwich and salad) which they seemed ok with, eating half of (no to-go containers so obviously it wasn't delish). The water tasted funny. This place has really let its standards slip. We contemplated the cheesecake but I was sort of disheartened by the whole experience and just wanted to be done. You know when you spend all morning running errands and you just want a yummy lunch? Yeah that's all I wanted. I hate to nitpick but omg I was so sad I left hungry, it used to be such a great place. Kudos for not charging me for the ""burger"", but 2/4 meals edible isn't exactly a good enough record for me to come again. Our server was a peach though, above standard service on her end (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40

Anthony H.,"Largo, FL",113,164,224,1.0,3/11/2016,"HOLY SMOKES! I have to say, I've always heard excellent things about the Cheesecake Factory. Some good friends of mine eat at TCF often. Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj. So I figured as I love cheese cake and the place gets a bit of publicity from The Big Bang Theory. I would give it a shot! As a major yelper it slipped my mind to even look them up before we went. Boy I wish I had checked it out. So let me just give an entire meal and post meal summary. So it started out after the love and I's trip to Natick Mall we were super excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake... Like LOVE cheesecake. So after our shopping bout we ended up at our lunch destination. Our waiter was relatively nice. He was prompt with refilling drinks which was nice, but that was all for nothing when he would grab my half full cup without saying a word and run off at lightning speed. Okay so cut him some slack he's just doing his job. But when comes back to give my drink back he just runs off, even though I tell him thank you he doesn't acknowledge that I even said it. ( Its extremely important to note that I don't say thank you for personal gain or for better service. I have the utmost respect for waiters and waitresses and I know from experience that a simple thank you can turn a day around). That much I can look past when it comes to reviewing an restaurant. The food is really what matters the most.  So I guess the part you've been waiting for. When I tell you about the food poisoning I got. So our food came out and it looked very good and well presented. Which was expected as this place was a little on the pricier side. My lovely lady got herself some steak tacos. Everything appeared to be already pre cooked and really just thrown together from the fridge or something and heated up a bit. Which was extremely disappointing. Me on the other hand. My Fish and Chips lunch looked very good. I remember a few bites in saying I wasn't so sure about this fish. God I wish I was more sure and had it returned because I then spent almost a full 24 hours after that throwing up every hour on the hour with the most vigorous case of the runs happening simultaneously. Now I suppose this could of been a super stomach bug. But with the way things went down it seemed doubtful. I don't generally get sick often and keep my body and tip top working order.. So yeah I was disappointed... OH LOOK, HERE COMES SOME MORE. If you're from the Worcester area you'll get that reference: love business TV commercial. Anyways... Onto the cheesecake. As mentioned I love cheesecake and wow was I NOT BLOWN AWAY AT ALL. This was the worst cheesecake I've ever had in my life. It was Lukewarm and falling apart. I'm honestly blown away by the whole experience as I've been talking about coming here for years solely for my love of cheesecake. So needless to say I had quite an experience.

We had a party of 6, but they decided it would be wise to bring each meal separate.  Once 5 meals were there, they told us they had an issue with the last dish, it would be another 15 minutes. This was done by the manager which was nice, not the waiter who made the error. The waiter actually tried to avoid our table likely because he didn't want to share the bad news.

I usually get one of their pastas either the chicken marsala or pasta da vinci. The pasta is always cooked perfectly and the chicken is always juicy. Other honorable mentions would be the chicken littles or the avocado egg rolls. I am never disappointed. The best part of all is the cheesecakes! They are all so good! BUT THE BEST IS THE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE. It is my favorite chocolate cake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40
Patrick B.,"Framingham, MA",40,28,19,4.0,8/25/2016,"They never disappoint you and so simple to over indulge.  Parking can be a bitch as it is in a mall. Get here early so you can fight the teens and the cinema crowd.  The ""skinny"" menu is quite different from the main menu and in some ways cheaper too.  Had the turkey burger, wasn't too bad.  Fresh sweet potato fries hit the spot as well.

Sarah C.,"Worcester, MA",216,373,215,4.0,1/4/2013,"Oh glorious clog my heart and stuff me like a pig cheesecake factory I do love you.... I don't care what anyone says I will admit my love for you.  I know lots of people talk bad about this place and how bad the food is for you and so on... but if you know that and choose to go here every once in a while what is the big deal? It's not like this is my nightly or even weekly or monthly dinner spot... The menu here is insane making it extremely hard to chose what you want.  I have never had a dish from this location that I didn't like or that didn't come with enough food on to feed my whole table. They have really great appetizers.  The buffalo blasts are the best thing on the menu.  I love the chicken romano, meatloaf and so on.  I think that even though they have a huge menu the items always seem fresh and tasty. They make really good drinks here... a bit pricey but oh so worth it.  I love their mojitos and for brunch one Sunday the bartender made me an awesome peach bellini on the rocks. I don't usually actually come here for the cheesecake but it is pretty good.  I would recommend one of their actual cake slices over the cheesecake. Parking is a nightmare.. $7 for valet ... I wouldn't do it anywhere else but here because I want to enjoy my night out and not start out stressed and pulling my hair out! Oh yeah... be prepared to wait usually at least an hour any time around lunch or busy dinner nights!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=40

Sara S.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,1/23/2017,"I normally don't take the time out of my day to write a review. Today I was just a tiny bit bothered. I walked into the restaurant and went to the pick up area the employees name was Ronny C he was on the phone so I stepped to the side so he wouldn't feel rushed  and be able to finish what he was doing. With that Ronny C did not bother to just give me any type of jester to let me know he would be with me shortly. No big deal! As I waited another man walked in and Ronny C had just wrapped up his phone call looked over to me then immediately asked the man how could he help him today? That to me was a little confusing, Being that I was there first and waiting. Yet again I waited. When the man was done I moved in front of the counter. A woman walked and in started to place her order Ronny C not intervene she realized it and stopped self then said for me to go ahead.Ronny C then took my name and found my order. He said its $16.00 I handed a 20 dollar bill to him. My $4.00 change he placed in on the side of the register and went along to service the women. I stopped him and said with customer service you are never to put someone's money that placed money into your hand on the table it's very rude and very disrespectful. He was shocked! I hope from this someone will help you properly turn that attitude you have around. I know everyday is not a great day but you work in a place that welcomes all types of people.

Joanna R.,"Portland, ME",140,223,3360,4.0,1/7/2018,"We have been to this location once and overall it was fine and what I would expect from a large chain. It's located at a very busy shopping location which has also been my past experience. With that being said, if you don't like crowds, don't come here, it is wall-to-wall people. Park in the lot or the garage - parking is ridiculous and annoying in the holiday season. Be patient. We arrived shortly after 11am during the week and it wasn't crowded ...yet. We were seated within a couple of minutes. If you are in a party of 2, you will definitely seat faster than the larger groups. The host was meh, he wasn't friendly, but was prompt in addressing groups. He was more business than customer service. That's fine, he was just moving the human cattle through to their seats. Our server greeted us with a smile and was pleasant. Not over the top and not too verbose. She was great throughout the entire experience. Keep our drinks filled, checked in with us the appropriate amount of time, we never felt we had to look for her. I observed her with other customers and she was great and they seemed to be pleased with her as well. The food was what we expect, a lot and decent. The starting bread...perfect as always, it's unlimited, so don't hesitate to ask for me, but don't fill up if you ordered and entree, unless you are ok with taking leftovers home. They are consistent with the burgers and fries. You can customize them, from temperature to toppings. The toasted buttered bun, YUM! Don't forget to listen for the specials from apps to soup to entree to dessert. We ended up getting the special cheesecake, pumpkin pie pecan cheesecake. Wow, it was pretty good. Overall, for our only experience, it was a good experience and if we are in the area, we would definitely go back. A lot of options for everyone in your party, just be prepared to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick

It was so loud my friend looked at me and asked if I was grinding my teeth. No, friend - there was glass in my food. Lovely! I immediately notified staff and was given a huge apology, and corporate (from California) ended up calling me, apologetic about the issue. My advice: Do not come here. Do not waste your money.

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566,4.0,10/15/2017,"My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory always range. Even though it should be, nothing is ever exactly consistent.  Well, the real reason for only four stars versus five is because of the chefs. Unfortunately, the chefs at the Natick location have a few lessons to learn still... maybe they are just less experienced than those in Chestnut Hill or maybe it was an off day. Just to note, cheeseburgers should never ever be coated all around the edges with cheese. It looked like they actually had the nerve to place at least three pieces of cheese on my burger. I actually had to take my silverware and get some of it off, because it was just way too much. I am willing to give them another go though.  With that said, service all around was spectacular. Meghan was very friendly and attentive to our table. She was consistent and efficient, which was great. The host was also fabulous. Even with the crowds and crowds of people waiting around at the Cheesecake Factory, she was very efficient and organized in keeping everyone moving along efficiently. Seating is comfortable and overall the decor of the Cheesecake Factory is phenomenal. It's like a palace in a sense.  The complimentary bread is delicious and the quality of the food is very good. I had a small issue with much too much cheese on my burger, but overall, my meal was still pretty good.  I would come in the future as I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory over the years, mainly on holidays. We have stopped coming here on holidays due to the congestion and long, long wait times (which are present very frequently at nearly all the Cheesecake Factory locations).  Either way, this is a decent restaurant in the Natick Mall, but not the absolute favorite of mine, especially considering all the options. 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick

We had a 2 hour wait to be seated, luckily the mall is there. That being said the meal was really good. I ordered the herb-crusted filet of salmon. It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The middle was rare which is fine with me but perhaps not others. The mashed potatoes, asparagus, and lemon sauce were tasty accompaniments.

Shauna L.,"Leominster, MA",30,128,241,1.0,7/8/2017,"I think this chain restaurant was great way back when it began. But now..... It's just overrated and over priced and really nothing special at all!  We decided to come here because we hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in some time and my husband and friend have a sweet tooth that rules their world.  Bad choice on my part I guess.  We shared a few apps and since they were all pretty much nothing special I pulled the trigger and said we would go elsewhere for our mains.  We got: the chicken pot stickers. These were basically the frozen pot stickers that you can buy at your local supermarket. Doughy and filled with a mushy slimy chicken glump.  The loaded tater tots. I had one and one was too many. They were just a tasteless lump of mushy mashed potato (where was the ""loaded"" part) and the sour cream was literally frozen! There was a huge glump of frozen sour cream in the middle of the bowl and the rest was just a thin liquid. Ick!  The last item was a crab(less) cakes. Seriously. Where was the crab? Was it replaced with bread and bread crumbs?! No taste and just a mushy mess. No thank you!  The guys couldn't leave without have a piece of cheesecake. I mean that's what this place is called right.... So it's gotta be good.  One got the Godiva chocolate and the other the a snickers or something. Both said it wasn't something they HAD to have again.  3 apps. Two glasses of wine. 1 draft beer. And 2 mojitos. Total. Too much! $102 bucks and not including the tip.  I can't stand how these restaurants charge so much for frozen gross food!  Not worth it. Never again.

Chau L.,"North Reading, MA",15,130,211,3.0,5/19/2017,"This location was my first Cheesecake experience. My foodie life all started here first.  Came here on a Friday evening with my GF. There was no wait time and that was very surprising because we came around 6. It was so nice out so we chosen our door dining. The service was good,  but not our waitress. She was kinda slow. It probably took her about 15 mins to get our drink because she was busy talking to her workers and we can see it all from where we were sitting.  I had the fried fish taco with double cilantro lime rice with no beans. I was blown away from the serving size. It came with 4 delicious fish tacos and a massive size of rice. The tacos were absolutely amazing. It had perfect beer batter and great flavors. The fish taco had cabbagewith purple onions that had seasoning on them, pico de gallo and topped of with avocado. Even the soft taco shell tasted delicious. The rice was very good with a ton of flavor.

First of all when he brought our beverage my husbands wasn't what he ordered so the server said he would go get the right one, which he did about 10-15 minutes later. Then he brought us bread and butter. We went to butter a piece of the bread and neither one of us had a knife so we used our fork to try and spread the butter. He finally came back and took our dinner order and I asked him for a couple of knives which again we never got!! Well now here comes our dinner and again I asked for knives again and he said oh shit I'm sorry!! And walked away so we assumed he went to get the knives, Nope! Now I am so upset at this point.

We visited around 3:45 pm, which was apparently around when shifts change. We were greeted by our first server, who brought us water, our drinks and bread. We ordered food, and everything was fine. About 10 minutes after taking our order, our server introduces another woman who would be taking over, and reassured that our food had been ordered and be ready. Our original server then came back about 5 minutes later and told us that she had introduced the wrong person to us, and that our server was another guy. Meanwhile we were waiting and waiting for our food. The table next to us, had ordered their food at the same time, ate, and paid their bill before we even got our lunch. I finally got the attention of our third server and mentioned the fact that we had been waiting and the table next to us was done with their lunch when we ordered about the same time. Our food eventually came out another 5 minutes later. I think in total we waited 35 minutes for a salad and a burger. Yes, a salad and a burger. Our third server was just not very good. He never apologized for the delay. He didn't check our ask if how our food was. He never refilled our water. We ordered cheesecake, and he didn't offer to comp dessert.

Chandra J.,"Dallas, TX",153,225,162,4.0,1/28/2017,"Was craving a burger and had heard for years that Cheesecake Factory had some of the best burgers! So, a few friends and I headed there last Saturday night and enjoyed ourselves. We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it as we were sat at a large round table in a quieter section of the restaurant. Our waiter quickly came over amd took our drink orders. He was very nice, brought us some of their extra wheat and sourdough bread, and just overall made us feel very welcomed. As always Cheesecake Factory does not fall short when it comes to their food selection and portion sizes. I was so happily overwhelmed by the number of appetizers, salads, entrees, sandwiches, and pastas they had listed on their menu. I came in with the idea that I wanted a burger, but their salmon and chicken dishes were calling me. However, I stuck to my plan and got their mushroom burger.  This burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was big, but not too big and stuffed with crisp lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and mushrooms, and a sweet and tangy aoli sauce. I did not want the burger to stoo, but unfortunately my stomach had other plans and stopped it for me. I ended up taking half of it home along with the broccoli that I ordered as a side (i love that they did not charge me for subsituting the side like a lot of restaurants do). The minus one star came from the cheesecake as it was not as rich and decadent as I remember it being. Definitely fell flat in the taste and size department, but still had the $8 price tag. I hope that this was just a one time incident as I usually love their cheesecake, but not this time.  4 stars for the service and the food--minus the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick

Angela S.,"Boston, MA",119,117,173,2.0,8/16/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite go to place for a lunch with a friend and/or a romantic dinner with my boo! Their menu is endless and I always try something new every time I go!  Food: This time I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It's basically white rice with chicken and shrimp, with Thai curry sauce and coconut shredding. Delicious.  Service: I don't remember our waiter's name but he was alright. He was good till the very end. He gave us the bill, we looked at it, looks good, ok, charge! Gave it back to us and the bill amount increased. He had forgotten to add a side dish that we ordered. Granted, that we didn't notice it either however as a courtesy he still should've came and notified us what he was adding before automatically charging it on our credit card! I thought that was not right at all so that is why they deserve two stars for my recent experience! Not to mention two weeks ago, I had ordered strawberry shortcake for take out and when I opened the container there was a small cockroach under the biscuits. I quickly took it back (which was no more than ten minutes) and the manager came and said ""That's weird. This never happens."" I felt like she was accusing me instead of being apologetic. I don't think I would put a cockroach in in my own food, what do I get out of it? She asked if I wanted new biscuits. Uh no, how about my money back?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=20

We ordered 3 apps to share: the Cuban rolls, fried mac n cheese and the French country salad. The salad lacked dressing and didn't have enough pecans, asparagus or beets. The other items were EXTREMELY greasy/oily. Like pools of oil in the bottom of the cast iron dish (rolls) and AROUND the vodka sauce under the mac n cheese balls. The Cuban rolls became soggy and ""wet"" from sitting in their own grease. (I'm obviously not complaining from some pretentious ""health perspective"", we ordered fried food. But it should have been drained and plated properly). The apps just lacked flavor overall and nothing stood out.  I decided to venture out beyond my standard Godiva cheesecake order and we tried the s'mores cheesecake. Awesome! Only good thing! HOWEVER, we asked the remaining cheesecake be boxed and waitress got marshmallow on EVERYTHING. The container, the bag, ICK!! Opened it up later on and looked like a bomb went off.

She was a typical sensitive millennial girl so of coarse she ran away upset to get her manager rather than tackle a situation on her own. Out comes the manager and I said I called 6 minutes ago and she said the place was empty now it's a wait? He said sorry I don't know what to say? I said you people lie on the phone to get people in here and that's not right. It's impossible that it filled this quickly. He smirked and said sorry rather than fixing the problem.

I hate the decor.  It's outdated and borders on tacky.  It's also very crowded and loud.  And they don't take reservations which annoys me.  If you're trying to plan a birthday dinner or other special get together, the no reservations policy crosses them right off my list.  Nobody wants guests to show up and have to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a table.   The food is well prepared, but they sometimes miss the mark on temperature.  Very inconsistent in that department.  Their cocktails are generous and really good.  Bottom line is that the food portions are good, but the quality vs. price needs to be balanced better. As for their cheesecake, that is also hit or miss.  It's pretty good, but I swear the whipped cream on mine had the taste of spray whipped cream.  I expect real whipped cream for the price and their signature.  Boooo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=80

Having to cram your winter jacket into the already tiny booth is not pleasant. Or maybe they'll sit you on that SUPER AKWARD row of tables where you're a mere inches away from the strangers dining on either side of you. It is so uncomfortable. It's almost exactly like a community dining experience, except here you have to consciously try not to hit your neighbor with your elbow when you're cutting your steak and also pretend not to notice the people on the other side of you talking about contraceptive methods or something else equally unappetizing. There is no privacy at these tables. To be fair, the community table thing is a feature at all Cheesecake Factory locations, not just this one.  On my last few visits to this location, the food has been overwhelmingly mediocre. This isn't just a complaint from me, it's from my friends as well. A few bites into our respective meals last night were all followed by ""this isn't as good as last time"". The Cheesecake Factory isn't what I would consider cheap, so i'd suggest saving your money to dine elsewhere.  Silver lining- the cheesecake is always delicious. Grab a slice to go.

Elizabeth G.,"Framingham, MA",0,19,,3.0,4/27/2014,"A mixed bag. Something that baffles me about the Cheesecake Factory is how long the lines are on weekends. You could have up to a 2-hour wait. I mean, the Cheesecake's food is all right, but to me it's not worth waiting 2 hours (or even an hour) for. There seems to be a lot of hoopla about the Cheesecake Factory in general, and I kinda don't get why. Maybe it's because--to their credit--they have a menu option for everyone. Vegetarian, heavy meal, light meal, meat, fish, salads, you name it.  Their Sunday brunch is great--in fact, if you don't want to wait forever to get a table, I'd suggest going here for Sunday brunch before the Natick Mall opens, have your brunch, and then go shopping. Beat the rush. If you get a booth here during busy hours, you're in luck. The booth seating is great for conversation and provides a buffer from the restaurant (when the restaurant's going full-tilt, it gets pretty noisy and chaotic). On the other hand, if you get one of the tables in the middle of dining area during busy hours, you'll be yelling at your dining companions and competing with the conversations from neighboring tables.  The food is average to average-plus. I've tried a lot of different things on their menu, and my favorite lunch/dinner dish is the Tomato Basil Pasta. Soooooo good, and it makes for delicious leftovers. In the winter, I like Chicken & Biscuits.

Some drinks are very pricey at $10 to $12 a glass. My husband and I both had beers at half those prices. He ordered the chicken maderia and loved it. I ordered the crusted chicken romano. I did not care too much for the spaghetti and sauce. There are so many choices. Coffee was great and so was Linda's Fudge Cake. That was the best chocolate cake. There is enough for 2. I would go here just for it. Space is tight so it's good to be thin. I had leftovers and my husband did not. Mine was great the next day. We will probably return. It is outside our area and we usually cook. I will probably go back to their menu for inspiration.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=120

I recently visited Cheesecake factory on a second date. It was the worst that I could have done! We sat at the bar because the wait was very long. We ordered a modified appetizer that didn't come out right but whatever we dealt with it. We put in an order for some food I put in a salad in which I specified I needed it modified and no wontons etc. and date got his normal meal. When My food arrived the salad was no where near modified. it came just as it was on the menu me being a vegetarian I sent it back and asked for it to please be modified as I asked for it if it was possible. they left my dates food. and we waited for my salad. his food got colder and colder. finally my salad arrives. It comes with meat and no dressing on the side at all. I just looked at my date and said ok now what. The bartenders are mumbling to themselves and looking and annoyed when I tell them I am so sorry but there's meat on the salad I cant eat it that way. They start complaining to the servers about me to the point the servers from the service bar start looking my way it was embarrassing. Never mind the fact that the manager comes over and he SCOLDS ME!!! for having to the salad over again! I don't know which one was worst! he tells me he doesn't want to make it again if its not gonna be right. This is 10 minutes after my salad has already gone back to the kitchen so I am thinkin they are already working on the new one. But the manager tall skinny guy talked to me in such a horrible manner I just said to him nicely. Don't worry if the salad is not being made  ill just grab something somewhere else or later no big deal. He says okay ill check the kitchen. Comes back 10 minutes later I am thinkin he has my salad. NOPEEEE he comes to tell me oh the kitchen never started your salad so we just didn't make it again okay! I was like okkaaayyyy!!!

H P.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",2,77,,2.0,1/12/2014,"Well I must say this is a very popular place at least on a Saturday.I like to go weekdays but I had given my daughter an Xmas gift certificate to the Cheesecake Factory and unbeknown to me she had given me the same gift certificate .My daughter has kids that go to school so it had to be Sat .I suggested 5pm before the crowds arrived ,but the crowds had arrived ,in fact a 50 min wait and they told me to come back for a vibrator in 1/2 hour because they were out.I must say The Cheesecake Factory is not concerned with your comfort as you wait with only about 8 seats to sit.Plenty of space at the bar though.I had eaten here about a year ago and found the menu was extensive .The service was good and my wife ordered Shrimp Primavera while I ordered a combination dish ,Encrusted Salmon & Steak Diane .While we were waiting for the meal my wife & I ordered Lemonade ,very sour and expensive too $4.50.The food came out and my wife's dish looked good but she complained that the shrimp was not as fresh as she had at Captain Marden's in Wellesley 2 days ago ,which was a lot cheaper than here .My dinner the Encrusted Salmon was just ok ,however the Steak Diane  was so stringy through and through ,I could barely chew it . Recently I'm finding it's so hard to find a decent Filet Mignon that is not stringy ,chewy.I reviewed the Capital Grille recently and ordered a $62 steak ,potatoes and greens extra,which was very stringy ,downright robbery to charge for a bad meal .Since this restaurant is named The Cheese Factory ,we ordered cheesecake .We cringed at the price $7.95 for a slice .The cheesecake was quite good and filling ,but not worth the price .You can go to Trader Joes and buy an 8"" New York cheesecake as good as any I have ever had for around $8 .So looking around the crowd was thinning out .I was not so happy with the meal ,in fact it was very ordinary .It's attraction, I think they cater to every whim ,my daughter had a Club Sandwich and salad my grand kids had Hamburgers .All in all a very ordinary meal for what we went through to get seated ,just not worth it . I wont be back ,but I said to my wife ,give them an ordinary meal ,over charge ,serve the meal in a nice place which it is ,and they will come ,not me ,I've had it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=120
Taco E.,"Framingham, MA",5,63,5,3.0,3/14/2012,"I am a fan of this Cheesecake Factory although I do have one big complaint: the water. It is chlorinated (aka TOILET WATER) and just plain disgusting. I like to have a water when I order an alcoholic beverage and this place just doesn't do it for me. You'd think they'd have decent water by how 'fancy' the place seems. Everything else is great, I would just stay away from the water. I warned ya! Other than that, the alcoholic beverages are fantastic and always good, the food is GREAT, always consistent, always huge portions; although the menu is way too big and I often find myself and others taking forever to decide on what to get. The cheesecake is amazing..I always get the carrot cake cheesecake but have had others and they are all yummy. Appetizers are really really great as well; I recommend the buffalo blasts, nachos, mac and cheese balls, and the asian potstickers. The parking situation is not ideal and I usually have to end up parking at the mall, unless I am there during later hours. The wait time is usually 30-40 min if you have a group, unless you're there at dinner time, it could be much longer then. I recommend going after 8:30 pm or noon-earlier to miss the rush.

My mom didn't see that he gave us the wrong the check. The check he gave us $121 and the one we were supposed to have was $50.

I initially ordered the SkinnyLicious Herb Crusted Salmon, but the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell me that the restaurant doesn't have anymore salmon. It was only 8pm, so I was disappointed that they ran out of salmon already. However, the waitress suggested the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, which I ended up enjoying. The ahi tuna was a little overcooked, but I really liked the wasabi vinaigrette that came with it. I normally feel guilty eating at the Cheesecake Factory, but this time I actually didn't feel bad. I was pretty full after eating my entire entree, so I ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake to go. When I got around to eating it, it tasted yummy as expected.

Krista J.,"Acton, MA",0,5,,2.0,4/26/2015,"I've been to this location many times, and always a fan. My visit yesterday proved me otherwise. Jackie, our server, was great! Food wise - not good, not bad. My eggrolls were scorched, and not in the best way. The alfredo was SO SALTY. I chose not to send it back (time constrictions), but still wouldn't feed it to my dog. The chocolate mousse cheesecake...certainly not to die for this time. I couldn't finish it. I was pretty bummed that I spent $80 for the quality of food I ordered...less than an hour after you opened. I would have paid less than $25 for that entire meal, definitely not worth the value.  Now here's the part that would prevent me from ever coming again - my sixth month old son needed a diaper change. I walked into the bathroom to find that there was no changing table in the stalls. I don't think I saw a ""family bathroom"", and I didn't have time to search for this changing table, as my little guy NEEDED to be changed asap. So I did so on the bathroom floor (in a stall) and what do you know, he shit right up his back. Lots of it. All over his onesie. Unfortunately, I left his spare clothes in our car, parked on the other side of the mall. No time to run all the way over there. So, diaper changed, poop-covered onesie stored in the bag, and the little man is shirtless and dressed in his pants - thank god I had a blanket at our table to swaddle him in. And what do I hear on my walk back to the table? A group of servers walking past me, and in the background ""Why doesn't that baby have a shirt on?"".  Note to management: inform your servers that making comments about your customers, whether they are in the restaurant, just walked by, or just left...IS NOT APPROPRIATE! Somebody will always hear you, not to mention the amount of disrespect that goes along with it.  Good luck to that server when she has a kid and forgets to pack diapers in the diaper bag, or runs out of formula when she has a hungry, screaming baby, or can't sleep for weeks straight when her child is teething. Keep your comments to yourself as a server in a popular, constantly busy franchise restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=100

Manager tells us the same story and says it will only be few minutes as they are already making another one without mushrooms like we asked, but as he finishes the sentence another guy brings over my wife's ""freshly cooked dish"". Seems awfully fast but what do we know. Well, within few seconds it was rather clear that the mushrooms were simply picked out and this is not a freshly cooked dish like the manager claimed.  Didn't have the time to deal with this useless manager and simply took my wife's dish and gave her mine chicken romano. The problem is that she's allergic to mushrooms.

We ordered everything we always order in chestnut hill only to be disppointed everytime. The white bread served in the basket was hard as a rock when we asked the waiter for fresh bread he said that's the new artisan bread and that's how it is.. And we insisted that he was wrong soo he went back and brought fresh soft bread.  I ordered my usually Renee's special chicken salad sandwich only to be left in disappointment... The chicken salad was drenched in mayo the portion was tiny (nothing compared to chestnut hill) the Mexican chicken soup was tasteless .. Tasted like plain water with just beans n tortillas in it mind you the waiter told me it was spicy ... Ha nowhere close!! The barbecue ranch chicken salad was nothing barely there!

Greta K.,"Worcester, MA",210,400,79,4.0,7/18/2013,"Normally, I don't care for too many chains but I look forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory about twice a year. And I have to say they have a nice and often uncrowded brunch on the weekends. I've been many times but my favorite experience was going here in the fall and eating my entire serving of Eggs Benedict (they have huge portions, but I was pregnant at the time).  I recently went on a weeknight at 8:30 and there was not wait (thank goodness). We munched on the bread before our orders were taken and let me say that the dark brown bread is really good. I want to take some home with me every time!  My normal choice is either a salad or a sandwich. The entrees are a little pricey (though again, the portions are quite large). Their salads are really good but I chose some kind of Southwestern/Californian chicken sandwich with avocado on a crusty Italian bread with sweet potato fries. Honestly, this sandwich was pretty good and no, I didn't eat the whole thing and brought half home to my husband.  When cheesecake is on the dessert menu, I don't usually order it except here at it's namesake. I've had several different kinds here- the original with strawberries, the red velvet cake, the tuxedo, the dulce de leche, the chocolate mousse, the brownie, the Godiva, etc. However, I really think they should have a dessert choice that features small slices of a few kinds (maybe three) in addition to a huge slice of just one flavor. Maybe CF could choose their most popular flavors or the customer could choose. I want to try everything and have small plates like tapas everywhere! At this location, I've never had a bad waiter/waitress and the restaurant and bathrooms are always spotless.

The restaurant itself is very large, almost cavernous, with lots of seating and great ambience. I felt like I was in a roman palace! (I was dining by myself, and they still generously offered me a nice large table and seat). However, this place is a tad too popular. The parking is a nightmare. I almost got run over on the way in. Nothing was going to keep me from those delicious smells coming from inside. My waiter was a helpful little guy. I've never seen a waiter so passionate about his menu. He was actually making me a little uncomfortable with his excitement. I started with some delicious appetizers: Roadside Sliders, Avocado Egg-rolls, Fried Mac n Cheese and Crab Cakes. ALL VERY GOOD. I especially want to give a shout out to the Avocado Egg-rolls (I wanted to try more selections). For my entree, I ordered the Steak Diane. Pretty good, but I thought the steak could have been juicer. I should have got the Fillet Mignon... I was feeling pretty full and told the waiter (little devil) that I would probably be skipping desert. He INSISTED on showing the ""desert demo"". A nice way of tempting the customer. How could I resist? So I ate a Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake while I was there. YUM! I also ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I had intended to eat the cakes the next day, but the temptation took over me and I ended up eating one on the way home and one later that night on the couch. I paid for it all night long... trust me. I really wish the waiter had just respected my wishes and not tempted me into buying desert.

I digress.  I typically have no problem snagging a seat at the bar and ordering food.  The bartenders and extremely efficient, friendly, and polite to all customers regardless of whether or not you order booze.  If you want a Diet Coke and order an appetizer, you are treated with the same amount of respect as if you ordered a bottle of wine and a steak dinner.   My personal favorite is the Skinnylicious Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wraps that are served in bib cup lettuce ""bowls"".  It's messy to eat, but the salsa has a significant kick to it (me gusta!) and overall, it's a great meal and plenty for just one person.  And it's under $10 so it's totally reasonable.

I get that people want lots of options but I am hesitant to trust a restaurant that does Tex-Mex and Asian dishes.  After looking over Crime & Punishment (Menu Edition) I realized that I was getting shafted on vegetarian menu options. They didn't even have a veggie burger. Even Chilis have a veggie burger!  I opted to get the grilled cheese sandwich that turned out to be pretty disappointing.

nathan t.,"Waltham, MA",12,7,,4.0,5/14/2011,"First off, I wanted to say that while I've often looked at reviews on yelp, I've never been moved to actually write one.  My girlfriend and I have been around the Boston area for some time, so we've made it a bit of a habit to try a large variety of things in the area.  A lot of great places, and on occasion some mediocre or poor ones.  We elected to take my girlfriends mother here for mother's day after work a week ago (on mothers day, so I was not surprised to see it busy as usual).  It was nice - a nicely decorated place with good food, and comfortable.   The wait was pretty much expected.  Hey, when you go to the Cheesecake factory, you know they are going to be busy, and you deal with it.  Considering the number of other people waiting, I'd say they are quite organized in finding everyone a table as promptly as possible.  I will admit - I often do not trust restaurants with huge menus.  When restaurants try to be everything to everyone, they often do not manage to do a great job on any of them.  Cheesecake has proven me wrong on this.  Whenever I have been to the Cheesecake, I always get something different.  From pasta,, to stteak, to salads, burgers, fish, asian inspired - whatever - you name it.  I have never been dis-satisfied with any of the quality , OR the value of the meal.  (I've been to some supposedly great places, and have felt completely cheated!) Back to the story. This time was no exception. G/f got the same dish as always - Penne(not fettuccine)  with chicken and sundried tomatoes.  Her mother had the chicken Madeira, and I had the orange chicken - don't think it was exactly this, maybe one of the newer dishes that's not listed yet online.     We did order an appetizer of off their new ""specials' menu on the recommendation of our server.  cool.  However, when our food appeared later, sans appetizer, we were a little confused.  Also, they had made the g/f's pasta with the default fettuccine, not penne.  We mentioned this to the server before he even put it down, and he promptly apologized and immediately took the pasta back to the kitchen to change it. We were a little annoyed - but hey - it was busy, and a mistake I can understand how they made.  about 5m later, the manager came over, and profusely apologized for the misunderstanding, and truly tried to make up for the mistakes.  He brought my girlfriend a caeser salad immediately, to help the wait more bearable - certainly not expected, and a very genuine gesture.  I was surprised when their very busy kitchen brought out my g/f's pasta less than 8 minutes later.  I was very impressed how quickly they corrected the problem.  And yes, my girlfriend thought it was delicious and she's known to be exceptionally picky, so they certainly did not half-ass it.  Our original server came back, apologized herself for the miscommunication, and offered us desert on the house to make up for it.  Again - not really expected, and certainly a gesture that we sincerely appreciated that they were truly trying to make things better.  We each got dessert, (I had the pina colada, girlfriend had some peanut butter / chocolate monstrosity, and her mother the key lime cheesecake with mango - all were very good).  So - to sum it up.  Busy.  Food certainly met or exceeded all of our expectations.  Some issues, that were promptly and honestly addressed by the restaurant (which I think they deserve a lot of credit for).  As before, I'll certainly be returning again sometime.  The only reason why I gave a 4, is because I've been to some very amazing places, that the cheesecake simply can't compete with, given the pricepoint and market they are serving.  However, against their peers, I would say they are a top notch and well run organization, for a large scale american chain.  And I've been *extremely* impressed by their continual high quality over time - something that seems to decline rapidly after the first year of a new chain opening, and they try to minimize costs / improve profits once they have solidified a return customer base. Overall - great place to go for lunch or dinner, especially when you're looking for something nice without being pretentious.  Seems to be a pretty fitting choice for many occasions (admittedly maybe not all).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=160

Ann F.,"Franklin, MA",33,17,4,1.0,5/13/2012,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. If they are all as bad as this one, I do not know how they stay in business! I have been here 3 times, each time with a large party(8 people twice, 11 people once). We called and was told they did not take reservations or call ahead seating. Ok, fine. SInce one member of our party was 7 months pregnant and we also had an 18 month old, my husband went ahead to get in line. He was told it was a 90 minute wait, they really didn't have the means to accommodate large parties easily! They had to wait to get three tables together for us. After an hour, when my husband went to check the pager, something was rattling around in it. Thinking it may be broken, he went back to the desk to check. Hewas told it as fine and we had been told 90 minutes and it had only been 70. This was a celebration for my son's college graduation. After another half hour, when we noticed large groups who arrived after us were being called, we checked again. Lo and behold, our pager WAS faulty. Gave us another one and we waited another 15 minutes. Now we have waited over 2 hours and why didn't we leave, you ask? Because it was Saturday night and we had already invested the time. So, on we go to check again...and find out that our table had been given away by accident! The manager kept apologizing and telling us we would be seated in 10 minutes and to pick 4 appetizers for free for as soon as we sat down. We stood in the lobby and waited some more. I see the appetizers come out of the kitchen and we still have not been seated. The appetizers were sent back, but then the manager comes back, with the appetizers while we are standing around waiting and being pushed out of the way by people and says ""why don't you eat these right here while you are waiting?"" At this point, we explode! I have a pregnant woman and toddler who have waited for close to 3 hours and they want us to eat standing up in front of the whole restaurant? The manager was pissed that we refused this. He had also promised a free dessert by way of apology to my graduating son. Well, that never happened either. Overpriced, filthy, horrible customer service, the manager of this particular chain should be ashamed of themselves Because of this store, I will never eat at a Cheesecake Factory ever again. The only bright spot to the evening, was a wonderful server named Stella, who was very attentive. We did tip her of course, but I am a very generous tipper and I am afraid my anger at the manager ended up affecting Stella, which in hindsight, was not fair. But this is what happens. A bad manager affects the whole staff. I will be send ing a copy of this review to corporate. Something has to be done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=160

Parking is a nightmare, and their pagers have anemic reception at best, meaning you have to stay within ears shot anyways. Food is about what you'd expect, decent, but certainly not noteworthy. Tastes like it was prepared in bulk from supplies that came from a distribution center, as I'm sure is the case. It's better than some other chain restaurants (not going to name names) but still unimpressive. Seemed rather expensive for the quality as well, although portions were generous. Last time I visited, a Friday night, the staff at the reception desk were actually talking at (not to) people as if they were cattle; ushering them around and attempting to herd them. Very demeaning.

After years of hearing rave reviews, some from people whose opinion I respect I stumbled into one of these to try some of that highly regarded cheesecake. First off the selection of cheesecake is intimidating. If America is all about choice then Cheesecake Factory fully adheres to that motto. They all look like beautifully sculpted pieces of dessert you will be constantly second guessing yourself as to which one to choose. It's almost unnerving how many flavors there are. We opted to sit down and started off with the Cheesecake Factory merlot. It was fantastic. Great flavor and smooth. I know some places like to only pour 3-4 drops of wine in the glass but here they fill it up a little more than halfway.  I ordered the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake and my girlfriend had this monster of a piece of chocolate peanut-butter greatness. Both were amazing. I wish I could have drafted up a contract and leased my mouth out to that cheesecake for 12 months. The price is a little high for a slice but it's well worth it. Our server was on top of his game. He was courteous and very helpful with the cheesecake selection. I even caught him polishing our wine glasses before they were brought out. Oh and it was super busy in there but we were never neglected in any way.  I did not order any food off the menu.

Rosie D.,"San Francisco, CA",145,50,26,4.0,5/26/2011,"I came to this restaurant on 5/20/2011.  I have been to a variety of cheesecake factory restaurants throughout the country and this one is like any other especially the atmosphere. Our wait time was a bit long, 45 minutes.  But the server made a big difference.  She was fast, prompt and professional.  Our food came out very quickly.  So overall, I am satisfied with this cheese cake factory.  I feel like the experience depends on your server as well as the chef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=140
CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,2.0,1/27/2011,"Now I have gone too 2 other locations. This one makes it my 3rd. I must say Im not very impressed with the staff here... So we walk in one night after a long night of shopping with the girlfriend. We had a 40 minute wait. So great! Not a problem. We enjoy the food here so we wait it out! We got sat and our waiter comes over to take our order. So everything is going great and we order our drinks and an app. As soon as he leaves my girlfriend leans over to me and tells me that he was winking at her and making faces. Kinda strange. In fact I laughed. So then he comes back and takes our order for dinner. He does the same type of thing. Again I laughed. :P So I ordered the Cajun chicken little's. It came with breaded chicken strips with Cajun on them....Wait it did NOT come with any Cajun on them. There for it was either not made right or the Cajun here is just bad. So I went ahead and was eating it anyways. The sad fact is the potatoes was the best part of my meal. So the meal was nothing more than avg for me. The girlfriend got enchilada. She didn't even finish it.  She ended up not feeling to well after our app for some odd reason. For our app we had fried mac and cheese balls. ALL I can say about these are YUMMY! It was sooo good! It came with four good size cheese balls. After breaking it open you cant help but want more! I highly recommend these! Great for 2 people! So after eating we each had food left and asked for them to be boxed. The server came and boxed them up for us. While he put the bag on the table he makes a small little comment...""I added another bag in there in case you guys part ways tonight."" and at that point I had enough.  I ended up paying our bill of $50.00 or so and left nothing for a tip. the food was fairly priced but the chicken lacked in Cajun badly. So I cant help but to think what went wrong here. My guess is if the server put the effort he put into hitting on the girlfriend maybe it would have been better. I am thinking the food wasn't typed in correctly. Even the girlfriend said she couldn't taste anything Cajun. I left hungry and not to happy I must say.  So at the end of the day the food was poor and the server is a jackass. This is the only bad run in I have had with this chain. So I will continue to go. I will however give this location another go in the future and update the score when I do so. Very poor 2/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=140
Molly M.,"Framingham, MA",0,19,,4.0,8/15/2013,"Been here a few times, first time reviewing, never had a bad experience. Recently went for lunch and we were seated by a nice kid and when I asked if we could be seated somewhere else (instead of crammed in between 2 other tables of diners) he said sure! And put us in a booth.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was consistent and good.

Jenn C.,"Marlborough, MA",17,94,5,2.0,4/7/2011,"Meh explains it. Went for lunch with Mom today. Ordered the Pear and Endive salad and asked for it without the nuts (allergic) Mom ordered the Asian Salad. They were huge, I mean enough salad to feed a family of four in almost any other country. The salad's arrived, mine had nuts on the top and Mom;s was covered in way, way too much crunchy noodle things. The waiter that delivered the salads was not the waiter that took our order, I told him of the nut mistake and my allergies and he promptly brought the salad back to the kitchen.  So while we're waiting for a new salad, a manager comes over and apologizes for the misunderstanding, but also worded his apology to include that it may have been my error, he wasn't sure.  Can you say Insulting and Offensive?  The new salad was decent, the greens were fresh and it was huge, but honestly I don't think I'm going to rush back there any time soon.  Luckily I pay attention and I only have a mild allergy, can you imagine if... No need to say more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=200
Rita V.,"Hudson, MA",153,1152,86,2.0,4/27/2011,"I've never really been a fan of this chain for a multitude of reasons, although I really enjoy the CHOCOLATE CAKE!  I normally visit Met Burger or Sel de la Terre for lunch, but given this is one of our Secretary's favorite places, we bit the bullet and went.  Food is not upscale or ""foodie-ish"", it IS a chain restaurant in the ""Unos/Olive Garden"" type of category.  Food is ok, average food, average price and average service.  All the diners at our table were happy with their burgers, and for not being a latin restaurant, the cuban was ok.  They have a very broad and confusing menu, but there is something for almost everybody and a lot of drink selections (although I am also picky with my alcohol, and really, the best bar in the mall IS @ Sel....).  I had asked our server for one simple request, and she forgot it.  Tried to rectify it in the end but by then we were leaving.  Our Host was extremely personable, I wonder why our server seemed so uninterested and aloof.  But we were enjoying each others company, and the food was ok, so thank you Cheesecake for delivering what our special someone really enjoys - her food with her people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=200

Michelle S.,"Fairbanks, AK",30,628,25,4.0,9/27/2011,"I used not really like the food at Cheesecake Factory - just the desserts but they've really started to win me over.  Some time back, I wrote a review for a Cheesecake Factory - in Burlington, I think and my favorite thing then was the Thai lettuce wraps.  I have a new favorite now - the Chicken Bellagio.  It's chicken that is pounded super thin, breaded and then fried - not just one breast, but two (for taking home for leftovers).  The chicken is topped with proscuitto and cheese and then it sits atop angel hair with pesto sauce.  The thing that makes the whole dish is the arugula nest on top of it all.  Love it.  I can't get enough.  I popped the whole second portion in the freezer and when I wanted it, put the chicken breast in the oven, a touch of milk in a pan with the noodles and sauce and meal number two was served.  My partner got the farfalle (bow tie pasta) with roasted garlic, caramelized onions and peas in a parmesan cream sauce.  It was awesome too.  The caramelized onions really make the dish.  The we topped it off with cheesecake.  Since it's not yet October, I couldn't get my favorite pumpkin so decided on something new - the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  It was good but not as good as my favorite pineapple upside down cheesecake.  My partner got something new too - a special Hershey's edition cheesecake.  She said the same, it was good but not as good as her favorite - the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake.   The worst is the wait but since most are at a mall, it's easier to find something to do while waiting.  It's also a pretty noisy place so it's not as a great a place to take older patrons as it's too hard to hear one another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=200

Melissa R.,"Attleboro, MA",6,2,1,5.0,4/26/2012,I have to say that I've eaten at cheesecake factory many times and always been happy. Tonight was exceptional! My daughter ordered the burrito and requested no peppers. Unfortunately it still came with the peppers. Normally we are not the kind if people who say anything but she really couldn't eat it.  We politely told the waiter and he profusely apologized and insisted on getting a new one.  This is what one would normally expect.  What was totally impressive is within 2 minutes the manager came over and also apologized.  Then came more...the manager personally delivered the new plate and said it would not be on our bill.  I've rarely received this level of service even from fancy restaurants.  I just wanted to say how impressed I was and thank you for such great service!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-natick?start=200

The tips (medallions? no) were chewier than they should have been but the accompanying mushrooms, onions and mashed potatoes carried the dish. I could have had a plate of just those sides and been a happy diner.  Also, I don't know Linda but I have eaten her Fudge Cake. If I could I would take that cake into a quiet corner, lay it down on a bed of whipped cream and have my way with it again if I had my chance. It was THAT good.

Their portions are enormous, their desserts (although packing more than 1,500 calories a piece) are delicious, and the atmosphere is whimsical. However, I despise the Natick Collection. The Natick Mall was once a nice place to catch a bite at the food court and do some window shopping. Now it is filled with Euro Trash and over-priced designer crapola that has managed to spill out into the Cheesecake Factory.

There is something for everyone which is great. Whatever you are in the mood for they'll have it. The Tuna Carpaccio appetizer is amazing! It's super thin and tastes great. Their avocado eggrolls are also to die for. The cook their burgers to perfection also! Although it can be pricy at times, it is totally worth it to go out every once in awhile. This place is awesome!!  And of course the cheesecake is fantastic. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. I'm not even a big cheesecake fan and I think it's amazing.
