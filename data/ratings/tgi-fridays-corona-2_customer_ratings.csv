Tonight we were seated right away and the waitress came to take our drink order within a few minutes. My husband loves the Jack Daniels Flat Iron and almost always orders that. He also ordered one of the special milkshakes for the holidays - the XO Cafe one. He liked it!  I ordered the flat iron steak that comes with the maison butter, a baked potato and salad. All were very good and the steak had nice flavor. I usually order the cheddar mashed potatoes which are amazing, but opted for the lower calorie option tonight.  We have had good food and service here and are surprise by the low star rating.  The sangria is very tasty - I get the very berry one!  We will continue to go back to this restaurant.

97,Richard T.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",50,33,1.0,4.0,2012-04-05,"As I had business in the area on consecutive days, I ate here two days in a row. I came away from the experience thinking that I should start a website covering just lunchtime specials.  That being said, I can't be considered a fan of franchise, factory food but there are instances where the whole equals more than the sum of the parts and usually it's because of the service, which can make or break ANY meal. In the case of this particular TGI Fridays, at lunchtime at least, the endless lunch combined with an exceptional, personable server -- in my case Suzy -- combined to make for a very good lunch experience.  For $6.95 how can you beat all the soup and salad you can eat WITH a drink? Your choice of two crisp, fresh salads (Ceasar or house) combined with your choice of five different hot soups, is an unbeatable deal. And this I believe is done corporate-wide at TGI Fridays. Normally I like to frequent individually owned establishments, if for nothing more than variety, and in the case of family-style restaurants, the daily specials that usually offer a great value. And I realize that the experience at chain establishments usually is fair at best. so when a ""food factory"" is hitting on all cylinders, as has been my experience with this TGI Fridays, it comes as something of a surprise. I think that this endless lunch special is an exceptional value, so much more so than Souplantation even though they include a pasta choice without much flavor and desserts, which IMHO, are almost uneatable. But again, it's the service that can make an OK meal very good and in my case, with Suzy at least, the service has been uniformly excellent. It's rare to find a server who knows exactly when to return to the table to check on things, but she comes back when I'm ready for another round.  If you visit this TGI Fridays, ask to be seated in Suzy's section. If you're on the management team at this location, Suzy should be training all of your serving staff.  Food is OK, probably a bit above three stars, but service and value (at lunch) rank five out of five stars, thus the overall rating of four stars out of five.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=180,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

We sat at the bar.   1st we were greated at our table my one of the waiters who starting talking crap to my husband about his tattoos on his arms.  Being that we were in a rush and the guy seemed ""off""...i kept my cool and we just went on, but i wanted to tell the guy to F off. Then i guess he was feeling really comfortable with us (how??) and started to make racist jokes against the black community.  This was WAY inappropriate for this guy to be saying this stuff, but once again...i let it go becuase i didnt want to make a scene.   We ordered some beers and 2 apps. It took 25 mins for the food to come out.  25 mins for some tacos and soup!  we all know that shit is prepackaged, so why so long, especially since the place was empty? While we were waiting for our food, we could have used another beer.  But the oh so awesome ass clown of a waiter was too busy texting and eating vegetation out of the drink mixing station. As soon as the guy brought our food, i asked for the bill, knowing it would take a while. I literally ate two bites out of my 3 ""Korean Style"" tacos and couldnt do anymore.  There were so gross. My god, i have had better out  of their dinners in the frozen section in my local grocery store.  And the soup....bland.  Whatever.  I was getting furious and this point and was going to ask for a manager, but we were already 5 mins late to our movie.

I'm appalled that is the service I have received from a manager.  Plus, this is not the first time I've had an issue with the service at this location.  Several months ago I was dining in ordered the same salad; I asked for the dressing on the side, but when the food was brought to our table it was saturated in dressing.  I alerted our server and she apologized and went to bring me another salad... when I received the ""corrected"" salad.  It was the same chicken on a bed of new lettuce without the additional ingredients that the salad comes with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=180,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.5960000000000005,2.44

New manager now so thought we would give it a try again, hopefully the overcharging has stopped.  Went in, many tables empty. Was told to wait five mins...turned into 15. Never asked our name, just kept pointing to 'those people' waiting for a table. Many open tables, hostesses standing around, scratching their hair, joking with each other. Finally got seated in a table that had been empty the entire time. I personally think the hostess in a restaurant should have ""front house"" appearance, not look like a shower hadn't been had in days. Anyways, food ordered and took quite some time since a huge table was seated right by us.  Although seated after us, only 2 in our party, they were actually served first. When my food came out, the potato had sour cream draped across it in a very sloppy manner just slopped on, no butter or chives, as ordered. Potato was barely cooked, needed a steak knife to cut it...completely inedible. Manager came out...unsolicited...to see if everything was ok, assume he came out because he knew it certainly was NOT ok. Offered a new potato, no money off the bill or anything. At this point we have already waited over 45 mins for our food so no, I just won't eat the undercooked potato. No apology other than we had the misfortune of coming when the kitchen was backed up. REALLY...you are a restaurant and the place is 1/2 empty!   To be honest, this is one of the worst run places I have ever been with no excuses offered for their pitiful service.   And the dirty appearance of the hostess, scratching her head constantly because it appeared so unkempt, will keep any normal person away from this establishment which is a shame, the food at Friday's is better than the Corona establishment leads you to believe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=200,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.6640000000000006,2.76

This was my second attempt at this location and both times it was an EPIC fail. They are extremely slow so make sure you give yourself enough time and don't show up when you are hungry. There was no Hostess available to greet us when we walked in, so we waited about 5 minutes as several workers walked right by us without acknowledging the fact that we had not been seated. Finally someone said hello and said he would get us a table right away. That didn't happen. He proceeded to write down all other parties on the waiting list. As soon as tables were available, he went down his list with 3 parties before I had to speak up at the fact that he skipped us.  When we were finally seated, we ordered fairly quick. Too bad that was the only quick thing that happened all night. Our food took almost 40 minutes to come out of the kitchen. I ordered the ribeye steak and baked potato with veggies. It all tasted a day old but I was just so tired that I did't complain. I just wanted to eat and get out of there. That is exactly what I did and I don't plan to return. Before picking up the check our waitress asked us if we wanted waters to go? Who does that?  Overall it was just a sucky experience. I'm not sure that I'll go back to TGIFridays again.

It then seemed as though it was all down hill from there. The food was sub par and the service was not great, and there was no one in the restaurant at the time. I ordered the Parmesan encrusted flounder and it came out soggy, almost like a TV dinner, with the wrong sides. Once again getting anyone to come back to the table was as if this place was actually busy. My sons dinner also didn't  come with the condiments he ordered.

It's TGIF, it's moderately loud, the bar area is packed and social with people laughing and watching tv and everyone appears happy and upbeat.   Friday night, the food was perfect and our drinks could have been better. We did return one drink to the bar for something different due to overall quality. Our server was another story. In his defense, he did say that he was new. It took more than 10 minutes to order for 4 people. He had a very hard time hearing our order and was unfamiliar with the menu. As we were bidding farewell to my niece and new husband, we celebrated by ordering a round of drinks and requested a shot as a side. Our shots were added into our drinks before arriving at the table. Admittedly, I am a little picky about this. I felt that the shots should have been separate as you are billed separate. To correct this, he offered to do it next time. There wasn't a next time. They're flight back to Guam was leaving at 4am from LAX and it was very late already. Sunday my daughters and I went after shopping. It was quieter but still a great atmosphere. Great server.

The only reason why I'm leaving a review is because the food was not good. We've gone to other TGIs and the food was good but we were disappointed with the food here. I ordered a medium rare New York steak with shrimp and you could barely cut through the steak. It tasted like steak that was pre-cooked or boiled put away and then cooked again. I felt like I was eating microwaved leftovers. The shrimp looked like it was just reheated. They got my wife's sides wrong and promptly replaced them but did not even clean the plate.  My daughter's food was good and the dessert at the end saved the day. But I wish I could say I enjoyed my steak branded by NBA Spalding. If there was an ability to put a sad or crying emoji I would. It was steak you should be allowed to cry over steak right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=40,2.56,2.93,2.93,2.3760000000000003,2.782

She greeted us she was nice..but no apologies. Got our drinks quickly.  Then Took awhile to take our order.  We watched the male manager (blue long sleeve shirt) talk to a bartender while she was eating out of a togo container then watched our server help herself to some of this same food as well while she was at the cash register. Crew should be eating in back not in front of guests. No washing of the hands.  Genevieve our server was just too busy. It was obvious she had too many tables.  This poor service was more the managers fault then this server.  Food came burgers tasted ok but way overcooked.  Not a good experience.

3,Skyler S.,"Corona, CA",121,41,9.0,3.0,2017-03-29,"I'm giving 3 stars only because our server was attentive and great.  I had came here to meet up with an old co worker and his fiancé with my fiancé as well. We thought it would be cool since we had been seeing the $10 unlimited appetizers deal on commercial basically every day. So we decided to come check it out because it was a great deal.  Our wait was 20-25 minutes so I decided to grab a couple drinks from the bar before we got seated. Anyways it took about 15 just for the bartender Allyson to acknowledge us. Now at least SHE did acknowledged us because several of the other bartenders behind the bar didn't even notice we were there. The reason for the 3 stars is because not only did it take 15 minutes for us to even get a drink order in, but after that I waited for another 15 minutes just for the raspberry basil margarita as well as a mojito. Why does it take 15 minutes just to get a drink order placed & another 15 to get our drinks.  Meanwhile of course we had gotten sat, so my fiancé went to our table while I waited at the bar for our 2 drinks still. I couldn't believe I wasn't able to get a drink before we got sat with an estimated seating time of 25 mins max. I honestly would have been better off waiting to get drinks until we got sat because at that point it she was sitting alone & I was waiting at the bar alone.  The appetizers were okay, the wings i'd say is the best thing to get out of all of them, since we ended up trying everything. The wings are definitely the best bang for your buck. The potato skins were okay, and just because i felt like there was too much potato VS cheese/bacon bites. Sauce with them is a must. Overall pretty mediocre service & okay food. But I guess that is what you get for $10 unlimited appetizers, obviously didn't expect the BEST appetizers. The raspberry basil margarita was great tasting though to end on a more positive note!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20,2.88,2.95,2.95,2.412,2.9219999999999997

I placed my order an hour before I was going to pick up which as at 11am and let them know I'd be there at noon. I get there 3 minutes after 12pm and my order was not ready. Mind you there was barely anyone there so they weren't busy at all. Then the lady at the front had to look for someone to run my card and it took forever!  She went to the back to get my food and that took a while only to come back and my payment was still not processed. After all this i only had about 15 minutes left to even eat my lunch by the time I got back to my office because they took so long even though I told them I'd be there at noon and they had an hour to have my order ready. It was ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20,2.6,2.76,2.76,,2.696
75,Mathew T.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-17,"If I could give a minus 5 Stars I would for the TGI Fridays in Corona. The manager Juan Martinez is terrible and a liar. My family with a party of ten ate lunch at the Fridays in Corona on 09-17-2017 at the conclusion of the meal my sister attempted to pay for the $200 bill with her credit card, Juan Martinez came to our table and stated that her card was denied, I gave him my credit card and he also returned stating that my card was denied, I gave him a third card and he also returned saying that that card also was denied. I ask Juan to double check at another terminal to see if it was his machine, Juan said that all the machines are the same. I told him that it's no way that three credit cards that are from three different banks could get denied. Juan ""Shrugged"" his shoulders and said we had to pay in cash. While talking to Juan my sister checked her balance on her card and she had plenty money on the card plus more. I knew both my cards had enough money on them to cover the bill, and after exiting Fridays I call both credit card company's and they concurred. Juan Martinez who's the manager ""lied"" about all three cards and purposely attempted to embarrass me and my family. I will write the VP of Fridays and request the termination of Juan Martinez! Terrible,Terrible service! Also I'm telling everyone I know in the Corona area not to patronize Fridays as long as Juan Martinez is the Manager!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=60,2.44,2.76,2.76,,2.632
2,Davy G.,"San Bernardino, CA",31,2,,1.0,2017-09-17,"I gotta say we've been to a couple of TGIF's and this one has always disappointed . First time our waiter was rude too our son and just had a bad attitude in general. We had only gotten our drinks so we paid for our drinks and canecelled the food and left. Second time around we didn't want to drive to riverside location so came back here. Again another waiter was just giving us the stink eye and the place was a ghost town. We ordered some drink s again, my beer was good but my wife's drink tasted funky, we took a closer look and the drink was filled with PAPER! We brought up to their attention and they took care of the charge for that drink. We are never going back there again save your gas and go to the riverside location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20,2.32,2.76,2.76,,2.584
7,Jay P.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,2.0,1.0,2017-09-23,We wanted to take our son out to dinner and a movie for doing well on tests in school. Our movie was at 8:40. We arrived at Friday's around 7:00pm and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. 40 minutes later we were seated. After being seated at 7:40 we waited 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. At 8:00pm a server came and took our drink order . We asked if we could order everything because we were seeing a movie at 8:40. She took our order but we didn't see her for another 20 minutes. At 8:20 I had to stop her and ask if we could at least get my sons drink (he ordered a slushy). She said it was at the bar and she would get it shortly. She then brought me my iced tea and 5 min later brought my son a melted slushy . At 8:35 we decided we had to leave . We hadn't received our appetizer or soups yet and we knew we wouldn't be able to eat and watch the movie . The server told us not to leave because our food was sitting on the slide. She then brought a bunch of food over none of which was ours . Turns out it was the table next to us who arrived a good 20-30 minutes after we had been seated. They ruined our night out and didn't even offer an apology. They made us pay for our drinks before we left. Horrible service . Would not recommend .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20,2.32,2.75,2.75,,2.5780000000000003

( Husband and I were having to talk pretty loud to hear one another) -Menus are beat to hell, ripped,really dirty, pages falling out. Just all bad. -Happy hour drinks smallest amount of alcohol and watered down. -Portions are a lot smaller than other TGIF I've been too  For being in a busy spot in Dos Lagos  I would've thought it be a better experience, the waitress was nice and attentive though, didn't catch her name but she had a noticeable accent.

122,Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,3.0,2017-11-09,"Dropped by to check out the 2 meats and sides promo.  Ordered the sirloin and crusted chicken breast...both of which were very good. Mashed potatoes and onion rings were also pretty good.   Also had a FAB bloody Mary....perhaps the best I have ever had.....but at $9.50 it is grossly over priced.  It SHOULD be a nice $5 Happy Hour special like it is at the nearby Chili's.....And, as you may recall, last football season they had UNLIMITED Bloody Marys for only $10 from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Sundays...... Upon checking out, I asked for a toothpick, as I saw none on the hostess stand.  I was told by the hostess, that they had them only for the first few days she worked there and then they ran out and no one bothered to re-order them.  This is an ongoing issue at this location.  WHY?  Doesn't management realize that when you are serving yummy BBQ ribs, EVERYONE needs a toothpick unless they want to run around all day with annoying and ugly  slivers of meat between their teeth.  I had to walk across the street to Wood Ranch to get one.....What is wrong with this picture??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2,2.48,2.77,2.77,,2.654
5,Rebecca J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-19,From the start the experience was bad. Server said he was either training or had someone he was training but that he couldn't remember her name but that we would meet her. We never met her.... and he only came to the table twice.  The food was horrible! My steak was over cooked. Server basically told me what sides I was getting instead of asking me which sides I would like. I had to tell him no and what I actually wanted. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were reheated and came from a bag and the broccoli was mushy. My whole plate of food was soaking in butter and oil. My husband got the fried shrimp dinner and it was a portion of a kids meal for $18.00 fries were rubbery and cold and the shrimp was way over cooked tasted like you were eating rubber bands. The server never gave us refills  on our waters and I asked for lemon and never got it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20,2.48,2.76,2.76,,2.648

137,Tiffani L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,31,,1.0,2017-12-09,I haven't been on yelp in months but logged back on just to write about how TERRIBLE of a time we had here! We waited almost 30 mins at our table without anyone checking on us before my husband went and asked the manager if we could at least get some drinks started. Drinks came and they forgot mine. Our waiter came and was pushing gifts cards on us. When they brought my drink it wasn't the right one. I asked for the right one and got charged for it. It took a very long time before our food arrived. My food came first and we didn't have any silverware. It took about 10 minutes before I got a fork so of course my food was cold now. They didn't even bring my husband silverware. They got his order wrong so his food took even longer. Even after his food finally came he still had to wait for silverware. We didn't get to eat dinner together and neither of us even finished because we were so frustrated. I am a very patient person and totally understanding when a business is busy because I used to work in a restaurant but this was ridiculous! We spent about 2 hours there! We don't go out often because we have young kids so this was extremely disappointing. Especially since we wasted $70 on all this!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2,2.16,2.64,2.64,,2.4480000000000004

Started off great, sat in the bar, was greeted instantly, waitress even sold us on signing up for the rewards club. Appetizer and drinks came fast and were really good. Burgers came right after, and where our experience took its turn for the worst. Our waitress checked in right when we got our food, and it was last we saw of her. The burgers were good quality, but just bland, no seasoning on the patty, and couldn't taste any sauce or cheese. The fries were the opposite, they over salted them and left us begging for another drink. We sat for almost 30 min, waiting for our waitress for another drink, finally gave up and decided to just pay our bill without even finishing our meal, on the kiosk they have on the tables. We always get receipts but of course the printer was broken. We kept waiting because after spending that much money on a burger, there was no way we were going to waste it. After another 10 min we spotted our waitress and other staff just standing over by the bar. My husband had to get up and go over to ask them for a box. They were nice and offered us free stuff for making us wait and such, but after that much time we just wanted to leave. To top it all off, the box they gave us was used, and had BBQ sauce smudged inside, so we had to go back and ask for another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2,2.0,2.47,2.47,,2.2820000000000005
123,D J.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,18,37.0,2.0,2018-01-05,Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in a very long time. This place was very much a waste of a friday night out. I am still not sure why I went against my better judgement. We waited a little longer than usual to head out for dinner and most places were packed. Figuring this place would seat us sooner we gave our annual visit. Boy was I wrong it took an hour to get our food and everything was dead cold not to mention there was some sort of error with the description of my meal that I didn't want to waste the time getting into.
