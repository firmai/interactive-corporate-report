68,Matt R.,"Kent, WA",7,7,,4.0,2012-05-11,"Lindsey was our waitress. She was better than the average waiter, and I would hope to get her again next time we come there. The new salted caramel milkshake was slightly over-salted for my taste, but otherwise tasted good. My wife loved it. As usual, some of the fries were hot and crisp, some were luke-warm and soft (which I do not like). The chicken burger we ordered was okay; it was basically a huge chicken breast with a tiny bun and condiments, so the chicken was a little out of proportion. Overall, good service and atmosphere. We will go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=60,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

My salad was terrific.  I tried the harvest chicken salad for the first time.  No complaints at all.  However, the bread served along with it was literally so hard I couldn't bite into it.  It's not normal for your food the clang against your plate louder than your utensils. To top things off, our waitress took over 25 minutes to retrieve our payment after leaving our bill.  She wasn't very attentive through out most of this visit and we noticed her giggling and gossiping with the cute Ken Doll guy in the kitchen area.  I wish I could remember her name. Hopefully our next visit will improve upon this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=40,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

We were not offered more fries for the ""bottomless"" fries.

61,Pat M.,"Kent, WA",0,54,1.0,4.0,2013-08-10,"My spouse and I meet for dinner here fairly often since the location is convenient for us both between work and home. We think the Covington Robin experience has become a little on the hit-or-miss side.  When it first opened, the food and service seemed very uniform and we often would see the manager in the front of the house checking in with the diners to be sure everything was good.  Now we sometimes encounter mistakes with the food, the staff seems less attentive, and I haven't seen a manager walking the floor in a really long time. Having said that, they still (usually) make good burgers, decent drinks, and good non-burger alternatives, and the prices aren't bad for a full service establishment.  The all-you-can eat fries that come with the burgers are a good thing when you are feeling famished, and if you visit regularly, you'll be well-treated by their loyalty card and the discounts it brings. Get a big booth in the bar and you won't have to hear the ear-splitting kids that always seem to flock to Red Robin.  In closing, here's some Red Robin trivia: ""The original Red Robin stood at the corner of Furhman and Eastlake Avenues E. in Seattle, at the southern end of the University Bridge. This building dates from 1940 and was first called Sam's Tavern. The owner, Sam, sang in a barber shop quartet and could frequently be heard singing the song ""When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)"". He liked the song so much that he eventually changed the name to Sam's Red Robin.  In 1969, local Seattle restaurant entrepreneur Gerry Kingen bought the restaurant and expanded it. The business dropped the ""Sam's"" and simply became Red Robin.""   -(courtesy of Wikipedia)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=60,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

Jenann and most of the ladies and gentlemen working at the bar are super friendly and helpful.  We've never had a bad drink here (a bad drink....is there such a thing??), and for that matter, I'm hard pressed to think of a really bad meal either. We used to get burgers (hit or miss, depending on the cooks, I suppose), but we've recently been getting more of the deep fried items.  The shrimp and clucks really hit the spot, especially since you can get buffalo clucks.  This dish has become our ""go-to"" menu item, along with the jalapeno coins Soooo good, but I'm sure, soooo bad for my thighs too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

The first batch of sweet potato fries came out burned to a crisp...I asked for another batch that was served their vibrant color and perfect texture. My burger was cooked to perfection, had a very nice ""caprese esque"" flavor, and the steamed broccoli was refreshing to have to lighten up the heavy burger. Our guest had the usual Whiskey River BBQ burger that lived up to all her yummy expectations. She said the fried onions were cooked to a perfect crisp. Our son was very happy with his spaghetti order from the kids menu.  Hubster changed it up and ordered the seafood mix platter with fries rather than his usual WRBBQ burger...it didn't pack the flavor and texture punch that the burger usually does, so he won't be doing that again. Service was awesome. I would have given them 5 stars if they didn't send out a burned batch of sweet potato fries...anyone who looked at that basket would have clearly seen that there was no trace of orange color to be found...horribly burned.

DUMB) that was a tiny portion for the price, a whiskey river BBQ wrap that was sloppy and underwhelming, kids' meatball dinner that seemed like it had been microwaved... It goes on and on.

When I told the manager this was a colossally bad idea, he just basically said -thank you for that feedback--- Basically wrote me off as not important. I had to ask for hot fries a second time and yes, when I got home, my meal was ice cold.

2,Andy P.,"Seattle, WA",1,43,,4.0,2017-10-22,"I'm not a big fan of chain hamburger places (except 5 Guys).  Red Robin tends to offer ""gourmet"" burgers that are difficult to eat.  They're also a little pricey.  Having said that, I was favorably impressed by this location.  We've now moved to Maple Valley, so this is ""local"" for us. The occasion was a fund-raiser for the PTA at the school where our daughter works (let's hear it for community involvement by local businesses).  A big ""Plus"" for RR is that they are very responsive to food allergy issues (our grand-daughter has severe peanut and egg allergies). Everything went as expected.  The kids' menu was nutritious and offered good choices (our grandchildren are ages 2 and 5). My wife and I ordered the ""Keep it Simple"" -- or something like that, burger.  It was very good, and I enjoyed it.  The price was under $10.  It includes the choice of some pretty good steak fries or a fruit salad. For a beverage, I ordered a ""Guiness"".  That was a mistake.  I asked the server what temperature the Guiness would be.  She didn't know.  Temperature is very important with Guiness, or any other serious stout beer.  I ordered one, anyway.  Expecting a draft beer, I instead received a can of ""Guiness Draft"".  Some Irish person should be very ashamed, as this wasn't really a Guiness.  The flavor was very weak.  I dunno if it was related to post-brewing storage, or just being canned beer, but it wasn't real Guiness. In the way of background, I'm not a beer snob.  Most of the beer that I drink at home is ""lawn-mowing beer"" -- whatever is cheapest at the store -- think Busch or Milwaukee's Best.  Typically, all I want is something that is cool and refreshing.  I order better beer when away from home, and keep a stock of good beer in the refrigerator, for company, and my occasional indulgence.  My advice to anyone who appreciates good beer is to order something other than Guiness here.  It was a big disappointment. We were pleased to note that my grand-daughter's allergies were listed on the meal ticket.  RR also has a pretty decent frequent eater program.  I gave them my daughter's number, as they eat here more frequently than we do.  I canceled our account when RR insisted on spamming me nearly every day.  They refused to stop spamming me while I had an account with them.  Clearly, they have a much higher opinion of their e-mails than I do. The solution was simple for me.  BTW, the proprietary spice jar that they offer as an inducement to sign up -- it's not very good.  It ended up in my garbage can. RR isn't my first choice for dining.  However, I do very much appreciate the chain's sensitivity to food allergy issues.  I know that we'll be dining here in the future, because there are few restaurants where our daughter and son-in-law are comfortable taking our grand-daughter to dine.  There certainly are much worse places to eat -- the King County Health Service provides guidance in that area. Food inspection results are very important to me.  I generally refuse to eat at restaurants that aren't worried about poisoning their customers.  I'm very happy to report that this location has an enviable record.  Other than an issue in 2016 about cold holding temperatures, they've an excellent record of concern about our health.  Thank you, Covington Red Robin's manager.  I appreciate restaurant managers that are actually worried about not poisoning me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
1,Bradley D.,"Seattle, WA",7,131,75.0,5.0,2017-11-09,"I am baffled by so many of these negative reviews but I'm noticing a trend. The VAST majority seem focused on the orders that are for pick up, which tonight we didn't do. We walked in around 7 pm and were able to find a a larger corner booth for four people! It was even a Seahawks game and the bar was busy! We sat in an area where a young woman named Kiera (red hair, glasses, from Illinois, three kids!) was serving us. She was super bubbly and very cheerful! She was so so so kind and came right over! We knew we wanted milkshakes, a beer and a prickly pear lemonade! (Those lemonades are so delicious!)  After we got drinks, waters and she was back to take our order. Even with how busy it was we got our in 20 minutes! It was stunning. The buns were perfectly crisped, and I'm sorry but the fries were HOT! I even asked for the plate of sauce selections and she giggled because I seriously LOVE Red Robin sauces! Between the four different burgers we ordered we were so impressed. On a super busy Seahawks game night, it only took 1 hour and 16 minutes from start, to us paying to get out and feel completely satisfied! My mother was so impressed, at the close of our meal we got a chance to chat with Kiera! She lives in Enumclaw and seriously LOVES Washington! I was so impressed with how she connected, smiled every time she came to our table, was able to handle all of her tables and really make tonight's experience something to remember! WE WILL BE BACK! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK RED ROBIN COVINGTON!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
3,Krissm A.,"Federal Way, WA",128,317,1903.0,3.0,2017-11-17,Came here fo a birthday but it was too busy. The server was great. She didn't introduce herself but was quick and responsive. She was working her butt off to take care of us. The whisky burger was yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
0,Dign G.,"Seattle, WA",132,28,232.0,5.0,2017-12-19,Not sure why this place has such low ratings! Came here after realizing that our group of 14 people would have to wait an hour at the location near the outlet collection. They took our reservation while we were in Auburn and said itd be about a 10-15 min wait. When we got there we werent seated right away but we didn't have to wait for long.  The waitress was so lovely! She'd make jokes and was very patient when people would change their order last minute. Her jokes weren't lame or the type that make you feel kinda awkward like at some other restaurants.  I guess the food did take a while to come but that's reasonable considering we had 14 people. It also didn't feel too long since we had one another to talk to.  Food was good but didn't expect that taco tavern to be that small seeing how big it looked in the menu. It was actually pretty filling though. My boyfriend and I shared it & it came with bottomless fries. Waitress was very nice about refilling our tables refillable drinks and bottomless fries. Sometimes other red Robin locations make you feel like you shouldn't ask (?)  It was a nice experience & was a friendly atmosphere overall. They also gave free desserts to the three people in the group that we're celebrating their birthdays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
