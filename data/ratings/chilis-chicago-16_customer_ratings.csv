I go here mainly because it's the closest place I can grab a drink and quick food right after work. Monday through Thursday margaritas are only $3.99 (blackberry is my favorite). My coworker and I love to go on Monday for the fajita special. We also love the nachos and the paradise dessert (a blondie with ice cream soooo tasty!). The regular servers I've had are always very accommodating and try their best to serve quickly, although I think the issue with slow service here may have something to do with back of the house and overall understaffing. They are always pretty full no matter what night it is. I've never had a terrible experience here, and clearly I keep going back.

Came here on a starving night with a group of friends an hour before closing. The place was basically empty with 3 other customers & I guess they didnt want to make fresh food since they were obviously prepping to close the place so they could go home.  I was given warm mashed potatoes which looked like they had been scrapped from the bottom of a pan tht Im pretty sure had been sitting there for some hours due to their slow traffic. The least they couldve done was warm up the food to give me the impression that it had just been taken out.  My tostado nachos were definitely not how they were pictured on the menu. Idk wat the hell they gave me.. Looked more like burnt chips slapped with some grounded beef. Where was the other half of the tortilla? They even forgot the peppers that was suppose to go on top. Asked the waitress to take it back. Definitely wasnt gonna pay for the crap they thought I was gonna eat!! I get it, you guys were ready to leave and didnt feel like making anything.

30,Jaimi W.,"Chicago, IL",1,19,7.0,2.0,2014-12-14,"Looking for an explanation for last night's disappointment, I was going to assume it was because we ordered to go, but now I'm not so sure.  The drive was not far at all, and we arrived a few minutes before the time given when I placed the order.  Almost immediately when we walked in they were bringing the bag with our food. To start, we got their classic nachos.  The condiments were in neat little containers, all accounted for, but the nachos themselves were stacked overlapping a great deal, leaving basically a soggy sheet of very cheesy beans :-(.  For my entree, I got the ""crispy"" honey chipotle chicken crispers.  The chicken wasn't as bad as the nachos, but it definately tasted like it had sat closed in the box too long, as most of the crunch was gone.  The part that really irritated me, however, was my husband's entree.  He ordered the southern smokehouse burger, which is supposed to come as follows (I copy pasted this right off their website) ""Topped with 4 slices of applewood smoked bacon, melted sharp cheddar cheese, NEW house-made garlic dill pickles, NEW spiced panko onion rings, fresh leaf lettuce, tomato & NEW Chili's Signature sauce. Served with a side of Chili's classic BBQ sauce"".  He got a few bites in, then opened the whole thing up to find an absolutely dry, sauce less bun, no pickle, no lettuce, and no tomato.  The side of sauce was nowhere to be found in the container as well.  Now I realize this is a chain restaurant, but I at least expect the food I order to come with all the ingredients listed that I paid for, rather than having to dig through my fridge to find substitutes.   Perhaps dinning in will result in a better experience, but I think it's going to be a long while before we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16?start=20,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

24,Ian R.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,,1.0,2015-09-28,"Okay, let me start by saying I'm basing this review off MULTIPLE visits, possibly 5 or 6, so I'm just gonna talk about the 3 visits that stood out the most for all the wrong reasons. ""Why have you gone to a 1 star establishment so many times?!"" you might ask....well, 1) I used to work in food services so I understand an establishment can have an off-night thats not representative of the norm, and 2) I live in the area and believe in supporting local businesses for whatever it's worth (and saving gas). One Sunday afternoon, myself, my wife and my son decided to grab a bite to eat there, walk in and waited a good 15 minutes to be greeted then seated. And I swear we were three of only 9 other patrons in the whole joint!! The menus were filthy- had some sort of tomato based product smeared all over it's pages and the table surface itself didn't feel to clean either. The food was more or less prompt and what I've come to expect from Chili's but my wife had to ask several times for an extra cup of avacado ranch dressing. Then when she had her meal boxed up to go, she had to ask repeatedly for a small container to take some of the dressing home. They act like it's liquid gold or something! The waitress was nice when we were able to get a hold of her, she kept zipping past our table not even looking at us when we needed her most, but maybe they're understaffed... The second time, I stopped at the bar with some friends after a funeral to drown our sorrow and the cocktail glass I drank from had a distinct mildew-y odor when I lifted it to my mug. I couldn't even finish it or make a timely request for another one since the bartender seemed to be more interested in flirting with some ladies on the other side of the bar. Get in where you can fit in, homie, I'm no hater, but I assume you're here cause you're getting PAID to work. I was so tempted to just walk out without paying a cent. The third time, I ordered pick-up from their website, went to pick it up at the designated time, and of course it wasn't ready. They looked at me like I was crazy even when I showed them the confirmation of my order on my iphone and said ""Our internet down!"" but said it as if it was common knowledge and I was the dummy who wasn't paying attention! No apology, no free desert or side, just a 45 minute wait for a simple order that they STILL got wrong!

8,Tamara J.,"Evanston, IL",82,116,397.0,2.0,2017-02-05,"Nothing was terrible about my experience at this Chilli's, but nothing was really good either. Although we were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant, it was over 10 minutes before anyone came over to ask if we even wanted some water. I had to flag down the person who originally greeted us and he found our waitress. While she wasn't unkind, she also wasn't overly friendly. When it was finally time for us to order, I was surprised that she didn't need to write anything down and actually got our order correct. Prices were standard. The food and service were mediocre. The bathrooms were terrible...no tissue in the first stall I entered and the restroom was messy. Won't likely return to this Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
1,Tiffany V.,"Chicago, IL",992,113,594.0,1.0,2017-02-13,"I have been to many Chili's restaurants but this one here is by far the WORST. For starters, the reviews posted about this place are pretty accurate. Nothing good about the service or food. Our party was a group of six. Not one of our orders came out complete. We had to constantly remind our waiter of missed items. Apart of reminding our waiter, it was dissapointing that we had to constantly look for him. The food was another story. Very bland with no flavor whatsoever.  I ordered one of my favorites of Chili's which is the Cajun chicken pasta.  The dish was HORRIBLE. The noodles were well over cooked. No taste of any cajun spices at all and very soggy. I requested a side of cajun spices to add some sort of flavor to 2 of our dishes and it did not help.  We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer.  I asked the waiter twice if they had the dish because after 15minutes of waiting, and already asking once, well, l was confused.  When the appetizer came to our table,  it was like dipping into a bowl of salt. So, were the other dishes lacked flavor or seasoning, this one had it to an extreme. I will not return, Not even if I'm in the area,  hungry and no other place is open. I would rather eat at home. I really hope that this location can get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003

12,Jamaree T.,"Chicago, IL",1,1,,2.0,2017-03-21,This place is terrible! Very unprofessional & bad service. My family & I received cold food after waiting forever!

2,Rashonda H.,"Chicago, IL",90,167,1033.0,3.0,2017-03-28,So after my second visit to this location I'm ready to post a review. This place is up and coming new staff and a new management team. The service was much better the second time around. Our food was really good hot and fresh. And I had the asparagus for the second time and it was very good steamed. Now that I live in the area I will not mind coming on a early afternoon and check out the lunch specials.. Now just keep in mind that the service is getting much better and the menu changes every 3 months. Cool. And one more thing the parking can be a lil tight.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Finally, it was time for this delicious cookie. We told our waitress to ghe order in. And sadly, she returned and told us unfortunately we ade out of cookies. My girlfriend stress the fact that we came in for the cookie and how long our mouths been watering for this cookie. The waitress apologized for the inconvenience and told her manger about our situation. He then came out, apologized for the inconvenience and complimented us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

3,Rocky E.,"Riverdale, IL",73,3,4.0,1.0,2017-11-08,This location is disgusting and the manager Courtney is RUDE! I placed an order online for pick up when I got there it wasnt even ready. It was the lunch special chicken tacos it comes win fries and a side salad or soup. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup it was all broth and I noticed neither of my dishes had fries so I had to go back. They forgot the sour cream and when we opened the boxes the chicken was raw and all fat. I called and they put me on hold for 10 minutes. I called back and he told me to call him back later because he was busy. LOL IS THAT A JOKE!! no I have a meeting in 10 minutes and I can't come back so just give me a refund. He said I have to bring the food back to show him proof. Lol you were the one that packaged it you already know soooo let's not be crazy here. NEVER ORDERING HERE AGAIN,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chicago-16,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
