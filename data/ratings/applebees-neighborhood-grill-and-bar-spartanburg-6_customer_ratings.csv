19,Nick R.,"Tremont, Cleveland, OH",30,94,108.0,2.0,2012-01-13,"Let's discuss the pros and cons of eating out in Spartanburg, and which way you put a bizarre Applebee's on the sleepy side of town. Pros: + The portions at this Applebee's seem pretty darn massive for the price.  The quesadilla that was about $9, seems to have two layers of itself, both of which are loaded with tons of cheese.   Cons: - Why are there still ash trays with used cigarettes on the bar?  Smoking is banned in this county. - The chicken in the quesadillas isn't very good despite all the cheese. - What's with the service here.  Most of the waiters and waitresses seem like you're interrupting their time together. - Why is it so hard to get seated here?  Shouldn't the hostess be around? - The layout of this place is kind of bizarre, the booths are really open to the bar. Overall, there's not a lot worth eating in the area, but this is still worth avoiding in this area.  More options seem to be opening down the street, like a Buffalo Wild Wings.  If it's between this and FATZ though, it might be a tough call.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
20,Harold J.,"Roebuck, SC",0,25,16.0,1.0,2014-02-02,Sorry service and disgusting food. I ordered the Creamy Parmesan Chicken. That is short for slop. The chicken was dry.  There wasn't enough Parmesan sauce to fill a tablespoon. The cheese was cold and hard.  The rice was minus the onion and mushrooms. There was two tablespoons of spinach cooked to mush. The server never came back to the table.  I only got one glass of tea and all I could eat was the rubbery chicken.  I left hungry and had to stop and buy something else to eat.   I noticed others in the restaurant only ate the chicken like I did.  They also looked very dissatisfied.  We had to endure smokers while we were there.   Wont be back.  Eat at Bubba's instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6?start=20,,,,,

14,Jacqueline H.,"Greenville, SC",67,105,318.0,3.0,2015-05-16,Typical franchise food experience. Nothing spectacular. Food ok and service ok.

16,William G.,"Minneapolis, MN",14,234,16.0,3.0,2015-11-21,"Why write a review of Applebee's? I doubt anyone has ever gone to Yelp and said ""hey  I just found this great new place called Applebee's on Yelp."" In fact, I expect most Yelpers hold chains like Applebee's in disdain and I doubt many will read this review, but over a fairly short span of time recently, I have dined at Applebee's in Dickinson, North Dakota, Cloquet, Minnesota, and most recently Spartanburg, South Carolina. In no case has Applebee's been my real choice but was selected more or less for the sake of convenience. I was in Spartanburg on business and looking for a place to eat on Sunday night, I found that my first two choices from Yelp were closed but the Applebee's across the street was open. I was tired and hungry so I ended up eating there and you know what?  It is pretty good. This got me thinking about a review of my recent experiences. I had essentially the same thing each time, the sirloin cooked rare. I usually don't order a steak at an upscale restaurant because it is so hard to screw up and I want to see what the chef can do on something more complex. However, since a steak is so hard to do badly, I usually order it if I have concerns about the ability of the kitchen to deliver on something more difficult. All Applebee's appear to be identical in terms of the menu and the internal layout. No local variations. This certainly promotes uniformity which is what you want in a chain. In two of the three meals, I started with the tortilla soup. This is actually very good. In the third case I had the French Onion soup which was less successful but good French onion soup is hard to get right. In all cases I had the sirloin rare. It was cooked to my satisfaction - red and cool in the center. The meat was flavorful but a bit chewy but sirloin is a chewy cut. No desert. Service was good and servers friendly. I like the idea of offering low calorie options on main courses. Applebee's would never be a ""destination restaurant"" for me. On the other hand I would not hesitate to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
15,Angie G.,"Inman, SC",3,65,18.0,3.0,2015-12-05,"And let me say 3 stars is pushing it! There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and once we were seated, I completely understood! A young couple had 2 irritating children that they could not control dining just a few tables from us. The lady would stand & play these loud games with about a 2 year old to entertain him. I'm sorry but management should've intervened & asked her to sit & shut up! We should've left, but didn't. The service was good, but food was awful. It was the toughest steak my husband has ever had. He actually tried to chew a bite, couldn't & spit it into a napkin! Chicken tenders tasted like they came straight from a freezer & fries were cold. Sorry, but we are done here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
4,Tony R.,"Forest City, NC",71,419,580.0,2.0,2016-01-29,"Let me start by saying that I am an ex-smoker. Didn't realize they still allowed smoking in restaurants. We're starving so I'm putting up with it this once, but please hurry, it's not pleasant. Started with a Yuengling . Kind of on the warm side. We're ordering the two for $25, two side salads, one half rack ribs with fries and one Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp.  The salads are nice, fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, croutons, cheese . Good flavor. Meals are ok, on the small side. I guess you get what you pay for.  Because of the cigarette smoke causing our sinuses to act up, we won't be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
22,B F.,"Decatur, GA",0,10,4.0,1.0,2016-03-07,"Ordered a sirloin steak on a late Friday evening while driving back with the wife from Winston-Salem on February 12, 2016. The steak was unacceptable with a huge piece of fat in the center of the steak about the size of lemon with a big side of gristle and cooked rare not medium rare. I sent it back and they brought another to the table that was better and was cooked correctly. However I didn't think that there really is a grade of meat lower than choice, I was wrong. Our waiter was the bartender. After I received the second steak the manager came over to check on things and apologized and he altered our bill so that my steak and only my steak was half price. Applebee's needs to buy better meat. Glad we don't have to go back. Sorry for the 3 week delay in posting this review, I haven't had time and was hoping I would forget about it, but it just kept creeping up in my memory. Maybe now that I wrote this review i will be able to forget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6?start=20,,,,,
11,Pate R.,"Duncan, SC",0,66,,1.0,2016-06-08,"as far as dinning in - the place still allows smoking and totally reeks so I vote no. that being said, i enjoy (enjoyed) the carside togo - the staff is like SUPER friendly. recently ordered a couple salads (been doing this weekly for about a month or so - dieting) and this last visit, the salad is like near half the size that I've been getting. i know, i'm dieting so i should just suck it up, but i'm like hungry so - deal with it!  i called the store and said the salads are super small and the mgr's all - ""so, you want to come back and we'll redo the order?"" and I'm like, ""no, I just want you to be aware so the next person who orders a salad doesn't get jipped."" and to that she replied, ""well the salads are made the correct size because they're weighed out..."" and blah blah blah.  so, whatever, I get it, defend your staff, I'm just saying, this visit doesn't match the past several and I'm not just some jerk looking for a free meal, I was trying to make them aware and once I didn't want the ""free-bee"" (assuming driving there and back again can be considered 'free') she jumped down my throat... so guess carside's out too... goodbye crapplebee's, your mediocre salads will be moderately missed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
13,Shannon G.,"East Windsor, CT",27,5,2.0,2.0,2016-06-19,"As far as Applebee's goes this is one of the worst, if I wasn't from out of town I'd make sure to never come back. Service was not good, had to ask for things constantly and the order was wrong. The restaurant felt dirty and dingy. The lettuce was wilted, both steaks cooked wrong. Definitely not up to the beach standards I feel most Applebee's are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
10,Pha T.,"Inman, SC",65,3,27.0,1.0,2016-07-05,"This place is usually good, but tonight was my all time worse! The food was cold and the services sucks!! The restaurant was not busy at all and it was not short stuff either but I waited 20min to order my dinner and appetizer. 25min later I received my appetizer(which was ok) 30min later I received my cold stake dinner. I had to Asked for some A1 and hot sauce never received until my last bite (35min later) along with my bills. She never came by to check up or anything...plus over 2hrs with no refills. Mad as hell customer! Probably will not return to this location. Smoking is still allowed too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
17,Elaine M.,"Lake City, FL",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-07,"This was the worst Applebee's I have ever eaten at in my entire life. I have been eating at Applebee's since my college days, which was over 20 years ago. This Applebee's is the first Applebee's that I had ever eaten in, so I was very disappointed when returning to my hometown, to see how down in the dumps it has become. My disappointment began with our host, who sporting fake aqua-green contacts, and same to be confused as to where everyone in my party was sitting. There are only four people at my party, but he seem to be confused about us all wanting to sit at the same table. There is also no distinct non-smoking section in this restaurant. Although we were supposedly seated in the non-smoking area, I'll smoke from the smoking section drifted to our area. When our food arrived, my husband discovered that the food was not seasoned at all; his broccoli was bland, his steak was lackluster at best, and his potatoes tasted as though they had been microwaved. Who microwaves potatoes that were advertised as fried potatoes? I had the salmon dinner. My salmon was overcooked, my beans tasted as though they'd been  microwaved, and my mashed potatoes were chunky and cold. The only remotely satisfying meal was the double crunch shrimp, which was true to its name. It was indeed quite crunchy. After my husband voiced his displeasure with his meal, the manager came over with a very nonchalant attitude and asked if my husband would like a substitute a meal. The only good thing about this restaurant was our server. All other crewmembers were chatting with each other or being idle. Our original waitress was the bartender, who took forever to ring our drinks because she was also bar tendering. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,
12,Jan S.,"Union, KY",0,20,16.0,1.0,2016-09-18,We love Applebee's but this was the worst experience we have had. The food was not what we expected when we ordered.

9,Brenda B.,"Duncan, SC",8,7,6.0,3.0,2017-01-22,Like the food and price but the one in Greer off 29 hwy. We went in to have lunch and people was at the bar smoking.  My Daugther  is 7 muts.

7,Jennifer M.,"Woodruff, SC",98,3,,1.0,2017-03-14,The line was out the door of people to be sat and no host in sight. There were plenty of open tables but no host/hostess to seat anyone for a while. The smoking at the bar filled up the whole restaurant and I have a 4 month old. That alone almost made me walk out. Our waitress was so slow and only had like 4 tables. We didn't get our appetizer and had to tell the waitress to just take it off our tab when she brought us our food. It took about 30 minutes before she even took our order. Then I had to wait another 10 minutes just to get silverware so I could eat. The experience was horrible. I almost walked out before we even had our order taken because it was taking too long. Probably won't ever be back...at least not to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-spartanburg-6,,,,,

0,Kevin S.,"Marion, NC",17,71,93.0,2.0,2017-09-13,"Two stars because the server was sweet and my beer was cold. If you're hungry and in the mood for bland food I reckon you have one of three choices. 1. You can go across the street to McDonald's 2. You can walk across to Taco Bell. Or 3. You can eat here... It's all bland. McDonald's does give bigger portions though. The manager even said the ""4 cheese mac and cheese"" comes to the restaurant prepackaged!! What? Nothing is made in-house? Nope, just warmed up. Best thing about this place... Beer! But I can get beer in my small town and don't have as far to drive... Won't be back.  Ignore this review at your own risk.
