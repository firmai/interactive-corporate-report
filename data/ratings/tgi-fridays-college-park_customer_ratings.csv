12,H K.,"Adrian, MI",2,325,174.0,1.0,2014-04-30,"Had a long layover. T4 was my gate. So I stopped in for dinner. I would not choose this again. Atmosphere was fine. Service was fine. Menu had no 'pop', I asked for specials, there weren't any, ended up with an appetizer Jack Daniel Trio- fried shrimp, chicken tenders and baby back ribs.  Shrimp was good. Tenders were nasty. All over fried breading. Sent the ribs back on visual alone. Didn't event taste them.  They looked soggy wet like road kill in the rain and they were covered in this jelly like substance. No grill marks. No burnt ends. Nasty with brown marmalade or something. Waitress said that was the JD BBQ?   Good thing I guess. She took $5 off of my bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
13,Mike O.,"Brooklyn, NY",206,1722,570.0,3.0,2014-05-07,"Yo some hater gave this place one star. One star?! Man, did you think this place was Agnostic Secular Humanist Tuesdays?! Or maybe you just had poor service. I got seated right quick, had a delightful server, ate a sandwich and had some coffee. Nothin wrong with that. What are you expecting from chain restaurant airport food? Manage those expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
14,Angela L.,"Draper, UT",11,6,11.0,2.0,2014-10-31,"I came in with my husband after we landed at the airport. They were busy but the wait wasn't very long. I ordered the pick three for all so I can have a little bit of everything. My husband ordered the California Club. The food took a while to get to the table but my husband said his food was fine. Mine didn't turned out so good. My pick three had the potato skin, boneless buffalo wings, and mozzarella sticks. The potato skins were good. But the wings were barely warm, like it was sitting out for awhile. My first mozzarella stick was hollow with no cheese inside so it was just fried breading which our server overheard and immediately told me she would bring me another one. But then I bit into my second mozzarella stick and found a hair inside. I was a bit horrified and told the server when she came back. She apologized and send her manager over. The manager asked what happened and I explained to him the situation. He shrugged and said ""That happens, its the first hair found in the food today. Anyways, I'll take it off your check"" So...does this mean they find hair in the food all the time? The reason I even gave two stars is because the server was really nice and took care of us and we didn't have to pay for that dish. But I am horrified and most likely won't come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
10,Nemil S.,"Boston, MA",46,108,5.0,3.0,2014-12-26,"This restaurant in the T terminal was moderately busy but well organized-- I was seated right away. The server was very polite when I asked to switch my seat to a high top of my choosing.  Tall Bluemoon - $6.49 Cheeseburger - $9.70 - good average cheeseburger, no complaints, nothing too fancy.  It took a little longer than expected for my food to come out---15-20 minutes, so I had to eat faster than I would've liked to make it to my flight.  I have never been to a stand alone TGI Fridays, so I can't compare, but this was a decent spot to eat while waiting for my flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
3,Carol K.,"Chicago, IL",1310,2730,577.0,4.0,2016-03-09,"It's in an airport.  It's packed.  But the staff does a great job of getting you your food and drink on a timely basis.  And when you re tying to get to your plane, that's no small feat! I sat at the bar and Klive, the bartender, took good care of me.  Have your ID ready cuz these people card everyone! I had a perfectly poured martini and a burger and fries.  All were good and came up quickly. Not fancy, afterall it's a TGI Friday's and it's a chain.  But for the quantity of people they were moving through, I give them two thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
2,Chez E.,"Woodbridge, VA",51,64,304.0,5.0,2016-03-25,I typically don't go to TGIF but decided to go while waiting for my flight.  As far as food is concern it was definitely what I expected from Friday's. Had the app platter and it wasn't ground breaking but it served it's purpose. The 5 stars is due to the server LB who was great. He was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our experience after a long conference week.  If I am ever in terminal T in Atlanta I will get a drink at this location and ask for LB.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
6,David And Natalie S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,17,,2.0,2016-05-20,"Shitty service, felt like I was at Mac store.  Took forever to be addressed even though there were at least 5 employees within arms reach.  As far as the rest, it is a Friday's... would you review a HotPocket?  Place appeared clean is reason for extra star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
0,Grace M.,"New York, NY",145,12,,5.0,2016-05-24,"I have been to this TGI Fridays on many many occasions. I always sit at the bar and I always have a great time. Being the Atlanta airport, you never know how long security is going to be and I usually have an hour or 2 to kill before my flight. The team (at the bar) is always cognizant that you are catching a flight, and your bill is always ready when you need it. I decided to review today because I had a shitty week and when I showed my ID, Kathryn noticed it was my birthday tomorrow which made me really happy since I had forgotten myself. She also remembered my name when I had finished my first drink and asked me if I wanted another, but not in a bartender way, in a friend way like she was going to get me another cold one out of her own fridge (if you know what I mean)  On another occasion, the kitchen was slow and I got really anxious and was almost going leave without my food, but then low and behold they came running out with it in to-go bags and I was able to enjoy it on my flight (and yes, I was that jerk eating buffalo wings on a plane. sorry not sorry) Maybe all airport bars have the same attention to timing, but this is the one I keep going to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
8,Sam L.,"Ossining, NY",190,13,2.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"OH MY GOD DONT COME HERE. we came with an hour before our flight and the food still was not out in time. Even after telling the waitress we had to board soon she disappeared and we waited even longer. I can not believe how poor the service is, the wait staff are not even friendly or polite. I would absolutely not recommend. What a waste of time. You would think for an airport restaurant service would at the very least be comparable to other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
7,Jason W.,"Manhattan, NY",18,1,,1.0,2016-06-12,Worst service ever! Not even close to busy and took 20 minutes for anyone to even show up at our table and then another 10 to get us our drinks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
5,Dwayne G.,"Atlanta, GA",5,27,10.0,3.0,2016-06-27,"I stopped at the TGI Friday's on Concourse T at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport for a light dinner and a cocktail before my flight home to Washington, DC. My bartender, Kathryn, was excellent! She was very pleasant, polite, professional & consistent! I only give 3 stars in this review because my food was barely edible but Kathryn made it a very pleasant experience and an enjoyable layover while waiting for my flight home. She is a great representative for the Friday's brand!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
11,J P.,"Lafayette, LA",0,5,3.0,2.0,2016-06-28,"Great menu choice for an airport but horrible execution. Bug in drink, slow service and rubbery chicken. Not worth the price.

9,Janny D.,"Semmes, AL",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-20,"Worst experience ever in an airport restaurant!! This franchise has a terrible policy on checking IDs for alcohol consumption. We are an adult family of 6 wanting to have lunch and a drink before our next flight but one in our group could not get a drink although she was 22 because her ID said under 21 since she got her license before she turned 21. We have never heard of this policy at a TGIFridays. We asked for a manager but she made the situation worse because she couldn't even explain it to us. All she could say was, ""this is our policy"" with an attitude. Actually, all the staff we encountered was not very nice, rude!! At the end of our lunch a waitress came to our table and just started pulling up our blinds next to us saying we need more light in here, she didn't even ask us!! We had put the blinds down because the windows were putting off so much heat. The staff are all just rude, including the manager!! We will never return here again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
4,Katherine L.,"Milton, WI",0,5,,1.0,2017-07-19,"Desperately needs a manager!  Customers needed to be seated but one female employee standing outside near the entrance wasn't doing anything and the girl at the podium was on the phone.  What was she doing on the phone . . . taking reservations?  When I asked if we had to be seated (apparently by the hostess on the phone), I was scolded that the couple in front of us were next.  After I told her I knew they were next, we decided it could only go downhill from there and left.  Pathetic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
1,Ange T.,"Greenville, SC",4,28,36.0,2.0,2017-08-10,The bar was packed with only one bartender.  She could not keep up with making drinks and managing the rest of her tasks; and it showed. All I can say is the airport needs to have another affordable bar in the main terminal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-college-park,,,,,
