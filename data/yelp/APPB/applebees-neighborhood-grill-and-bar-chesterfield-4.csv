Jay N.,"New Baltimore, MI",6,30,1,1.0,10/8/2017,"Chesterfield Applebee's leaves a lot to be desired. The last time I was there I ordered a quesadilla burger and ff. After waiting nearly 40 mins and having to flag down any server who would pay attention, I finally got my food. The burger looked like it was dropped on the floor then scraped back onto my plate, the ff were greasy limp and cold.

Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,64,4.0,8/19/2015,"Applebee's has changed a lot in recent times and it's all for the better! For starters -- their menu has been revamped and expanded. Gone are some of the old favorites (RIP Oriental Chicken Rollup and Southwest Salad) but hello, pretzels, sandwiches, and thai shrimp salad! Their burger list is also quite expansive if that's your forte. Always remember to check out their appetizers as well. I recommend the aforementioned pretzel sticks and onion rings. Seriously, the cheese for the pretzels is to die for! Served hot with plenty of flavor that isn't too much of a spicy kick. Don't want to spend the money on apps? They still offer half off appetizers at a certain time too. If you're looking into the 2 for $20 of 2 for $25 menu, you can also order an entree from either side and the waitress will be gladly split the bill for you. It should come out to $23 for so (apparently most don't realize this!)  Service has improved so much since my last review. Chesterfield may lack some good chain restaurants but at least I know I can count on Applebee's for quality food and good services. Only complaint is that it's sometimes chilly inside. Bring a jacket!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4
Charles J.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",5,8,3,4.0,7/15/2017,Good food and service. I recommend boneless wings and pretzels. Burgers are very good and so are ribs.

Jinda B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,1,4.0,4/13/2016,"Spent a night at the bar with my sis and tried the sangria, which was delightful, and some appetizers.  She had iced tea, which was what she expected.

Carey G.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,27,,3.0,4/8/2017,Its been 4 years since I have been to this restaurant. Last time I was here we walked out after sitting at our table for 20 minutes and never being acknowledged. This time service was better but still slow and the waiter did apologize for his absence. The food was good but the portion was on the small side in my opinion but I guess that's what you get for ordering off the 2 for 20.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4

Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324,1.0,7/17/2014,My boyfriend and I debated where to go late Sunday evening and we decided on Applebees. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks within seconds. Awesome. I was hoping the rest of the meal would be this quick. Wrong! We ordered our food. We were going to get the 2 for $20 meal. I ordered the oriental chicken salad with crispy chicken. The waitress informed us that they don't carry that salad anymore. So we had to find new items to get. I ordered the cheeseburger sliders with fries- no onions or special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the chili lime sirloin. We were informed that was also no longer on the menu and it was a seasonal item. Weird. That too was on the menu. He ordered a sirloin with veggies and redskins.  We also used the free Yelp offer for free pretzels and pub cheese. The waitress was clueless and thought I was lying just to get free food. There was also an advertisement on each table to show free offer when you check in. The appetizer came about 45 minutes after we ordered. Pretzel sticks were pretty well done and hard while the cheese was lukewarm- if that! Food came about 25 minutes after our appetizer. My sliders were over cooked and burnt- they looked worse that Steak N Shake burgers- and they also had onions and special sauce on them. Fries were hard as rocks. My boyfriends sirloin wasn't cooked the way he wanted and his veggies were still frozen while his redskins looked as though they were served to a few customers and reheated four different times. We didn't bother getting new food because we couldn't find our waitress and we were already so sick of waiting as it was. Before we even got our appetizer we seen the manager talk to 5 tables in our section. Doesn't sound like Applebees had a very good night.  Very poor service. We won't be back for awhile. I can't get the taste of burnt burger out of my mouth.  After we left we found articles online about an E Coli breakout in Iowa and Minnesota because of the oriental chicken salad. I wish the waitress would have just told us rather than beat around the bush. Perhaps the restaurant sound have had signs on the menus or door entrances.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4

Erin A.,"Fair Haven, MI",6,14,16,1.0,12/1/2014,"Ok, I give 0 stars.   My cousin and I decided to go here for lunch.  We were seated right away. It took 5 minutes for our server to get out drink order. No big deal. Then it took about 10 for her to come back with the drinks. Getting a little more frustrated.  Soon we get our order placed. I got a ""Chicken Caesar Salad""( (C. C. S.) going to abbreviate later)  with a ""classic turkey sandwich. "" 15-20 minutes later TAKING FOREVER!!! Then finally get our order.  I ""downed"" my turkey sandwich and move on to the C.C.S.  My cousin then says to me...  ""LOOK! You have a fly in your salad!"" I replied ""No I don't! ... Stop fooling around""  ""Take your fork and move your lettuce around!""  ""Ok.""  I then move my lettuce around (obviously), and let out a small scream or a shriek, saying quote, ""OMG!!! Ewwwwww!"", pushing my plate immediately away from me.  People who are nearby look at me and stare to see what is going on..... So, there were about 7 little bugs crawling around IN MY SALAD !!! The best I can describe what they looked like was MINI little, bee, looking things. We get a waitress to find our waitress over to our table. She then goes and gets the manager. He apologized and got me another turkey sandwich, which took a long time to get, and took my order off the bill. The manager said the lettuce must have not been washed. That is unacceptable at a type restaurant like this!  Needless to say I don't have good experiences at Applebee's. I will not be returning for a VERY long time. I can get better quality food for the same price, somewhere else....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4

Alex K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",227,398,378,2.0,10/26/2013,"Oh for Christ's sake, people. First of all, it wasn't my decision to come here. I was told, ""Oh! It's better than it was before! I promise!"" I constantly see hoards of sheep hurrying in here, and Applebee's is almost always packed to the rafters when I drive by. I wound up getting some sort of garlic shrimp and steak ""Under 550 Calories"" dish. It didn't suck, but it wasn't great. First, I asked for medium rare, but the steak was well-done. I didn't have them take it back because I was too damn hungry, and the steak wasn't overcooked to the point where it was dry or burnt or anything. It was edible. Also, the vegetables were only half-cooked (some places do that on purpose to give texture). It didn't taste bad at all, but it wound up costing about $16 for that and a bowl of the tomato basil soup, which also was alright, but luke warm. I didn't want to come here to begin with, and I'm sorry I did. I'd much sooner go to a place like Ruby Tuesday if I'm forced to go to some sort of chain restaurant nearby. Two stars because the steak was cooked too long, and the prices are waaay too high. If that's not enough, it seemed nearly as cold inside as it did outside on a 40 degree day. What, didn't pay your bill? Still not a fan of Applebee's, and I don't plan to go back. Don't waste your time (and especially money) coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4

Rubberized chicken and shrimp with about 7 potatoes. I also tried the chicken tortilla soup. Yuck! Everything was slightly warm and looked like crap. Our server although pleasant to speak to was to busy grabbing the cocky male host to flirt with the underage girls in the booth behind us. Making them place the guess my age game...finally they nailed it at 34.  Grand total for 2 drinks, 1 entree, soup, salad and a dessert. $43 for hot garbage. The only reason I even gave 2 stars was the drinks and desserts. But at the end of the day if you want a late night meal go to Taco Bell.

The service is always bad - the past two times they had excuses; what do you know but tonight was the same - their cook called and and they were short servers?! I should not know this - but it's how my server greeted us upon coming to take our drink order.  So this lack of staff apparently gave our server the freedom to ""gossip"" for 20 minutes - while my daughter had no ranch in her chicken strip basket-? Yes as a good mom I gave mine up.

Scott M.,"Washington, MI",2,48,2,2.0,10/5/2014,"Stopped in for a beer and a burger. I have been to this Applebee's years ago when I lived closer. They redecorated, it's more contemporary , and the updated look was nice. I arrived at noon and sat at the bar, I was eating solo, so I thought this would give me the fastest service. There was nobody at the bar and a few tables were occupied in the bar area. The service was good. Ordered a draft beer and a burger. that's when it started to get funky!!! As the bar tender was filling my mug , Fruit flies everywhere!! This is a sure sign of a dirty back bar!! One of my pet peeves. I do have to say the burger and fries were good. The burger was juicy and had a nice flavor. I just had to wait a moment as the server  retrieved  some silverware for me. The manager stopped by to ask how everything was. I told him""good, however, you should look into the fruit fly problem"". He seemed to have knowledge of the problem and assured me that someone would be out the next day. I was going to give a one star , however the food was good and standard fare for the chain style restaurant. The dirtiness was a turn-off and I would never think about bringing friends or family here.

Both dishes contained the brisket, it was soooooo salty we couldn't eat it. It tasted as if it was a boil in the bag meal and reheated.  Everything was tasteless and dry.  Very sad but it sometimes happens. We did tell our server who was awesome, but it's not her fault.

The restaurant wasn't too busy. We were sat down in a booth on the far left side of the restaurant. No one served us for 10 minutes. We ended up getting up and sitting at the bar. We were immediately greeted by Randal and Crystal. It started off good until we waited forever for our cheese sticks. 20 minutes later, we got them with the littlest side of ranch. They said the Marinera will be on its way. The girl who brought us it out said she would bring us the Marinera. Her name was either Jessica or chelsea. She was bright blonde with a flower pulled up in her hair. She never went back to the kitchen once. She sat at the bar with some guy and had conversation with him for a whole hour while staring back at us. Not even acknowledging that she forgot. Then Randall came back and said you didn't want bruschetta on your pasta right? I said no. 15 minutes later it came back out and the girl said did you ask for the pasta with the side of bruschetta. I said no I didn't ask for it at all. Randall made a nasty comment saying well it's the same thing so yeah. I never got a breadstick with my meal either like you are suppose to. I asked for one and they never brought me it. After we got our food, they just sat around and were conversating with people at different tables sitting down and acting like it was a party. Waiters were texting, one was having a beer with another customer. Very unprofessional in my opinion. And it looked like the managers didn't give two cares in the world what was going on.

Cheryl B.,"Fair Haven, MI",0,2,,4.0,3/20/2016,"OK, I like to be fair so will update my original review to reflect our most recent visit to this location.  I went to another location a month ago with my daughter in law (at her request) and it was basically / mostly terrible so won't go into that... amazingly, this time (2 days ago) at this location ~ was with my hubby (who said he would never return) but it was at our 5 year old granddaughter's request (he is putty in her hands.. ;0}.  We did not respond or contact Jasmine regarding her post (we just feel that it sometimes comes out that someone is trying to get something for nothing so we didn't do that).. anyway, my point is: they didn't have any reason to know who we were or anything like that on this visit.  Immediately, we weren't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  Our server Jon, was EXCEPTIONAL ~ he was attentive but not overly so, checked on us at basically all the right times, explained some of the dishes and knew the answers to the questions we asked (no, we did not mention our problems in the past).  We ordered quite a few different dishes and ALLLLL came out at the correct temperature for eating.  We did have a problem with some of the available sauces though... taste wise, we felt that we were more eating at somewhere like Chili's (which we enjoy but did not choose this time) than at what is supposed to be concerned traditional American... basically every sauce has some sort of spice or heat to it or is smoke flavored... Applebee's truly needs to add a sweet and sour, a honey BBQ, a thousand island type for onion rings... etc..... just one or two more that does not have some sort of heat to the bite.  We added on to our order in the middle of eating our first orders and he didn't make us feel like we were bothering him.  Everything was clean; including the bathrooms... We were 'checked' on my management at two different times .. first was after receiving our drinks by a woman (didn't catch her name), then by Ken while we were eating who was checking to make sure all was well with us.  One problem that we didn't like (and didn't mention) was we were up on the higher level second booth in and there was never less than 4 employees standing at the door chatting away.  Only one was seating customers and the 3 others never left while a few others came and went.  We heard ALLLL of their entire conversations;; nothing bad, mind you BUT we really don't need to know the lives of the young ladies working there and/or their complaints about working conditions/customers etc.... we were there between 4-6pm on a Friday so they were not empty and there MUST of been something for those ladies to do.  Truly just doesn't look good to have employees standing around in a group for soooooo long anyway (busy or not).  Anyway, to wrap this up; this visit was a vast improvement and we did tell Jon that we would write a review and mention his service (because he earned it).   More than likely, we would/will come back but because of family not the menu .. we just didn't feel like we were physically satisified when we left but our granddaughter Loved her 3 cheese chicken mac & cheese and strawberry yogurt meal and the chicken nuggets (but thank goodness I happened to have a pack of Chicken Shack BBQ in her bag or that would of been a flop  ~~ a good grandma ALWAYS has a bag of the kiddies faves ;0}",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4?start=40
Stacy B.,"Algonac, MI",48,42,6,1.0,5/22/2013,"I was very disappointed in my last visit to Applebee's. I ordered an appetizer of their hot spinach dip. When it got to our table, it was cold and runny. I was disgusted with the way it looked, and unfortunately it tasted worse. We requested a new appetizer, they brought out the same exact spinach dip that we had sent back, but this time it was hot.  I spoke to the wait staff, and she said she would take it off our bill- which didn't happen. Our overall experience was unpleasant, and we most likely won't be back for some time, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4?start=40
Yata W.,"New Baltimore, MI",1,10,5,5.0,7/28/2014,"I eat here all the time. The Bourbon Street chicken or steak with shrimp is great. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. I only had a problem with my food one time and it was because the cook was new. The manager was made aware of my dissatisfaction (without me having to ask for the manger) and gave me a discount on my order. After that, I never had another problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4?start=40
J C.,"New Baltimore, MI",0,38,,1.0,10/29/2014,"Just a follow up to my review I did the Survey on the receipt explaining my bad experience. I was asked whether i would like to be contacted regarding my experience i said yes. To my surprise no one ever contacted me, just another example of how Applebees does not care about their customers. Shame on them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4?start=40

Sandy S.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,3,,1.0,3/9/2013,"My family and I came in here the other night with high standards. The place was a zoo and we were on a wait. The hostess had a bunch of open tables and the manger wasn't helping to seat. We finally sat down, the food was okay, not the greatest. Some manager named Connie was so rude to us and the table, let's just say were not coming back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chesterfield-4?start=40
