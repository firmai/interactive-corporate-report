9,Andrea B.,"Des Moines, IA",191,167,132.0,4.0,2012-11-13,The only location (to my knowledge) that has $2.50 long island's all day everyday! SO good and an amazing deal!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
11,Bill L.,"Ankeny, IA",215,690,899.0,5.0,2014-02-26,"I always enjoy going to Applebees to satisfy my late night cravings for comfort food, especially when they have their half off appetizers. This Applebee's is no different from any other I've been to, they are calm with their low light atmosphere and have friendly staff. Food is always good. For mr personally, I enjoy eating their appetizers more than their entrees. Also their desserts are great if you are still able to eat after a big meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
10,Nam K.,"Ankeny, IA",9,74,162.0,4.0,2015-06-04,"We always have good service there. The food is good and the quality is consistent. Can't beat the happy hour deals in food. Appetizers are half off after 9. Some locations in bigger cities are 10. Call ahead to make sure. Patrons vary from families with small kids to high school students, to older folks. It has a small town feel to it. We like it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
3,David R.,"Chicago, IL",31,68,24.0,3.0,2015-07-17,"3 stars is for the atmosphere and service. It's a standard Applebee's. Sat at the bar. Bartender is good. Quick and pays attention.  My order came out as ordered.  I love salmon.  I'm on a mission to mark down restaurants who can't cook salmon. I guarantee the wait staff is screwing the cooks by letting the salmon over cook under the heat lamp.  I got the low cal savory salmon dish. I'm glad they are offering lower calorie dishes that aren't soaked in butter and covered in mashed potatoes. This dish is pretty darn good- IF the salmon wasn't dry and over-cooked.   I bet the salmon was pink when it went on the plate. You can't let salmon sit under the heat lamp at all. I'd rather have perfectly cooked salmon even though I'm not quite done with my salad than have dry, over-cooked salmon. Watch any cooking instructional video. Proteins continue to cook when you take them off the heat. Anyway- 3 stars for service and meeting Applebee's expectations for a chain.  If they would not overcook proteins under the heat lamp, they would have 5 stars. *End rant*.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
7,Chris C.,"Marietta, OK",7,79,27.0,4.0,2015-12-23,"Pretty typical Applebee's.  Food and service were fine and the Iowa IPA was excellent BUT our waiter was new and it looked like the bartender was pretty much ignoring him when he went to get his drink orders.  I had finished my meal before I got my beer and I watched him take the drinks back to the bar from 2 different tables near us.  I'm not sure what was going on, but when our waiter checked 6 times after placing our order before my draft was ready, something is wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
8,Tony D.,"Ankeny, IA",67,19,7.0,4.0,2016-01-19,My wife and I ate dinner there last night and it was burger night. We were going to get the two for 20 and we ordered it we realized it was burger night we asked Ryne our server if we could change and he changed our order promptly. The burgers were amazing the service was great and our drinks were refilled promptly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,

5,Erin C.,"Ankeny, IA",1,7,,1.0,2016-12-21,"SUPER disappointed. My hubby and I have a couple of fave Ankeny restaurants and we usually stick to them, but tonight we took a chance on Applebees Carside To Go. We saw some delicious looking nachos on the app menu & decided to go with an ALL appetizers night. We got the Nachos for $10.99, boneless wings, cheese sticks and Cheese Burger egg rolls. Total cost $33.36 not including tip. What a LET DOWN. The nachos came separated with literally a handful (I counted 12 chips) & 3 small containers: shredded cheese, melted cheese, and hamburger meat. No lettuce, no tomatoes, no sour cream and we had to put it all together ourselves. We were also missing one order of cheeseburger egg rolls. When I called the restaurant we were told the egg rolls had ""fallen"" out of the bag, and that the nachos to go are sent in separate containers so the chips don't get soggy. I get that, but we order nachos all the time from other places and they come all put together without a problem. Plus, $10.99 for 12 chips and some meat & cheese seems a bit of a rip off. So, off my husband went across town again to get the forgotten appetizer and while I'm waiting I figured I'd write this honest review. In the future, we'll stick to the places we've always gotten great service from rather than risk wasting our money and our taste buds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
1,Genevieve W.,"Ankeny, IA",110,680,821.0,5.0,2016-12-28,"Host was friendly and we got seated right away, they were awesome to accommodate my mom's limitations of not being able to get in and out of booth's easily.  The server was incredibly friendly! Always making sure our waters were full and recommending items and different sauces!  We did the 2 for $20 meal which had 2 entrees and an appetizer for $20, the oriental chicken salad was fantastic! It was a huge portion, with almost more of a slaw type salad and tons of crispy chicken. My husband had the chicken tenders with the sweet potato fries, these were phenomenal, especially with a sauce our waiter recommended, which was a maple cream cheese type sauce. It was as the waiter said Awesome Sauce!! We had the spinach artichoke dip which was very good! We also ordered the pretzels with beer cheese appetizers, they were a little greasy but they had good flavor, especially the beer cheese sauce!  Overall great experience, drinks were refilled right away, service was great!, food was good! Will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
4,Brandon K.,"Ankeny, IA",45,2,,5.0,2017-01-09,I was very pleased with the service.  I ordered the Bourbon Chicken with Shrimp and it was fantastic. I recommend this restaurant for all ages,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
2,D P.,"Ankeny, IA",0,12,,1.0,2017-06-28,"Tried to visit Applebee's for lunch today but stood at the door being ignored by 4 servers.  The restaurant was not busy but we stood waiting to be seated.  Only one server spoke to us to say, ""I'll be with you in a minute.""  No one greeted us and 3 other servers walked right by us. There were very few customers seated.  We ended up leaving and having lunch at another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
0,Nate N.,"Des Moines, IA",2,44,1.0,4.0,2017-09-30,Cheap food. The service is always great if your dining in. The bar is usually slow. The food is timely and prices are even better. Just your typical Applebee's. Nothing out of the ordinary. Great for families and a casual night out with a loved one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ankeny-3,,,,,
