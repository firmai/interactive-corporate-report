This happens to be my husband and I's ""go to"" when we don't know what else to eat or don't feel like cooking! I love it here. Most the staff is super friendly and helpful with the menu. You really cannot beat the prices - half off apps all day sunday?! thats awesome!  I always get the green bean fries and the potstickers... both incredible. my husband normally just gets a burger and fries or sweet potato fries with a beer on tap. This is a regular casual dining experience which I strongly prefer over all the rest of them [chilis, applebess ect]. Sometimes my water tastes like the frenchtown roller rink but I just send it back and get fresh water and its all good.

37,Colene B.,"Annandale, NJ",44,13,,1.0,2013-01-29,"My Daughter  and I went to Fridays in Flemington tonight, we sat on the couches for a drink and appetizer. Nobody came to take our order as promised so i went to the bar. Upon returning, i found lip marks on my glass, so I walked it back up. It happens. The bar tender placed the wine to the side and poured me a new one. I thought it was odd that she didnt dump the wine, and continued to watch. When I got back to the seat, we found pink lips on my daughers soda glass, so back up I went. The bar tender was talking to friends and didnt see me.. I saw her tho.. she wiped the lips from my old glass and placed it in the service bar area. When she came over, the manager was walking by, I told him what I saw, she overheard and quickly dumped the wine and denied it. Im not sure what was going on, but I will tell you, Im not going back to that filthy place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
28,Talia W.,"Highland Park, NJ",0,12,1.0,3.0,2013-05-25,"I just had dinner here; this was my first experience at a TGI Friday's at all and it was pretty good! I am a vegan, so this review is specifically about that aspect of the experience.  Summary in one line: they can be pretty accommodating to vegans and are willing to help with anything they can! I was initially hesitant about going to an American chain restaurant like this because of expectations of a very unfriendly environment for vegans and also having read the menu and not seeing much. However, I gave them a call in the morning to ask them about how accommodating they would be for special dietary constraints and the manager sounded very willing and helpful. So I figured... okay! I went with my friend and his parents on a Saturday evening. It was pretty packed, but after about a 7-10 minute wait the four of us were seated at a booth near the bar. The booth was a little noisy and at times I couldn't hear my friend talking right next to me, but that environment was entirely understandable, so no complaints there. Note: they don't take reservations, but they do take some sort of ""priority reservation""; that is, we called ahead and when we got there we had priority for the next open table over other walk-ins waiting. Since I had called ahead earlier in the day, I believe they recognized me pretty quickly. I asked them the typical vegan questions and they were very helpful and were able to make some adjustments. We got a bruschetta appetizer, sans parmesan, and it was loaded with tomatoes and very tasty. My friend got the sizzling chicken and shrimp, his dad got a rack of ribs, and his mom got salmon and shrimp. I got a black bean burger (they checked the ingredients and it IS vegan) with avocado, tomato, lettuce, onions, BBQ sauce, and broccoli on the side. They are also totally fine with cooking in anything you bring and give to them - I brought some of my own daiya cheese and they happily topped off my burger in melty cheesy goodness. It was all sandwiched together in some nice toasty rye bread. I really loved the meal and thought it was delicious! My friend also notes that the chicken was pretty standard fare, a little lacking in flavor and thus he was borrowing the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce from the other dishes, but the shrimp was good. We ended the meal with some fresh fruit and the whiskey cake with pecans and ice cream. For me, the most noteworthy thing about this place is the great and friendly service, how accommodating they are to new situations (they never dealt with a vegan like me but they were perfectly fine with deviating from the menu), and how helpful they are. That being said, it's still an American chain restaurant, and the food is greasy and doesn't have a whole lot of healthy options. But you don't go to TGI Friday's for that - so, for what it was, I think it was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

27,Liz C.,"Flemington, NJ",17,1,,1.0,2015-07-05,"Today I was at Friday's I am a regular customer I go there very often but this particular day I was with a few friends and we went to eat and have a few beers. After getting 12 beers between 2 people within 5 hours we got told that they can no longer serve us alcohol. We were playing pool calmly and quietly while watching the game of USA vs Japan. The bartender John told us the manager had told him that we cannot be served anymore alcohol, but John had said said he had no issues with serving us more alcohol due to us not being a issue or causing a commotion. We asked the manager why the other group of people in front of us were still drinking if they were there even before we got there and they had already been drinking when we got there. We asked her if it was racism towards the color of our skin. We asked for the corporate number so we could make a complaint to this issue. She gave us a faulty number which lead to no where. We paid the bill and left. While waiting for the taxi to arrive to pick us up. The manager Maggie had called the police saying we were a threat to the property. The police had flashed me and my friends in the face with the flashlight. They asked why we were sitting outside of the property. We responded we were simply waiting for the taxi to pick us up. They said we cannot be in the property. These policemen approached us as if we were criminals doing something wrong when we were simply leaving because she said we can only stay to watch the t.v but we left instead . The police told us that we couldn't wait for the taxi at Friday's and that we had to wait at Dunkin donuts. The big issue is that we are a latino group of friends. We weren't making any noise while drinking we were just having fun. Yet we got told we couldn't have anymore alcohol even though the white group in front of us drank more than us and stayed longer and even laughed when Maggie said we couldn't drink anymore. I feel very offended to this and this shouldn't even be a issue in Friday's. We love the place and it's a great place to eat and drink and relax with friends.  One reason we love this place is also the great bartender John. He's very nice towards us and anyone who comes.

I went in with my siblings (5 of us total) one day around 3:30 and got sat at a round table and our server Kat came over to take our drink orders. We asked to get moved to a booth and it was like the end of the world, she cleared off a booth that the servers were using to sit at, I've worked in restaurants I get this can be annoying but in a mostly empty place I figured it wasn't that big of a deal. From there is was downhill, I've honestly never felt more unwelcome for NO reason. Kat went to a coworker and asked really loudly ""can you switch tables with me please?!"" And the answer was obviously no, she reluctantly came back to us. Three of us did the endless apps, one got just fries, and the last needed his meal to go but had to leave before it was ready and she had some rude comment to add about that; we just told her to leave it at the table and we will take it home. When I asked my brother if he'd like to try some wings for the next round of apps she said ""that's not allowed you can't share"" and i said oh well he's only going to have one, trying to be light and funny even though I was feeling shamed and like I should leave.

2,Darren B.,"Lambertville, NJ",6,89,13.0,2.0,2017-10-28,Got the new 30% bigger ribs for 12.99. Man I'd be pissed if they were over 15 and can't imagine them 30% smaller. Subbed Brussels and was upset for the $3.00 dollar up charge. Web said 99 cents. Overall was not happy ribs did not have a lot of meat and I ate the whole rack and two sides. Disappointed. Wish I would have the ribs at more than Q in Lambertville. Rib are more than twice as big.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
