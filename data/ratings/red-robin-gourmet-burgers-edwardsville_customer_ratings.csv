39,Brooke R.,"Pawnee, IL",8,116,5.0,2.0,2012-02-05,I have visited this location 3 times. The first two were good but my last visit was not. I ordered my burger medium and it was raw. I mean raw as in still cold in the middle. My other two guests ordered theirs well done and theirs weren't as raw as mine but still under cooked. The server never came back until she was ready to give us a bill. Unfortunately that was enough to turn me off of Red Robin for a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=20,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

The Spinach Artichoke appetizer is back-gotta get that. I inquired as to what happened because we were so turned off from the place that we haven't gone back until recent. I was greeted by the new manager. She has really turned that place around, as evident by a now busy parking lot.

29,Jacob C.,"Glen Carbon, IL",5,5,1.0,1.0,2013-04-10,"We attempted to eat at this Red Robin location on Friday. I was looking forward to watching the Cardinal game while enjoying a burger and bottomless fries with my family. However, after being seated and waiting for over 5 minutes (yes I even used the stopwatch app on my phone) we still hadn't seen a single server. It would be understandable (though not entirely excusable) if they had been busy, but we were one of maybe 4 or 5 tables in the entire dining area. At that point, we got up and went to the St Louis Bread Co next door (which was great btw).  Understanding that employees get breaks, it did not help to see a group of 5 employees hanging out on the patio as we left. After placing our order at Bread Co, I walked back over to talk to the manager of RR (Jim) to tell him of the atrocious LACK of service, and that we would not be back for quite a while (if ever). It had been some time since we had tried Red Robin, due to receiving poor service in the past.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised to say things haven't changed. The place was maybe 1/5 full, pretty slow when we got there. We were on a tight time frame and all knew what we wanted, so sat down, ordered everything. It took awhile to get our food. The manager was barking at the employees that he needed 'runners'.. well, we could see our order sitting in the window for a good 10 minutes before it was brought to us. Why didn't the manager take it himself (like any decent manager) instead of yelling at his workers to take it to a table that wasn't theirs?  The fries: Soggy, as usual. As soon as the meals arrived, the fries were cold and soggy so we asked for a basket of 'well done' fries. Guess what? They never came. We changed it up from burgers and went with chicken sandwiches. The chicken was cold and rubbery, WAY overcooked. Towards the end we asked for our check and a couple of boxes because everything had taken so long, and we had somewhere to be.. The waitress then went and took orders from two more tables, didn't come back for another 15 minutes, at that point everyone was in the car ready to go.. so I boxed up the two meals for the kids and left a decent tip for the bad service, considering.. One saving grace was the short stack of onion rings, pretty good, but I guess hard to screw up. I must have eaten at 10 different RR's around the country, I don't know why this one is consistently horrible both in service and food quality.

Our server Seth did a great job of keeping our drinks full even though the place was busy.

I thought Red Robin was fast food, but it isn't really, and so I ordered food since I was dying in starvation.  My boyfriend and I started with drinks & appetizers, we got something like ' bacon fries ' and in terms of drinks, we got ' strawberry lemonade( their special )  & lemonade itself '   The drink tasted heavenly and it was really refreshing. Not only did the drinks taste fantastic, our server went beyond my expectations.  I'm really bad at stories but like, our Dinka were able to be refilled & our server refilled our drinks without us asking. A few minutes later, she brought another one knowing we were going to finish the one we refilled. Bomb service at that point.  Our food came, we ordered burgers! We ordered a bacon cheeseburger & a mac and cheese burger, they were really good & you get to choose sides! We got fries & mac and cheese as our sides. After we got our food, the manager I think came to our table to ask about food and asked how it was, obviously said it was good! :)  A few moments later, our server comes and ask if we want anything else in addition to what we ordered. We added a side and we got it within moments!  Service was really good, so was our food! Thanks for serving us, we will def be back!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
0,Erin R.,"Granite City, IL",16,3,2.0,3.0,2017-08-06,"This was our first time trying Red Robin. All we knew about it was unlimited fries and heard burgers are good.  Started out by ordering 2 Gueniss 22oz draft beers. I immediately noticed that they have a drink called Absolutely Absolut Freckled Lemonade. I located the waitress right away to change my drink order. This was not difficult because they weren't busy because out visit was in between lunch and dinner. Waitress was very nice and said the switch was no problem at all.   Drinks arrived shortly after ordering. The Freckled Lemonade is amazing and I highly recommend it.  But the Guinness was only a 16oz and as you see above we ordered 22oz. My husband didn't mind just the 22oz and didn't say anything.   Food was subpar and nothing special. Unlimited fries, felt like we were begging for more. They give you about 6-8 fries with your meal. When asking for more, waitress brought 10-15 more for the 4 of us to split.  While waiting for the bill I noticed the tablet on the table and looked at the bill. Couldn't believe that we were charged for the bigger beer and $1.99 entertainment fee.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. It's basically Applebees with ""unlimited fries"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
5,Courtney F.,"Glen Carbon, IL",95,49,13.0,2.0,2017-08-07,You can get a better burger at many other places in town for a cheaper price. The menu In general is over priced. It's a typical chain restaurant with sub par food and service. They have a few things going for them.. bottomless fries and their freckled lemonade. Not somewhere I choose to dine unless it's the other persons choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
4,Cecily B.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,23,31.0,5.0,2017-10-06,I loved every part of this restaurant. The workers were super friendly and fast. The prices are very reasonable and there is six of us and we are for $65 dollars and that included 2 alcohol drinks. Oh and who doesn't love bottomless fries!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
6,Larry B.,"Glendale Heights, IL",2,5,135.0,2.0,2017-10-15,This is a typical Red Robin. I am concerned with the cleanliness of this location; found two hairs in two different sandwiches from today's visit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
1,Doc H.,"Edwardsville, IL",0,18,20.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"We've been here a number of times and, for the most part, enjoyed the food and drinks. A good alternative to some of the other restaurants in Edwardsville without a lengthy wait. A bit overpriced for what you get. This was the first time we've ordered online. I was disappointed with the portions in the carryout order. My clucks and Fries had 4 clucks and 9 fries.... Disappointing considering you get bottomless fries if you dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
