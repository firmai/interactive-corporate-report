39,Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699.0,3.0,2012-04-01,"It is a chain restaurant... Service was great today. Restroom was very clean, which is always a plus for me. Tried several of the deal items. For the pick 3 appetizer, tried the new cheese steak slider. Seasoned well, but not enough filling. Wings & southwest egg rolls were as expected. Decided to steep outside my comfort zone & not get ribs! Decided to try the Crispy Honey-Chipolte Chicken Crispers.  Decent tasting, but nothing truly to write home about. Wife had the Chicken Club Quesadillas.  Same verdict...as expected taste wise, and nothing to brag on. All in all, a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000004

He also forgot to tell the kitchen no cheese on my mash potatoes, as I am allergic to milk.  It was not even busy, but it was not worth our time to even complain!

The chicken is not a chicken breast but processed chicken patty.  Really?  I'm not at McDonalds!   They used to have a Cajun rubbed steak that was amazing.  If I'm going to spend $40 my meal it better taste good!  Also, the place was not crowded and it took a long time for our food.   I also noticed that the hostess cleans the table before seating you.  Why not clean and spray the tables before your customers come in so they don't have to wait.  Wow!  Whoever is managing this place needs a lesson on how to run a restaurant.   Sorry Chili's!  We used to think your places were good but we will never be back.  Also if your not careful the kiosk will charge you 99 cents for playing a game.   Now I know why the parking lot was not crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20,1.512,1.512,1.512,1.512,1.512
54,Jacqueline R.,"Stafford, TX",4,12,1.0,4.0,2014-11-07,"Visited this Chili's location on a Friday night. It was packed and we arrived around 8pm. For a table for 2, we were told that there was a 20 minute wait. We were seated in only 10 minutes. The manager actually seated us, seemed that before we got there, some customers were not happy about being told incorrect wait times. I must say that the primary reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the hostesses. They serious suck. You are the first person to interact with the customer, why are you not facing the door??? After coming up from behind the hostess and giving her a scare, we were seated. The food was excellent, the waitress was efficient. I never had to ask for a refill, never had to look around for her. Excellent service.  This particular location has been the best chili's spot by far. The Pearland location is awful, the Sugarland location is dreadful, the Katy location on I-10 is horrible, but this one saves the entire chain! I can't speak for the large parties, they seemed to have a different experience, one lady even told me that the hostess lie about the wait times.

30,Sean R.,"Richmond, TX",5,5,,1.0,2014-12-08,Just left this Chili's location at hwy 99 and westheimer without even eating.  I walked in with a friend to no host. We decided to sit in the bar side although there was no bartender at that station either. We did see someone walking around after a few minutes that we identified as the host from last time we came in 2 weeks ago. He came to the bar area and spoke with another customer less than 10 feet away from us that was sitting at the bar alone. No greeting at that point or let me get someone for you. We had decided on what we wanted and after over 15 minutes my friend actually had to get up and go in the employees only back area to complain we had still not been assisted.  Shortly thereafter we gave our drink orders only to see the host from last time who also took the order this time around go behind the bar.  He started then flipping through a book to figure out how to make our drink which was their featured drink 901 blackberry smash. At that point we decided it was our best bet to leave. I am writing this review from a different Chili's at I-10 and mason rd because we wanted the food and drinks we saw at the original location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

34,Debbie J.,"Katy, TX",0,4,,1.0,2015-02-03,"I have been eating at the same Chili's restaurant out here in Katy for 8 years. In the last couple of years I have been going about 2-3 times a week. On January 2nd, I had a horrible experience there and I was given a business card to make a complaint which I did via email. I left on vacation for two weeks and when I got back I went to Chili's. I saw one of the managers there that I like and she heard my complaint, apologized, paid for my meals, and I left a happy, satisfied, complaint-resolved customer!! On January 26th, I receive a phone call from a man in the Corporate office of Chili's in Dallas stating that he wanted to talk about my dining experience. He called me on Tuesday, January 27th, and he did not talk to me about my experience at all. He immediately told me that I was no longer welcome to dine at the Chili's Restaurant!! I was in total shock! I hadn't done anything wrong except to make a complaint! I contacted KPRC Channel 2 News last Tuesday and they called me right back and wanted to do a story on it. Keith Garvin, Anchor and Reporter with Channel 2 News came to my home on short notice with the camera lady and did the story. Well, today I asked them if they were going to air it and they said no because Chili's never responded to their phone calls which is shocking to me. News stations do stories all the time without permission; I don't know why they needed Chili's approval to do the story. Anyway, this was sad to me as I loved eating there; it was my favorite restaurant. I even celebrated my 55th birthday there back on August 1st!! What an injustice to their best customer ever!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

56,Jeremy L.,"Richmond, TX",1,90,14.0,1.0,2015-02-16,"The food was pretty good. They have made some significant changes in the flavors since my last visit. My wife and I decided to give it another try and would have been happy if the table next to us wasnt so roudy.  The new electronic order menu from their table flew to ours. If manager would have asked them to sit not jump up and down in the booth that might have stopped it.    I approached the manager homer garza.  Who was more like homer simpson from the smell of booze and inability to manage.  I started with the good food ,great service but the table behind me, only to be cut off with we cant control our guests. (Ok card and corp number please.)   The server came over asked what was wrong I told her she apologized then the manager reappeared with the card spouting he cant control, only to be cut off by me saying my conversation didnt concern him he had made his managerial decision already.  Thats when he asked me to leave. I informed him that is one way of controlling a guest just the wrong one.  I think when I informed him the booze was clouding his judgments he wanted to hit me. Corp called me assured me he didnt want to hit me and would i give them another chance( face twitch is what was my first indicator that he wanted to pumble me)  No They will send 40 gift card they say but thats not the point.  If this manager is this way at work how will he react on the streets.  I will keep an eye out so as not to get attacked by what appeared to be a drunk hostile manager, we will also avoid at all cost risking our safety at a place that had no concern of people getting hit with electronic order kiosks.

38,James P.,"Tomball, TX",11,150,4.0,1.0,2015-06-17,"We returned to this location about 2 weeks ago and were really regretted it. They recently remodeled the inside which makes it look completely different than the old Chili's style we were used to. It's now kind of depressing inside. Our first sign that things were not going to be good was when the parking lot was pretty empty for a Friday night. We should have known better! We ordered the queso which came out completely inedible. It was thick as mud and was chocked full of beans. We asked the server for a new one and he said they only make one batch of queso a day so we were stuck with it. We told him we were not going to eat it as it was nasty. The main entrees came out and they were disgusting too. All the food was cold and not fresh. The quality went downhill. The boneless wings were cold and my wife's chicken was cold too. I then called over the manager and advised her that the meal was totally unacceptable. The food was terrible and I wouldn't eat it in fear of getting sick. She even looked at the queso and remarked that it didn't look right. I told her we would pay for our alcoholic drinks and that was it. On another note, the cleanliness of the establishment was also not to par. The floors were filthy and there was food and utensils all over the place. It was not clean. If the dining area was not clean, I cannot imagine what the kitchen looked like! I had to use the restroom during the meal and that was gross too. It looked like it had not been serviced in ages. It stunk, the floor was completely wet and there were towels everywhere. Someone took a huge dump in one of the stalls, didn't clean up and there was poop on the floor! Usually, when a restaurant remodels, things turn around and it's a pleasure to visit. This Chili's is now depressing and nasty. I now know why there was nobody in the parking lot on a Friday night! We will not be returning.  We did not eat our food as we didn't think it was safe to. My stomach would have been out of control and I would have needed to wear a Depends for about 24 hours in fear of soiling myself.  Chili's is going downhill unfortunately. There are way too many other options in the area that offer quality, edible food with a clean atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

First off, a couple of reviews have noted the smell when you walk in this place. I immediately noticed a bad smell when I walked in, so the previous reviews have some merit. It didn't take us long time get seated, but it did take us literally forever to get our food. I can't blame this on our server, he did as good of a job as he could considering he was juggling about 6 tables. The restaurant was clearly shortstaffed tonight and it showed. We only ordered soup, salad, and a kids pizza, and we literally didn't get our food for over an hour. We finally got our salad and then had to wait another 10 minutes for our soup.

They brought he wrong appetizer. And had to take it back. And then asked to take out order before we even had an appetizer. We told him we would wait for the appetizers. A little later the other drink came out. Refills? Forget about it. That would never happen. We tried to order a second beer. It came at the end of dinner and we told them to take it off we were ready to go. Food is over priced for the quality. Service is non existence.

I waited several months and tried to order again recently and of course part of my order, my side salads that I paid extra for, were missing. I don't even bother calling anymore. They're just awful.

I think I'm done. Shame. I usually love Chili's. Older blonde manager actually said that since I hadn't bitten into the burger she was legally allowed to re/cook it.

6,Renata S.,"Katy, TX",7,75,17.0,1.0,2016-11-23,"I don't leave this negative review lightly... It takes a lot for me to give such a poor rating. But we gave them every chance, and they just didn't deliver. Now I know why they have a 2-star average rating. I went there because we hadn't been in years, it's here close to home, and I'd been going to Chili's since I was a teen! My husband and I even went there while dating, and I took my kids there as babies (other locations of course)... So why not? They have a diverse menu anyway... But we will not be back. Not only did the food take 40 minutes to arrive (burger, chicken tenders, ribs, and a turkey sandwich)... But it just wasn't good. Even the chips and guac/salsa were very disappointing. I can go to HEB, Kroger, or even Target and purchase way better Tortilla chips and dips! My simple Turkey sandwich was greasy (not in a good way!), the bun soggy w mayo and butter, and not tasty. The onion rings were over-battered, the French fries under-cooked, and the Mac & Cheese thick and pastey. My husband did not like the chicken tenders much, my daughter said the ribs were OK, and my son said the burger was OK (but he adores bacon burgers, so he'd eat it no matter what). The service was very slow, although friendly. We did have to ask about our order after 40 minutes, and then were told that they were just waiting on one thing (while the other plates sat under the warmer)... The manager came over and apologized, but made no attempt to offer any reparation, discount, or comp a beverage or dessert. So we are left feeling frustrated and hungry. One last thing, the bathrooms are extremely messy, one clogged toilet, and no toilet paper in 2/3 stalls. It was just a bit gross, honestly. It was just such a poor dining experience...

After 15 minutes of waiting for the waiter to come around we gave up and asked the hostess.  The hostess is the only one who does her job.

He had sweet tea, the waiter brought regular. ***final update*** Food took 40 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager, this while my drink sat empty. I explained the various issues we had. She basically just looked down and never apologized. When the food came out, my daughter's ribs were cool, not even warm. My sour cream on my quesadillas was warm. Sour cream should be cold.  The actual manager, Juan, did come out after I asked for the check. I do feel he was genuine in his apology for the awful experience we had here tonight. I appreciate he took the time to apologize.

Long story short, my brother was about to take a huge bite into the sand which until he realized how hard it was. He removed the bun and there was a Half thawed RAW chicken cutlet. It was the most disgusting, despicable thing I have ever seen at a restaurant. The best the manager could do was comp the sandwich.

Our server was very nice and the food came out quickly. Okay now for the cons. The music. I get what they're going for with the music but it was very loud. My husband and I were literally yelling back and forth just to be able hear each other. No wonder the group seated behind us was also yelling. The food was okay. My margarita was weak, probably could've used the alcohol to make the meal taste better. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos. They were cold and the shrimp were so tiny! It came with more slaw than anything else. I also can't stand the yucky rice and beans that come with any ""Tex-Mex"" entree. My husband didn't really appear to enjoy his either.
