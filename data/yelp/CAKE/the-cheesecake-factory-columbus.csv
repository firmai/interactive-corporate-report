Jayme H.,"Columbus, OH",1260,130,381,4.0,1/10/2018,"Whenever I think of The Cheesecake Factory I picture Oprah Winfrey singing lyrics to Drake's song Childplay (""This is a place for families that drive Camries and go to Disney"") while slicing pieces of cheesecake for her guests. I have no clue why I picture this in my head, but it does sorta set a stage for what I expect when I plan to visit. It's a very family friendly establishment, it can be rather lavish, and it's pretty much what folks are deeming ""basic"" these days.  Now basic isn't necessarily a bad thing. To me is just means, common or popular.  This specific location of The Cheesecake Factory is right in the middle of Easton shopping center. This means there's a lot of parking surrounding it but depends on the time of year, day, etc. you may have to walk a bit. When you're walking in to give your name to the host, you'll notice a great patio! I always choose to sit outside if the weather is nice. This spot also has a good sized bar and an enormous dining area. It honestly feels never ending. This is a good thing considering how busy this location is. It always seems like there's a line out the door however I never seem to have to wait very long before I'm being taken back to a table.  I feel like the last several times I've visited I've gotten the same waitress. She is a total sweetheart and has definitely been working there for a while. She's always quick to greet the table, take drink orders, bring out bread, and she regularly checks in to make sure everything is going well. Speaking of bread, I love that they always bring out warm, freshly baked bread. Usually sourdough and honey wheat, both fantastic, especially when you're starving! I don't have a go-to menu item when I visit. I tend to try something new each time. I can confidently say that the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad is delicious! Big thumbs up! It comes tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and it's very refreshing! I also enjoy the Greek salad on the small plate menu, the avocado eggrolls on the appetizer menu, and the pastas are tasty and filling (the portions feel huge). Now, when it comes to down the actual cheesecake, I could go on and on forever. Every single one I've had has been amazing. The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is absolutely heavenly. I take a bite and it's pretty close to an outta body experience - no lie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is also a top choice. I love the crunch of the nuts. It gives it some much-needed texture.  Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is the food and the service has always been pretty good here. Its consistent and consistent is nice and comforting. It's why people visit the same restaurants over and over again. That's likely why I keep coming back to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm hungry and it's near by. While the majority of the time I dine out, I go local, I can make an exception to that rule every now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59,4.0,12/28/2017,"I've always been a fan and probably always will be. I hate waiting to be seated at restaurants and this one is one of the worst. It's so hard to get into 75% of the time.  Their menu is massive. Like ginormous. I've tried several things on the menu, but my go to is always the pasta davinci. The portions are rather large and a to go box is usually necessary. Their appetizers are all good too. Most recently tried the Nashville hot chicken bites and enjoyed those.  I love that ordering dessert here is the norm and is expected. I don't feel like others are judging me as much for being a pig at this restaurant. Sometimes my hubs and l will get a piece of cheesecake for the table and a piece to go for the next day. Everything I've had here has been solid and the service is always okay. Nothing exceptional, but not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Tom H.,"Westerville, OH",118,301,1994,3.0,11/21/2017,"Were you thinking about indulging in a slice of cheesecake while in the area? We were. Just carryout 2 slices. This does not reflect the full menu or dining room. It's the visual mecca of cheesecakes. Bright lighted cases to showcase their delights. A bustling of staff behind the counter, as well as staff from the dining room. They also come to this same area to fill their tables orders for dessert. If I was at a table, I would appreciate my servers aggressive nature of getting my order filled promptly. As a customer who is browsing the case, and ordering, I did not. The personal contact jostling unnecessarily. The loud verbose banter amongst staff about guests. Distracting the cashier taking our order. All things that should be worked on by the front of the house manger. Opening them up at home a short time later, My wife's first comment was, ""Why is yours bigger"". The answer to always remember is ""DIMENSIONS"". CF has their very own cheesecake carryout container. Slices may not be wider or taller than the container.  Her cheesecake was shorter because it was adorned with pretty decorations of treats. The taller the chimney, the lower the roof. This is not the very best cheesecake around. It's as good as most, and is top of the ladder in variety. I have found a food truck that somehow manages to make theirs so smooth and creamy, with a delicate firmness. Toppings vary by day, or specific to custom orders. Now I am forbidden to share the name here, but know that they have the best Sweet Cheese. I'm quite sure many comment on the price. $8/slice Nov 2017 is steep. Especially for average. If you think my review is not accurate, than I am ecstatic that you love your cheesecake experience.  Keep in mind that you can only hold a review to the standards you have experienced, not expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Liz A.,"Columbus, OH",52,41,24,5.0,11/11/2017,"Crazy busy place - but it was an AMAZING meal!  We thought going at 5 pm would beat the crowd - but we were wrong.  Not sure if there were lots out for dinner before a movie or eating after early holiday shopping - or perhaps off school/work for Veterans Day (on a Friday).  Regardless, we think they said it would be a 10 minute wait - and it was eleven.  Not bad, but lobby was crowded as it was SO COLD out that night. We got a nice 2-seater table away for any window - good so we could warm up.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive.  Overall, they did a good job keeping our drinks filled (we got a different waitress half way through our time there - weird.)   Hubby ordered the chicken chipotle pasta dish.  He had ordered it before and remembered it being good.  This meal lived up to his recollection and was very good (EMPTY PLATER). I ordered the Skinnylicious chopped chicken salad dish - dressing on the side.  I think I got what I ordered (no dressing - ever.  but it was fine without).  I question whether it was actually a Skinnylicious under 590 calorie dish as it was SO GOOD.  There was plenty of flavorful bacon and crumbled bleu cheese, as well as chicken, avocado and corn.  It was a huge serving.  I just have trouble believing it was Skinnylicious.  Regardless, I ate EVERY SINGLE BITE OF IT!  I posted a photo - check it out.  You can see al the cheese and the pile of shredded greens. The only very  minor complaint (although it's more of a strong comment) - was the food seemed to take a while to come out.  Granted we had fresh bread to snack on - so we weren't dying of hunger.  Also, we really weren't in a hurry to go back out in the cold to trek back to the garage for our car. I have to remember how much I love the salad so we return more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
April S.,"Westerville, OH",200,189,657,3.0,11/10/2017,"I haven't been here in probably 10 years. Located in the heart of Easton Towne Center. Parking at parking lots located on both sides or street parking with meters. Casual ambience. Warning.. it's very dark in the restaurant. Guess it's supposed to help create the mood but i wear super thick glasses and it made me feel blind. They give you bread before the meal, i would have thought it would come out warm but it didnt. Was very hard to spread the butter. I did appreciate the honey wheat bread though. Food didnt take too long. Our waiter was good and gave us a wide range of selections of his preferences. I ordered a chicken dish that was breaded chicken in a lemon sauce with sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus..the chicken was really good. The dish was only $17ish and it was so much food, made it into two meals...lunch for the next day.  The menu has a wide variety from seafood, to chicken, to pastas, to steaks and sandwiches. They also offer a skinny meal with a pretty good selection with minimized calories. Looking forward to a return visit to try something else. Not sure why it's taken me 10 years to return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Blaire W.,"Columbus, OH",11,13,16,3.0,11/4/2017,"I've been to this location a few times before for lunch and dinner. This time I went for brunch with 4 other people. We all got something different and I got the eggs Benedict with the potatoes and a side of fruit. Pretty standard.  We ordered coffee and I also asked for a water. I didn't get the water until I asked 2 more times toward the end of the meal. I had to ask twice for sweetener. This was frustrating because it took our server a long time to come back.  My food arrived before everyone else's by several minutes. Each persons dish arrived a few minutes after the next, except the breakfast combo. That came about 5 minutes after the 4th meal arrived. A waffle, two scrambled eggs and bacon was the last to arrive. At least it was hot when it came. So if you plan to eat together, good luck because not everyone will get their food together.  My meal was pretty good. Still warm by the time we all had our food. It was pretty standard Benedict. Nothing to write home about.  One friend got the eggs, toast and bacon and they forgot the bacon. The friend with the waffle had to send it back because it was borderline over cooked. Another friend got the brioche breakfast sandwich and the last friend got the monte cristo. Both sandwiches looked sloppy and haphazard. The monte cristo was not a typical monte cristo, not what you normally would think of and she wasn't pleased with it.  $3.25 for standard drip coffee and a breakfast I can get at the corner spot in a suburb would have been better. You're definitely paying for the name when you come here. I prefer Cheesecake Factory for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Randy G.,"Alto, MI",10,106,30,4.0,8/7/2017,Try the Jamaican shrimp I always like Caribbean food and they did a nice job with it. I'm not a big fan of national chains like this but always enjoy the food if it's prepared to the quality that they execute. Service was also very good and we barely had to wait for anything.  At the end of the meal our table ordered three pieces of Cheesecake to try out which was the best. The red velvet won for our table against the tiramasu and some other chocolatey chocolate cake.  I'd recommend the place if your in a bind for a food place to try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Scott H.,"Groveport, OH",2,6,,5.0,12/11/2017,"This place rocks in being able to eat very well (healthy) and the environment is great!  If cheesecake is your gig then you have a ton of choices!   We split a huge salad , an appetizer, and fillet mignon!    Totally great!   Wait staff is amazing!   Will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",1391,247,1105,5.0,10/12/2016,"Stopped in Sunday afternoon about 1:00.  This place is busy!  We put our name down and waited about 30 min for our pager to buzz.  We were seated and promptly attended to.  Our drink order was taken and some time was given to review the 30 page menu.  The menu is overwhelming but if you break it down and go directly for the pages that are of interest then you only have about 2-4 pages to look at.  It's even easier if you decided between dinner or sandwiches.  We chose sandwiches, and the sandwiches that we chose were delicious.  We have eaten here before and had items off the dinner menu.   The Cheesecake Factory is pretty expensive but the quality of the meal is worth the price that you pay. The sandwiches are around $14 and the meals are around $20.   Our server was fun and attentive. He brought out our drinks and fresh bread. We placed our order, and our sandwiches were brought out in a good amount of time.   Our service was great, and the food was fabulous.  We shared a  1/2 sandwich with each other so we could try them both out, but we only ended up eating  1/2 of our own sandwich as we were full.  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and French fries and mentioned how tasty and fresh the ingredients were and the crispiness of the French fries.   We did not order any dessert this time but have in the past.  The cheesecake is fantastic and I highly recommend ordering a piece.    Order:   CUBAN SANDWICH $13.95 Slow Roasted Pork, Ham, Swiss cheese, Pickles, Mustard and Mayonnaise on a Grilled and Pressed Roll. Served with French Fries or Green Salad.

Our wit for bread was 40 minutes.  With 4 very hungry kids that was ridiculous.  Our server said he would bring it in 2-3 minutes after ordering.  I finally went by the kitchen to ask for crackers and the server said they didn't have crackers, but she would get me some bread!  So very frustrating for something patrons expect quickly at this restaurant.   The restaurant has great food and amazing cheesecake but I don't recommend going at busy times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus

Huge, always busy, always loud.  But, good food, huge slices of an endless variety of cheesecakes, and good service.  This time we just stopped in for cheesecake.  So busy that literally getting us two slices took 10 minutes.  Rich, huge slices, in pretty much any flavor you can think of. When we come for dinner, Sweetie usually gets a steak and salmon combo, and loves it.  I get something spicy- shrimp, jambalaya, etc.  Always good, and plenty for leftovers.  It is expensive, but the quality and quantity make that worth it.  We'll see how things go with a baby for dining in sometime soon.   Try to come at off hours (still busy, just not crazy.)  Prepare to wait, regardless.  Pick something from the huge menu.  And have some cheesecake, to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus
Carolyn T.,"Groveport, OH",4,14,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Yesterday we made the poor decision to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. We were with extended family so neither my husband nor I spoke up about the quality of our food. I ordered Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs.  By the time I got my order the food was cold. The tortilla chips were soggy. It was very unappetizing. My husband ordered the Brunch Combo which is eggs, bacon, and pancakes. He told me his food was cold, as well. I realize that some of the fault lies with us for not speaking up. I did not want to embarrass the others in our party by saying anything.

Michele W.,"Columbus, OH",2,73,,2.0,4/1/2017,"Caveat - I've been to the Cheesecake Factory twice before many years ago when I lived in a different state.  Was not impressed AT ALL then.  Because of that I never go there.  The only reason why I went there recently is because I wanted a salad for lunch & I was trying to find places around where I work that had good salads.  A friend suggested the Cheesecake Factory, as large as their menu is, I knew they would probably have a salad that I may like. Ordered the anti-oxidant salad, here is the description:  A Delicious Blend of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette. Sounds appetizing right???  NOT.  This was basically a blend of salad greens.  I requested no avocado or almonds.  There were NO blueberries at all.  There were all of 8 grapes cut in half, the roasted pear was diced so tiny that as I was eating I remembered it was supposed to have pear and I had to dig for these miniscule pieces that basically added no flavor to all that kale and spinach.  There was also no broccoli in the salad!  The ONLY good thing was the dressing.  If I'd wanted a kale & spinach salad I would've ordered that!   Anyone whose ever been to the Cheesecake Factory knows they give large portion.  So I had this huge takeout of basically spinach & kale with a few sunflower seeds, grapes & diced pears with fabulous dressing.  Once AGAIN - I will not go to the cheesecake factory for the next 30 years.  Maybe they will improve by then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus

We've been here several times in the last two years, because it is closer than that Polaris location, and everyone we say we won't come back. We mean it this time. We don't mind waiting to be seated. That's to be expected. But the quality of service here is despicable. Yes, it's that bad. Maybe it is a hiring issue. A training issue. I have no idea. I get better service at Applebee's or any other cheaper restaurant than at this location. And for the prices here...they should be ashamed. I'll go to Polaris from here out...totally worth the extra 20 minute or so drive. What a shame!

Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373,4.0,5/23/2016,"This poor girl has been on a ""healthy-living journey"" for a year and a half now (I've lost 200 pounds!) so when my birthday rolled around this year, I wanted to be REAL bad. So of course I picked the Cheesecake Factory, America's biggest guilty pleasure.  We went on a Friday at about 2:00pm since this location gets crazy packed on Saturday and Sunday and we quickly got a table for 2. Since I knew I was going to eat a slice of cheesecake with an entire days worth of calories and fat grams, we decided to order the chicken samosas appetizer from the Skinnylicious menu. They were amazing! Full of spiced meat and lightly fried but not dripping in grease. The dipping sauce was great too, so we were very pleased with this low-calorie app.  For my meal I ordered the sausage & ricotta flatbread also from the Skinnylicious menu, and my husband had the Cuban sandwich. When they delivered our meals I'm not gonna lie: I was totally jealous of the huge, crusty sandwich my husband received. It looked so unbelievably good! He said it was delicious even though he prefers softer bread (I like it firm and crusty so this looked perfect to me). My flatbread was listed as a small plate and it definitely was small, but it was pretty awesome. The sausage was finely ground and tasted great and the ricotta and kale combo was so tasty. A small dish that packed a ton of flavor, so I was a happy girl. Now, the REAL reason we visited this place...the cheesecake. I had the Oreo dream extreme (covered in thick chocolate and full of soft Oreo bits - EXACTLY what I was craving!) and my husband had the vanilla bean (sounded boring but tasted like the most delicious, whippy scoop of vanilla bean ice cream ever). Both slices were huge and literally too good to put into words.

Our biggest problem wasn't the food but was the location of our table.  We were sandwiched in between two tables of people and there was zero privacy.  When the waitress would wait on either of the tables to the left or right of us, her butt was way too close to me - very uncomfortable.  The second issue was the noise level.  I hate being stressed out when I'm eating.  I'm stressed out enough at my job and don't have the desire to deal with more stress when I'm trying to relax in my limited time off.  Those sliders were damn good, but I don't think I could go through that again.  Maybe next time I'll have a glass of wine before we go so I won't be so stressed.  Do people actually like eating in this type of environment?  I certainly don't get it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=60

After waiting an hour to get seated (no big deal,they were super busy) we had what may be the worst service I've received by Adalina. We ordered appetizers and our meals which were both delivered quickly by the food runners. Our waitress was at our table only when taking our order, when the food was delivered, and when we finally flagged her down 20 minutes after everyone was done eating. One of the guests at our table went his entire meal without anything to drink. We told her he never got his second beer (he had ordered when the food arrived)to which she responded ""Oh okay"" and then proceeded to inform us she had been taking care of a tables order with a food allergy. Apparently it's ok to neglect your other tables if someone is allergic to something. Everyone had planned to order cheesecake but chose not to considering how long it took for Adalina to return to her tables.

The place was not busy and we saw that only a few people were outside eating. We decided to ask for outside seating. Even though there were seats galore inside and out, we were told that there would be a 15 minute wait no matter what area we chose. There were a few people ahead of us and were being called.  While waiting, we looked outside and felt like it might rain so we approached the desk to tell them that we would like to change to an inside table.  At that time we were told that our name had already been called. There was absolutely no way we had been called since we had not left the area. Since we had supposedly missed our call, the lady told us that we would then be ""put back into the rotation."" We didn't know what that meant, but soon found out. The next name called was that of a couple who came after us. The next name was another couple after us. We got the idea.  At that point we decided that a table for us could not be found and that our business was not desired.  We got up to walk out and once they saw us leaving, they quickly called our name, but we continued to walk out.  We took a short walk to PF Changs, walked directly in, was immediately waited on and had a great meal.

Sarah P.,"Columbus, OH",62,313,11,5.0,7/23/2014,"One of my all time favorite restaurants!  I am 100% in love with the Cheesecake Factory, and I am NOT afraid to admit it. 1st up:  APPETIZERS  YAY!!, Ok, so I have only had 1 of their appetizers, but after tasting their chicken quesadilla why would I ever get anything else???  I have been to several Mexican restaurants and have NEVER had one as good as this.  I have even tried to duplicate it at home (to no avail) it's so good.   Next up:  Main Courses!!  Chicken & Biscuits.  So good, so so good.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the super moist chicken, sweet carrots, flaky biscuits and unique gravy.  This dish makes my taste buds sing. This is definitely my favorite entree-period. I have also had their Chicken & Avocado sandwich that comes with french fries.  This sandwich, my friends, is super tasty.  When I first ordered this I was slightly leary of the combination, but don't be hesitant like I was.  Jump into it full force because it is the shiznit. My husband gets their shrimp bistro pasta.  He says it has a great flavor to it and he orders this every time we go.  I CANNOT vouch for this because I will NEVER taste it, because as most of you know you eat with your eyes first and something about this dish just appears unappealing to me and I refuse to put a bite of it anywhere near my mouth.  Sorry, I'm just weird like that. I have tasted their pizza, it's mighty good too.  My kids have gotten their chicken fingers on MANY occasions, and they always gobble them up with a quickness. Their brown bread is soft, and just plain good.  We always ask for all brown bread when we go here because we are not big fans of the harder sourdough bread (they can keep that stuff). Now to my favorite part. What they are known best for...CHEESECAKE!  I have tried so many I don't even know where to start.  I will tell you my absolute favorite is the lemon raspberry one.  It is so light and fluffy and not as heavy as most of the other flavors.  Others I have tried that are fabulous as well are,  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Ultimate Red Velvet, Oreo (the regular one is good, the chocolate oreo one is gross--tell them no thank you on that one), Chocolate Tuxedo (yuk--avoid this one too), White Chocolate Blueberry, Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, and I am sure there are many other.  All of the cheesecakes I have tasted (other than the ones listed with bad comments beside them) and been wonderful. I would recommend this spot for a friends night out or a family outing.  Either way, you will get good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=60

I love very rich decadent chocolate...the ""crust"" or whatever was what I believe to be dark chocolate and the middle part like a chocolate mousse (it is flourless), also with a chocolate wafer square on top of it!  It was so rich that my daughter and I had to get a box and there was still 1/4 left which we shared the next day, lol.  My other daughter and her boyfriend ordered the tuxedo cheesecake which they very much enjoyed.  It was my older daughter's birthday so I told the server then about five or six wait staff came out and sang happy birthday with her cheesecake decorated with some sprinkles and a candle in the whipped cream, a very nice festive touch!

Their menu is huge, and it's almost as if they are trying to cater to whatever you have a craving for. This makes it a bit hard to choose what you want. I ordered the Shepard's pie - and it was... eh. I have never had Shepard's pie before, but I would definitely say that it's not very authentic. It seemed like it was something that they had thrown together in the kitchen, and topped with Mashed potatoes. The Potatoes were fine, but I wasn't too keen on eating the rest of it.  The waitstaff was pretty good, considering we arrived a half hour before close. The food took a bit longer to come out, and it was whatever for us. The Cheesecake is amazing though!

The manager then told us he would give us a piece of cheesecake on the house.  We also had a plate of macaroni and cheese which I must say was the best Mac n cheese I've ever had in my life.

Later I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes to split with my daughter and another kids' French toast. When the food came 30 minutes later we noticed the food tasted like coffee. Both of the small metal carafes that were supposed to be filled with syrup were filled with black coffee instead! Needless to say both of our meals were ruined when we poured coffee over our food. When I told the waiter about the problem he said that I ordered it that way. What??? I have never even heard of pouring coffee over lemon pancakes let alone ordering coffee to pour over my 11 year old's French toast.

I left work early to pick it up and it wasn't ready- which ended up being fine since they had extra in the back. I also ordered a chocolate block on the side to read ""happy birthday brian"". I kid you not it took the red headed baker 30 minutes to write on it. She had one that would have been fine. It was sloppy but I would have taken it. But no, she wiped the writing off and started over. I only put 20 minutes in my meter thinking I'd be in and out to pick up my order. So I told them I had to pay my meter and I'd be back. I came back and she was starting over on a whole new chocolate block. I mean come on. So I waited another 10 minutes and then said ""look forget about the chocolate block"". Took my cake and left. I'm pretty upset actually. I paid for that block and tipped the bakers before any of this and I 100% regret it.

So against our better judgement, we signed up for a large group dinner at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations. Knowing that there will be a wait, we arrived well ahead of the group at 4:30 to put our name in for our 12-person table. We were advised that a large group had just sat down at 4:30 so that it will be a 2 hour wait. Apparently they designate one specific set of seats at this restaurant for large groups, so we had the wait for the group before us to leave.  Never mind that this is a huge restaurant and could have placed us elsewhere if they'd actually tried. We literally saw over a 100 people seated before us after all. Unfortunately for us, the large group that they allowed to seat before us at the only table we were allowed to sit at was not a complete party, and it apparently took them an hour to even order since not everyone had arrived when they seated this group ahead of us.  So we waited and waited and waited. For 3 hours in the end. It could've been 2.5 hrs but they didn't want to hurry the group occupying our table apparently... Which is fair except the birthday girl went to check on our table and found 2 out of 12 table remaining, just texting on their phones. I know you don't kick people out of their seats at a restaurant usually, but come on! The manager comped us some appetizers, which was nice of him.

I had this issue with this place. I LOVE this place but this location wasn't as good as what I remember back east. The wait at 6pm was an hour and half so we walked over to barnes and noble and browsed, which is always nice for a mall restaurant... there's distractions. When our names were called we noticed the wait went up to 3 hours. THAT IS NUTS!!! I don't care how good the cheesecake is, 3 hours is NUTS!!  So we get in at about 7:30 and our waitress took a considerable amount of time to get to us and was in a rush the whole night, often forgetting we asked for things like napkins or more bread. She needed a break to say the least....badly! The bread that was on the table was stale; like 2 days ago type stale. For an app we all shared the buffalo blasts (Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing) which was tasty... a lot tastier then I thought they would be. The dipping sauce was bad though. They didn't go together at all.  I ordered the chicken romano (Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta w/ Tomato Sauce.)  It was 2 flattened pieces of dried out chicken with panko bread crumbs (tasted no cheese) with a huge (like 4 servings) of pasta with a creamy red sauce. The sauce was good but there was barely any at all on the pasta and the chicken was drier then a boot so I asked for more sauce not wanting to send the food back; it took long enough to get to us the first time. The hubby got some kind of pasta and had the same issue I did; didn't realize what he was ordering and it came out dry and without much sauce. We both asked for more sauce which came out quick.  Dad got a salad which was large, but not enough food for a man in his eyes. He didn't say much else about it apart from complaining about prices for bad food. My mom order mac and cheese, which came out deep fried. She was horrified by the calories but her face showed she was in heaven.  The reason we go back is the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cheese cake this time. My favorite so far, although their blueberry cheese cake is so heavenly that I may have two favorites. Then again, every new flavor I try ends up being my new favorite so oh well. Mom got a huge piece of carrot cake and dam near licked the plate clean.

Neal W.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",158,139,26,2.0,7/27/2013,"Here are the top six things you should know before visiting The Cheesecake Factory in Easton (or any Cheesecake Factory, really): 1.) This place is always seems to be pretty busy, but I can't seem to understand why. My excuse was that I had a gift certificate, but I imagine most people are choosing to send their dining dollars to Cheesecake Factory over one of the local great restaurants they could discover through Yelp. 2.) They're obviously known for their large portions, and the food is actually pretty good, but everything tastes good when it's made with two sticks of butter and topped with cheddar cheese. The menu is also very large, which would be good if you're with a bunch of picky eaters, but it was honestly a bit overwhelming and hard to figure out which items would be the best choices. 3.) The decor in this place seems to be having some identity issues. There seemed to be Mediterranean, Egyptian, Italian, French, and possibly Jersey Shore influence in the design. Again, it seems like they're trying to have as many concepts as possible to please everyone, but it just comes off strange and identity-less. 4.) The prices are a little high, but I guess many find comfort knowing that they are going to get a decent meal and plenty of leftovers. 5.) The service is pretty good. No complaints from my visit.  6.) By the end of our meal we were stuffed, but since it's The Cheesecake Factory, we felt obligated to get a slice (plus cheesecake is delicious). We got a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake to go and it tasted great. For being called The Cheesecake Factory, that does seem to be where their strength is. If I had a craving I could see myself stopping back in to get a slice, but I wouldn't come back for the rest of the menu. Got your six, Neal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=140

It came out and the shrimp weren't cleaned properly, and the sauce was like water. It was ridiculous. I know it was Sunday afternoon. I realize that we were seated during a shift change.

But it's one of those breakups, where we still run into each other now and then.  Inevitably someone from back home will be coming to Columbus and insist we eat there and I'll smile and agree, and enjoy the complimentary bread, which is really quite good, but then I'll take one look at the menu and remember why the Cheesecake Factory and I are no longer on speaking terms. For such a long menu, they have very little that appeals to me.  I eat meat, but only when I'm sure of the quality, and since I'm not sure of it at CF that leaves me with the veggie options, and the veggie options get no love from me.

Kenneth H.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2014,"I've eaten at cheesecake factory many times over the years and this restaurant about 6.    I have to say this was by far the worst service I have ever had at ccf.   The server seemed annoyed by us from the start.   The restaurant wasn't that busy even though it is close to Christmas. We were there at an off peak time.    Our food arrived at a reasonable time except for one meal.   It took another 7 minutes for the last meal to arrive. I swear they must have dropped it or forgot it (it was the lunch portion of the full meal I had. Go figure!). We all tried to be polite and wait but our food was getting cold.  Once the food arrived our server disappeared.  We asked a different server for more bread but ccf must be on a cost cutting program.   It never arrived.   When our server finally came back we asked for more bread again.   She repeated the request, asking in an incredulous tone, ""MORE bread? "", like we couldn't possibly need more. On to desert.   It is, after all, the reason you go there. The cheesecake was solid and did not disappoint. Cost cutting is going on with the cheesecake as well. No longer are the portions overflowing the plate! Normal portions! Price is the same, however.   And, note to staff, unless you plan to eat it with your fingers one needs a fork.   We had none.   A fact the server could have noted when she cleaned our plates.  So being the patient customer I am, I asked for forks.   She said she'd go find some and brought back 2.  Only 1 problem, there were 5 of us! So I sent her scurrying off in a huff for 3 more.  Needles to say her tip reflected her level of poor service.

Ally T.,"Blacklick, OH",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2016,"I have eaten at this easton cheesecake factory many times- and each time we had great service until last night. I have been a server for the past 5 years, so I know when another server says the same B.S lines to me and I know they messed up. I understand that mistakes happen, things in the kitchen can get crazy, people run food they weren't suppose to.  i get it. But our server never apologized during the meal and neither did management.  it took almost 10 minutes- once again if she would have apologized in her greet ""thank you so much for your patience this evening I'm Tianna""- i get it. full section. running around. nothing.  It took quiet awhile after that to receive our drinks...1 ice water and 3 unsweetened ice teas.  *do the servers/management at cheesecake factory not help one another when they are slammed?*  when she finally came back to us we gave her our full order- apps and all.  this is where the service and management failed.  Our appetizers never came because our entree's came out first. two other servers ran our dinner out in which we asked what happened to our appetizers. They were being plated. Our server didn't come over to say ""I am so sorry!"" nadda. The manager who I assume was running the line that evening came over right when our food was dropped off to inform us that our appetizers were coming out, in which we said no. we had our dinner. no thanks. He honestly didn't looked surprised that she messed up. But no apology just a ""I'll take those off the check for you"" and walked away.  we were half way done with our meal when our server came back to see how everything was tasting-no mention of the appetizers mix up. dropped off the bread that we had asked for when we ordered our food over 20 minutes prior....filled up drinks and walked away and didn't come back until we boxed up our food.  we all ordered a cheesecake, my boyfriend a cup of coffee. My friends across from me said ""yes, two pumpkin cheesecakes because we don't share""- she misunderstood, this I wasn't as mad because I once again understand that it's loud and the other cheesecake came out somewhat quicker *I understand you have to rush the order* - since only three cheesecakes came out not 4. but my boyfriend never got his coffee. no apology.  so we paid and hung out in the booth- we were actually ok with how everything happened for our meals. we haven't see each other and it was actually my friends taking me and my boyfriend out as my boyfriends belated birthday present to us from them. well needless to say... I caught our server and another server at a terminal staring at us- I can only speculate that they were sh** talking us because she saw her 10% tip, but they made it pretty obvious, my jaw dropped. Go to the back ladies.  Our server did apologize once though- at the end after we paid about the appetizers but it wasn't sincere, quick, and she promptly walked away.  I was just going to write this off as one bad trip, as I've gone before and my service was great- I wasn't going to write a review but the last straw was when our server came back to us to ask us why she received such a bad tip..which is that cheesecake factory policy? because...it should have been obvious- well my friend that paid went on to explain why she received a bad tip- about how the appetizers, the coffee- she tried to say she can't control when the food comes out- which is somewhat true-but in this circumstance no. I don't know if you use micros or aloha but any server knows not to put appetizers and pasta in at the same time- as most places you have the pasta pre-cooked so all you have to do is deep fry the chicken, toss in the sauce and plate them- so yeah they cook way faster than all of the appetizers we ordered. She either put them in at the same time or  way too close to one another- like she rang them in less then five minutes later. Management never came back either to check on us. honestly we could have solved this problem if management would have been better and expressed ANY apologies but none. I hope next time I go back this issues will be resolved with service and management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=80
Curt P.,"Spokane, WA",3,15,1,5.0,9/23/2014,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for years. I have never had a bad experience and I've been to several in multiple states. I don't care that the menu gives War and Peace a run for it's money, I don't care that one meal likely meets a weeks worth of calories, and I definitely don't care that it's a chain. The phrase jack of all trades master of none does not apply to Cheesecake Factory because everything they do, they do well. From appetizer to dessert it is can't miss. AND THE PORTIONS ARE SO LARGE THEY DESERVE A SENTENCE IN ALL CAPS.  The chicken madiera is one of their most popular dishes and if you try it you will see why. My favorite menu item has actually been of the menu for years, but as sad as that is, I can always drown out the memory with an appetizer, entree and dessert. And of course, cheesecakes are their namesake, and the have about a billion to choose from. But seriously, the list is 50+ cheesecakes of which I've probably had between 10-15. My favorite is the Red Velvet and it is not so rich that I can't eat it in a single sitting. Some cheesecakes, like the Godiva or Tuxedo are too rich not to be spread out over the next day or so. The Linda's Fudge Cake is always a good choice if you opt not to go the cheesecake route. The one downside is that this place is always packed during peak hours but it is worth the wait.

Cheryl H.,"Columbus, OH",984,288,101,4.0,3/14/2010,"I felt morally obligated to update this review because of a change in my diet. In my previous review, I described the world's most amazing sandwich, known as the Navajo. -  Warm, crunchy fry bread. Perfectly ripened avocado. Grilled chicken. Lettuce. Tomato. Herb mayo. Served with amazing french fries, and the most incredibly rich ranch dressing to dunk them in. Well... I don't eat MEAT anymore, so when I was at Cheesecake Factory the other day, it physically pained me to know that I couldn't eat this sandwich. I made a last-minute decision when the waitress arrived back at our table - I asked for the Navajo, with no chicken, and added swiss cheese and mushrooms (and the obligatory side of ranch.) She only hesitated for a fraction of a second at me ordering a chicken sandwich sans chicken, then smiled and said ""Of course!""  When my Navajo came out, it was PACKED with veggies so that it was just as fulfilling as if it had chicken.

Barry S.,"Columbus, OH",1,14,,3.0,6/3/2010,"I've eaten in house a few times, but mostly takeout.. just for the reason that it was so packed that I didn't want to wait 2 hours for a table. This is just one of those restaurants that reviews really don't matter because people will go there anyway..  They'll go just for the sake of going because it's the Cheesecake Factory.  There's nothing wrong with that- CF has built such a reputation that they have become ""review-proof"" in a way.  The service is decent, but it's clearly obvious that the servers make their money on quantity, not quality- a direct opposition from the Fish Market.. CF service has the turn em and burn em approach and it's sad.

Dennis L.,"Columbus, OH",29,184,,3.0,7/29/2010,"Why is this restaurant always crowded?  I'm having difficulty thinking of a time I ate here or even walked past when the lobby wasn't packed shoulder-to-shoulder with people, spilling out onto the patio.  Sometimes you even have to get on a waiting list for a beeper!  People wait hours to eat here.  I don't get it.  I mean, the food is quite good, much better than average for a national chain, but it's not THAT good.  And waiting in that lobby is stressful.  There's a constant stream of servers running back and forth from the dining room to the case the holds the cheesecake, and there are very few places to sit.  They need to have a dedicated waiting room here, like a doctor's office. I also hate the portion sizes here.  When you get a ""lunch-sized"" salad for your meal, and you eat until you're stuffed and the bowl is still three-quarters full, it's too much.  The serving sizes are big at many chain restaurants, but here they're out of control.  It's like the poster child for American gluttony. All that said, the food here really is quite good.  With a name like Cheesecake Factory, your cheesecake better be awesome, and it is (you ever wonder why almost nothing at Olive Garden contains olives?).  I always settle on the banana cream, and it's good enough to daydream about.  As for entrees, I've never had anything I disliked.  The best thing I've ever had here is the pizza with goat cheese and roasted veggies.  It's very, very rare I order vegetarian dishes, but the description was so mouth-watering, I had to try it.  I don't know if they still serve cole slaw, but I hope so, because it's the only restaurant cole slaw I've ever liked in my life... made with crisp, fresh cabbage and a light dressing.

Simone D.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,55,12,2.0,3/29/2011,"So my reason for going to Cheesecake Factory was because I needed a kid friendly restaurant. I knew that they had a kids menu so I was thrilled to go here and then shop afterwards. I'm a fan of the huge menu they have. There are so many options. The strawberry lemonade I had, was amazing. That's where my good experience ended for the most part.  I ordered the grilled chicken and fries for my 4 year old. I couldn't decide what I wanted so the rest of my party(3 others) ordered first and then about 10 minutes later I put in my order. First off when we were going over the menu I was asking the waitress what was good. She had said something was good but she compared it to chicken parmesan and I made it very clear that I didn't like chicken parmesan. So I asked her between two other things on the menu. She told me to go with the Chicken Bellagio I believe it was. Now I could be wrong but when I looked at the menu I didn't gather it was going to be exactly like chicken parmesan with a different sauce. So the fact that I stated I didn't like that and then she offered it, she wasn't paying too close attention. I'm not sure if she was interested in getting us in and out because she made the comment that she was almost off work so she was anxious which makes me uneasy because I feel like I'm intruding almost. Anyways, my order comes out first. I understand one order would come out quicker than 3, but if you have children you can understand that having your food come out and not theirs makes things difficult.  The other items come out. Back to the grilled chicken. It was under-cooked!! I couldn't believe it. I cut it all up and as I'm looking at it, it's PINK! As any parent could be surprised, I was floored. Especially to be at Cheesecake Factory and have a small mishap like that. I was thinking maybe it was my eyes, so I tasted it. I definitely had to use my napkin after the first taste because I could tell it was not fully cooked! I told my waitress and she apologized. Then the manager came by and apologized, put another piece of chicken on the grill for me. Then another manager came by and dropped the chicken off made sure it was okay. Offered me another meal for myself since he could tell I wasn't liking it, but I declined. My mother LOVES Cheesecake Factory so she appreciated the meal! They ended up taking the kids meal off the bill which was very nice but in the same sense, under-cooked chicken is unacceptable. So for the most part the staff was very friendly and helpful but they seemed ""too busy"" to really care. It was 3 PM when I went so they could have made their concern seem a little more genuine. Don't think I'll be going back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=160

I got the raspberry lemonade- which is possibly my favorite drink in the world- and it was never even close to being empty- plus the sugar sprinkled along the rim of the glass (which is part of the drink's appeal for me) was always there. The waitress was also very kind and friendly but NOT fake. 3) The food was awesome It was flavorful, delicious and piping hot (when appropriate). I left happily full. I'll rarely say no if someone suggests eating at the cheesecake factory.   4) Fast service I was there on a weekday afternoon and the place was fairly crowded with lunch-ers, yet everything came out to the table so quickly, the thought crossed my mind that maybe they had some wizards working back in the kitchen....

What this restaurant achieves superficially, it missed the mark in substance. Unfortunately, there isn't much about this place that would commend itself to those seeking an enjoyable night out - especially considering what you'll end up paying.  On the few occasions I've eaten here, it has always been exceedingly crowded regardless of the day. On my most recent visit, my wife and I were packed into a row of tables like sardines. We ended sitting elbow-to-elbow with a group of rambunctious, Australian muscle-heads who spent the evening bragging about their most recent DUIs. The whole restaurant was extremely loud (Australians notwithstanding) so much so that we could barely carry on a private conversation.  The food was overall very average. The offerings and quality are about what you might expect from TGI Fridays, just 50% more expensive. The service was okay, and the wait times were a bit longer than what you'd like. The only reason I bumped this review up to 3 stars was because of the cheesecake. In this realm, they certainly live up to their reputation.

We wanted outside so we could enjoy the beautiful weather and people watch the Easton Art Festival goers. We got exactly what we wanted. With an excellent waiter and cocktails to boot.  I had the chicken parm sandwich which was pretty tasty. The boyfriend had the luau salad which was massive and incredibly good. And, when I say massive, I meant it... it was 3 stories high. For drinks, I skipped the wine and went with J.W.'s pink lemonade which tasted exactly like pink lemonade despite being entirely alcohol.

Had either the food or service been better, they likely would have gotten 3 stars.  First issue, we waited more than 20 minutes for our appetizer. Then, our entrees came before we had finished the appetizer.  Our buffalo blasts appetizer was pretty good, but could have used a bit more spice. I had the ""spicy"" chicken tacos for my entree. It was not spicy, was pretty much tasteless and was dry. The biggest taste I got was from the tortilla, instead of everything in it.  Next issue was with the service. Our waitress was friendly and nice, but I think she had too many tables. We were both completely out of water. She stopped to check on the food and mentioned she would get more, but it never came.  The best part of the meal was the cheesecake. I got the pumpkin cheesecake, and it was delicious. We also finally got some more water- we asked for it when our cheesecake was delivered.

That still seems to be the case because the servers were performing off-key renditions of Happy Birthday about every 5 minutes. However, the quality of food and service was not what I remember. The food was bland and greasy. Our server seemed bored and was slow on food/drink delivery, despite the restaurant not being all that busy.

I have tried two salads and the turkey burger.  Everything was excellent which surprised me considering how low in calories and fat they all are.  I definitely recommend their skinny menu.

Either way, I had the cashew chicken with brown rice, extra spicy. The sauce was more toward sweet than spicy, but still good. If you like spicy food, I would recommend emphasizing that when you order. For an appetizer, we had the corn tamales. I would not really call them corn tamales. They were more like a sweet corn cake, but they were still good. Everyone at the table seemed pleased with what they ordered.  Now for the best part, the cheesecake. Order the cheesecake.

In fact, I wasn't pleased with the tiramisu taste this time. Change of recipe? Or have my tastebuds changed over the 2 years.

I like this restaurant because it's for everyone and I think everyone can find something they like. It may be a chain but it's a notch above and certainly not an Applebee's or a TGIFriday.

Here's what-buttermilk pancakes with ricotta cheese and lemon zest. Sounds so simple doesn't it? Is it Sunday yet? They're so light, fluffy, moist and ...refreshing? It's the lemon zest-so good.

I grew up loving this cake and when I tried CF's cheesecake version I just stared at it after one bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3081,6377,5213,4.0,5/29/2012,"For a chain restaurant I would give it 5 stars but overall a solid 4 stars. We hadn't been to Cheesecake Factory in years (last time in Beveryly Hills, CA) and didn't remember it being anything special. This time we had a gift card and were shopping at Easton and figured to give it another chance. We got there monday at 5 with minimal wait and once we saw the happy hour menu decided to sit at the bar. Service was very nice and super fast, we were on an out in an hour. The prices are steep for a chain restaurant, there was no way I was going to pay $25+ for some fish so once I saw they have a housemade veggie burger I had to give it a try. It was pretty good, not as good as Northstar or some others but descent. The house sald with ginger soy super yummy, best dressing ever! We got a bunch of $5 plates the guys favorite was the mac n cheese balls, the burger sliders were also pretty good, the chicken sliders ok but not much chicken, really more bread and breading than anything else. The tex mex egg rolls were fine, I loved the avocado spread with it. The chicken potstickers were also good. Portions for apps were pretty big, you get alot more than at any other restaurant we've been to and for $5 a good deal. I just can't jutify paying $7 for a slice of cake so I've yet to try that but I did stand there and drool for a few minutes....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100

Their vegetable salad is incredible, portions are huge. They have a skinny menu which is delicious. Cheesecake good, but rich. I can only eat a few bites and usually share with someone.

Gia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,63,2,1.0,12/31/2014,"I fucking love cake.  I will do a lot of shit for cake.  It's the only reason and the best part of braving polar temperatures and snow monsters, bearing hordes of white people who can neither parallel park nor be successful pedestrians (by successful, I mean, behaving in crosswalks in a way suggesting one chooses life), eventually just leaving your car wherever because ""officer, frankly, I am feeling rather handicapped, yes. Also, I've no loose change"", shoving your way past all the assholes who can find no other place to loiter in the restaurant lobby of the Cheesecake Factory but in the clearly marked ROPED OFF line for desserts and carryout, watching as a gainfully employed young black man slices a curiously small $10 piece of cake and proceeds to manhandle said piece like it's meatloaf, and you'll notice this started with ""the best part"" and you'll notice I can't finish the sentence because what the FUCK.  I never want to watch someone PALM a piece of cake, MY piece, like it's a motherfucking steak; and when I say no whipped cream, I never want anyone to roll their eyes and attempt to scrape the whipped cream off of the palmed piece of cake; and I never want to have to say ""NO THAT'S NOT A THING CUT ANOTHER PIECE YOU ARE THE REASON WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS""; and I never want to start having symptoms of a rage stroke in a motherfucking Cheesecake Factory lobby as I watch the same asshole cut a new smaller piece (BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO PALM, I ASSUME) and all without ever changing gloves.  Please promptly message me if you can direct me to a place where I might address the increasing urgency of my carrot cake needs because I don't know what in the living fuck that nonsense last night was but the devil is a lie.  #THESTRUGGLE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Eric M.,"Hilltop, Columbus, OH",0,7,,1.0,11/14/2015,"This was an extremely bad experience for me and my family, especially since we were coming here for a couple of birthdays. I concede that it was very busy at the time but we waited over an hour for our food and all the dishes were cold by the time we got them. I'm trying not to blame the waiter (who's name I did not get), but he did not offer any excuse as to why our food was late or why they were all cold. And it especially didn't help when he almost put his tie into my food several times when he was trying to refill some waters at our table. I've had decent experiences here before but we spent about an hour and a half from being seated to getting our food. This will most likely be my last time I go here and I can't recommend anyone going here for a larger party because you will be waiting for an extremely long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Jennifer A.,"Mentor, OH",57,13,12,3.0,9/21/2015,They were out of several dishes our party of 9 tried to order last evening.  All salmon dishes and shrimp platters. That was disappointing but mostly that they did not tell the people who ordered the shrimp platters they did not have them until right when everyone else was receiving their food. So these people had to wait for the new food to be made. While we ate. They got their food much later. Nothing was offered to them. We had to ask. When we did and the manager came. He was surprised no one had told him much earlier so he could have handled. Food was good but they handled the situation poorly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Rebecca B.,"Columbus, OH",1,15,,2.0,10/31/2015,Not thrilled. Quility of food is not represented by the high prices. My $15 fish tacos should have been $7. Same for my husband and daughters meals. Over priced for not great food. Not surprised though anybody with that many items on there menu usually don't hit the mark on all of it. There known for cheesecake so that's all they should do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Tory R.,"Westerville, OH",185,278,312,3.0,12/11/2011,"I love the food at the Cheesecake factory!! My favorite is the bang bang chicken and shrimp. And it's one of the best things for you (calorie-wise) on the menu.  This particular location is usually rather busy, being in Easton and all. I went on a Thursday evening with my parents and our wait was around 30-35 minutes.....but the people watching was good....plus, we also had a menu and it took about that long to look through it to find out what we wanted! :o) The only thing I don't like about this place is that their prices keep going up. I'm kind've a tight-wad...especially around the holidays. My favorite dish (bang bang chicken & shrimp) is now $17.95. And that's just for the actual meal. If you want a caesar salad (side salad) is $8.95. Really??!! And then of course you have to have dessert. In my case it's either carrot cake or one of the chocolate cakes because I just don't like cheesecake.  This is a good place to go one in a while....but I'm not willing to submit to the rediculous prices on a routine basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
T T.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,2.0,5/31/2016,"I ordered a ribeye.  The good news:  I ordered it medium rare and it was prepared properly.  The bad news:  It was way too salty.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce--seemed like a wine sauce or demi-glace of some type, or it was some type of rub they prepped it with, but whatever they doused it in spoiled the taste of an otherwise perfectly prepared cut of meat.  The mashed potatoes, bread and salad were good, but that does not offset the price of the meal.  For the price of the steak, comparable to restaurants for which steak is their specialty, it shouldn't taste like salt pork.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus?start=100
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2015,20 minutes 20 more minutes after 20 minutes.
