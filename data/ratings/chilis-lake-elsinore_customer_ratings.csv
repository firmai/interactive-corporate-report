I went to COSTCO with my neighbors, We were very hungry so I decided to treat them to Chili's!  We sat down at a booth, We ordered our food and drinks, Our drinks came somewhat quickly, however I looked at my smartphone when we got our food and it took 90 minutes to get it and the restaurant was not busy!

We had drink which were awesome, appetizers which were awesome then dinner and desert awesome awesome!

122,Matt D.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,,2.0,2012-08-06,I have been going here about 2 times a month ever since the day it opened (not many choices for a nice sit down lunch in Elsinore). Today I ordered the same chicken sandwich I always get. They have cut WAY back on the servings. Our bun was half the size of the usual one and the chicken was about 1/3 rd of an 8oz breast. We were informed that they are cutting the size of some meals to save money. I am very disappointed in this. I can get a better Chicken sandwich at am/pm now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

Then it seemed as if we were invisible because from that point on, there were no refills on the iced tea, no one to ask if we needed anything...nothing. They are going through a remodel and I guess this has thrown everyone into a tail spin. Finally we waved down I believe to be the day manager and she too was rude.

She seated us in the bar area booth table because ""all of the dining room tables were dirty, and it wasn't her job to clean them."" After ordering it took 30 minutes for the appetizer to get to the table. My sister got her meal right after the appetizer and they apparently forgot about mine. About halfway through my sister's meal I was asked if I got my food, and she ran to the back to get it. They were not staffed for customers even though customers were there.

I had the Grilled Chicken with Mac and Cheese. It was delicious! The cheese was perfect. I loved that it was baked so the cheese and bread crumbs had a crispy, oooey, goooey, cheeeewy top.

127,Nikki D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",95,8,,1.0,2013-06-24,"I don't write reviews very often, but I felt like taking the time to write a review about this place. Went there with my husband, sister, brother-in-law, and 3 nieces; we got there around 7:30/8pmish. It was after the dinner rush, but since it was happy hour Sunday we sat in the bar area. My husband and I did the 2 for $20 and so did my sister and her husband. The 2 for $20 is an appetizer and 2 meals. I also ordered a side salad. We waited for quite some time, and then finally after my husband got up looking for our waitress and asked the waitress where our appetizers and salad were, then they were brought out, BUT what followed them were our meals. The table was bombarded with plates and food and we wanted to eat our appetizers first which then made all of us eat our dinner cold. We expressed our irritation to the waitress and the runners but of course nothing but and ""oh sorry"" was done. At this time the manager should have come out without us even having to ask to check up since we very much so expressed our irritation. Another problem, the 3 nieces had kid meals and the waitress never brought out their soda's, so again my husband went back to find her and told her that she forgot, and she came back with an attitude saying that we never told her to bring them soda. I heard my brother-in-law tell her to bring them sodas. Both my sister and I used to waitress at a different Chili's when we were younger and this by far was the worst we have experienced from them. Typically the highest/best server works the bar area and this server acted as if it was her first night. She obviously didn't put the food orders in correctly and caused all the food to come out at once. Which is fine, I get it we are human, but make up for it. Tell the Manager what you did, apologize for your mistake, and make up for your lousy service. To top off the experience, I called my sister just now to ask how she was because both my husband and I had stomach issues (reason why I decided to write the review) and her and her husband and kids also had stomach issues! Save yourself the stomach bug and horrible service and try either another Chili's or Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.404,2.72

But a couple weeks ago i went here and had a horrible experience. My boyfriend ordered a steak from the 2 for $20, and i ordered chicken strips. He told the waitress he would like his steak cooked medium rare. When the food came out, the waitress asked my boyfriend to cut into the steak to make sure it was cooked the way he wanted. Well when he cut it, it was pure raw meat. So gross! Looked like it jumped from the freezer to his plate. Blood from the meat was coming out on his mashed potatoes and broccoli. We told the manager who was not very attentive, but the waitress got him a new plate. When it came time to pay, I asked if there would be some kind of discount or something, because my and my boyfriends appetite was completely ruined after seeing this bloody piece of raw meat. The waitress went to ask the manager and came back to tell us that the best she could do was $4 off. He couldnt even offer the meal free, they still had to suck up some kind of money for that nasty plate right! I will not be returning here and recommend you all check your meat before biting into it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.504,2.64

138,Keith J.,"Sun City, CA",0,13,,1.0,2013-11-25,"UPDATE 2/28/2015: (Our original review 11/25/2013 below still stands, beware.) Terrible wait (lunch on Saturday). (May be an overloaded kitchen, but service is STILL sluggish.)  And a ripoff now! ""Half Rack Ribs"" is pathetic: 4 puny/skimpy  ""piglet"" ribs with some basted potato chunks, but no vegetable, no slaw or salad. Well, the ice tea was okay but refills slow to come. They want you to use this funky monitor touch-screen on the table to order. No way; a real server has answers and recommendations but this dumb TV-thing is an insult. Perhaps Chili's is trying to increase profits by paying servers less, or maybe wanting to look cool with a little computer screen on each table. (I turned it away facing the wall and demanded real service!) ================================= PREVIOUS 11/25/2013  REVIEW: IMPORTANT! This review is for one particular lunch at Chili's. We live close by and thus visit Chili's often, usually satisfactory but not remarkable, like some of the bar-restaurants in town are. Firstly; the downer experience on 11/13/13. The waiter was totally inattentive. (""John"" perhaps was his name?) He was mostly in the kitchen scamming on the lady waitresses. Totally indifferent, uninterested, even arrogant when we ordered a single lunch combo plus an extra salad, and a couple of Iced teas. No alcohol, minimum bill. None of those ""designer"" cutsie-spendy items on the menu. So I guess he figured it would be a ""Duh"" tip so that's what we got: ""Duh"" service. Painfully slow. Usually lunch at most places is fast, since many folks have work to return to or other business planned for the afternoon. It seems to be vogue these days for restaurants like Chili's to put servers in ""teams"" of two. Presumably to streamline service.  Amusing since the only time we saw the ""partner"" lady was when I finally went to the kitchen door and asked for the bill, and everyone snapped to! Now the best part. ""John"" padded our bill. He added some kind of designer fruit drink. (Is Chili's on a kind of quota system?) Instead of $17, it came to about $20. When asked, ""John"" said ""Oh, my finger must have slipped."" First time EVER I've left a  zero tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.6280000000000006,2.32

Having a last minute change of plans we decided to go out to dinner. We got to Chili's at 6:45 was told we had a 25 minute wait. There were other parties waiting too. Some up to 45 min.  Around 7:15 , still waiting I went to use the restroom.  I saw 3 empty tables n 2 booths.when I got back I mentioned to my friend and the rude front end manager stepped in and started giving me attitude.  ""Okay I wasn't not talking to you. However,if I was, I would tell you that as a person who works in the food industry you need to cover your arms . As no one wants to see your bingo wings while they eat""! There is nothing wrong with being a big girl, just dress appropriate for your job. We were seated shortly after her lip  ,thanks. Immediately the waitress was asking us if we were ready. A little annoying. We ordered our food and it took forever to get to us. Just after 8. For a burger and salad. However I must say our waitress Josie was friendly and on top of the drinks,  but never apologized for the wait. The food is mediocre and the staff as well. Its just okay.

The wait to be seated wasn't too long but the half booth they seated us at was pretty dirty. My boyfriend ordered a ""watermelon"" lemonade, I put that in quotations because there wasn't really any kind of watermelon flavor to it. It tasted like a watered down version of that pink lemonade you get at in n out. We asked the waiter for a different drink to replace this one.  My boyfriend ordered some wings and the shrimp tacos. I ordered the crispy style chicken crispers. My boyfriend liked his wings and said the the shrimp tacos were actually spicy, and he isn't weak to spicy like I am. I enjoyed my crispy chicken crispers that are served with French fries (nothing special) and corn on the cob :D Something really neat at Chili's is this little touch screen device they have on all the tables called a Ziosk. You can play games on it (for a fee). You can cruise drinks, desserts & appetizers on it and you can pay your check on it!

Once we walked over to the bar there was one clean table.  There was other empty...just filthy.  The one table did not accommodate our party, so I asked the hostess to clean the table.   After being seated for about 10 min I had to get up and ask the hostess if there was a server there, because not only had Noone helped us, I had not seen ANY server in the bar at all.  After the hostess hunted down the server we asked the server what was the specials for happy hour that the hostess had mentioned.   Blank stare was all we got then told us it was on the new ziosk tablet they now have.  So we had to read it for ourselves which must not have been convenient for her either since she asked if we wanted more time.  Uhhhhh NO!  I was afraid we would never see her again.  So we ordered our drinks and a couple appetizers so we would not starve just in case she disappeared.  Enter new waitress with our appetizers.  Other lady never came back as guessed.  She introduced her self and let us know other lady was going home.  Whooo Hoooo!  Troubles over?  Heck no!  The table side guacamole was served with hard, unripe avacados.  I asked for a new one just as the Flatbread cane out.   Finally I can eat...NOPE...raw dough on the flatbread!  Sent that back.  We did get a decent guacamole and the flavor was pretty good after that.  We decided to order dessert and had the cookie and ice cream thing.  We ordered two.  Took a while to get them,  and when they came....guess what?????  RAW!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.568,2.56

137,Jessica S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,24,5.0,4.0,2014-08-19,The only reason I give this place 4 stars is... I've been here more than a few times and it's either a 3 star experience or a 5.  With that said... The 5 star experience-service was excellent. Very much on top of everything and never waited for anything. They were so sweet from the front door to the table. The food-awesome. I remember hating chilis because of the food. Definitely picked up their game. Everything my family and I ordered was delicious.  The 3 star experience-the food. Still DELICIOUS. You can't beat the chips n gauc. Every item we ordered on the menu again was superb. The only downfall? The service- but I don't blame the servers. I blame the management for not staffing accordingly. I went with my family on a random Wednesday night and the place was full (as it should be!) but there was only two servers in the bar (as it seemed) with no busser. I feel they did as well as they could but they couldn't keep up with the business flow. That's what happens when you step up your game chilis!

151,Greg B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",23,24,,5.0,2014-08-30,"Finally writing this. Well it was two days ago but who could forget a spectacular turn around for Chili's. I never really ate there before the last year or so. After going to Chili's in Moreno Valley and having terrible food, rude, delayed, wrong items service and the manager doing nothing to correct it really, we decided that Chili's can kick rocks. According to friends in MoVal it has not gotten any better with the staff that that location even after the last year of cooling off.... Now to the good part. Chili's took me at my word listened and took down the names and times. They sent me chili's bucks (lack of a better term) in the amount of $25.00 for my bad service.  We decided to give the Chili's in Lake Elsinore a shot.  Server: Scotty (she was the best) Server: Cammie (not our server but came to visit and make fun of Scotty and see how we were doing. Sarcasm heals all wounds) Manager: Jeff (he came over checked in on us and made sure Scotty was being good) Sarcasm aside they were all nice people and we all interacted great. The food was perfect, hot, on time, and the way we ordered it. They never really forgot about us or any other table as they all appear to work together at this location. Jeff and the management staff deserve a round of applause for encouraging their servers to be outgoing, friendly, and yet professional and detail oriented.  Scotty took care of all of our needs and was so funny when she saw the Chili's bucks and how much her eye got a surprised look. I explained and we both agreed that Chili's Lake Elsinore is definitely not Moreno Valley.  I wish other restaurants would realize that the staff is the face of the company. The food is second to them and that the atmosphere really does make a difference when we are paying for dinners. Lake Elsinore Chili's seems to have figured it all out. Bill was over a hundred before the discount's (chili's bucks and senior citizen for my mom) they made every effort to be the best they could after a long and semi negative day they knew nothing about. The three people mentioned in this case deserve a raise and high five.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.9000000000000004,2.84

You will see the server about three times in your entire 2 and a half hour to 3 hour visit. If you have children you can authorize a .99 cent charge on the computer thing they have on the tables to unlock games, but beware, if there isn't one on your table they still charge you. No big deal it's a dollar but they should be more attentive. The food is ok I've been in 3 times and one the food was over salted, second the food was cold, third the food was bland. The prices are $$ so since the service is bad, the wait is horrible, you expect at least the food to be delicious. The only plus side to it would be that it's a good place to hang out, if you have the time and patience, go for it. Not for me since I have two children one is nine so the games keep her entertained but one is 8 months old, patience is not her forte, and it does tend to get crowded and loud.

Walked in to dirty plates sitting on the table and everyone just walking past us like they had no desire to clean them away. .bartender grabbed them and moved it across to the other side of the bar (still there 20 minutes later)  Then when i  ask for a menu she informs me everything i need to order is on the computer which has nothing on it..not to mention it was sticky and stuck to the counter.. Finally i get a menu from her and it's covered in food...SeriouSly chick clean your menu!! Let's move onto ordering drinks...one beer one pineapple  margarita...two dirty glasses...handed to us by the top of the glass where she expects our mouths to go...um no bitch not happening.  At this point Im done.  I'm not a fancy girl or high maintenance but i would like a clean glass and place to sit. After all those rolled up into not wanting anything at all from that place we decided to speak to a manager about not paying for our drinks we didnt touch and leave.   We waited 15 minutes for a manager to inform us that he was understaffed tonight and he was sorry and we were welcome to leave in his most smart ass wanna be punched in the throat voice.

Well, that came to an end on Valentines Day. Absolutely the worst service, meal etc. Things seemed ordinary except there were a lot of tables not bussed So, the hostess took us to a booth everything was fine and dandy. We placed our order and ordered a soup and a salad for me. Finished those off and usually in another 5 or so minutes we would be served our meal, NOT THIS TIME! 40-minutes went by and finally our plates came out. I ordered the 10oz sirloin RARE came out Well Done same with my wife's (keep in mind Valentines Day, which should be special not messed up) The manager came over (John) very politely apologized for the mistake and said they would redo our meal and it should be another 5-7 minutes. Well, it wasn't. How about another 40-minutes. About now I'm pissed. The meal finally comes my wife's 6oz Sirloin is perfect a nice small thick steak done rare and me I get the 10oz thin Sirloin steak done medium...Arraguah! Normally when you order a rare steak it's not a thin cut because it's harder to cook it rare and they failed to make it rare. The manger John said we'll comp your whole meal and again apologized and said when you're done get a dessert on us as well. How nice? So the waitress jokingly said she'd place the dessert order and GUESS WHAT???? Another 25-plus minute wait. Okay it was free and we will always remember Valentines Day at Chili's.

They used to cook my burger a perfect medium rare, but the past two times, even after my reminding them when ordering and pleading with the server to get it right, the burger was dry and waaaay over cooked. Yeah they offered to redo it, but that's not reasonable when your wife is already eating and you have time limitations. A restaurant needs to get it right the first time.  So we went back a week later after one bad meal because they promised it wouldn't happen again but it did, so I'm done with Chilis. On a separate visit at the bar, they also blew it.

Well Saturday night service was awful. It started when we were seated. The waitress was in a super rush taking our drink order and when the blackberry iced teas came out, they tasted awful. She did what she could to make the drinks right so I figured no big deal. We ordered an appetizer and shortly afterwards we ordered our meals. The appetizer came out just fine and my husband, daughter and I enjoyed it. Well then the real issues came about. We sat for at least 45 minutes and our actual meals still hadn't come out. My husband flagged down the waitress to find out what the hold up was. She went to check and came out with my daughters food (kids corn dog meal) which was piping hot that she couldn't even eat it. At this point I'm just pissed. They obviously put a rush on the kids meal or else why was it so hot? I think they forgot to put our order in. Well I flagged down the waitress and asked her to call the manager over to our table. When the manager came over he apologized for the delay and said the food would be out shortly. I mean he did try to make it right, I'm not going to lie. But at that point it was well close to an hour and our food still hadn't come out. He said he was going to take care of the bill for us and asked if we wanted our food to go. I was so done I didn't want any food to go. I just wanted to get out of there and honestly I wasn't even hungry anymore . I've worked in a restaurant before so I am usually extremely understanding when it comes to kitchen screw ups or wait staff issues but the thing is I had to flag down our waitress to find out where our food was. She should have come over and explained and apologized for the delay before I asked to speak to a manager.

Best if you go to another location, because Chili's food, when it's hot is delicious. Problem is, this place no longer knows how to serve it that way.

The waitress came by in a reasonable amount of time to take my drink order and then took almost 15 minutes to bring it.

To my surprise the service was great and so was the food. The servers and I assume managers or hosts kept checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed and to do if we were satisfied with our meals. Was a great experience. Today, decided to give it another try. So I went out on a limb and took my girlfriend and her daughter there because they have a decent kid friendly menu.

We've tried visiting this location now on several occasions. We typically don't dine in, but did so a few weeks ago and I forgot to do a review then. Service dining in went well and our server was great and attentive at the bar. Our table can now order and pay our bills with their tablets actually, but our drinks and tableside guacamole Service still kept us content.  However, on a more recent visit this evening, and like many takeout service evenings, it's very disappointing. Hoping our critique can help improve their training. Called to place an order for guacamole, queso, chips and salsa. First call, young lady transfers us to takeout but disconnects us. Photos will display this sequence of events. Called back and we were in hold for 8+min so we hopped in the car to just drive there and for giggles stayed on the line to see if we would beat them to picking up our call. Since I wasn't driving I proceed to place my order online, rummage around emails and password retrievals, place the order online by 8:20 Sat PM and online confirmation stayed it'd be ready by 8:40. (20 min) We park and I wait in the car on hold while my guy picks up the food. End of the story I am on hold for almost 30 min. My guy exits WITH our takeout in hand before anyone even picked up the phone. It was hilarious, after all was said and done. The only saving element to our experience tonight was that logging in to our Chili's account I learned we had a birthday dessert credit and could be redeemed tonight. So, left with a delicious cookie and vanilla ice cream skillet treat. Hope their takeout service improves and take our notes to heart.

I have to tell you: I rarely leave negative feed back for a restaurant but this time I was really disappointed.  my daughters quesadilla salad was not edible. The leaves of lettuce throughout the dish were brown and wilted, the chicken was undercooked and had a mysterious slimy coating, the entire dish including the quesadilla slices was drowned in waaay too much dressing. no part of the the entire dish was edible. unfortunately, she did not say anything until after I had closed out the check.  another thing that was not pleasant: the Ziosk tablet computer terminal that was left at our table was covered in what felt like the last several hundred customer's sauces and sugary drinks which had dried to a sticky / greasy mess on the exterior surface of the device. when I went to pay the bill my hand was instantly contaminated with the food residue from what felt like every patron who had ever sat at that table. I actually had to wipe the screen clear of dried sauce just so i could sign the bill. just plain disgusting. I mentioned the situation to the waiter and he said it was because they were so crowded and understaffed. I get it. It is not the waiters fault. I would expect a chain like chili's to at least offer to the terrible salad off the ticket but they did not.  I find it disappointing that a big chain restaurant like chili's would have a nice family dining experience destroyed by careless housekeeping and a terrible presentation on such a simple dish. Maybe this was just an off night for this restaurant's staff... but I can tell you that I will not be back to this location to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,2.84,2.82,2.82,,2.828
16,Diana T.,"Perris, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-29,"I came in with my sister in law 3 girls and 1 teenager on a Friday night, yes I understand that it's Friday and busy but when they tell you the wait is 20-30 minutes and you end up waiting 45 minutes because the guy that was supposed to check you did not even bother to do his job that is very unacceptable, until they sat everyone else down and they saw me bothered by the wait he asked what was my name..... he looked me up and I was not even on the list for the wait.... gladly the server was a nice guy and really treated us right and made sure the girls where served promptly.  I'm still sitting here and I hope to update the stars by the end of the service being provided by my serve whom has been really good.  If I were the manage I would definitely approach those waiting so long and apologized for the wait.... I know customer service and the only good customer service I have received here has been by the serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,2.84,2.78,2.78,,2.804
3,Stephen C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,35,41.0,4.0,2017-12-30,"Chili's was busy this afternoon, we waited 15 min before getting a seat. I don't mind the wait, but there was empty tables and tables that had not been cleared off from the last guest plates and drinks (seemed that someone called out or restaurant is short staffed). I ordered the spinach queso dip for me and my wife to share. Dip was good, however the paper thin chips did not work well for scooping dip (need to upgrade to a thicker chip). Also I ordered the old timer cheese burger, this is a great burger, fresh patty I had cooked medium and would definitely order again. Overall the staff was friendly and did the best they could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,2.8,2.77,2.77,,2.782
10,Yolanda R.,"Murrieta, CA",37,7,,1.0,2017-12-31,Let me start by saying that chili's is one of my favorite restaurants but this location in lake elsinore is not a good place to eat. My husband and I had the worst experience. We ordered the fries and cheese jalapeno appetizer and it was over cooked and left solid as a rock. So we asked them to exchange it for the traditional cheese and chips appetizer and that was awful. We should of got up and left but we didnt. We said maybe the steak meal will be delicious like at all the other chili's restaurants. We were served 2 sirloin steaks with their loaded mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. My steak was not done the way I asked so it was taken back to cook a little longer and it got burnt. The mashed potatoes were very dry on both plates and broccoli was barely steamed. We will not be going to this location ever again. Also the restaurant was very dusty where we were sitting the wall between the booths were very dusty like they haven't been cleaned for weeks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,2.8,2.77,2.77,,2.782
5,Anthony S.,"Las Vegas, NV",486,26,6.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"My wife and I come here regularly and we've always had a great experience, but this last visit went from what could have been a bad experience to a really great one. Our appetizer was a little cold so we they offered to bring a new order without question, but it ended up coming at the same as our entree which I was bummed about, but then Mel the manager offered us the appetizer on the house and I thought that was really cool. They could have not really cared, because it wasn't that huge of a deal, but they went out of their way to make sure their customers were satisfied and that's rare to find in restaurants these days. Thanks everyone! We will definitely continue to keep coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,2.96,2.81,2.81,,2.87
1,Kery G.,"Palmdale, CA",98,30,11.0,2.0,2018-01-06,"Service was slow, waitress did not come around until after we received our food which by that time all of our drinks were empty. Ordered an old timer with a black bean patty. I specifically told her ""no"" when she asked if I wanted cheese. Burger came with cheese, had I wanted cheese I'd have been highly disappointed as it was almost indistinguishable but for the crispy bits on the side. When my burger came back it came with fries and garlic pickles thrown on the side, no mustard and a mushy black bean patty that wouldn't stay together. The 2 stars is due to the 3 other people being satisfied with their food. The last time we ate at a Chili's (Santa Clarita) the service and food (mine) were also unsatisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,3.0,2.78,2.78,,2.8680000000000003
0,Monica C.,"Pasadena, CA",1074,494,537.0,3.0,2018-01-09,"It's a Chili's- made popular by awkward first teenage dates and large family gatherings. If you don't know the food then you haven't been living in the US in the past decade. This is a rather large Chili's that exists in it's little mall. Service for lunch was A OK, although the orders came out wrongish. If you order iced tea- they pretty much give you a bucket of it, which makes up for the order mistake in my book.  It was 114 degrees the day I went and the AC was working very well. That's worth all the good service in the world to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore,3.08,2.77,2.77,,2.894
