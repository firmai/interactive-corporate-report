18,Shawna A.,"Oreland, PA",39,119,5.0,3.0,2012-03-06,"3.5. this seems like a solid chain option. the seating is cozy, the place (from what i've seen) looks pretty clean and i enjoyed my avocado burger as much as i could--knowing that it's all artificial crap (wherever i go out to eat; i don't care if it's a chain or it's not, same shit, really) always makes it hard to enjoy eating out as much as everybody else, but anyway, i digress. everybody else at my table pretty much had fajitas (chicken, shrimp and beef)...i tried the fajitas and thought they tasted good for being over-processed and a little on the salty side...i mean, i've had much better...anyway, still good. my husband says a solid four stars for above-average food, location and cleanliness but we really don't see eye-to-eye on these sorts of things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jenkintown?start=20,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

It didn't appear to be very busy. Finally someone sat us at a booth. We sat and waited for a server to come up to us for at least 10 minutes. I have an impatient 7 year old, and was not happy.

4,Nicole R.,"Cheltenham Township, PA",12,37,3.0,3.0,2015-05-31,"I could take it or leave it. The food is good for what you pay for & expect at a chain restaurant. I was unsatisfied with my most recent trip here. I went with my family- a table of four. Everything was fine at first, but the waitress did not check on us for at least 15 minutes after she dropped off the food. Some of us needed refills etc. By the time she did come over (after my little sister had to walk up to the bar & tell her we needed her), we had all already finished eating. She was actually bar tending & serving people seated at the bar while also serving tables. I don't blame her completely, but I also don't understand why the management would give her tables & expect her to bard tend on a Saturday.   When she came to our table we asked for refills, the check, and boxes-she walked away without asking how many we needed.  Keep in mind there were 4 of us, all with leftovers- but she only brought 2 boxes. We then had to wait minutes more for her to get more boxes, at which point she asked me if I needed any ramekin style to go containers for my fajita toppings. Too late- I already packaged my food. We still tipped 20%, because the service wasn't horrible- but being a former server myself, a lot of  basics were overlooked.

38,Susan F.,"Abington, PA",0,11,,5.0,2015-11-01,"My boyfriend and I have always loved Chilis, but in the last year or so this particular location has become our favorite restaurant in the area. The food and drinks are always delicious. It's good at all Chilis locations really. What sets this particular location apart from the rest is the staff.  Everyone from the hosts to the servers to the bartenders to the cooks to the management is AMAZING.  Everyone is so friendly, funny, polite... We have gotten to know so many of the people there that it feels more we are seeing friends rather than going into a ""business"". And because of that environment, it makes us want to go back more and more.  The management team here is EXCELLENT. They truly go out of their way to make sure the customers are happy. You can count on someone from management to stop by your table just to check on you and make sure your experience is going well and that everything is taken care of. By far my favorite restaurant to go to in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jenkintown,,,,,
2,Erin B.,"Jenkintown, PA",1,5,,3.0,2016-03-19,"Well, the potential is there. The execution leaves a lot to be desired. They need to go back to basics with their staff- management included! This was once one of our favorite restaurants, now it's no longer even in rotation. We got a gift card for the holidays so decided to order take out last night. After placing the order online, I waited until the time indicated in the confirmation and went to pick up. The hostess pointed to a sign that said ""take out orders"" and said to stand under there. That was weird, it was in an odd place to stand. After many employees walked past me finally someone asked if I was being helped. I told her I was there to pick up an order and no, no help yet. She said oh you go to the bar for take out. Hmm, now I'm already getting annoyed at this ""process"", I head to the bar next, repeat AGAIN why I'm here, the bartender goes to check on my order. He comes back and says- sorry, we never got your order, the new computer system isn't letting us get the online orders. Well as you can see this restaurant is trying hard to not serve food. This was 8:30 pm on a Friday night and the place was practically empty, i can see why! The bartender was apologetic and sincere, he was the only one out of place... He offered to place my order and ask for the kitchen to rush if possible, which I agreed to. He said he'd let the manager know what happened. I then waited 30 minutes for the food and watched the manager walk past me at least five times without ever saying a word to me. Even a simple Hey, sorry about that would've been appreciated.  Now the food was actually quite good once I finally got it home, the Mango avocado chicken was very tasty! Or I was starving at that point!  Hopefully they find some FOH leadership and fix some of these basics! It would change a lot for their business, I guarantee it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jenkintown?start=20,,,,,

I usually get the chipotle chicken crispers with different sides. I've gotten desserts too--the chocolate chip cookie is yummy! The service is usually good. However, for large groups, the experience was a lot different. I went with a group and the computer was down so receipts couldn't be printed and orders couldn't be placed which caused a tizzy.

It was 3 wrapped tortilla shells.  Cold and sticking to each other and incredibly small. I have come to expect warm flat tortilla at Mexican restaurants - usually served in a covered bowl.  I have NO idea how long these had been prerolled and sitting in the kitchen.  THEN came the meal.  The steak cooked to leather consistency AND was so small.  It was literally 9 pieces that were about 1-2"" long and not even as wide or thick as a Popsicle stick.  I wasn't even sure it was the steak.  The shrimp was cooked and seasoned to perfection but the steak was a joke.  They have the new table top pay machines and ask for a survey.  While praising the staff the food and dining experience was the worst at a Chili's  We wont be returning",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jenkintown,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
