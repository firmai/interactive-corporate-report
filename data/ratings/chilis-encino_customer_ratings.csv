We waited about 15 minutes just to see our waitress, by the time she arrived we were all ready to order.  My son spilled his drink, 2 waiters passed by and completely ignored us when we tried telling them about the spilled drink.  The hostess even had the nerve to sit a family behind us where the drink was running on the floor.  about 20 minutes after we were done eating our waitress finally showed up and we asked for the check.  She must of gone out to cut the tree to get the paper to print our check on because it took another 20 minutes for her to return with our check!  And we weren't the only customers frustrated, there was another table across from us upset.  The worst part was the fact that it wasn't busy at all!!!!

187,Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",813,33,8.0,4.0,2012-01-13,"Good restaurant, but I would specifically rate this on the lower end of the scale rather than a solid 4 stars. I've eaten at this location of Chili's several times now and my friend and I always order the Chili 2 for $20; it's a lot of food for just $20 bucks!  The appetizer we almost always order is their Texas Cheese Fries (see my pic) and the baby back ribs, and surprisingly, the ribs have always been cooked to a tender perfection.  The ambience is nice and one aspect that I like about this particular Chili's is that they have plenty of random travel photos throughout the restaurant, along with other interesting items planted throughout the restaurant to make you amuse with fascination. The service has been good but then again, I've always frequented during their slower hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=240,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.8640000000000003,2.76

Even though your food is such an average selection and average flavors, it always is so damn good, I find myself wondering, ""why haven't I been to Chili's in a while?"" The food is always good and their chocolate chip paradise pie is the best dessert I've ever had. The coconut, chcoolate, brownie, ice cream.. Delicious! Service is always great at any Chili's location. I had only been to this Chili's once and decided to come here again and try out the bar with a friend. The drinks were made STRONG (A+) and our appetizers were delicious, even if a little greasy.

127,Sarah K.,"Burbank, CA",120,964,139.0,2.0,2012-03-12,"Alas, the broccoli raw and overcooked, and I truly do not recommend the sirloin. The meat was too chewy, even though I ordered it medium rare. Service was decent for a large party (there were about 14 of us), but the service lacked on drink refills. I DID appreciate that the service allowed us to break up into our own separate bills.  I did like the corn guacamole; chips are light and airy, perfect for dipping and not taking away from the guacamole. Also on the plus side, Chili's has Coke Zero, which I greatly prefer to Diet Coke. But two stars for you, Chili's, since my primary course was non edible. I prefer TGIFs to Chili's, if I have to go to a standard Americana chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=140,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.6000000000000005,2.88
204,Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80.0,3.0,2012-03-12,"Chili's is a typical chain American restaurant & grill.  The service can be good or bad depending on factors.  Large groups (8+) tend to over tax them and orders get messed up or forgotten, and will never come out at the same time.  Stick to smaller groups.  This one even tried to set 3 people of a 18 group party by themselves at a different table. As to the food, eh.  Its pretty average across the board.  There are a few really good items, the southwest eggrolls being on the yummy side.  If you have foursquare you can always get free chips and salsa (which are decent) for checking in.  The burgers are decent size and the onion straws are good.  The have a black bean patty if your a veggie eater.   The fajitas have gone a little down hill over the years and are now straight average and not a large portion. The steaks can be surprisingly good if they cook them right (2 out of 3 at our table were good).  There are a decent selection of health opinion as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=200,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.7640000000000002,2.84

We had a big party, around 14 people. Someone called ahead which helped with the wait time. This place was packed for a Sunday, apparently this is the place to be in Encino.  The service was pretty good. I always cringe when a big party gets together, it is usually never a good thing. Drinks were flying out, tons of water and coke zero piling up all around me. My friends seemed very happy with the booze specials and all of the deals on the menu, Two for $20, Two for $35 and so on.  I started off with the buffalo wings and thought they were good. Super fresh and crispy served with tasty blue cheese dressing. For my main course I had the salmon and doubled up on broccoli. Salmon was well seasoned and well done...but completely what I expected from this type of restaurant. The broccoli was all over the place, some cooked and some raw, I don't know how they managed that.  Server split the bills for every couple which was very appreciated and unexpected.

They also advised that one of the food ordered would take even longer than the awaited time, got one of the orders wrong and  forgot to bring one of the food that was ordered - so had to take it to go because by that time everyone already finished eating. No one refilled our drinks or even offered. One of the reasons might be the lack of staff but they should know better -since its lunch time.

125,Jason K.,"Van Nuys, CA",96,120,223.0,5.0,2012-07-22,"On my way to Chili's tonight, I was thinking, ""I should find some time to post my 3.5 star review"" from several years of collective monthly visits. But tonight's dinner changed everything. Sunday night, 6 PM, a booth for 2 kids and 2 adults. Tiffany was our server. And while most of the servers here have been very good, we've never had service nearly as good as we did tonight... at any restaurant. It's amazing how just one person can make such a difference. From the get-go we had everything we needed. Tiffany took our drink orders and before we had a chance to ask, we already had extra napkins (a necessity for a table with kids) waiting for us on the table. I didn't even see her set them down. Our chips and salsa arrived (with my special request for pico de gallo) and she brought side plates for each of us -- a dozen recent visits and we've never received plates with our appetizer. Drinks are refilled just before we empty them and plates are scooped up before they start crowding the table. Shockingly, we had constant service and attention as if we were her only table. Not once did we have to wait for something. She was on top of it all. Our service was in harmony with the food, which was fresh and well-prepared. Another pleasant surprise. It's a shame to be so blown away by such great service, but it really is rare, especially at a chain like Chili's. Tiffany could probably make twice as much at a 5-star restaurant, but I hope Chili's finds a way to keep her around. TIPS: * Call ahead on busy nights to put your name on the list. * There is open seating at the tables and booths in the bar area. * Parking is available in the mall parking lot, the underground garage and at meters on the street (free after 8 PM and all day on Sundays). * They occasionally have ""Kids Eat Free Days"" which you can find about by signing up for their emails (you may need their printable coupon). * The $20 Dinner for Two deal is worth checking out - go for the chicken fajitas! * Kids fountain drinks and lemonade get free refills (just like adult drinks), but milks are not refillable. * Check Facebook for other promotions and deals like free appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.772,3.2000000000000006

I came here with my boyfriend, who is in the army, and my mom. He had a burger from the special menu. My mom and I went for the 2 for $20 deal. We picked the fried cheese appetizer along with the Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas and the Roasted Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend also checked in on Foursquare and was able to score free chips and salsa! To drink, he got a mango iced tea, which unfortunately he didn't enjoy too much.  We were seated quickly, we placed our order, and about 15 minutes later, our food arrived! We didn't even have time to complain that our food was missing. My mom and I also ordered an El Nino Margarita. We ordered that a bit later, and that took the most time getting to our table.  The fried cheese (mozzarella sticks, basically) were nice and cheesy! We split that amongst the three of us. By the end of our meal, that was all gone.  My mom loved her spicy chicken fajitas! They had tortillas, guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and salsa on the side. Perfect to even out the spice.  I loved loved loved loved the Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. It comes in a red pepper sauce which wasn't too spicy. That came with rice (yum yum) and broccoli (wasn't too good). I can't believe I contemplated against the red pepper chicken.  We finally got the El Nino Margarita. It was good. I normally wouldn't have picked it, but my mom wanted it. Somehow, my boyfriend had room for dessert. For Veterans, it was $5 (again, off of a special menu). He had the Oreo® Topped Molten Cake (A decadent, cream-filled cake, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, Oreo® cookie pieces and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. LIMITED TIME OFFER. GET IT WHILE IT LASTS!) -- Straight from their website! He LOVED it!

The only had two to three tables to fit five to six people. After asked the person in the front a few times as to when a table would be ready, she stated as soon as some would got up. A group of six people got up from a table and that open table was given to a party who gave 35 minutes after us and they were seated because the had children. Horrible service. After another 10 minutes, we were finally seated.  Went to the restroom to wash my hands. Disgusting inside. It looked like no one had checked inside the bathroom all day. Washed my hands and got out if there.  Got back to the table and ordered chips and guacamole and  a mango salsa chicken. There were no forks or knives on the table and it took another 10 minutes to get those. By the looks of the picture for this item, I believed it would be a medium sized portion. This portion looked as though it was for a small child. I ordered it with fries and steamed broccoli which were also child sized portions. I was disappointed in the portion size. The chicken and mango salsa tasted good. Chicken was cooked well and the mango salsa tasted fresh. The fries had some overly poured salt and the broccoli was good.

268,Brian S.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",73,11,,1.0,2013-06-10,"I'm usually not compelled to write a bad review about a place, but when I have the intention to bring my girlfriend to a place for a birthday dinner, as a last minute attempt to turn her bad day around, and the place makes it worst? I have to say something. It was about a week ago. I hurry up inside to let the host know it's my girlfriend's birthday and she notifies me that she will let the server know. Cool. I grab a booth immediately and the server, Randall, tells me that he knows about the birthday girl coming. We take a look at the menu and decide to order some sweet potato fries, oh you don't have anymore? Okay, well we were looking at the drinks, how about a margarita with that coronita on top. Oh you don't have anymore coronitas? Alright then, we'll just get the margaritas without the coronitas, but can you put them in those big martini glasses? Oh the bartender already poured them into mugs and you can't pour them into the glasses we asked for AND you ran out of salt? Okay server.  See, I work at a restaurant. I understand when you run out of things, it happens. But when a small request is made, after not having many of the things we asked for, and then you blame the bartender for not putting it in the right glasses because she ""already poured it?""  And on top of that they were the wrong flavors we asked for.  Food came. It was alright, nothing special. Spoke to the manager about what happened, he brings the right margarita WITH salt. Now I'm thinking, if the dessert comes with the birthday candle maybe it'll make up for everything that has happened. Oh, that's the check? Oh you forgot about the MAIN reason why we came here in the first place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday?  I figured, I'd ask him if it was busy. Maybe he was busy tonight and that's why so many things went wrong. He replies ""No, not really."" I don't even know how to summarize our visit here. In short, save your tip money for servers who will make you ENJOY your birthday dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=160,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.8200000000000003,2.72

We also ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer.  One would think making chips and a burger is pretty fast and the 2 easiest things to make. We received he chips about 2 minutes before the entrees arrived.  The chips was cold and was not fresh in any way.  When the food arrived, there was an issue with the burger which would have been a quick fix. The burger that was supposed to be plain, had everything on it plus more.  Great for a person who likes eating everything but I do not.  The waiters response to the error was that he was not sure what was going on in the kitchen and took it back.  5 minutes later, i was brought another burger that looked plain.  When I took my first bite, all I could taste was ketchup, pickles and tomatoes.  I realized that all the kitchen did was scrape off the condiments and was sent back out. Why not make a new burger.  What if I had allergies.  What if I get sick from something on the burger and that is why I like to have my burgers plain.  We called over the waiter again and advised him of the situation for the second time.  We also advised him that it is not sanitary and safe to do what the kitchen did.  Don't you think if I wanted the stuff off that way, I could have done that? Who are they trying to fool.  It was the kitchens mistake.  He once again said that the kitchen is slacking off and he doesn't know what is going on.  I asked to see a manager at this time.  The manager came by and he was only aware of the first issue.  I explained the situation and he was not really in shock or care.  He just said ok, hell look into in and offered to buy a dessert and walked away. I was in shock of the response I was given. The 3rd burger arrived. I was hesitant to touch it because of possible backlash.  It did look weird and tasted weird so after a few bites, I just ordered dessert and asked for the check. Once the check arrived, I saw something strange.  We were billed twice for the burger.  I called the waiter again.  I advised him of the new issue and he said that I was credit.  I asked him where?  He shows the the dessert credit.  I told him to look again and listen to what I am telling him.  We were charged twice for the plain burger.  He said, its a quick fix, walked away and brought me the correct invoice.  I do not recommend this place at all.  I think the kitchen is not professional and the customer service is horrible.  Taking shortcuts on making a burger because of an error the kitchen made shows no respect to customers or health.  I hope this location gets inspected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=200,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.8840000000000003,2.68

First of all we called ahead to get our names on the list since we didn't know the area or how full it was going to be. N when we got there they hadn't gotton our name down but they said they would move us up because they believed that we had called ahead. I ordered the bottomless express lunch that I normally get for the chicken enchilada soup and because we get chips n salsa while we wait. So I ordered that n the waiter brought the chips n salsa and about 5-10 mins later he brought out my salad and another 5-10 mins go by and he comes to tell me that they don't have any chicken enchilada soup. He should of informed me before I ordered! It was 3 in the afternoon that's a bit early to be running out of soup but whatever but then he starts offering the thee soups n I already know I don't like them so I ask I I can get something else meh says I can't so I choose the loaded potato soup cuz that's the only other one I sorta like n the guy brings me loaded potatoes... So I told him I wanted the soup not the potatoes so he brings the soup n it was tasteless n just bad. I didn't touch it! When he comes to leave the check I told him I didn't like the soup so he said ok that he would take care of it so in the end he ended up not charging us for my meal so that was good but then we noticed that he had charged us for the loaded potatoes he had messed up! But luckily he took that off too! So i ended up loosing my appetite with all the waiting n just one salad but the waited did handle the situation well in the end so that's why they got one star n the other on was because my boyfriends meal was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=240,3.24,3.02,3.02,2.12,3.1080000000000005

The Boulevard has so many great restaurants, that there really is no excuse for bad food. If your doors are open, the kitchen should be good or better. My college memories outperform my recent two years of actual experiences at Chili's.  The staff is very nice, but the consistency of my food is a crap shoot. Perhaps I need to only order the new menu items in order to maximize my odds of consistency. Perhaps the kitchen staff gets too lax with the items they think they can cook.  Today I had overcooked soggy tilapia with wilting dehydrated steamed broccoli. AND I'm not a picky eater. REALLY! I wish I knew how to fix the problem. We all enjoy the staff and atmosphere, but I'm kicking myself for choosing to go there today after the two most recent experiences with the cooking quality. I ordered  'medium' steaks and received overcooked AND undercooked interpretations. I realize that thickness matters, but I'm assuming that appropriate temperature and time compensations are a part of the culinary school curriculum.  So I suppose it's worth a shot to suggest checking the temperature accuracy of the ovens and stoves as well as the timers' in the kitchen .

But this Chili's felt different. It felt like the Midwest. And as it's in a shopping center full of d-bags, I was shocked, SHOCKED at the kindness within these walls. I usually go with my friend, since I don't like chains, but the last two times we came here, we were treated with kindness. Maybe it's phony, but...desperate for civility, I'll take it. For example, I only ordered a plate of endless nachos with a bowl of chili (I figured, you go to Chilis gotta eat chili, right?). The server was very peppy and nice. No ""that all you want half-pint? Thanks for wasting my precious time."" No attitude. Just a smile, a serve, and a quick ""enjoy!"" That's straight up customer service. Also, I flagged down someone who we clearly were not their table, asking for more chips. ""No problem""...I thought I'd seen the last of that person. Nope, within a few minutes, a hot plate of chips came out. So fast, even our server didn't realize it. Again, service. I really dig this place. Well trained service (nice). Decent grub. A nice relaxing atmosphere. It's been at least a decade since I've seen little kids dressed up nice to go to a restaurant (says a lot about where I eat). And it was precious...yeah, precious! to see little adults dressed to eat. Notes to AFC North followers: It seems there is a Steeler contingent that haunts this place.

LOCATION & PARKING Located on Ventura Blvd. on the Valley's Miracle Mile Encino Commons in a plaza called Encino Town Center. Personal parking lot next to Chili's but parking is also available in the surrounding lots in the plaza.  AMBIANCE & SETTING Super casual spot great for a casual date night or group outings with family or friends. Plenty of booths and seating areas. Very clean, well lit, and well-maintained. Average noise level making conversation with others possible. Several TVs throughout the restaurant and at the bar. Ziosks are on every table to make ordering food/drinks and paying the bill more convenient and efficient.  CUSTOMER SERVICE Came in for a super late lunch in the afternoon and was seated immediately by the friendly hostess. We ordered the Dinner for 2, which included an appetizer and 2 main Entree dishes. Service from our waitress could have been better cuz she forgot our Appetizer, which didn't come until AFTER our main entrees. And she didn't bother refilling our waters and only asked when it was clear that we were finished with our meal and ready for the check. My boyfriend didn't wanna bother waiting for the waitress to bring us a check, so we paid using the Ziosk.  FOOD Honestly, we really only come here for the Crispy Chicken Crispers. The other food items are alright, but not that great. If you go with your significant other, spouse, or friend, I recommend the ""Dinner for 2"" Menu for around $20 cuz you get one Appetizer and choice of 2 Main Entrees. We were SO hungry, we also got a side salad that was surprisingly huge!  Side House Salad - Fresh lettuce, carrots, tomato, cucumber, red onion, cheddar cheese, and croutons with a side of dressing of your choice. Big portion, light and healthy, and delicious! - GET IT!  Appetizer: Panko Breaded Onion Rings - Onion rings battered with panko bread crumbs. Soft, juicy onions inside and cooked nice and crispy on the outside! - GET IT!  Crispy Chicken Crispers - 5-6 pieces of Crispy Chicken with a side of Ranch sauce and paired with your choice of 2 side items. My boyfriend went with Loaded Mashed Potatoes and a side of Steamed Asparagus with tomatoes. - TRY IT!  Honey Chipotle Crispy Chicken Crispers - Waitress claims it's spicy, but it really isn't! This is my Usual every time I visit Chili's. Basically it's Chicken Crispers covered in delicious Honey Chipotle sauce with a side of Ranch dressing paired with 2 side items, which are usually French Fries and Corn on the Cob unless you'd like to switch them out. So. Damn. Good. - GET IT NOW! Overall, the service could improve on bringing out food in an appropriate sequence and in a timely manner.

When we placed our orders she asked what dressing she wanted on her salad. My wife asked for Italian. She then told us they don't carry Italian dressing. Huh??

Very nice girl working there and sadly I can't recall her name...she has dark hair with bangs and always smiling! If it helps she was working on Saturday night 07/25.

250,Kleio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-04,I used to love ordering food to go from Chili's but the last 3 time the sides I have ordered to go along with my meal has been lacking. I enjoy the chips and salsa and I also normally order the quac as well. The frist time I had full to go order cups full of the salsa ad also the quac. But the last 3 times I have ordered food the sides I ordered to go along with my food has been half full cups of salsa and half ful l cups of quac. The bag of chips are also half full and mostly crushed. I am normally in a rush when I pick up my food because of time restrants so that I can get back to work so I am not able to check my food until I get back to work so I can eat while at my desk. By that time I have no time to go back and try to have them fix the issue. This makes me very upset becuse I also always leave a tip for the person who is just grabbing the bag of food that has already been set out for them. They could at least check it and make sure that it is correct before handing it off to the customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=260,2.8,2.86,2.86,2.2760000000000002,2.836

Every time, and I mean EVERY time, I order to go food here about an hour before I pick it up, it still takes me 30 to 45 minutes to actually get my food after arriving to the restaurant. Even when it's slow. And the worse part is that all the servers see you standing there waiting and they just stare with dumb looks on their face. By the time I get rung up and receive my food I've usually lost my appetite. Sigh, it's partially my fault because I keep going in hopes it'll get better it never does.

If you are paying with a credit card you can request the check and pay directly from the tablet, so you don't have to wait for the waiter to do everything for you. Definitely a nice update!

I don't have anything against the craft and local beer movement, and am happy to see so many more beer choices for people, but c'mon - the taps at Chilis will now be all craft selections, and Bud lite or Coors lite. Maybe they'll have a Mexican brew.  You gotta have already one mass produced, good quality Pilsner or lager, and I'm sorry but Bud lite and Coors lite are not even close to Stella, or Pilsner Urquell, or even a damn Heineken. Why don't we have Carlsberg on US taps, it's all over Europe?!  What about a nice Asahi or Sapporo, or even Kirin?! Or can we have some big bottles or cans? Fosters oil cans would be fine with me.

It was bumpy so I picked it up to look at the bottom. Seriously, it looked green and gray with food scum. But mistakes happen, so it didn't really bother me. I picked up my cousins plate and low and behold, her plate looked even worst than mine. My stomach rolled. I called one of the servers and he was super nice and said he'd take care of it. honestly, no way I was going to stay there. I was waiting for someone to come by so as not to rudely walk away. I finally flag down our server and told her what happened and told her I'd not stay and to cancel our order. She was very nice and said ok. As I was walking away, another waitress, not ours, called back and asked me about the beer, as in, ""but what about the beer!"" Wtf?

29,Ernesto V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,1.0,1.0,2017-04-12,"Ventura Blvd, Encino CA Very poor service. I placed my order and when out came out it was incorrect. Which is ok, I simply told him what it was supposed to be and he went back to the kitchen to fix it. Came back out and my order was wrong again! I explained to him what I wanted, which was SIMPLE. He then argued with me and was trying to tell me that I ordered something else. His attitude was deplorable as was very disrespectful. I asked for the manager and when he came out he was upset with me as if I did something wrong and asked me ""what's wrong with the order"" with a bad attitude. I told him what I ordered. The manager then tried to clarify what I ordered and it he repeated it incorrectly. At this point I'm wondering if it's me that's the problem. So I opened the menu, pointed at the menu at the pictures and said ""I want that, and this"". The manager got even more annoyed because I did that. He finally said ok. He went to the back and brought my food over, AND IT WAS INCOMPLETE AND WRONG AGAIN! Where is the disconnect? I have no clue, this never happened to me ever. Was this a prank? Tired and hungry, I told him what was missing and what was wrong. Finally those were corrected, fine,  time to eat. I pick up my corn and it's COLD! THEY GAVE ME OLD CORN THAT WAS BEYOND SITTING AROUND IN THE BACK. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO HEAT EMITTING FROM IT! What the heck is this? Then my rice? OH NO, THE SAME THING! I told the manager I was not paying for my food. He then responded with ""ill give you a discount"" like he was doing me a favor, and he said it in a very condescending manner. He repeated to me again that ""I'm gonna give you a discount, ok""? I looked at him like ""whatever"" and was prepared to pay my tab minus a $2 discount I thought he was gonna do for me. He actually didn't charge me for my meal which was honestly a surprise. Meanwhile this whole debacle was occurring our original waiter was walking around literally throwing a plastic tray into the air and spinning it into the air and trying to catch it when it came down. Needless to say, he didn't always catch it and it would just land and slap obnoxiously loud on the floor, the behavior of a 12 year old. I mean it, that waiter behaved so childish. Who plays with objects by throwing them high into the air in the dining area? Had it ever occurred to him that he could walk into someone, like another employee carrying food because he's looking up into the air and not where he's walking? Or it could land on a customer and hurt someone?  I've been coming here for years now and things happen, I get it. Mistakes happen and they get corrected, no biggy. It's cool. But this was down right terrible.  Judging by the way the waiter spoke, unable to listen, and playing in the dining area like a child (which was very very bizarre behaviour for an adult to have at work in front of other people) he's not prepared to work with the public yet, he had the mentality of a child still. The manager? Not very well spoken, sounds uneducated when he talks, doesn't listen well either, poor attitude, and clearly a bad example and leader for his team. What you permit is what you promote. I'm a loyal patron of Chilis and have been for years. I frequent all the time. In fact my friends and family sometimes give me gift cards to Chili's because they know I go there all the time. Sadly, the only Chili's around is the one on Ventura Blvd in Encino. I need to find somewhere else to go, which is sad because I feel like going right now lol. But I can't anymore  If anyone else had a similar experience here please post here. I will be contacting there headquarters as well.

My daughter and I drove down to LA to visit my brother. It was later on a Friday evening, close to 10PM. We checked into the hotel and then decided that we were all hungry. I usually like to venture out to different places when in a new area, but we were hungry and I wanted to go to a place that I knew would be open. I found that Chili's was a few miles away from the hotel and we decided to come here. By the time that we got there, it was only going to be open for another half an hour, so we hurried in. We were seated right away, but luckily there were other people in both the dining room and bar, so we weren't the only people in there. Our waiter came around and took our order. We tried to have our orders ready, so it would take forever since they were closing soon. The food was fine, came out correctly and how we ordered it. Some people like it, others don't. It is saltier than a lot of other restaurants, but it tastes like that at all the other locations. I wish that I could remember our servers name, but he made the experience great.

I wasn't going to put up a fuss about a lousy $2 surcharge but if Chilli's has the nerve to charge people like that without telling them, they deserve all the 1 star reviews they can get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino,2.52,2.88,2.916,,2.736

Their baby back ribs are delicious , I don't know if they still have the Dr. Pepper sauce but it's sooo gooood!!  Their cocktails are really well made at this location , especially margaritas. My favorites have been the triple Berry and their seasonal watermelon margarita , super tasty! The 2 for $22 deal is pretty good , usually my wife and I don't get it because she likes different things on the menu lol but it's a great deal!  I would definitely recommend this place , the wait usually isn't long , except for Friday and Saturday nights due to the dinner rush .

Most of the bad reviews are pretty accurate since I've been to this location before with less than pleasant experiences, until yesterday. Never have I received the service Nathalie gave us. She made our experience that much more perfect. Her attitude, her service, and her overall charisma are truly ONE OF A KIND!

3,Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",265,814,3204.0,1.0,2017-09-05,Awful! This was my first time ever at a Chili's Restaurant. I had some friends who live in the area wanted to meet for happy hour. So I said sure. As I time to spare I was going back home to SD. After parking we decided to seat at the bar area. Nobody even greeted us to say hello and welcome. So we sat the bar area. 20 minutes goes by nobody coming to ask us for are drink orders or we had any questions on the menu. As it was happy hour time.  I noticed the happy hour menu. As we never got a chance to even get a glass of water.  So I said give another 5 minutes before I am leaving. Sure enough I gave it another 10 minutes. Nobody came over to take are drink or food order. At that point I just walked out and refuse to talk to a manager. When one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.  You have large private lot parking and street parking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino,2.64,2.88,2.932,,2.7840000000000003
23,Melanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,4.0,1.0,2017-09-11,"Where do I begin with this review, it was my daughter's birthday so we all decided to come to Chili's, big mistake we had a party of six 4 adults and 2 children the restaurant was not even busy, waited 45 minutes for our food, when the food arrived, my daughter had a pasta dish with shrimp, the shrimp was like ice, my son-in-law had a waffle with chicken which was lukewarm, Next To Arrive was my husband's fajitas where the chicken breast was raw and ice cold, Next To Arrive was the kids meal and my meal which was the ribs the sausage and the chicken the kids Meals were so so  nothing on my plate was even edible ribs were not even warm chicken was cold sausage was freezing, I asked to speak to a manager she asked if we wanted to have her make our food over again if we were willing to wait she said they would make it over I said we had already waited 45 minutes and got all the food cold they warmed up my daughter's food in the microwave made my husband a new chicken breast for his fajitas it came back the same way cold in the middle I ordered a hamburger by the time I got it everyone was finished eating, so I asked for it to go, there was a nasty film on the bottom of the glasses that we noticed after we drank our drinks hopefully we don't all get food poisoning as temperatures plays a big part in people getting sick I work in a restaurant, and this was totally unacceptable they should not be serving food like this",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=40,2.64,2.86,2.924,,2.7720000000000002

First impressions for this Chili's location was great. We came Sunday for dinner we don't have to wait. Our server ( Janine)  really nice and professional and the menu is improved, I love the honey Chipotle and waffles and I asked if I can order the waffles only she said no because waffles is special imported from Belgium and the dont have for waffles only in the menu.

One question: can a get a menu without the calorie count? I've already thrown ""healthy dining"" out the window the minute I walked through the door, do they have to suck all the guilty pleasure out of it by putting those numbers in my face?

4,David P.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",20,138,115.0,3.0,2017-10-09,"I used to like this Chili's better than the one in Northridge. Unfortunately, my experience yesterday ruined that perception. I walked in and there was no host or hostess to be found. I stood there looking at all the available tables thinking I would be seated right away if anyone ever showed up to seat me. The host finally showed up and said there would be a fifteen minute wait. I looked at all the empty tables and wondered why there was a wait. There were several small booths right in front perfect for a party of one. When I was finally seated I looked around the restaurant. Tables were full of plates and glasses that had yet to be cleared after the previous customers had left. The restaurant is apparently understaffed. Somebody needs to hire a busser or two to clean off tables. Chili's recently removed a large number of items from their menu. Gone is one of my favorites, the steak and shrimp with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes. All I ever had to do was substitute broccoli for the mashed potatoes and I was in low carb heaven. I realize the menu was getting too big and they wanted to simplify it but this was a disappointment for me. Except for the fajitas the menu is absent of shrimp. Anyway I ordered a smokehouse combo. Served on a metal tray the combo is offered with two or three meat selections, chili garlic bread, fries, roasted street corn, and pickles. Sure it ruined my low carb diet but their was plenty of protein. I chose the chicken crispers, jalapeno cheddar sausage, and BBQ chicken breast. The fourth option is a half rack of ribs for $2.00 extra. The fries were hot and crispy and flavorful. The chili garlic bread was good as was the street corn. I liked the sausage as the jalapenos were mild and didn't burn my mouth. The chicken crispers weren't very crispy and looked more like chicken tenders  from the kids menu than they did in the photo on the menu. The BBQ chicken breast was a good size but I was full and took it home for a later meal. The staff were running around doing there best to please the customers and were friendly and as attentive as they could be under the circumstances. I was miffed that the Ziosk table entertainment system was not working at my table. I always enjoy playing the trivia game. I was even more miffed when a $1.99 table entertainment charge was added to my bill. This was quickly removed by the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino,2.76,2.93,2.932,,2.862

10,Sam W.,"Burbank, CA",10,122,8.0,2.0,2017-10-25,"It's not a gourmet meal by any means but I happen to like Chilis Margaritas and their Southwestern Eggrolls. I used to like going to this location over other locations in the valley but recently I had two really poor experiences here, one last month and another last weekend. Last weekend I went to the Encino location around 12:30. When we arrived we were told by what we thought was the host that there were was nothing available except for one booth in the bar and we would have to eat there. There was no option of waiting for a table in the dining room. We reluctantly sat in the bar and our host is actually a waiter, then it clicked he was trying to fill his section which annoyed me from the start.  After I order a manager comes over and asks us why we sat at that table, I explained that we were told to sit there. Apparently the waiter/host bussed someone's meal while they were in the restroom and not finished. We offered to move tables but they told us to stay and so we had to eat with the other table glaring at us. If that wasn't bad enough the manager seemed to offer no apology when I said this entire experience is making me feel really awkward. Also during the end with our meal the waiter/host and a bartender were having an argument and shouting over our booth. All in all, it was one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I've had in quite a long time. I'll still go to Chilis, but this location is on a time out for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino,2.96,2.95,2.92,,2.9539999999999997

We ordered the frech fries with cheese and bacon (small $5). It was definitely not good, the fries were so dry like if they were cooked the day before.

My daughter, my grandson and I were her today to have a late lunch. My grandson was hungry and tired and threw his apple juice on the floor (he's 22 months old). I went and told the host , who was an absolute amazing person and very helpful, about it. He came over and mopped the spill up and brought another apple juice. The Mgr. Then came over and made the guy get rags, get down on the floor practically and dry it up all the while giving us a dirty look. Excuse me, but I'm paying your salary. Anyway, we had tacos and the new honey chipotle boneless wings. The tacos were good. Stick with original boneless wings if you're going to order the wings. The honey chipotle wings weren't that good. The molten lava cake and the coffee were delish. The manager definitely needs some training. I might be back but not soon. The ambiance has completely changed from 6 months ago. It just wasn't enjoyable. Waited a year before I came back with my daughter and grandson again. Service still crappy. Food wasn't hot except for the chili. Kids small meal of sliders & corn on the cob was near cold and corn tasted old. They forgot the fries but once I told the waitress she brought them-cold. Molten lava cake was good. It still wasn't enjoyable and the whole place had 4 people eating there. So my daughter loves the nachos and so, we went back. This time it took around 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Bleh still. There was 1 waitress running around for 9 tables!!! Asked for the check because zooksk wasn't working... received wrong check, then it took another 20 minutes to receive the correct check. My daughter missed her dance class because it took an hour and a half for lunch.
