132,Phil G.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,,4.0,2014-10-12,"Stopped by BJ's, the new brewpub in Short Pump. Food was surprisingly good and the service was outstanding. But, I know you are here for the beer! Octoberfest-skip, Pumpkin-tasty and reminded me of the fireballs we used to eat as a kid. Sample size was plenty, not sure I could drink a whole glass. IPA and Red-spot on for style, but not spectacular. The porter and stout-very solid, enjoyed the porter just a little more, Nutty Brewnette (Brown)- my favorite of the meal. Some of the others you could drink the sample and that would be plenty. The Brown, I could have enjoyed several. Overall, good solid beers with some worthy of having again... but shouldn't impact the local breweries in anything but a positive way... gateway craft beers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=140,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

They specialize in pizza and beer, so pretty much guy heaven or if you're like me and love pizza. My brother got their stout and I got a glass of their berry cider. Their cider was amazing! I will definitely go back just for that. The good thing is, that you can try any of their beers before you commit to a full glass.  I came here with my family and we ordered some of their bbq wings and a pepperoni pizza. Their pizzas are all dip dish style. The pizza was eh. My dad and I wished it had more sauce just to try and be a little more deep dish style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

They also have lots of other craft beers if you don't find one of theirs you like. The pumpkin, stout, and red are pretty solid. Try a Jerry Berry for a mix of their red ale and berry cider.

118,William M.,"Henrico, VA",166,85,,4.0,2014-10-21,"Well first of all, this is one of the only places that I know of in the greater Richmond area that serves deep-dish pizza. And its good. Really good. A lot of their food, in terms of concept, is very run-of-the-mill, such as grilled mahi-mahi. However, some of the other options I have never heard of and sound delicious (pepperoni pizza DIP). The beer is impeccable. Really good. Also, our wonderful server introduced me to the idea of putting a few drops of tobasco into a fireball shot. Don't knock it until you try it. This place is so great, my only complaint is that there isn't any outside dining areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
114,Mitchell S.,"Mechanicsville, VA",3,11,,1.0,2014-10-22,Seems like just another place just trying to cash in on the craft brew popularity.

123,Dave C.,"Henrico, VA",4,41,2.0,3.0,2014-10-30,Just another chain restaurant in Short Pump.  Food tastes same as any other restaurant on strip. Fries were shoe lace style which I liked. Menu had food on one page and a black hair on another.  Not a good start.  Server brought out flight of 4 beers for wife and me but forgot which ones were which.  So much for sampling new beers.  I did like the pumpkin ale and red ale once figured out.  Server was very attentive though.  BJ's has a lot of tightening up to do.  (Start with wiping menus) We're in no rush to head back.

116,Amy L.,"Leesburg, VA",54,176,8.0,2.0,2014-11-08,"Overall, I'd rate this chain restaurant as Inconsistent. As another Yelper mentioned, the menu had food residue on it. I got a wedge salad that was mostly delicious but marred by a slimy leaf that should have been removed by the kitchen.   I ordered a pizza since that seemed to be a specialty.  About 20 minutes later, a waitress (not our server) comes by holding a large pizza pan with the handle-type thing they use.  [I wonder at the time if I ordered the individual size I had planned, but assume I had ordered incorrectly.]  She sees that there's no pizza ""stand"" so she leaves with the pizza.  Several minutes pass.  She comes back with the stand and the pizza.  I ask her for a plate.  Several minutes go by and still no plate.  Now our waiter stops by and says ""this isn't your pizza"".  Then he goes off to serve another table.  So I have a pizza that's apparently not mine and still no plate.  Finally the waiter comes back to say that they ran out of small pans so they upgraded my pizza for free.  I now ask him for a plate, which he brings after several more minutes.  So I finally have a plate to go with my now-lukewarm pizza.  It's pretty tasteless anyway, but I can't take a chance on ordering something else for fear of how long it will take. In the meantime, I've finished my iced tea and would like a refill.  Our waiter isn't around and no one else is paying attention.  I go as far as to hold my glass up, somewhat out of the table & into the aisle, in the hopes that someone who works there will see.  Several servers swerve to avoid my empty glass. My son ordered a cookie for dessert - the pizookie thing without the ice cream.  The waiter sets in front of him and the next thing my son is crying because he burnt his hands on the pan.  I rush him to the bathroom to run cold water on his hands, but the water is quite warm.  Normally I would enjoy this temperature, but of course it doesn't help me for a burn. We return to the table so my son can put his hand on the drink glass with ice in it.   The waiter comes by and I tell him that he really needs to tell kids that the pan is hot.  He says he did say that.  I don't recall hearing him, but even if he did it's clear my son hadn't paid attention. The manager comes over, very apologetic.  He comps our pizza and dessert.  So at least we didn't spend a lot of money...  During our visit, I saw managers visiting other tables too so perhaps they had an off nite?  Anyway, we were just visiting Richmond so wouldn't have much opportunity to visit BJ's again.  But I think I'd be more likely to go to another basic chain (TGIFridays, Red Robin, etc.) instead of BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

The atmosphere is not bad, pretty  busy for a Monday night around 9. The stuffed mushrooms were ok, they seemed a little undercooked. I then ordered the Fried Chicken with no gravy or succotash and subbed in roasted asparagus instead. The chicken was mediocre at best, not horrible, not delicious. The mashed potatoes-white cheddar -were the best part.Both me and my best friend ordered the roasted asparagus, but it was so bad, we  requested subs-I got the seasonal vegetables-overly blanched and a little strange smelling mix of cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and snap peas.My friend got the fries, which were pretty tasty.Overall, I can see myself returning but ordering completely different.

113,Tiffany N.,"Charlotte, NC",1,5,13.0,1.0,2014-11-15,"Tonight I made my first trip into Bjs Brewhouse, I was let down a few times during my visit that I feel should be brought to your attention. Prior to my arriving at the restaurant I placed a reservation through your Preferred Waitlist, the confirmation said that I had a 40 minute wait.  Immediately after placing the reservation I received a text saying my table was ready, please proceed to the host stand to be seated.  I went up to the hostess stand and was told that they had clicked me in on accident and that my table wasn't ready, that I still had the original 40 minutes to wait.  This was fine and I had a seat.  The waiting room began to clear out to the point we had to stand when we came in and were seated by ourselves (6 of us) when we started to wonder when our table would be ready.  My friends also made a reservation when they arrived and they were told 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes at 6:45. They were told at 8 that it would be an additional 30 minutes to an hour.  At 8:00pm my husband went up to the hostess to check on our table which included two 4 year old children and was told that we would have an additional 30 minutes-hour wait and that I was quoted the incorrect time in the beginning.  Finally we were seated at 8:28 (through my friends reservation on the wait list) and we sat down and ordered, our waitress Tony was very friendly and apologized for our wait.  I received my text after we had been seated. When our food arrived 5 of our 6 guests received their meals, I assumed that they couldn't carry mine as well and that they would be back.  We continued to wait for more time as my friends ate their food and I snacked on some of my husbands dinner.  When Tony came around she checked to make sure everything was okay and that is when I told her that I never received my dinner, she apologized and went to find out where it was.  She returned with my dinner and I thanked her and began to eat.  After a few bites a manager named Luke came over and asked how our visit was going and I couldn't be quiet any longer, I expressed to him how disappointed I was with the wait, service, and that my food hadn't arrived; also that I was hungry and sharing food with my friends until my plate had arrived.  He replied saying jokingly that I had wanted to do that anyway with trying everyone else food, I laughed it off but was not in the mood after this visit.  He told us to let him know if there was anything he could do and hoped we had a good rest of our meal.   We received our check, paid and left; I was very disappointed with my first visit to Bjs and don't know that I would return or recommend it to any of my family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

When we sat down, we ordered drinks and food for the kids right away. We also mentioned we had a birthday. It took almost 20 mins for our drinks to come out. From that point on it was a chase to get anything else. At one point, one of the kids spilled a drink bc the top just would not stay on. The juice went all over the table and floor. We had to hound a bus person to get napkins for clean up. No one offered to refill the drink. We never heard another word from our server about the birthday.

Now for service. .. we made the mistake of saying we needed a few minutes to look at the menu.   Took forever for the waiter to come back.   After we finally got our order in it was close to 30 min before we got our food and it was luke warm.   We had coffee to drink as it was lunch but our neighbors with beer and wine got much more attention than we did.

Bartender was  attentive, advised us of specials, and drinks and food were received in a timely manner. On a whim, we decided to get coffee drinks and dessert, a rarity to us. The coffee drinks were made specifically, and while we drank them we patiently waited on dessert. Dessert never came, we asked about it, the order hadn't been placed, and it was rushed to us, placed in front of us, then we expressed that we had expected to enjoy it with our after dinner drinks. Dessert was promptly taken away from us and removed from the bill with an apology, and nothing else. Being familiar with the industry, guest satisfaction is a first, and to ensure return visit, management should have provided dessert or at least made a visit to apologize about the lengthy wait.

Their pizza is pretty good as long as your like bready thick crusts/dough, but I prefer their tacos. Their wings are great (not breaded whew!) and we like to finish dinner with their pizzookie desserts which are simple, sweet, hot, and a la mode! I think they need a few months of service staff turnover to weed out the bad servers and as long as their service managers properly walk the tables, check-in with tables, expedite the food properly in the window, and stay on top of order/wait times per table after seating.

We decided to try their sodas.  I had the rootbeer and the hubs had the cream soda.  Both were amazing.  For lunch, he had the brewhouse burger and I had the grilled mahi taco.  we both enjoyed our entrees.

Hopefully that desire to do better will mean that they're just experiencing growing pains. A few key points that made our experience less than enjoyable: *We utilized the Preferred Waitlist option, but that was a total fail. The hostess really couldn't provide an explanation. *We utilized the Order Ahead option so we'd have appetizers waiting for us. Unfortunately, this was a fail as well -- and our server didn't even seem to know what it was about. *My husband ordered a beer as soon as we sat down. After quite some time, he was told that the beer had ""just run out"" and they were too busy to tap a new keg. *While the avocado egg rolls were great, the dipping sauce with them tasted horrible -- as if it had been boiled so long that the pot burned. We advised our waitress that it tasted so off that they might want to address it in the kitchen before they served it to anyone else, and she said she'd have a manager come out, but that didn't happen. *While the fried appetizers & entrees, as well as the pizza, were tasty, the Santa Fe Salad was jsut blah. And I requested more dressing, in case they accidentally used ranch rather than Santa Fe dressing... but that never came either. Overall, the decor is very appealing, and some of the food was tasty, but in an area like Richmond, and especially with the large variety of restaurants in Short Pump, you must do a lot better than just good in order to succeed. Hopefully these are just new restaurant growing pains that will improve with time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.568,2.92

They give generous portions and have a great selection of meals to choose from. I personally enjoy the pulled pork BBQ sandwich which I can nearly taste just thinking about it. Their pizza also looked very tasty and ,again, portions are excellent.  The beer is also great. I like the fact that they do have their own craft beer and it is very tasty.

36,Pablo W.,"Henrico, VA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2015-11-08,"English   I will never return to this place.  I really DO NOT reccomend it.  I had a horrible experience this Saturday 11/7 at 9:30 pm and it was the first time I had ever been there.  I asked for a beer without foam and when the bartender served it the beer had a lot of foam.  It settled and was filled to about an inch below the rim of the glass. When I ask the girl who ran the beer to my table if they could fill it up a little more she walked off with a horrible attitude and and the bartender whose name was ""Christian""  just let the glass sit there for a minute and then stuck a straw in it and stirred it around to create a foam that reached up to the rim of the glass. They brought it to the table with a rather horrible attitude.  Our waitress came back after this ordeal and asked if everything was ok, I commented what had happened and that I had seen everything unfold and that the problem was still not fixed.  She went to go talk to the bertender ""christian"" and he served me another glass with the same problem.  I accepted the glass even though I wasn't satisfied but the waitress insisted on resolving the problem and went to talk to the bartender.  He just ignored her and turned around to look at me with a nasty attitude while he and a different waitress ( a tall girl with black hair who was working in the bar area that night) laughed about the situation.  I thought that the bartender would have just fixed that problem seeing that all he had to do was put a little more beer in the glass but instead he chose to ignore his coworker, who was trying to fix the problem.  It really bothered me how he treated and ignored our waitress and his attitude he got with me looking at me as if he was challenging me. The beer cost 6.50$ for a pint and that's not cheap.  I asked for it without a lot of foam and  don't feel like that is an unreasonable request.  The bartender just didn't feel like pouring a decent glass of beer and chose to treat his coworkers and clients badly instead.  As for the food, the hamburger cost 12 dollars. The french fries reminded me of Burger King and the jalapeño burger was not spicy or anything as the menu said it would be. But these are personal tastes and maybe another person would like the food.   The attitude of the bartender CHRISTIAN makes me NEVER want to go back.  I do not recommend going to a place where they can't even serve a decent beer and they ignore your waitress when she tries to fix the problem and then laugh at you with the other waitresses. Our witress who was a blond was very nice and helpful, she was tryign to fix my problem with my drink and I appreciate that. The bartender and the other waitress who was working the tables near her were the ones that ruined the whole experience at BJ's.   I will never go back because of that bartender.   Instead of just topping off a beer he decided to let his pride get the best of him and he lost a customer and I will never recommend this place to anyone. I saw the whole situation happen right before my eyes and it really bothered me how he treated our waitress and his customers. SPANISH  No voy a volver nunca mas a este lugar. Realmente no lo recomiendo. Tuve una mala experiencia ayer sabado 7/11 a las 9:30,  y era la primera vez que iba. Pedí cerveza sin espuma pero me la sirvieron con espuma y bastante, pero cuando la espuma se fue quedaba como un dedo y medio sin cerveza, cuando le dije esto a la mesera se la llevo al  bartender llamado ""Chris"" y este dejo que el vaso se quedara allí y luego metió una pajita y la revolvió para ponerle espuma, lo sé porque lo estaba mirando. Pero mi pedido era sin espuma a vaso lleno. Cuando la mesera me pregunto si estaba todo bien , le conté lo que habia visto y que el problema no estaba resuelto. Ella fue a hablar con el bar tender, me sirvieron otro vaso y estaba el mismo problema, yo no estuve muy satisfecho pero habia aceptado tomar el vaso así pero  la mesera  insistió en resolver el problema entonces fue a hablar con el bartender y este  la ignoro dejo el vaso allí y luego el bar tender me miraba con actitud desafiante mientras se reía con otra mesera de pelo negro y alta, yo pensé que el bartender iba a resolver el inconveniente pero no lo hizo sino que ignoro a su compañera.  Me molesto mucho como él trato a la mesera ya que ella trato de resolver el incoveniente y su actitud desafiante al mirarme. El vaso costaba 6,50 USD, no era nada barato, entonces pedí lo que era justo.  Me dejaron con el vaso que me habian traido que no cumplia con lo que pedí  y NO lograron resolver el problema por que el bartender NO tuvo las ganas de hacerlo.        En cuanto a la comida, pedí una hamburguesa . Me costo 12 USD, la verdad que las papas parecian de Burger King, y no era nada picante la hamburgesa, como decia. Pero estos son gustos y seguro tendran otra experiencia.

Dinner - I ordered fried chicken without the gravy  and my husband order chicken Barbados with black beans and rice. Apparently my chicken was prepared with gravy and needed tonbe re-prepared but during that tume my husband's dish sat under the heat lamp and when the food arrived the beans on his plate were dried out and unedible - definite heat lamp fatality. We called the manager and asked for the check for what we ate but didnt want the dinner. He said there were computer problems last night. Well that would account for the extremely long waits but not the quality of the food. - obviously there is no quality control at this restaurant.  The manager did cover the entire check which was appreciated but I doubt we will make the trek to Short Pump again for this particular restaurant.  It's a shame because the food on the website did look tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9800000000000004,3.2000000000000006
17,Grace K.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,6,3.0,4.0,2015-11-15,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after hearing really good things about it. I didn't realize what type of restaurant it was; I thought it was just another Kickback Jacks/Applebee's type of place. I was very wrong.  BJs has a very diverse menu and offers quite different things from a typical American restaurant. It made it very unique. Their menu was like a novel. So much to try and it all looked delicious.  We went on a Friday Night so it was very very busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. They ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. Downside to this is there is not much wait space, but I mean most restaurants don't offer a big waiting area.  Got our table ordered drinks, all good. Our waitress was very very nice and fun to talk to. The kitchen was pretty backed up so we did have to wait around 30 minutes after we placed our order.  I got the chicken pita tacos, which are similar to a Greek gyro. They were awesome, but I believe that they forgot to put the sauce on. I was so hungry I scarfed them down before I made the connection there was no sauce.  My boyfriend got a pulled pork burger. He was unhappy with the small amount of pork on it, but he still said it was very good. The French fries were good, but very small and difficult to eat. They almost tasted like onion rings to me.  We then got a chocolate chip pizookie. Only complaint there is they did not put em out Pam spray on the tin; it was very difficult to scrap the bottom of the cookie off. Other than that it was delicious.  We were there for a little over an hour between waiting for food and our dessert. Prices are reasonable for what they offer.

I've been here with friends, for events, and solo, and all of them have ended up the same way... extremely pleased!  Whether its the beer selection, great pizza, or tasty appetizers, I always leave full and happy.  I haven't dived into their menu fully because I keep wanting to eat the dishes I've already tried again.  Unfortunately, I can get stuck get the same dishes at particular places! But, I can attest that their pizza - deep dish & flatbread - are both delicious.  I also had the Sante Fe Spring Rolls and they were perfectly seasoned!   A must-have when you visit is a Pizookie!  These desserts come in full and mini sizes, well most do.  My personal favorite is the Peanut Butter Smore's Pizookie!  I also love the Salted Caramel! For beers, I like more of the pale ales, like the Brewhouse Blonde, which is always on tap. The hostess and servers are very inviting and friendly.  I always enjoy the service I receive with each visit.

They have a vast amount of beers, ales, ciders and signature cocktails to choose from. They definitely give Capital Ale House a run for their money with their IPA choices. Some of my personal favorite adult beverage selections here are the Blonde Ale and the Berry Cider.  On my most recent visit they had some seasonal berry themed cocktails in lue of the impending holidays. I decided to indulge on the blood orange pom sangria. It was full of flavor but the sweetness of the wine was mellowed and balanced with a cinnamon stick that gave the drink a hint of spice. It was delicious! There are so many unique pizza selections at BJ's. From traditional pepperoni to the sweet pig, there is a pizza for everyone. My friend and I chose the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which was absolutely amazing. This deep dish creation includes juicy chicken accented with fresh tomatoes, cilantro and savory bbq sauce. We definitely enjoyed our pie!  Make sure you leave room for dessert so you can try out their pizookie. A hybrid of a cookie and a pizza, the pizookie is a great ending to any meal. They are served hot, and sweet topped with a scoop of ice cream. My mouth is watering reminiscing about this sweet treat. We couldn't decide on just one flavor, so we got the trio of peanut butter, cookies and cream and salted caramel. Every bite was worth the delicious calories.

69,Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192.0,4.0,2016-04-01,"On last Sunday I was on a mission to have lunch at a restaurant that I had not been to before. While on this mission, I came across BJ's Restaurant. I never even heard of the restaurant until about a week ago. But how did my experience go? To find out, read below.  The Good: Menu- From the looks of things, this restaurant is like Applebees on Steroids. Their menu focuses on sandwiches, burgers, chicken, ribs and pasta. The difference in a BJ's menu and an Applebees menu is the variety that BJ's offers. The menu itself has to be over 4 pages long. Those that are indecisive might take some time to make a selection but those looking for a specific taste in food will have a better chance finding it here than other restaurants that specialize in ""American Food"".  Price/Portion- I ordered the lunch special Chicken Tenders and Fries. Yes it was a safe choice in food, but the chicken tenders were around $7.50. This is a bargain considering that at other restaurants, their chicken tender meal is sold for around $10. The portion of the food was also pretty filling for the price paid.  Taste of My Meal- As stated before, I ordered the chicken tenders meal. The food was very good. The food came out hot and I did not need to add any seasoning to my fries. I could say that I was satisfied.  On the Fence: Service- The server was friendly and more than willing to accommodate any need of the table, but there were times when she disappeared for long periods and the food took longer than I thought it would take given the small number of people inside the restaurant.  Taste of the Root Beer Ribs- I had the chance to sample a rib from someone else that ordered the meal. The meat was a little tough and the seasoning was more of an acquired taste to me. It is definitely a dish that I would not order. Overall: If you are looking for a restaurant that has the Applebees on Steroids theme then this is it. The ambiance is great, food is affordable, portions are great and my group had overall positive reflections on how the food tasted. I could surely see myself coming back to this restaurant and I would be more than happy to sample other dishes on the menu aside from my favorite Chicken Tenders meal.

The hostess greeted us right away & found us a comfy booth. The waitress came with menus right away & got us drinks! So far so good.. I order the deep dish pepperoni/spinach, cut into 6 slices vs 4 (I was told they were big) and an order of French fries with a side of ranch.. The food didn't take too long, I'll say 20 mins or so.. I was so hyped to try this & super hungry! My pizza was not hot/fresh, like at all.. I'm thinking a fresh pizza would have sizzling cheese, I would have to wait a minute for it to cool but no I was able to hold the slices as I attempted to cut them.. (Attempted, bc I only had a butter knife & it wasn't cut into 6 slices like I asked) finally took a bite & it was as if the pizza was made a bit ago, only luke warm. The French fries were the same but really taste old.. I asked for a fresh batch & a side of ranch that she forgot.. When the new order of fries got to me, I could tell they were fresh.. The grease was an obvious sign & I could feel the steam as I reached for them.. Unfortunately, they weren't all that good.. They taste like crispy air (over cooked).. No potato, just fried, crunchiness with no real taste without the ranch.. Very disappointing to say the least.. I didn't eat all of my food so I order dessert, which looked promising! I ordered the salted caramel pazookie (I believe that's how u spell it) it's basically a big cookie, with 2 scoops of ice cream, Carmel drizzle, chocolate chips sprinkles on top & a hand full of strawberries (I order those separately to add a little extra flavor) Let me tell you this was by far the best dessert.. I've had in a while! It was the right amount of crunch and softness.. It was delicious!! Presentation was great as well.. The dessert made up for everything else that wasn't right! It was so good & I was obviously enjoying it so much that the guys across from me, said they had to order the same! Lol My friend & I both order one, co spidering how sweet it was we really needed water! Our waitress seem to disappear after we got our food.. We needed refills before the dessert even got there but got distracted by the pazookie's that we didn't get to ask her before she slipped away.. I will definitely give this place another try to let them redeem themselves..

He asked her and she said well there is still some left and they don't want to tap a new keg, he could get something else or have another flat one. Couldn't believe it, you really expect your customers to drink flat beer at a brewhouse?! So he ordered a different beer and at the end of the meal asked if he could chat with the manager. He explained what happened (and noted the server and the food were great). The manager told him that he didn't taste the beer so he doesn't know if it was flat (so we are liars now?!), and said we had too much information and they don't serve flat beer. My husband walked out and as I was paying the bill  (including asking them to remove the flat beer we sent back), the manager came back and said he did go check and the keg was empty, that they should have given him a new beer and to apologize on his behalf.

128,Kevern S.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,3.0,2016-06-18,"BJ's was moderately busy in a Saturday night; we were a party of five so seating time was a few minutes as supply is limited. We looked at menus and were pretty decided upon seating. Soda and waters to drink and a quick fried artichoke appetizer. The drinks and app came and we quickly decided that the oil was dirty, as well as the dish having a few fries, Brussels sprout leaves and a tortilla chip included. It went back; nothing but graciousness from the server with an offer from a management visit. The soup, chicken tortilla, was brought, with a table side pour presentation. Hotter soup would have been better, but it was tasty. Cafe Rio is superior, for what that's worth. The table ordered two enlightened dishes, a kids burger, French dip, and sirloin. The Mahi and shrimp came out as a Jambalaya and was also returned. The penne shrimp and asparagus was tasty enough, the Mahi and shrimp was delivered; meager on the couscous and the Mahi a bit firm on the cooked side. Ok, it was dry and kind of flavorless. The shrimp had no real flair either. The spinach was more in the volume of maybe... 4 leaves worth... Further consideration led me to conclude the Mahi sauce was heavily salted.

From the moment I entered the restaurant I was greeted with care (and a gluten-free menu which helps) and felt right at home even in a chain restaurant. I do not order salmon often while out because most people (especially in a more casual dining environment) over cook it, but not here! The salmon was cooked to perfection! The vegetables were fresh and the menu choices overall were plentiful. Definitely a place to satisfy a group of people. If you have a gluten sensitivity, you will be pleased with the selection they offer. Oh and dessert! You must get a pizookie! It is their version of a cookie sunday. They feature a seasonal flavor (when I was there it was lemon blueberry. It was AMAZING!) And they also have regular chocolate chip and a gluten free chocolate chip version as well.

153,Timmy T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",272,559,,3.0,2016-10-03,"I wanted to eat a new place in the Short Pump area and my friend recommended this place. He stated he has been numerous times and has only had good experiences so I wanted to give this place a try.  As the name suggests, it's both a restaurant and a craft brew house. The restaurant itself is fairly large and is split into two different dining areas, one for the bar/smaller tables and the other side for bigger parties/families. The menu here is way too extensive. I understand that having all inclusive menu reaches a wider audience and attracts more business but some times I feel that is counter productive. The long menu made it very difficult for me to choose something I wanted. It also doesn't allow the restaurant to focus on several small specialty dishes and execute them exceedingly well instead of just average. I finally decided on the spaghetti and meatballs and my friend got the steak and fries. The food came out in about 10 minutes. The size of my entrée could definitely feed two people and I actually took half home. The pasta itself was okay but nothing great and the same could be said for the meatballs. I liked my dish but there wasn't anything special about it. The pizza looked really delicious from the pictures on the menu and I would probably get that the next time I come (if I do).  Our server was nice and attentive. Although we may have gotten a less than desirable reaction when we asked her what our total was since we had a 10$ off coupon in you spend $35 or more. She didn't even address what we just said and just kind of took off with a look like oh one of those patrons trying to see if they can get something free by using that coupon.

Their website says over 160 beers! Aside from that, they're also known for their pizza. The pizza is great, but it's a little pricey. One pizza that I ordered came to $28.00, after taxes. Smh... All the other food seems to be reasonably priced and is quite good. Definitely a step above places like Fridays and Ruby Tuesday. Lastly, I would like to mention that on my last visit there, I ordered a pizza without chicken because my girlfriend is vegetarian. Unfortunately, when I picked up my order, there was chicken on it. I understand mistakes occasionally happen and I told them that it was no big deal.

I have seen it really good and watch it go down hill in the short time BJ's has been open. I also don't like giving poor ratings, but when I'm birthday lunch is ruined...I think it is well deserved! My co-worker and I both ordered our lunches via their website/app. We couldn't pay online, which was weird but we just walked over (literally the restaurant is in the next parking lot behind my office) to pick up our lunch. She actually headed over about 10 minutes before I did and hadn't returned which was very odd. When I walked in, she was still waiting and so was another lady who had come in before me. So apparently, their sites were down and orders weren't coming through to the check out system but according to management the kitchen had them and were making our orders. We quickly realized that was a lie. We heard the manager ask about my coworker's order and they clearly responded with ""I don't have a ticket for that!"" So she waited another 15 minutes for her order. They gave her her meal for free which I thought was acceptable.  As I waited, I had to verify with the server that my order was being made. He told me it was but wanted to make sure it was entered correctly so I told him I ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad with balsamic dressing instead of the ranch it came with. And I waited....and waited...and waited. So my food was finally brought out to me and the same server who was at the register when I walked in, the who who verified my order and reentered it in the computer, had the nerve to ask me to pay for this meal!!! I had order before noon and the food was not ready until after 1230pm.i had been waiting over 20 minutes in the restaurant alone! Are you flipping kidding me!?!?!? I laughed and clearly stated I was not going to pay. The manager heard me and was at the ready to respond but I cut him off. Oh...side note if you missed it...this was my birthday...my actual birthday. And I was wearing a sash that said I was a birthday princess!!! So my statement to the manager was simple...I understand there was a technical problem with your website, I can sympathize, but I had a salad and waited over 20 minutes for them to make this salad after I walked in the door. It's my birthday and I'm not paying for something that isn't my fault and I was inconvenienced. He didn't argue, and I didn't pay.  Now for the cherry on my birthday cake... As I'm walking back to the office, face red from the irritating encounter, I notice my salad doesn't look quite right. I sit down at the lunch table in my break room and am ready to flip my lid! I have a salad with no chicken, no corn salsa and no corn tortilla chips! And you all had the nerve to ask me to pay $15 for this!!

I ordered the chicken tenders and fries and the quality was not great .  The fries were soggy/oily and the tenders just..dry and looked sad. The food also took it's time coming out and for such a basic dish(30 mins or so) and non -busy day , I was surprised. The second time for lunch, there were perhaps 12 tables of 2-4 guests and I felt terrible for our waitress. It seemed she was the only one covering all the tables. She was polite and sweet but this puts a strain on her and the timeliness of the service. On the second visit, I opted for the unlimited soup and salad which seems to maintain it's taste and deliciousness. I also really like there daily specials from mom through Thursdays.  Overall, I believe the main factors of what made this a 2 star was the quality of wait staff and the questionable quality of the dishes I've had. In addition to that, waiting for the check took a solid 15 minutes. Our waiter was very busy but was clearing empty tables before handing us the check... At this point, i just wanted to leave and find anyone to just pay my bill.  (What bugged me most was that I believed there was some form of a work meeting occurring in the dining space behind me. Although I do not know the content of this meeting or anything at all about it, I don't believe it was fair for it to occur while the staff struggles. I believe it demonstrates poor acknowledgement/consideration for staff) There was only one other worker the entire time who seemed to be the spirit of the place for that afternoon as she greeted people kindly and offered her presence to customers that helped out my waiter.

The food tastes decent, nothing life changing or anything, but it's good. My problem with this restaurant is the service. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I've never seen a group of hosts/hostesses, waiters/waitresses, and even a kitchen staff so clueless and terrible at their jobs.  I've never walked in through the doors of this restaurant to be greeted by a host. The two desks for the hosts (which are placed one in front of the other instead of next to one another, what's up with that?) are always abandoned and you'll have to wait for minutes just untill a host or hostess comes to help you. I went yesterday for dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all and my dad still had to ask one of the waitresses if there were any hostesses working.  As for waiting staff, they aren't too terrible to be honest. They are nice people but they take forever to come greet you at your table and take drink orders which is annoying. Also, they will forget any small thing you change to your order. I always order a sweet tea with an extra cup of ice and I've never gotten that extra cup of ice with my drink, which isn't a big deal, I just ask them again. If you change anything on your order though, you are basically rolling the dice on whether it comes out right or not.   And now the kitchen staff. The kitchen does put out some good tasting dishes but they are notorious for being slow apparently. When I first came to BJ's with my dad and sister, my sister warned me that if you come here get ready for bad service wether it was a hostess, a waiter, or slow ticket times from the kitchen. She was definitely right.  I most likely will be dragged to BJ's by my dad again, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner or anything, not because this place is terrible, but because there are much better places to eat in the area that won't have you leaving with a headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20,2.92,3.04,3.04,,2.9920000000000004
6,Elaine L.,"Chesterfield, VA",78,2,,2.0,2017-07-08,"The food is good, but the service is absolutely terrible. It took us an hour to get half of our tables food and another 20 minutes to get the rest of the tables food. And it wasn't busy at all! The food was good but half of it was cold by the time it got to our table. Everyone always complained about the horrible service and now I see what they were talking about",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40,2.84,3.04,3.04,,2.9600000000000004

I love the atmosphere the whole restaurant has, the beer selection is wonderful, they have the best avocado rolls and wings with so many flavors. The pizza is AMAZING, the mini is sort of like a personal pizza so I wouldn't plan on sharing that. And the best part was the pizookie the salted caramel is to die for! Amazing, restaurant.

My main reason for going tonight was for my Mother's birthday and we chose this place because of one main dish, which was no longer on the menu. Luke had the kitchen make this dish anyway. Our waitress was equally amazing. I've only eaten at BJ's a handful of times but I will make this a regular spot now simply for the way Luke made us all feel!!! Thanks for my mom's bday dinner beinf awesome!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20,2.96,3.09,3.09,,3.038
64,Phillip B.,"Richmond, VA",0,39,5.0,5.0,2017-08-20,Wanted the mahi mahi but I wanted to have a few different ingredients. Not a fan of peppers and onions. So they allowed me to pick different choices from the pizza ingredient menu. It's was awesome.  I told the server I had some mahi in the fridge at home and after the meal the cook came to my table and told me how she cooked the fish so I could try it.  I will keep coming back.  I also love the European beer choices,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20,3.0,3.13,3.13,,3.078
71,Myra Z.,"Rockwall, TX",0,7,,2.0,2017-09-15,"Food is fine , service not fine. Our waitress gave us attitude from the second we sat down. We asked if we could move to another table and she gave us a look and replied ""I don't know where you would even go "" (with more than half he restaurant empty, including the table right next to us which we chose). She rolled her eyes and seemed very impatient with us ordering. We got some dessert and that took forever coming out , that all the ice cream and whip was melted into soup, we didn't even touch it . When we asked about why it was sitting outside for so long she just mumbled something and walked away.

155,Theresa M.,"Richmond, VA",4,8,,1.0,2017-09-18,Went for the first time for dessert. The restaurant was almost empty and the hostess told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait for a table. Once we got a table it took the server 20 mins to get to the table. We ordered water and dessert. The water came 15-20 minutes later with the water. I couldn't understand what was taking so long to get water. While waiting I did see a lot of workers standing around the bar talking. We only ordered dessert and that seemed to take forever. We spend 1.5 hours in the restaurant and only went in for dessert.  That was the first and last time I'll step foot in that place. Seems like the staff could care less about the customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico,2.96,3.08,3.08,,3.0320000000000005
154,Laura R.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-08,We stopped coming here for a while because the service wasn't great and the food was inconsistent. Tried it again today. We got our meals quickly and the food was average. We explained we were in a hurry and ordered dessert and our check at the same time. 25 minutes later we were still waiting. I got up to go look for our waitress and found her chatting with manager sitting in a booth. She stopped again to chat with another employee even once I explained we were in a rush. There was confusion with our check and we never did get to eat our dessert because we were running so late. This place has so much potential but never lives up to it & the management is not tuned in. Nobody noticed that while we were waiting for a check a party of six came and sat down where ignored and were very unhappy (same waitress).  I think we are done!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico,2.96,3.04,3.04,,3.0080000000000005

I ordered a chicken sandwich with a caesar salad and it was ok. not the best. then i got a free dessert for joining their premier rewards, took 25 mins to get a small cookie and some ice cream. the service is poor and would not recommend. the only thing good about this place is the managers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20,2.96,3.02,3.02,,2.9960000000000004
141,Courtney Y.,"Spotsylvania Courthouse, VA",112,3,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Probably the worse service I have ever received. I went to dinner with 2 friends (one of which has been here before & loves it, the other has never been here like myself) & long story short, we waited for a table for over 20 min (when we were told it was a 10-15 min wait) then we were told that they ""skipped us on accident"" & we had to wait even more. One of my friends ordered a soup with her entree & we all order entrees. My friend received her soup & that was it - none of us received any entrees. We were told the systems in the kitchen went down but our food would be out shortly regardless. THEN we were told that they were waiting to cook my friend's wings & that they would be out ""in 2 min."" After much more than 2 min (and 1 hr & 40 min of being there total) we asked for a manager. The manager brought out the wings as if that would make everything okay. She said that she was told that we had already eaten & were simply waiting for my friends wings! My poor friends & I worked all day & none of us had eaten so we were really looking forward to this meal. The manager brought us all comp cards (as if we'll ever go back) & did not make us pay for anything (what would we have paid for in the first place? No food & one soup?) we were not the only customers that left or asked for a manager either.  I wish I could review the food for you, but all I could tell you about is their ice water - since that's all I had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico,2.96,2.99,2.99,,2.9779999999999998

It has this nice restaurant thing going on for it as well.  We were met by two waitresses that were extremely nice.  Hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. (I know kinda odd to order at a Brewhouse lol.) I ordered the double bone in pork chops with white cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli and we got a pzooki!  All I can say is WOW. Their food was flavorful, and tasted better than any Brewhouse I've ever went to.  They have TVs everywhere. So don't worry guys you can watch the game anywhere in the restaurant. Oh the pzooki is this cookie that comes out fresh out the oven with ice cream on top. Yum!  The bad:  The menu is overwhelming. It's nice to have choices but it's toooooo many choices. The menu is as thick as a mini book and it's not just the pages that are thick. Lol. You feel like you don't know what to choose and pressured to order. Other than that, it was good.

When she returned and my son asked for the chicken sandwich, she left again to ""check if they had any."" When she finally came back she informed us that they only had ""pizza, ribs, and salad."" I'm not sure how their supplies got so low during a one day snow storm. We then decided to leave.
