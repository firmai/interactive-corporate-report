49,Eric C.,"Graham, NC",1,30,,4.0,2012-03-01,"Lately I've been a fan of local burger joints, not chains. But, I've had two great burgers in a row from Red Robin, so maybe this place is good after all. The last two times I've been to Red Robin I decided to get their special burger. This time it was the Big Melt Bacon Cheeseburger and last time it was the Oktoberfest burger. Both were very good. They serve thick patties, the burgers are juicy, and they are a bit greasy (which I like). The chefs at Red Robin's headquarters seem like they really put in some thought when creating a new burger. They choose cheeses that work well, the right type of bun, and condiments and ingredients that complement the burger. The only other thing I've had off the menu that wasn't a burger or fries was their onion rings and I liked them. Their fries are just OK, but they are unlimited and the burgers are priced pretty well (at least the specials are). My big 'ol bacon cheeseburger with unlimited fries was $7.99. I'd go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

42,Andrea P.,"Burlington, NC",12,50,,1.0,2012-11-01,"Now, let me say this, I love the food there, and I have eaten there time and time again. My 5 year old LOVES it and normally eats really well for us, but this one experience has totally changed my opinion of this place... On October 19, 2012, my husband and I went in for lunch and ordered 2 Tavern Doubles (their 6.99 burgers) with 2 sodas...I presented my RedRoyalty card to the waitress with my money for the bill. I normally pay with Credit, but this time I had cash, so I used it. Well, I had a free burger on my Royalty card, BUT when she brought me my change for the order, she brought change for the ORIGINAL AMOUNT, not the amount after the free burger. I left her a hefty tip as it was in addition to the money she pocketed from my payment.  I just discovered this information after going to RR last night and looking at my bill and it said that I was still so far away from my next free burger (which I felt was due at any time). I looked on the RR website to view my card history and I saw that I had a free burger on that day, and was very disturbed by the fact that this waitress had pocketed my money. I am now waiting on RR to contact me back to resolve this issue.  I just hope that they don't hire these types of people normally and this was just a bad apple.  Other than this one person, one bad experience, most of our experiences at Red Robin have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington?start=40,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

We were sat right away, and our waitress was very nice. Our sweet teas arrived quickly.  I ordered the avo-Cobb-o salad and a small stack of onions rings. (I know, I know-but they have really good onion rings!) My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger. The onion rings came out quickly and were delicious.  Our food took a little longer. My salad was huge! Grilled chicken strips were on top of a huge pile of lettuce, with all the other ingredients in colorful sections of the salad (tomatoes, hard boiled egg, bacon, avocado, black olives, etc). It also came with two ramakins of salad dressing. The salad was really good. I was only able to eat half of it, so I hope the other half will last until lunch tomorrow. My husband enjoyed his bacon cheeseburger. The waitress was attentive but not pushy. She got our check quickly, and a to-go box, and she even offered us a sweet tea to-go.

Despite being crazy crowded, we were seated fairly quick for a Friday evening. Our waitress Charyssa was not having a good day even though I didn't see her waiting on a ton of tables. Maybe she was new or this isn't her day job. She brought half the meals, but gave them to the wrong people in our party. By the time she realized her mistake, I had already touched what I thought was my burger, and she proceeded to give it to its rightful owner. Is that allowed? ""Hope you don't mind ketchup with that!"" My party was all cool about the switched dishes but Charyssa should have been more apologetic. We didn't see much more of her. My Diet Coke glass was so empty, the manager who was trying to help out thought it was a water glass. Usually the food makes everything better but most of us were less than thrilled with our meals.

The projected wait time was not as long as they thought which was good. We were seated and greeted promptly and drinks were ordered. I opted for the speckled lemonade. My first lemonade was gone in no time and was happy to see that our server was attentive and the refill came quickly. I ordered the sautéed shroom burger. The mushrooms were delish! I upgraded to sweet potato fries.  I would say the overall experience was just average. The server was not very attentive after the first drink refill, which left me kind of annoyed that I spent 4.49 on a drink that wasn't being refilled in a timely fashion. I got the impression that our server was trying to move is along, as she brought us the bill well before our plates were empty.Our served failed to ask if we wanted dessert and my friend stated that had she been asked that she would have ordered.

I had trouble keeping it together and the bread didn't hold up to the job.  The side of fries served in the metal ring were ok , but were not crisp , I think the moisture from within killed them.  The side of fries someone else ordered as an appetizer, and not served in the metal ring were much better and maintained their crispy exterior much better.

I'm sad to say I actually planned this stop, I've been thinking about stopping here since I first saw it 5+ years ago driving from the mountains to a meeting in Chapel Hill. I make the trip regularly and there is a definite appeal to a good burger and a craft beer.  I did not find anything appealing here tonight, let me explain why.  - I was the only person in the bar at 8:30p on a Thursday and the staff was actively cleaning around me. - I sent back my wedge salad because the lettuce was brown on the edges. The second one was edible but dull. - My burger was warm but not hot and the fries were definitely not fresh. HOWEVER, this made it much easier to resist the free refills on fries. - the sign says ""Gourmet Burgers and Brews"". I guess I was expecting more than one craft beer on tap. They only had the mediocre Red Oak Amber. - I do not like having waitresses under the age of 60 call me ""hun"" or ""sweetie"". - the bathroom wasn't clean.

We stopped for a late lunch here at RR today, it was my first RR experience. it all started ok but as it went on it got weirder and worse, our screwy waitress ""Crystal?"", I am still trying to figure out what went on, she seemed out of it. She could not remember what we ordered as we ordered it and afterwards too. It took about 30 minutes before we got food and it was the wrong order. Took it away and we waited again, when the food arrived the burger wasn't hot, was dried out, and overcooked, it was terrible. The meat for the burger was terrible, gray, thin, and dried out. The fries were not hot, were dry, and not crisp. The tomato slices were green gassed tomatoes, not ripe (you can get better produce especially in the south and at the end of June). And the salad wasn't all that either.  I had eyed the manager earlier but never got his attention until our second order of food came, the manager came over and asked what was going on. I said ""I don't know I am still trying to figure it out"". The manager then replaced the waitress and waited on us himself.  We arrived before 2:00 pm and left after 3:30 pm, It took over 1.5. hours for us to eat and get back on the road to come home and the restaurant wasn't even crowded on a Wednesday afternoon.  The manager ""Eddie?"" comped our meals and gave us a $25.00 gift card. I still don't want to go back. If I owned this restaurant I would replace the wait staff, the kitchen staff, the food supplier, and then start over.

We ordered and then proceeded to wait for 40 minutes before receiving our food (group of 8) when it came out it was also cold and we were all very hungry. 3 people in our group ordered either a salad or a wrap, so what's the excuse for the long wait? On top of that, the service was bad and not even a hour after finishing it 2 people in our group (1 salad and 1 wrap) felt sick and still do today.

We were in the general area on a work related matter & decided to grab a burger for an early lunch - all our lunches tend to be early. We decided on a Cup of Chili ($3.59), a Burning Love Burger (Topped with fried jalapeño coins, salsa, Pepper-Jack, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll, cost $10.79 including FFs), and a Crispy Chicken Sandwich for $9.99, also with FFs. The house made Chili came out first, and it was delicious - very meaty, with some zip. This is the same chili they use on their Carolina style cheeseburger, and it should be just right.  The Burning Love Burger was one of the best ""spicy"", gourmet style burger we've tried, and it was huge. It reminds me very much of the Wild Thing Burger at Top Dog in Rodanthe. The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was as good a fried chicken sandwich as I've had, and it also is a two-handed monster - I brought half home. The FFs are the large, steak fry style, but were perfectly cooked, and full of real potato taste. We would reorder either of the sandwiches in a heart beat! The service was flawless - orders quickly taken, drinks refilled, to go boxes furnished, as was a drink to go cup. The sandwiches here are a bit pricey, especially at first glance.

Good thing I looked before I sat because the booth was soaked with water. I stood there for about 5 mins to see if anyone noticed me still standing. To no luck, I had to go track down a random employee so they could dry the booth seat. (At least they clean their booths right?). The waitress seemed pretty much rushed and it felt as if she was rushing us. She sped through the menu and questions that were asked as if she didn't want to be there. She did great with getting refills before the tea got watered down. The appetizer (voodoo fries) tasted great. It was very spicy/hot and went along great with the ranch. The bottomless steak fries were cooked to perfection. Not too soft, not too hard with a great flavor. I got the burning love burger and it was ok. It was supposed to be spicy and bold but the flavor hardly came through. I didn't take a sip of water once, that's how flavorless it was. It was a pretty large burger and you got a good proportion for the price. I might return in a few months because the prices were very reasonable.

Over the last two years I have visited the location a few times and it has consistently been an awful experience. From really poor service, dirty floors, to horribly inconsistent food.   I've had to send the same burger back more than once because for some reason they cannot cook a well done burger. I've never, on the first try, had a well done burger from this location. Today three of us ordered well done burgers and all three came as medium. Sent them back and when my burger came back, after 15 minutes, it was a shade above rare with blood oozing out of it. Manager was less than apologetic and seemed to be used to this level of quality. There was zero shock.  I called customer service and they read a bland apology script and repeated parts of it word for word in our conversation.  Don't waste your time at this location. You can get a better tasting burger, for less elsewhere with better service. Update: Red Robin sent me this message and then never followed through about contacting me. Replied back to Jen K a few times.  Awful service in store and awful service from corporate. What a shame:  Thanks for taking the time to share your review with us, we appreciate your feedback. It sounds like we missed the mark here and we'd like to follow up with you. Please send over your first and last name, email address/phone number so we can connect directly. Thanks for the help!

13,Mark M.,"Roswell, GA",11,57,15.0,5.0,2017-02-11,Stopped here twice for lunch this past week while traveling back and forth to Virginia. Great service. Clean. Food was spot on. First visit I had the basic Red Robin cheeseburger. On the return trip I had the pepper burger. Both were perfectly cooked to medium. Tower onion rings were great and bottomless fries are always good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
22,Ben B.,"Sewanee, TN",11,52,7.0,3.0,2017-02-11,"This was the first time I had ever been to a Red Robin. We were craving a good burger and decided to give it a try. Our waiter was friendly, the food was good no complaints. Not the best burger I have ever had, but leaps and bounds above the fast food guys. A bit more expensive, but worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
16,Tiffany S.,"Graham, NC",178,4,2.0,4.0,2017-02-23,Was very good here. Service isn't the best and I do love that they will make you gluten free fries separate from the regular shared fryer they use! That was awesome! I love the gluten free buns and The staff was nice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
11,Brian S.,"Danville, VA",27,16,7.0,3.0,2017-02-25,"This was our first experience with Red Robin. The location is very convenient to our activities.  The menu offered a variety of choices to suit everyone's taste. My wife was able to get a turkey burger the way she likes it. The food was great, and the bottomless fries made sure everyone was full. The only thing that kept me from giving more stars was the service. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or extremely busy,  or a combination of the two. We wait ed a little longer than expected for refills on drinks and fries.  Otherwise this was a really good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
8,rob p.,"Hillsborough, NC",0,22,,1.0,2017-03-05,"Wow, this franchise has really gone downhill.  I remember when they 1st arrived on the scene - excellent portions, reasonable prices, great beer.  Now the portions are tiny and the prices are so high.   I think they've just turned into a big corporate-run franchise taking orders from headquarters... no individual restaurant is suddenly going to break-away and start offering larger portions, tastier buns or monster burger patties.  So I will tell you that their $14 bacon & blue cheese burger with a ""cup"" of soup was a joke.  The burgers are tasty, but very small.  And the ""cup of soup"" looked like the soy sauce dish at a sushi restaurant.   Myself & son, 2 burgers, water only, no apps, no dessert = $27 (tip not included).  #StillHungry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
12,Clint A.,"Burlington, NC",0,26,15.0,4.0,2017-06-29,Burgers are very good.  Love the additional flavored sauces!  Bottomless fries and seasoning is a hit.  Service has always been good and prices are on par with competitors..    would recommend and eat there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
10,Taylor A.,"New Bern, NC",1,16,2.0,2.0,2017-07-30,I have to start with the fact that the burgers are always awesome regardless of which location you go to. That being said the service is always different. At this location the manager took our name and size of the party and put our names in their iPad. The manager leaves to do manager things and the young and clueless hostess comes out and seats everyone who comes in after us. When we spoke to her about the confusion she said she has to seat people in the order that they get there. I'm glad this hostess isn't in charge of anything important like someone's life because they be doomed. Disappointed. Oh...and the waitress was great...but the hostess was horrid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
9,Matthew B.,"Snow Camp, NC",0,9,,5.0,2017-08-27,A must go to restaurant. A very well ran establishment & always clean. Customer service is always great. The decor inside makes the experience even more enjoyable. Some of the best menu choices for a known gourmet burger restaurant. This location is very good for the shopping center around it as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
3,Christy M.,"Charleston, SC",125,276,847.0,2.0,2017-09-09,"This location's service was mediocre at best. We had put in an order ahead of time with some specifics for our team etc. When some of those specifics weren't followed (like no onions), we got answers that were more annoyed than anything. My salad personally was very watered down and dirty and the girls weren't overly thrilled with it, which is abnormal for teenagers and burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
0,Erik S.,"Greensboro, NC",87,211,198.0,3.0,2017-10-06,"It had been a long time since I'd eaten at a Red Robin, but I joined some friends at this location over the weekend before we moved on to some other activities. My impression of the place... everything is really expensive. It all tastes pretty good, but it's just very high priced for a burger and fries joint. If you peruse their premium burgers menu, you'll find entrees that run $14. Regardless of a burger's toppings, unless you are using some kind of very special meat, it should never be that expensive (in the south, at least). Once you fall back to their ""normal"" burgers, you are still greeted by entrees costing at least $10, which is more acceptable but still high. They justify part of this expense by making the fries ""bottomless"" so you can fill up on those to your hearts content, but honestly, that's a misdirection. I'm also annoyed that they are charging $3 for a fountain drink or tea, a greedy practice by corporate chains that is becoming too common. For my part, I had their smokehouse burger, which is topped with pepper jack cheese, grilled mushrooms, an onion ring, and barbecue sauce. Very tasty and messy, but I wasn't let down by the flavor at all. The fries are the ""steak fries"" variety, which is definitely my preference. They are great with some of the seasoning sprinkled onto them, the jar for which is on the table. To summarize, you'll be happy with the taste of your meal here, but unhappy once you get the check. There are many great locally owned burger joints in the triad area that will leave you more satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

2,Meagan C.,"Galax, VA",51,6,,4.0,2018-01-05,"The Red Robin is the best we have ever visited. The food is always flavorful and delicious! Service is usually good but consistent with a chain, meaning it can get slowed down if busy and depends on who is working. We rarely have any issues with service or food at this location. We recently did the order to go and our food was perfect and exactly as ordered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burlington,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
