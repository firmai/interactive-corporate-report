D. H.,"Hendersonville, TN",17,258,192,4.0,10/30/2017,"I only go to a Red Robin once or twice a year but I always make sure to go during the month of my Birthday since they give you a free gourmet burger with your RR card. Since my wife also has a Birthday the same month as me we rack up by visiting a Nashville area RR every year. Red Robin offers guilty pleasure food of a considerable quality in my mind and this location has been good to us for the past two years. Great burgers, bottomless fries, awesome milkshakes, onion ring towers--it all hits the spot and though we waddle out stuffed it's worth it at least once a year. Our recent visit to this location was great and the service was fast and super-friendly. If you need comfort food I can think of few chain locations that excel as well as Red Robin--this location in particular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
Joseph H.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,,2.0,12/31/2017,"What a terrible, frustrating experience.... Our family of 4 is new to Nashville.  The plan was for this to be a regular lunch spot for us on the weekends, as we had frequented the RR in our former city (Wichita, KS).   Compared to that location, this one was terrible.   We really should have left before even being seated.  The hostess was discourteous and did a poor job in handling the order of the parties.   Other families of our size arrived later and were seated before us.   And it really wasn't busy at all!   Once seated (in a half-empty restaurant ~1P on a Sunday!), the service was incredibly slow.  The food arrived cold.   The presentation was frightful.   Our drinks stayed empty.    Beware:  If you generally love RR (like we do), be sure to skip this one!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
Michelle S.,"Franklin, TN",0,3,1,1.0,9/26/2017,"My husband and I love Red Robin. We've been to this location a few times and have had okay service and have always wanted to give it another try. After the 3rd visit over the course of 6 months, we now know how slow and poor the service is. We were seated promptly which we were happy about, and it was probably because the place was not busy at all. Plenty of room was left in the restaurant. We waited about 30-45 minutes before we received our food. Our server Robin was busy with other tables and didn't even ask us how our food was when we definitely were not happy with what we received.  Both my husband and I ordered burgers (with pink in the middle) and garlic fries. Our burgers came out fully cooked through, no pink and the buns were cold. Our fries came out shortly and sadly, they could hardly be called garlic fries. There were a couple strands of shredded parmesan and about 3 leaves of parsley on the 5 individual steak fries we received. The fact that we are paying extra for garlic fries to have them come out and be a sad excuse for garlic fries was very irritating. When we were going to let the server know how we felt, we used the ziosk to call the server and waited 11 minutes before the server even engaged us and decided we just wanted to leave. We almost walked out because the service was so bad. I'd like to think we are pretty gracious and patient people and this place tested both. We were finished with having to deal with the poor service and paid for our food via the ziosk and left.  Will link a photo of our ""garlic fries""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
JLY J.,"Nashville, TN",153,17,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Came with my son for an after-Christmas lunch, waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, but no one came to our table. When I flagged down the hostess and asked for our server, she said the server just got there and she would send her over. Waited and still no one. Started to leave and a server who was waiting on another table looked at us and put her finger up and said, ""wait I'm coming"". Sorry, but a server doesn't get to tell me to wait until she's decided to come over, after we have waited 15 min and no one greeted us.  Asked to speak to the manager (who turns out to be the person who seated us) and all she had to say was, ""sorry"" after we wasted our time. Told her we were regular customers but we won't be back after this. Very disappointed with how the service has gone down in the past few months.

Dayana V.,"Clarksville, TN",15,96,192,2.0,6/5/2017,"Stopped in Friday afternoon, around 2-230. Place was not too busy. We were sat promptly and waited a little before being greeted. Our server Jacob was far from great. He was full of excuses and was not attentive at all.  I think we asked 3-4 times for a side of ranch. Ended up having to ask another server for it. Jacob kept saying he was going to busy with his next table, so Merry was going to be helping him. Helping is an understatement. When our food came I asked for a side of honey mustard which ended up being brought by someone else as well.  The one thing is our drinks did stay full. Food was alright. All of our burgers tasted like lighter fluid. We ate half of them and tossed the rest. Caesar wrap and fries were the only things that were good.  We've stopped to eat here multiple times and never had this bad of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville

Robin B.,"Nashville, TN",7,113,45,3.0,4/23/2017,"Red Robin gets points for bottomless fries.  Typical large chain with an extensive burger menu.  My complaint is with the fact that I ordered a veggie burger and they brought out a regular burger.  I did make a point to repeat my order since I wanted the veggie option. Before you lay into me about why I'm at a burger joint and don't eat meat, my friends wanted burgers so I was along for the ride.  Of course with everything on the burger I took a bite before realizing they had brought a beef burger.  When I pointed it out, they made me another burger but by then my dining companions were finished eating.  And they charged me for the wrong burger.  With two types of veggie burgers and several options for them on the menu, they should be able to bring out the correct one.  So that's my ""beef""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
Sandra C.,"Charlotte, NC",32,181,602,1.0,7/24/2016,"Worst restaurant ever! Twice I've been disappointed, won't give another chance. 1st time, wasn't informed until an hour in that they were out of my son's entree choice.

Kristi O.,"Plainfield, IL",391,410,1452,4.0,3/18/2015,We stopped in for lunch Saturday 3/7/15.  We like to sit in the bar if possible as we are usually wanting to watch sports.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was a nice gal.   I ordered the simply grilled chicken sandwich and opted for bottomless salad w/ salsa and their rather tasty bbq sauce for my sandwich.  Yum!  The diet pop was flat... :( I like Red Robin and wish there was one closer to where I live b/c there are so many other options when dining in Nashville.  My boyfriend had some sort of deal so that's why we stopped- we probably won't revisit until I get my free bday burger next mth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
John T.,"Franklin, TN",88,162,304,4.0,2/22/2015,"The only two reasons I didn't give this place 5s are one its a chain and two (which is petty) the waitress didn't bring me more campfire sauce with my fry refill.  That being said they have good burgers with a good family atmosphere and reasonable prices. You can't beat their steak fries, which is the real reason I come here. They are one of the lower priced gourmet burger joints with loads of toppings to add and they make a good lettuce bun for the lower carb conscious people.

I normally am not a burger person so I ordered the avo-Cobb salad. It was simply delicious. My daughter and I shared our meals so I was able to try the A.L. Peppercorn burger and fell in love.

Mandy C.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Prices go up for same food. Not worth it much any more. Just a big chain to exploit. Portions get smaller, price goes up. My heart goes out to a few of their servers. They have some good servers. May be a few who are high on themselves, especially a young short skinny one with long hair. Seen she treats other servers like crap but is sure favored by gm. Food is usually good but prices keep going up. Too bad servers get crap led on by owner or gm.

P D.,"Clarksville, TN",0,10,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Have been eating at RR on and off for over 30 years. Very disappointed in how far RR has fallen. It is really a high end fast food establishment and no longer a service restaurant. The staff do not service the table unless you call them over. Had to call the wait staff just to order. (About 15min) We received the incorrect drinks, had ordered a well done burger but received a medium rare (bloody center). This was removed and replaced with no accommodation. I am writing this at the restaurant table and I see we are being billed for the uncooked burger that was returned. This was corrected but with all the other errors it made for a bad ending. Of the 4 meals we ordered 3 were good. The chicken sandwich, chicken strips and southwest salad were good. The burger was not charred as a good burger joint would cook. RR has had great burgers but I think those days are gone.  Between the long waits of no service, poor service training and mistakes with orders I just can't give them more stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville
Marie B.,"Nashville, TN",104,196,437,2.0,6/2/2015,"I was disappointed in this Red Robin location. The floors were slippery, bathroom was filthy, and food mediocre to say the least. Apparently since it's a franchise each location is definitely not all the same. I ate at the Red Robin in Mt. Juliet, TN. and it was a five star review.  Many of the staff looked miserable and had the look on their faces like- I hate my job & ready to go home. On the other hand our server was nice and friendly but got two of the orders wrong. I don't eat hamburgers often but when I do I have to eat them with onions and fries. I ordered the sweet potato fries since I had them last week and they were perfect, not the case this time they were burnt and had that old grease taste to them. My burger was was hot but a little on the dry side.  The two stars= my godchildren got their bellies full and fell asleep on the ride home.

Beth G.,"Nashville, TN",470,369,645,3.0,6/20/2015,"We love burgers, we love meat. We went here out curiosity. How does this place keep people coming back? Burgers were ""OK"". Please remember we make the best burgers ever, so we are biased. The bottomless fries would be attractive, but for us not needed.  We had a coupon come thru the email so we went. Server, can not remember her name was very good. Parking easy. Clean and fun place to visit. The price for other burgers were a bit higher, but I don't know if they were justified. Not sure I will go back to see if the price equals the increase in toppings. Burgers to us mean seasoning the meat, not the toppings. 12 -14 dollars for a burger seems a bit steep in Nashville. the 6.99 special warrants the bland meat burger. Plus the fries and the service and easy parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville

Food was not very good the avocados on the Avocado Burger were  half black. The waitress asked how we wanted our burgers a little pink or well I ordered my burger with a little pink came out very well done. When I said something to the waitress about it she looked at me and said I told him pink and then turned around walked off. I did not visit the restroom but my mother did and came back to the table and said that it was very disgusting. I asked about a manager the waitress said he wasn't there.

This is a great restaurant to hang out with friends and enjoy a good burger and drinks.  My friend and I were having a girls day out and decided to stop here for lunch.  There are so many good things on the menu it was hard to decide.  We both change our minds a few times before we ordered.  We started with the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini sticks.  I love fried mushrooms and these were great.  I had a Guinness to go with my lunch.  There is a large selection of specialty beers.  I had trouble deciding between Stella and Guinness but Guinness won that day.

Sarah B.,"Franklin, TN",170,376,502,2.0,1/10/2015,"I've visited four different locations of Red Robins in the past couple of years, and I've visited this particular location at least three times according to my yelp check ins - which I may or may not always do. This location is good, but consistently not up to par with Mt Juliet or Murfreesboro, and even Knoxville one time when we were driving through. It never feels really clean when you walk in, and the servers are never great.  Last night with a group of girlfriends were were a 4 top in the bar and our server was Heather.  Heather let drinks run out three times (cocktails, no less, where the tab would've gone up), and was just generally slow.  We ordered desserts that did not look like the photos on the menu (not huge deals, but the chocolate cake was supposed to have strawberry sauce on the bottom, and didn't... and the red velvet cake was supposed to have a drizzle of strawberry sauce on the bottom, and it was COVERED).  Being the one who got the soppy, sweet strawberry red velvet cake I wouldn't like to have discussed it (not good, by the way, ignore the photo yumminess), but by the time she came back it was a mute point. Then I ordered hubby a ""to go"" burger where after saying ""no fries"" - she convinced me to order a side salad since I'd be charged for a side anyway.  Imagine my surprise when I got home and there was no salad.  Not a huge deal... but really? I hope the slight decline in this location isn't indicative of Nashville West, because I really like this shopping center and it's so close to my office.  But if you're craving the ""yummmmm"" - you might consider driving a little further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=20

Paul K.,"Nashville, TN",110,628,552,4.0,10/27/2010,"Several years ago while traveling with my future wife (wife of the future) we stopped at an exit somewhere in Ohio with a restaurant I used to eat at in New York that she had never heard of.  I was concentrating on locating the restaurant as the road was being worked on, there were strip malls to the left and right, and traffic was Ohio Traffic. Suddenly she screamed, causing me to instantly do the ""oh crap where's a place to aim the car for when we get hit"" head jerk followed immediately by noticing we were not about to be injured by a rampaging dump truck and ask her what the hell she was screaming about. It was a place called Red Robin.  It's now a staple in our West Nashville diet and we eat there whenever we have a notion to (which is when it's not crowded and we're in the mood to walk out comatose). Their veggie burgers are good, I've never been with someone who said their meal wasn't good, the shakes I love with a passion befitting a slightly larger chub chub than I am, and the fries...  well, the fries... some people don't know how to do them right, these are generally the people who think the fries are nothing special.  Get yourself some mayo, ketchup, and whatever pixie dust they give you to sprinkle on the fries - mix it up in a delicious mishmash and you should have the fry-sauce.  You will need this where you're going, which is to Downtown San-Fryliciousness. Beyond that, dunno, the place is pretty nice.  I've never had bad service there, I can't comment on the non-veggie burgers, just can say the veggie ones are done a-ok.  Never have been when it's packed as, well, I avoid popular things at popular times as I find I'm generally annoyed when everyone zerg-rushes a place I like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40

Just one issue the manager working the door at lunch.  We wanted to sit in the bar to get away from all the ankle bitters and there was an open 4 top in the bar.  The manager said, ""NO, we have people waiting for that table.  If you want to eat in the bar you need to sit in the bar....""

Dae R.,"Madison, TN",0,39,,1.0,8/4/2013,"I have gone to this restaurant with several groups of people, on vastly different occasions. The food was good (mostly), however the service was crap! On just about every occasion the wait staff has been rude and uncaring about the service they are providing.  For instance, when I went about a year ago with a friend/co-worker, the server was very quick to come and take our drink orders. However she rolled her eyes and huffed when we didn't immediately know what we wanted to eat...we'd only gotten seated 5min prior to her showing up. During this same dining experience, our  table order took 30min to get from the kitchen. Our seats weren't directly facing the kitchen, but I could see well enough inside the area to note the plates/baskets sitting out to be grabbed by the servers. Our order had been sitting out for at least 10-15min., so it was lukewarm by the time it got to us. My second experience occurred 8 months later, and was just as bad! I went with a group of family and friends. We did have a large order, so we asked for a little more time, which was granted. 30min no one had come back to ask if we were ready, and our drink order that had been put in before hadn't arrived. After we did get out drinks and put in out food order, it took another 40min to get out order, which came back either wrong, missing parts, or both. When this was pointed out to the server, she went to the kitchen to get our things. Some stuff was brought out, and some wasn't. In fact, some of our food didn't get to us until the end of our meal, and when this fact was brought up to the wait staff, they pretty much shrugged and charged us anyway. I would definitely understand the screw-ups and long wait time during busy hours. However, there's only been at maximum 20 patrons filling the whole place each time I've gone there. To add insult, there were tables that came in after us that received food well before us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40
Gail D.,"Nashville, TN",5,30,2,2.0,9/3/2015,"I've just returned home after eating at Red Robin and having my ""birthday burger"". I wanted to warn folks that they now have a new computer sitting on each table. If you decide to play with said computer while waiting on your food, etc. you will be charged at the end of your meal a $2.19 ENTERTAINMENT FEE. When I asked our waitress what this fee was she said she had no idea and guessed it was for the new computer sitting on the table.  It also can take your order and you can pay your bill through the machine. As I was redeeming my reward you supposedly can do that too on the machine but it wouldn't work for me and the waitress had to do it for me.  The computer did however tell me that my tip was higher than my ENTERTAINMENT FEE. My opinion is that I should have been warned before I touched the computer that I would be charged instead of seeing a fee added onto my bill at the end.  I won't be back.  Happy Birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40

Jenn Z.,"Nashville, TN",137,111,23,4.0,3/1/2012,"Red Robin was a favorite of mine growing up in So Cal, typically where we would go to gather for a Birthday or some sort of get together mainly because they offer so many different burgers! So I was excited when they expanded to Nashville, and at Nashville West to boot since I love this shopping center.  I was a long time fan of the chicken burgers, have had almost every one on the menu each one is a hefty serving and delivios now that I am not a meat eater, I opt for the Gardenburger. Red Robin will put pretty much any topping on your burger you have available, so dressing it up is easy.  Wait....I am forgetting the bottomless steak fries! Yes, you can have bottomless fries for your entire visit! Although a single basket is typically enough, we have on occasion ordered a basket as an appetizer and you aren't charged extra. They have their own seasoning salt at each table as well that adds a bit of kick to them and is just salty enough too.  Recently they changed some items on the menu but the staples are there, and they now have wraps and salads. You can order any burger or sandwich lettuce wrapped, and have melon as a side (cantaloupe is one of my faves!). They also started offering sweet potato fries for an up-charge, I ordered them and my first batch was cold, but the waitress kindly brought me a hot fresh order. They were okay, but nothing I would order again, I will stick with the steak fries next visit.  The kids meal menu is one of the best I have experienced while eating out, they actually have options and side items that include healthy salads, oranges, carrots and melon and each are reasonably priced including a drink.  Overall if you are looking for a very family and pocket book friendly option for dinner, this is a great place. You not going to experience grass fed local beef, local artisan cheese and buns from the local bakery, this is a chain but its' still good eats.  I have always experienced excellent service at this location as well and will return again and again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40

I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger, which is always cooked to order. They have a huge variety of burgers, and they'll customize to whatever you want. Substitute away! They also serve a great chicken tortilla soup. I love the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade.

I had a burger, which was good, but not spectacular.  The endless fry gimmick sounds neat in theory, but how many fries can the average person eat, anyway? Maybe people with kids and/or competitive-eater spouses appreciate that kind of thing a little more.  The service was good - pretty quick for a busy lunch hour.

Sarah C.,"Nashville, TN",129,281,134,4.0,3/20/2011,"As the birthday looms in the horizon during the month of March the only thing I look forward to is the free burger from Red Robin! As part of their loyalty/rewards program during your birthday month you get a free burger with unlimited fries. The free sundae and embarrassing song birds around your table is optional.  Tonight, I redeemed my free burger and I went with the classic Red Robin burger. A straight up patty with all the fixings plus Pepper-Jack cheese. Service was fabulous and I love how generous they are with their food. I never visit an walk out craving more food for a good 5 hours. Tonight as always, our server was attentive and prompt with our order. The burgers range between $8-12 and can be customized however you'd like it. Another perk is they offer for you to take your drinks to go, everything besides alcohol which they do serve! I even saw an ad for Happy Hour specials from 3p.m.-6p.m. and 8 PM to close Monday through Friday! Apparently, happy hour is available in the bar only but specials on drinks run from $2.50+  and apps start at $3.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40
Brandon W.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,3,4.0,5/10/2015,"Decided to try it while me and my girlfriend were out the other day. From the beginning the waitress was telling us how it's the best burger she's ever eaten and how there's nothing on the menu she didn't like, but she obviously doesn't get out much. It was a pretty good burger but most definitely not the best I've ever had. I decided to try the garlic and cheese seasoned fries to go with my burger. It cost a little extra for them as opposed to their normal fries. The only difference I see in these fries and the normal ones were that they shook some kind of cheesy garlic seasoning on the fries, which doesn't really make them special and doesn't really justify the extra couple dollars, although they did taste okay. I also decided to try one of their special sauces, which cost an extra 75 cents. So they brought me out a little cup of this sauce, kind of like a barbecue bacon ketchup. It was actually pretty good, but they really don't give you enough of it. When I got my burger nothing was wrong so everything came out of the kitchen correct. It was pretty good but definitely not one of the best I have ever had like the waitress was saying. I might go back but it would have to be like a second or third choice kind of thing. Overall I think that the restaurant is a decent place to eat and the never ending fries are kind of a neat thing, but its not my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40

Kenzi N.,"Clarksville, TN",101,189,1,4.0,1/8/2011,"I have eaten at this Red Robin three times now.  The first two times- we had great service (in fact, the second time was the best service we have almost ever had anywhere).  This past weekend, it was awful.   1.  I went to have lunch with my husband because I had received a free birthday burger coupon.  I was kind of excited because the previous time we had went for my husband's birthday and they made a super big deal about it (balloons, singing, dancing- you name it).  My birthday isn't usually the biggest deal, so I was a little excited.   2.  We get there and it is packed- but we still trudge on to eat our delish burgers.  They then cram us into this tiny 2 person booth that is almost inside the kitchen.  It took our waitress almost 20 minutes to come to us, and then another 10 to take our order.  It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out (meanwhile others who ordered after us were getting their food), and while we ate, she maybe came by once to check on us.   3.  The food itself was ehhhh- my fries seemed cold and the burger itself was a little burned.  At the end when we asked for the check, she says ""well- you get a free sundae for your birthday- you don't want to have us sing to you, right"" and gives me a look- a look that says she will poke my eyes out if I dare ask her to sing to me.  It made me feel awkward and personally I don't think someone should have to ask to be sung to.  Either it happens, or it doesn't.  I guess I was just hoping to have a special experience.  Another 20 minutes later she brings us a sad looking (thankfully free) sundae that is about 1/2 way melted (guess it had been sitting out a while???).

Josh B.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,1.0,4/10/2009,"Beer and wine sales tax ripoff: The Red Robin chain has decent, but overpriced, burgers. Their ""unlimited"" steak fries come-on is a ruse. You get precious few fries with your burger, and when you order more, it takes forever for the next serving of fries to be delivered to your table. So long, in fact, that I found myself having finished my burger, and ready to pay and leave. However, the biggest ripoff of all is the way they charge for and tax their beer and wine. I ordered a 20 oz mug of beer, which my check priced at 5.99. However, there was an additional ""SALES TAX"" charge for the beer of $1.45, listed separately from the sales tax charge for the food. $1.45 is almost 25% of the $5.99 beer, which means that the beer is almost $7.50. I've never seen separate tax for alcohol at any other pub or restaurant here in Nashville (or anywhere else in the US for that matter). I've asked several bartenders at other places about this way of charging tax for alcohol, and all say they've never heard of it being done that way. The restaurant ought to be upfront about it and mention that the cost of the 20 oz beer is actually $7.49 ($7.50), not $5.99!!!!!!
