The bartender Micha was one of the rudest people working in the food service industry. Complete negative personality and sucked the life out if our dining experience. She literally could not be bothered to look up at us. It was painful to see her work knowing she probably would rather be getting a root canal. It was uncomfortable asking her for anything and even more awkward having to leave a tip for someone that caused us to leave in a bad mood.  The food was ok... nothing more but probably would have tasted better if our server hadn't put such a bad taste in our mouth to begin with. Hate Pepsi products! Tea was cheap and weak. Micha almost dropped my husbands chicken fried steak and the bread fell off and instead of apologizing or anything she just mumbled ""That'll take a few minutes."" She obviously forgot about it but my husband was so aggravated with her attitude he didn't even ask her about it. The other staff seemed too comfortable- talking really loud and about personal issues when it was so quiet and slow.  I would go back because we do like Chili's but if I saw Micha I would get a booth.

36,Ed S.,"Fort Hood, TX",12,114,6.0,4.0,2014-08-16,"A Chili's! To me it seems odd, but its been tough to find sit-down spots that are NOT burger joints.  So having a Chili's on the Post is nice, and due to it's proximity to where I've been staying I've already come in a couple of times. The staff here has been very nice, and helpful. Admittedly, they had some missing ingredients for the margarita's the wife wanted the first time, but the staff was great about coming up with (an admittedly superior) alternative. Food was great! I've been in now for specials and regular menu items, and everything came out quite well.  Drinks, tougher to call. If you like the hard drinks, this place has great options (obviously margarita's). Beers, a bit weak, though maybe I'm being harsh here. There's just not many options..particular if you want to avoid the Big 3 names (Miller, Bud, Coors), like I do. They DID have a regional Texan beer though, which was awesome, so I can't take too much away from them here Really, this is a good option for anyone, particularly on-post.

The food is always very tasty as well.  On this day, my husband enjoyed his chicken crispers which were sweet and tangy. Our appetizer hit the spot as well which was the panko breaded onion rings. I had the Mango-Chile Chicken which is usually delicious except on this day. The rice had a strange plastic taste to it. Also, the broccoli had very visible mold spores throughout (posted a photo of it.) I'm sure the front of the house service would have been more than happy to swap it but unfortunately, I lost my appetite. This is the only incident I've ever experienced with Chili's throughout the years.

4,Kayla C.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,7,1.0,1.0,2015-03-27,"This was the first resturant my family and I visited once we arrived to Fort Hood base. When we first arrived we got sat immediately! Our waitress was very nice and brought out drinks and appetizers very quickly! Not to mention the place wasn't even half full with people. But after seeing 3 tables get seated and receive appetizers my husband and I started to wonder where's our main courses (chicken salad,burger, chicken strips, fries)? We had to ask the waitress, which she apologized for the wait but said it would be right out. Another few tables receive their main courses that arrived after my family and I. I then asked to speak with the manager. needless to say I think of myself as being a pretty patient person as I have worked in an restaurant establishment for 6 years myself so I understand things happen. The manager came over although she was nice, she wasnt very apologectic. She admitted that the cook messed up our ticket and the kitchen was backed up. I expressed my displeasure and how I felt as though for us waiting 2 hours we shouldn't have to pay for anything. She said she understood, she had our dinner boxed up to go which the salad was so welted...it looked disgusting. ...but before we left our waitress brought us over a bill with our drinks and appetizers. Sadly we paid it with no fight and left a waitress a nice tip. This restaurant is sad!!! I would have considered giving them a second chance but having to pay anything after waiting 2 hours for a freaking burger and salad in an empty restaurant is ridiculous! Watching other people arrive after you and leave well before you with full stomachs! I don't normally post bad experiences because everyone and every place has an off day ...but this restaurant is not customer satisfaction orientated!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003

13,Jolanda W.,"Honolulu, HI",76,2,,1.0,2015-05-27,"First day in town and wanted a good salad. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is a pretty consistent menu item that packs flavor with some good leafy greens. Unfortunately, this Chili's failed to deliver on a staple menu item. No avocado on the salad and both the ranch and Santa Fe dressings were watered-down with very little flavor. To top it all off, the tortilla strips that were sprinkled on the salad were stale.

12,Precious J.,"Arlington, TX",46,273,861.0,1.0,2015-06-22,"So.... I decided to try this location because I did not want to fight the traffic to get back on post (really wanted Pho but hey). I am not a Chilli's fan and have not eaten at on in..... I have no idea how long ago. First, I want to thank the faithful Yelpers who rarely steer me wrong but my curiosity and hunger took over this time. I just wanted a good, tasty salad and didn't want to go to Food Court. Anyway, from entry the lady was nice and seated me quickly but why not it was 11:00. Now, a big clue is when Soldiers are not swarming a restaurant (sign to stay away) but I figured it's a Monday and still early and didn't think twice. The place smelled like sour mop and I absolutely hate that smell but I stayed. Before I was taken to the booth I went use the restroom. I was attacked by a fly on the way there and inside there were two rolls of industrial paper towels not sure why they weren't placed in the dispenser???!!  So I sit and order, the waitress was nice and attentive. I ordered water with lemon and the Santa Fe Chicken salad. The fork and knife was wrapped in a napkin like usually but after unraveling the napkin, I noticed the fork was dirty so I walked up to the bar where the waitress was and asked for a new set of utensils. So, on first look the salad appeared appeasing. After running in this Texas heat this morning and skipping breakfast (not intentional) I just wants to eat. Well, the grilled chicken was nicely seasoned and looked good but was not cooked. Some pieces were pink in the inside and others tasted like undercooked mush. I decided to eat the salad itself. The spinach tasted as if it was not washed properly. That fly who attacked me near the restroom had now followed me to the table. I was annoyed, did not finish the salad, paid and left. Now you may ask why not say anything.... I did not have time to wait for another salad to be prepared, I did not feel like discussing the issue with the manager over an $8 salad at a place I will never revisit.

No problems there. When I arrived, It was not ready at the time prescribed. The bartender gave me my order and I left the store, only to get all the way home and discover my order was not correct. My Order of FULL SHRIMP was missing, and steak overcooked. I ordered medium and it was well done; no pink in the center whatsoever. I called the store back to inquire about my missing item. The server who answered the phone was laughing, and said ""oh, I just found it. Are you coming back to get it?"" I said of course. Then I arrive back to the store to get the rest of my order, and the doors are locked. So I had to call the store again, to have them bring my food to the door. And to top off the night, I get all the way back home again, and I discover I only have a half order of shrimp. It is quite clear additional training is needed at this location.

Moral of the story, unless you're desperate go somewhere else. If all else fails be prepared for a mediocre meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

I've made the mistake one too many times of ordering from this location, rather then the one off post, due to pure convience. Thankfully I've come to my senses and refuse to eat here. My husband ordered a tea to go with his meal and it tasted like someone put a dirty dish towel in it. When we asked for a new tea the to go person started arguing with him over the taste of the tea. Another time, my husband bit into a metal shard in his fish and I asked for extra tomatoes on my salad, but ended up with none. One thing you don't want to do is mess with my tomatoes, lol. The tables are always dirty when we go in and none of the employees look happy to be there. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra fifteen minutes off post.

They fired almost everyone at this store and it is ran by all new people which you would think was a positive thing. They even updated the the exterior to try and attract new business but you can't cover up snotty attitudes, poor food, and an unwillingness to help a customer. Called in to place an order and they wanted to give zero effort in trying to accommodate to my requests . I get it some things can't be done but don't have a snotty nose little brat ask me if I want her manager to tell me the same thing because in her tenure she hasn't seen it done and refuses to figure out a solution. Never once was there a sorry I can't do that or any type of sentimental acknowledgment to my request. When you spend over forty/fifty at a local establishment you kind of expect to get a little treatment. If you want your food slapped on a plate by all means step up and be the NEXT guy. I prefer to look for restaurants where the fifty I spend was worth the 2-3 hrs I had to work and be away from my family. I'm easy to please and logical btw so this wasn't a dramatic to ploy to get something free or be unreasonable.

After a long day in planes, I just wanted a good steak and a cold beer, one would think that in Texas, that wouldn't be too much to ask. This place is horrible. Sunday evening at 1830 and the bartender decided to clean the bar, moving all the bottles to the bar top, literally right in front of me. The TV had Cartoon Network on, perfect for a bar? The bartender said ""ya I don't know why it's on"". So change it maybe? I got chips and salsa, or I should say, I got a bowl of salt with chips in it. Couldn't even eat them. I ordered the ribeye which comes with mashed potatoes in a skillet and broccoli. Perfect! The meal took probably 45 to come out, I was one of like 5 tables in the place so not sure why it took so long. The bartender came out with the steak alone on a plate and the skillet of potatoes. She said "" the broccoli isn't done yet and this was sitting there, I'll bring out the rest later"". Um... Ok Roger that. The potatoes were like nothing I have ever had before, I almost bagged them to bring home to patch a small hole I have in my Sheetrock. I wasn't sure if it was instant potatoes gone wrong or just some bi-product of the instant potato processing factory, mixed with cheese or paste or like glue or something. The steak was pork, I think. Or beef, I have no idea. It was white, but I'm not sure what it was because the layer of ""seasoning"" they cake it in. I was able to put down about 1/3 of it, the rest was just a fatty mess of white salty meat-ish stuff. The broccoli never came either. I just payed and left, defeated. Never again.

We ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas, and got something that looked like  cheese soup with sliced onions and green peppers in it, we had to search for meat....Then they brought us more cheese.???
