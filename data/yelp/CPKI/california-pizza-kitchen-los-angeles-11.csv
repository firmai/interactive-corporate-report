Vicky Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",294,492,171,3.0,1/3/2012,"A two-hour delay + Gate change = Dinner at the airport and drafting session of a Yelp reviews on my iPhone $10 for a prepackaged Chinese chicken salad. I wanted to cry a bit when I handed the cashier my card. Sadly, the price was comparable to the other airport salad options.  The salad consisted of lettuce, crispy wontons, shredded carrots, sesame seeds, diced chicken breast, and a sesame dressing. I appreciated the chicken-to-lettuce ratio. I had about 1/3 leftover dressing. I guess avoidance of fast food guilt was worth the inflated price tag, although...French fries sound pretty good right about now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Angela M.,"Atlanta, GA",791,1752,1991,2.0,2/27/2012,"Let me preface this review by saying that I hate flying into/out of LAX.  I hate that there are such limited options once you're through security - CPK, McDonald's, and the ""mexican"" bar.   With that said, CPK is still my favorite place to eat in terminal 5.  $10 and 10 minutes for a personal pizza isn't all that bad, even if the staff isn't terribly friendly.  The prepackaged salads scare me since I'm not sure how long they've been sitting there and they don't look terribly appetizing, even when I've seen them with the lids off and all mixed up by other patrons. I like the selection of beverages - yay for Naked juices - even if they seem expensive even after accounting for the airport markup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Isaac Z.,"Fallbrook, CA",44,121,376,2.0,2/20/2012,"I know this is airport food and all, but the angry cholo guy working the register at CPK was doing just the bare minimum.  Lol. Customers were looking around for drinks, utensils, and napkins... He would motion with his eyebrows when they asked him for help. He used no words at all. Too funny!  10 bucks for a crappy cheese pizza. Only reason it got 2 stars was because it was hot. My advice is to just starve until you get on the plane. You can always eat endless peanuts after takeoff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4991,2341,4479,4.0,10/10/2011,"Am I invisible? The bartender next store at the brewery is always helpful and friendly, but the table servers treat you as if you're not even there! The food is solid, good, and delish.  It's made to order, and served nice and hot.  The seating is kind of weird -- wrapping around the back, but it also shares seating space with a brewery.  You can order a pizza from one of those tables, or better yet, order from the counter and take a seat. So, I am a fan of CPK.  But, on August 17/18... After a very difficult decision and deliberation, the winner of the ""1st airport pizza place taste-off"": Wolfgang Puck slams CPK! Crust (WP 5.0 a perfect score, CPK: 4.5; sauce (WP 4.8, CPK 4.0); toppings, flavor quality and quantity (WP 4.8, CPK 4.0); selection (WP 4.0, CPK 4.5). Primary judge Randy Berger says ""Delicious from the very first bite. A kiss on the cheek to Mr Puck."" Sorry no hard feelings CPK LAX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Steve A.,"Reno, NV",44,132,29,2.0,5/3/2011,This photo goes with my review of another CPK in LAX. I uploaded the photo before I checked in. Stupid me.  When I tried to check in I was told I was too far away. Hmm? Why can I add a photo and not check in????,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Suzy V.,"Miami Beach, FL",9,104,23,2.0,3/23/2011,Ehhh... The counter girl was mean.. Prison cafeteria mean... The pizza was ok Too pricey for a small personal pan pizza But hey is the airport!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4425,2442,5446,3.0,12/18/2011,Pretty standard pizza but probably the best food in terminal 6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Heather F.,"Austin, TX",773,1000,690,2.0,6/2/2011,Like most chains that open up a place in airports this California Pizza Kitchen at LAX isn't worth it. Don't waste your time with breakfast because it is overpriced and not tasty. Half the time I have coughed up the $10 for a personal pizza here it has been burned on the bottom.  If you want to add extra toppings like mushrooms to your pizza it costs $20 and adds more cook time. Service is sub-par even for airport standards. It is a shame this place carries the name California Pizza Kitchen because it doesn't deserve it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Andrew S.,"Brisbane, CA",308,328,19,3.0,2/21/2011,"Stopped by here during a 1-hour layover at around 9 PM. They serve single portions of their popular pieces, but out of the 10 or so pizza selections you can choose from they ran out of the about half of the pizzas (even my favorite Thai Chicken Pizza). I decided to go with the Pepperoni Pizza. It held up on it's own. Expensive, but what can you expect from airport dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Q L.,"Richmond, VA",16,456,40,1.0,11/2/2012,BBQ chicken pizza.....food poisoning...trapped on a plane for 5 HOURS.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,3.0,7/25/2009,"Located in United's regional terminal, this California Pizza Kitchen is very small.  Smaller versions of their pizza are served here (limited variety available) as well as a few ready-to-go, pre-packaged salads. There are a few high tables with bar stools, but the seating was comfortable enough.  Service was pretty quick (this could be due to the fact that this CPK is pretty far from the frenzied main United terminal).  The pizza (a mushroom with pepperoni) was fine and a perfect size.  You could do worse at an airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,2.0,10/22/2010,DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST HERE. It was just too many flavors going on in one meal. The bread they added was just too much. and overpriced for the poor craftsmanship.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11
