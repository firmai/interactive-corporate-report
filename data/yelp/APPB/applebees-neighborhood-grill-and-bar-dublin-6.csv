Candice F.,"San Francisco, CA",6,104,192,3.0,10/13/2017,"Food - meh, pretty good in its class at a good value.   Service - don't expect much more than one water refill.   If you're coming to Applebee's,  expect your typical chain restaurant offering the standard American fare in a packed environment and sub-par service.  We stumbled into the restaurant shortly before the evening rush on a Friday night.   We were quickly greeted and seated.  While we were given traditional paper menus, we found that Applebee's has fully leveraged an electronic tableside ordering system via a tablet.   And hence the waitstaff has probably been cut by at least 50% as everything from food orders to payment to hailing down help from the staff is dependent on the tablet.  Applebee's has certainly done well in implementing the technology, but there is still a desire to have human interaction behind a friendly smile.   Once our food order was placed through the tablet, it did not take long before the food arrived. Aside from a minor oversight from the kitchen, everything was prepared hot and as stated in the menu.    There are no complaints as far as flavors and serving sizes as everything was prepared satisfactorily.  For the price paid (especially the 2 for $20 meal deal with one shareable appetizer and two entrees), one can't really expect too much.   All in all, Applebee's deserves a solid 2.5 stars (rounded up) middle of the road rating.   It couldn't be too bad judging by a packed restaurant and full waiting area of eager diners as we exited at the end of our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6

I had to get a manager to take my order then he left for the night and I had to get another manager to refill our drinks.  We actually never had a real server tonight.

No refills from her and the service was crazy slow for only 4 other tables being occupied.  I finally found Jennifer and she was sitting having some deep conversation for 20 minutes with a customer as we waiting for our boxes and bill?! Horrible Service!! She must have gotten offended that she didn't know her stuff when we asked? Like ol girl, find another job if you're not good with people!!

Michael F.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/6/2017,My first time being to this location of Applebee's and I have to say it is the worst one I have ever been to. The service at this location is terrible and really poor. Can't believe anyone would even come to this Applebee's at all. The food here is ok do not get me wrong but if you get a man named Jorge as your waiter immediately ask for someone else because he is very disrespectful and mean. I do not know if it was just this certain day or not but he was really being mean and very dry with me and my friends.

Naima-Natalia C.,"Bay Area, CA",28,34,11,1.0,5/5/2017,"I went with my family to Applebee's to have dinner before our movie. Being a vegetarian I found nothing on the menu to accommodate me but the pasta. The pasta comes with bacon and chicken so I asked the waiter to please take the chicken and bacon away. So when my food comes the chicken is gone but there is EXTRA bacon.  There is zero sympathy atApplebees for those who do not want to eat meat. Very upset! UPDATE:  After posting this review, I was sent a harassing note from an employee. Telling me they don't have to accommodate to my diet and to go somewhere else.

Victoria J.,"San Leandro, CA",5,47,68,2.0,4/3/2017,"Oh my goodness I do not know where to even begin! Please beware of this restaurant solely due to their customer service! It's pretty sad and pathetic!  So my husband and I come in on a Monday afternoon, and it was pretty slow. So there was no one at the host station which was fine and made sense since it seemed slow. Then a sweet waitress with her hands full sees us and immediately puts her plates down and seats, and she was super kind and had excellent customer service skills!  However it was our wack waiter, he was arrogant and stuck up! I felt like we were getting punk' or something...it was very clear he didn't want to be there and our presence annoyed him!  First of all he didn't make eye contact with us at all and he seemed irritated he had to serve us. When he brings us our drinks, I told him we would like to order an appetizer, and he just stared at me and I was like ookkk, can I please have chips and dip please. He just wrote it down and walked away! It was so weird! I never meant a waiter where I felt like I was talking to myself and basically asking myself questions! So when he finally brought the dip it was horribly too salty and the salsa was blank and gross!  However, I would like to add our main entrees were pretty decent because my steak and shrimp were pretty darn good! But My husband ordered the quesadilla burger and it was sadly soggy. Finally we ordered the brownie bites and that was pretty good too.  Also I was considering speaking to the manager about the lack of customer service our waiter had, but when I saw her dancing to the music and signing and hanging out with her employees I figured what the point was if the standard seemed low and she didn't seem to care since it was her hangout time in front of the customers!  Lastly, he brought us our check and didn't even offer us if we wanted something else like dessert?! When he came and brought us our dessert he sort of threw it on the table. My husband was real irritated with this guy and so was I! Like what's the point of you working here and trying to serve us?! This place seriously needs a reality check and is not just some random bar that is a hangout spot!  Sorry this is the last time we will be coming back here and everyone else should run too! Not unless your desperately hungry and there is no other choice! Trust me people this is a last resort! We definitely will not be coming back here and that's a fact!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6

Formulary food and scripted service don't excite us.  My two visits have been on Thursday evenings around 9pm. Our group has been 4 and 8 diners, all with separate checks. The servers have always been friendly, accommodating and never complained about the separate checks.  The food has been decent. No, not gourmet, but not slophouse either. Always hot, flavorful and as advertised.

My fries were good.  Overall a very disappointing meal.  Waitress was nice.  Will not be going here again, ever.  Kids had eaten in Applebee's down south and said it was great....well, not here unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6
George F.,"San Ramon, CA",3628,1079,6015,2.0,4/20/2015,It's Friday night 10:15 pm and late night food choices in the Tri-Valley is very limited.  Option (1) speak into a speaker box and drive up to the second window and get your dinner wrapped in paper or in a box. Option (2) Get insulted by the Naan Nazi's at Shalimar Option (3) Go to Dublin and choose from Lazy Dog Restaurant 40 min wait Option (4) Go to Applebee's no wait open till 1 am across the shopping center from Lazy Dog Restaurant. Wound up with option 4. It was the Pre-Yelp for me since the last time I had set foot into Applebee's and it was as if time stopped and it was eerily familiar. We were seated right away even though the place was relatively busy. (must be the millions well spent on advertisements). We were given two menus each along with the drink menu and the dessert menus as well a electronic tablet on the table. The tablet was on the blink until our server changed the battery pack.  We looked at the drink options and ordered the mango lemonade and the Corona Rita with a Tequila Casedores Reposado upgrade option for $1 more. The drinks were excellent and the highlight of the meal. plus stars Food choices for the night were : Chips and Salsa Shredded Pork Nachos Crosscut BBQ ribs Chicken tortilla soup.  All off the pub menu choice of three items smaller plates $12.95.  All were equaling BAD! The Chicken Tortilla Soup which per the server was newly made but came last was terrible. The Cross Cut Ribs still had cuts of bone and grissle from the band saw used to cross cut the rib.  Minus stars Service was good. And with the new tablet you can pay and get out fast.

Literally just looked at us until it was too awkward for us not to say something even though she didn't greet us at all. We asked for a table for four and she walked us over. First thing she does after we sit is ask the waiter if he ""wants us"". He said something along the lines of this table being somebody else's responsible. It was made very clear we weren't a priority and that we weren't wanted. If it was just before close I would understand but it was still early and we were being treated as if we weren't even there.

Amanda B.,"Goshen, NY",242,3,,1.0,4/23/2017,I work as a server myself and I have to say that my experience today was just god awful. My husband and I stopped in real quick for just some appetizers and it took almost an hour from start to finish. I understand if the kitchen is backed up it might take a little while but the place was hardly busy. Our server seemed to be in his own world wandering around the place aimlessly. He actually forgot to bring us water! I made eye contact with him and that seemed to remind him. Than another 10 minutes for a cherry limeade that not only had a gnat floating on top but was half melted leading me to believe that it was sitting around for a little while before he brought it over to us. Food finally came out and my salad had cheese even though I asked for none. Too hungry to wait for a new one so ate it anyways. Asked for more sour cream and had to remind him two more times before actually receiving it. He actually walked over to us midway through our meal with a burger asking if that was ours. Were his customers! How does he not know that we didn't order a burger!? Every table of his seemed irritated and I certainly don't blame them.

The wonton tacos were good and we should've stopped there, everything else was just a tick below ok. Oh watch out for the little game thingy on the table, as soon as you touch it it adds $2 to your bill even if you don't do anything with it.

J T.,"Dublin, CA",1,49,,2.0,1/30/2016,Ate at the Dublin location for dinner.  The food was ok. But.  The service needs training for customer listening and managing tables.   First issue was we asked for a seat not in the bar area because we have young kids so of course they seat us next to the bar.  A booth was available but was reserved. Then we see them seat a couple that had come in 10 mins after us.  I guess buddies of theirs.   Second the waitress disappears and we have to flag someone to get her to come back just so we can get drinks or even the bill.   The bill was even wrong charging us for an adult dessert when we ordered the kids sundae.   Don't think I'll be going back as there are better places to go to around the area that provide better customer service like the nearby Black angus or red robins.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=40

The House Sirloin was small, dry, overcooked and full of gristle.  I left more than half on the plate. The ""sauteed"" mushrooms were either raw or burnt, depending on the bite. I got only a fork with my salad but the lettuce was chopped so coarsely I couldn't fit it in my mouth. When the steak arrived, I only got a knife and had to rescue the salad fork to eat. Roundly ignored by all the wait staff when I wanted water, or utensils, or more tea,  I should have been more mindful of the empty parking lot. Obviously the locals have caught on. There were only seven people at tables when I arrived on a Friday evening -- and then I saw that three of the seven were actually waiters watching TV because there was nothing to do.  The wait staff out-numbered the clients while I was there. Again, this was a Friday evening.

It was my first time ever at Applebees ( chain restaurants with names like Applebees or Mimi's or anything like that just never appealed to me )  We were seated pretty quickly, but it took them sooo long to take our order.  Half the time the waiters / waitresses were just sitting on the bar and talking to each other...  They didn't have very good communication with each other either, because they waitress would keep on saying I will get your server for you etc. etc. but then she would just end up taking our order.  I hate when people do that... if you are so unorganized try to at least hide this from your patrons.   We ordered the fried green beans, buffalo bites, and wonton chicken tacos.   The fried green beans are delicious !!! Too bad they only come with like 15. The sauces they came with ( a horseradish dip & a more vinaigrette type of dip) did not taste very good to me, but my friends liked them. The green beans were salty enough to me anyways that I didn't need dip.  Be forewarned this dish is 920 CALORIES. really? where do these calories come from.??  Buffalo bites were really vinagrey and not spicy at all even though we ordered spicy meh..  The wonton chicken tacos looked really good on the menu, but they looked so lonely and sad on the plate.  They are really small, and not really worth the price.

Months ago, the last time I was in, I left a note on the receipt about the poor service from our waitress Mercedes, and last night when we went in she didn't even apologize, but instead all she said was ""Wow I haven't seen you guys in awhile, thanks for your note last time"" and continuously kept glaring at us the entire time, acting extremely childish and immature.

There were seven of us, including my 3 grandchildren.  The service there was so pleasant, positive, welcoming and non-judgmental that I cannot thank them enough.  Children were welcomed. The food was delicious (I had the grilled pork chop and bacon and cheddar friend potatoes with steamed broccoli).  The broccoli didn't sound good but it certainly was delicious!  We were so tired, especially the children, and it was just the pick me up we needed to make it home (one more hour).  Thank you Applebee's Pleasanton.  Your kindness and delicious food are much appreciated!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=60

Molly M.,"Livermore, CA",156,314,69,2.0,12/30/2014,"What can I say? It's Applebee's. This establishment has been around for years, but not nearly as long as the one in Livermore. This one is quite a bit newer than it's neighboring locations, and I think the service is also better as well. But that doesn't say much in comparison to Livermore. Our waitress actually forgot about us for a good 20 minutes. We didn't really mind because it gave us time to talk, but for those of you who are hungry and ready to eat, you might not want to sit in the bar area. Normally I don't come to corporate chain restaurants like these, but my friend and I were looking for a place with decent dessert at a relatively good price. We ordered the simple blondie brownie with ice cream. Not bad, but not great. We didn't eat it all, and just ended up talking there for hours lol.

When one walked by us close enough to touch and carefully averted her eyes so as not to make eye contact, we got up and left.  We are a fairly presentable older couple, and we tip well, but apparently we didn't look acceptable enough to serve.

Let me begin when me and my PREGNANT wife drove all the way to pick up a baby crib to Costco from South San Jose because San Jose ran out and the only one available was on the Tri-Valley. My PREGNANT wife and I had not ate because we were trying to beat Costco closing time. In our way back we decided to stop at this Applebee's Biggest mistake of my life!!!!! . When me and my PREGNANT wife were seated the hostess took our drink order and got us our drink.. After 20mins seating down nobody had check on us and I asked the hostess if someone was going to take our order. She said that the waiter had probably forgot about us because they were super ""busy"" BUSY!!!!! that place was half empty!!!!! Then the Manager came took our order. Food took 40 mins to come out. Our food was cold and your should of seen my ""Steak"" it looked like a meatball.  The hostess were rude and lazy!!!! There was 3 hostess in the front just chit chatting!!!! If the waiter was so busy they should of helped him with orders instead of walking back and fourth just chit chatting!!!!! Then when we were eating nobody ever checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Hostess and waiter would just walk back and fourth. I would try to make eye contact to ask for help but once they would see me they would turned the other way!!!!! Once we finished eating I put  my debit card on the side of the table to pay and get the hell out of their. No bill was ever brought for another 15mins finally I called someone and told them to charge my card because I had to leave ASAP manager came out apologized and said meal was on them because we never saw a waiter. I guess they saw my pregnant wife and I were annoyed. I give the manager 5 stars for handling the situation right. But she needs to put her crew on check or trained them a bit better.  Also people behind us were annoyed. They went off on one of the hostess and some guy kept on chasing them around the restaurant for service.

He sends them back asking very nicely to have them put chedder like he asked initially. She does the whole ""OH NO, MY FAULT"" and takes them back. He waits, I rudely start eating. After (too much) time the sliders come back with chedder. Chedder looks BARELY melted. Fries - COLD. He picks up the slider... soggy bottom bun, but scalding f'n hot! WTF is going on here?? Sends back again and reorders a cheeseburger instead.  Now, one would think the manager would come over, or the waitress would bring some hot fries out to snack on since a burger will take awhile... nope nothing.

The last thing somebody that has been ill for the last day and a half from eating at your restaurant wants to do is eat there ever again. Overall the place was dirty, service was mediocre, and the food was decent tasting but toxic. I hope that by me calling them and posting this that it will keep other people from feeling as ill from food poisoning as me and my Grandpa did. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

We ordered the 2 for 20 deal, which came with a lot of food, which was good for the price we paid. The problem is, the mac and cheese that my friend ordered had bacon in it (he can't eat bacon because of his religion). There was no information on the menu that said that the meal would come with bacon, they just put it on without asking. I found that to be pretty insensitive, the waitress should have asked first instead of making assumptions. When my friend explained that he couldn't eat bacon, the waitress told him to order something different on the menu. I kept asking why he couldn't just have the same mac and cheese, only without the bacon sprinkled on. She explained that she couldn't do that because ""it just came with bacon""... I literally don't think she comprehended a word I was saying. Anyways, my friend ended up ordering some food that he didn't even want.

We order the following:  * Chicken Won Ton Tacos (bland) * Beef Sliders (dry, looked like it was slapped together cause the cheese was not even melted all the way) * Fried Green Beans (madd salty! You could literally see the grains of excess salt on the plate!) *Cherry Limeade *Strawberry Limeade (I've had better) The food was horrible! Definitely not worth the price we paid.

When he finally got the check, these were his exact words, ""Here ya go"" and walked off. NO ""Thank You"" or ""How was everything?""  For the record we are very generous tippers.

Once to get our order, once to set our food down, and once to give us our check. That is it. It was about 9PM on a week night, so it was not very busy. He seemed to be in the back the whole time, and after talking with some acquaintances we saw leaving as we were coming in, they confirmed that they had experienced the same lack of service but with a different waiter.

Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,2.0,3/12/2011,"During my four years in college, Applebee's became a staple whenever my parents came to visit. So now, I cringe after hearing someone suggest going to Applebee's. However, we needed to grab a quick dinner in order to catch a movie at 8pm. We arrived at around 6:30pm, waited less than five minutes, and were seated at one of the high tables surrounding the bar area. After getting our menus, our waiter acknowledged us as he went to tend to a neighboring table.  Normally, I like their Grilled Shrimp 'N Spinach Salad (dressing on the side), but instead, I felt like mixing it up. After browsing the extensive menu (seriously took me at least five minutes to skim through it all), I decided to try the Grilled Dijon Chicken & Portobellos (without the cheese) off of their ""Under 550 Calories"" menu. Actually, they list the calorie content for all of their dishes! My parents ordered off of the ""2 for $20"" menu and got the Spinach & Artichoke dip with two orders of the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. My sister also ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp, but just by itself. About 10-15 minutes later, we finally received the Spinach & Artichoke dip appetizer. Granted, they were getting busy, but that's a long time to wait to get an appetizer! I know someone who used to work at Applebee's and she even admitted that most of the food is prepackaged and just heated up before being served. On top of that, the dip wasn't even hot! It was just mildly warm. Served with a small side of salsa, the chips were clearly greasy because you could see a shine on them. The dip it self was okay. I enjoyed the salsa more so just because the kick it had was more flavorful than the dip. Another 10-15 minutes later, our entrees arrived... Well, most of our entrees. My parents go their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp dishes and I got my Grilled Dijon Chicken & Portobellos. However, it was another solid 5 minutes before my sister got her Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. There's no good excuse for such a delay except for the fact that they forgot it or someone took it for another table. Finally, my sister got her dish (without mushrooms, as requested). My dish was surprisingly tasty! I expected it to be nothing special, but there's something about that white Dijon sauce that nicely flavored the chicken. The peppers and mushrooms were also nicely grilled. The ""assorted vegetables"" it came with turned out to just be one giant piece of steamed broccoli. Also, the herb potatoes just appeared to be unseasoned steamed potatoes -- I tried a bite and decided it wasn't worth eating. My parent's dishes looked pretty good, but obviously covered in grease because everything was so shiny! They were served piping hot and you could hear the sizzle on the cast iron serving dish! I didn't get to try any of the shrimp or potatoes, but I did try a bite of the chicken. It was a little dry and not very flavorful, but everyone pretty much finished off their plates, so it must have been pretty good, or at least decent. It was about 7:15 by the time we finished up and requested the check -- just in time to grab our things and head out to the movie theater. Oh Applebee's, you've become a staple in my life for quick, decent food. No matter how many iffy or average experiences I have, I always find myself coming back every now and then. One of the things I do like about this place is the fact that they have low calorie options for those who don't want to consume a day's worth of calories in one meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=100

This was my first choice for dinner on 12/30/10 as a last night staying at the Hyatt Place for my birthday getaway. We had a 20 minute wait, to begin with, and I don't mind that at all. I've waited an hour and a half at Outback Steakhouse plenty of times before. When we finally got sat, no one greeted us for like 13 minutes, and when our server Shasta finally arrived, she took the drink orders, and she looked absolutely lost, and then told me how cute my phone case was. I was still pretty patient at this time, even though I've seen her walk past our table within that 13 minute radius without any kind of acknowledgement.  I am not known to flag people down, because as a server, I know how that feels. But 13 minutes?!  We ordered a diet Coke, and water, and was still deciding on the menu. Shasta did not come back with our drinks even after 7 minutes have gone by, and then when she finally had the chance to stop for a second, she said she was coming back to take our order. I was starving and I told her that we weren't going to stay, because I didn't know when she was actuallyr eally coming back. We got up to leave, and I am just too drained to talk to a useless manager at an Applebee's, so I told the hostess that we were leaving due to poor, slow service. I work at an even busier place with even more demanding people than this, and not once do I not at least initially greet them. I  am done, Applebee's of NorCal.

Jojo C.,"San Francisco, CA",106,160,1355,4.0,1/7/2013,"First off let me start this review by saying these guys or (just our server) did a great job on our 1st experience to the Dublin Applebees. I may not be able to relate to the other poor reviews but maybe it was just our lucky day there :) We 1st enter and get seated asap. We do the happy hour special after 9, plenty of booth seating, nice family atmosphere, clean and looks good. We then see a bartender who took care of us immediately ask us for any drinks to start of with, we order to mango margs that our server ""he"" made came out delicious and I'm a bartender that makes these drinks all day long. We get the sliders and mozzarella sticks which came out nice with great presenation. Burgers cooked perfectly then again they make em at all applebees good, my fav. We then ask for another round of mango margs, we get it back, no salt, no lime, and ...no alchohal! Big no for me. I had to take off a star for that. The server quickly recovered and he made it right. The 2nd round was from a lady at the bar talking a customers ear off, not really attending the others, she may have known the guy or something.  Anyways our server, I forgot his name, but stocky guy, has a stiff dry face, could crack a smile sometime, but he did a great job, attending us every 5 min, great timing, everything was right thanks to him. I wish i knew his name but excellent job my friend. And this is coming from a guy at the Country Club on the top of the hill.

Maureen P.,"Oakland, CA",228,106,573,2.0,11/4/2012,"Yes, what the other reviews say is true.. Service do kinda suck here. We had a party of ten on a sunday night, but luckily was seated right away because the place was pretty much dead. We ordered our food almost right away since we already knew what we wanted. It took them over 35 minutes to bring out our appetizers. They actually forgot our buffalo wings, so after bringing it to their attention, they brought it out after they brought out our entrees. I ordered the 9oz sirloin with loaded mash and fries. The portions were very generous compared to the other applebees I've been to. My steak was a bit on the salty side so I needed extra sauce with my meat. A couple of my friends did some substitutions for their side but didn't receive what they ordered, which I find weird. Didn't you write everything down? During our whole meal, no one stopped by to check if we needed anything or if everything was ok. We would have to flag them down while they rushed by to even get a refill. Overall, stars for my own food, mostly because of the portions. Negatives: service..

Truthful Shopper A.,"Modesto, CA",6,25,,1.0,8/28/2015,"Read the reviews after my lunch experience here at this Dublin location. Should have talked to the manager but didn't want to waste my breathe. Not sure if the management is aware of all these bad reviews on this location nonetheless if corporate is aware but my 1 star proves all these other bad reviews true. Arrived at about 3pm, 8/27/2015, and was empty. Well 1-2 people at the actual bar and 1 couple in the actual dinning room floor. Arrived my buddy and I for a quick lunch without thinking twice to spend more near the movie theatre area to try something new. Well, just say Applebee's is pretty much reached the bottom of the Fast food chain behind McDonald's. We sat in the bar section at the big round bar tables. Our experience was Slow paced service, food took unusually long for not being busy at all, and of course 3 girls standing in front of a computer near the bartender, all while the actual bartender serving us and the 2 people at the bar. Bartender who served us did an okay job. Not the best, but she managed to help a few people and maybe she could have asked the other girls for help. Waiting for our food, we knew it was ready after 20 mins upon receiving our wings, and the bartender was too busy to go back and check if our food was ready. Sure enough when we saw her go in the back to ""check,"" she brought our food. 1 min before we were about to get up, pay our $5 wings tab and leave. In the end, the young lady who waited tables to the right of the door did an excellent job, and  as we walked out, we told the lady who sat us down that we should have sat there and skipped the ""quick bar area."" Applebee's has  lost our usual $3-400 tab at the bar when it's guys night and don't think I'll eat at another Applebee's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=140

Jaime S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/9/2014,"Applebee's as a chain is alright... There's something for everyone, the Happy Hour is awesome, it's cheap, and they do have a few dishes I often find myself craving.  This particular Applebee's however, needs a lot of work. The service is SLOW.  I've been in there a few times over the last year and almost ever time I have been appalled by how painfully slow the service is.  (And I was a server for over 6 years so I am usually one to make excuses for slow service, knowing all the variables that can be the cause. ).  One time when I was in there we ordered. 2-for-20.  The way this works is that two people order one appetizer to share, and each order one entree, and share the $20 check.  (Amazing deal by the way!) usually the appetizer is quick and comes out within ten minutes and the entrees follow about 10-15 minutes after that.  On this particular night my boyfriend and I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip for the app, he ordered a pasta dish with chicken, and I order the napa chicken dish (yum!).  Now, I know for a fact that the spinach and artichoke dip takes about 5 to 8 minutes to prepare (it's pre-portioned and microwaved/broiled once ordered.) When our dip didn't come after 15 minutes I figured ""ok maybe they had to defrost some frozen dip and fry some new tortilla chips."" (This at most would have taken 20 minutes.). We sat patiently and didn't even whine.  It was about 25 minutes before I finally had to call over our server and ask what the holdup was.  He said he wasn't sure and would check on it. (No apology.) A few minutes later he said ""the kitchen is working in it"" and walked away again. (Still no apology!) Ten more minutes pass (at this point it has been over 45 minutes since we ordered and not even our 5-minute app has arrived.) The server was about to take his 5th trip passed us without saying anything when I finally stopped him as said ""listen, even if our dip is still not ready, can you bring out entrees as soon as they are ready? We are pretty hungry.""  Sure enough he comes right out with our entrees! They were scorching hot and the sauce on my BF's pasta had started to harden.  The plates had clearly been sitting in the hot window for at least 15 minutes.  Finally I asked to talk with a manager.  The only excuse they had for the slow service was that ""all the cooks were on break.""  Sorry... But I've never heard of a restaurant that allows all of their line cooks to take their breaks at the same time in the middle of a dinner shift!  I didn't even put up a fight I was so over it.  Our dip came out eventually but there was literally no explanation for the wait other than the lack of cooks in the kitchen.  The manager didn't even offer to comp our app... Just offered a ""free"" desert Shooter (which only cost $3) Bad form Applebee's.   Anyway, the moral of the story is avoid this location if you can, and if you can't...

Zack B.,"San Ramon, CA",38,16,,1.0,5/12/2015,"My family and I wondered why the wait next door at Black Angus was over an hour and you could get right in at Applebee's with no wait.... its partially because the food is way worse but mostly because the service was awful. It always took so long to get the attention of the waitress who seemed irritated to even be there. I dont remember her name but she was in her 30s maybe early 40's, black hair pulled back in a ponytail. I cant speak for every server there but she needs to find a new gig. We got our food (ribs) and got the honey bbq ones. They were surprisingly spicy despite sounding like they would be sweet. After returning them for another item were explained that the rub used on all the ribs ""has some kick to it"". If this was the case it should be mentioned in the menu clearly. For arguments sake maybe we are just spicy food wimps and couldn't handle it. We certainly felt that way and felt even worse asking for another order but we simply couldn't eat it (we never like to be ""that guy""). The manager came out (a blonde girl) and she was nice. They almost got a save for this move despite the long wait for our food and lack of attention the whole time....Then I waited 30 mins between finishing my food and getting my check.... My dimwitted waitress up and disappeared and my 2 year old went berserk for 20 minutes. I'm surprised nobody helped us if for no other reason to get our screaming child out of the restaurant.

Deb D.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,11,,1.0,11/7/2010,"Went for dinner on a Sunday night (11/07/2010). The hostess was terrible and clueless about good customer service: didn't greet, walked away without speaking when we asked for a booth, returned with a towel and asked us to follow her. We sat down after she did a once over to the table with the towel. She gave us menus and walked away without speaking (no enjoy your meal, nothing). The food tasted like frozen food microwaved (shoulda gone to Safeway for a frozen meal and saved $40). The waiter Chris was just okay, though he could learn how to say, ""You're welcome"" instead of ""Yip"" I left him a small tip only because he did say, ""Enjoy your meal.""

David A.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2014,"If I could, I would put zero stars. I did not think service could get any worse than the Livermore location. Party of six, real easy order. Four salads, a burger and a kids burger. Simple enough? Food comes out one salad short. The waiter and host do not even pay attention that one salad is missing. A couple minutes go by before our waitress comes by to check and make sure we are okay. I tell her my salad is missing and she proceeds to tell me I'll fix it. After a half hour of waiting for my salad ( I saw personally three salads that I ordered go passed to other tables) and everyone else finishing their meals I still did not have mine. Me and my wife ordered waters to go with our drinks, took three times of asking to finally get one. We ordered a mango lemonade for my daughter (age six, this comes into play in a minute) and my wife. The waitress brought out mango iced tea to both my wife and daughter. More went wrong but I think this gives you an idea. Probably not typical but was just ridiculous. After hearing ""we just had a cook walk out"" and ""yes it should of been put to the front of the line but it didn't"" I got frustrated. All I asked for politely was to cancel my salad and give me the check. I did not need to hear any sob stories or what can we do to make this up?

Tetsu N.,"Dublin, CA",452,391,25,3.0,7/10/2008,"I'd give Applebee's more stars, but they do some funky stuff with food that I often think has too much taste contrast. Their steaks are all right.  They use the Viking series of Grills, but with a customized size and no closing top, I think.  Can't remember, but I also think they added the infrared heaters for searing.  But I think the searing grill doesn't exceed 1200 degrees because I don't see the hard sear on any of the steaks, which sort of bums me out.  But they're not bad. I do like their steak and shrimp with cheese sauce combo.  I could never get that sauce right, so it's a real treat to be able to eat that dish. Where I have trouble is the salads.  The salads have just way too much taste contrast, and while that can work really well, it's a gamble.  When I read the ingredients on the menu, I think, huh, that's creative and sounds like it could be really good.  But then, when the food comes, it's just too strong a series of tastes and they don't go well together for my taste.  Some folks may like it. The desserts are my other problem.  They taste okay, though way too sweet most of the time.  But you can easily soften the taste with some tea or coffee.  The bigger problem for me is the sheer volume.  C'mooooon.  After a soup or salad, a steak with way too much fries or mashed potatoes, having a dessert like the ones they serve is clearly too much.   They have health foods, and carb light foods, but those don't sound too attractive when you're at a steak house, and it still doesn't resolve the dessert issue. What I'd really like to see are simple salads with just a touch of creativity but not overbearing, a good steak and some simple and low volume side dishes, and desserts that are reasonably sized. Yes yes, I can always leave the food.  But where i come from, you eat what you're served, and that habit is hard to break.  Besides, if you pay for it, you don't want it to go to waste.   Oh well, guess you can't have everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=220

Kelly W.,"Dublin, CA",125,8,,1.0,5/21/2011,"One of the worst dining experiences we have had. We walked in just expecting to order appetizers. We were told that to get the happy hour prices, you can only sit in the bar and that the bar is full. We could either wait, or sit in the restaurant but would not be able to get the happy hour prices.  We said that since the bar is full, we should be allowed to sit outside the bar but still get the prices. They said they couldn't do that. I work in the service industry, and if people are willing to spend money at your establishment, you should be treating them as if they are appreciated. And not just cause the economy sucks. So after about ten minutes of waiting, another waiter asks if we have been helped. We told him why we were waiting, he said he would go talk to a manager. He returned a few minutes later and said we could sit in the restaurant. He took our drink order (without writing it down) and literally 10 seconds later, repeated it back wrong. I corrected him. He brought out my partners drink and finally mine a few minutes later. Took our dinner order (again, without writing anything down), and then repeated it back wrong. We corrected him again by repeating the entire order back to him correctly. When our order arrived, we saw that instead of the boneless wings with southern BBQ, we got boneless wings with buffalo sauce. We brought this to his attention and with an exasperated voice he said ""sorry, that'll be another five minutes."" He brings out the new boneless wings about 5 minutes later. As we were eating them, we noticed that they were wrong again. We had received the regular BBQ instead of southern BBQ. Rather than complain again and have to wait even longer, we just ate them. If you cannot remember a fairly simple order, you should be writing it down. And to bring out the wrong order and give an unconvincing apology doesn't fly. Our last time at this applebees was just ok, so needless to say, we won't be coming back to this one.

He told us that we were in a ""casual dining experience"" and they could serve the meal in whatever courses they choose.  That there was no set order to how the courses should come out.   I could not even believe what I was hearing and I informed him that ""clearly, we are at the wrong restaurant"" and we left.  I thought about this for several days and told countless people of it.  We even left there and went to a different restaurant and ask the waitress there if she had ever heard of any such procedure.  No one has been able to believe that was our experience.  We enjoyed Applebee's in the past but we would not return there after this experience.  Overall, it is a problem when a restaurant rushes the courses which seems to be a common problem but to defend it in such a manner was unreal.   I have learned to order my meal in single courses as they don't seem to get it.  No one goes to a restaurant to be rushed and have cold food because there is no timing on the part of the cook.  Once the order goes in you better get to chomping because the food is going to be cold by the time you let it sit there on the table because you haven't even finished the salad yet.  I would never order appetizer in conjunction with a salad and entree again.  We are seasoned in restaurant experiences and this was the most unreal we have had in many years.  Would not go there again, ever!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=240

We got to the parking lot and were greatly disappointed but decided to go anyways. The service was okay but the food sucked and it was realllly slow to come out. I guess I should have checked the Yelp first!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Delna R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/26/2011,"I do believe I just found the remnants of a cockroach in yesterday's leftovers from Applebee's (Dublin). I'm mortified!  Sick, sick, sick!!   I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and the manager was less than sympathetic.  She said she would have the General Manager call me when he is available IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. Wow.   I also remembered that last night there was a couple sitting in the booth behind my husband and I.  I overheard the woman explaining to their waitress that her companion was still in the bathroom vomiting.  The waitress said she would take his meal off the tab.  Ya think???!   I usually don't post negative reviews, but I'm disgusted and I hope this review will prevent others from having the same experience.  This is unacceptable.  I shudder to think what else might be found in that kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Linda D.,"San Jose, CA",1211,448,1494,4.0,11/3/2011,Every applebees is the same to me! My friends and I just came here after going to the pirates of Emerson haunted houses. I forgot our waitress' name but she was really nice and she split the bill in different parties beforehand without us even saying which was very convenient.  Only downside the blue moon comes in a bottle! I don't know why it didn't come in a tall glass but whateverrrr,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Nora S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,95,,3.0,1/9/2016,"Ordered the ribs with salad and fries.  Ribs, salad and fries.  None of it was very good.  My friend was not too happy with her meal either and thought her vegetables were very soft.  The service was good and the portions were plentiful.  I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Kim H.,"Dublin, CA",59,12,,5.0,1/25/2015,Great experience! Tried black angus first and they turned us away because we were a party of 11.

Stormtrooper N.,"Daly City, CA",0,89,23,1.0,6/22/2014,"I had the worst experience here. It started when I walked in and the host told us it would be a 25 min wait. But then a lady came and said the host was ""smoking something"" and it should only be a few minutes. I later found out that she was the manager.  Then it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order but we ordered as well just in case he didn't come back for another 15 minutes.  After we ordered it took over 40-45 minutes for our food to come. We asked him to check a while before but it still took a while. I told out server to at least bring out some free appetizers or something since it was taking so long. He never brought anything out.  After being served it took another 30 minutes for him to even check in on us. So I just asked for the check because I wanted to get the hell outta there. While we were waiting for our check, the lady manager was walking around chatting with the customers. She was talking loudly about what she posts on her Facebook page. Oh my.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Charles D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,132,8,1.0,9/2/2012,Took forever and service was ridiculous.    I came in when it was relatively slow and it took a good 35 min to get a to go order together.   They gave me the food with no plastic ware or napkins  I'll go somewhere else,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
June B.,"Castro Valley, CA",66,18,,1.0,1/28/2015,"Service was very slow despite only a dozen or so patrons in the restaurant at 12:30 pm. Our waiter was personable but slow. However, my food was less than satisfactory. I ordered the lunch combo of Thai shrimp salad and chicken tortilla soup. The shrimp appeared to be undercooked and the salad dressing had a metallic taste. The tortilla soup was bland. The manager deducted $6 from our bill when I mentioned the shrimp was undercooked. Nevertheless, I won't be returning to any Applebees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120

Ann W.,"San Ramon, CA",1,9,,1.0,1/15/2016,"Rudest hostess ever. Asked to speak to manager after we were seated to inform her, and she didn't really seem to care or apologize. Staff seemed slow and lazy. NO customer service. Isn't this the time for many places to focus on service ?  My chicken salad was still good and that is the only reason to come here.

Katie R.,"San Ramon, CA",2,5,,1.0,9/2/2014,"All you can eat ribs..... What a joke! 5 small ribs to kick off (apparently 1lb of ribs - get the weighing scales tested), followed by a 15 minute wait before 4 more, equally small ribs, were brought out. If you advertise as all-you-can eat,  the portion should be more than just an appetiser.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Daryl K.,"Benicia, CA",119,85,22,1.0,3/29/2014,This place is so slow it's ridiculous. On top of that they didn't get my order right! There was no utensils at all and the other waitresses just sat around and talked. The food quality was sub par I will not be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Ann V.,"Lathrop, CA",50,47,4,1.0,5/16/2012,I have never had worse service then the service i had here! I've been here twice and both times the server was extremely rude and orders incorrect. I went here recently on mothers day my order was wrong and the servers response was that there was nothing she could do because they were busy due to mothers day!  I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was very nice and very apologetic for how his employee acted. I hope the manager gets a hold on his employees so he doesn't lose anymore business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Rae C.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,1,1.0,1/11/2015,"Sucks! Do not waste your money. The baby back ribs were like rubber, the steak was dry, the hamburger and bacon was over cooked, and the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for (silverware, straw, beverage....). To top the night off,  we were told that the manager was on the telephone and could not come and talk  to us. Wow! Such crap customer service. Try one of the other resturant in the area....this one is terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dublin-6?start=120
Ashley N.,"Dublin, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2015,"I just had quick and great service. Teresa was my server and Brianna was my hostess. Both of them were wonderful.
