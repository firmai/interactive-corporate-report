Laurie K.,"Chandler, AZ",60,115,15,4.0,11/25/2017,I haven't been to a Fridays in years! Food was amazing! View was amazing! Emily took really good care of us considering she was really patient on the amount of refills she had to get our table. Would definitely want to go back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Timothy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",26,59,,1.0,4/10/2017,"If you find yourself at this place..two things have happened...one...you have given up looking for a good place to eat...and two..you have chosen to not care how you spend you money. This place would be the place you break up with people..it's just horrible. I ordered boneless wings..which took way too long and arrived cold. A sloppy sauce was added to remind me that I had ordered flavored bread. SRLSY, if this place was not at the ballpark it would have long been closed down.  I would like to add that a table next to me also complained of the food being cold.  There is no reason to go here on a non-baseball game day...unless you need to tell that special someone you want them out of your life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",309,543,1177,3.0,8/14/2016,Def a fun place to eat overlooking chase field.  Had the all you can eat appies for $10 and came out way too full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Earl L.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,2,,1.0,5/30/2017,Hostess looks like she did not want to be there bartender didn't know the menu the server looked angry upset at the world and was scooping ice with the glass I saw three managers and nobody walking the tables I passed two managers and nobody said have a nice day or ask me how things were nine tenths of an experience is the service I wish I would have read the reviews before I went   nice view  to expensive for poor service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Jose A.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,1,,2.0,7/17/2017,We decided to visit this place yesterday as a family get together..  food was alright I got the turkey burger it's was pretty good love there sweet potatoes fry my wife had jack Daniels chicken she didn't not like the chicken it had a rubbery texture.. really nice place to dine..  the reason I gave it 2 starts was because our server had a little attitude going on..  didn't appreciate that.. overall ok..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4

Raquel R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",733,153,640,3.0,11/21/2016,I came here to have a drink and watch the kids playing in the stadium. The views are really cool and it was my first time at TGIF in quite some time. I had the cotton candy/ pink punk martini and it was really good... Sweet.. but good. Service was also enjoyable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Jacy S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,3,1.0,3/20/2016,Unfortunately our server   Victoria  just dropped a bad score of heroin  so she was angry and drained  the food might of been good but it was served cold  The apps came she rolled her eyes when asked for plates joke on us she never brought them  Three servers and four table plus us where set at tables  so of course her work load was overwhelming  which caused  her service  to be more then under whelming,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
Serena G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",64,6,2,3.0,5/19/2016,Great place to watch the game last min.  Service is slow and food in always cold.  But watching the game is great,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-phoenix-4
