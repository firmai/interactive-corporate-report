Cassandra S.,"Cocoa, FL",7,5,,4.0,12/12/2012,I like it but don't get the French Onion Soup. It's terrible! Beside that staff is nice enough with the Avg TGIF atmosphere. I do suggest trying the Fried Green Bean Fries... Yummy to say the least! Also the Jack Daniels Burger seems to be popular.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island?start=20
Joseph D.,"Naperville, IL",27,17,,4.0,7/18/2010,"Stopped by here with my girls on way to airport to pickup my wife.  While we were short on time, the waitress got both our table order and to-go order out to us in the nick of time.  Very tasty potato skins, and alot of them (6), decent ribs, and two good skewers of KeyLime Shrimp.  Very comfortable to dine outdoors, and worked out great being just five minutes from Orlando airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island?start=20
Frank J.,"Beaumont, TX",0,7,,5.0,3/20/2013,Great place. Bar is totally awesome! Super drink and appetizer deals. Bing on Thursdays. Internet is insanely fast.  Just wish they were open later than 11:00 PM. Bartender was super hot too!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island?start=20
Adriana G.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,2,2,5.0,8/8/2015,We had wonderful service and our food was delicious. Our server Michael was very sweet and kept making sure we were happy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Bat W.,"Merritt Island, FL",1,26,2,1.0,2/6/2016,1 hour waiting for 4 appetizers. A couple came cold. A couple came out even later. Then we puked. Yeah...food poisoning. Might be considering this place for science fair next year. Not to eat at...to experiment on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Jim Y.,"Cocoa, FL",7,28,,2.0,6/11/2015,"We went this past weekend for the first time in quite some time.  It will be our last.  The food was just ""ok"".  We ordered potato skins for an appetizer and what we received was again, just ""ok"" - we've made better ourselves at home.  The entrees were warm but not hot, except for the fries which were done perfectly - hot & crispy.  Almost as if they forgot to cook them & our entrees had to wait while the fries cooked.  The worst part was the service.  We sat in the bar area and we were the only ones there for the majority of our visit, yet he disappeared for several long stretches.  Never asked my wife if she wanted a refill of her drink.  It took us flagging him down to refill her soda and my beer.  I don't know about the rest of the franchise but this one is a major disappointment to us, one time too many. Edit: wrote to the company via their website.  Never got a response. Edit: finally heard from them after sending another complaint.  Explained to her what happened - she apologized, then offered us gift coupons.   I declined.  She was VERY surprised.  I guess most people who say they'll never go back go anyway.  We're done with them permanently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Sheri B.,"Merritt Island, FL",0,10,,1.0,2/29/2016,"Visited this restaurant several years ago. Waited, waited and waited at the server booth but saw no one. Waitress who was on her way out, saw us and continued walking out. Restaurant was pretty much much empty. We even eyeballed the bar tender who shrugged and went back to cleaning glasses. After 5 minutes of standing there, we left angrily and have never been back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Erol G.,"Lemoore, CA",83,8,,5.0,8/8/2015,"Good service, with a great menu after a beach trip.  The building is great, I love the environment and how close it is to the mall. All the shopping around is great, love this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Barb R.,"Merritt Island, FL",25,11,,1.0,3/3/2015,"Went for the appetizer special tonight food was cold food when it came to the table . This was our 4th time in the past year. I see why the parking lot is empty most of the time . Tried to let them resurrect their past with us they did not meet the challenge .The grease taste ,the wait staff not very attentive. Sorry Fridays not a 5 th try here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Chriscoral A.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",40,184,126,3.0,6/10/2015,Great location if you are doing some shopping at the mall. Usual thcotchke chain restaurant.  Burgers are pretty good. Stay away from the steaks and seafood.  Nice bar in this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Michael M.,"Melbourne, FL",2,13,21,1.0,12/27/2015,"Tried to eat here during the holidays.  The parking lot was only about a quarter full, so we thought shouldn't be too busy. We found out why.  We meet a family member who had already arrived and had been seated for about 10 minutes.  When we walked in there was no hostess to be seen.  As a matter of fact, I did not see one the entire time.  We meet our party and waited, after 15 mins of no one showing up to even take a drink order, we left.  We will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Judge D.,"Titusville, FL",0,25,4,1.0,1/31/2016,We decided to go out for a Sunday dinner and decided on Fridays due to the empty parking lot and soon found out why. My wife and I went to this Fridays 1/31/16 at 4:00pm there was about 10 people in the restaurant and we were first seated in an area that was not being serviced by a server so we were re-seated. Miranda was our waitress and she was very un attentive for a restaurant with no one in it.We ordered dinner and it was brought out the portions are not worth the price at all. Once we got our check it was calculated wrong and we had to get it corrected then Miranda disappeared I waited 10 mins until she reappeared remember there is no one in the restaurant. Do not go to this Fridays how is it even still open,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Crystal P.,"Cocoa, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2015,Absolutely horrible Hostess and service plus all of our food was cold by the time it got to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
La La F.,"Cape Canaveral, FL",69,65,214,1.0,2/14/2015,"Skimpi plates & terrible service. The bartender with the tattoos was good, but I've had a bad experience here otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Luke J.,"Holly Springs, NC",1,24,8,1.0,4/20/2015,If I could give this place negative stars it would get it. Food was subpar even for a TGI Friday's. Our food was left to sit in the window while they recorded some burned chicken. Seems like Friday is going way down hill. I will not be returning to Fridays again too many choices here with better food in Merritt Island area. This used to be a great go to chain not sure what happened to it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Ken H.,"Orlando, FL",248,83,76,1.0,1/16/2013,"I don't take the Yelp star rating system lightly but this place is a complete service disaster and deserves 1 star.  My most recent visit was a second chance I was offering after the abysmal time we had a month or so ago.  I am not a complainer usually but felt compelled to take their survey and was contacted by the location manager who was very gracious and apologetic so we decided to give them another chance.  No changes have been made since our last visit. I can understand a place like TGI Friday's trying to be casual but there is a fine line between casual and downright unprofessional, and they have definitely crossed that line.  The last two times we've dined there, we have been one of only five or so tables and the staff is so chatty and at times vulgar, it is completely distracting.  Unfortunately, we were seated at this table right next to the computer where they print bills, etc. and none of the staff hold back when talking to one another.  One young female server dropped the F-bomb in conversation with another server.  I curse a lot myself but I was disgusted by the lack of professionalism by everyone there.   The food is not impressive in the least.  The new pretzel sticks have no pretzel taste at all and are more like breadsticks and the beer cheese they use is runny.  My steak was covered in butter and very rare in the middle so they had to re-heat it.  They must have problems in the kitchen because I'm always asked to cut into my steak when they bring it out, which is completely tacky.  The rice has a nice texture and would be tasty but it had a strange fishy taste to it.  There was an issue with our bill and we pointed it out so our server Chris, who was very nice and polite about it, and brought it to the manager who made some changes but they were still not correct.  We tried explaining this to the manager who proceeded to angrily crumple up the receipt and take it from our table declaring that he'd fix it again. I actually got so disgusted that I walked out and left my wife to deal with him. One of the other reasons we came back here again is because we got a gift card and I've told my family that next time, they can keep them for themselves because I will not come back to this disaster of a restaurant even if they paid me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Rebecca L.,"Tampa, FL",0,14,,2.0,5/18/2015,"Ok so our experience there was quite nice.  Our waitress was fantastic, our food tasted good, the entire hostess team was incredibly friendly (5 stars)!  The only down side to the visit was that of four plates, they brought none of the entrees out at the same time and each with a good five minutes in between.  Not the end of the world, we moved on. Here's the problem.  A few hours later two of our group got violently sick.  We traced our steps and our best guess was perhaps something to do with the grease for the fries.  We didn't want to blame anyone (because who knows where it truly came from), but just in case we thought we'd call and just tell them what happened and perhaps they could double check their grease.  Again we had NO intention of blaming anyone, it could have very well been a stomach bug.  We called, the man who answered the phone just said ""uh ok"".   We thought nothing of it and moved on. Here's the reason for the rating.  A few minutes later, I guess that same man caller I.d.'d our number and called us back just to argue that it could not have possibly been food poisoning because ""that takes 24 hours and you can't get sick from rancid grease.""  My reaction... Why call and argue when we weren't trying to prove anything?  We just wanted to offer our story if in any way it could affect other people.  We never wanted to accuse anyone.  And we completely understand that they would not want to admit or apologize for anything due to liability.  My frustration is the poor decision quality of this individual to call and argue.  I am more inclined to poorly review and never visit this establishment based on that second call, than the fact that there is a small chance the sickness came from that restaurant.  I would have just appreciated ""I'm so sorry to hear you are feeling unwell.  We will double check everything.  Thank you."" Again, the majority of the staff was friendly.  We enjoyed the meal, the food tasted good.  A few hours later two were sick (but who knows what caused it).  I would just avoid Mr. Argumentative.  Let's hope he's not the manager or was coached by a manager to make that second call.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Jim D.,"Merritt Island, FL",0,18,3,1.0,1/25/2014,"My wife and I didn't have any kids for this Saturday afternoon and decided to head to Friday's because we have seen the commercials on television advertising their 500 calorie dishes. That sounded good to us and we went. We got there about 2:30 in the afternoon and I said there doesn't seem to be very many cars in the parking lot. We went in and was greeted and sat down at our table. The waitress came over to us in a timely fashion and asked if we would like something to drink. I said a long island iced tea and my wife said a margarita on the rocks and no salt. She never has salt with her margarita because she monitors her salt intake. The waitress asked for both of our ID's, no mind you, I understand that they are following the law, but I am in my 50's and my wife is in her 40's. I felt that the fact she asked us that was strange, but I went along with it. So after she was satisfied that we were of drinking age she left. At that point we started looking at the menu. I commented that there seems to be a rather large array or menu choices but we never found the 500 calorie menu. With all the clutter on the menu, I decided to just get what sounded good at the time. After about 10 minutes the waitress came back and asked if we would like to order and that our drinks will be out shortly. I ordered the steak with sweet potato fries and broccoli. My wife ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. We both ordered side salads. After about 5 minutes, the ""manager"" came over with our salads and asked if we needed anything more, then she noticed the lack of any cups on the table and said, other than your drinks. And she left to get them. The waitress came back with our drinks and of course, my wife's margarita had a rim of salt on it. She gave it to the waitress and said she asked for no salt. The waitress questioned it but left with it fast to not cause a scene. We got our food and then my wife got her new drink. We both took a sip of our drinks and noticed the lack of alcohol in them. We spent, 6.78 cents and 7.49 cents for virgin drinks!!! Not to mention, there were only 10 customers in the entire establishment and it took them over 20 minutes to get them to our booth. Back to the food. My steak was made to order, the broccoli was boiled in water and put on the plate. And the sweet potato fries were doused in the same seasonings they put on regular fries! For me that was completely unacceptable. You sprinkle them with salt and then give the customer the choice of cinnamon and sugar or whatever else hey want on them. I ate 2 and left the rest. The broccoli was nasty but did good for my diet. On my wifes side, she liked her dish, the chicken was not spicy but the shrimp was. The sauce on the noodles was not spicy either which surprised me because it was supposed to be a spicy dish.  The bottom line, we will never go back to this place again, we will make sure our visiting friends from up north will not visit this place either. Total disappointment, we should have just went to Applebee's because their 550 calorie dishes are very easy to pick out and their drinks have alcohol in them!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island
Lisa M.,"Rockledge, FL",0,1,,5.0,6/26/2015,"I ate there yesterday with my husband and daughter. I can not begin to describe how great my experience was. Starting with my server, she was more than helpful and filled us in on all there current deals, she was able to answer any and all questions we had. My daughter being a toddler started to act up, our server joanna, was more then accommodating to have her food come out first. My husband ordered the BFM Margarita, and the bartender on staff made it perfect.   On top of all that the food was cooked perfect. As we are eating the male manger came over and asked how are  meals were and if we needed anything else. As I was about to say a refill of my diet coke, there was my server behind him with a glass of diet coke. Alot of changes has been made under the new management and love every change made. I will be telling everyone I know of the changes made. Couldn't be happier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-merritt-island

Crystal Y.,"Cocoa, FL",0,2,,1.0,4/25/2015,"Bad bad bad service went there last night which was a Saturday it was no business at all, only people in there was the people who worked there n they messed up my whole order, i ask for my steak to be well it was raw, then I wanted the mac n cheese on the menu and they gave me some bs looked like box mac n cheese what I could of made at home, not Tgif man cheese with the bread crumbs. It was just horrible and the sad part it was no body in there to be rushing.. but I guess it was my fault going there when it's nobody there on a Saturday night.. should known something was wrong..
