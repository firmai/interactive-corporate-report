13,Don F.,"O'Fallon, IL",161,334,85.0,5.0,2012-01-15,"So there is a little snow on the ground tonight.  I got back from the airport and was hungry at 9pm.  I had to pass 6 restaurants that were closed despite having published hours they are open.   I really do not like Applebee's, but faced with they or consuming human flesh to maintain my girlish figure.   I wanted a scotch and soda since I got on the plane.  Southwest was out of Scotch on that flight.  Arrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Get to Applebee's and the waitress doesn't know what brands the bar stocks.  Kinda bothers me, but she finds out, acknowledges that they don't have a lot of scotch drinkers, and returns with my favorite.  Very nice recovery!  +1 The waitress was really good.  Recommended chicken wonton tacos.  They were new and really good.   I had a side salad that could have been an entree, and it came with enough dressing.   Finally, Kelly helped customize a bruschetta burger with quesadilla cheese. It sounds off, but it Really hit the spot.   Below are the places on the list for closing early.  I will consider Applebee's before patronizing them again.  A few were independently owned restaurants.  You would think in this economy they would want the business.

12,Janice B.,"Belleville, IL",0,9,,4.0,2012-04-26,"I have been to this Applebee's several times. It seems more friendly and better than most Applebee's. It really doesn't feel like a chain restaurant.  I've never been disappointed here by bad food, wrong order, or poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
15,Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66.0,3.0,2012-08-17,this is about the only applebee's that i don't have problems.  the staff is friendly. the food is usually pretty good. my nephew and the waiter today had a long convo about what teachers my nephew has this year.  the pomegranate tea was very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
16,Ariana F.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,24,11.0,1.0,2012-12-13,"I know not to expect much from an Applebee's, but I really don't know what goes on in that kitchen of theirs. Unfortunately I have eaten here twice in the last few months and both times have not been able to eats food due to saltiness. Now I am not talking a little over seasoned, I'm talking salty!  It is rare for me to ever send food back, but this was just I edible. Not only did I have this problem twice, but the others in my party suffered from tough, poorly cooked steaks and undercooked baked potatoes.  Your best bet here would be chicken strips. You can't mess those up, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
17,Amanda G.,"Belleville, IL",37,161,,3.0,2014-05-03,"Swansea Applebee's was a common place for us since it's so close to our home, but for the last 3-4 years, it's been so hit-or-miss that we haven't visited in some time. Their steaks are always so tenderized they're almost mealy. It's one thing to have a juicy, tender steak. It's another to have one that has a texture of polenta inside. The service has been very good to great nearly every time, but be careful. There are two servers in the place that are completely apathetic. Both are females but since they have never told me their names, I can't tell you exactly who to avoid. Casual interaction as my waitress is fine, but to be so casual as to come off as though you couldn't care less that I was sitting in your section? Yeah, think not. I also hate how they serve broccoli. I complained once and was told it's a franchise standard. Yes, because serving me cut up broccoli and not half a stalk is way harder and much more expensive. I'm not a rabbit. I shouldn't be served a damn stalk on a plate. I love the lower cal and Weight Watchers menu items, but I hate how the menu constantly changes but always seems to be the same regarding tastes and flavors? Is that just me?? The bet time for Applebee's, in my opinion, is when they teamed up with Tyler Florence. Since that ended, it's been sub-par a lot. Not terrible but definitely just normal chain food. Problem is: a lot of the chains are upping the ante. Step up, Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
7,Tara V.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,1,,1.0,2014-08-07,Went there for dinner Tuesday I'm pretty sure our food was rancid we told the manager just smiled like it was no big deal offered us something else I really couldn't believe it why would I want anything else if the meat was rotten!!!!! Not to mention you really never know who is waiting on you because like 8 different people wait on you The place has really gone down hill it's a shame,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
10,Amber K.,"Alexandria, VA",118,382,42.0,1.0,2014-08-31,"Yuck. I've never been a fan of Applebee's, but kudos to their branding because my daughters love when we pass by. To humor them, I decided to try them after some time. It took forever to get our drinks. We ordered and the waitress was nice even ringing it up as a special to save some money. Then we sat there and sat there. We were seated by the door and the manager saw us, but no one noticed we hadn't got our salad. I was looking for our waitress to have her bring something out for my kids. When I saw her she asked how our salads were and I said we never got them. Mind you she only had mine and one kids food. She asked if I wanted my salad to go, but I said no. Eventually she brought our salads and the other half of the food came. My shrimp was burned and the fries were flavorless. My little one didn't care for her pizza and the other didn't like her Mac n. Cheese. My drink was empty, but never got a refill. The waitress blamed the salad on another server stealing them but she was not attentive, especially since I never got a refill. Poor service and bad food to boot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
14,Lelani G.,"Belleville, IL",0,45,11.0,3.0,2015-05-28,hit or miss. they are typically clean. slow and just a bit behind but the food is good if you get it there if you do car side to go it's a major risk everytime,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
9,Gwen U.,"Belleville, IL",8,5,1.0,1.0,2015-06-06,"I wish I could rate no stars. Service, and food the worst I've ever seen!! Went on a dead day and drinks didn't arrive for 20 minutes, food was awful, over cooked, and waitress refused to fill drinks or clean off the super cluttered table!! She spent her time in the corner on her phone and talking to her friends. The manager even came by and I asked for refills and a clean table she relied ""I'll take care of it"". Which never happened. I usually tip my waiter or waitress 50% of the bill. This day I only tipped her 2% with a note of stating how unhappy I was for her terrible service. This is not the first time I've experienced horrible service at this location. Your better off going to saint Louis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
8,A C.,"Belleville, IL",0,44,25.0,5.0,2015-09-08,If you want the best service from this location...sit at the bar and have Schyler as your server/bartender -- he is were the 5 star service rating comes from. Otherwise your service will be extremely hit or miss with the other wait staff. Food wise...typical Applebee's -- not a 5 star meal but no complaints and there is almost always some type of food/drink special so that is a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
11,Beth H.,"Belleville, IL",0,2,,1.0,2016-03-09,"Had enough! Been going for years, and the service and food quality has hit rock bottom. Sad to see great potential run into the ground.

6,Mark H.,"Sparta, IL",1,6,,1.0,2016-12-04,Stopped in early on a Friday evening. They weren't busy yet waitress took forever to even take our drink order. After being ignored by the waitress we left after one cup of coffee without ever placing a food order. Went up the road to Outback and the service was incredibly good. Definitely won't be going back to this Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,

2,Lisa S.,"Swansea, IL",11,27,5.0,3.0,2017-10-03,"I had dinner there tonight with my daughter. While our food was good it is definitely overpriced for the amount. Also, my daughter is a vegetarian and there is very little on the menu for vegetarians. Even the macaroni and cheese has chicken in it!  Add a few meatless dishes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
1,Maureen A.,"Belleville, IL",6,11,,2.0,2017-10-25,"First we were sat at a table right next to the kitchen, waitress station, and bar.  The speaker for the music was directed right at us. We were there early so there were plenty of tables.  Service was ok. My hamburger tasted a little weird.  But when it came to making change we could not figure out what our waitress was doing.  We must have waited 15 minutes for her to pick up the bill and another 15 to get our change.  Needless to say I have no desire to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-swansea-2,,,,,
