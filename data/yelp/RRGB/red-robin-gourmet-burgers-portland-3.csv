Sophy V.,"San Diego, CA",257,4,,3.0,5/12/2017,Service was great. Our server was very attentive and sweet. However the food is okay. The burger was cold and the milkshake was watery. Our brownie dessert tasted like the kind you get from a box and heat it up except ours wasn't a tad bit warm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Ben M.,"Renton, WA",126,12,,2.0,4/25/2017,"We went tonight around 8pm, 4 adults 3 kids. They seated us promptly but there we sat. I don't understand why, when a restaurant is not at all busy it takes forever to get service, then when we do get it our food comes out barely warm, if warm, and our server disappears after telling us they are going to bring fries for one of the kids who asked for them. They were apologetic when they returned and did realized they forgot the fries, and then brought some posts haste. I just don't get it. It's not that difficult, especially when it's not busy. If it were a Friday or Saturday night with a big crowd, then maybe I could see a delay in service and perhaps some warm food but there might have been 10 tables or less...on top of that, when I got my burger, the peppercorn burger, it looked sickened compared to the photoshopped image on the menu, not tasty looking all. I've been here before and had pretty good service and food, so this visit will not deter me from returning in the future in hopes of a better experience. When they are good, they are good!

Rick B.,"Portland, OR",7,9,,4.0,5/25/2017,"Solid menu with a good lineup of beef burgers.  Chicken offerings are very good as well. All come with bottomless fries.  Pretty consistent quality, preparation and presentation are a plus. For a change of pace, try one of their salads.  Local brews on tap.  Outdoor patio right up against Washington/Stark Street A little pricey, but overall, a pleasant dining experience with decent service and a good drink selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Rose E.,"Portland, OR",448,462,2334,2.0,12/15/2014,"I'm still not a fan of Red Robin and this experience was no more impressive than any other visit. I went here on the request of my daughter. There wasn't a huge wait to be seated, but the wait for service was longer than it should have been. The two tables on either side of us arrived later, but were served and left sooner than our table. We all had different servers.  Our server was friendly and personable, but the dishes were dirty. We had to send back the silverware and water glasses because there was food stuck to to them.  The food wasn't to my liking. I had the quac burger, but the quac was some frozen concoction of something like coleslaw only green. We had a chips & salsa appetizer which was about a half cup of chips that were soggy in the middle and burnt on the edges. The salsa was the consistency of having been run through a blender and tasted like it had been mixed with spaghetti sauce.  They don't offer up drink or french fry refills anymore, and didn't offer to let us order desert either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Pui S.,"Amboy, WA",240,633,11658,1.0,10/24/2015,"This was my second time at Red Robin (first time was in Southern California ---- yearssssssssss ago)! And now I remember why!!!!  A small burger with limited fries (in a small metal ring) will set you back over $10.00. Super sweet bottomless Freckled Lemonade (WHATEVER BOTTOMLESS MEANS TO THEM???), will set you back almost $5.00 and they ain't very attentive about refilling it because it happened just once. No, water was served either. Our waiter pulled a desk tablet right out of my hand, while I was looking through the menu (I still gave him 15% just because.........).  I'm pretty sure this is my last time at Red Robin.

So, we were like....ok  (But I cringed) at the thought..see, I've been here before and it was not good.  We all ordered burgers, since it's burger week or something like that..  How do you want your burger cooked ?? they asked. Here is the breakdown; Burger #1 ~  Med...it came well done Burger #2 ~  Med well...it came Med Rare* Burger #3~   Well done...came back Med Burger #4~    Med well....hey got one.  My coworker was not going to eat her Med Rare* burger and I didn't blame her for calling them over to notify the server of this. He just said  oh ok I'll take it back and fix it..we waited... And Waited..and finally we just gave up. finally we just flagged the server and told him it was  now a to go order.... No apology, nothing....it totally was the focus of Our conversation,  instead of talking about life And office stuff we festered over this.....

Tim J.,"Portland, OR",12,32,,5.0,7/6/2017,"Update, haven't been to red Robin in a long time, but boy was it enjoyable. Came here on a very nice day, in a lift car, and boy was my hamburger, nice and fresh. Service was very friendly and attentive at all times, and I was asked if I needed more fries, or another refill on my drink. After I ate, I went outside to red robins nice little handicapped parking lot, and hailed my last Lyft taxi, to head home. That is one of the most beautiful things about red Robin, is that it's not just the food, and friendly service, but it's also because of the fact that they have a handicapped parking spot, and that was perfect for Lyft to park into to pick me up. So, if you have a handicapped, you are definitely in luck if you use Lyft taxi cab service to pick you up, The handicapped parking lot is so large, that lift will just pull right in, and park without a hitch. So, I just have to say, it was a very wonderful visit today here at red Robin, despite it being close to the 90s outside. Very fresh food, and awesome friendly service all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Karey R.,"Portland, OR",97,216,22,4.0,1/10/2015,"Sometime in the last 3 months, this restaurant has had a major renovation.  What an improvement!  The bar area is now clearly signed as 21+ (no kids yay!) and is partially screened off instead of being completely exposed to the waiting area like before.  There is a fantastic decorative chandelier made of brown, green, and clear glass bottles.  The plain wooden stools have been replaced by comfy leather and wood stools.  I think they added more TV's?  It's just much more cozy, sophisticated, and chic than before. The main section of the dining area has been rearranged and the furnishings upgraded.  I only walked through on my way to the bathroom so don't recall too many details but it looks great. I'm sorry to say, though, that the bathrooms were NOT renovated.  The women's bathroom continues to display the primary yellow, blue, red, and white dingy tiles and dilapidated feeling.  Too bad, really.  The bathrooms were always dodgy but now, compared to the rest of the public area, it's a stark blemish.  I hope the bathrooms are next on the rejuvenation list. Food was awesome.  Service was excellent.  I LOVE how I can customize all the meals on the Red Robin website and see nutritional info based on my customizations.  Extremely helpful for a gal on a diet like myself.  We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Jerry M.,"Portland, OR",8,495,1325,4.0,3/26/2016,"Red Robin is well known for their specialty hamburgers with all sorts of extra ingredients embellishing the burger itself.  I'm somewhat of a ""purist"" when it comes to burgers (and I also didn't want to pay over ten dollars!) so I ordered a more ordinary (and less expensive) ""Red's Tavern Double"", which includes just traditional things such as two burger patties, American cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  Red's Tavern Double costs a reasonable $6.99 and also includes ""bottomless fries"". . .a great deal.   OK, the burger was exactly what I wanted, was fire grilled, and was very good.  However, even better (as far as I'm concerned) is that I could substitute ""bottomless steamed broccoli"" in place of the fries.  I have an obsession with broccoli since it is a ""superfood"", so the thought of eating all the broccoli I want was really appealing.  Well, now I know that Red Robin is the place to go for a good burger and to load up on Vitamin A.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=20

Jesus M.,"Vancouver, WA",404,140,777,4.0,8/13/2017,We went to this restaurant location to celebrate my grandson's birthday. We picked Red Robin because my wife likes that they sing to the birthday person and give them a small individual sized Sundae. This location was the closest to the auto headlight repair shop we had dropped my son's car at. We asked for a table for 5 and did not have to wait very long to be seated.  Our drink order was taken quickly and served expeditiously. We ordered the large onion ring tower as an appetizer and that was out fairly fast too. Once our food orders were taken the waiter had refills out to us. Our meals came out except they forgot our two special dipping sauces for the fries.

Sean H.,"Anacortes, WA",57,8,1,4.0,5/12/2017,"Service was great, especially compared to other red robins that I have been to.  We were seated fast, and everyone was friendly.  The food was mediocre, but it wasn't terrible.  We had onion rings, fried pickles and I had a Banzai burger.  I don't know if I'd order these things again, but I didn't send it back to the kitchen...  The lava cake was probably the best part of the meal.   If I had to base this review on the food alone, I would have rated it a 3, but the service will bring me back, if I am looking for a quick burger and am in the area.  I am also taking the class into account, when rating.  I don't consider these to be ""gourmet burgers,"" even though Red Robin claims that they are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3
William L.,"Portland, OR",5,20,10,2.0,2/5/2017,"Arrived to celebrate a birthday and we're not greeted at the door. (Police were standing in the entry... may have been part of the problem) We eventually made our way to the table in the back of the dinning area. (First visit since the rebranding/renovation. Not impressed. Much darker in the entire place.) We had 10 seats to full and a highchair for a toddler. The standard setup looked like it would fit 10 people perfectly and the highchair would sit between the parents. As we started to sit down, the first of two hostesses comes over and asks us to step back and they can add another table for more seating... no one asked for more seats.  After playing musical chairs and moving two tables, we were seated and separated by the giant L shape table we were just crafted. At this point, I was frustrated I couldn't sit near by kids, and they couldn't sit across from their uncle and aunt. We were seated a total of 30 seconds before we were asked if we would want drinks. Greatest moment of the entire service... Brace yourself, it's downhill from here. The kind waitress we had assigned to our table seemed to be overwhelmed by the conundrum created by the tables. After a few minutes of walking through the gauntlet of chairs she was able to get our orders and was gone. We saw her once more when our drinks were delivered and that was it until food was ready.  During the meal, my wife and I had our bottomless fries refilled once, and only one of our lemonades was ever refilled. (I'm still quite parched) My daughter asked for a cheese pizza meal and received pepperoni (and no one responded when we questioned it). Most of the food was good, but far smaller portions than other nearby restaurants for the same price. Overall the food wasn't worth the troubles we had just to be seated. Appreciate the waitress and her effort to make things better but definitely not a visit I want to remember.  Perhaps a one-off bad experience, but this makes two in a row for my family... last time we were here was prior to renovations so let that weigh in on the quality for revisits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3

There were six of us and we sat at a round table with a waiter who had a hilarious and dry sense of humor. He fake pressured us all to get milkshakes and yet we enjoyed getting them.  And I will personally say that if you are going to get a milkshake here, you should get the salted caramel one. It was so perfect in the mixture of sweet and salty.  I had the whiskey River barbecue burger with lettuce instead of a bun and while I could not finish it, it still is a classic favorite.

T B.,"Portland, OR",0,7,17,1.0,9/11/2016,"Who is the Bone Head that ruined the Patio?!  We like the Red Robin Chain. Each member of our family has their favorite burger. We're addicted to the fry sauce. Our server today Jeffery was fantabulous. Very attentive and took good care of us. Our drinks were not allowed to run dry nor were our bottomless fries. Red Robin Restaurants however; are loud. Because of the decor, the din of other diners makes it hard to hear your dining companions talk. We found the perfect solution with the Mall 205 location's secluded patio. The patio sits right off the bar and was a true hidden gem. It HAD full grown shrubbery that let the breeze through yet gave ample shade for the hottest day. The shrubbery provided privacy from the traffic on Washington street and the Mall 205 parking lot. Imagine our horror today to find the patio devoid of any shade or privacy. Yeah, that's exactly what we want, to see and hear all the utility trailers from Home Depot clanking past us while we eat. This is a good example if ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"". Had the idiot who came up with this idea asked staff who had been there awhile, I bet they would have advised not to mess with it. But, as with most organizations, management rarely consults with the front line workers who actually do the work. Not having a secluded, shaded, summer time patio is A DEAL BREAKER Red Robin.

Steve B.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2017,"If I could give this place negative five stars, I would.  What should of been a simple online to-go order turned into one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. In the past, there was a sign near the bar for To Go orders at this Red Robin. Now there is a separate table out front. The problem is nobody seems to be staffing this table. Eventually the hostess came over and asked if I'd been helped, and I said no. She went to get someone from the back who then came out and asked for my name on the order. She went and looked and said that no order came in. This was the start of what would be a very long back and forth I had with multiple employees. I was asked if I could of sent it somewhere else and I said no, I made the online order for this location, with a set pickup time, 100% sure of that. At that point the employee asked what I had ordered and I told her, and she wrote it down, saying they would have to place it manually. After doing this, however, she asked me if I was SURE that I sent the order to the Red Robin on Washington Street. I replied that I'm looking at the order on my phone, and it specifically says the Mall 205 Red Robin. At this point I was getting annoyed and I said I can show you the email on my phone or give you the order number, and she barked no at me and went to go pawn me off on another employee Another woman came out this time who was a little nicer, but once again I was asked if I submitted the order to another location, and I gave the same response.  At this point I asked to speak to whoever the manager is, because apparently I'm not doing a good enough job communicating. Finally, a guy in a suit came out who introduced himself as an assistant manager.  Once again I was asked if I was sure if I submitted the order here, and by this time I was pissed. I came here with a small 2 year old child in tow to quickly pick up a caesar wrap and a kids chicken sticks, and here I am being bombarded with questions on am I sure I placed the order correctly, all the while trying to be a decent parent and entertain a 2 year old. I once again offered to show the email with my order information. The assistant manager went into the back and apparently produced an email they received showing there was an error with my order.  He said the issue was that the error email came in 15 minutes before the pick up time, that they aren't in the back sitting around monitoring emails all the time. I replied neither am I, and I'd already left my house by the time any email would of arrived to me. I was told its a ""technical error"" that happens about once a month, that its not really their fault, and it just sucks that it happened to me. I was asked if I still wanted to order my food. At this point my jaw dropped because an employee had come out and written down the order manually, and I assumed my order would already be going. I mentioned that and he made a comment about not knowing if I really wanted the food, so it hadn't been started. I'm chasing around a fussy two year old and have been here a half hour now, so yeah, I probably do want it. I told him that was ridiculous and I want the name of his manager. I was given a card with a name on it that said assistant general manager but that they aren't in until tomorrow, told me he would take 15% off my order, then slipped away to the back before I could even respond.  I don't know if this person is actually his manager, but it wouldn't surprise me if he tried to dump me on his weekday equivalent. This has very little to do with money to me, as it was just a simple $15 order. The staff could of apologized for the error, offer to take half off the total, make it a priority and whip the order out in 10 minutes. In the end, it took well over an hour to get what should of been a very simple order. I had a two year old child that was running around with poopy pants because it took so long, that wanted no part of waiting around. There was no apology, no taking responsibility by the staff, even worse having multiple employees trying to blame me for the mistake. Most of the employees I interacted with showed little to no professionalism what-so-ever, and its clear this place has gone downhill even faster than I thought. I've never had staff attack me like this and try to blame me for something that was clearly an error on the Red Robin end. I've dined in here before at this location and seen mistakes happen, but the staff at least made an effort to make it right in the past. This time, however, that didn't occur. After all was said and done, I got a pathetic looking caesar wrap that barely had any meat in it, and two of the smallest orders of fries I've ever seen from here which were already cold by the time I even got in the car. I'll be escalating this up as far as I can up the ladder until I reach someone who actually understands customer service, and that this location has some serious problems that need to be looked at and dealt with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3

There is a little menu of dipping sauces that cost 50 cents each and we had the roasted garlic and the green chile varieties. Nothing beats ketchup, but these were a nice break when you're devouring bottomless fries. Our server was attentive and above average for a fast-casual place. We heard the server behind us relentlessly trying to upsell his customers - he obviously took all the corporate training very seriously- but ours was always there when needed and never intrusive and got an above average tip for it.  Sit in the bar for a pleasant screaming kid - free area. There seemed to be a lot of screaming kids coming in and we were glad they offered us the respite of the bar to eat in. Take that, McDonalds!  Of course if you have screaming kids you will feel very welcome here.

Melissa P.,"Portland, OR",10,5,,1.0,11/8/2014,"If I could give negative stars, I would. My family actually ate at this Red Robin multiple times every single week without incident up until tonight. I don't see us EVER returning after the DISGUSTING way that we were treated by the management. We were sitting at our table awaiting our food when the child from the table next to us pounded on our table with both fists.  We were surprised and not happy as we have a 4 and 6 year old who are not permitted to behave that way.  The mother of the child began making comments about how WE HAD A PROBLEM until we finally asked her to stop.  It was impossible to ignore as their table was only about 14-16 inches away from ours.  I asked this woman at least 6 times to just quit talking to me and she called me an obscene name in front of my two small children (as well as her own.)  Both my partner and I said ""Are you kidding?  We have kids sitting here! Just stop talking to us.  Leave us alone!"" This is where Red Robin management really had a chance to shine.  Roger, apparently the manager on duty, approached our tables and without even pausing to find out what was going on told us we need to immediately stop talking.  Yes, just stop talking.  After I was verbally assaulted, called names and harassed in their restaurant, I had every reason to be upset.  My 6 yr old was in tears and visibly very distressed.  Upon his approach, I tried to explain to Roger what had transpired and he actually SNEERED and said, ""Good for you. Now stop talking."" Obviously we decided to leave.  We were basically attacked at our table then the manager comes over and joins in on it??? To add insult to injury, some other person who knew the offensive couple rushed after me as I left and actually grabbed my arm and hissed insults at me while I held my4 year old.  Thanks Red Robin.  I feel so safe in your restaurant after being both verbally and physically attacked.  If Roger wasn't such a dismissive, contemptuous individual I wouldn't blame Red Robin at all, but the response to what happened to me as a regular, frequent patron and HUMAN BEING is beyond unacceptable and ridiculous.  This manager has no business dealing with the public and should be immediately dismissed.BOOOOOOO, Red Robin.

We were seated very quickly and served by a highly enthusiastic waiter.  He must have worked at Chotchkies (think Office Space) in the past, because he started off really hyper annoying.  Eventually he came back down to earth after a little bit, which was good. The meal I got was delicious.  The burger was huge and there weren't too many fries in the basket to really feel guilty about not finishing. Overall, these guys served us a quality meal in record time for a Saturday night.  The final cost was a little bit more than I'd like to pay, but thats the joys of going to restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=80

stephanie b.,"Vancouver, WA",0,27,,1.0,6/16/2010,"I've eaten at Red Robin many times (I have young children who love it!).  I usually eat at the Vancouver locations and have always been pleased with my food and service.   At the spur of the moment, I decided to take my kids to lunch at the one near the old Mall 205.  There are a few things that bugged me...   first of all, when I was seated I noticed a dirty napkin on the floor next to my table that SEVERAL servers walked past and never picked up.  I eventually picked it up after about 15 minutes.   I ordered a hamburger and my kids (age 4) shared a kids' meal.  When our bill arrived, we were charged $1.79 for an extra kids drink.  I politely said to the server, ""has there been some kind of policy change?  I have been to Red Robin 100's of times (other locations) and my kids have always been able to share a kids meal with no extra charge.""  She said she would talk to the manager.   A couple minutes later a man walked up and said he was the manager.  I explained the same.  He said there was nothing he could do and he would only allow them to share a drink if it was the same drink.  **keep in mind that the menu states that it is a ""bottomless"" drink**     What?!?? He would NOT remove the $1.79 charge. I was very disappointed.  At the very least, if he is a real stickler for rules, I would have expected him to remove the charge and say that next time he will have to charge extra.  Obviously, I would not have ordered the extra cup of milk if I knew I would be charged, so he could cut some slack THIS time.  After all, what is his cost for that cup of milk?    The customer is always right, right?  Guess not.  I will not ever return to this store. Rude Manager",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=80
Amy K.,"Portland, OR",19,35,2,1.0,7/2/2013,"Food is good, but the service suuuuuuuucks. Last Sunday afternoon, my husband, son and I met my mother at the Red Robin at Mall 205 for an early dinner. It was about 5pm when we arrived and the place wasn't busy. There were 8-10 other parties there: not crowded. I repeat: not crowded. My mother arrived first, was seated at a smallish 4-top, let the server know there would three others joining her and ordered an iced tea. She sat reviewing her menu and enjoying her drink, with three other menus arranged on the table. Despite that subtle hint, she said the server TWICE came to take her dinner order. She told her, ""I'm waiting for other people, thanks,"" and gestured to the menus. Duh.  When we arrived (about 10 minutes after Mom had arrived) and joined my mother, we were set upon almost immediately (I had literally just slung my purse onto the back of my chair when the server asked if I was ready to order). I was in the middle of greeting my mom and hadn't even picked up the menu yet. Jesus. We placed our order -- two burgers, a bowl of soup, a chicken wrap, drinks and two appetizers (barbecued wings and artichoke dip). From where he was sitting, my husband could see the pass and noted, about 15 minutes after ordering, that he could see our dinners (who else would order a bowl of soup on a 98° day?!). No sign of the apps and no sign of our server.  While our food was stagnating under the heat lamps, our apps arrived. The server set them down with apologies for their lateness, clattering chips across the tabletop. He left TWO napkins and scuttled away. Barbecued wings. FOUR people. TWO napkins.  Before we could even TOUCH the apps (I shit you not -- not TEN seconds had elapsed between one server leaving and the other arriving), our dinners were presented. The waitress scootched the artichoke dip away from my mother to make room for her soup. My mother, fully annoyed, said, ""The appetizers JUST arrived. Couldn't you have allowed for a little time for us to enjoy them?"" The waitress apologized and said, ""Would you like me to take your dinners away until you're done with the appetizers?"" My mother said no, we'd like our dinner to be served hot. Just dumb. We requested more napkins and got a healthy stack for the table.  I quickly filled up on artichoke dip and didn't have room for my burger. I left it, completely whole with NOT ONE BITE from it, in its basket in front of me. Leftovers for lunch on Monday, sweet! As soon as I could find our server and get a box...  We enjoyed our dinner -- the food is tasty as always, but the service was lackluster. When I needed a box for my burger, she was nowhere to be found. My son needed silverware to cut his burger in half. The staff were clustered in a corner nearby giggling and chatting; we had to flag one down to ask for a knife. We had to flag her down again to refill my husband's ice water. When my son wanted more fries, we gave up trying to flag someone down.  After eating for fifteen minutes, a server came to bus the table. He took away the appetizer dishes and reached for my mother's soup bowl when she -- honest to God -- had a spoonful of soup ascending to her mouth. She shook her head, annoyed, and he began to scoop up my burger. MY WHOLE, UNEATEN BURGER. I said, ""Hey, no. I need a box for that."" He returned with a small box (the kind you might fit a cupcake in) and I had to mash my larger burger into it. He then took the rest of our dishes away.  We then sat for -- I COUNTED -- 8 minutes. Our server finally came by to ask how everything was. My mother explained about the mix-up with the apps, the lack of napkins, the absentee service. No explanations, no excuses, no apologies. The server asked if we'd like refills on our drinks. We were very obviously ready to go (purses in laps, debit card in hand, hint, hint) and we had to ask for the check.  The server went to her station, printed the invoice and slipped it into the portfolio. She left it on the table and started to leave. My mother said, ""Can I just pay this now?"" The server seemed annoyed (mind you, it was no busier than when we'd arrived) and took our payment. My mom asked us, ""Was I supposed to take that to the front?"" The server's attitude made her -- the customer -- feel like she'd done something wrong. I assured her, no, they're SUPPOSED to process the payments.  We arrived in GOOD moods and left in BAD moods. Never a good sign. The food again was good. The service has never been great at the Mall 205 location, but now it's positively abysmal. No thanks, Red Robin.  Sorry this is so long. I'm still irritated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=60

Erin R.,"Portland, OR",95,18,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"Man, we are done with Red Robin. This was the last location with ok service. However, the last 2 times its been abysmal. First time, we had a rude waitress who rarely checked in with us and just had an attitude. She then did the entire check-out FOR me on the little tablet, even though I've used them many times before and even told her that. She still did it for me, and I believe it was so I couldn't do the survey at the end. Just rude. Second time, I actually had to get up to find someone to help us. The table next to us apparently had a different server, who wouldn't even glance at us. I pushed the ""call server"" button, which no one really cares about I guess. Talked with the hostess, who was very sweet and took our drink order after waiting for 15 mins. She found our waiter, yet 10 mins later he STILL hadn't stopped by our table. Hostess came by again, apologized and found him. (This place was not busy, I should point out). the guy finally comes over and apologizes like it's not a big deal. Only reason we stayed was because it was my daughters birthday. We didn't even get a chance to let anyone know that, though, because our waiter wasn't around long enough to be told. We won't be going to any Red Robin locations again. It's one of my daughters favorites, but the service is horrible and no one seems to care.

R. C.,"Lake Oswego, OR",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2016,"I regularly, and happily, eat at two different Red Robins on Portland's westside. Recently, I've been to the Washington Street location three times--enough to know that my experience wasn't a fluke. Each time the restaurant was nearly empty, yet it was ten minutes before I saw a server and another 30 minutes to get my food. On the third--and what will be the last--visit, I had limited time and let the host know when he seated me. Ten minutes later, with no acknowledgement from the server in my section, I tracked down another server who was kind and helpful. However, it was still an astonishing 30 minutes before my meal--a plain chicken breast with no sides--arrived. On each visit I  had to ask for silverware and a napkin after my food was served, something other reviewers have commented on. The sidewalk and landscaped area from the parking lot to the front door are littered with trash and literally hundreds of cigarette butts. Waiting to be seated in this family restaurant, along with a family with young children, we were all treated to a bedroom scene on the bar's TV monitor that was aimed at the reception area. My food was comparable to that at other Red Robin locations, but the management is clearly quite different. I definitely will not try a fourth time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=60
