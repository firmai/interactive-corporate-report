But this Red Robin is now CLOSED.  Judging by the looks on the outside (no more sign and closed parking lot), and the sign in the window this place might be closed for good.

Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",375,493,899,4.0,3/7/2014,"My bff and I have been to this Red Robin a few times as it's close to her place. I've always liked their burgers and their BOTTOMLESS FRIES, hello! This time around, I wasn't feeling as hungry and my friend suggested I get a kid's meal. I ordered a kid's Clucks and Fries (chicken tenders) and the portion size was perfect! Two pieces of crispy chicken tenders and fries with a side of their ranch dressing, SO GOOD! And the price at 5 bucks was perfect too!  We were here on a Friday night and it wasn't packed. Our server was a nice gal, very attentive, came around and checked on us, didn't push the bill on us too soon, refilled our fry basket at our request. Plenty of seating inside, booths are nice and comfy. They've got multiple TVs showing whatever game is on at that time. There's plenty of parking on both sides of the restaurant and easy to enter and exit the lots.   I really like this location, maybe a tad more than Topanga. Good comfort food and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas
Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24,3.0,4/3/2014,"Red Robin is very middle-of-the-road, especially in this location. I'm not a huge fan of eating ""gourmet"" burgers (read: anything that doesn't come out of a greasy fast food wrapper) and so the food is good, but never exceptional. I sometimes get their chicken bruschetta sandwich, which often has some unpleasant gristle on it. It seems they are as fond of making it as I am of eating it.  I've tried a few other things lately. The mac and cheese is strangely pungent and not overly worthwhile. Their French onion soup is surprisingly palatable, if not a touch too salty. The salads are nothing to write home about.  For all my commentary about their food, the service here is generally pretty good, and the location sports an outdoor dining area, which is nice. This location will be closing in a few weeks, however, so if you are (bafflingly) a fan of their burgers or other fare, you'll have to hit up the location at the Topanga mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas
Scotty W.,"American Fork, UT",186,410,107,1.0,1/3/2014,"OK let's see here. We stopped on our way home from Yosemite.  Thought this was going to be a good place to eat.  Wow we were dead wrong. First the lady sat us down and then the waiting and waiting started. Our waitress we'll call her Ditzy.  It literally took her 15 min to find us. We were ready to order when she finally got to us. We did not want appetizers or any thing! We had to ask for napkins and refills.  Every time I looked up Ditzy there was talking to friends and not doing her job. It's really a easy job but she failed really bad tonight. I told the manager on duty and all he could say was I'll look into it. This place failed in every way possible. From Ditzy to the Management.  I will never ever come back here again. In the tip space we said ""Slow Service = 20 cents"" maybe she will take her job seriously next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas
Troy H.,"Chatsworth, CA",810,654,195,3.0,9/16/2012,"One of the closer burger chains in Calabasas, I went here to lunch with a couple of friends. I have been to their chain at the Topanga mall as well. They have a variety of different burgers. Their two best in my opinion have to be the Red Robin Gourmet cheeseburger which is garnished with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, pickles, onions, mayo & Red's pickle relish. You choose your favorite cheese: Cheddar, American, Swiss, Bleu, Provolone or Pepper-Jack and their Red Tavern's double which is topped with melted American cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato and Red's Secret Tavern Sauce on a toasted sesame bun, all wrapped in foil to help contain all of this Tavern goodness. I went with the Tavern and it was ok. This was due to the fact it was a bit over grilled and could have spent less time. The fries were good, and I washed it down with an Ice T.  Service was ok, not great. It took more than average time to bring out our burgers and they spent more time refilling our drinks than bringing over the food. So it didn't help when our food arrived the burgers were over-grilled. If it wasn't for the length of time it took to get our food and the over-grilled burgers the fourth star would have been given.  Parking is a non issue. Their lot has plenty of space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas
Amanda B.,"Calabasas, CA",180,674,3511,2.0,10/19/2013,I love Red Robin. This RR is either on the brink of closing or remodel because it is beat. I have been on East Coast time so I ate a very early dinner and the restaurant was empty and should have been spotless but it showed its wear. The bathrooms in particular is pretty gross. The food was fine and dandy. THe seasonal pumpkin milkshake was muy delicious.  Service was pretty bad.

Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,1.0,8/29/2012,"Red Robin... yuck! Sorry, had to do it.  Anyways, this Red Robin was terrible.  I went on  Sunday night and as soon as I walked in I could see the utter disappointment on the staff's face ""Oh no, we have to work??"" There were probably only 2 other customers inside.  It seems like the sunday night crew is used to doing nothing - they were great at it. I should have know it wasn't going to be a good meal at that point - aside from the staff, the place was FREEZING, which is something I've never complained about before and there was a weird musty smell when we walked in. We got seated and waited over 10mins to get our drink orders in.  We placed our food order when the drinks came (4 of us) and waited almost 40mins for dinner.  Shortly after dinner our check arrived  - quickest service of the night. I ordered a turkey burger and it was easily the worst turkey burger I ever had - lukewarm and no flavor.  I've had a turkey burger at other Red Robins and they were all fine. Drink and fry refills were impossible.  Aside from  that, the tables were really run down, some were chipped real bad and broken.  The restroom was disgusting with dirty floors and used paper towels all over the place. This place is poorly run and should be overhauled.  I've never had a bad Red Robin experience before coming here.  The best part of the night was leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas

This last trip I brought my grandchildren. As always, they have a good children's' menu. My grandchildren love the cheeseburger (they actually eat the whole thing!)

Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,583,506,1.0,6/2/2012,"I rarely do this, but I just to have rewrite my latest and not so pleasant experience here at RR.  This is my go-to place and I have been a valued customer for awhile, and I can't even count the number of times I've been here! As a disclaimer, this rewrite has nothing to do with the quality of the food, but the service alone.  Service in my book definitely makes or breaks it in terms of satisfying the customer even if the food could be really bad, customer service will outshadow that problem; however, in my situation the service made the food not taste as good. My issue is with the lack of service that my family and I received upon sitting down.  We were directed to the booth in the outer most corner of the restaurant where at first seemed fine as there were other restaurant goers.  Our waitress was very attentive at the beginning as we were still waiting for one more member of my party and gave us plenty of time for our last person to come and go over the menu.  By the time, the last member of our party came she seemed to have vanished all together as the entire back section of the restaurant was completely empty, and we were the only party in the back.  It became even more odd that our waitress' section was the very front of the restaurant of about maybe 4 tables as ours is in the way back - in my head, it did not just make sense even logistically to have her do one table in the back and 3-4 tables near the front.  She was so occupied with the tables upfront that she barely was around to get us more water, fries, and dipping - it was absolutely ridiculous as I was constantly waving my hands frantically just to have her see me!  What also seemed to bother me was how slow the food came out, we came at 8pm on Friday, and I even asked what time they closed (11pm).  At first, I was being optimistic in the respect that the kitchen is slowing down because they're about to close but 4 hours prior for the food to be slow? That's absolutely ridiculous! And I almost felt rushed as well because the other servers were going to the other empty tables around us wiping them down and refilling seasoning and ketchup - it was honestly such a weird experience.   I'm never sitting in the back ever again nor would I recommend it UNLESS there are other parties around you, if not you mind as well just go up to the kitchen yourself and refill your water, dipping, and fries.  I really do like RR, but if the service is gonna be like this, I might have to reconsider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas

Now the food, I ordered an avocado burger and woah! Where was the avocado?!? o_O there was just a bunch of shredded lettuce, flavorless burger.. I didn't finish it and who could I complain too?

Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,4.0,3/4/2012,"I enjoy a good burger and I enjoy a good lettuced wrapped burger. This place had both. We usually stop by before hitting up the movie theater across the street at the commons. I always order the same thing, A1 peppercorn burger, lettuced wrapped and with a little bit of pink in the middle. Apparently they do not have a medium or temp button on their POS systems. It was a funny conversation with the waiter actually about how you cannot order something medium, you have to specify you want a little bit of pink, that is what they button says that they send to the kitchen.  The burgers always seem fresh, need a little more seasoning but that is what the super awesome seasoning salt is for on the table.

I raised my review from 2 stars to 3 stars because Red Robin took the time to contact me and discuss the bad experience I had, and also sent a gift to apologize. My initial review was 2 stars for the following reasons: The bathroom was very dirty and gross and needed attention. Also the service was and awkward. They forgetting to give us needed and requested items, and we had to wait a long time before we received everything we ordered.  The food was Average, but have had better food there in the past.

Lauren T.,"Westlake Village, CA",73,216,13,1.0,12/7/2012,"Before anyone reads further... this review has 1 star NOT because of the food.  Food was 4 stars...  We took our family of 5 to Red Robin last night... Upon walking in, the hostess took us to the back of the restaurant where there was an ending soccer party group. The server said that was the only place she could sit us and that the party was in the process of leaving... We sat there with the notion that they were all exiting since they were all standing up and kids were RUNNING AND SCREAMING throughout the place...  For 40 mins, I watched kids throwing their shoes all over, running and screaming, throwing chairs down, jumping on booths and the tables, jumping on top of tables and hitting the ceiling, throwing their shoes at the ceiling, throwing shoes and touching their big screen plasma tv's, while the parents of all these children just sat there and MANAGEMENT NOT ONCE came over to stop the AWFUL AWFUL behaviors of these children... Isnt it a health issue when people arent in their shoes??? Isnt it a health issue when barefoot children are jumping on empty booth tables in their dirty barefeet? At what point should a manager step in and say, ""Your party is distrubing other patrons in the establishment, can you please tame it down""... WE has several kids run up to our table and scream in our faces... It was absolutely ABSURD and I blame both the parents of these terribly behaved children and the management for not taking care of their other PAYING patrons in the establishment.  There is NO excuse what so ever for the types of behaviors going on there last night and no excuse management could ever make for allowing such disgusting things that went on in there to go on.... 5 stars would have gone to our server Juan, who I believe really tried hard to keep us happy and taken care of while we were there...

Maybe it's because there isn't one on the Westside? Who knows... Anyway, it's your typical chain restaurant, although this one seems kinda old. I remember going to the Redondo Beach location and being more impressed with the interior - brighter, cleaner, etc. Now that I think about it, that was like, twelve years ago. Maybe they're all the same now. For starters we had Buffalo wings and spinach and artichoke dip. The wings were just ok (all drums was nice) and the dip was pretty standard. Both were loaded with salt, though. I had the Pub burger with fries for my meal, which was a bit disappointing. The burger quality and taste were somewhere between McDonald's and Carl's Jr. The ""ale-braised"" onions were just soggy and the peppercorn ranch didn't taste like anything. Also, most of the cheese ended up stuck to the wrapper rather than on the burger. The endless steak fries were strangely, the least salty thing on the menu and somewhat limp. They needed another thirty seconds in the fryer. At  least the staff was friendly and attentive, that added a star.

I ordered the melon instead of fries, but got fries.  Endless fries.  So many fries, they have to bring some of them first, before your meal.  Soon they will begin bringing them before you order, while you wait for a table, perhaps even before you enter the place.  Someday they will bring a big basket of fries to your home if you consider eating here; later they will bring them whether or not you've ever heard of the place.

The food is mediocre to good depending on what you order. If you're a salad person I would say try another restaurant. The burgers are okay. The buffalo sauce is what redeems this place. The tropical drinks are heavy on the grenadine and not the strongest.  My kids got the grilled cheese with cantaloupe and the mac& cheese with a side of broccoli respectively. Drinks are included in the price of the kids meal. They enjoyed their food. The only thing I would  change is giving them more than one little piece of broccoli with the order of mac& cheese.

Shasta B.,"Calabasas, CA",2,4,,1.0,7/16/2013,"I cannot recommend Red Robin for Celiac -their menu clearly states that everything is prepared in the same area and cross contamination is very likely.  I did not try the gluten free bun as it would be toasted on the same grill as the other buns.  The menu is very unfriendly and when I asked the wait staff, they did not understand any of the concerns, even bringing a salad with croutons.   There are other Gourment Burger places within the vicinity that are far more gluten free friendly and knowledgable.

Jouie J.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",12,66,15,3.0,2/11/2013,This place is okay; service was lacking.  It's got ample space to park and the restaurant is huge.  But the food is just mediocre.  We tried several appetizers and definitely won't be trying the chips and salsa with guacamole.  The guacamole was terrible; tasted like it was from a jar and so did the salsa.  Chips were kinda stale.  Chicken wings were good and their fries were excellent.  As for the rest of the food; it's okay and nothing really screams out on the menu that is different from any other restaurant.  But I do have to insist that the turkey burger is delicious.  If you need a quick fix this is the place to go.  Wish our waitress was a little more attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40
Fergus M.,"Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA",35,172,15,2.0,1/23/2010,"Once again: I hate chain restaurants. However, after seeing Red Robin on the Food Network, supposedly having like 120 topping or something, I thought I'd give it a try. I went with my crazy friend Mimi at work, on a larf, at lunch hour. Okay, there was no list of a ton of optional toppings on the menu. I guessed maybe you could ask for whatever you want. But it not being on the menu was annoying. I can't remember what I ended up getting on the burger, but the meat itself was boring, brown and puck-ish. So regardess of anything else, I can't recommend the burger. And then really, what the hell else matters? The burger wasn't the worst I've had but it was like a big fast food patty. And the horrible decor of the restaurant. Well, it was exactly what you'd expect of a chain. Verdict: edible, I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40

You could see the exasperation on or server's face when she realized the kitchen made us wait for ever for or dinner, and then it was made incorrectly. She apologized a lot, and brought us free sweet potato fries to make up for it (tasty!). The burgers were mediocre, and on the small side, looking not a thing like the pictures in the menu. I mention this because they were really disappointing. Seriously.  The endless streak fries were meh, and the whole experience just dragged on for ever and was a bit overpriced for the quality and (minuscule) quantity of food you get. I have our server  a decent tip though, because she did the best she could with what she had. My advice: get a better burger for less at the Stand on Canoga, or Islands (if you simply must have the busy, noisy family environment).

Jack B.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,35,,3.0,3/15/2009,"Same star rating but I wanted to add a couple of details and possible corrections since I returned recently: -  New Burger:   The Burnin' Love Burger. Silly name (I just point when I have to order something embarrassing like Moon's Over My Hammy-[sans hammy] or a Rootin' Tooty Fresh 'n Frooty) but a delicious sandwich.  Everything is spicy  The bun is more of a crisp roll, speckled with herbs.  The cheese is jalapeno jack.  There is dollop of chunky salsa, and... here's the novel bit... several deep-friend jalapeno medallions.  It is sort of like getting your appetizer on your burger.  The hotness factory is subtle but it stays with you.   - Boca Patty - FAIL! Unfortunately, Boca Patties do not do well in most restaurant environments.  They are usually overcooked and hard around the edges.  Microwaving is the best method for cooking these at home and depending on your waiter, you might want to ask that your patty is handled thus rather on the grill.  The Gardenburger patty turns out better, but the flavors somewhat conflicting.  - Onion Ring Sauce - In my earlier review I mentioned that the two sauces served with RR's exceptional onion ring ""tower"" are ranch and a thousand island variant.  In reality, it is ranch and a very good barbecue sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40

The food is always good here and the fries are perfection. Try the oreo shake.

Shannon F.,"San Francisco, CA",72,342,2,2.0,5/3/2007,"They used to be a fine establishment. I remember the days when my dad would take my brother and me to Red Robin for a fulfilling brunch that always ended with the musty smelling Robin himself handing me a balloon.  This location is practically worthless as far as I'm concerned. The last time I went here was because I had eaten at an incredible Red Robin many many miles away and it was fantastic. So, wanting to dine in the mild warmth of a late spring evening, Natalie G., my sister, and I sat on the patio of Red Robin, perusing the menu.  Our waiter was much less than attentive. This was my first tip off that my dining experience was not going to be a good one. He came by once before we ordered and asked if we needed anything. I said, ""Napkins, utensils, and water for starters,"" as he half-heartedly listened and then walked away. It really was not busy, just a few families, a couple of strays here and there dining. Shortly into being seated we became the only ones on the patio. Then, the lights on the patio went out. Yup, out. Our server came back out (probably ten minutes later), not even noticing that it was much darker, supplying us with our long awaited waters and useless silverware. He was about to turn and walk back inside when I notified him that we were in fact ready to order, and inquired about the darkness. He took down our orders, burgers, and said that he'd see what was up with the lights. Twenty minutes later, after finding our waiter inside attending to other patrons, I inquired about our food, to which he replied, ""I'll check"", disappeared, and I went back outside to find that the lights were back on, for the moment. The fellow brings out our food, forgetting the sides we had asked for, and one entire dish that my sister had requested. Our food was luke warm, obviously having been sitting awaiting a pickup these twenty minutes. It tasted horrible, like stale bread and low grade beef. Our fries were cold and soggy. The lights went back out five minutes into trying to eat. My sister's food never came, and neither did the waiter. I had to find him to request our check. I also asked for a manager, who was no longer on duty.  The second star in this review is because I called the next day to complain. The manager was extremely kind, calling me back within a half hour and professing his deep regret for my dining disaster. He invited all three of us back for free meals, requesting that we ask specifically for him. That was really nice, but there's no way I'll be back. A shame indeed, morphing from an enjoyable eating establishment into a disappointing pile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40
