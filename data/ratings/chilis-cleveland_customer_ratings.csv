27,Aaron B.,"Cleveland, TN",17,15,1.0,2.0,2012-12-06,"Really?! You need a review of Chili's?! It's the same as everywhere I guess. This one seems pretty slow, though as far as Chili's go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
17,Gary N.,"Chattanooga, TN",3319,651,2164.0,2.0,2013-02-13,Reviewing this even before I get my food.  Place so cold I can barely type. If you dare come here do not get seated near windows with air conditioner overhead. Now it is 35 degrees outside and I have the AC freezing my a$& off.  The food better be damn good or this will drop to s one star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003
23,Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97.0,1.0,2013-03-02,"Who put the new guy on? The new employees should not work on Fridays... They should work at Friday's... Ewww! We got this guy who had no clue about menu items. There was a bright spot, we got a girl who said she was our waitress when she brought our drinks. Then she never came back. WTF? The food was the same Chili's stuff you get anywhere prepared half heartedly by someone who didn't really care and served by the clueless. Too bad... I really used to like Chili's. They need undercover boss to go out and figure out where the problems are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
25,Andrew C.,"Cleveland, TN",45,20,,3.0,2013-08-09,Go to this Chili's often. This place has gone down hill from what it used to be. I still go because the food is still decent. The service is up or down. sometimes you get a great server and sometimes you get a terrible server. The food is usually pretty consistent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,,,,,
15,Shaylee S.,"Cleveland, TN",22,53,8.0,1.0,2014-04-23,"I'm aware that the service here is horrible and works at a snail's pace but I won't be returning after my last visit: Went with my aunt for lunch, was probably about 1:30 and it wasn't very busy. She ordered the lunch combo of a salad and flatbread, I got a Sante Fe salad. It should be noted we ate here maybe 3 weeks ago and my aunt ordered a lunch combo salad and soup last night. The waiter brings her a salad in a TINY bowl (I will be adding a pic) We were both awestruck at first thinking it was joke. The cup of sauce was almost 1/3 the size of the salad. It would have been soup if she used the whole thing. There couldn't have been more then a few bits of lettuce. I've never seen a salad in these bowls before, they have always been served on square plates. After about 40 minutes of waiting I got my salad and she got her flatbread. My salad was about $10 and was also very small. It was served on a long rectangle plate which is really inconvenient for a salad. We got to speak to the manager who wasn't particularly nice about the situation. She claims the lunch salads have always came in this tiny bowl which is a blatant lie when we received the same lunch salad a few weeks ago that was full size. She brought me more lettuce and my aunt another salad. Not happy and this restaurant has officially made it to my blacklist of restaurants I will not go to ever again. I have a hunch that the new guacamole addition to the menu brought in these new bowls and they figured they could shrink the salads by throwing them in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
21,J H.,"Athens, TN",1,22,17.0,1.0,2015-01-31,The customer service at this place is absolutely atrocious!!! I've never not left a tip for my server... Until now. They are lucky I paid at all! It took me 45 minutes ( 45 MINUTES!) to get an order of nachos. After I finally got my food I never saw my server again. No one came to check on my table at all. After sitting for another 20-25 minutes waiting to get my table cleared. I had to go get a bus boy to find someone to bring me my check. The decent food does NOT make up for the TERRIBLE SERVICE I experienced here. I will NEVER eat here again. I recommend everyone stay away from this Chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,,,,,
18,Scott D.,"Cleveland, TN",0,12,2.0,1.0,2015-04-27,"Sitting at the bar as I write this. Stopped for a cocktail on my way home. 7 minutes before I was aknolaged and served. There are 4 people at the bar besides myself. I was served a very well poured drink as it is happy hour. As I look around I notice the bar area is very unclean. The bar has not been wiped down the entire time I have been here, there are empty glasses and a plate sitting on the bar. I have watched staff walk by litarlly 30 times look and not take the plate or glasses to the kitchen. There are two cartons of orange juice that the bartender brought from the kitchen that have been sitting above the refrigerator for 35 minutes. This is by far the worst Chili's I have ever been too. If the front of the house is this unsanitary I can not imagine what the kitchen looks like  Eat here at your own peril. Just an update ordered 1 more drink, the plate was finally taken to.the kitchen but 7 empty glasses sitting on the bar and still no one has wiped down bar area. Very unsaitary. Would not recommend",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
22,John I.,"Cleveland, TN",7,15,,3.0,2015-07-12,Chicken was cold had very hard could not eat. Very cold inside better take a coat. Service ok took few moments to get drinks. Try another place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,,,,,
19,Heather H.,"Calhoun, TN",0,8,2.0,5.0,2015-09-23,"The cajun chicken pasta is amazing. Especially with shrimp! Also love the big mouth bites, skillet mashed potatoes, and the sirloin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
6,Steven L.,"Southaven, MS",3399,1121,8257.0,2.0,2015-10-20,"I called them on phone and asked about Happy Hour Specials. He didn't know so he gave me somebody who knew a little bit more, but still not enough. They need more education and training.  Once arrived, no one was at bar. So I waited.  Getting impatient here. A few more minutes go  by and some one comes out and I look at her, and they immediately look away although they are behind bar. Then somebody else comes out and I think they are the bar tender and she ignores me too. She pours a couple beers for some customers and then, goes to kitchen. So, I been here about 7 minutes and nobody still hasn't spoke to me yet.  Finally, somebody comes out and comes up to me. I ask her about Happy Hour specials and want a menu for that. She says they don't have one. She rambles off a few happy hour hour food items. In summary, they need a happy hour food menu. There's just to many problems what's on special and not. She mentions the new digital monitors in front of you has it but further states not all are on special. This makes it confusing. She's not friendly either and never smiles.  Also it's kinda cold outside and they have the AC on. So I'm cold and - I have a long sleeved shirt on. I ain't coming here no more. I wished I had gone to BWW. I would have had a better time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
24,Rick M.,"Cleveland, TN",0,19,,2.0,2015-11-05,"I like Chili's, but the service at this location is slow for no apparent reason. I have eaten here when 3/4 of the tables are empty, and it takes forever to get served. When we want Chili's, we drive to Chattanooga where the service and food are always excellent regardless of what time we visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,,,,,
11,Doug B.,"Riceville, TN",5,75,,4.0,2015-11-24,"Well I got my comeuppance tonight! Went in with low expectations, I just wanted to go somewhere different. Prepared myself for a mediocre meal because I haven't had a lot of luck with chains like Chili's, Applebee's, TGIF...  I was wrong, I had a really good experience all the way around.  I had the table-side guacamole for my entree. The chips that came with it were fresh and hot. The salsa was just right, with a little kick, very tasty. I asked about the black beans to see if they were vegan. Our server, Tristan, was knowledgeable, and suggested that I get the beans and the rice, which would cost less than the beans alone as a side. The rice turned out to be a winner, touch of lime and well prepared. The beans were well seasoned and topped with good stuff. The guacamole itself was delicious, and a generous portion. My wife had a Southwestern Chicken salad, which she enjoyed, although it may have been a little spicy for her taste. The service was very professional, right on target at every turn. Just great.  Nitpicks on my part ... lousy selection of draft beer, would be nice if they had one or two craft beers. Funny that they have table side monitors that you can use to order or pay your bill, but no wi-fi. The bar area is small, but nice, and it wouldn't be a bad place to sit and surf for awhile. Nice surprise for me. Reminder to be open minded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
13,Adrienne B.,"Cleveland, TN",0,6,1.0,1.0,2015-12-02,"A roach ran across my plate, last experience. I decided to give it another try. Bad choice.  After ordering our food, we waited an hour. We were eventually offered our food to go. They wanted us gone? Anyway...... Once we took our FREE, to go, food home...it wasn't even right. WTF? We won't ever visit Chilis, again. Y'all suck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
20,Mike W. S.,"Huntington, WV",0,5,,4.0,2015-12-08,It's about the best you can hope for at a chain restaurant. Bartenders seem pretty solid. Menu is also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland?start=20,,,,,
16,Randy P.,"Cleveland, TN",12,14,21.0,2.0,2016-05-01,So for the greasiest sit down food chain restaurant in Cleveland look no further. The slow forgetful staff make the experience all the more pleasant. Avoid the ribs unless you want to spend all night in the bathroom instead of with your significant other. Actually avoid everything. Even the nachos have grease dripping from them. I hear the bar is not so bad. If you want to get ripped and have explosive diarrhea this the place for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
9,Cris A.,"Toronto, Canada",34,58,155.0,4.0,2016-05-04,"Decided to sit in the bar area as the place was quite packed for dinner. They had a great deal with half rack ribs which finished off with dessert. Just went for the regular sauce but they had a few to choose from. We also ordered a new option, the prime rib tacos. It was delicious. Cheap for the size and filling quality. Very filling. Also ordered the Tito's Punch. Fresh fruit with rum and vodka. It was yummy! I thought it was great how we both got ID'ed to ensure we were both of age which I have never seen any bars do ever. The only downside was our food taking so long to be prepared because their was an error in the order and they brought us a burger instead of the ribs. It got fixed eventually. Was sad they didn't have any Awesome Blossoms!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,

3,Esther F.,"Tunnel Hill, GA",185,132,590.0,3.0,2017-01-08,I always enjoy eating here for the simple fact that they have a predictable menu and relatively good service... love the crisper and the salads as well as the fajitas and pasta...they always have great prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
14,Amanda N.,"Cleveland, TN",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-01-16,"Bad service in the ""to go"" area made to wait an hour an a half at the crowded bar for order the girl was rude. Not acknowledging you have waiting customers is rude she was being hateful as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
10,Katie Q.,"Cleveland, TN",75,17,18.0,2.0,2017-03-17,"Tonight I came with my sister and friend to eat some dinner and celebrate my sisters friends bday.  It's also st Patrick's day. I myself can't drink alcohol bc I am pregnant. The waitress said they didn't make virgin, non alcoholic drinks. So I got a water. Usually places have them. I was disappointed. She said she would be back to take our order and then got caught up at another table so another waitress came by. She seemed way more knowledgeable and was very surprised that we were told they didn't make virgin drinks. So I ordered a strawberry drink. They returned with our drinks. I was excited. It tasted good. And then a few sips in, the second waitress who took our order returned and swiped the drink from in front of me, and disappeared to come back and say they had made it with alcohol and she couldn't let me drink it. Kinda funny but odd. I didn't taste any alcohol honestly. But thankful she caught it. The original waitress didn't help take any of the dishes off the table and we had to make room and fumble to pay. She could have offered to take my sister and friends extra empty drink glasses. Or even tried to say anything about there actually being a drink made with no alcohol. She finally returned at the end of our meal and quickly spouts out what our checks would be separated like and then returns and we had to check to make sure. Just an odd night I hope",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,
1,Shahira S.,"Cleveland, TN",137,96,275.0,5.0,2017-05-06,"This place is like my personal Cheers... singing theme song ""where everybody knows your name...."". I'll stop... Back to our regularly scheduled review. It is reliable tex-mex/ american food. They often have specials on bar food and drinks that are  awesome Sunday-Friday. I think bogo on is every day all day until 10pm on house ,premium drinks and beer  The decor is most like every other modern Chili's, and since this is a university town majority of the staff are college students. Very energetic and I always receive excellent customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,,,,,

7,Dawniel K.,"Cleveland, TN",0,4,3.0,4.0,2017-07-20,"Probably one of my favorite places to eat! The menu has great variety and can please about anyone. Chili's is very reasonably priced too. I love the burgers, the crispy asparagus, and you have to have the skillet chocolate cookie!  I enjoy the atmosphere and it is always clean.

4,Tammy B.,"Etowah, TN",13,9,11.0,1.0,2017-10-23,"I like Chili's been here many times & is for the most part pretty good until Sunday night 10/22 17. We got seated & the table was so wet when they seated us that the back of the menus were actually dripping water from where it had been wiped down I guess. We got it dried off & we dried the backs of our menus & ordered our meal. When she brought our food & started to set my granddaughters pasta down she immediately said ""no no""......as she could see the long hair in it before it ever got set on the table. We realize this can happen but we didn't want to eat there after this. They really need to wear hair nets when preparing food so this does not happen....its gross!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
2,Jarita M.,"Chattanooga, TN",10,11,13.0,2.0,2017-12-22,"Something is just WRONG at this location.  The servers don't seem to generally care, the managers are usually defensive, and there's no wireless. Who doesn't have wireless for their customers nowdays? People who aren't plugged in to their customers, that's who. The bench seat was greasy, and our server let me stand there instead of asking if I needed something. When I stopped him to let him know, he did a couple other things for tables while I stood in the middle of the restaurant, then with zero eye contact, much less a smile, wiped it down hurriedly and left. I waited for a hostess, and she dried it off. We had to ask for silverware twice.  I could go on, and this is certainly not the first time.  Something needs to change here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleveland,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
