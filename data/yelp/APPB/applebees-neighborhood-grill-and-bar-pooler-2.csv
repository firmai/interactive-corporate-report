LaToiya P.,"Savannah, GA",130,3,7,5.0,4/30/2016,Fresh and clean. Love the new look and it has a nice vibe. It's like a lounge all in one.  JJ the Bartender is the coolest here in Pooler. #ApplebeesInPoolerWhereItsCooler,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Manny N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",78,119,23,4.0,3/11/2016,"I read the reviews before I came in so I made sure to be at Applebee's before 5 p.m.  When we got there the place was pretty empty and happy hour had just started great deals, awesome boneless chicken wings and Chicken Wonton Tacos. Unfortunately the signature sauce they put on some of their sandwiches is terrible, so if you get one of those sandwiches tell them to put the sauce on the side or 86 it all together. Good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
John K.,"Parachute, CO",5,6,,3.0,9/16/2016,"Watch out for flies in your food.  Tastes like cafeteria food. Soup came out cool, not hot.  Food was not very tasty. Management gave a free ice tea for the fly problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Jiahua L.,"Pooler, GA",25,26,18,4.0,4/4/2016,Lovely and neat interior. It is different from other applebees,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Amy B.,"Pooler, GA",2,14,11,5.0,2/16/2016,"I haven't really liked Applebee's since the 90's. Always with the stale smoke and fermented carpet smell. That changed today. It seems this company has got their act together! Awesome starts at the door. There is booth and pub style bar top seating. Employees are happy to be here serving. Sure they are getting paid to be, regardless they are happy. Kendra was our server. Was very knowledgeable and failed to stumble telling us about everything new and improved. I am proud to be your patron today. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Jenn F.,"Pooler, GA",67,19,14,5.0,6/11/2016,This was by far the best Applebee's I've ever been to! I've been to Applebee's restaurants all over California and Arizona and just moved to Pooler and was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant! The staff was super friendly and treated my husband and I so great. Everything in here was brand new and so clean! The food tasted amazing and they gave us time to eat our appetizers before our meal came. We will definitely continue to go back to this location!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Jake T.,"Pooler, GA",7,19,4,5.0,8/6/2016,"We went for lunch on a Saturday. Wasn't crowded, no wait. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Definitely a place to come back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Andrew C.,"Springfield, GA",1,13,,2.0,4/2/2016,"Terrible, went here because of all the good reviews and was disappointed. Ordered a appetizer and it didn't come out until an hour later with our food and this was at 3 p.m. Mine, my wife's, and my son's food were all wrong. Waitress was slow, only reason I left 2 stars instead of 1 is because the burgers was halfway decent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Hassan A.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/8/2016,"Horrible service, and my to go order was all wrong and I did not notice until I got to the hotel. I paid extra for sweet potato fries and did not get them at all. Aside from this, I ordered an American standard burger with everything on it and received it with NOTHING on it. No cheese, no onions, no pickles, no bacon. It was just a burger and two buns. The oriental salad looked like it was tossed together in 30 seconds with barely any chicken on it. This is the first negative review I have ever written in my life, but I was so upset with the experience I can guarantee that I will never eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Ray R.,"Port Wentworth, GA",27,23,5,5.0,3/1/2016,Good service (Shari). Drinks were good. Food was served hot. We'll have to try this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Maria E.,"Savannah, GA",27,12,18,5.0,2/18/2016,"The New Applebee's by the Tanger outlet in pooler was amazing.. My son and I went for lunch thinking it would be the typical Applebee's experience, but it was better than i had expected.. From the Hostess to the Server everyone was pleasant and upbeat. the manager was freely roaming checking on guests, running food and making sure everyone was enjoying themselves.. This new version of the Brand is  different in that they cut their meat in house and cook over a wood flame grill. He had the Triple bacon burger which was huge.. bacon seared inside the meat and more bacon and cheese on top. I had the Parmesan Shrimp and Steak with the sweet mashed potatoes and fire grilled veggies.. yum steak cooked perfectly and juicy not need for additional condiments.. definitely going to make this a regular spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Stuart W.,"Rincon, GA",27,11,,1.0,2/22/2016,"We went to this location Sunday the 21st. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated which was not bad considering how busy as they were. Once we were seated it took 10-15 minutes for someone to come to the table to take our drink order. While we were waiting for the drinks to come back the manager came to the table to take our order. After waiting over an hour for our food the waiter came to the table and told us the food would be there in 6 minutes. 10 minutes later he came back and said the food would be there in 7 minutes. At this time, we requested that the kids food come out first if it was ready because they were starving. Finally, after waiting an hour and a half the kids food came out. They had ordered pizza and it looked like it set under the warmer for a while. About 15 minutes later all of the food except for my father-in-law's came out. The manager asked if we needed anything else and I had to tell them that we were missing my father-in-laws steak. The manager finally brought my father-in-law's steak and even though he ordered it medium-well, it was burnt. I had ordered a clubhouse grill. It also looked like it had set under the warmer for a while. The barbeque sauce was congealed and the bread was soggy. I told the manager he could take it back without even eating any of it. The manager did not apologize, but they did not make us pay for anything. The waiter kept apologizing over and over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20
Martin S.,"Springfield, GA",0,3,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Haven't ate at an Applebee's in a long time so I thought we would give it a shot. Took over an hour to get our food. Couldn't find the waiter half the time. The drinks were weak. When we got our food it was cold. Took one bite out of my steak and spit it back out. It was by far the nastiest steak I have tried. I told another waitress to get the manager because our waiter couldn't be found. Once the manager came, I told him to throw the food away. He asked a ton of questions as to why the steak was so bad, Instead of taking ownership of the hour long wait for food. He never even apologized and was more worried about taking the steak back and offering something different that would ""be out super fast"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2?start=20

Johnny L.,"Savannah, GA",265,6,12,4.0,12/31/2017,"If your looking to have some chill food after a long day at the .all, this is where you should go. Especially being that it is next door tanger outlets. We happened to walk in during happy hour 3-6pm and  select appetizers were half off. It was perfect timing as well as the dollar long islands they've been promoting. The waiter kept checking on us and the food was prompt. The atmosphere was very alive which is perfect to just come eat and hang  out. Even better we used the tablet at the table to pay and split our meal. No wait or anything. Fast and efficient service made the time fly by. Thank you Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Karen R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,1.0,11/26/2017,"We were in there Saturday, 11/25 and were very disappointed with the service being leaving a lot to be desired. Waited at least 15 minutes just to get a waitress, only after talking to the manger. The manger took our drink order and then the waitress came over and very quickly disappeared.  We only got appitzers but were ignored for the most part. The pretzels were very good and the little sundae was good, but the other stuff was cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
LaTia M.,"Savannah, GA",60,95,256,4.0,11/24/2017,"Not a real fan of the meals here, but the happy hour specials seem to pack more flavor. Drinks are good as well; just be specific in what you want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Nicole B.,"Pooler, GA",0,2,,4.0,12/9/2017,"Not bad for a Saturday night. Wait wasn't terrible and food came fast .... our waiter, Wiggly .. was great!!! Always a good time when you don't have to deal with attitudes!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Madison P.,"Bowling Green, KY",11,231,152,4.0,8/29/2016,"One of my all time favorite casual places to eat. Our Waiter was a very friendly guy.  He knew I was a Detroit Red Wings fan by the cap I wear. Plus I found out he was originally from Michigan.  We talked a bit about days of  fun in the cold and snow.  I really liked my broccoli and mashed sweet potatoes.  The Sweet Potatoes didn't have loads of butter and sugar; great job.  The Pork Chop was crisp outside and moist inside. I was shocked that my Husband actually opted to have vegetables for his sides and ate them. Let me say a word about the Raspberry Cosmo.  It sneaks up on you.  I was going to have another.  However, by the time I finished the first one I thought no or else I would need my Hubby to  lead me around.  I definitely want more of that drink soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Bryony H.,"Savannah, GA",2,76,319,3.0,7/22/2017,I went during late night happy hour where the appetizers and various drinks are 1/2 off. The restaurant is clean but then again it's pretty new. The food was hot and average (it's Applebees). Overall of you're looking for a late night place for a quick get together stop in. Do not misconstrue this place for anything other than a slight upgrade to fast food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Lena T.,"Silver Spring, MD",10,58,83,4.0,8/22/2016,Ate here after leaving the Tanger Outlets. I have never had such excellent service! Our server Brittany was beyond excellent. Friendly attentive and well mannered...almost to a fault. Applebee's has really stepped it's game. The new design is awesome and very modern! Really impressed. We orders the 2 for $20 (2 entrees and an appetizer) we ordered the Asian chili boneless wings for the app and baby back ribs and butchers steak meal. All was delish! Dis fruta!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Matthew M.,"Lewisville, TX",61,13,7,5.0,5/5/2017,"I met a friend here for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was and I left stuffed. Our server Jessica was very fun and polite, really nice to have good service even at lunch time. The building has a new style that I hadn't seen before, modern and clean, we sat outside and there were nice cushioned outdoor chairs and made for a nice place to catch up on old times. Overall very happy and would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Kaitlyn N.,"Savannah, GA",105,6,,3.0,10/6/2017,Food was great. Service was extreeeemely slow- very understaffed at this location. Went around 1PM and didn't leave until 3PM. Took 25 minutes just to get our drinks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Jacob S.,"Middletown, RI",13,6,,2.0,3/19/2017,"The WORST bathroom ever. Was here last year same time and the bathrooms are he same, disgusting. Managing needs to wake up.

Kim S.,"Port Wentworth, GA",56,5,5,3.0,6/10/2017,"Server was excellent. However, food was not that great. Appetizer was a bit cold. Entree bourbon chicken and shrimp was okay.

Tawana C.,"Pooler, GA",30,47,97,1.0,8/26/2016,Nice ambiance service is horrible my family waited one hour and 30 minutes wait for to receive our dinner. The waitress didn't have a clue what going on with our food while we wait for the food to come out  stop the manager asked how everything and told him it was horrible services we were having that night. He a apologized about the bad services .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Holly M.,"Savannah, GA",3,19,21,5.0,5/22/2017,"I am so surprised to say that I came here for dinner on a whim with my husband on Saturday night. We hit quite a bit of traffic on our way to Pooler and were looking up places to eat that were still open at 10 pm. We decided to try this new Applebee's but also knew that our prior experiences at other Applebee's locations have been less than ideal. However, with their prices, we decided to give it a shot. The reason I am surprised is because we both loved our food! We did the 2 for $20 deal, starting with the spinach and artichoke dip which we had no complaints with. Then, I got the cedar grilled chicken with broccoli and quinoa - it was seasoned well, flavorful, and healthy. I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture! My husband got the caprese chicken with mashed potatoes and finished every bite. What really makes this a five-star review is the service. Everyone we came in contact with was so friendly and kind, especially our server. She was so helpful in telling us about new drinks and menu options and checking on us as needed. I would definitely come back here if we are in Pooler which again, is not how I was expecting to feel so that makes it even more worthwhile. The environment inside was also the best one we have seen so far, so kudos to Applebee's for stepping it up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Joseph A.,"Austin, TX",211,154,48,5.0,4/24/2016,"Had a great experience eating lunch here. I loved the ambience, the décor, and the food. We were promptly seated despite it being relatively packed. All the staff were friendly and accommodating. Our food was delicious, even for a chain, and came out quickly. This Applebees seems to be better managed than others I've been to. Overall enjoyable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Reesey H.,"Pooler, GA",0,63,4,2.0,4/21/2016,This location is horrible. The server took forever to ask what we were drinking. Then it was another 5 mins before the drinks came out which were all water. Then a different server came to take our food order and we didn't receive it until 30 minutes later but our mashed potatoes were cold. It was Wednesday and there were not many people in there so we were hungry and frustrated by the time the food arrived. I probably won't eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Georgia S.,"Bloomingdale, GA",5,54,13,2.0,6/1/2016,Ok did you folks get complacent?  The food was a far cry from the first time we came to this store. The burger my hubby had was just plain weird. It was hard and the bun was soggy. Keep in mind there were no tomato or lettuce on the burger. The chicken tacos seemed to have lost the chicken on the way to our table. The slaw and the wonton shells were great so not quite sure what happened. Told our waitress our concerns and she said she would send the floor manager over. 20 minutes later we paid the bill and left. Two stars as our waitress was good and tried to make it right. I never hold the wait staff responsible for the kitchen unless they don't bother to address customer concerns. All in all may give them another chance because of her.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
Kelly M.,"Pooler, GA",33,4,,1.0,12/24/2016,"We used car side pick up. 20 minutes after our scheduled pick up time no one had come to even see about us. We finally went in and they were just boxing up our food. We had paid with two gift cards on the app but they needed the cards again. Then they proceeded to keep the one with 29$ left on it until we spoke to a manager. By the time we got the food home (5 min away) it was cold and almost inedible. No apology, nothing! Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pooler-2
