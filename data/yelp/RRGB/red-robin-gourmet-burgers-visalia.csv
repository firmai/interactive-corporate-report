Anabel M.,"Delano, CA",0,2,1,5.0,9/17/2017,"Red Robin is absolutely amazzzing! I never get tired of this place. Their bottomless steak fries alone hits the jack pot, but now their burgers on the other hand are out of this ball park! The most flavored burger I've tasted than any other restaurant. As good as this place is not all their food on the menu is tasting. The chicken burger wasn't what we expected a little dry so my husband took it back and exchanged it for a burger. Other than that the rest of the food was great.  The only thing I do have to add is it's very affordable, but their strawberry lemonade is quite pricy. It's almost $4.00!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Monica P.,"Visalia, CA",96,90,232,5.0,1/5/2018,"As far as burger joints in Visalia go, this is probably as popular as in n out. Never a dull time at this place! I usually opt for the classic fav, the clucks and fries, but I decided to live a little and got the Taco Tavern double. Man o man I was not let down! It tastes just like a GOOD taco truck taco in a burger. And of course the bottomless fries are a plus. I also got this new drink that is called Titos cream soda. It's Tito's vodka and your choice or orange or raspberry cream soda. Trinity, our waitress, makes the best ones! She was also great with asking if we needed more fries or another round of those delicious cream sodas! My hubby always gets the clucks and fries and he's rated them the best in town in his book. Plus if you sign up for their rewards program, every 10th burger or entree is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Dara R.,"Exeter, CA",52,287,224,5.0,1/1/2018,"My pervious review of Red Robin being a mediocre chain restaurant is no longer the case. My husband is a big lover of their burgers so after a full morning of shopping, I let him have his way and we came in here for lunch. Let me just say that the remodel isn't the only improvements recently made here. Our server was on top of his game. Fast, friendly and efficent. We never waited for refills, or our check. I decided to try the ghost pepper tavern burger. My burger was out of this world delicious! Perfectly cooked, seasoned and very spicy as I'd hoped. The fries were so fresh! Piping hot and damn good. I don't remember the name of the burger that my husband ordered but he was also happy as a clam with his meal. Prices are great, seating is cozy and comfortable, and the service was stellar. Looking forward to coming back again sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Brian T.,"Tulare, CA",172,89,121,4.0,11/8/2017,Red Robin is always strong - particularly in value. The quality of he food is good- but the value is great. Unlimited fries is a always a nice touch. Ample TVs and a friendly family atmosphere. This one on Visalia is frequently packed- today I got right in which was nice. I had the A1 perper corn burger which was decent. No complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Ronnie S.,"Selma, CA",183,51,306,2.0,6/17/2017,"I truly have a love hate relationship with this place It was once upon a time the best place to get a restaurant burger but that was yeeeeeaaaaaarrrrsss ago like the 90's. Especially this location. So cool to be opened up on one side to the mall you can watch passers by and if you're passing by peer into the restaurant. You see Over the years the portions have just gotten too small. So small in fact I cringe at the sentence ""let's go to Red Robin"" .  I don't enjoy my dining experiences here anymore at any location. Our service was Good and the ambiance is toned down and chill so yeah it is what it is",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Alondra S.,"Chino, CA",160,15,21,5.0,1/4/2018,"I came in tonight with a party of 9, we were greeted with a great attitude by our server Stevie. He got us drinks, and complementary fries right away. As appetizers we got the onion rings which were crispy and delicious. For meals most of us did the sir acha tavern double which was delicious as well. We devoured it so rapidly we became full so quick. Stevie did a great job on keeping an eye on refilling and offering more drinks. The bottomless French fries kept coming as well, my family and I definitely enjoyed our experience there. Overall food was really good and having Stevie as our server made our experience 10xx better. I would say it is better than our Chino Hills location. Next time when we come up for vacation, we will be requesting Stevie as our server my family enjoyed him serving us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia

Tonight we had a party of 12 and a few complicated orders. Our waiter was enthusiastic, funny, and very polite. His name is Michael and he told us he has only been working here 2 Weeks.

Devin B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,2,1.0,12/18/2017,This was by far the worse Red Robin ever. It's very confusing when you walk in. The menus are missing items. I even asked for another one and it also was missing stuff. The food was not typical of what I have had at other Red Robin's. The places has more seats then it can handle. The waitress didn't even listen to the order on the drinks. What more can I say not a good representation of other Red Robin's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Pedro P.,"Visalia, CA",50,94,76,5.0,6/5/2017,My Order # 72744656 and I placed it tonight. I want to say what a exceptional service I had from the bartender when I picked up my order. She had short blonde hair.  From the moment I walked in she went and checked on it and told me it would be a few. She went to check on one of her tables and then went back and brought me out a cup full of fries for my ride home and then minutes later came out with my order. She verified everything was cooked and made to order and even brought out sides of ranch even though I hadn't asked for them yet. I have to say it was my best experience ever anywhere. She was quick and prompt especially being that was almost 100 degrees out!! I will gladly continue to come to this location!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia
Dan W.,"Anaheim, CA",145,499,507,5.0,1/16/2017,I was up in Visalia to meet with my daughter. We decided to meet at Red Robin. We asked for a booth and sat down at a nice clean table. After a few minutes our server came by and took our drink orders and showed us how to order right from the table. We ordered our lunch and after a short wait we had our food.  The food here is great and the fry's are really good to!! Our burgers were made just as we had asked. The server took our order and the food was just right!!   This has to be one of the best burgers out there!!! You get quality and freshness here for sure!!! Even the little extras like additional BBQ sauce was delivered with a smile...  This place has the best staff and customer service by far.

Unfortunately,  I couldn't give a higher rating, due to their selection of beers (for happy hour pricing). Out of the 10 beers on tap, only 2 were on happy hour pricing, which was a huge disappointment. As for appetizers on happy hour, the selection was minimal as well, only 3 options.

Frank G.,"Visalia, CA",9,69,48,4.0,3/25/2017,"Victor if you ever read this. Thank you for your service here on our multiple trips here. You certainly go through a lot with shitty inconsiderate customers and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Working in customer service I feel for you brother! Will keep tipping big for you!  Now on to the review. The four is because the wife and I haven't given up on R.R. Yet. When you choose the right thing you have the most amazing meal! Who would've known you can get so much joy for your tummy when eating a burger lol. But when you don't choose the right thing your stuck being unfulfilled and your tummy hates you cause you're still hungry! I love that they do bottomless fries and beverages ""certain beverages mainly your main sodas plus now root beer floats"", yum! Oh also Lemonade. I had the Southern Charm burger last time we came here a few days ago. It was good but wasn't great. Spent 14 dollars on the burger and I could've gotten a better one for a few dollars less; bigger too. But overall it was good, would definitely would try something else instead of this one. You can get a better one of these at Carl's JR lol it's the same burger just bigger and on a different bun. Customer Service Advice- don't be an ass to your server. Unless they're rude or deserve it, don't do it! If you just placed your order then turn around and ask him five minutes later ""where's my burger at? Everyone else is getting theirs!?"" First off.. this was an old lady doing this so ""I get it"" but still it was not cool and very disrespectful to the server. She didn't know we were waiting for 10 minutes before they even showed up to get our food and the other couples that came before her as well. Victor held is own and stayed cool about it. The 2nd incident- the couple behind us barely sits down and right after dealing with The bitty our server asks them ""hi folks what can I get you started with today?"" The guys first response is ""we'd like to get some drinks first!"" In the most condescending asshole voice ever! Again without missing a beat Victor overcame and took their drink order. This was a poor excuse from people in general. Learn to be a little nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=20

The floor is covered in smashed fried zucchini and crayons. The bench has crumbs all over it....and the food - I could have gotten a better meal at Carl's Junior and paid less.

Victoria O.,"New York, NY",684,721,322,4.0,10/9/2013,"First time at a Red Robin as the SB location se fue ages ago and my FB friends were right: it's a very good burger! I loved my cole slaw, so much so I am thinking we should hit RR and bring home a pint or something for me to eat on the way home.  I read the other reviews so was prepared for terrible service but our server was outstanding. Not good but great. When we walked in, it wasn't that crowded but the host told us we might want to sit in the bar because there were a ton of kids in the main dining area.  An excellent--and insightful--suggestion as I had a horrible hormone headache and I like other people's kids in public places but in moderate quantities. I have no desire for a Chuck E Cheese experience, at least if it is half as bad as my parent friends who pretty much associate with all that is evil about public places or children.  Our server doubles as bartender and still, he was efficient and friendly running his a** between the two jobs. He struck me as smarter than the average kid in college working at a casual eatery to make some extra money and I would not be surprised if he intends to get out of Visalia ASAP and go to a metropolitan area to do something interesting and fun with his life.  (We went to Foster's Freeze after dinner and while the sundae was perfect--just what I wanted--my stomach turned both at the smell and the sadness both of employees and customers. Those kids broke my heart, seeming destined for very little else by Foster's Freeze on Mooney Blvd. The sad vibe and smell made my boyfriend and me eat on the little stone edge outside before hopping back in the car to the Marriott.)  J ordered a bacon burger and the steak fries with the Thai dipping sauce. I thought the sauce was weird but he enjoyed it. My cheeseburger was great and as I was sick, I didn't drink alcohol so the tab for two including tip was only 26. Pretty great for the quality of the food.  (They do have a wide range of specialty cocktails in the 8 dollar range: big fruity tropical things. They also have ""beer shakes""--a combination of beer, whiskey and ice cream. Too weird for me but I thought I'd mention it)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=60

Robert S.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/24/2015,Horrible horrible.  We showed up around 9pm and the place was almost empty.  No one was dining there yet we still waited around a while to be greeted.  Once greeted we were told there was a wait because there went enough waiters to help us.  Couldn't you sit us down and hand us menus so we could at least start relaxing?  We saw A LOT of empty tables.  We decided to leave and head to another restaurant.  Will definitely not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=80

Herm T.,"Visalia, CA",35,72,243,3.0,7/12/2014,"It's been a couple of years since I've tried it.  Never a fan but came because of a large gathering.  The menu has narrowed to essentially expendive burgers and a smattering of sandwiches.  I ordered the cod fish n chips.  The batter is tender crunchy light in taste.  The fish is fluffy and quite flaky juicy.  Hoeever the fish sauce is bland with nary any tangy flavor that I normally expect.  The fries is quite robust and thick cut.  Sadly any kind of vegetable side fixing is missing.  For $ 12, a side of cole slaw would be nice. A four star for dish but two stars for a very pricy sandwich menu. Overall, it's a three.  It's not my kind of restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=80

I noticed we weren't the only table she was neglecting. Unfortunately I have eaten here before plenty of times and had much better service.

A C.,"Pixley, CA",2,13,14,1.0,1/4/2015,"Let me start with saying I had high hopes for the place the moment I walked in. Then it all went downhill from there. We waited roughly 5 minutes at 10PM when there were only 4-5 other customers here, unacceptable especially given the fact that there were 3 employees just sitting down playing with their phones. We finally get seated my girlfriend orders a water as do I and thats when the claws come out, the waitress gives us a look and says ""thats all you want to drink?"" I simply ignore it assuming thats just how she is. So the reason we stopped by here is for a free birthday burger for I and the girlfriend ordered her own burger. I order the burger and the waitress comes back moments later saying I cant have that burger since its considered a ""fine"" burger. No where on the RR App does it mention of any restrictions. I speak to the manager who also has no power to do anything about it so I order a regular burger one ""approved"" for the free birthday burger meal. Same thing, now the computer wont allow it to be inputed. We finally get the burgers and I dont want to even eat it till I clarify if it will be free or not. The manager comes over says she was able to fix it somewhat I just simply thank her for her ""help"" and proceed to eating the burger which wasn't the best I ever had. The fries were cold at first but after we gave a few more complaints they came out piping hot. Overall I would say the service here definitely needs working on. The manager needs to retrain many of her employees who are immature and severely lack customer service skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=100

Raul S.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/11/2014,The worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant!!  No exaggeration. We waited for 20 minutes for water because our server was never assigned. The food took over 30 minutes tocarrive and the messed up orders and forgot to fullfill one of my friend's orders.  It would take forever for our server to come back after we would request something. No refills or second order of fries.  Ordering milkshakes was probably the hardest  task ever at a restaurant. The staff messed up the order by bring wrong milkshakes. Then second time they brought one less than we ordered. The third time they brought the wrong type of milkshake so we finally gave up.  Lastly they messed up our bills. After 2 plus hours we had finsihed eating lunch.  The staff needs severe help in service!

Our waitress notified us that our meals were behind because they had to ""remake"" my chicken wings...ok I thought...we waited some more..sipped on our drinks...Out came our food..from the manager himself.. My remade chicken was COMPLETELY COLD! From The chips they laid on to the actual inside of the little chicken nuggets themselves! My friends burgers..cold as well..the cheese was hard and the bacon was crumbled and old. After complaining, they remade burgers, I no longer had the time or wanted to wait for My buffalo nuggets. :( bummer..I looked forward to that all day at work to be disappointed. Our waitress...sweet girl..she gave me some french fries to snack on. Yummy. The manager ended up giving food for free... Thanks. Will I go here again?

It has walnuts, apples, Dijon flavored mustard, and mixed greens. He really loved it, and he's not too fond of salads. I ordered the margarita, which was only five bucks and it was perfectly made. The server, Mark, was attentive and really nice. He was waiting on quite a few tables and yet was able to check in with us frequently to make sure we had what we needed. If I was his boss I would definitely give him a raise. I highly recommend this location and will definitely be coming back.

After being seated, my mom and I were promptly served our drinks, which I always appreciate. They took our order right away and then the staff basically disappeared. AN HOUR LATER (yes, an hour), we finally got our food...and my order was wrong. I ordered sweet potato fries and they brought regular steak fries. So I ate those and started to eat my burger while waiting for them to bring the right fries. The burger was not at all warm and had very little flavor. And considering that it was the Burnin' Love burger, that's kind of insane. How can there be no flavor in a burger with pepper jack cheese, fried jalapeños, chipotle aioli, and salsa?? I've had it numerous times before at other Red Robin locations and it was fantastic. My mom's salad sucked. The chicken was dry, there were a measly TWO fried jalapeño coins, and there was about one teaspoon of dressing in one small spot of the plate. We never received an apology or an explanation for the terribly slow service. The place wasn't even busy. It was like 30% full. We were charged full price for everything, even after the ridiculous wait and the crappy food.

There's plenty of parking. It was pretty cracking for a Monday afternoon. We were seated right away in a booth. Drink orders were taken and they all were delivered at separate times, which I found weird. I got the freckled lemonade, as usual. My favorite part is the strawberries at the bottom. The first drink had an average amount and then they started to skimp on the refill. Grrr. I did like how our waitress didn't need to really ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks, she just brought them for us. Other than that service was a bit on the slow side. But I attribute that to it being so busy. It took awhile for our orders to be taken and then for our food to arrive and the check to be delivered. I got the prime chophouse burger, which is a special they're running right now. It had mushrooms, cheese and those stringy onion rings. So yummy. And of course it came with their bottomless fries. Sprinkle some of their special seasoning on those giant steak fries and it's on. :-) My friends had the turkey burger and veggie burger.
