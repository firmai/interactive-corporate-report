117,E W.,"Fairfax, VA",5,24,,4.0,2012-02-14,I so love Red Robin! I've never had a bad experience there and everything I've ordered has been yummy.  They're good at refilling drinks quickly  - and don't judge me because I can down a gallon of Iced Tea :) The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they always have balloons around and I don't like balloons.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.48,3.2800000000000002
120,Jessica C.,"Dayton, OH",9,111,3.0,3.0,2012-03-06,"This Red Robin was just OK. I'm used to RR being a place for delicious burgers with quick and friendly service. The food was great here but the service was a little bit ""meh"". I also didn't remember any other RR being as jam-packed with kids as this location. Don't get me wrong, I know its a family restaurant but there were children literally everywhere. I guess we can chalk that up to being in Fairfax. We arrived to what we were told was a 5-10 minute wait, they host and manager then proceeded to seat every single customer before us and several parties that arrived well after us. After about 15-20 minutes, my husband asked about our table and we were the next group seated. We ordered drinks and waited quite some time for them. Finally we ordered our food: I got a Whiskey River Chicken sandwich and subbed the tomato for avocado--they did this for free which was really great! My husband ordered the Bonzai burger. I also asked for a cup of soup to be served before our meal and my husband asked for his fries first because we were STARVING. Unfortunately we didn't get the soup or fries first and our orders came out about 25 minutes later. The soup was taken off our bill with no problems. The restaurant was very busy and I definitely saw our waiter running around a lot so I certainly can't say anything bad about him being ""lazy"" or ""slow"". A little more organization would have meant a higher bill and thus, a larger tip for our waiter but he was a nice guy and I didn't really mind not having my soup. Overall-- it wasn't a bad experience but it's definitely not our favorite Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.38,3.3200000000000003

146,Anna L.,"South Riding, VA",253,634,122.0,1.0,2012-05-04,"I normally enjoy the burgers at Red Robin, but this was an exception.  I went for lunch and sat in the bar.  They were not at all busy when I arrived at 11:30.  The visit started out badly and went downhill from there.  On my last visit, the server had given me a Royal Rewards card and told me not to activate until I knew I would be back within 2 weeks as I would receive a free appetizer on my next visit.  I activated and visited today, but was refused the free appetizer.  My server told me the promotion had ended, but he would check with his manager to see if they could still honor the request.  Needless to say, the server never checked with the manager or followed up with me.  Next my lunch date ordered his burger - some sort of double patty burger with bacon.  The menu stated it came with American cheese, which he does not enjoy.  He asked for cheddar instead and the server refused because it would change the ""flavor profile"" of the burger!  Seriously!  Last time I checked, customers pay for food in restaurants and it should please the customer's palate, not fit the ""flavor profile"".   Then the last straw, the food itself.  The burgers were flavorless. I found that surprising with all the toppings on my Guacamole burger which is usually quite tasty.  My date's burgers were charred black and tiny - something akin to a fast food burger and certainly not up too what I would expect from a so-called gourmet burger chain!  I will NOT visit this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.052,3.2000000000000006
111,Emily A.,"Fairfax, VA",125,211,176.0,3.0,2012-05-07,"Red Robin is certainly not my favorite food spot in the area, but their food is usually pretty consistent and they have a nice selection of menu items. You can eat pretty healthy on their menu or you can indulge in a greasy burger and bottomless fries.  Let's talk about the food: For the appetizers, I really like their mozzarella sticks and the onion ring tower. One of my favorite salads is the Apple Harvest Chicken Salad. The Whiskey River BBQ chicken sandwich and the Bruschetta chicken sandwiches are both delicious. I am not a big fan of the Teriyaki chicken sandwich because I actually got food poisoning from the chicken the first time I had Red Robin (over 10 years ago in Ohio). I just can't bring myself back to ordering it, but I'm sure it's fine if cooked properly.  Many of the specialty drinks are a bit too sweet for my liking, but I do enjoy the freckled lemonade if it's watered down a bit.  One thing I particularly do not like about this location is the screaming children. There are always birthday parties or large families with screaming kids. I usually try to be seated in the bar area to avoid this, but sometimes they are still seated there. As a result of all the kids, sometimes the place looks a little sloppy, with food and other junk on the floor. I will only agree to heading to Red Robin when I am in a mood to handle the loud atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.348,3.2400000000000007

Prompt service, too, and iced tea refills. The burgers have been consistently good. On this visit, I enjoyed a Peach Iced Tea while waiting for a Bacon Cheeseburger. I like Red Robin's regualr burgers. Not too large, just right for lunch and cooked Medium as I like it. (I would like to see more regular burger varieties, but without the onion straws on top that seem to accompany the more exotic creations.) I've never tested the ""bottomless"" French fires. That woud be too much! But, I often will have a second helping. (Portions of the French fries seem designed with that in mind.) Sometimes the server will just bring a seocnd helping, sometiems ask if one is wanted, and sometimes you must ask.

I like the Whiskey River and Peppercorn burgers. I especially like their bottomless french fries that come with the burgers - want some more fries - just ask. Occasionally we've had their onion ring appetizers, milk shakes, and mudd pie. The onion rings are full rings with a thick batter. They are good but were too much for two people. They are pretty flexible about substitutions - veggie burgers for real burgers and salad for french fries. Although we usually have (bottomless soft drinks) they do have a bar for an occasional beer. The last time we were there they had made some menu changes that we liked. Smaller versions of the selected burgers were available and smaller versions of the appetizers were available. These changes provide additional incentive to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.416,3.1200000000000006
140,Erin A.,"Leesburg, VA",0,34,,1.0,2012-11-09,"I've been to this Red Robin several times and am always disappointed. The servers always seem to hate their jobs and the management isn't any better. The last time I was there was in May 2012 for my mother's birthday. She is on oxygen so you think they would put us close to the door so she doesn't have to walk across the restaurant, but no, they didn't. We had to walk across the restaurant, when clearly there was service closer to the door because other people were sitting there. The service was the worst I've ever had, to the point where I didn't even want to tip (I'm a 20-25% tipper no matter where I go). I complained to their corporate office, who then sent me an automatic e-mail saying someone from that restaurant would get back to me within 48 hours. Did that happen? Absolutely not. It took over a week to get back to me at which point the manager said, ""We've been busy"".  Unreal. He then said that he hopes we would give them another chance and he would be sending us something in the mail. I don't know why I actually thought something would be coming, but I did, and surprise, nothing ever came. Terrible, terrible customer service. I will never go back.

The sauce and the burgers are very well done. I'm just a little confused, Red Robin started as a Bar in Washington near the University of Washington, and sold spirits.  Burgers came around in the 80s and proceeded to grow.  Weird at how the companies values and roots started as a drinking establishment and it's now a ""family friendly"" environment....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.448,3.0400000000000005

The lacking in the quality of burger may be enhanced if you were to order any number of their specialty burgers, particularly if they loaded it up with lots of moist and flavorful toppings.  I'm a purist when it comes to burgers, though, and that burger better stand up on its own, in my humble opinion!!

Who knows?! Anyways! The burgers here are good and come out fairly quickly.  I use to always order the Blackened Chicken Burger, which has a peppery seasoning on the chicken and smothered in a spicy chipotle mayo mix, which was heavenly and the perfect amount of heat to a burger.  Sadly, it is no longer on the menu so now my go-to favorite is the Royal burger.  Anything topped with a fried egg is sure going to be tasty and delicious (And a heart attack).  The bottomless fries are just an added bonus (More bang for your buck!)  I love the thick cut fries, not some skinny fries that other places serve.  And the dipping sauces are great; I always get the Poppy Seed Honey Mustard and the Camp Fire BBQ.  I've only ordered those 2 burgers every time I visit, so my review is not as solid as others who have ordered more off the menu.  Not my favorite burger place, but good for a quick meal.  Service is a hit or miss sometimes, but it is pretty consistent with the delivery on their food and that's enough for me to return.

Keep in mind most of the staff is in the 20-something crowd and don't get overly rude with them.  I listened to a small group at a table do nothing but nit-pick about every little thing as they came in, speak down to the waitress while she was taking the order and then complain that burgers were dry, fries cold, on and on and on (seriously, it was even annoying to me).  Maybe the complaints were legit, but I had a pleasant interaction with my waitress and my food was cooked perfectly and fries pipping hot.  Just sayin....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8000000000000003,2.64

I have never had a bad experience here, but I honestly think it is all about whom your server is... and I always request the same one - Jacob Lee. Jacob is an all-star at his job. He can handle multiple tables without batting an eye or getting confused. He always has a pleasant attitude as well, even under pressure. During my last visit, he had at least 8 tables at all times and I still felt like we had his undivided attention. Like I said... he's an all-star! Whatever they're paying him at Red Robin, it probably isn't enough. During my latest visit, we ordered: raspberry tea, cherry lime flip (adult beverage), avo-cobb-o salad and an order of garlic fries. Yes, GARLIC fries... it's not on their menu, but you can ask for it and Jacob will make it happen! We also ordered the Sam Adams latest seasonal brew (pumpkin) and a garden burger with regular fries. The beverages were tasty, dropped off promptly and refilled regularly. The fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Although my salad was ""complicated"" (No blue cheese or olives and subbed shredded cheddar, with dressing on the side), everything came out exactly as I requested. The burger was also correct and tasted good (I mean, come on... it's a healthy, pre-made, veggie burger... how GREAT can it be?). But with the right toppings and Dijon sauce, Red Robin does pretty darn well with it. Throughout our dining experience Jacob came by to check on us regularly and join us in friendly conversation. Seriously, you just can't beat good service AND good food! There are just a few things to note... -When we were taken to our table by the hostess, I went to climb into the booth and the bottom portion slid out. Our hostess' response was ""Oh, did it come out again? Oh, ok. Let me fix that for you"" and pushed it back in. I appreciated the gesture, but the reaction was as if it was a normal, natural reaction and happens all the time. Um... time for a replacement RR!  -Lastly, and of no consequence to RR, this place is very kid-friendly. It is not uncommon for the little people to be running around or loudly talking/screaming.

Ordered a Raspberry Iced Tea and the server brought one over with another one closely followed behind.  He said he thought the first one didn't have enough raspberry syrup in it so he brought another one just in case.  Huh, a little strange since I hadn't even tasted the first one!  But okay, he was kind of right...the second one DID taste better.  I guess he knew his raspberry syrup limitations. All in all, we had a pretty good time at Red Robin.  The burger was decent, the fries are delicious (even though that ""bottomless"" cup they put it in fools me every time...it's truly ""bottomless"" and if you try to pick it up all the fries fall out), and the service was good.  A-OK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.636,2.6
87,Craig H.,"Fairfax, VA",22,18,11.0,4.0,2014-01-05,"We decided earlier in the day to go out for a nice Sunday family dinner, which is code for ""my wife didn't want to cook tonight"". The wife and I have both been craving burgers and Red Robin has been one of the few local burger joints we have not tried, so...off we went. First, we were greeted by the hostess (Taylor was her name) who had such charm, politeness, and a smile that just made your heart glow...like in E.T. She was so enrapturing she could of seated us outside at the back dumpster and I would have been happy. After she expertly grabbed our silverware (I'm pretty sure it wasn't REAL silver) she lead us to our table, expertly navigating through the other customers and Red Robin-ites, and  made sure we were happy with the seating arrangements, bode us a farewell with another E.T. heartglow smile and dashed back to dutifully attend to the customers who were piling in behind us for the dinner rush. Our culinary service specialist (Audrey) came to our table and immediately and cheerfully set about getting us set up with drinks (CHERRY COKES!!!...I had about eight...teen of them...which is why I am wired to the hilt right now...SUGAR AND CAFFEINE!!!) and pleasantly took our appetizer order, which was a tower of onion rings. We opted for the larger stack being that we haven't eaten much all day, which is code for ""we just want to jam golden fried oniony deliciousness down our necks"".  The culinary service specialist zipped off and placed our order and returned after a few moments of critical decision making on which burgers we would be partaking. While we were sitting a polite gentlemen employee (Jay/James?) brought a plate of fresh steak fries for the kids to help keep them occupied and less boisterous. Thanks Jay/James! OF NOTE: While I was looking at the menu, I noticed that one of the decorations in the restaurant was a carousel zebra perched overlooking our table...it was staring at me...it was  . It was looking at me with its large black eyeballs as if to say, ""I'm a carousel zebra and this is all your fault...I'm made of wood and have a pole jammed through my midsection. Enjoy your meal!"". At one point I swear it made an angry accusatory whinnying noise at me. We ordered our burgers (sirloin burger for the wife and a BBQ bacon burger for me), our 3 year old daughter got the corn dog from the kids menu with strawberries...who the hell orders a corn dog and STRAWBERRIES??? At this point an older couple and their grandson are seated in a booth adjacent to us...the kid has a robot tyrannosaurus rex. Yes, a robot T-Rex is now sitting right by me and now all I can think of is how I want a robot T-Rex too. This thing was awesome..it was remote controlled and had little tiny robot T-Rex arms and a GIANT fierce robot T-Rex head. I hope it doesn't have to reach for anything on the table with those tiny robot T-Rex arms. Awkward. The food arrives and everything is just as we ordered it, even the mayo I asked to be kept off my burger was kept off my burger. There is a special place in HELL for people that put mayo on their burgers. The burgers are cooked right and the fries are crispy...not that it matters because I just jammed half a tower of fried onion rings into my belly about 10 minutes ago. I look down at my chest and see my heartlight glowing again...but that's only because the hostess Taylor was walking by again with another set of customers. The meal was delicious and well prepared.  Dessert? Of course, because eating a 2 foot stack of onion rings, 3 plates of fries, a BBQ bacon cheeseburger, and drinking eight...teen Cherry Cokes isn't enough for us tonight! We order the Mud Pie. It was great. It was large. It was chocolate ice cream. It had whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate frosting. This is where I hit the wall. Not even the heartlight of the delightful hostess, or the angry accusatory empty black eyeballed stare of the carousel zebra, or the supreme polite culinary service specialist Audrey, or even the robot T-Rex that is tauntng me one booth over can detract from the fact that I am the biggest glutton in Fairfax tonight. I feel...shame...and a lot of pressure in my lower abdomen. We had a wonderful family meal, with great service, in a very enjoyable, clean, and presentable environment. 4/5 stars! Serious rant: I am knocking off one star due to the fact that the burger patties are mass produced frozen pre-packaged patties that have no distinct flair or flavor about them. I think that if you are going to tout ""gourmet"" burgers on your menu, you should be making your own burger meat with some sort of seasonings or unique flair. I have seen an overwhelming majority of restaurants use these pre-fabricated patties and it really does take away from eating a proper old fashioned burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.7359999999999998,2.6
45,Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",902,1369,1441.0,2.0,2014-01-25,Red Robin is mostly about the burgers when we come down to it. My husband and I stopped here on a Sunday on the spur of the moment after agreeing we were both hungry and we didn't know what we wanted to eat. I ordered the crispy Altantic cod sandwich and subbed the fries for a side salad. The sandwich was soaked in mayo and grease.This is not my first time getting this so I know it can be done better. My husband got the Royal Red Robin and loved it. He said the grill cooked made it just right. As soon as he bit into it the egg saturated the burger and bun making it a delicious taste bud experience. It made me very evidence as my crispy cod was no where near the experience.  One thing I thought was odd about our experience was being sat in the bar area. We were a couple that was planning to actually have a conversation instead of watching the Sunday night game. It was annoying because I kept hearing sports the whole time while trying to talk to my husband. LoL Myabe my hubby planned it this way? I guess I will never know.  Service was slow and was lacking for being a slow night at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.568,2.56

The hostess seemed like she was on drugs, vaguely staring at us, and then wandering really slowly to bring us to our table. Even though there were plenty of open tables elsewhere and it was after the lunch rush, we were seated in the back right next to the kitchen door. Not a great seat. She didn't bother to say two words to us after seating us. Just walked off somewhere with a really blank look on her face. We proceeded to sit there for 10 minutes waiting for anybody to show up and say anything to us. Plenty of waiters walked by during this time, and we saw a manager walking around as well. Then we got up and walked out. Nobody noticed, and the hostess wasn't anywhere to be seen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.436,2.44

I come here when I want one of those types of burgers. This location is a favorite, preferred over the Chantilly location for service and food. It's kept clean from the dining area to the bathrooms. The service is always great, friendly people which is how it should be, but it seems like they definitely are trained to have excellent customer service here.  I came yesterday (4/5/14) for the first time in a couple months and they have changes their menu. It's now in a notebook style unlike the gigantic one page menu. I like this better because it's easier to look at. The chili cheese fries had a good amount of chili and bacon on top with their thick cut steal fries. The Bruschetta Chicken sandwich with pesto aioli, provolone and balsamic cream was crazy good. I usually get a burger but I wanted to try their chicken and I am surprised at how good it was. For a burger my favorite is the A1 peppercorn which has onion strings, peppercorn spread, bacon and pepperjack cheese with an onion bun. Don't even think about the calories on this one because you'd probably need to start doing cardio immediately. Chili con queso and onion tower are my favorite appetizers. As for the fries, you can't go wrong with bottomless fries especially when you asked for the garlic parmesean fries! They are free and are bottomless also!  The most important thing is to get the Red Robin loyalty card. You get rewarded and points for eating here. When you get 9 burgers, the 10th one is free. But they have $5 off, free milkshake, free birthday burger and other cool rewards, so definitely sign up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.768,2.56

Finally he comes to the table, and we had decided to switch to a table across from us, because it was a little cleaner.  He comes over and we asked for menus, and 2 glasses of tea, another 20 minutes go by and still no menu or drinks.  I asked my husband if he was ready to leave, and low and behold the server shows up with the drinks, but no menu.  He asks if we are ready to order.  I laughed and said, ""I would love to, but you have never brought the menus"".....""Oh,"" he says...finally the menus show up, and we ordered Burgers with their fries.  We asked him to bring us a plate of fries as they are refillable, and when they get to the table....wait for it...they are cold.  Then the burgers get there, and he has given me the wrong bun.  LOL...I was afraid to say anything for fear the food would be taken and I would never see it again.  So, finally we ask for our check.  He comes to the table, and we give him  our loyalty card, he comes back, hands us the bill, we give him our credit card...oh, the bill did not come attached to the folio, so, he puts the credit card in his back pocket and goes over to another table to get their order.  I got up and went to the manager.....The whole experience was less then stellar and I do not think I want to go back to the Fairlakes store for awhile.  The experience was not all that, for sure...!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=120,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.504,2.52

While I applaud them for their industry in trying to stay open during renovation, I eat out very seldom and when I do I want the ambience as well as a decent meal.  My food was fine, though I didn't get what I ordered, but my friend found the grilled chicken in her salad to taste boiled and reheated on a grill and didn't eat her meal.  We also waited quite awhile to get our food.  That may be due to the renovation limitations.  Hope the new and improved is worth coming back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.372,2.36

Our waitress, Christy, was awesome and kept our drinks full and kept telling us she was sorry for the long wait on the food.  As mentioned earlier, once we got our food it was first rate, but the wait was a lot longer than we have experienced in the past.  Bottom line, our experience would have been better if the manager/shift leader would have had cleanliness at the top of the list before opening the doors for business today and had kept on top of the cook staff to get food out of the kitchen faster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.604,2.44

75,Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,899.0,3.0,2014-12-09,"How I heard of this place: My first taste of Red Robin was when it opened in Bellingham, Washington while I was in junior high school. This particular one was introduced to me by my husband, Chris, when he had a burger craving on our day out running errands. Type of cuisine: Burgers and fries to start...Now patrons can also enjoy wraps, salads, sandwiches, mac'n cheese, prime rib dips, nachos and even pasta! Ambiance: Bright, cluttered and full of random artwork, from photographs of James Dean to cats, the Red Robin mascot, to Nagel prints. Booths and table-chair seating are available for diners wishing to enjoy their meals. The space is loud with music, children and the bustling of the diners. Serving staff is friendly, bubbly and very customer-service friendly.   What I ordered: To start, our long-awaited monster-sized Mint Brownie Shake ($4.49), of cool mint syrup and chewy Nestlé® Toll House® brownie pieces, topped off with whipped cream and more Nestlé® Toll House® brownie pieces. Knowing how I always get my free refill on bottomless fries, we requested ours before the burgers arrived in order that we could begin munching and not have to order an appetizer. For our main entrees, I selected the California Chicken Sandwich ($9.79), a tender, juicy grilled chicken breast topped with Provolone cheese, zesty guacamole, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles & mayo. A side of ranch dressing for my fries, and I was all set. Chris chose the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($9.99), a tender, juicy grilled chicken breast basted with Red Robin's signature Whiskey River® BBQ Sauce and topped with melted Cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. A side of honey mustard dressing, and Chris was also ready to dig in! On a return visit, Sunday, February 19, 2012: Chris and I returned to this location on our way home from his birthday weekend in Lexington, Virginia, to partake of his free birthday burger. On this burger evening, Chris enjoyed the Prime Chophouse Burger ($9.69), ""distinguished and delicious, this juicy burger is layered with horseradish-sautéed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, Provolone cheese and piled high with crispy onion straws. Served on an onion bun with creamy Country Dijon Sauce."" For me, it was a tough call between burgers, the croissant BLT and the Whiskey River BBQ Wrap. Then, when I narrowed it down to having something hot, my staple Honey Mustard Chicken Burger seemed too been there done that, and I went with the Burnin' Love Burger ($9.59), ""You'll get fired up for the crisply fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa and spicy Pepper-Jack cheese layered on top of our cayenne-seasoned burger. It's topped with lettuce and fresh tomatoes to cool things off and served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo."" With a side of lemonade (that, I just noticed, was free!) for Chris and two additional baskets of bottomless fries with ranch dressing, our bellies were full and our faces happy! What I loved: I love the endless fries! Between the two burgers, the Whiskey River had more flavor and zip. The freshness of the California was noticeable in the vegetables and guacamole, but after having tried the BBQ sandwich, first, it left something to be desired. Why I loved it: Quick, simple, consistent and free for your birthday! I guess we will be back next month to celebrate! Cost: Average ($8-$10 per burger with bottomless fries)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.38,2.76

However the first time when I ordered my burger medium-well it came out looking more like medium rare.  The burger and fries were EXTREMELY salty--and I love salt---but this was an excessive amount of salt!!! Their ""bottomless fries"" pitch annoyed me---because they advertise ""bottomless fries"" which seems like a good thing at first to those who love french fries--but they bring out a plate with a very small amount of french fries that are placed in a little circular metal thing that looks like a napkin ring. When you go to lift the napkin ring off your 5 or 6 french fries ""wahlahhh! Bottomless fries! Get it?! The fries fall through the napkin ring and therefore there is no BOTTOM to them = BOTTOMLESS FRIES!!!"" I wanted to punch the jerk who came up with that smartass idea.  The second time I went I ordered my burger well-done but the burger was so greasy that the grease saturated the bun and I could barely eat it because I was so busy trying to peel off the greasy spots that my burger fell apart. I asked for a basket of fries as to avoid having to ask for more fries because their bottomless fry advertisement is a sham, as I mentioned above and what did I get? The same small amount of fries in a basket thats very shallow to give the appearance that you're getting a lot more than you are! Wow. Both visits the fries were overcooked. I asked for fresh fries and by the time they brought them out I was ready to leave.   I put them and the rest of my burger in a to-go box that made my entire car smell like a noxious fart within 10 minutes.

On numerous occasions we have had to wait more than 5-10 minutes to get our drinks and over 35 minutes to get our food (not ordering an appetizer). This last attempt has put us over the boiling point to considering returning to this location. We decided to sit at the bar as usual, since the service was generally OK in the past. We were greeted by Matt who has been part of the terrible service in the last 6 months. We put in an order for onion rings, a wrap, and a burger, no substitutions or special orders required. We were promptly given our drinks in 5 minutes and the onion rings came out within another 5. There couldn't have been more than 30% of the restaurant filled at this point so we thought the rest of the food would have come out within 15 mins of the appetizers. Boy were we wrong. Approximately 4 tables became full at the bar while we were eating our onion rings. This was at least 15 minutes after we had sat down and ordered. 20 minutes passes by and no food. 30 minutes pass by, still no food. No word from Matt explaining why everything is taking so long. Another group of 4 sit down in the bar area. Now two of the groups who sat down after us get their food...WTF. I keep seeing the manager peering out of the kitchen looking up at the bar. Another 10 minutes pass by, still no food and ANOTHER group who sat down at least 20 minutes after us has their food. OK seriously, 10 more minutes we are about to throw down $5 for our drinks. Matt comes by and says our food will be right out. 10 more minutes pass by. Don't tell us our food will be right out and 10 minutes later it's still not there. By now every group except for one has received their food before us. Finally our food comes out. No more than 2 minutes later does Matt drop off our check. What if we wanted another drink, what if we wanted dessert....are we not allowed? No one asks us how our meal is going, if we need anything else, or if we need anything else to drink. The other bar tender takes our check and luckily we could get out of there in 5 minutes. Never have I been so disappointed in a meal at this Red Robin in 20 years.

She brought me Sprite instead of club soda, then started arguing with me though the drink was clearly sweet. ""Well, I must have accidentally put some Sprite in there.""

They renovated this location recently, so it's got a new section with nice windows, a patio, and a chalkboard wall to entertain the kiddos while you're waiting for a table. Some of my favorites on the menu include the Royal Red Robin (cheeseburger with an egg), the Banzai (teriyaki and grilled pineapple), and the guacamole bacon burger (self-explanatory). I also really enjoy their prime dip sammy. My one tip is to skip the apps -- especially the o-rings, as tempting as even the ""o-ring shorty"" might be, because with bottomless fries you'll have more than your fair share of goodies to snack on.

We had no napkins or silverware during our meal; we had to ask for napkins at the very end. I informed our server that I had a reward I wanted to use. He said ok and said he could take my card(since I had it ready) and process it to save us time. He then proceeded to disappear for 15-20 minutes. When we finally got the check, the card had not been run, and the reward had not been applied. I informed him of the reward, and reminded him I had given my card. He had to dig around to find my card, then went to run it again. About 5 minutes later, a woman brought the check and my card back over, but it was missing the slip for me to sign. We waited a few moments, and my husband went to track down any server he could find to ask him for our slip. That server told him that was the amount we owed, which is when my husband let him know we had already paid. They then found our slip, which we tipped and signed.

Although each server hasn't gone above and beyond to help themselves individually, I blame 100% of my poor experience on the manager. I think the perfect punishment would be for him/her to dine at this restaurant for themselves and find out what the experience is like from our perspective.  It has been common place for our wait once seated to be 10 plus minutes before a server comes to us. Each experience has had various errors in the order such as wrong and I'll-prepared food. I am currently dining at the restaurant right now and I haven't seen a manager since I arrived 40 minutes ago. Our waiter this experience is Alex he has done an above average job considering his manager isn't putting him in a winning position.  Wait, I just saw the manager. She was addressing the other angry patrons by telling them it is not her fault, but the fault of the brand new waitress.

The servers are amazing and the food is always great. Today however I experienced something I didn't think I would. The hostess was by far one of the rudest individuals I have ever met. She looked incredibly unkept and acted as if certain patrons were a burden to her. As we stood in front of the hostess stand, waiting for her to return, she looked at us as if we were bothering her. She then said ""what's up?"" with the nastiest attitude as if we were crazy to ask her to . We then asked to be seated and she proceeded to roll her eyes. This infuriated my fiancé but I unknowingly gave her the benefit of the doubt.  While we were eating our dinner, my fiancé noticed the hostess constantly rolling her eyes at everyone who entered the restaurant asking to be seated. We saw her on her phone and ignoring individuals until one of her coworkers would walk by and at that point she was the most dutiful hostess. It did however strike me as odd that when an individual who appeared to be Caucasian entered the restaurant, they were greeted with the utmost respect while those of ""darker hues"" were treated with disrespect. After noticing all of this, against my fiancés guidance I took it upon myself to wish this hostess a great evening. Only to see her roll her eyes at me in disgust.

This location features the self order terminals and of course my son who is three years old loves to touch everything with a flat screen; so please watch out you don't have any additional charges with the many games loaded on the system. Great distraction, but I personally don't care for them. I understand we are moving towards advancing our society with technology and hiring less people to make a profit. In doing so I felt the service was not accommodating for our Thursday night visit.  Sole reason why I visit is the Fries. I love their thick cut Fries; reminds me of English fish and chips Fries. Today, our fries where served room temperature and in my opinion stale from sitting under the heating lamp. With three attempts and specifically mentioning our distaste to our server, I felt it wasn't going to get better. Service was sluggish even with a handful of costumers in the dining room.

We had a great waitress. She was on the ball. Checked in us every 12 mins or so. Our orders came out in a flash.  Kid choices are rather epic & also super affordable & not obscenely unhealthy. I got my kids to eat broccoli! Wasn't even doused in butter, cheese ir salted. It was just blanched perfectly & totally delicious.  The only bummer was that my burger kinda sucked. It had some terrible sweet relish smothered all over it & I just didn't dig it. The sweet potato fries though - oh my oh me. I wanted to politely ask the kind waitress for a bucket of them. But I refrained cause my arteries would not have approved.  Anyways - Here are the keys to success here:  1) don't go @ peak hours. The quality of ur experience declines greatly.  2) get those dang fries.  3) make sure u understand about the condiments on the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax,2.8,2.87,2.87,,2.8419999999999996

I'd come here after high school,  I have been coming here for almost 20 years. Now having that said, recently we have had a few problems here and there (one no drink, no fry refills for my at the time girlfriend) which was taken care of. Another time where the server didn't want to be there and another wasn't attentive.  Those things happen.  We had some servers in between that were just amazing.  Now to my problem.  My dad and I went to get food and we were craving Red Robin. We went and we were greeted prosmptly, but that is all the attention we got. The waiters never paid any attention to us. We waited half an hour. Everyone was helped but us. We left and my dad told the people up front he had never been more offended at a restaurant and asked for a manager... they turned their back to him. After I found this out, I emailed corporate. All they said was they would talk to them. I wasn't asking for free food or anything... just to talk to a representative.   I was ignored in the restaurant and in the corporate level.

3,Richard C.,"Springfield, VA",2645,533,6415.0,5.0,2017-07-26,"A rare occurrence happened to us this past Sunday, July 23, 2017. On this date in history something very rare happened. It only happens once or twice a year. In recent memory it has only occurred for us in the last year or so at Mike's American Grill in Springfield Virginia, at Nazca Mochica in Washington D.C. And Pio Pio in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan New York City. It was an official ""Ultimate Dining Experience."" Of all places it was a chain restaurant and a burger joint. Red Robin in Fair Lakes.  Everything fell into place. We had gone to an antique show and were a little hungry. My wife had talked about going to Red Robin. We hadn't been to one in well over a year. The last one being in Manassas. Since moving to Springfield we hadn't been. We looked up Red Robin and decided to try the one out in Fair Lakes.  As soon as we walked in we were nicely greeted and seated. We decided to eat in the bar area. The place was very clean. I love clean, clean is wonderful. It was right after the lunch hour so being clean at this point means something. The place is set up nicely too. There is separation from the main dining area and the bar area to minimize the noise coming from the bar. I like high chairs. Not baby high chairs of course but high tables and tall chairs, they even have tall comfortable booth type tall seat and this is where we plopped ourselves down.  Immediately we were given menus and asked if we wanted drinks. For me of course a nice tall draft Bud Light and my wife some kinda strawberry lemonade type drink with Vodka. The beer was chill at just the right temperature and my wife loved the drink enough to as the waiter to let the bartender know. He can out and thanked us and talked to us a little. I wish we had his name. My wife tried another drink and again ""perfect."" Our order was taken by the bartender, he made sure he knew what we wanted and then we enjoyed our drinks while waiting.  Our food came out pretty quickly, the food was brought out by yet another super nice and friendly employee. Everything was perfect, buns super fresh, the lettuce, tomato and mushrooms all fresh and tasty. Both out burgers were cooked just as we asked and were juicy and packed full of flavor, the fries crisp and yummy. We were constantly checked in to make sure all was well. Very nice work. The meal prices are very reasonable too!! What's better than that? The place was fun, the great moods and friendliness of the staff made us feel good and bettered our mood, the atmosphere, cleanliness and wonderful food and drinks added to the whole experience.  This was an ""Ultimate Dining Experience."" and that my Yelp friends doesn't happen a lot or enough. We hadn't been to Red Robin in a long while but, I can tell you our visits will be a lot more frequent now. I never thought a burger joint could be so good. Hats off the the great crew we had the pleasure of meeting that day. Thank you for a job well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax,3.04,2.87,2.87,,2.9380000000000006
5,Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",388,253,1769.0,3.0,2017-07-30,"Ehhh it's okay.  For me, it's just overpriced for what you get. The food is okay and it is just average. Service is pretty good. I don't have really much to say. The only major downside is all the upcharges!! I went with a friend and we got pretzel bites with cheese and they didn't give very much cheese! We asked to have more and they were going to upcharge that!? It would have been an extra 2$! That was insane!!!  I think that was the main problem with this place. I think the food is just average but they charge a lot. The soup bowl is so tiny but it's so expensive!! I don't think I'd go back, maybe for a milkshake, but that's about it.  I also hate the way to pay. It is so tacky to have it on a tablet. To split the check is somewhat cumbersome as well. I wish you could just pay normally!!  Service is just average. Both times I went, it was nothing special. All in all, not memorable and overpriced!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax,3.08,2.86,2.86,,2.9480000000000004
24,Patrick C.,"Washington, DC",0,59,,2.0,2017-08-18,"Last night, I had a decidedly average experience at Red Robin, a change from what I am used to.  First, I do not know why we had two servers, not assistants or managers, but servers, and my order was wrong.  I just ate the burger and skipped the bun and topping vegetables as the roll was supposed to be plain, but was slathered in sauce, despite me telling one of the servers that I have a dairy allergy and wanted it plain.  I never got a fry refill that was requested, one that would not have had to have been requested if I had gotten a normal amount of fries with my dinner.  It also took forever to get a refill on a kid's mac and cheese. What was really disappointing is that the child's friend with whom we were dining recently had a birthday and I mentioned to the host that fact quietly as we walked to the table.  I was hoping that some of the surprise clapping was for her, but it was for two other tables, and we never got our birthday surprise.  It was a shame, but she did not know that I had told the host that, and there was no way for me to speak to them.  If they had surprised her, they would have had a customer for life as she had never been to a Red Robin previously. The wait staff was also slow in coming, but I think they rely on the tablets to be paged, something that you will not be able to do at a table where children are playing on it.  Speaking of the tablet, why is there a $2 fee when I felt overcharged as it was for a party of three, one adult and two children, with a bill of about $50 without any alcohol.  That and the lack of customer care was disappointing, even more so because Red Robin is generally not like that.   Compared to the Dulles and Chantilly locations that I have frequented recently, this one, which is the one that used to be our preferred location, has fallen short.  I felt like I was dining at a fast food restaurant, not fast casual, and the host and wait staff let me down when I thought they'd surprise the birthday girl with a song as they did to two other tables while we were there.   I do not think I'm going to rush back to any Red Robin as a result of last night's experience, since it was decidedly average for a casual/family restaurant experience, and sub-par for a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax?start=20,3.08,2.84,2.84,,2.9360000000000004

Our server, KP, was excellent.  Our food was taking quite some time and he stopped by with fries and an apology, noting that he was working on getting it out.  We really appreciated this--I hate when it doesn't seem the server cares/communicates when things are coming late--especially when the restaurant does not appear busy. The wedgie burger (comes with guac and a lettuce bun) is amazing and definitely worth a try with grilled chicken!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfax,3.08,2.86,2.86,,2.9480000000000004

Also I don't consider it as a burger when they don't even use burger buns but some type of bread instead for the Madlove burger. Wish they had tell me beforehand. The fries they gave me were also slightly cold. My friend order the double tavern and it was really bad too. It looked like a burger at Burger King. And the picture has double patties but it only came with 1.  Wait time for the food as also extremely long.

1,Jessica E.,"Franconia, VA",125,69,411.0,3.0,2017-11-13,"For years, Jeff has said that he wanted to go to Red Robin because he had never been and I finally agreed to it! We went for dinner on a Monday and we beat the dinner rush for sure. I think we even had the waiter to ourselves for a bit! Btw, shout out to Tim for providing us with excellent customer service! I jokingly told him that he would have to impress Jeff because he had never been and he definitely delivered. He even brought us an extra sauce because he wanted us to be able to taste them all!  Anyways, we were seated at a booth in the bar section and it was nice! I enjoyed the decor a lot and there were a bunch of tv's playing football.  We ordered bottomless steak and sweet potato fries while we tried to figure out what we wanted to order - side note, don't do this, especially if you take forever to decide things because by the time our food came out, I was basically full. But the fries were AMAZING and I loved all of the different sauces. The BBQ and ranch based sauce was definitely my favorite. Tim said that that was the sauce for the onion rings but it tastes amazing with everything - he was right! I wasn't super impressed with the Thai chili sauce, which has an upcharge. I don't think it's worth it. I ordered a sangria and Jeff ordered a beer. They had a pretty decent beer selection. I really enjoyed the sangria! And it was only $5!  I ended up ordering the Citrus Harrisa Salmon Burger and Jeff got the Prime Chophouse Burger. It was disappointing to hear that they wouldn't cook burgers medium rare, but whatever. I feel like the food took a little while to come out, but when it did, it looked great! I honestly wasn't super impressed with the salmon burger and would probably not recommend it as being worth trying, but it was fine. Jeff said he enjoyed his burger and would recommend it, but probably try something new next time. Overall, we had awesome service and a good time. My one random complaint was the location. This shopping center is like a maze if you don't know where you're going and there's so many random separate parking lots for everything.

I doubt that was true since he was serving every table around us. After taking our drink order and good order, it took at least another 10 minutes to get out drinks.  Then some of our orders were missing things like lettuce, onions and mayo. The burgers were pretty bland compared to other Red Robins we've been to. We will not be returning! The manager walked around oblivious to the lack of service.

In essence, they will eat until they explode like a piñata stuffed with shit.  Red Robin will bring you all the fries you want. Our server was put through a 45 minute marathon bringing plate after plate. The kids even started running back to the kitchen looking for more when the servers didn't bring a new plate fast enough.  They ate most of the fries, but not all of them.  I looked under the table and found what they didn't eat. It looked like old play-dough.  I was truly embarrassed and ready to clean it up myself. But, the server was completely understanding about it and said he'd take care of it.  He even asked if we wanted more!
