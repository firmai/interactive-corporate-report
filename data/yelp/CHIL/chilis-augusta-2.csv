Diana L.,"North Augusta, SC",1,53,27,3.0,9/21/2017,"Went for the first time on Wednesday for lunch. One of my GF's had recommended it, stating she liked the food and had gone several times recently with her husband.  Well folks I can't really form a complete opinion on the food after only one time but I can tell you to order the house or chef salad instead of lemon dressing one. I just don't consider lettuce leaves with salad dressing and a teaspoon of cheese a SALAD. South west soup was good and chips were excellent. SERVICE what little there was needs to improve pronto. We waited for silverware we waited for refills we had to ask for the chips ( they were supposed to come with three of our orders ) we never got second offer of soup. Will I go back for a second chance ? Probably. However if it is the same I will go somewhere else, too many choices nearby to not get what I paid for. I should probably take some blame for the bad service because like an idiot I tipped 20% anyway",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Paul F.,"North Augusta, SC",33,362,84,3.0,9/17/2017,Was going swimmingly until my wife found a grill brush hair in her bean burger.  They did take the cost of the burger off the bill but it really did spoil the night.   Would I go back yes I would give them another go.  For this reason 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Eric G.,"Sumter, SC",8,15,1,2.0,3/9/2017,Bartender didn't talk much at all not friendly really the food was awful I really thought about talking to a manager but I never saw one so why waste my time if they're hiding,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Twila A.,"Atlanta, GA",7,11,4,4.0,1/13/2017,"I have not been to a Chilis in years but was very glad I decided to try out this chain resturant. I ordered the Quesadilla salad and loved it! Not the healthiest salad in the world but definitely one of the tastiest. My aunt ordered the steak and salad from the lighter entree options and was very satisfied as well. We did not order an appetizer or dessert because the selections were not conducive to our ""diets"".  The lighter options offer a variety of flavorful dishes for those trying to stick to their New Years resolutions and for those not there was something definitely on the menu to indulge. We went on a Thursday night and they were offering  $5 margaritas add fruit flavors for $.50, although we chose water the neighboring tables seem to enjoy their drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Cameron W.,"Augusta, GA",79,49,200,3.0,4/3/2016,"For some odd reason I decided to come here after church. I wanted something quick and inexpensive. I food was good however the customer service was very mediocre. Being that it's the start of masters week you would think severs would be amped up. I guess the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is very true. Just a total mediocre experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Sandra S.,"Grovetown, GA",36,69,585,4.0,6/1/2015,"I ordered a craft burger.  The guacamole burger, turned out to be an amazing choice.  This mouth watering burger was topped with fresh guacamole, melted Monterey Jack cheese, fire-roasted jalapeños, sauteed red & green bell peppers, caramelized onions & cumin-lime sour cream.  Chili's hit a home run with this juicy well portioned size of beef. I dreamed of cows jumping over the moon all night!  I can't wait to try, the next craft burger on the menu.      The waitress was also over the moon.  Unfortunately, I forgot her name, but I will remeber her in my next Chilis's review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Joel C.,"Augusta, GA",0,19,55,4.0,9/23/2016,"I've been going to Chili's for years and they've definitely got consistency going for them. It's nice to be able to go anywhere and stop in at Chili's for my favs. This location was clean and not very busy at all around noon. Our waitress, Heather, took good care of us. We had the Triple Decker (Southwest Egg rolls, big mouth bites, and cheese curds)  along with the Texas Cheese Fries. All were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Marvin D.,"Fort Gordon, Augusta, GA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2017,This restaurant has a bad roach infestation. I thought I'm the only one who experienced it but you'll see similar comments from other users in TripAdvisor.  The restaurant needs to address this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Hailey M.,"Evans, GA",55,43,8,4.0,8/19/2016,Chili's is not my favorite place to eat but my husband and kids love it. In all honesty the food is nothing special but we got exactly what we ordered. Our server was probably the best part of our visit. He was friendly and attentive. I think his name was Virgil. Our food took a little longer than normal but it was a Friday night so we weren't upset because it came out right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Ann G.,"Blythe, GA",1,267,1,4.0,6/5/2017,"Four and a half stars. Kitchen staff is weird back there, but the food comes out great anyway! The service is fabulous. This is NOT in the Augusta Mall, though it is very close by and easy to find. Do you like Chili's? This one is on par, if not better, than most of the ones I've found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Yvette L.,"San Diego, CA",52,97,41,3.0,1/27/2015,"My husband wanted to treat me to a casual dinner the night before my birthday and we chose here. We got the $20 dinner for 2 and he ordered half rack of ribs, I ordered their chicken cajun pasta, and a free skillet chocolate chip cookie for my birthday. We also had free chips and salsa, I'm not sure if they're unlimited but that's what we were offered. My husband would have liked his ribs to be in sauce instead of dry rubbed because well, it was too dry for his liking. My pasta was great, the pasta noodles could've been cooked better but overall okay. I devoured the cookie skillet! It was decadent and I'd definitely get it again. Service was great, he was a little too attentive to the point it was kind of awkward to enjoy our meal but he made sure he was on top of our needs!  Had a good experience overall but not a go-to spot for us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Ann Marie D.,"Augusta, GA",84,532,930,2.0,11/1/2014,"It's been a long time since I've eaten at a Chili's. I used to LOVE the old timer burger. Maybe I should have ordered that last night.  (According to the menu it's been updated and it looked delicious)  In my absence from dining at Chili's the menu has changed. I was overwhelmed by the choices!  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Here's the bad- the restaurant wasn't really busy, but the service was seriously lacking.  The table was right by the hostess stand and door despite there being plenty of other places- lots of foot traffic going past, plus a draft from the door.   I had the crispy chicken tacos that come with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good, the tacos were a total disappointment. The taco was cold, and basically had a chicken nugget in the middle of it. The cheese had not even melted on the taco. The chicken was a lot of breading and not much meat.  I'll go back and try the new old timer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Willie D.,"Augusta, GA",453,337,3332,4.0,6/7/2014,This one I always use when I do a to go order because they are fast and my food is still hot by the time I get back to work which is about 5 mins away depending on which way I head back but the staff is really great and you can leave here with a feeling of you really got your bang for your buck. On Tuesdays right now they are selling a Oldtimers burger and fries for $4.99 which is a 1/4 pounder burger cooked anyway you want it with thick seasoned fries and ask for swiss cheese on the burger it will blow you away!. I'm a pickle and onion junkie myself they just keep calling me so I ask for them heavy and i'm not let down on that at all.If you haven't been-GO CHECK THEM OUT !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2

Alice L.,"Aiken, SC",0,6,8,3.0,10/20/2015,"This location is comparable to other Chili's locations. Servers are friendly, food is mediocre. But I feel I must notify others about the sorry portion of chicken tenders I recently purchased at the Aiken location.  My husband likes the chicken crispers on occasion, so I ordered some food To Go. I brought home his meal, he opened the box and said ""Wait...what, that's it??"" These were the most pathetic looking crispers I've ever seen! It looked liked a kids meal. The crispers were very small, flat, partially unbreaded and just pathetic looking. Definitely not worth 10 bucks, maybe $4 on a kids menu somewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Kat A.,"Hephzibah, GA",0,21,2,1.0,3/8/2016,Had to send both our steaks back due to them both being rare.  When we got the steaks back they down sized my husband's to a 6 oz from a 10oz (his ended up the same size of mine) and it was overcooked (super dry).  Mine was still undercooked but I wasn't about to send it back again. Server forgot both added on items (extra side and drink).  But at least she was nice...  We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
K D.,"Augusta, GA",0,14,,2.0,1/7/2016,"Walked in on a Sunday afternoon around 3. There was a wait for tables, but only a couple people at the bar. So, we walked to the bar to sit down. The hostess comes running up to us and chastises us for bypassing her. She says ""so there will be 2 in your party""? To which I replied, "" we need to be seated by you to drink at the bar?"" I was embarrassed and confused.  She was out of line. Maybe this was her first time in a restaurant.  After that things were fine. The bartender was good and the food was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2

AnaMarie C.,"Seaside, CA",0,15,1,2.0,11/3/2015,Chilis has changed so much over the years!! Too much!!! The food seems...fake. I remember loving the fries at Chilis...they used to be seasoned and delicious. Now they are always cold and unappetizing to even look at.  The food used to be served in baskets. Now it is served on weird square plates with fries in metal baskets. I keep convincing my husband to eat at Chilis but this was the last time. Our waiter was very kind. However it does not make up for cold disgusting food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Tabby S.,"Grovetown, GA",0,6,,2.0,1/5/2016,Wonderful waiters and service. The food was horrible. I hate to say this but I've only eaten there once and there will not be a second time. But the atmosphere was great. Just terrible food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2
Rick M.,"Augusta, GA",35,25,45,4.0,5/29/2015,"For my low-carb diet, I order the bacon cheeseburger without bread and garnishments then get a delicious side salad instead of fries...Yeah, the way I order ain't pretty as far as presentation goes but the food is delicious...their homemade pickles are awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Jake K.,"Atlanta, GA",37,229,224,3.0,3/14/2015,"We went to this place only because Logan's next door was so crowded. Food was decent; I ordered the full rack of Dr Pepper ribs, and I was sufficiently satisfied. We also got the chips with salsa and guac. Those were good too. The problem is that all our plates were overpriced in my opinion. $17.99 for a rack of ribs and like $10 for the chips. Ridiculous. Our waiter provided good service, but he brown-nosed a little too hard by asking us if everything is ok every 5 minutes. After tip, the meal came out to a little over $65 for a group of 4.

Matthew N.,"Brentwood, TN",7,51,8,3.0,10/27/2014,"Just like the Chili's in Evans...  Not really anything special, typical chain Restaurant.  Not real sure why, but chain restaurants like these have been seriously declining, while raising the prices.  Of Course I will probably come back, I mean if for nothing than their Chips and Salsa...which is one thing that has truly remained the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Monica K.,"Grovetown, GA",3,17,,2.0,6/24/2013,"Decent food at a decent price, but our waiter decided to take a break in the middle of our service so he went MIA for about 20 minutes after we received our food. The food was OK but the menu is horribly laid out. I know this isn't fine dining by any means but a menu that is less than 10 pages, would be a great start. It doesn't help that half the pages are full of pictures...Just stick with a simple menu, everyone knows the food isn't going to look anything like the pictures, so why bother? My husband and I only dined here because we received a free flatbread. My husband ordered a burger which was cooked pretty good but 5 Guys is better.  We probably won't be back but at least the flatbread was good. This isn't the worst restaurant in Augusta, that honor would go to Malibu Jack's, but you can do better..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Mearia D.,"Augusta, GA",5,15,8,4.0,8/19/2014,"I'm happy with this Chili's, especially compared to what it used to be. It probably helps to date one of the shift leaders service-wise, but the food is good and I love the redesign on the menu and the dining room in the past 12 months. I made my mom go back, she hated it previously, but even she's impressed by the improvements they've made. I would definitely feel comfortable taking friends or family from out of town to this location for a meal that is familiar and tasty, and the service is as good as anywhere else in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Kathleen M.,"Atlanta, GA",2363,1627,1470,2.0,2/8/2012,"I know a Chili's is a Chili's, but this isn't even a good one.  Their constantly redesigned menus seem to become more jarring to the eye each time around and increasingly difficult to read. I tried to focus on the ""lighter fare"" section, which meant under 750 calories. I don't know about you, but that seems like a pretty high limit: made me wary of what the caloric content was of other items on the menu. I went with the grilled chicken salad which was a hearty meh: the chicken itself was fine, but the lettuce was heavy on the iceberg and they just put plain Kraft shredded cheddar on top with some haphazard canned black beans. I can't cook and I'm pretty sure I could make something better at home.  Our server was nice enough but totally scatterbrained and seemed quite terrified of us. Food was a little slow to come out especially given how empty the place was. So yeah, it's a Chili's... and one I'd avoid at that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Estella B.,"Hephzibah, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/14/2014,"By far the worse Chili's I've ever been to. I was given a dirty cup twice, dirty appetizers plates. Shirmp tacos were way to spicy and watery.

Tanis L.,"Augusta, GA",5,12,,3.0,9/30/2015,"Usually love this place. Last time we were there, we had an unpleasant experience, and issues with the BOH manager. I talked to corporate about it, and was told the general manager of this location would call me back. He did so the next day, in which I missed his call that he made on his personal phone. I called back, and he answered. It was kinda  I told him who I was and he was very apologetic. He told me he wanted to make it up, and was sending something by mail. The ETA given was that upcoming Saturday. Well, that was almost two weeks ago. Kinda sounds like he was trying to get unhappy costumers off his case without actually fixing anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20

Ele J.,"Amherst, NH",127,12,15,5.0,2/14/2015,"my friend and i went during a super busy night, and were a little concerned about the wait time (45 minutes). however, we were able to hang out the bar area (self seating) and find a booth rather quickly. the staff immediately cleaned it from the previous people, and continued to be super attentive and nice the entire time. we forgot how busy the restaurant was because our waitress was so super friendly and kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed. i am not usually over impressed with chilis, but our night out was fantastic!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
Craig M.,"Columbia, SC",0,45,,4.0,12/7/2014,Very good experience! Food was very flavorful. Price was reasonable. The best part was the service ever server was very friendly and attentive.

Amy G.,"Atlanta, GA",48,159,7,2.0,11/13/2009,"We went to this Chili's on a Sunday night and sat in the bar. It was relatively quiet when we went in, but grew increasingly crowded as the wait for a table got longer.  Our waiter, who was doing a bad impression of a monosyllabic Tim McGraw, took our order in decent time. He came back 10 minutes later to inform me that the item I ordered (the chicken tacos) wasn't available because they were in the midst of changing up the menu. Um ok. Aren't you supposed to tell me what I can't get BEFORE I order? I ordered chicken casadillas instead. I wanted to argue that if I could order that, they had all the fixin's to make the chicken tacos, but I didn't want to push the issue. He then proceeded to take the orders of the three tables that sat down a now-good 15 minutes after us. So our food came out with all of theirs. Awesome.  Once it started getting crowded, our chip supply and drinks were left on E for far too long, and our food took its time, but finally arrived. Along with every one else's.  I mean we sat in the BAR. We obviously weren't there for a fine dining experience, but snappy service is a token of sitting in the bar. People in. People out.  One good thing? He didn't charge me for my side of sour cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20
