27,Crystal M.,"Port Huron, MI",17,12,,1.0,2013-05-05,"My fiance and I went on a slow early Sunday evening. We were seated immediately, there were empty tables around, and we were told that our server and another server would be taking care of us tonight. It took ten minutes to get water. Another ten to get our appetizer, Queso, which we ordered at the same time as our water. Our Queso was fine but our chips looked as though someone took a hammer to every chip in the basket. Shreds of chips. We found about 5 full sized chips inside the entire basket. After we finished the Queso the waiter finally walked by, looked at our chips, which he brought to us, and said, Oh, did you want a chip refresh?  We finally received our food after 45 minutes of waiting, and it was AWFUL. My fiance's quesadilla was crumbling because it was so overcooked, and my steak was supposed to be medium but was over well, and that is putting it mildly. I sawed through my little steak and it was crumbling as well. Is steak supposed to crumble? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988
22,Michael H.,"Edmond, OK",0,1,,1.0,2013-09-03,"Chili's seem to have lost that ""it's Chili's everything is good"".  Their queso and chips was greasy over cooked, chicken sandwich was fatty. Service was slow all the while it was not busy with customers.  Chili's is just not the same.  Oh yeah, clean the menus and drink menus had to wash my hands after handling them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116
21,Sheri S.,"Edmond, OK",0,13,,2.0,2014-04-04,"I just called an order to pick up , to go. It was right after work and I was very tired and hungry. When I got there there was a sign saying to see the bartender for your to go order. so I had to walk across the restaurant to the bar. It was very slow. there was only a few tables, there was no hostess, there was no bartender, there was a bunch of staff standing around talking. I stood there for a long time. Staff was walking by and just looking at me. Still no bartender, everyone was standing around talking. no one would go get someone to help me. They were clearly in between shifts. So I had to finally yell to the group of waiters standing around and ask them where the bartender was. I was very upset. The food here is very good but the service has really gone down hill. this is not the first time I've gone in here and had really bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
23,Jason B.,"Edmond, OK",10,33,58.0,1.0,2014-07-18,Where should I start.... we were greeted and seated quickly and our waitress was at our table within 3 min of us sitting but that would be pretty much the only time I saw her. One of my child's drinks had something nasty on the underside of it and it seemed like I was bugging our waitress when we asked for a new drink while snatching the cup from my wife she walked away without a word. One of our appetizers showed up on time and was good not brought by our waitress. Then the waiting game began..... it was about 30 min with no waitress. We had used plates and empty cups and no waitress .... then food arrives not brought by our waitress but a manager. and lucky me mine had hair in it so I play the waiting game again while my family eats. After 10 mins I get my meal and it looks like it was microwaved. Then the manager shows up and asks how everything is I respond with what I have described above and he says that he will take care of our dessert oh and I finally get my other appetizer as well the manager brought it. So we finish our meal and order our desserts . They arrive promptly and are wonderful.  Then the fun begins again they discounted one of the 3 we bought so I talk to manager and he responds with we normally comp a dessert not 3 when there is a issue.   We payed and will never be back there again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
20,Marsha B.,"Edmond, OK",24,27,4.0,1.0,2014-07-18,If I could give 0 stars I would! !!! Horrible service. My son's milk had nasty food inside of the lid and when I ask for a new one the so called waitress grabbed the cup out of my hand and walked away without saying a word but acting like it was horrible that I wanted a new one. After waiting over 30 minutes without our appetizer and empty drinks they bring out the food and my husband's has a hair sticking out of the top. Once that happens I unroll my silverware only to find nasty food rolled in with the silverware. The manager comes by and says he wants to buy us desert on them.... we order desert and they tried comping only 1 instead of 3 like he said. We had a horrible experience here more then just this time. I can promise we will not ever be back!!!! I would much prefer to go next door to outback steakhouse! Went there 2 nights ago and had an amazing experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,,,,,
25,A M.,"Edmond, OK",0,13,,1.0,2014-08-29,"This is the worst Chili's that ever was. Just don't go here. Unless you want a terrible server and mediocre food, this is not the place to go. Dare I say it, but this one time Apple Bee's across the street is even better than this place. Don't go to this location!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,,,,,

28,L W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,16,4.0,1.0,2015-01-02,"I went to Chili's tonight and I ordered my California Club online at 5:48 pm. I went to pick up my food around 6 and waited until the cashier got off the phone to pay for my food. My ticket says I paid at 6:11pm. I waited approximately 10 minutes after the time I actually arrived to receive my food and my California Club Sandwich was cold, not wrapped in foil, sloppy, and the torn up bread had slid off the sandwich. I asked the girl who brought my food to me for some toothpicks so I could hold my sandwich together and she said that they only had the long toothpicks and they would poke through the container. Then I asked her to tell the kitchen to heat my cold sandwich. She asked, ""The whole sandwich?"" to which I replied, ""Yes, at least the meat."" The girl brought me another sandwich with new, warm bread. I took my food home, opened my sandwich (which still wasn't wrapped in foil) and discovered the meat and cheese was still refrigerator cold. I drove 7 miles back to Chili's to get a refund and the manager told me, as he coughed over my food, that he would have his staff remake the food but it was my fault the food was cold because I took too long (23 min) to pick it up. I asked him, ""If the food was waiting on me, then why did I have to wait 10 minutes for it? He stammered over his words and said, ""Oh, I thought it was just sitting back there because you weren't here yet."" Then he came up with another lie and said that the California Club is usually served cold. I told him the one on Classen always makes it hot and it shouldn't matter if the sandwich is normally served cold because I asked for them to heat it up. (After I left I thought, ""If the sandwich is normally served cold anyway, then why did he blame the sandwich being cold on me taking too long to pick it up?"") After the manager grew tired from arguing with me, he offered to recook my food for the 3rd time. I declined because I knew he was just going to reheat that same sandwich and fries he was coughing over. Worst Chili's experience ever. I'm glad the manager didn't offer any coupons or anything because I definitely will not go back. I will say the young lady who brought my food to me was very nice and tried but the manager was the bottom of a donkey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond?start=20,,,,,

If you have read my reviews you know I don' easily grant positive reviews that are not deserved!  We will be back again soon.  Keep up the good work Chilis Edmond.

18,Michael F.,"Edmond, OK",10,149,47.0,5.0,2015-04-22,Great steak. Drink was weak so I just doubled up on the shot.. the service was great. She was very upbeat and on her toes... this Edmond location is the best location thus far..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
16,Becky S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",132,205,92.0,2.0,2015-05-05,We came in after a funeral service with quite a few people and they had no clue how to accommodate. They gave us two servers but were so disorganized and messed up on several of our orders and didn't give us our appetizers on time. And they also didn't know when to refill our drinks. 2 stars because they have a military discount which we always appreciate!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
17,Myka S.,"Ponca City, OK",3,3,,2.0,2015-07-15,"My husband and I both got some sort of chicken, and both dishes were almost inedible. Our waitress was nice just pretty slow; she started working the bar in the middle of our dinner too so we got neglected after that. I also ordered a to go soft drink and our waitress gave me a child size and a person in another section got the big cup. Not worth eating at. Much better choices in Edmond.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
7,Bella B.,"San Francisco, CA",364,612,365.0,5.0,2015-10-15,"My experience here was great. Good food, served quick and hot (very hot so be careful), friendly staff and lots of tv's to watch the games on. I don't have any comments on drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
14,Heidi W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",322,528,730.0,4.0,2016-01-11,"I kind of can't believe I am rating a chain restaurant so high but we have had two great experiences here in the last couple of months. Both times we came in with a large party and even though it was busy we were seated right away. The servers were great and attentive. The food was what surprised me, I had low expectations, but even if I had not set the bar low in my mind, the food was great! I had not been to a Chili's in a long time and the menu is unrecognizable - in a good way! A lot of fresh items. The steaks were all cooked as we ordered and seasoned nicely. The burgers were juicy. The salads and veggies were fresh. The sides were amazing. The drinks were good and strong and came out from the bar to our table quickly. The two things that were not so great was that both times the service really tapered off at the end of the meal. The servers were both attentive at first but then got busy and it took a long time to finish up the check and get out of there. Also, what is up with the drink and food order tablet at the tables. It worked okay for ordering but then the server spent quite a bit of time undoing whatever damage it did to our bill when we tried to pay with it. We are paying the server to take the order, and then take the payment at the end - so why is a tablet at the table necessary.  Anyway, busy inside so must be a good sign. Especially considering the terrible construction going on on Broadway right in front for months and months now. I would have never put it on the list to compete well with Charlestons and Outback that are right next door but it is definitely in the running and was surprisingly good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
13,Max S.,"Johnson City, TN",135,17,2.0,1.0,2016-05-03,I've had great experiences at different locations but after today's lunch I'm very disappointed. I sit at the bar where my drink order was promptly taken... But I was never offered a menu. I waited 10 minuets before having to ask. The bar staff was busy checking their phones. The food was cold and completely dissatisfying. This will probably be the last time I visit this location. The staff was very polite and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
12,Carey C.,"Edmond, OK",0,11,1.0,5.0,2016-07-20,Salmon was really good. Wait staff was pretty good and the manager was really helpful and kind. The desserts are better than I remember. Salads have been much better than I expected at fast casual. Surprisingly good place to watch games as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
11,Amanda P.,"Wellston, OK",13,13,2.0,3.0,2016-10-25,"When we walked in, we stood there for like 7 minutes and no one came by. Food was okay, dessert tasted like it came from the microwave. Service was great and food came out quickly. Disappointed in the sweet tea as it was not very sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
10,Joe S.,"Edmond, OK",0,7,,2.0,2016-12-22,"We have been there a few times because we live close and the app ordering is easy. However, the food is rarely warm and fresh when we get it. It tastes subpar. We have also not gotten some of our to go food a few times in the last few orders. Also, I'm not sure if it's this Chili's or all Chili's, but why does everything have to be incredibly spicy? From salads to chicken strips, it's like they pride themselves in showering food with overly spicy seasoning. Maybe my child likes their chicken normal and not spicy. Maybe a salad should be enjoyable and not set your mouth on fire. I had a dinner of fries last night because I could only have 3-4 bites of salad. Thank you for the hunger and heartburn in the middle of the night! It's just unnecessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,

3,Kelli D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",62,224,251.0,3.0,2017-05-12,"Our service during the lunch time rush was exceptional! All staff members were friendly and worked together to seat & greet guests, bring plates & drinks, and clear tables. I also highly appreciated the manager coming by to ask about our meals and helped refill a water glass. Two of us snuck out of there with a $17 tab (not including tip) with two lunch combos and a strawberry lemonade. The options on the lunch menu is acceptable, and the full menu is available at any time. The food itself (chicken enchiladas w/ broccoli & beans, and smoked chicken quesadillas with black beans) was just fine. Not piping hot, but warm; and enough to fill your belly without over stuffing. I GIVE A 4.5 STAR TO THE STRAWBERRY LEMONADE -- deducting only a half star because I like seeing the chunks of pureed strawberry & seeds in the glass. Overall good job for the Friday 12pm lunch date with my dad. Easily got seated and out the door in 45 min.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmond,,,,,
5,Patrick K.,"Edmond, OK",5,15,,1.0,2017-05-14,"This is the last time we will eat at this location. We've written them off before but always try to give them another chance. Ordered to go, food came out room temperature even though I showed up at the specified time. The amount of fries in one ADULT container was less than the amount in one kid's meal we also ordered. The order specifically asked for no onions...guess what, there were onions. The lady at the to go counter was unfamiliar with how to empty a gift card. Even after I explained to her to enter the exact amount left on the card, which I gave her, she had an attitude and would not enter the amount. ""I'm not entering an amount, I'm just swiping it like normal and it's declined"". She continued to stare at me as if I was the one with the incompetency issues. Poor choice for Mother's Day dinner.
