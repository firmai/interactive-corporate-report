41,Sharon S.,"Roanoke, VA",33,4,,5.0,2012-07-09,"My husband and i have been here twice now. It is our new favorite place. When we first went neither of us knew what to expect we had never been to a red robin. But we loved it. Both time the service was great. The atmosphere is casual. The staff is freindly and outgoing. They not only are on the ball with refills and such but joke and talk with you make you feel at home. I have had a double cheese burger and a mushroom burger both were the best burgers I have ever tasted. My husband had to other different burgers and has not stopped talking about them. The bottomless steak fries is my husband's favorite thing about this place. You can keep the fries comming as long as you want just ask, they are refilled free. The soda is high but is also refillable. Prices are good. Average for prices today. Two of us can eat for about $28.00. Give or take. Last time we ordered a pile high mud pie for dessert. Which we shared. It was huge and out of this world I would recommend it though it is about $5.00 something but well worth it. They also have shakes, floats and of course mixed drinks I can not talk about these as i have not had these. I also do not drink mixed drinks. It is kid friendly, group friendly.  It is a family atmospher very relaxed. Tvs everywhere, and great decore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001
22,Dave H.,"Boston, MA",22,132,67.0,3.0,2012-09-19,"Decent franchise restaurant.  While the menu is good, the atmosphere is not.  As a burger joint I was surprised to find a few healthy alternatives.  Veggie burger for example.   They also have a limited offer of salads, but the dressing options make it virtually useless to order. The onion rings stood out as the clear winner here.  Having said that, I found everything else ""ok.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

27,Danielle D.,"Roanoke, VA",12,15,2.0,1.0,2013-06-04,"WOW - I am in search for a meal on a Sunday night. Decided on Red Robin. Very nicely decorated but the service was below average. 4 employees walked by me while I was waiting to be sat - no hello, no nothing. After a 10 minute wait I was finally seated in the bar area where I was made to wait an additional 8 minutes before the bar tender came to take my order. She was obviously not interested in serving our table as she bitched about how bad her job sucked to another coworker the ENTIRE time I was there. Food was delicious and came out fast. If I wanted good food, I could cook. Went to RR for the experience which fell way below my standards. Not worth your time, if your looking for a good chain restaurant - Applebee's is less than a mile away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

When I walked in and told the hostess I was there to pick up an order, she just pointed to the bar and said ""there."" Stood at the bar where there were two employees working but not paying attention to me. Also in front of me were dirty dishes and glasses.  Nice. Would have gone around to another part of the bar but it had dirty dishes too.  Stood there for several minutes before I was acknowledged. A manager-type, based on clothing, came over and talked to me. In a couple more minutes, my food was ready - but wait, no soda? ""Oh, you wanted a soda?"" One of the bartenders rang up my order and was nice enough; maybe she thought I would tip her for handing me a bag and asking if I wanted utensils. (No, I'll eat the salad with my hands, Thanks, though.) The hotel shuttle driver told me that she had only been to this place once because of the poor service.

Bottom less fries literally came 6 fries at a time and luke warm. I ordered Cod burger, it was ok not worth the $12. My son got riblets and Mac and cheese, it was yucky and the sauces tasted like they came out of a can. $40 for the 2 of us to eat. If you like frozen food service food this is the place for you.

My wife and I went there last night for the gluten free offerings.  We sensed we were in trouble when our feet were sticking to the floor in the lobby.  Yes, they have gluten free buns but the hamburger really had no flavor.  My bottomless GF Sweet Potatoes fries were a joke.  When our food was served I asked for more SP Fries.  It came out 15 minutes later after I had finished my meal.  Our server even noticed they were seasoned meaning they were cooked in the same fryer as non-GF so she wouldn't let me have them.  This in addition to the sticky floors, food stuck to the sides of the tables and dusty furnishings will keep us from returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke,,,,,

Maybe 4 or 5 other tables.Workers all around. Walking by. Not once did any of them so much as look at us! After about 10-15 min someone finally came over and asked if we had been helped. Nope! She made some lame excuse that our waitress was helping another table, but she could take our order. Gee thanks. Bout time. So, she took our drink and food order. Then the manager came over and apologized. Offred us a free dessert. Nice enough, but too little, too late. While waiting for our food, I was able to glimpse in the kitchen as we were seated nearby. OMG!!!!! Ugh. Dirty dirty dirty. Trash overflowing, empty boxes on the ground, just gross! Seemed like alot of standing around, nothing getting done! Our food was ok.

Came here for lunch on a Friday and the place was fairly busy, but plenty of open tables. The hostess seemed to be disappointed that I didn't want to just sit at the bar.   I was led to an empty table and the waitress came by and told me how I could use the kiosk/tablet to order.  She took my drink order and left me to the device (as well as my own devices). I reviewed the menu on the tablet and attempted to order but the ""order"" button was greyed out.  I could see the food I wanted but just couldn't select it.  When the lady came back with my drink, she asked if I had any questions and I said ""yes, how do I order food?"".  She told me again to use the tablet but when I asked her to demonstrate she said ""Oh, this isn't working.""  She was friendly enough and tried a couple of times, then went off somewhere to make sure it was turned on or assigned to the table or something but it still didn't work.  Finally, she took my order the old-fashioned way. The food was fine.  Boneless wings and french fries.  They did come by and replenish my fries and my club soda as well.   When it came time to pay, I tried the tablet again and then it was working.   It was actually an easy process.    The food was fine and the waitress was friendly, I would just say if you have technology you want your customers to use, it should work.  And if it doesn't, your priority should be taking someone's order rather than technical troubleshooting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

BUT, while having an early lunch with few people yet in restaurant, the conversation from the party beside us was audible and disconcerting. What made it so was that of the two patrons seated, one of them was an employee at this Red Robin, but off-duty. Then an on-duty server walked up and began chatting. You couldn't help but hear the conversation about how both of these RR employees were discussing their separate love affairs. According to the conversation, they were married but sleeping with other married RR employees. Not only was the whole thing completely a sleeze-fest, but the on-duty RR server stood and chatted for about 15 minutes. If I were a manager, I'd be hot. Clearly the manager either is not supervising well or doesn't care. I'm a fan of RR's food, but this puts a damper on things at this particular restaurant.
