97,Joelle B.,"Chino, CA",58,50,3.0,1.0,2012-02-24,"Well I am very disappointed.  I use to be a chilies fan when I liver in northern California but this is the second time u have been to a chilis in Southern California and was very disappointed.  The service was horrible, we had to ask for drinks 3 different times for 3 people when we asked for them to all he full the first time.  The celery sticks that came with the buffalo wings did not coke with ranch but blue cheese instead, my poor little girl was disappointed since she loves celery and ranch.  Then the worst part is my chicken fajitas showed up with the skillet so burnt that my chicken, Bell peppers and onion tasted horribly burnt.  The manager did come out and replace the onions and Bell pepper and was friendly .  Nit to mention they sat us by the to go section and people were literally standing next to us and behind us. but after 2 dissatisfied trips I think ill stuck to places I know I will enjoy from now on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=120,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
64,L A C.,"Pomona, CA",4,13,,3.0,2012-05-09,"Chili's, Laverne is okay. It's not the best location, but the food is still pretty good. This location closes really early and lacks that fun atmosphere locations like West Covina and especially Diamond Bar have. This is most likely due to the city it's in. However, it's still a decent place to go for 'American food' when in the area. As mentioned before, the food is the same as any other Chili's. Personally, it's hard to taste any difference between the food from this Chili's and many other locations. The food is good and the drinks are okay. Also, customers could substitute items in an order. So that's great. The workers are generally nice. I've never had an issue. The servers don't have as much spunk or energy as the servers at the Diamond Bar location, though. Of course, I'm generalizing here. I've been waited on by a perky waitress once and a very friendly and talkative waiter, JD or JT, various times. He's a lot like the majority of servers at the Diamond Bar location, which is my favorite location because of the friendliness and great atmosphere. Last week he even changed the channel on the t.v. at the bar so my girlfriend could watch the Dodgers game. That was pretty cool. Chili's, Laverne is definitely not the best location. But it's alright. The servers are okay, substitutions are welcomed, and the food is just like any other Chili's. The atmosphere is a bit bland and the place closes around 9PM, so don't expect more than to eat a good burger and go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=100,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

We sat for another 25 minutes and no food was delivered, so we left.  Won't return. Tried to leave feedback on the Chili's website, but no luck.  The website doesn't accept feedback.  Guess they don't really care about their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=120,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

I do like this location more than others, the staff here is generally nicer than in Montclair where it's really hit or miss. They don't take reservations per se but you can call ahead and get your party on the list.  If you call ahead I highly recommend getting the name of the person you spoke to because on more than one occasion they could not find our name once we arrived.  Also, if they tell you there's no wait and no need to put your name down, insist. We've also followed that advice only to arrive and have a longer than expected wait.   As for food, I always like the enchilada soup especially on a cold day. We actually really like the skillet queso appetizer especially since it also comes with bottomless chips and salsa.  The chips are actually pretty good, very light and crispy.  The 2 for $20 meal options are decent and the molten chocolate lava cake is a favorite dessert to share. I especially like that they can effectively pack that to go if we're too full to eat it there.

Kudos to Chili's for offering some healthy choices. I had the mango tilapia with rice and broccoli. The rice was seasoned well and there was a heaping portion of avocado and mango on the fish.

My server greeted me immediately and knew exactly what I had ordered. She was friendly and fast, I had no problem with the service. The quality of food however was disappointing. I understand that when your order take-out, the food isn't going to be peeping hot and I expected that much but I didn't expect it to be almost inedible.  I ordered the original chicken crispers and fries and the both were over fried. You can immediately tell that they were not cooked properly.

Lately though it seems that the wait is longer and longer. The place will be packed, with people waiting for a table, but there is a whole section not being used. I understand the off time when a server calls in sick, but if it is consistent each week, that is a management problem.  Managers (or Corporate) trying to save a buck but cutting back on servers. And if you are going to have a hostess, she should be there ready to greet you when you come in, not bussing tables. Again corners being cut at the expense of service.

That was the overwhelming review from the three of us who dined here on the night in question.  The food was pretty good, the service was pretty good, the atmosphere was pretty good and the local craft beer we sampled was pretty good. The deserts we tried were terrible but as someone who isn't big into deserts I don't really care about that. I had a brownie with ice cream, the ice cream was poor, the brownie well below the standards I expect and overall it was kinda ""bleh"". Parking is good and plentiful, the waitresses (we were actually served by at lease three which I found strange) were all very pleasant and helpful.  The food is not outstanding but you don't really expect it to be when you go to Chilli's, do you? It was pretty good and I have no complaints.... except about the desert which needs work as I mentioned already.

67,Yilin L.,"La Verne, CA",41,11,,4.0,2014-02-06,"I went to Chili's alone in order to focus my observation of their service. The receptionist tenderly greeted with smile and led me to a small table with two seats near the kitchen. The noise level was a little high but within my tolerance zone. I checked the time, it was 12:05, there were only two table seated with consumers in my area, which has eight capacities in total.  The drink: Mango Ice Tea      The waitress reacted with a little shock due to my eccentric type of favor on drinks. Well, I really try to adapt some American life styles but I just love warm water when the weather is quite temperate. I did not want to be treated like a total alien so I changed my mind to order a drink when another waitress came to help me. I pointed the drink menu and asked her which one was sweeter, blackberry ice tea or mango ice tea. She told me that mango one was more popular and I told her I would try mango one. She left the table and came back quickly with two cups of drinks that only filled on the bottoms, both blackberry and mango, without ice as I requested. What a surprise! I tried both, they were pretty light, and I expected something stronger. I expressed my need and order mango ice tea. The waitress served me the tea with no ice but extra syrup. How nice she was! The mango ice tea only cost $2.79. The entrée: Mango-Chile Tilapia I ordered a Mango-Chile Tilapia as my main dish, which was priced at $10.49. It was a sautéed tilapia with steamed broccoli and fried rice. The tilapia was very fresh however with no gross sea odor that most people hate. It was delicately sautéed with garlic salt, parsley, black pepper, green chilies, and fresh lemon juice. After the cooking(sautéing) process, it was capped with fresh sliced avocados and tomato. The tilapia tasted a little salty, but basically fitted my flavor. It also tasted mildly sour, you would find out it was made from fresh lemon juice too. Furthermore, it tasted a little spicy- it probably would be very spicy for non-spicy eaters. I like this spicy flavor because it was well cooked and entirely mixed with other source. I gradually felt the hotness that evenly covered my mouth and then haunted for a while. The fresh avocadoes, tomato and steamed broccoli were the perfect match with the tilapia to me because I wanted my dish less salty, I only needed to dip them into the tilapia source. The fried rice was cooked with a few sweet corns, they did not add flavor but the fried rice looked more delicious.  The soup: Terligua Chile The tilapia was like an appetizer to me because lemon juice can make people want to eat more. I was basically full but I wanted to see how their soup tastes. I checked the menu and found out that Chili's did not have too many choices for soup. I ordered a Terligua Chile for $3.09, which was 50 cents less than regular price since I ordered an entrée dish. The Terlingua Chili soup was cooked with beef, beans and several kinds of scrunched vegies, on top were sliced cheese. The soup was creamy when I tasted it alone, then I blended the cheese and it became very sticky and more flavorful. The size of the soup was very tiny, however, I felt stuffed after I finished it. At that moment, the restaurant reached full house of capacity. It was 1:00 p.m. The Dessert: The Peanut Butter Skillet Cookie I would not eat this much if it was not for my curiosity. Even though it was not the first time I went to Chili's but I never really cared about the food in Chili's since it was not my type of food. After I finished my soup, the waitress came again to ask if I needed anything else. I told her I would order in ten minutes and I thereafter did order this big peanut butter skillet cookie with vanilla ice cream on top, the price was $5.89. The waitress served The Peanut Butter Skillet Cookie a few minutes after I ordered. The cookie looked very hot because it came with the skillet that just pulled out from the oven, with a handle cover, which prevents consumers from burning. The ice cream was dressed cameral which looked nice. I had a spoon of ice cream and it tasted like the breeze of summer, it was very mild but creamy. On the other hand, the cookie was very sweet but the peanut helped make it less greasy. ToGos: I asked to refill the ice tea and ended up not drinking at all due to a staffed stomach. I tried to ask if Chili's could provide a cup for my tea to go. As a result, the waitress served me with a bubble cup that contained half cup of ice tea because the bubble cup doubles the size of regular cup they use in the restaurant. I poured the tea thatI did not finish in the bubble cup, also I got a box for my cookie leftovers to go at 1:40 p.m.   One star cut due to no Wifi provided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=100,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.512,3.1600000000000006

We all opted for the Lunch combo specials $6, $7, or $8. House Salad with Citrus Balsamic Vinaigrette - pretty good staple salad, however the dressing tasted like thousand island, and was very thick. I'm glad they put the dressing on the side, I just drizzled the salad very lightly with it since it was very strong. Half Margherita Flatbread - it wasn't cooked all the way through. They messed up my order because my coworker changed her Margherita to chipotle chicken and so the waitress changed both of our orders instead of hers. Out comes the flatbreads and they give me chicken, and I told them I didn't order this. The manager, I assumed, was serving us our entrees, so she took it back, talked to the waitress and confirmed that we had two chicken flatbreads...never the case, since I am vegetarian!  Everyone got their meal and I was waiting for mine, but it came too quickly in my opinion and I was right. The pizza wasn't cooked all the way. The center was uncooked and so I ate the edges mostly.

Wait over ten mins not even kidding. No one comes by, we needed two boxes my husband got up to find the hotess no ones there he went to the other side of the restaurant and flags  down a waitress from another section she brought us boxes and the bill still never saw our waiter again.  The soup and salad I ordered would have been roughly $7.50.  The entree I got was $11.29 and they charged me for a dinner salad $2.99 that I didn't want. I ordered it when I ordered soup and salad. But if I ordered an entree from the start I would have never ordered a salad. The guy waited till all our food was brought to our table to tell me they were out of soup. He litterly set theside salad down and said im sorry were out ofsoup. he should have came over ten mins piror they whole time we were waiting and mentioned that. and not brought the dinner salad and said sorry were out of soup  would you like to order something else do you still want a side salad. nope not what he did.  clearly he had to enter in the computer to charge us. he should have noticed,  hey i wont charge them for a side salad since she didnt ge the soup and salad no.

Our second waitress walked by and I asked if I could get that by itself, not with the whole meal pictured. She said if she could ring it in like that I could. 20 minutes later as our food arrived I asked her if she ever got an answer to my salad question. She said ""your server told you no, you could only get it with the full meal"" I told her ""no one has told me that and I've been sitting and waiting for an answer so I could order a different salad if not"" she walks away. I don't remember an apology or anything. First of all, when our hostess sat us we were told we had two servers. Server number 2 blaming server number 1 was beyond ridiculous. The way she worded her response really bothered me. Take pride in your job and own up and apologize if you forgot. Second, do what you can to make the customer happy.

But I just have never been able to like the food very much. No matter how exciting your entree sounds, the food just tastes so generic and mass-produced.  My bf's son chose this place because they have little screens at every table where you can check out the menu and play video games. If a kid has choices and one choice involves video games, that's what they will choose. It's actually kind of genius for people who like distractions for their children, or rewards if they behave well in a restaurant. I ordered the Short Rib Enchiladas, he got the combination fajitas, and the lil one got the mac and cheese. We also got the fried pickles to share.  The short rib was probably the most bland I've ever had, and the mac and cheese looked/tasted just like Kraft blue box. Everything was good, but not GREAT. However, the bartender and servers were very, very nice, and we weren't rushed.

But you know what servers feel entitled no matter how shitty their service may be. So now I feel you want a tip you gotta earn it. I called the manager right after and explained to him the situation. We aren't cheap, and we didn't leave a tip for any other reason other then the service. He understood completely and explained that is his policy.

137,Amber H.,"San Dimas, CA",0,1,,5.0,2016-01-18,"Okay I work in a restaurant and all of these reviews can most likely be answered with this post my friend wrote.  ""To the people who have never worked in a restaurant:  1: if you only see 1 host do not expect that your table for 12 can be put together in a matter of seconds  2: if you see open tables that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be a wait. Usually when there's open tables it's because there isn't a server in that section, the server in that section is taking more tables then they can handle or the kitchen has 40 minute wait times on food. 3: there is always a reason a host will start a wait. We aren't doing it to make you mad, and if you don't want to wait then sit in the bar or leave you really aren't hurting our feelings.  4: don't get butt hurt if a host isn't up there in the 2 seconds you've been waiting, it's probably because they are bussing tables and helping the servers so that when they come back you can be seated instantly.  5: if you complain about the table you're sitting at don't expect to be seated where you want immediately, the hosts do rotation so that everything goes smoothly, they aren't sitting you in that table because they don't like you, they are sitting you there because that's how rotation works, and if rotation gets messed up because you see a table across the restaurant that hasn't been sat but you want it, realize that server probably just got double sat or even triple sat and has 6 other tables they have to attend to so don't get mad when you don't get the service you expect.  6: usually on a Friday, Saturday night restaurants are pretty busy, so always expect a wait and if there isn't one chances are you're lucky.  7: if your server has a full section (usually 6-8 tables at a time), and is taking parties of 6+ it usually means they are attending to 48 people at a time, so if your drinks have been filled in a timely manner but your chips and salsa have still not been filled give them a few minutes you aren't the only people they are trying to make happy.  8: if your food comes out wrong, cold Ect, don't blame your server. Say something and let them know. The servers don't cook the food so when there's something wrong with it it's not the servers fault (unless they accidentally ring in broccoli instead of French fries) or something but usually it's not the servers fault and usually on a busy night, food runners run your food so they have no idea what you ordered they are just bringing the food out to your table to help out their co worker.  9:don't yell at the food runner about your food being wrong, let them know politely if there's something wrong, you can get a lot further with kindness then being rude and angry.  10: it's Christmas time, so everyone is doing their best to save their money, but tipping 10$ on a check of 150 is so insanely rude, if you don't have the money to tip decent then don't go out to eat. The servers aren't working their ass off for you so that you can tip them under 10% they have families and friends that they would like to get Christmas gifts for too.  11: in most cases your server is working their asses off for you, getting refills for tables, appetizers, splitting checks, running food, bussing, clearing plates, and in the back constantly doing side work, running dish, making the strawberry lemonade you love so much, refilling ice Ect, they never have time to use the restroom sit on their phones or sit down and take a break, they are CONSTANTLY doing something and if you are sooo ignorant that you can't see that than please sit yourself at home and eat a TV dinner.  12: I understand that there are pretty terrible servers and things do get messed up but in a lot of cases there are a lot of good ones who work so hard and don't get recognition for it from angry customers and if you're someone who is constantly complaining about things I hope this helps you realize what things are really like, and if you still don't understand please try and work in a restaurant for 2 weeks and let me know what you think """,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=60,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.324,2.16

Recently went on a Thursday night at dinner time 6-7 pm. There were 10-12 people waiting and we were told it would be a 30-35 minute wait. No problem, except half of the restaurant was closed, when I asked why I was told they don't have enough servers to open that side. So said to the hostess ""oh someone called out sick""? She said no we only open that side on Fridays and the weekend. 0_0 so I walked over to the closed side of the restaurant and there were two employees sitting at a table doing paper work of some kind (papers spread out over 2 tables). So I asked the two employees why this side is closed they also said ""we don't have enough servers to open this section"". So I asked are either of you servers one said yes so I asked the obvious question ""why aren't you serving, are you on break"" she said ""no the manager has me doing this"". So my family and I left as did another party of 10 and a party of 4 that had come in after us and also asked the same question about half of the restaurant being closed. The manager on duty was Dana, I don't know if she makes the schedule but I'm sure she has the power to call in a server or two, or maybe tell the server doing paper work to grab an apron and seat a few more guests.

As a result, we had to go somewhere else and certainly missed out on their prime rib tacos.  However,  the real loser of the day was Chilis as they lost out on about $170.00or so because the staff didn't want to hustle a little and take on a big party.

Wife and I came here with another couple. we ordered the 2 for 20. Wife picked the 6 oz. sirloin and asked for Medium. . It comes on a skillet on top of a bed of asparagus. Outside was well done, inside was bloody al the way through. Server takes it back for extra cooking. she returns and asks my wife to check it. Wife cuts into the steak and finds a hole in the middle. It was actually black inside the hole. Our group and the server agreed it was gross looking. Wife asks for a new steak. Manager lady comes to our table. She has my wife's plate in her hand. She has all the personality of a mortician. Does not introduce herself. Simply asks my wife what is wrong with it. Wife says it has a hole in it. Manager tells my wife ""well, you did slice it'. wife says ""yes, that is how I found the hole"". Manager leaves without an apology. Server brings new steak. New steak is even more rare than the first one. Server offers to cook it longer. wife says no thanks. she will take it the way it is. Wife is a former server. She knows what happens if cooks get mad at customer. Wife ends up sharing fajitas with other couple. As we sit there, wife slices up her steak. Each piece was completely bloody. It is totally rare, not medium.  As we eat, manager comes by and gives wife $10 worth of Chili's Dollars for her trouble. Manager is not concerned at all she might be serving bad meat. Manager never smiles, never apologizes. Wife took her steak home and thought she would feed it to our dog. Our dog is 13 years old and has a few health issues.

Originally Dustin misheard me and had me down for some chicken tenders (I was in the corner furthest from him, probably my fault). When the dish came out I voiced my concern and within 5 minutes a piping hot chicken bowl was in front of me.  Everyone else's food came out timely and hot.

That was the last straw, I spoke to the host asking to speak with the manager and he asked why, I explained what happened and I said I didn't want to sit with her any longer, he said he would send the manager over and I said okay and sat back down. 10 minutes go by and the host keeps passing by seating tables and I finally stop him and he acts like I never asked him anything and asks me what I'm talking about and then he says, ""Oh the manager is busy right now so if you want to move sections you can ask your server."" I shouldn't have to ask our rude server if she will allow me to sit in someone else's section, so we stay at our table and continue to fake smile with her and then I see the manager passing by and I stop her and explain what happened and she says, ""I am so sorry this happened, I had no idea this was going on because NOBODY TOLD ME ANYTHING."" I noticed after that the host and her were talking to each other so I'm assuming they were friends which is why he didn't notify a manager. So the manager was very kind and apologized and offered us some coupons and said she hopes we give this location another chance. Now today we came back to try it out again and the first person we see is Kate and she makes eye contact and her face automatically drops and rolls her eyes. I don't know why we get the eye roll when it was YOUR fault sweetie, we didn't jump into your head and make you act so rude to us, you're mad because we notified the manager about YOUR wrong doing. So we talked to the host tonight and we were a party of three and we're quoted a 20-25 min wait. No problem, they were busy. After a couple minutes we noticed a table in the bar area leave so we decided to grab the empty table since it was self seating. We sat there for TEN MINUTES. NEVER GREETED ! But TWO tables sat five minutes after us (all Caucasian people) and he greeted them within a minute of sitting down. We were pissed. Not to mention, he made eye contact with me within two minutes of us sitting down. He also came to the table directly next to us and checked on them and still didn't come to our table. We then got up and asked the host to put us back on the waitlist because he was obviously avoiding us. Since our table was empty now, three more Caucasians sat at the table and guess who was there to greet them in less than a minute? The Caucasian server. I lost it. I asked the host to speak to the manager right away, as I was waiting I see BOTH KATE AND THE GUY WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR SERVER peeking their heads out together from the bar area, when Kate's section was on the complete opposite side of the restaurant, so now we begin to put things together and it sure seems like we were being ignored because these two are friends or something else. The manager, Darrin walks up and I ask if we can speak outside and told him everything that happened. I was aggravated. Found out the servers name was CODY. No it's not certain that he put us off and never came to the table because we didn't look Caucasian, but I what I do know is that I observed him greeting Caucasian people only. Darrin was awesome and gave us his sincerest apologies and offered us coupons tonight as well. We greatly appreciated this and we thanked him and we ended up going to the Montclair location because we didn't want to see those servers again tonight. Honesty don't see why I would ever be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne?start=40,2.2,2.52,2.52,1.924,2.3920000000000003

My wife could not eat her dinner so we waited for our  server to return. Which he was supposed to anyway to bring more water. We waited, and waited.

Then right after another family gets seated and we are still waiting to give our orders. Finally the server shows up but goes to the table that came after and takes their order then takes ours. Ok, no biggie. We get our food and I made a terrible mistake in ordering the chipotle chicken and waffle dinner. It was terrible. It was overly drenched in sweet sauce. Then the server asks us if he can get us anything and we both ask for ranch for our fries and he comes back with only one for my son. He never refills or even offers to refill my drink. To be fair, they did not charge me for my dinner. But, I was very upset and disappointed with the service. I almost want to take it personal because it was so bad.

So the next time I ordered a double and it was no better, the bartender discounted it to a single, but still, why are they doing this.   We ended up speaking to the manager by off chance and she was less caring about the issue than the bar bartender.  If you live in this area or need to stop there are far better places near by, better food and drink for better pricing and service.  We use to love this place, but I am guessing from time long gone... sorry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-la-verne,2.4,2.28,2.28,,2.328
