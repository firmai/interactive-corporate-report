4,Dawn C.,"Kokomo, IN",0,9,6.0,2.0,2015-05-16,Service was terrible. Waitress was inattentive and spent more time playing on her phone then helping us. Waited 3 times for refills and had to wait to pay check so long that we ended paying at a kiosk. Also wifi didn't work initially and hard to ask 2 times for help and have them reset. Food and drinks were okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kokomo-5,,,,,
3,Gary L.,"Eastpointe, MI",1,52,16.0,4.0,2015-10-08,"The Salmon is always good, service was excellent. They know how to make a good Captain & Coke, and desert this time did not arrive melted as before. The waitstaff had nice clean uniforms, but they appeared hurried and a bit frazzled, something management should address. All in all, a good visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kokomo-5,,,,,

The staff is very courteous, friendly, fun, and prompt! Can't wait to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kokomo-5,,,,,
1,Dan J.,"Noblesville, IN",10,19,17.0,1.0,2017-01-07,"I stopped in for a bite after a great day with friends. I ordered the pork chop and requested that it be cooked to a medium.  The server look apprehensive and said she would have to ask the manager. In a short bit she came back and said he cook and the manager said no and stated that they had to cook it well done because it was a health code violation to do otherwise. I spoke with the manager while waiting for my server to come back for me to change my order and I explained that there was no health code that prevented them from fulfilling my request. He instantly became defensive and stood over me in a bit of menacing manner. He said that he could tell from my facial expressions that I was angry. I explained that I was just unhappy that I was being told an untrue statement as an excuse. I suggested that he say it's company policy, but he insisted that he was right about the health code. Well Mr. Manager, in may of 2011 the USDA - recommend that pork be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees, 15 degrees cooler than the previous standard. That is about medium in doneness. Please see:  I don't like being lied to and then treated in such a manner and will make sure to tell everyone I know about how your store treats it's customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kokomo-5,,,,,
0,Ruth C.,"Elizabeth, IN",10,88,5.0,4.0,2017-11-25,"Love their 2 for $20 deal-- especially since they added the option of two salads instead of sharing an appetizer.   Hubby and I always get Caesar salads, and he almost always gets the chicken fingers basket (but pays the upcharge for sweet potato fries).  I usually get the cedar grilled chicken, and I love the cranberry rice that comes with it.  Today,  our Caesar salads were extremely light on dressing,  but everything else was perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kokomo-5,,,,,
