84,Marc R.,"Morris County, NJ",30,295,25.0,2.0,2012-01-06,"I'm being generous...only because the server was a really nice kid who was trying hard to make us feel comfortable.  It's the food that's the problem.  If not for the server working so hard, I would be giving Red Robin a one star rating. This is just like any other chain, it's interchangeable with Fridays, Ruby Tuesday and son on.  The only difference is that there aren't any other ones in the area.  I have been to one in VA a bunch of years ago and remember the food being better.  It probably wasn't, I probably just evolved.   Like I said, the server was nice, attentive and even cheery.  They definitely earn points for their customer service.  The meal I ordered tasted nothing like it was described in the menu.  The chocolate milk ordered for my son was more like an over sweetened milkshake, obviously just a crap load of Hershey's.  Be original and try not to kill off the youngest of clients.  The onion crisps or whatever they are called were nothing more than a pile of tasteless grease.  The chicken on my sandwich was very mediocre with zero flavor.  Even the bun was lousy.  It all tastes like mass produced slop that will kill you if you eat it often enough.  I would rather eat good tasting food if it's going to kill me. If you aren't into flavor or real food, go for it.  Otherwise, head over to another nearby grease joint that at least has flavor and semi original decor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=80,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

This place was clean and the service was quick by super friendly and attentive waitress. I'm so sad there aren't any Red Robin restaurants in NYC or Queens.

90,Nancy M.,"Sparta, NJ",6,107,1.0,3.0,2012-06-02,"I was really waffling between two and tree stars on this place and decided on three because only one item was yucky poo.  My spouse order a cup of clam chowder that was very good.  We also had pork ribs that were a little greasy but overall OK. I order a cheese burger, and this is where the yucky poo come in.  The meat appear to have been precooked, and left to sit for a re-warm,  dry and tasteless doesn't come close to describing this, it came with a stale bun and an browned out piece of ice burg lettuce.  I cut the burger in half,  piggy the spouse ate all of his commenting that it didn't taste all that great . I basically took a bite of my half and left the rest.  The waitress came over and asked how we like the food. I gave her the old yucky poo and the manager came over.  She actually refunded the price of the burger, even though piggy the spouse had eaten half of it.  I was pretty impress that they did this.  I didn't expect this.  The service was good. The decor is nothing special, it's a chain, but a chain that appears to be trying to listen to its customers.  The TV was tuned to a rerun of a 1990's football game (What with that?)

I would love to try more menu items but I can't seem to let go of my sautéed shroom burger. The French onion soup is an excellent complement. The bottomless steak fries are a fantastic touch and I can search for the bottom! Waitstaff seems to get pissy if you want more than 2 refills but I scavenge off my other party member plates after that point anyhow; it just helps us leave quicker. If you bring kids and they order from the children's menu be sure to keep away from the pizza, it is GARBAGE. You wouldn't expect the child pizza at a burger place to be anything to write home about, but not even my toddler would eat it.

112,Tristan B.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",38,116,19.0,4.0,2012-11-05,"Decent burger place. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but nothing beats Red Robin's strawberry lemonade. I went here post hurricane for a warm meal and some heat. The place was packed, but I was expecting that since nobody had power and wanted some place to warm up. What was really neat is their wait system. We came and were told that there was a 30-45 minute wait (can't blame them!). The hostess took our information on an iPad (which I thought was neat) and also took my cell phone number. What they used with the phone number was about 30 minutes later texted us to tell us that our table was ready! We were able to walk around the mall and not worry about our name getting called when we were gone. We walked in when they texted us and were immediately seated! Moreover, in the initial text, they give you a link to check on your place in line. Red Robin is known for their burgers, so that is what I got. I am a sucker for hot food so I ordered the Cry Baby style burger (ghost pepper ketchup, fried onions, among other things). The burger came with their unlimited fries. I also ordered the strawberry lemonade. The strawberry lemonade came in a pretty neat glass. The lemonade comes with real strawberries in it which were so good. While the glass is deceptively small and the drink is on the higher end price wise, it is bottomless, so you are not actually being ripped off! The food came out really fast. The burger was pretty good. All the ingredients worked well together (I added some cheese since it wasn't included). Since it was named the Cry Baby burger, I expected to be crying, but it was far from hot. I didn't break a tear or a sweat. The burger was good even though I didn't cry. The fries are really good steak fries as well (these are also bottomless). Overall, it was a good experience. We had to wait a little for our check, but otherwise service was decent. Will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=100,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.32,3.2000000000000006

When we were finally seated ny the same manager she saw the look on our faces and gave us a free appetizer-she was awesome and I'm sorry I didn't get her name.  Our waiter got to us quickly and we all got our drinks quickly (thank GOD since I needed a beer that night).  We all ordered burgers or chicken sandwiches and when they came it was like a bunch of sharks in a feeding frenzy.  It may have been the hunger, or the tiredness, but the Prime Chophouse burger was seriously one of the best burgers I ever had.  You know what I mean...when it's so good you don't want to finish it because then yuo'll just be sad that the feeding is over?  Yeah, THAT good.

83,Julia L.,"New York, NY",269,313,19.0,2.0,2012-12-10,"This was a stop made in route to go home for the holidays... I've experienced better.  Not to say that I really expected too much from Red Robin, I mean in my opinion its literally just one step up above a fast food restaurant... if that.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and a margarita - hey, it's the holidays, it's time to celebrate! The rest of my party ordered the same small burger, made the way they wanted and with a order of Onion rings, we were ready to eat.  As our food came out, the rest of my party did not like their burgers one bit. Thankfully my chicken sandwich was scrumptious, although that could be for the massive amount of mayo they lopped onto it... whatever, I was hungry. Additionally, my margarita wasn't too strong and that was a bummer. When it comes to restaurants I usually don't judge them based upon their lack of food, especially a place like this. The reason why it gets a lovely two stars is due to the fact that our waitress just wasn't nice. Having worked in restaurants before, I know what good quality service is and she just did not cut it.  Needless to say, my tip reflected her behavior and I will not be returning.

123,Melissa A.,"Rockaway Township, NJ",2,31,,1.0,2013-08-13,"There is a reason why I no longer frequent this Red Robin location, despite the fact that it is right in my own backyard. Mistakingly, last week I made an exception after receiving an e-mail regarding my free birthday burger as part of the Red Robin Royalty Program. In a nutshell, this Red Robin location truly is ""for the birds""!!! Since its opening a couple of years ago I don't think I can really remember a time where the food didn't take FOREVER to come out, regardless of whether they are busy or not. Just read the reviews...nearly every reviewer says exactly the same thing! Even the people at the table across from us had complained about the ridiculous amount of time that it was taking to receive a burger, and had something comped on their bill...a typical sight at this Red Robin. My husband and I waited over a half an hour for our food, in which time our server never gave us any updates on the status of our meals. After all, the servers already know the deal...this is commonplace here. Besides the fact that my patty melt came out without onions, it was also burned to a crisp and black on the edges. By the time I had locked eyes with our server and signaled that I needed him, my husband was nearing the finish line on his dinner. I had come to the decision that I was not going to place a second order and wait close to another year for near frickin' fast food. I told our server that I was sending back my food, and as usual they send the manager right on over. The manager seemed pleasant enough but after a while you just get sick of hearing the same old ""schpeel,"" if you know what I mean. He admitted that although there was no excuse for everything that transpired that evening, they are currently understaffed and are always trying to improve on things. It killed me to not respond, ""I guess you have been understaffed since you opened your doors,"" but I bit my tongue. Otherwise I was painfully truthful in my complaint, and everything that I have typed in this review I stated to the manager. I even managed to tell him how I have never experienced any problems at their Clifton location, which is ALWAYS busy! He asked me if I wanted anything else but I told him that I didn't feel like waiting again, that my husband was basically done eating, and that we hadn't planned on being there that long. I'm not looking for a handout or anything, but just believe that a good manager would have comped my husband's burger...but figured perhaps they didn't because with all the comping going on there they must be near bankruptcy! Afterwards we ended up stopping by McDonald's, and even though I don't like their burgers very much anymore it was soooooo much more worth it! No aggravation, no wait (unless you count five minutes for FRESH fries!), and all this for a fraction of the price!

Our most recent visit saw us waiting 30 minutes just to receive the guac dip appetizer and a kids meal. Once the meals came, they somehow managed to forget the onion straws on one of the burgers. We didn't dare send it back for fear of how long it would take.  Regarding the guacamole dip, I don't know why Red Robin has decided to shrink it so dramatically, but it is no longer worth ordering.

It's nice to have a place in the mall with table and a bar, but the food - typical chain restaurant fare - is mediocre at best.  But Friday had to have been the worst experience. David was our server and he was extremely unhelpful, slow, and completely absent (until he wanted us to pay). It took us 15 minutes to get drinks to the table and get our food order taken (even though we mentioned we were ready to order everything when we ordered our beers).  When the beers did arrive, the glasses were filthy. Lipstick and grime on both. We were lucky we ordered bottled beers because David didn't return until well into our meal to see how everything was, so we would have been waiting a while. He wasn't even around for us to mention anything. He did apologize for the excessively gross glassware when he did finally check on us.  The orders were correct, but the food is never truly great. But that's a problem with the chain as a whole rather than an issue with this specific restaurant.   Once we finished our burgers, it was clear that David wanted us out, even as we were still finishing our drinks. He asked if we were familiar with the pay at table system (I was), so he mentioned we can pay at any time, no rush. Two minutes later, he came back to see if we had questions about it; we didn't. Another moment later, he came back to ask if we were going to use the system or wanted to pay in cash. In the guise of being helpful, he offered to split the check for us separately. This was nice, but something I've done myself as a customer before. So it read as forceful. He brought up the check on the tabletop system again for us to show us. We took the hint, chugged our drinks, and paid.  We were not there an excessive amount of time, we were ignored for most of our stay, then pushed out the door.  And while David stood out on this particular visit, I would hate to pinpoint him. I have been to this location several times and the service is never very good.

RR's burgers are consistently delicious! Moreover, the chain is always showcasing some new burger creation; I think their newest creation is a purger sandwiched between ramen noodles. The RR at the Rockaway mall is large and relatively clean. The large space yields itself for plenty of seats, so waits are not usually an issue. The staff is friendly and, service is snappy. The food is great; and with unlimited french fries who can complain. You can't go wrong with your choice of burger here.  However, if you are overwhelmed and not sure what to choose from the mammoth menu try the royal red robin burger. The royal red robin burger is a tasty bacon cheese burger that is topped off with a sunny side up egg. It is magic between buns! The burger oozes with farm fresh goodness! Seriously!...what other burger joint incorporates all of your favorite farm animals (cow, pig and chicken) between two buns?!  The fries are piping hot and endless. Also, try the new pickle coins...these fried pickles are hands-down the best pickle chips on the face of the Earth! They are the right blend of salt, sour, vinegar and crisp. RR is not the best burger place, but it is a great burger chain. So fly on over to RR for consistent burgers and yummy fries.

33,Mike W.,"Newfoundland, NJ",56,48,37.0,1.0,2016-08-23,"Two years ago,  my Yelp review of this location would have been drastically different.  This chain, not just this particular restaurant, has significantly gotten worse.  I suspect it is the usual corporate effect, but the changes are considerable.   I do not like how they are now pushing the ""Burger and Brews,"" because you can do one thing good,  but two things crappy.  This is applicable to Red Robin, because before they focused on Brews, the burgers were good.  Entrance:  You can enter either from the street side, or Rockaway Mall side.  As of recent,  I have not encountered much of a wait.  If the Hostess quotes you a 20 minute wait,  it will really be 10.  Who knows why they overestimate that much.  A negative aspect is that they got rid of their benches out in the mall, for waiting customers.    The hostess is always quick to greet.  For some reason, they always want to seat customers at the tables directly next to the entrance doors, while other tables are open.  They got rid of the one table near the mall entrance, where you were essentially eating your meal with waiting customers. Decor:  I have no idea why they re-designed the restaurant the way they did.  Not only did they get rid of waiting seats, they put up barriers to section off parts of the restaurant.  This makes everything feel more confined and cramped.  I believe there are actually less seats on the floor,  as there were before the monstrosities.  Plus,  the place just does not feel as clean as it was before.  For instance, my table during the last visit still had crumbs on it. Food:  My family and I generally stick to salads and burgers.  If you want onion rings, get them as a side to your burger and not the tower appetizer.  Financially, it is cheaper to subsitute them for your French fries. Over our visits during the past months, we have had problems with our burgers.  From being overcooked,  undercooked, tasteless,  greasy,  and wrong toppings, we have had it all. For instance, my burger during the last visit was undercooked but I ate it anyway and got a stomach ache.  Almost every time, we send the Burgers back to the kitchen and management ""Comps"" them.  I try not to be a pain, but I want my burgers how they are ordered. I would be remissed if I also did not mention the issue with the salads.  Before all the changes,  the salads, particularly the Southwest Salad, used to be a very big portion and fresh.  Now the prices were raised and the overall salad got smaller.   On our last visit,  the avocado was fresh but lettuce was browning.  It was a very poor and sad $9 salad. Conclusion: The question I would like to present is if corporate is aware of these changes, and how many other customers are having problems as well.  There is only so many meals they can write-off before correcting their mistakes.  Due to the lack of competition in the area,  I continue to be a patron of the establishment.  Time will only tell if Red Robin leads to the same demise as Fuddruckers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.02,2.64

For a place where everything is deep fried or burgers are put through a conveyor belt to cook, it shouldn't be this difficult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=20,2.68,2.7,2.7,,2.692

Too bad I'm not too into chain restaurants, but after not coming here in a while, I thought it was time to give it another shot. I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger. It was a bacon cheese burger with a sunny side up egg, mmmmm. I'm starting to salivate again just typing about it. The service was good and speedy for a Friday night. The restaurant looked like it was packed but we were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was a sweetheart and was very patient when we didn't know quite what we wanted yet. Gotta love the bottomless fries and soft drinks! Cons: A little too greasy for my taste. My orange cream soda just tasted like cream soda with whipped cream. My boyfriend decided to try the new Blue Moon shake, but had to send it back because it was just foam and lacked the Blue Moon taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway,2.52,2.71,2.71,,2.6340000000000003

I ordered an iced tea with kettle one thanking like every other place it would be charged as a kettle one mixed drink they charge me for a full ice tea plus the Price of kettle one?? They said they don't use a full shot in there mixed drinks that's why they charged me separate. I guess you don't want to drink there since they're ripping you off. Wanted to mention first when we walked in the hostess had not one ounce of personality don't know where they got her from. The server was OK but needs a lot more training. Came back wants to ask us how our meals were after the appetizer and meals came out at The same time. We were never asked if we want it anymore unlimited french fries. The rolls on the burgers  fell apart. Maybe they should shut this place down at this point,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=20,2.36,2.56,2.56,,2.48

Guess we are supposed to pass it around and share?!? The waitress was friendly, she just had way to much to do. Waited about 45 minutes for food when the people next to us who came after were served in 10 min.  Should have gone to 5 guys across the parking lot!

0,Kelsey B.,"Franklin, NJ",86,4,,3.0,2017-11-19,"We recently went to Red Robin in between shopping for a quick bite to eat and a get a drink. We sat at the high tables near the bar. We ordered our first drink and waited 20 minutes to receive them, even though the bar was right in front of us. We eventually placed our order, asking for an appetizer to start. It took a while for the onion rings to come out. Shortly after receiving the app, our main course came out. They really don't give you enough time to finish one meal before the next comes out.

6,Dave O.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",97,143,201.0,1.0,2017-11-23,"I am so upset at my experience here.  The only positive thing was that our party was seated very quickly.  We were greeted by our server who took our drink order.  Upon placing our orders we waited and waited. It took around 20 mins to get our two burgers and two chicken dishes.  For the $52 price tags we got cold fries (who would want bottomless cold greasy fries?), unremarkable tepid bland burgers incorrectly cooked - of course without the blue cheese that was in the menu, white bitter lettuce and a very cold seating area.  My wife's refill of sweet potato fries finally came out after we were done receiving the check and paying.  Poor service, a very poor experience and a dirty restaurant with straw wrappers and used napkins on the floor leaves me no reason or desire to return.  When I asked my son how many stars it had here, he said 2.5.  I was not surprised and rather disappointed.  In VA, RR was a nice pleasant experience.  In NJ, not sure what's happened.  We will not be returning and should have gone to five guys or White Castle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway,2.28,2.48,2.48,,2.4

The service was kind of slow and the place was dirty. The bathrooms weren't well kept and the silverware wasn't all that clean to be honest. The spinach artichoke dip was pretty tasty as well, but the chips they give you stick all together. I must admit though, afterwards I was very thirsty!
