11,Barbecutioner K.,"Hawleyton, NY",26,495,154.0,4.0,2017-02-04,"I've never been to a Red Robin before, and I hadn't really planned on going to this one until I had a recent opportunity to eat here for free during a soft opening, and I gotta say that the food was better than I was expecting.  first they brought out a complimentary lemonade. it had strawberries in it and it was good but a little too tart for me to want to drink a whole glass of it. For an appetizer I had the boneless wings. I'm not usually a fan of boneless wings, they're alright but I'd rather have regular chicken wings, but these were decent, they were nice and crisp and the sauce was good. They came with chips too, which I wasn't expecting. They also came topped with onion straws, which was a nice touch, but there was no dipping sauce for them. I ended up getting the ""fiery ghost tavern double burger"". Overall I liked it, but it didn't come out as a double, and I was fine with that, I know the kitchen is probably still working some kinks out since they just opened (actually, I don't think they're even officially open yet) and it was still a filling burger. It had ghost pepper sauce, raw jalapenos, fried jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, and pepper jack cheese. It had some kick to it but it was nowhere near as spicy as I thought it would be, which is weird because I feel like the jalapenos in it still had the seeds on them, which is supposed to mean heat! The bun was super fresh too and even though the meat was well done it was still juicy, and that's actually just how I like my burgers... well done doesn't have to mean dried out, some places don't seem to get that but fortunately Red Robin gets it right. I didn't think I was going to like the steak fries because I tend not to like bigger fries, but they were also done pretty well. They're served ""bottomless"", but honestly I could only eat the one portion, and trust me, I can eat!  Overall it was a pretty satisfying meal. The place looked nice but it definitely had a chain feel to it. A lot of the servers were pretty young, but the server I had was nice and as attentive as she could have been in a super busy restaurant. There was a girl who was greeting people at the door too and she was super polite, which definitely made the experience a little nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
16,K. E.,"Binghamton, NY",0,33,2.0,4.0,2017-02-18,"Not really a fan of chain restaurants, but I thought I would give this place a try, since I very much love a good burger.

13,Keith D.,"Endicott, NY",25,9,2.0,2.0,2017-02-23,"Ok so they have only been open three weeks. Still a long wait and while waiting at the bar which was also packed we were asked to move several times as they seemed to pack  as many tables into such a small space. Only one bartender yet 4 hostess,  seemed odd.  Our appetizer never came out and I guess endless fries means one order and it ends, no refills.

4,Anthony D.,"Vestal, NY",0,50,12.0,2.0,2017-02-25,"I wanted to love this place.  The hype over its opening and the buzz about how good the burgers were got to be overwhelming. I went on a Thursday night and here is my quick take: Expensive - Gourmet burgers are $14 ($13.49-$14.49 if I recall).  That's just crazy.  One of the burger/fry deals they have is $6.99 - maybe I'll go back and try that some day.  Down the road there are several options including Gourmet style that are less money and frankly taste better. Taste - Good but not oh wow great on the burger. Fries are steak fries which I don't like.  Some people might.  I got garlic fries which I paid extra for and had almost no garlic taste.   Atmosphere - LOUD!  Their interior seems conducive to reflecting and bouncing sound all over the place.  I could barely hear who was across table from me.  They also I think have packed in as many tables as is probably allowed by law.  I felt sorry for people sitting in the interior space (I had a booth thank goodness) and watching waitresses have to shimmy in between chairs to get to people.  Being a waitress/waitr here would be annoying simply because of that. Table Kiosk - Don't use. They should try putting the print in something that doesn't require glasses to read.  Couldn't get it to swipe my card and was lucky actually because when it didn't work I got my magnifier on my phone camera out and noticed a $2 charge for ENTERTAINMENT??  What is that?  It had to be removed by staff/manager. Hostess/Seating - I thought this was actually pretty good. They were packed but organized and they text you when you are ready.  Good thinking vs the buzzers I think.  People had to wait outside but that is to be expected as it is new and popular right now because of curiosity. Finally, I'll note they really rushed the opening of this place and packed way to much in a small space.  There is limited parking.  The asphalt is filthy and muddy because of constructions.  There are huge ruts and chunks of asphalt coming up already (it just opened 3 weeks ago).  Stairs from lower lot are close requiring a lengthy walk around lot to get to front.  Most of the parking is in the back vs conveniently in front.  They should have set these buildings back farther from road and increased parking in front.  I feel sorry for the other businesses between the two restaurants as people (me included) will be frustrated with the parking situation. Not sure if it is appropriate to name names here but you'll be better off further east and going to Coppertop for a burger. Cheaper and tastes better and atmosphere is better.  They don't pack you in like sardines.  It is a local/regional chain too vs this large corporate machine.  Even five guys is cheaper and fries are better.  Or if you want truly local go to Spiedie and Rib Pit - they have great burgers for less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,
14,Alexander T.,"Endicott, NY",2,1,,4.0,2017-02-25,"Red Robin is a standard burger place. The price is a bit higher than I expected, but the food was actually pretty good! They have a HUGE variety of burgers, but I am not a fan of most (please know, I have a very strange pallate). Despite advertising burgers as their specialty, I would very strongly suggest something other. Their burgers, while abundant and quite good, lack simplicity and go waaaaaaaaaay over the top for style (they have one with hash browns, fried onion and cheese). For me, their other options, like a salad or chicken sandwich, are my personal favorites and recommendations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,

8,Glenn G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,35,17.0,3.0,2017-03-16,"As with most other reviews, mine is on par. This place is way overpriced for what you get. $13.99 plus tax for a 7 ounce burger is robbery. The lack of getting a burger cooked to your liking is just asinine. Some pink or no pink is NOT how I would define a place that professes to be a gourmet burger restaurant. There are really only two reasons for this rule: inferior meat quality which needs to be over cooked to prevent people getting sick, or incompetent cook staff who are trained to cooked via a timer. They claim their meat is a mix of chuck and brisket. Frankly, the diner 1/4 mile away makes a tastier burger at 1/3 the price.  Staff was friendly and quick to bring refills.  The steak fries are very good. We also opted to get steamed broccoli with one burger. But that's all they do to it. Steam it. No salt, no butter, no flavor. Disappointed.  The menu had a nice selection of items, but the prices for what you get are just off putting. $4 soft drinks regardless of unlimited refills is also a rip off. So two burgers and two soft drinks with tax cost $36. Wow. I could've had a three course Italian dinner for $18 a person.  Well, this chain better get in line with its pricing, or I suspect it will not last. Cramped seating is also a common complaint. Even booths were snug. I will get my burger fixes at the Take a break diner where I get what I want, how I want at a reasonable price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,
9,Linarian H.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,29.0,1.0,2017-03-20,Waitresses are idling. Bad attitude. Burger patty is too bitter cause it's burnt. The waiting time is too long . Won't go here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,
2,Amber C.,"Flushing, NY",292,146,594.0,3.0,2017-04-11,"I was super excited when the establishment first opened in Bing, but the wait times were extremely long for the first few months of opening (at least 2 hour waits). After waiting for the hype to die down, I decided to finally try Red Robin. First and foremost, please note that this is not a gourmet burger place. They may claim to be, but their burgers are just random creations of ingredients put together. Having said that, it isn't a bad thing, I think all of the burgers I've tried so far are tasty and extremely filling. The best part is that they all come with bottomless steak fries, and if you don't want those you can always substitute with sweet potato fries, or even broccoli (at an extra cost). There are loads of options of different types of burgers and I definitely am aiming to try as many as possible. If you join their rewards program, after buying nine burgers you get the tenth free! I would not recommend any other entree on the menu except for the burgers though, because obviously it is what they do best. I have not tried many of their appetizers, but their onion ring stack seems to be the post popular. They also have some bottomless beverage options (nonalcoholic) which can certainly quench the thirst of all the salt you're consuming. The alcoholic beverages aren't too bad either, the beer milkshake is unique but I definitely feel like they put no alcohol in that drink.  The service is what really knocks down my rating. Even when they are not busy, all of the waiters/waitresses seem extremely unimpressed and just can't wait to clock out at the end of the day. They rely on the machines on the table to place your drink/appetizer orders, when most of them don't work. I definitely think the service can be improved if they want to keep their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,

27,Jennifer G.,"Binghamton, NY",0,6,2.0,5.0,2017-04-20,"Awesome!!! They totally deserve the five stars. Our waitress was very attentive and brought everything in a timely manner. I was with a group of four others. We had the fried pickles for an app and they were done perfectly, not to greasy and the dipping sauce was good. They all got milkshakes, salted carmel and they said they were delicious. They had a nice variety of burgers on the menu as well as things for those that didnt want a burger. I opted for the simple burger with mayo, lettuce, ketchup, pickles and grilled onions, it came out perfect. They have a lot of substitutions which was nice if you dont want fries. Everyones food was hot and all correct. I got sweet potato fries which were delicious. The waitress made sure our drinks were refilled and asked us if we wanted more bottomless fries. The others got the garlic parm steak fries and said they were good. For dessert we had salted truffle sticks with fudge and berry ketchup, very good, very fudgey. I highly recommend this place you can tell it is managed very well. The staff was well trained and knows how to treat the customers. The lobby was full of people waiting when we left and they were moving them right along to tables. I will be back again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal?start=20,,,,,

25,Marta G.,"Endicott, NY",0,16,6.0,2.0,2017-04-23,"We ordered the short onion ring tower (very greasy), prime rib sandwich and southwest salad, as we heard the burgers were not a good pick from several sources. I must say the quality and flavor was disappointing. I don't understand why the place is so crowded. The tables are packed together  very tightly and people are out the door waiting. Waitresses even had a tough time moving between tables as there never seemed to be enough space with people being seated or standing to leave. I did not like the way the waitresses overly encouraged you to use the kiosk to order food and pay. Our waitress wasn't even the one who gave us our appetizer and entrees. I don't understand why I'm tipping a waitress who doesn't want anything to do with us, and seems annoyed any time I want to order something from her, and not the screen on the table.  I gave it two stars because I will say it was clean, and I didn't get sick.  I will not be returning as it was very expensive compared to better quality food I can get anywhere else in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal?start=20,,,,,
3,IrregularPant S.,"Binghamton, NY",2,93,71.0,2.0,2017-05-21,"Meh. Nothing really to knock your socks off. Finally got there after waiting for all the hype to die down. Went on a Sunday night and there was a 15 minute wait which was only really about 10. Server came over quickly and took our orders. We were hungry and she brought over fries fairly quickly while we waited for our orders. She also brought over an order of garlic parm fries which were just meh. Steak fries aren't my favorite but these were ok and I liked that you could add more seasoning at the table.  The burgers were just ok. My boyfriend said he couldn't really taste anything besides the bun on his burger, and it had bleu cheese and onion straws so that's kind of a bummer. I had the siracha tavern burger and it was decent. The bun had been griddled a little too long though, it wasn't burnt, but the grease flavor was a little much. The siracha added a nice kick without being too hot. For $7, it was worth it. If I went back I wouldn't get anything but the tavern menu, everything else is overpriced.  Overall I'd rather just go to 5 guys though. Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,

10,Ea K.,"Endicott, NY",4,6,,2.0,2017-06-10,"I've been anxiously awaiting the arrival of a Red Robin in this area as we've been enjoying them out of town for years. After my recent encounter, we'll continue to frequent the out of town Red Robin's, until Vestal can get it together. I placed an online To Go order. I had the option of picking up the order ASAP with an estimated pick up time of 13 minutes. I didn't need the order that quickly, so I placed my order for pick up 45 minutes from the time of order. Essentially giving the restaurant an extra 45 minutes to make the 4 entrees. I arrived at the restaurant at the time I had set, and the order was not ready. I waited an additional 25 minutes. It appears based on the ASAP option of 13 minutes, that they didn't even start preparing the meal until I arrived for pick up. No compensation, no apologies for the wait. What's the point of giving a pick up time option if you are going to make the order when you feel like it anyways. The restaurant wasn't even that busy at the time. Food quality wise, the burgers were a little​ dry, but otherwise on par with other Red Robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vestal,,,,,
