Kitty C.,"Brea, CA",0,89,192,4.0,1/3/2018,"Solid 4 stars for their friendly customer services and average food quality. We don't come often to this location  while there are many options within the shopping mall and the area.  For the convenience,  came by Sunday evening for a family dinner. Almost seated right away as they are cleaning up the table.  Again, friendliness customer service is the key! Though we have to flag for refills and food orders. Other than that, great place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Santos C.,"Monrovia, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,We've been coming here for 20 yrs for the Chinese Chicken Salad. Just found out they removed it off their menu to add new ones. Sad to say today is our last time here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2

Service was slow ! Had to wait a good while for a drink refill and the check! The food is solid, they got quite a selection of food. If you are looking just for pizza, I'd suggest blaze! It's cheaper + it bombb.  Atmosphere is amazing, but what's atmosphere if service ain't there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  2 stars for the Pizza and it's at the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Evelina C.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",388,405,369,4.0,9/9/2017,"Don't think I've been in a California Pizza Kitchen in ages so I was game when my coworker recommended that we give this place a go!  We ordered the cauliflower bites, and the avocado egg rolls. Man were they delicious! So impressed by the cauliflower bites because I had no idea cauliflower could taste that good. Egg rolls were great as well with the dipping sauce.  I ordered the Sicilian pizza with the regular crust. It was our waiters recommendation and it was a solid 3/5 for me. I actually am an easy pizza girl and pizza Hut stuffed crust will do it for me any day!  But I was the most impressed by Jesus's service. He was so accommodating and made us feel great about our dining experience. Hats off to Jesus. We would probably come back just to have him take care of us",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Dunant H.,"San Gabriel, CA",384,133,206,3.0,7/17/2017,"This CPK is located inside of Santa Anita mall. For the most convenient parking, park outside of Macy's. CPK is located on the 2nd floor at the entrance of the ""inside"" mall right next to Macy's. The restaurant has been remodeled in recent years so it is nicer if you haven't been here in many years. I ordered a Thai chicken pizza and the pizza was just okay. Not horrible, but nothing I would want to order again. I have tried their buffalo chicken pizza at another location and would definitely recommend that one over the Thai chicken. I got my order to-go and the service was fine, the wait time was exactly what they said it would be, and they still include bread and olive oil which is nice. I won't be craving this anytime soon but if I were to ever come back, I would definitely give another dish a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Lyn N.,"West Covina, CA",231,123,198,2.0,5/12/2017,"Came here for my coworker's birthday lunch and it didn't look too busy.  We requested for a table for three and the hostess informed us that there would be a ten minute wait since they were short waiters and was waiting for one to come in. A ten minute wait didn't seem long until it became a 20 minute wait.  We looked around the restaurant and there were tons of empty tables. They should've scheduled enough waiters for a Friday lunch crowd.  Shortly after following up, the hostess seated us.  We ordered the following entrees: Kung Pao Pasta - Surprisingly tasty! If you like kung pao and pasta, definitely give it a try. You won't be disappointed. Chicken Tequila Fettucine - Never disappoints. I usually request for red pepper flakes and add it to the pasta for some kick. Garlic Fettucine: Love that it's garlicky, but could've worked on the flavor.  The portions were fairly small compared to the large portions they used to provide. I easily finished my pasta plate, whereas I used to be able to share it and still be full. And these weren't lunch portions. Oh, and I just checked my rewards and our server Kevin never inputted my code for points!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Paul S.,"San Diego, CA",261,26,42,3.0,10/17/2017,"I like this place...their pizza and pasta are good. For dinner we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, the works, chicken Alfredo and the jambalaya pasta.  The pizzas were good. The crust was crispy. Not Soggy from the sauce. Good amounts of cheese and toppings. Enough in each bite. I like the bbq sauce. Nice combination of sweet and smoky. The onions were a nice touch. And the chicken was nicely cooked. Not dry. As for the works (I apologize if it's not the name of it hehe) the toppings were fresh. The mushrooms weren't off color. The peppers and onions crispy. The pepperoni flavorful.  Pastas were cooked to a nice aldente. The Alfredo sauce was nice and creamy. Good amount of garlic mixed in. The jambalaya pasta had strong flavors. Not to much heat which was good. Sausages and other proteins were delicious.  Overall a good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Deborah L.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",3,47,170,3.0,9/16/2017,"Let me be clear. The food here tastes VERY GOOD. Cannot complain. Would give 5 stars if this review was just for the food.  On the other hand service and everything was just terrible. I dont know why maybe this mall has mostly chinese resturants like hai di lao, mei zhou dong po, ding tai fung places with really fast service that this places just seems soooooo slow but it does. I saw coming in there were plently of tables open however it took us 25 mins to get seated.  Our waiter was nice but i think i only saw her 3 times the whole entire time i was there.  The space is also very small and today there were a lot of big parties coming in and they were moving bunch of tables and chairs around and a hostess even hit me with a table she is moving which ruined my mood a bit. All the food was amazing however they forgot to put chicken on our chinese chicken salad which was really weird but they took it off our bill so i am fine with that.  Overall i will just come for the food but will not expect too much of anything else.  For the people coming to this mall i rather reccomend other chinese resturants here like ding tai fung!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2
Mary H.,"Altadena, CA",455,160,457,3.0,4/10/2017,"My family and I have been to CPK many times. This one is located near Macy's at the Santa Anita mall. The food is generally pretty good but can be expensive depending on what you order. Also the service is definitely hit-or-miss. I got the shishito peppers to start, a new dish which was super yummy but a little expensive for what you get. I believe it was $8 for a small plate. Then I got the barbecue chicken pizza with bacon. This one is always a solid choice, though I really think it could use more chicken. There were only a few pieces on the whole pizza. It was mostly barbecue sauce. But it's a classic that everyone seems to enjoy. The main issue this time around was my dad ordered the five cheese and tomato pizza and my mom got a bowl of the pea soup. When the food came my dad asked for chili flakes and my mom asked for fresh ground pepper. They waited and waited for their condiments and they never came. I'd say it was about 15 minutes. My mom had to go ask our waitress, Sam, for the condiments because the food had gotten cold. A few minutes later Sam returned with a fresh bowl of soup for my mom and offered to box up the cold one for her. She also offered to heat up my dad's pizza. She was very friendly and kind, so this was a nice redemption to the service, but it still felt a little basic of a mistake to make. Condiments should come when the food comes out.  They have some other new menu items I'd wanna try next time, like a wild mushroom strozzapreti (rolled pasta dish). Overall, a decent experience but nothing to gush over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2

S D.,"Covina, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2017,"If there was a lower rating than 1 that is what it would be.  Just went to have lunch. We specified a booth as we always do. We were waiting patiently. There 2 ladies that came in after use. They did not specify a booth as we did. But, seems like they did I know the server. I know this because I was shown the seating list. After asking why they gave them our booth. They were taken to their table, as they were being seated they realized there was a Booth being cleaned and told the servers they wanted that booth instead of the table.  My issue is this. We were next on the list and the server should not has seated them there just because they decided they wanted it. They did not specify a booth or wait extra time for the booth as I did. At this point I told the manager and managing partner Latricia.  I've been eating at this CPK for a long time. Spent hundreds of dollars there. Not anymore!!!!!

Jennifer W.,"Monrovia, CA",552,762,2384,4.0,11/11/2016,"Woah, California Pizza Kitchen inside the Santa Anita Mall had a major remodel! The open air (inside the mall) kind of helped open the space and make the restaurant feel more spacious. They did a great job to make it clean and modernized.  We haven't been to this CPK in a while, but last night we were celebrating the in-laws wedding anniversary and they wanted to come to CPK.   Sunny Side Up Pizza - 3/5 If you like breakfast foods, this is the pizza for you. They didn't really cut the slices evenly, but it was probably because they didn't want the sunny side eggs to get runny. The bacon and potato skins were crispy and delicious. If there was Tapatio, I think the fish would have been better.  Kung Pao Spaghetti - 3.5/5 We'd had this dish before and it's worth getting. The spaghetti was a little sweet and not too spicy, even had a hint of peanut butter to it. If you like Kung Pao Chicken, you will like this dish.  Spaghettini with Salmon - 3/5 When the dish came it smelled really fishy (total turn off). Once I tried a bit, the fishiness wasn't terrible, but the fish itself was on the oily and bland side.  Quinoa and Arugula Salad - 5/5  I liked this new dish the best, the toppings with the quinoa and arugula made the salad light and appetizing.  Overall the remodel makes CPK more appealing and especially when the restaurant isn't as crowded and loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2

Victoria L.,"Temple City, CA",287,134,181,2.0,10/22/2017,"Came here for lunch and had to wait 10-15 minutes for a booth..even though there were a couple of empty table booths. Our server comes by to take our drink order then is no where to be found for a while when we were ready to order. Ordered the egg rolls, BBQ chicken pizza, chicken tequila fettuccine and strawberry Italian soda. The egg rolls were really good (even though I picked out the avocado), but for almost $12, 6 halves of egg rolls seemed a bit too pricey. It comes with ranch and ranchito dipping sauce, which was great for dipping. I didn't really like that there was lots of cheese and oil though. The BBQ chicken pizza was pretty good, but there was a bit too much BBQ sauce and not much chicken. The chicken tequila fettuccine had a kick of lime to it, which is pretty good if you like a light kick of sourness in your food. What I didn't like was that the portions were small for the fettuccine, but it is enough to make you feel bloated before even finishing it. I didn't like how it tasted really heavy and also disliked the bell peppers they put in there. For beverages, I ordered the strawberry Italian soda. What was weird was that there was a small amount of what seemed to be evaporated milk to pour in. I asked our server if I was supposed to pour it in with the soda and she said yes. The Italian soda tasted pretty good with the milk, but it just didn't feel too right doing that (soda with milk? Hmm..). It was good, but it didn't make me feel so good after. Overall, the food was somewhat decent. The server forgot to bring plates and utensils. She did come back to bring extra napkins and ask if I wanted a refill, but never asked how the food was. Ended up having to take the pizza and fettuccine togo. This place was pretty pricey for the quality of food, portion size and service you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2

I really like all of their new decor, and they also serve bread with olive oil now!

Lisa B.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",19,112,95,4.0,5/31/2017,"Whenever we visit Santa Anita Fashion Park mall, we eat. There are a lot of restaurant choices here, but over the weekend, we decided to have some CPK. This is actually the CPK location we always visit whenever we are visiting the San Gabriel Valley. It not only has great service, but it's very convenient (in the mall!).  During this visit, I feel the original-hand tossed crust was much better than the last time we came a few months ago. This time it was a little thicker and chewier - nice. We ordered the Wild Mushroom pizza, Five-Cheese and Fresh Tomato pizza, and the California Veggie pizza. My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza off the Kids' Menu.  Everyone in our party agreed that the five cheese pizza was the best. It's usually a toss up every time we visit, though! The last time the Wild Mushroom was the winner. This time around, the five-cheese had more cheese on it and the tomatoes seemed fresher. We also agreed that we wouldn't try the California Veggie pizza again. There was a sweetness about it (probably from the red onions) that we didn't quite acquire a taste for. The pepperoni pizza was a hit for my little one.  Service was friendly and attentive. There were a lot of open tables when we ate there since it was during off hours. It was nice of them to let us choose a table in the location we wanted.

A S.,"Walnut, CA",387,47,26,3.0,7/6/2017,"I'm not sure why dishes at CPK never satisfy me. I've gone to this location several times and each time I visit, they manage to make mistakes on my order. That could be a reason. I'm not a picky eater and I don't make crazy requests. I usually order things as seen on the menu. So, it boggles my mind how it is possible to go wrong.  On the pizza in this picture, there was supposed to be one egg on top, not two. I thought it was clear while we were putting in the order. I'm not complaining about the extra egg and I'm grateful we didn't have to pay for it, but it's the little details that go a long way. I know it can get busy, but I urge the staff to be more attentive. If someone were allergic to something, such errors could be a life or death situation.  If you are craving quality pizza, this spot probably isn't the best place to visit.

Timothy T.,"Pasadena, CA",199,59,1,2.0,9/4/2017,"My family loves CPK but this has got to be our worst CPK experience so far.  Labor Day weekend. Monday around 615pm. The place was fairly empty. Table for 4 took about 10-15 minutes, not bad.  Sat down, waited 15 minutes for a server to come and ask for drinks/food. He took our order and said he'll bring bread and drinks right away. Took another 10 mins to get our drinks even though it was just water. Then about 5-10 minutes for bread after that.  Ordered: Chinese chicken salad, chicken tequila fettuccine, Thai pizza and the rib eye (med rare).  Food came out in the usual amount of time.  Chicken tequila fettuccine- liked the lime taste of the sauce but the chicken was dry and the fettuccine was a bit undercooked.  Rib eye- sliced this guy up and it was well done.. told the server and he said he wrote down med rare and will put in another order for us. We waited about 20 minutes for the 2nd one to come out... yet it was cooked to medium- well... forget about it. We didn't want to wait another 20 min for them to fix it so just shoved it down. It was dry and not how we usually like our steaks. Imagine how pissed Gordon Ramsay would be.. (we had the rib eye when it first came out at this location and enjoyed it very much. It was juicy and tender and we actually raved about it and craved it.) Disappointment all around this time.  Thai pizza- was pretty much COLD and dry. The sauce was non existent. Kind of feel like it was left there for a long time or if a different party ordered the wrong item and they left it there for the next party to order or something. Chinese chicken salad- to be honest and sad, this was probably the best dish we had. But again we really like the Chinese chicken salad here.  Like the first sentence said, our worst CPK experience yet. Service was slow and not how CPK usually is. The whole entire time, NO ONE came to refill our waters.

One Kung pao spaghetti, one creme penne and two garlic cream fettucines. All pastas were bland. The creme penny had very little chicken, we separated the chicken from the pasta and asked our server and he said the servings are about 3oz and it did not look like 3oz. We also asked for additional sauce in hopes that it would add more flavor but it didn't. We also added salt and pepper. Still bland.  We also had one water with a lemon and the lemon still had a sticker on it! We told our server and there was no apology. He just had someone else bring a new cup of water.

Lydia S.,"Pasadena, CA",53,44,55,3.0,7/22/2017,"This CPK has been in the Santa Anita mall for as long as I can remember (before it became Westfield), and it used to be one of the nicer places to dine at in terms of service and food quality. In recent years, however, the place has shown a steady decline across the board.  The staff turnover doesn't seem to be an issue, as you'll see familiar faces sometimes, but no one is very friendly or attentive anymore. Based on multiple visits here over the past five years, I'd say the waiters and hosts have just kept caring less and less, which likely comes back to poor management.  Food quality is alright, but the only things I'd confidently recommend here are the pizzas and desserts. The fish and meat entrées usually run the side of dry. We once ordered a ribeye that was half fat. Really felt like a ripoff.  Not sure how much longer I'll be coming to this location, especially when the mall has broadened its culinary offerings so much of late.

My high school even held fundraisers here a few times. Unfortunately, as time continued to pass, I find myself more and more reluctant in coming back. Previously, I had memories of portions shrinking with time, but prices gradually increasing. In comparison to Cheesecake Factory, I much rather go there instead. Bread here is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hard and stale, sometimes it's fresh and pretty delightful. My staple item that I order every time I come is the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. Taste and quality of the dish had thankful stayed consistent.  Regarding this experience in particular, it was the service that really had me disappointed. As we ordered, the waiter didn't seem to listen to anything I was saying. He didn't follow through with what he said he'd help us with. When he came to check on us, he didn't acknowledge the menus that have been sitting on the table, stacked and ready for him to take away. He also disregarded our empty plate of bread. He didn't bother asking if we'd like anymore, but once my mom asked him, he brought out a new plate and left the other on the side.

It may seem like a simple pizza but it's oddly filling. It's good with a heavy seasoning of red pepper flakes, and that's it-meal done. However, the rest of the table ordered other things and weren't really that satisfied by the food. Flavors for the their dishes (mushroom pasta and carne asada pizza) were average.

This made my view a room full of dirty dishes. The hostess apologized for the dirty table and cleaned it while we were seated. 3. Our server didn't bring my wife her coke drink until we were halfway done with our meal.. And after we reminded them. 4. They brought us someone else's drinks without verifying they were ours. We sent them back. 5. They brought us someone else's dessert .. which we had to send back as well. 6. They brought the table next to us their appetizer bread late... when they were already 3/4 done with their entree. 7. They brought me my Chinese Chicken Salad when I was halfway done with eating my wife's pizza & our spinach artichoke dip. 8. The Chinese Chicken Salad had brown pieces of Salad which did not look fresh. I still ate it since I did not want to complain. (I saved all my complaints for all of you! ) Overall, this is not a place which I would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=20

That wasn't even the reason for this review though. I needed just some SIMPLE balsamic vinaigrette...since our server is taking WAY too long, we tried asking another server, not once, twice...Three times! She didn't even give us the courtesy of saying anything. the second and third time she DIRECTLY looked at me, gave me a dirty ass look, and proceeded to ignore me.

We ordered a free appetizer flatbread pizza which our waiter highly suggested and it was crispy and delicious.  My sister signed up for their email and get a free appetizer.   I ordered chicken piccata and my sister ordered a Italian pizza and both items were flavorful.  My sister ordered a salad and it was huge in size. We didn't wait too long for the food to arrive which was nice.  Anyway, the place was quite busy on a Friday night.  Our waiter was very good on refill on water and soda.

It tastes identical to any other buffalo wings but the greens on top is a nice addition. The arugula salad was good, the peanuts give it a nice nutty flavor with an addition of crunch. The Crispy Mac n cheese is a must have. As heavy as it sounds it's a nice fulfilling appetizer to have. The pesto creme penne is a go to if u want something a little more hearty, i usually add chicken for a source of protein and it blends in with the dish very well.

David L.,"Arcadia, CA",188,183,68,3.0,7/12/2015,"Located at the Santa Anita Mall upstairs by Macy's. Good luck finding parking during mall rush hours, best bet is to park by Nordstrom's past the underground parking structures.  During Lunch and Dinner hours, this place can get pretty full. Best bet is to avoid dining in and getting it as takeout as nobody really does takeout... also you don't have to tip.  The food here is pretty good, however it is higher in price for a smaller portion. Their ""small plates"" are more of appetizers. I ordered the Mac and Cheese small plate thinking it would come in a small plate as the title would suggest, but I just got 4 fried mac and cheese shaped like chicken nuggets. For $7 that's pretty outrageous. Also, it wasn't even that great, it was fairly dry, and lacked the mac n' cheese flavor. The main course was more flavorful, and it came in a decent sized portion, however for the price I would've expected a little more.  Their deserts however, does not compare to Cheesecake Factory. I got the Key Lime Pie and hated it. It was more bitter than sour. It was pretty hard to eat. If you were planing to get desert, get it somewhere else like Cheesecake Factory which is also located at the mall.  Overall, this place is decent, however their food portions could be better, as well as the seasoning of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=60

The bok choy and faro were drenched in the ginger sauce to the point where they were wet, soggy, and difficult to cut with a knife. Flavors are very sweet to the point where you are not going to want dessert. The chicken was dry, but I guess that is what all the sauce is for. The Buffalo Cauliflower was burnt. Yes, incredibly overcooked as were the Thai Egg Rolls. Lots of black char on the food to increase my chances for prostate and stomach cancer.

Overall a nice place for a relatively quick bite. Our server was very attentive and quick. COMPLEMENTARY BREAD: wow, it's been a while since I've been to any CPK; the last time I was here they gave us regular bread (not toasted) with butter. Now, they toast the bread slices and give us a side of olive oil to dip. GRILLED CHICKEN CAESAR SANDWICH: A sandwich composed of grilled chicken, Caesar salad dressing, parmesan shavings, lettuce, and tomatoes on a parmesan herb cibatta bun. Comes with either a cup of soup or Caesar salad. I opted for the salad. Best deal for lunch IMO, not too much where you take any leftovers but enough so that it fills you up. PESTO CREAM PENNE W/ CHICKEN: Pretty good but not worth the extra $3 for the chicken. There were maybe 3-4 tiny pathetic pieces of chicken in there at most. Pesto flavor was a little too light. Would not recommend. ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD: Great salad option, got a half portion. Consists of lettuce, chicken, BBQ sauce, ranch, chopped tomatoes, and corn chips.

It's only $9.95 for a half portion of each. There's a lot of other options too, and the price is great.  The chicken milanese is another favorite of mine. It's 3 chicken breasts on top of arugula and covered by Parmesan thin squares. Very delicious.  I almost always cave and order the crispy Mac & Cheese as an appetizer. It's 4 balls that 2in x 2in and taste of pure goodness.  The taste of the food is consistent across all locations and funny enough so is the service.

Our waiter Alfonoso was very attentive, made great recommendations, and really went out of his way to ensure we had a great experience! Spicy fennel sausage + poblano served on flatbread is a delicious small plate! Hand torn sausage, poblano and light cheese over flatbread. The poblano pepper slices are not very spicy and add a nice little kick to it. Great appetizer for a small group of four. Roasted garlic chicken pizza is my all time favorite! I think they removed this item from the menu a few years ago but it might be back as a seasonal item. Roasted garlic and sweet Caramelized onions add great flavor to this dish. I really hope they decide to bring this item back to the menu or at least bring it around more often! Can't go wrong with this pizza!!! Shrimp scampi with zucchini has an ample amount of zucchini in it! Don't forget to have them grate some fresh Parmesan over it! The shrimp is fresh and there are garlic bits on it which taste delicious! Farmers Market Soup is another newer item I haven't tried. If you like butternut bisque this is a top choice of mine. Roasted squash and corn with a touch of cream. It's not too rich and has a nice light flavor. Cobb salad is pretty standard. A good choice if you like bacon!

The Margherita thin crust pizza balances good mozzarella, diced tomatoes, and fresh basil on a soft thin crust, not crunchy and crumbly like other places' thin crust pizzas. On our most recent trip, we ordered the Thai spring rolls, a chicken bbq salad, and the pizza. Everything was just fine.   Warm bread was brought to the table with olive oil, and requested balsamic vinegar for dipping. Waters and iced tea were perpetually filled by ninja wait staff without disrupting table conversation. Awesome servers at CPK!!!

Spicy, a bit oily, with plenty of shrimp and chicken. Pasta done al dente. Artichoke and spinach pizza with chicken, thin crust: better than most spinach and artichoke dips that have too much cheese.

Cindy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",503,181,677,4.0,5/28/2015,"Haven't been to CPK in a while but it has definitely improved by a lot since I've last been here! They added lots of different options to the menu now, like salmon, ribeye, tacos, etc. Of course, pizza is the best to get here but the other dishes are above average too. We got the shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread, my favorite appetizer here! If you register for rewards (just by putting down your email), I think you can get this menu item for free. Saladwise, I've always liked the California Cobb salad. Soups aren't really my thing here.  For pizzas, you can't go wrong with the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, always my favorite one. My sister likes the Hawaiian pizza but since no one wanted to share with her, she got a kid's size. Don't forget that you can get a kid's size if you want a smaller portion of something! They have a kid's menu available separately. And I also really like the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza. You have to add some money but I think it's worth it if you get your pizzas with a thin crust. The only thing I was annoyed about was that they didn't cut the pizza evenly, one part was WAY too large and one part was way too small, so we kind of had to recut it ourselves. If you're feeling like pasta, I love the kung pao spaghetti! The chicken tequila fettuccine comes in second for my favorite pastas here. I tried the halibut last time (a new menu item) and it was delicious!! Was really surprised that as a pizza restaurant, they excel in seafood as well! Honestly, anything you order will probably be good. I haven't tried anything I hated or that I didn't like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=40
Sandy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",566,500,7270,3.0,3/26/2016,"Whenever it's lunch or dinner time and you know all the other restaurants at the mall are going to be packed full of people, CPK is a great option where, yes, there maybe still a wait, but heck it's not going to be as long as the line at the Cheesecake Factory OR Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill. It's located on the 2nd level floor of the mall (near Macy's) and the outside promenade doorway (facing All That Barbecue KBBQ) and when you walk up, try to find the hostess as soon as you can to get your name down on the seating list. Usually the hostess is inside to greet you, but when it gets super busy, there is also a outside hostess already taking a list of names outside. There are 3 primary seating areas: 1) inside, 2) outside in the outside promenade area & 3) outside of the restaurant inside the mall. Service here has always been pleasantly good for me. Sometimes I get an experienced server and sometimes a newbie one, but majority of the time, they're attentive and quick to bring out your food orders. Food here has always been good since I always stick with the classics and you can't go wrong with that! Bread here is nice and soft with either a choice of olive oil dip or butter.

Ariel T.,"Duarte, CA",71,31,6,2.0,11/6/2016,"The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the chick who came down to deliver our ""curbside service"" was gracious and apologetic. She handled the situation very professionally and in a competent, polished manner.  Basically, we ordered two pizzas, charged for two pizzas, and given a large bag being told, ""Here are your two pizzas."" We took off and I realized we were only given one pizza and the toppings that were supposed to go on the pizza we were missing. No big deal.. it's an honest mistake. I wasn't or hadn't been upset until I called back curbside to inform them.  I was immediately transferred to ""take out"" and spoke to this horribly obnoxious girl. She picked up the line asking the usual ""how can I help you..."" and when I started to explain the situation she abruptly interrupts what I'm saying and starts talking over me: ""yeah we know okay, we just sent the girl back she's new so she forgot it."" Um okay? That was my response. Um okay...? I get a condescending sorry from her and I then explained that my annoyance was not with the new employee she's throwing under the bus, but with her cutting me off and speaking to me with an attitude. She responded with yet another condescending apology. I hung up. I can't deal with incompetent employees who are brave over the phone.  The chick that brought the pizza the first time came back and was apologetic. I told her it was no big deal and we drove off. That's it. That's all it had to be. We could've ended it there, but her coworker decided to give us her horrendous attitude. And by the way... it is inexcusable and completely unprofessional to throw another employee under the bus to take the blame off of yourself. Even if it was the ""runners"" responsibility to assemble the complete order, this girl on the phone was incredibly rude to a customer who didn't see the situation as a big deal until she opened her mouth. Now she's earned a two star review for CPK and a zero star review for herself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=40
Jerry Y.,"Arcadia, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/11/2017,"I have been to the location by Macy's in Santa Anita Mall many times. I am not much of a pizza person but do love their steak. Must have been there a dozen times for steak and even brought friends there to introduce them to this special find. Who would have guess that a pizza place serve such good steak. Was really disappointed today. Arrived at about 5 pm and ordered steak. They only serve one type of steak. The steak that was served was on the brink of turning bad.  Does not smell good, does not taste good... just blah. I returned it and the waitress ordered me another one, medium like before. She was very nice and hospitable. Waited 10 minutes and another steak came. This time, it was good. smells nice like a steak should. I cut into the corner and tried the steak. The flavor was outstanding. I then cut into the middle of the steak and it was not cooked. It was not even rare. I was NOT happy. The waitress saw the cut open steak, apologized and took it away. She ask if she could get me something else but I have had enough for one afternoon.  TO CPK MANAGEMENT: Your waitress was very nice and polite. I gave her a $10 tip before I walked out.  You guys have to manage your kitchen staff. All you need is one rotten apple to mess up your image.

Kristine W.,"Arcadia, CA",266,65,36,3.0,10/2/2017,Seated really quickly on a Saturday night but the rest of the service was really slow. Waited over 40 mins to get our food. Asked for bread and it came out so hard I only ate the insides. Weird because it was also warm. Reheated after being stale maybe ? Also asked for vinegar to put in our olive oil. Waiter forgot about it but he apologized and brought it out after we almost finished the bread. Ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini substituted fettuccini with penne Because I love penne. Ordered this a while ago and it was much better before. There was a lack of sauce on my pasta which made it kind of meh but pasta was cooked perfectly. Waiter also never refilled my water even though he was holding a water thing when bringing me extra lemons for my pasta. I didn't ask because I thought he was going to refill it when I saw him holding it.... but I guess it's still my fault for not asking. Wouldn't come here again kinda pricey for what it is pasta ended up being around 19$ with tax and tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=40
Cindy L.,"Monterey Park, CA",155,294,413,4.0,2/15/2015,"Stuck between a three and four star for overall experience here, but I rounded up for old times sake. I used to really love California Pizza Kitchen, but my most recent visit just wasn't as pleasant as the rest. I'm thinking it was because Valentine's Day rush really slowed everything down. The boyfriend had work until the evening, and he chose  this place for our simple dinner together. We didn't know that there was a Valentine Day's special (from the Feb. 11th-15th) but we decided to throw in a couple more bucks and go with it since we wanted an appetizer and two entrees anyways. The special was: appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts for a total of ~$32 (without tax or tip).  There was a long wait, and I expected that at the time we were going. It was difficult to find parking and the estimated wait time was longer than provided though the hostesses were very nice and cheerful. We were starving and got Potato Corner while we waited. In the end, the total wait time was about 40 minutes. SERVICE I want to emphasize that our waiter was a really nice guy. He stopped by our table several times to check if we were okay, and we were. He apologized for our wait (for the table and food) since they are busy in the back, which completely makes sense since there were still people crowded around in front waiting for a table. FOOD/ DRINKS In terms of food, I just went home unsatisfied. I was full, but I didn't really enjoy the food. For drinks, I got the Fresh Mango Cooler, which tasted sweet and sour with a hint of mint and soda. The boy got his beloved Fresh Strawberry Lemonade and we had no complaints there.  For food, we ordered the Spinach Dipped Artichoke appetizer, Garlic Cream Fettuccine and The Original Hand Tossed Hawaiian Pizza entree, and Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The pasta, which I think I normally like, was lukewarm and a little dry - much different than what I had before. Hawaiian Pizza was not what I expected - much more plain than I remember. I only recall tasting ham and pineapple toppings on the pizza and either just didn't taste as fresh or hot. What I enjoyed most was our appetizer which came pippin' hot and delicious and arrived two minutes before the entrees.  I can overlook the time and wait for the table and food since I get that it was really busy and it was difficult to accommodate everyone, but I wish the quality of the food was worth the wait.  Almost $50 for a meal and it just wasn't that good this time. Sadly, I probably won't come back for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=80

Paul N.,"Temple City, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/22/2017,"have been coming here for many years, but the quality of the pizza and service have definitely gone down during our visit on 2/19/17 around 6pm.  We ordered our usual Margherita thin crust pizza and it was terrible.  It was just a plain cheese pizza with some tomato paste on the edge and not a single piece of tomato on the pizza for about $14.  I asked the woman manager about it, and she simply said it's basically a cheese pizza.  Sadly, it wasn't even that good of a plain cheese pizza. We sat at the bar and the service, or lack of it, was terrible. The bartender said she'd bring us some bread when she took our order.  No bread for about 10 min. then she came back to ask if we want some bread.  She never ask how the food was or if we need more water.  And there was a total of 4 customers sitting at the bar so not sure if she was new or just a training issue.

I ordered a chicken plate and this was usually my go to, but it was terrible. They were so stingy with the vegetables and for the price I'm paying for this dish I would've hoped it would be prepared better. The last time we went was maybe a couple weeks ago and it was even worse. The waiter barely came by, we were seated and he came then never showed up until we called him. Once we ordered it took 45 minutes for the food to come, I'm not exaggerating. The food came and my dish was out last, which was surprising because I ordered a salad.

Me and my boyfriend got a gift card as a Christmas gift so of course we're going to use it. If we didn't have this gift card we probably would never come. Honestly, I'm glad we did because they upgraded a lot of their stuff here. The menu and the quality of the food definitely exceeded my expectations.  Service was super friendly and helpful. She always refilled our water cups when they were empty.  The free bread they give you as an appetizer tastes sooo much better now. In the past, they used to serve their bread cold, hard and with butter. Now they have a different type of bread that's bigger in size, fresh when it comes out, and with an olive oil sauce.  My boyfriend got the jambalaya and he said it was okay. It was a little heavy, but I think that's suppose to be a good thing. He just doesn't eat that much I got their arugula and asparagus small plate salad. It was delicious. I'm a big fan of arugula so I really enjoyed this dish. It also comes with shaved Parmesan cheese and almonds. This is a must get if you want an appetizer.  I also got the kung pao noodles. I liked this dish as well. It's not spicy like it says it is, but it has a really nice flavor to it. It might seem a little dry and lacking in sauce, but there was more sauce on the bottom and just mixed everything up.

We had to ask him for a bigger table with a little more space for our goodies.  We ordered: --Asparagus and spinach spaghettini with salmon was good; however, they were a little cheap with the toppings (asparagus, spinach and salmon).  There were a lot of noodles and not enough toppings. Looks like the chef took two spears of asparagus and chopped it up in small pieces, couple of spinach leaves and one ounce of salmon and placed it on top of the noodles. Not enough protein for one person. --Spinach and artichoke pizza was dry and tough. Again, not enough toppings just like the other dish. --Mango iced tea was refreshing and not too sweet. Yes to free refills. Service, overall, was good. Our server checked on us couple of times and kept my drinks full and even boxed my leftovers for me instead of handing me the boxes.

Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,4.0,1/4/2014,"Came by here on New Year's day for lunch with my mother and my husband since we were hungry while scoring some excellent new year sales deals. We walked up to the hostess desk/ podium a little before 12 pm and were seated immediately inside the restaurant (there is tables outside of the restaurant you can sit at).  This is what we ordered: Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($9.49 prior to tax)- this appetizer came out pretty quickly actually, which was nice because we were quite hungry and the complementary bread just wasn't enough. The chicken mixture was really good and wasn't too greasy. The lettuce we got were only 5 pieces and wasn't sure if we had to pay extra for more so we didn't bother to ask. But it would have been nice to have a few more lettuce pieces.  Caramelized Peach Salad (full size $11.99 prior to tax)- I added salmon to this salad ($4.59, prior to tax, extra for that) to give this salad a bit more substance and protein. This salad was really good because of the flavors all mixed in with every bite. The caramelized peaches added a bit of sweetness and the feta cheese added a bit of saltiness. But I think there was a bit too much feta cheese though (I'm not really a big fan of feta cheese, or really any cheese added to my salad in general... I really like melted cheese in a sandwich more). The dressing was nice and light. I loved the dried cranberries and pecans added to this salad as well. It was also great that this salad was made with the dark green leafys instead of that cheap iceberg lettuce. I would have preferred the red onions to have been caramelized instead of eating them raw.  California Club Pizza ($13.29 prior to tax)- When I saw this pizza brought to this table, I thought it was just a salad placed on top of pizza crust and didn't think this was going to be a good pizza (my husband picked this dish). But I was surprised that I actually liked it. There is a little bit of bacon on the very bottom of the crust which gives it a saltiness and added crunchy texture. The tomatoes and dressing with the lettuce on top of the pizza crust was really tasty. I also liked the creaminess of the avocado pieces as well.  As soon as our server greeted us, she immediately brought over a plate of complementary bread slices with an olive oil dip. It was good, but sadly only came with 4 pieces.  Our server was very friendly and pretty good at refilling our drinks most of the time during our dining experience. She was helpful in answering our questions about the menu as well. Overall, the food was pretty good. I was a little apprehensive to eat here though because of the yelp reviews. The last time I came here was over 10+ years ago (when I was still in high school...yea, I'm totally old) and I thought the food was good. So I was happy to see that this place still is just as good as it was back then and wouldn't mind coming back here again for lunch with the family.  By the way, CPK is located on the 2nd floor, close to Macy's, in case you are looking for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=100

Staffs are friendly and they even gived me free small dish for signing up as member :) We ordered Thai Chicken pizza with thin crust (laying off the carbs lol).

It's a wonderful open concept layout and not only has their location improved but the staff and food quality as well! I've always been a CPK person, the Sicilian pizza is my favorite to date... but as I've gotten older I've found other pizza places that I like better just because of convenience and price wise. I feel like the service kind of went stale after a few years so I did stop coming. But after yesterday, my views have changed and I can say I'm a believer again! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful server and of course ordered a Sicilian Pizza and their chicken Cesar salad. ( Tip: The half order of their salads is the perfect amount for two people ). The server also brought us complimentary bread without hesitation and also threw in a free guacamole and chips for an appetizer as thank you for returning ! Totally unexpected and so sweet, a lot of chain restaurants I feel have lost their touch when it comes to making the experience personalized however I really feel like CPK knocked it out of the park.

Aron K.,"Pasadena, CA",12,14,63,3.0,9/14/2014,"We went to this CPK today.  We ordered 2 pizzas (tostada thin crust pizza & works original pizza) and one dessert for a total of $50. Here are some things we experienced: It took almost 45 minutes from the time our order was taken until we received the pizzas. Bread started did not come until 30 mins from the time our order was taken.  The first thing we noticed was that the wall at our seat does not seem to be cleaned for a long time. It was quite dusty (see picture). Once the bread started came, it was mediocre at best: does not look like it was fresh from the oven and the olive oil dressing was bland..... meh.... it's free! who am I to complain.  =D Then the Pizzas came. The tostada thin crust pizza was burnt (mostly at the bottom and a little bit on the side) to the point that it was bitter. It was probably baked too close to the fire. The black bean paste was too little for our taste. It was quite tasty, though.  The work pizza was baked perfectly. However, the taste was mediocre for a $15 pizza. It taste the same like a $8 pizza I can get from my school cafeteria.  The dessert: We decided to try their new dessert: Salted Caramel Pudding.  It was nice. The sweet taste balance the saltiness of the salt. I did not like the ""black cocoa cookie crumbs"" at the bottom. Caramel was too weak. The mousse taste like a store-bought product.  The only reason we did not give it 2-stars rating is because our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Note:  at the end, my wife saw that one of the 'order ticket' fell onto one of the pizza on the kitchen counter. Then, one of the server just picked it up and continue to serve that pizza.  I know that this may not be a big deal for some people. However, if you dare to showcase your kitchen to the customer, you'd better make sure that this kind of thing does not happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=100
Jenny N.,"San Diego, CA",519,377,150,4.0,1/6/2015,"CPK would be a place I crave for at times when I really want their Tiramisu, Original BBQ Chopped Salad or their Bbq pizza. I thought their food is great, there's never one time I was dissatisfied with the dishes I ordered. I do have to agree at times that their services may be a bit slow and it's difficult to find your server at times, but other than that, when you do get your server's attention, they really accomodate and help you out.  I really think CPK have the best Tiramisu. Something about it that just kept me coming. You can really taste the rum in the Tiramisu as well. So it's wonderful. My girlfriend and I would celebrate our birthdays here together just for the Tiramisu.  I do though, dislike the California pizza where there's only avocado, lettuce and mayo all over the pizza. That was just a bit different. Not my kind of pizza. If you LOVE LOVE Avocado and don't want any meat on your pizza, I guess the California pizza is the way to go.  Their Kung-Pao Spaghetti is also pretty good. Who would of guessed Kung-Pao chicken with spaghetti would be such a great combo. If you feel like eating Chinese mixed with some Italian style noodles, just go with Kung-Pao Spaghetti, can't really go wrong with the name ""Kung pao "" right? The Jambalaya at CPK is also pretty decent. I still prefer getting Jambalaya at Cheesecake Factory though.

I was very impressed.  All the food was freshly made and hot coming out.  We ordered a thin crusted pizza, the two soups in a bowl, mac and cheese balls and chinese chicken salad.  The Chinese chicken salad was not that great, mainly because the dressing is hoisin sauce based, but other than that all the good was delicious.   The service at this location was also very on point - very attentive; they asked how our meal was and promptly refilled our drinks.  I also did not ever feel rushed or pressured to buy their movie ticket offer.  All in all, a good experience.  CPK in general will never be a first option for me, but I'm glad to say I'm not completely turned off by it anymore and this is a very good location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=180

I wasn't bold enough to ask.. but reading other reviews, it seems like you do have to ask to get the free bread now. (Minus one star.)  The food that we ordered- quinoa salad and pear gorgonzola thin crust. The quinoa salad is a new item on the menu, it was good! My mom and I both liked the pairing of the ingredients and the flavor of it. If you have tried the quinoa salad from Costco, this one is just as good if not better with the feta cheese, sundried tomatoes, asparagus, and pine nuts! The portion is small though.  The pear gorgonzola thin crust was average. The crust itself was crunchy on the edge and chewy in the center. It was alright.. The amount of pear and gorgonzola they used is just ridiculously little. There were a total of 7 thinly sliced pears over the whole pizza. The gorgonzola was almost non-existent. I had to dig through the pile of greens in the middle to point out the gorgonzola to my mom. The caramelized onions on the pizza stood out and sort of made up for the lack of pear and gorgonzola!

Tiffany T.,"Arcadia, CA",1096,427,288,4.0,1/30/2012,"California Pizza Kitchen has been in the Santa Anita mall ever since I could remember the awkward middle school years when we still had Limited Too and Photobunch. And despite the many years that have passed, one thing that has stayed timelessly good has been Arcadia's CPK.  Personally, my favorite pizzas are the Pepperoni, Mushroom + Sausage and the Wild Mushroom pizza. The pizzas aren't really big, with about 6 smallish-medium slices. I generally find that the size is perfect for sharing. The crust is thin, slightly crispy and sweet, which sets the pizza apart from its other greasier counterparts.  Waldorf Chicken Salad is also delicious! Fresh spinach, arugula, red cabbage, celery, chopped walnuts, apple slices, grapes and grilled chicken gives this salad a unique, fresh twist on your typical salad. It's topped with either blue cheese or balsamic vinegar, making it healthier than a lot of other salads. CPK are geniuses for bringing this sophisticated salad, which originates from New York, into their menu. But I'm not too big on the other dishes. I've had the fish tacos here before but they weren't really memorable. My family happens to like the fettucini, as that is a pretty popular dish among those who don't feeling like having pizza.  The prices aren't unreasonable with pizzas costing around $15, but the dishes will cost more than other pizza joints and you'd get a smaller quantity. But hey, CPK is such a central part of the mall that you can't help wandering in every now and then with a craving for some ""gourmet"" pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=180

One thing I don't like is that the blue cheese dressing is a little too heavy for me. Asparagus and arugula salad - This salad portion is just right. I love the cheese they have on top, but if you're not a fan of cheese... it could be a little too much. Crispy mac n cheese - The mac n cheese is really ""cheesy"", so I love it. The portion is also just right for my cheese craving. Caramelized peach salad - I've ordered this salad bijillion times and I never got tired of it! I normally hate salad that I feel like a sheep chewing on grass..., but along with peaches and roasted pecans, this salad is one of my favorite at cpk. Pizzas - I've tried almost all of CPK's pizzas. My two favorites are Hawaiian and California club. I like Hawaiian on thin crust because you would want to taste the pineapple, ham and tomato sauce all at once, but California club is better on hand-tossed original because it has so many different (and yummy) ingredients that only a thick crust can carry all those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=180

Smaller sized restaurant but consistently great customer service, and always a small wait time. They were PACKED Sunday around 1:30p, but we were seated within 5min. They were giving free small appetizers if you signed up for their free rewards program (collect points, get money off when you  reach certain amount of points) which was quick and easy, got our free guacamole and chips which was delicious. Guacamole was very fresh and flavorful. Our waitress was VERY busy but still very attentive. She came by 2 or 3 times to ask how the food was, refilled our drinks and brought out bread a couple times too. She may have been overwhelmed by all of the tables, confusing us with other tables bringing boxes or appetizers to the wrong table, but she was very sweet and sincere about it so it wasn't a big deal. Plus, she was working her butt off on a busy day. Only negative here is their prices. I've seen them steadily increase over the past couple years, and I think they're pretty ridiculous now. I remember when their individual pizza's were 11-12 bucks. Now almost all of the pizzas are close to $15, and not one of the salads were below $13.

I have to say that I am seriously not a big fan of corporate restaurants.  Most of the time foods at corporate places are all frozen and the air smells of misery and minimum wage.  But you know what?  CPK employees ACTUALLY SMILE!  That's so rare because at most times, employees use their portray how they feel during working.  It's as if CPK employees are programmed with binary codes to produce happy feelings.  Or what if they actually are happy there? CPK is the same at most places, but I tend to love this location in Arcadia.  It is slightly overpriced and they have gone through quite a few changes since the other times I have been here.  Some examples are: - Bread is different than before.  It has more of a Mediterranean taste with olive oil and spices than with butter. - There are bottles of sparkling water on the side. - Pizza and food are always changing here.  Two of my favorite pizzas, Shrimp Scampi and Mango Tendori, are now gone forever.  I also forgot to mention the Singaporean Spring rolls. - Atmosphere has somehow changed and is slightly less Chaotic than it was before. Regardless of the changes, the food is always surprisingly consistent and great.  I especially love their mushroom pizzas.  The Kung Pao Spaghetti is an excellent addition as well.  There are other small bites and what not but I'll leave that for you to decide :) Tips: -Parking is easy. -It gets super busy during weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=160

Or maybe it's because I've had the same variety at YardHouse and they knock it out of the park. either way, it was very bland, had hardly any vegetables, and they were not liberal at all with the peanut dressing.

Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",640,502,122,4.0,8/13/2013,"Typical chain restaurant -- but I'm determined to write a review since I've checked in here. Lunch portions are always better here, just because it's a little cheaper. The food here is pretty delicious, but is probably more on the pricy end for me. Good appetizers in my opinion, would be the avocado rolls -- although it's not a huge portion. So boo to that. For entrees, I usually enjoy the Thai Chicken Pizza -- it's such a unique pizza, that only CPK would be carrying it. For pastas, I like the Tequila Chicken Fettucine, it's just simply amazing with the creaminess and a hint of lime, making this dish not too overbearing with the creaminess. On top of that, you can definitely taste the freshness of the olive oil (as weird as that may sound).  Service here is always amazing. I don't think I've ever had a bad waiter/waitress. In fact, one time I was so hesitant on trying a dish, the waitress told me if I didn't enjoy it that I can always exchange for a different item. HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! Overall, I love it here. I normally don't like pizza, but this place always has a pizza my heart (get it? haha). I would definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza! Turn Ons: - Great food & service. Turn Offs: - Pricing -- it's not the cheapest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=200

So the complimentary bread they used to give comes with butter right?  Well... I guess everyone is trying to go the healthier route... bread came with a side of olive oil and herbs.  Still yummy, but I kinda missed the butter...  at the waiting area they displayed a new Chickenpox Tequila Fettuccine, looked soooo good, had to try it!  BF on the other hand LOVES Pizza!  He got the Wild Mushroom pizza with Truffle Oil. We shared the Asparagus + Arugula Salad (SM Plate) The salad was our favorite of the night!  That's saying something...  Lightly dressed, clean and fresh, sundried tomatoes were tart and flavorful, with the combination of the lemon vinaigrette, almond and parmesan cheese, this salad we divine! The mushroom pizza came out looking dry... only because the truffle oil was served on the side.. WTF REALLY!? Ok.....?? Normally the chef would brush on the truffle oil so the pizza is evenly coated... Pshhh.... mushroom tasted great, like fresh produce good. Pizza dough was flat but not flat bread, and it felt like it need higher heat in the oven because the dough was under soft and flimsy Pasta, great flavors, but pasta texture not so much... didn't feel like fresh pasta, felt like expired pasta, not sure how to explain it... no boing?

Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,1.0,2/26/2013,"Despite me coming here more often than I'd like to, I really really really dislike CPK, especially this location. If it weren't for my best friend Jessica C., who loves this place to pieces, and the occasional family member who wants to dine here as it's nearby, I would never visit. I've been here more times than I can remember since the restaurant has been around for ages, dating back to my primary school years. CPK has always been a mediocre chain restaurant to dine in if there were no better options because at least, the food is consistent. However, considering the past couple of times I've eaten here, I really wish it'd close for something better to move in. Service is absolutely terrible. Yeah, I get that it's CPK and quality service isn't expected but I still do have some standards. During one of my most recent visits on a weekend night, it was no surprise the restaurant was busy. The wait was about 30-40 minutes long, but the host said it'd be okay if we left our number and walked around the mall. He reassured me he would call us when our table was ready. We walked around the mall for a bit and ended at Brookstone's, spending the rest of our remaining waiting time in glorious massage chairs. Twenty minutes passed... Thirty minutes passed... We then realized it'd been well over an hour, and still no phone call. We decided to stay in the chairs for a bit longer and eventually went back 90 minutes after we had left our number with the host. The restaurant was empty, as it was already around 9:30 pm, yet we never received a call. We told a different host what happened and the only thing he did was quickly apologize and seat us. I'm sorry, you just wasted an hour of our time, and the only thing we get is an insincere apology? During another recent visit, after the incident above, they really put my patience to the test. Going in on a weeknight, the restaurant was practically empty. Yet the host refused to seat us because ""the restaurant was behind"". I told the host I understood, but asked if we could we at least be seated. He dumbly repeated that the restaurant was behind. While we waited, we discussed leaving and going to another restaurant, and miraculously, we were seated in one of the many open tables. Our server Jassmine, was just as annoying. While things started decently at first, the later it got, the worse it became. She only came up to us twice during our meal to check on us and never offered to refill our drinks; we always had to ask. When we asked for chopsticks for the Kung Pao pasta, she forgot and never brought them; my mom actually got up and went looking for some, until another server asked if she needed help. For most of the meal, Jassmine was off walking around, handholding (yeah idk), and chatting with other servers. It wasn't until a manager noticed, that she stopped talking -- yet, she never came to check on us. I get it's a slow night, but that doesn't excuse why there are empty dishes and empty glasses on our table. Are we supposed to refill our water ourselves too? There's not much they can do to rectify what happened as it's already in the past, so it's safe to say I'm going to make it a point to never come here again. I don't care how badly any of my friends or family members want to dine here, I refuse to step another foot into this location.

What was strange when we got seated was that the plates and utensils weren't set up in the seating arrangements--they were just in stack on one side of the table. Most restaurants I've been to have a plate and utensil set at each seat. Also, there were more plates and utensils at our table than the amount of people in our party. The food we ordered took a really long time to come out--at least 30 minutes. During that time, we didn't see the waiter at all. Actually, during the whole meal, we barely saw the waiter. I felt we didn't get much attention; I don't know if it's because the place might have been understaffed or the waiters were spending more time on the ""wealthy"" Asian families that were there. The food wasn't bad nor was it impressive.

I've had better, fresher pizzas before.  Also, about the service. I think that waiters are pretty good here. However, if you try to find another waiter who isn't attending to your table and they SEE you trying to get their attention, they will do NOTHING about it. They wouldn't even tell my main waiter that I needed something. I understand the whole one waiter assigned to a set of tables stuff, but I mean you could at least let my waiter know.

IYelpFor U.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,91,74,2.0,7/6/2012,"CPK used to be good, but it is not worth the money these days. Their pizzas are known to be sweet and small, and if you've ever had pizzas from places like Avanti, or even from an authentic Italian joint like 'Charlie's Trio' then CPK is considered nothing more than just a quick fix. I can't speak for everything else on their menu but I can definitely chime in for the pastas -- and sorry to say but they just plain ol' sucked! I've had them in Vegas, then back home in the Pasadena location, and finally, this location and they're all consistently sub-par. A friend bought me some take-out (Jambalaya) from this kitchen and it was the biggest turn off from beginning to end. First off, whoever prepared the dish made it with Fettuccine...(wtf?)...instead of Linguine, even though the original from the menu (which I've had three times in the past) was Linguine. I was furious as hell when I opened the tray at home. Somehow, the food also tasted extremely bland and at the same time packed with lots and LOTS of sodium! The only thing my palette picked up was cumin, and the dish was lacking many of the essential spices that needed to make a great Jambalaya.  The thing that got me most was how they packed the two slices of bread along with the little butter packets; as I wasn't thinking anymore since the dish was so screwed up that when I peeled opened the butter it has completely melted to a watery state and dripped all over the place. Thanks to the idiot who: 1. Made the awful 'fettuccine' Jambalaya instead of with linguine, 2. Put the cold butter on top of the hot take out!  ....and for this, CPK is an epic fail!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=240

The waitress that we had in the beginning she was very attentive, then a man came and requested for her to be his waitress and she just totally forgot about us. I had to ask another waitress to get our refills and everything else. Then our original waitress notices that we were close to being done and gives us our check, I told her that it's my birthday month and so I would like my free dessert and she was like wait I have to check your rewards. I had also asked for her to pack our leftovers. She comes back and says yes that I do have a free dessert. So 2 other waitresses brings it out and asks everyone if the desert belonged to then and never gave it to me. They went back inside to ask my original waitress and then one of the lady brings it out and asks if I ordered it and I said yes. She then tells me o she was gonna give it away (in a mean way) since she didn't know who it was for. So when we finished and I paid, the waitress never brought me back my leftovers (packed) so I had to ask her, mind you, most of the time she was tending to that man that requested for her and he was just sitting behind me. They were big time flirting too and being touchy. How professional is that! Anyhow, she was clueless about what I was talking about then she was like omg, I forgot! DUH!

When he finally decided to bring us bread I asked for the plate and of course he forgot. Not until right before our food was brought out did I get my plate.

The california club on the other hand had so much greens on it that the flavor of it was really more of a ""salad with bread"" than a pizza with salad on top.  One thing that I didn't like was the fact that we didn't get small bread with oil. It was weird because we swore that they gave it before so we didn't really ask. But then we noticed that all of the servers were asking the new patrons if they wanted bread which we obviously didn't get asked and we obviously didn't have any plate on our table for us to snack on before the main meal came. This made us feel alienated looking at other peoples tables wonder why we were singled out. In the end our food came so we'd rather just eat our food but the experience wasn't that great.

We were greeted by a blond female host and asked if we wanted to sit on the counter or table...I said, ""BOOTH"". She started to look for one and luckily a family was leaving cause I came in...lol. She mumbled something to me and I guess I didn't hear her. When she walked to the booth, she was laughing, ""Where did you guys go?"" Oh...lol. I haven't been to CPK in awhile and my buddy told me the pizza was enough for two people. Unfortunately, I count as two people. Make that  three people. Oh wait..my buddy eats like three people. Make that five all together. Marcella was our original host. When we ordered one pizza, which was the BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon ($13.99), she knew she wouldn't get a big tip from us since we were sharing. I ordered Sierra Mist ($2.50), my friend had ice water ($0.00). While we were waiting, we noticed that the walls were decorated with different pizza boxes. I wonder what the history was behind that. Our order took about 10 minutes and deliciousness was delivered. The first bite was how I imagined it. Tasted sweet and smokey at the same time. I already had 3 slices and my friend wanted more FOOD. So, I finished the pizza and this would be the last time we would see Marcella. My buddy was trying to order pizza, but he was stuttering and I told Marcella that he wanted to order pizza. lol. A Pepperoni Pizza ($11.99). Another 10 minute wait and more deliciousness. I was already getting full and our new server was Pim. She gave us our new pizza. I had one slice of the Pepperoni and I was done. I told you we were eating like five people. I am a big guy, but I don't eat as much. Pizza was very good, but, of course, its specialty pizza.  When the check came, my buddy took so long with his card to put in the check folder that Pim was wondering if he was going to pay or not...lol. I joked with her about it and she laughed away with a smile. Whats up with girls with me today? The Suburban ""Bourbon Girl"", the girls shouting at me, the blond host, and now Pim...lol. Our total was $31.25. I don't know how much tip my buddy gave her. I think it was $33.50 total.  The food court was packed and I wasn't sure if we were going to find the table. The food court was enough to shut us up. I had a Great Saturday. I would go to CPK more often, but I think CPK is a once-a-year type place.  The Yelp Universe.

Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,2.0,12/9/2010,"I've become wary of restaurant chains, especially those in malls. This CPK is no exception. Yes, I understand it's busy, but in the retail industry, you don't insult the customer before they're even seated and have ordered. We had put in our name and waited the estimated 15 min. They started calling out names for the parties of 2 and I started noticing that the people being called came after us. We checked with the host and he said he had already called our name. Total BS when we are sitting right next to you! Already off on the wrong foot, we were seated outside by the entrance. 15 minutes later and our order was finally taken. I'm thankful that one of the hostesses came and helped us get drinks 10 minutes after we had been seated when our server was busy with her other tables. The food we ordered that came was alright, but given the experience and the sub-par food, I'd try somewhere else in the Westfield mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=220

That's gonna be my last time eating there...  And by the way... They don't make the best BBQ Chicken Pizza.  Louise's Trattoria in Old Town Pasadenaa is much better!  The BBQ sauce there has a richer, smokier flavor.  All the other ingredients are higher in quality as well...  d:o)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=220
Leana N.,"Pasadena, CA",6,14,2,2.0,4/6/2013,"SERVICE was great. Although when I asked the server for butter for the bread she replied, ""We don't do that anymore, we serve oil & herbs with the bread."" I said OK but I found that off putting because whats the big deal about getting me some butter?  The new bread is a baguette that does not taste fresh and isn't as good as their previous bread that was offered. The decorations were old and the painted pizza boxes on the wall were dusty. It seems as though CPK is trying to cut costs with the bread/cheap napkins and it clearly shows.Though oddly enough when we asked for our food to go, they placed it in a large container and in a enormous togo bag; which seemed unnecessary and wasteful. But that's not my biggest ISSUE here... Later on in the evening when I chomped in to my CPK pizza leftovers I bit something that was awfully chewy. I thought well maybe it was a really rubbery mushroom so I swallowed it. I dove in for my second chew when I felt that odd rubbery sensation on my teeth again. I STOPPED chewing. I pulled the unknown ingredient out of my mouth and it was a HUGE knotted up RUBBER BAND!!!!!! I untied it and showed it in disgust to my family. ""Look what the hell I just found BAKED in our pizza!!"" I found it really appalling that my previous bite and swallow was a rubber band also, from the same taste and chew that I had assumed to be a mushroom. My friends and family told me to call and complain. It was already too late in the evening for that. Also I was probably going to get from the manager a doubtful ""Are you sure?"" And ""We're sorry."" So other then a stomach ache and an unpleasant experience to tell friends and family; there is nothing I gained from dining here. I shall not return. My advice to CPK is to train your prep and cooking staff to practice safer food handling/prepping techniques...and when a customer asks for butter with the bread; don't be cheap, YOU go back to the kitchen and get them some damn BUTTER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=220

Like a mall patio but inside.  Good dining option when you're at the mall. Sidenote: CPK has definitely changed how they make their pizzas over the last 2 years or so.

I haven't been to CPK in couple years but I remember loving the pizza before. I guess I've been spoiled by artisan pizza around LA or something because I could taste the difference in the crust! The crust at CPK tasted slightly artificial like a frozen pizza straight from the freezer. Why go to a restaurant if it's not going to be freshly made?

Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6051,2.0,10/20/2013,"I don't come to California Pizza Kitchen as much as I used to because I feel like the quality and quantity have both declined.  The service used to be impeccable, but the waiters and waitresses that I have come to recognize don't seem to be working here any longer. There are some days where you'll be lucky and have a more attentive waitress, but lately it seems like they don't know how to efficiently do their jobs and communicate with the other staff members. A few weeks ago, we had asked for water and it never came. We flagged down another waitress who flagged down our main waitress. The water still didn't come so we asked a waiter. It took a really long time before we ended up getting those water cups. And we had also asked for the complimentary bread and oil, which didn't come out. Our waitress was nowhere to be found and when she finally walked out to do her rounds, our food had already arrived. And one more incident that made my boyfriend upset was that the Sicilian pizza we had ordered was cold when they served it to us. When we asked our waitress if she could reheat it or have it remade - the dish it came on and the pizza itself was cold like it had been sitting outside for awhile before it was delivered to us - she looked like she didn't want to do that. We had to convince her that we had gotten cold pizza before she took it back inside. She didn't come back to our table until we flagged down a random waitress for the check.  My favorite two dishes from CPK are the Fettucine Alfredo and the Barbecue Chicken Pizza. The alfredo sauce is still really nice, but there are times the pasta is more chewy and hard than soft. As for the pizzas, I feel like they are shrinking more and more in size. They keep coming up with new crusts, but I feel like these ""new ideas"" only cause the pizzas to get smaller (crusts better, pizza smaller?).  This more negative review isn't based on only one visit, but an accumulation of 3 separate visits, where I felt like the service became more and more poor. Our waiters and waitresses who used to serve us with a smile are no longer here, and the new ones who are don't seem to offer the same service that the old ones did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=140
Esther K.,"Arcadia, CA",315,826,2224,3.0,11/9/2014,"How have I not reviewed this place already? I used to come here a lot when I was younger, since my cousins from Korea would like to come here. I came here for the first time in a couple of years, however, this past August with a couple of friends after we had watched a movie at AMC. The CPK is large with both indoor and ""patio"" seating (still indoor however) and we were able to be seated immediately. Service was pretty good since we came here for an early dinner and the place was not yet completely busy. CPK used to have this Chicken Tikka Masala pizza that I absolutely loved, but then they took it off the menu. That upset me, which is why I avoided coming here for a couple of years--nothing here is as good as that pizza! :P Anyway, we decided to split two pizzas between the three of us. We wanted to try some new styles, so we ordered the following: 1) CALIFORNIA CLUB: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, arugula, torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayonnaise. -- This seriously looked like a salad on top of a pizza. So much arugula and Romaine! The greens were a bit overwhelming; I'm not a fan of salads so I didn't care for this pizza very much. I did appreciate that each pizza slice got its own avocado slice, but there wasn't enough bacon for my liking. My friends seemed to like this pizza though. 2) SPICY CHIPOTLE CHICKEN: Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos, Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, cilantro and lime crema.  -- While this was a bit spicier than I expected, I ended up liking this pizza more than the California Club. It was more flavourful and I do love corn on pizzas. CPK has always been a decent choice for lunch/dinner. This location is convenient since it is at the mall, so if you are already there shopping why not stop by for a meal? I still have yet to find a pizza I really love here (that is still on the menu), but I definitely don't mind coming here every now and then with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=140

On the way to the very back of right back I saw two other tables available.   The server told us right off the bat that he was super busy but he'll be back to get our order.  We didn't see him for at least another 10 minutes.  We did get water and bread while we waited but we were starving.  When he took the order from her table behind us he drops by to say he will be back I told him we were ready to order.  He took our appetize, pizza and pasta order.  I think he put it all in at the same time because our pasta was Luke warm by the time they delivered it.  The table to north of us confirmed that that we got it cold.  Their pasta was steaming and ours was not.  For the 40.00 spend plus the tip was not worth it.  I won't be back.  He only refilled my water once and never came back to us.  Service was below e standard.   The manager came to check on our table  but it was before we really dug into our food.  Looking back I should have said something.  So I guess I will write about the experience now.  The garlic cream was not delicious like I remember it.  I asked one of the server who packaged our meal to go if they changed the recipe she said it had been years they made a change.  She said that now the sauce is prepackaged now,  well it use to be my favorite place it is now on the bottom of my list.  It is expensive and not worth the money.  I rather go to Cheesecake Factory.  There was no wait here and like an hour wait at cheesecake I see why.

Jennifer H.,"Pasadena, CA",128,175,74,1.0,6/17/2013,"I haven't ever minded the overpriced meals here, as a vegetarian I can always find something to eat here and they have so many options for everyone.  Some of my favs are the plain cheese, pear & Gorgonzola, and the BLT pizza (minus bacon, add avocado - which can also be ordered as the club with no bacon, no chicken... not sure why but the combo of the salad on top of the pizza has always been yummy to me).  They also have a good Waldorf salad, which I minus the meat on as well.  Alcohol here is expensive as well, but they do make a yummy raspberry lemon-drop. So, on to the review with this location, as I had a bad experience at this CPK:  I was seated right away, outside the restaurant, which I didn't mind, except he walked us over to a table that had a huge mess on the floor.  Food everywhere.  My foot slipped in some as I sat down.  My boyfriend saw and told the host in a polite way: ""You may want to sweep over there"".  The host must have thought by my boyfriend saying it nicely, that it was optional.  He started to go on about how they only clean the floors at night when they close!!  After waiting 20 minutes or so to find parking, having my feet in other peoples food and almost slipping, I decided I couldn't really accept that response and as nicely as I could, told the host ""the better answer would be to ask us if we would like another table or bring someone over here to sweep.  If someone spilled liquid on the floor you would clean it up so no one slips - I slipped on this food, it's the same thing!""  He looked at me like I was completely nuts, said OK and walked away.  My feet stayed in food the rest of the time we were there as he glared at me through the window.  I wondered if my food would be OK and free of spit.  It came out looking OK except it was quite overcooked.  I tried to eat it... crap, it's hard as a rock and tearing up the roof of my mouth.  I take the salad off the pizza and underneath is burned cheese.  My waitress was nice and offered to have them make a new one and asked if I wanted soup, but I can't eat the soup (meat).  But she did say they had a new dough and maybe it was that, that was different.  It was definitely overcooked and you could see the burned cheese and dough, as was my boyfriends but he was too hungry to complain much (except to say there is more meat on the Sicilian frozen CPK pizza than the one he got at CPK).  The second pizza wasn't overcooked and all was fine.  I just couldn't believe the excuse about cleaning.  I should have taken a picture, it was too gross! Update: I sent them an email about the experience and got back a ""we will look into it"" email and never heard back.  I did end up going here once more because I had a gift certificate and the food was decent and the place was more cleaned up, but the outside still could have used a sweep.  My waitresses here have always been nice, I think it's the managers that are incompetent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=280

Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1126,338,660,3.0,8/12/2011,"Situated in a upscale newly renovated mall, this particular branch has been here for years. It's corporate, but not bad. You can find the same dish here in CA as in South Korea.  Food:  Innovative yet traditional. Personal favorites are: Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, Chicken Milanese, The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped, Thai Crunch Salad, The Original BBQ Chicken.  Service: Professional and well trained. However, somewhat put off with the ""every opportunity to up-selling"" they employ. Server starts off by suggesting alcohol. If not, how about a specialty soft drink? Asked for ice water, they follow with bottle imported brands. Plain old tap for me. If you order an appetizer, they suggest two. Ask for bread, ""how about focaccia? if you don't like it, I'll take it off of the bill"". Would you like to add a soup? Coffee at the end? How about room for dessert? Okay, you get what I mean, anything to get that check average up.  Decor: Trendy when they first open, probably needs a bit of a make over. But of course I'm nitpicking now. It's still nice and clean.  TIP: You can pick up at Costco a $100 gift card for $80.  Take a date, the outdoor mall is nice. Very modern, very trendy. CPK is a nice place to stop and eat.

They said they don't accept reservations but they will sure put us on the list and prepare for us. We had 17 people and they were able to accommodate us outside. The downside is we can't be served alcohol which was fine. Some of our friends just went inside and got their drinks at the bar while we wait for the food to be served.  We always ordered the BBQ chicken pizza so my husband decided that we will have anything beside that this time. We ordered the Thai chicken pizza, pepperoni pizza and meat craver pizzas. We didn't care for the Thai chicken pizza but the other two were good. We ordered the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and they were delicious. My favorite pasta, broccoli, sun-dried fusilli with grilled chicken breast, was great as always. We tried the Thai chopped salad for the first time and it was surprisingly good!  CPK also have one of the best kid menus. A huge selection with good portions and reasonable prices. You can also add $1 for a huge sundae. I love their new ""handmade"" soda, $3 each with free refills. The waitress let us try different flavors for our refills.

DAVID T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,203,,1.0,4/26/2010,"Rude confrontation with a senior member of your management. I would like to share an unbelievable and uncomfortable situation that occurred to my wife, my 3 wonderful guests and myself, on July 3, 2009, at 5:30 pm at your restaurant in Arcadia, California at the Santa Anita Fashion Park Mall. My group frequently dine at your restaurants throughout California and have had many pleasant memories.  Last week we visited the Hollywood and Highland Center CPK and had a wonderful experience, took many pictures, and laughed a lot. What a complete difference when we visited your Arcadia location after our very pleasant visit to The Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens.  My group was very hungry after a long tour of the gardens and decided to dine at our favorite pizza restaurant.  We found one in Arcadia and was seated at an outside table.  A pleasant female server asked for our order and my friend Mercedes, her 2 teenage daughters, my wife and I ordered a complete meal.  We handed the server our ""Thank You"" card and waited for the order to arrive. The pleasant server delivered the Chicken Salad and indicated that our 4 pizza orders were in progress.  After approximately 10 minutes elapsed the general manager, Alex Montes, arrived and informed us that the card expired 2 days ago and that he could not accept it.   I informed him that we are frequent guests and asked for an exception.  Mr. Montes apologized and refused.   I informed Mr. Montes that I used to own several pizza franchises and the goal of marketing is to get the customers into the door so they may enjoy a wonderful meal and have pleasant memories.  I mentioned that my pizza franchise marketing budget averaged about $2000 per person to gain one customer and an additional $1500 per person to convince them to return.  Alex Montes, once again, humbly refused to accommodate us but mentioned that the Regional Director of Operations was present and may make an exception. When the regional Director of Operations, Bill Snodgrass, came to see me I could immediately see that he had a harsh attitude.  He arrived with a very stern face and abruptly asked what the problem was.  I informed him of my situation and he sternly replied that he will NOT accept the promo card because it was unlawful.  I asked if he can make an exception and simply discount the meal since my group was very hungry and excited to dine here. Mr. Snodgrass, with a pompous and arrogant attitude, replied that the promotion had expired and he will not accept it.  I exclaimed my astonishment at how far this has escalated in front of the other diners over a promo card that just expired 2 days ago.  It was unbelievable that an executive in management would rather embarrass his loyal guests in front of the Friday night, 4th of July crowd and throw away and waste the food that have already been prepared, than to pleasantly accommodate us.  Mr. Snodgrass was very staunch, rude and arrogant and he did not treat me respectfully.   My guests, my wife and I left the restaurant in disgust.  Our pleasant memories of CPK shattered after a nice tour of the Huntington gardens.  We decided to dine elsewhere. I don't understand how the management is trained but I believe your marketing department and the CEO would not be happy about how this situation was handled.  I would have been more understanding if the server immediately informed us that the promo card was invalid when we ordered.  But to have us wait over 10 minutes, the chicken salad and drinks served and the pizza baking in the oven, to tell us the promo card was invalid is a farce.  Once again, Mr. Snodgrass would rather waste all the food we ordered and have us leave unhappy, than to make a simple exception as a good customer service gesture and great marketing effort. Please let me know your thoughts in this matter.  Our average bill at CPK has been around $80.  A $75 gift card to dine at another CPK in the future would be appreciated in order to make a second attempt at dining without sad memories.   I appreciate your candid response to this unfortunate event. This a note I just sent to CPKI Contact Us Being rude to customers and have executives (the founders Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax) support this behavior will not make a successful company. You have lost millions over a $75 incident. Shame on you. It's been over a year and CPKI has not done anything to resolve this issue. They have LOST millions over a stupid $75 incident.  Like I warned everyone about this crappy customer service company - I predicted that their stock will crash because they have bad customer service. They have LOST millions over a stupid $75 incident.

I love CPK since they are always innovating and catering to the taste of their consumers. I used to always get their thai pasta or kung pao pasta.  These days I am in love with their Tricolore Pizza. It's good for a diet since its a flat bread pizza filled with salad, chicken or shrimp or salmon is additional. I always have a good experience at cpk especially the Arcadia location. They are quick and outgoing servers who do a good job with always refilling drinks and making sure you are comfortable. I got the $100 gift card at costco for $80. That is about $20 in savings, it's about a dish and half in savings. I know it's a lot to buy at a time for cpk, but I live close and its pretty convenient for me to just buy take out.  I don't recommend the curbside assistance since you have to give them tip just to hand you over the food in your car.

Service sucks but they're nice people. My parents are vegetarian and this place is very vegetarian friendly. The thin crust pizzas are very crunchy and the normal pizzas have yummy soft dough. Free bread and butter, the bread is like really dry but I still eat it for some reason. They started buying cheap butter or something and it was gross, so I stopped eating the bread haha.

Michelle K.,"Pasadena, CA",532,691,249,2.0,5/1/2010,"Honestly the only reason I kept coming back here was for the ""two in a bowl"" with the tortilla soup and chicken chowder and last night we went and the chicken chowder has been taken off the menu. I honestly doubt I'll be returning. First off, the restaurant smells like feet EVERY time I've been there.  I've been eating at CPK forever (I used to work in the mall).  Service is usually mediocre, food is usually good, and their peach iced tea is delicious. However, the BF and I have been there twice and both times we ordered a Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza and BOTH TIMES (albeit the 1st time it took them 3 tries) they forgot to put the pineapple on the pizza. We don't like to make a big fuss and I chalk it up to ""maybe she just heard us wrong"" but no...lo and behold she charged us for the BBQ.  At this point I'm annoyed 1) because this is honestly the 2nd time (really 4th) this has happened 2) because she didn't notice the pizza came out wrong 3) because she charged us for it.

Chris Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,60,6,3.0,9/25/2010,"CPK has some of the best pizzas you can find, but $13+ is a steep price for a medium sized platter. My family ordered: Thai Crunch Salad - The greens were fresh but the flavors were a bit lacking. It was pretty good, and I would recommend it for veggie lovers. Chicken Fettuccine - I do not recommend this. The dish is completely bland, and I had to season it with lemon and vinegar to give it some taste. And sour was all I could taste after. There was barely any chicken as well. Wild Mushroom Pizza - This was a very good pizza but on the salty side. The crust was thin and crunchy. The mushrooms were a bit meh. Hawaii BBQ Pizza - This was the favorite for my party. It was certainly delicious, but there wasn't that much topping. The bread that came with the meal was dry and tasteless. It's probably the worse bread I've had at any restaurant. Not that it is disgusting, it just doesn't compare with other places. Overall, the experience at CPK was just average.

Its not what you would expect. Its actually just Lemonade that's carbonated.  Food got to us pretty quick and our orders were correct-a-mondo! Refills were not automatic, what I mean is she would come by to see if everything was OK and can see that our glasses were empty but would not ask us if we wanted refills.

Tiffany H.,"Indianapolis, IN",752,1106,2728,2.0,3/14/2010,"I've been here quite a few times 'cause I grew up around the area. It's never too impressive but back in highschool, I was hooked on their Chinese Chicken Salad. At other CPKs, I've had their pizzas...but I'm not a thin crust fan. And, I really hated the pear and gorgonzola. CPK's service is always good..but their bread will forever suck. Ugh.  Anyways, this review will be based on my most recent visit. I went with family and we each ordered a dish (4 of us): Jambalaya, Chinese Chicken Salad, Chicken Picatta and Chicken Tequila Fettucine.  Jambalaya - I was so surprised, it was quite delicious. It had a nice consistency and it was too spicy but spicy enough for a little bit of a kick. It was interesting that it was angel hair pasta. There was plenty of shrimp and I believe that there was so lobster in there too.  Chinese Chicken Salad - It was too sweet this time. Chicken Piccatta - I think this dish was the most worth it. There was twice the amount of the other pastas we got. There were three pieces of decent sized chicken breast & it came with a side of angel hair pasta with some kind of lemon-y caper sauce. YUM!  Chicken Tequila Fettucine - It was a little too thick 'cause I like my pasta sauce-y. But, it had a nice lemony taste which was refreshing. I liked the bell peppers in it too. I'm used to green noodles (my grandma makes fresh spinach noodles) but this didn't taste like what my grandma makes, so I HOPE it wasn't all food coloring or something haha.  WE DIDN""T GET BREAD ): Although it's shitty, it's still nice to get free stuff yadigg?! Oh, I got lemonade too. I was intrigued by the flavored lemonade. The peach one was good but a little light. The mango lemonade was SO TANGY. Wasn't too bad though.  Like I said about, CPK is always mediocre. We honestly went 'cause we had a gift card.

Although I had to beg twice for water, after the soda and lemonade we ordered turned up flat and tasting like dish water, the service was better than last time. How hard is it to keep your soda carbonated? I guess that's why they try and push the alcohol and new drink menu a bit much. That's the main reason I'm only giving the place 2 stars, the other is that when the chicken caesar salad came the dressing was very sparse. The server brought more dressing when asked and the bread with olive oil was plentiful, as was the house salad and multi-grain penne pasta with salmon. The portions are huge but the taste was just passable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=320
F C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,79,545,4.0,2/20/2011,"I'd say CPK is a pretty consistent 3.5-4/5 and this franchise is no different. I've been to this one plenty of times and it's been the same (in a good way). Decor/Ambiance: 4/5. I like how they have a mock corner location in the mall to allow their glass windows to wrap around, making the place seem more welcoming and open. They also have a... not outdoor space, but... separate seating in the mall, right outside their doors. It's nice to sit there sometimes to be in the bustle of the mall itself. Service: 3/5. The manager was our seater yesterday and we had an accurate telling of wait time and were led to our seats quickly. Our server on the other hand, tried to be attentive, but something felt lacking. Maybe it was just his energy level. Food: 4/5. My friends and I ordered the Mediterranean Spring Rolls, which I absolutely loved- 5/5. Ignoring the calorie count, this was delicious! I've tried all three flavors before (others being Baha and Thai), and I always prefer the Mediterranean. The cheese in those spring rolls make me happy. This time, I got the Thai Chicken Pizza, though I also like their California Pizza. Word of warning: if you've never tried their California pizza, ASK how they make it. I remember my first impressions of that pizza were not good because it looked like they baked the pizza dough, and then poured a salad over it. Haha. Thai Chicken Pizza is always a safe bet because that's one thing that got them so popular anyway. Btw, my friend and I had leftovers by the end of lunch and then decided to eat them cold for a quick dinner- STILL yum. Rare for cold pizza. :) Overall: 3.5-4/5.

Tonight's dinner was exceptionally exceptional.  It looked like they were short-staffed with only 3 servers covering the entire restaurant - not an easy task considering the restaurant is pretty spread out.  Our server was probably covering 10 tables all at once.  But you know what?  She still met our needs and made sure that we were happy, always checking in on us and refilling our drinks.  She was probably stressed out as hell, but she definitely displayed grace under pressure.

Charlie H.,"Irvine, CA",348,51,19,4.0,3/11/2008,"So this CPK has been here since I was in Jr. High school.  Ever since then it's a restaurant I feel that you can't really leave and have a bad meal.  The food is usually pretty consistent as well. On this outing we found there were several new items on the menu.  We decided to order only ""new"" items this evening. Crab cakes - Saw a picture of these on the table and they looked pretty good.  When they brought out the plate we realized that the crab cakes were the size of silver dollars.  At first i was like ""wtf?"" but biting into them I was pleasantly surprised that they tasted great.  They used real lup crab meat instead of the cheap crap most restaurants use.  They also didn't use a crazy amount of breadcrumbs so the texture was just right.  The crab cakes were served with a concoction of black beans, corn, and tomatoes, somewhat of a southwestern style and also a dipping sauce. Miso Salad - This was another new item on the menu.  You have your choice of shrimp with lump crab meat, or chicken.  We chose chicken.  It's pretty similar to most of their salads.  Served with shredded cabbage, avocado chunks, cucumbers, daikon, edamame, carrots, red cabbage, green onions, cilantro, crispy rice noodles and crispy wontons.  All of this tossed in their miso dressing.  The salad was good overall but a little light in flavor so we asked for the peanut dressing from the thai crunch salad.  Maybe next time we'll just order the Thai salad. Cajun Pizza - We ordered this Neapolitan style which is basically a super thin pizza.  The toppings are blackened chicken, sausage, and a cajun creole sauce with mozarella, onions and roasted peppers.  This was a great tasting pizza and the thin crust didn't make it too filling. All of the items were pretty good and might even be ordered again in the future.  There are several other items that are great such as the focaccia bread, original bbq chopped chicken salad, thai crunch salad, and some great pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=340
Tommy H.,"South El Monte, CA",38,78,3,3.0,10/19/2010,"I  come here when I'm at the mall and I cant decide where to eat. Tried nearly all of the pizzas because who hasn't been to CPK by now. As far as it goes by a pizza chain, it's very decent. But I will mention that their pizza has shrunk somewhat. And that the portions have also decreased. I have no idea why, but it's smaller. Like very much so. The price is decent. Besides pizza they serve a variety of pasta and salads. They have some decent appetizers, but the whole asian influence appetizers are way over priced. 6 little dumplings does not cost 7-8 dollars. They also have beer here which is cool because it's in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=340
Nicole L.,"Alhambra, CA",7,60,12,3.0,10/18/2010,"First off, I was going to write a scathing review of this CPK until a gentleman by the name of Danny B. noticed how annoyed I was getting and came to the rescue. My boyfriend and I arrived and waited about 10-15 minutes for a table, which I guess is reasonable for a Friday night. Once we were seated, I noticed that the area was pretty empty, so I'm not sure if they just make you wait for ten minutes just because. After we were seated, another couple was seated after us, then a group of four women. The couple and the women that were seated after us, were all served first. To say the least, I was getting pretty angry at this point. Our menus were closed as we had already decided what to get while waiting the 15 minutes. Danny B. - who was not our waiter came over and finally asked if we had been helped. I'm glad someone noticed. Finally, we ordered our food - I had guacamole and chips and a tostada pizza, my boyfriend ordered the white pizza. The guacamole was very good the white pizza never fails. In my attempt to try something different, I tried that tostada pizza and it was just okay, kind of gross actually. I wont eat it again- it was strange. The relentless trying to up sell is kind of annoying. I told the second waiter, whom I couldn't understand - no I don't want desert, just the check and the leftovers to go - again, he asked are you sure? Yes, we are sure - we have to go to the Facebook movie in ten minutes on the other side of the mall!

One unsatisfactory thing I have with all CPK's is the bread they serve you when you sit down.  It's cold, stale and doesn't have much flavor to it.  I don't understand why a restaurant that makes specialty pizzas can't just bake up some decent bread.  I only eat it if I'm absolutely starving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=340

The service was bad, the food was bad, and the atmosphere made me feel like they wanted us to eat and go as fast as possible. I had the tricolore pizza. The crust was awful, hard and old. The salad toppings on top of the pizza was still in the shape of the cup they used to determine quantity. Plus, to make things worse, I asked to include $4.00 chicken breast. They gave it to me after they served the pizza. The chicken were small, very thin slivers of burnt chicken. Bad bad bad. My wife had the Thai chicken salad. It was very underdressed and again hardly any chicken. To me her salad seemed like cheap coleslaw with that crispy white noodles and little chicken.  My kids had the Mac and cheese. I was definitely irritated because the noodles were dry and they barely put any cheese on the noodles. They didn't even mix the two. About the only thing they got right were our drinks.

We had the spinach & artichoke dip to start, and shared a chinese chicken salad, in which they helped us ""split"" it with no charge. I also ordered a glass of moscato.  Aside from that, I have been here over 10 times, and through those different opportunities I have tried the following dishes: The BBQ Chicken pizza - delicious, and highly recommended! The Cobb Salad - Pretty standard, nothing special but always a ""safe"" bet The duck pizza - Pretty yummy but too pungent and too drenched in Hoisin sauce. The jambalaya pasta -  decent, but only ordered once. Thought it was too spicy. A ravioli dish - It was good, but the portion was too small. I wasn't full. And other random pastas, but I honestly don't remember their names. For drinks,  I have only had their Moscato, Prosecco (which is in a mini bottle, poured out in a glass), and a tasting of their ""Pink Moscato.""

Phung D.,"San Leandro, CA",144,508,1088,3.0,9/18/2009,"Since I tried almost all the dishes from them, I think I have an idea of how their food taste like...3 stars! I always get to try something new each time so I don't really remember all the names anymore but overall it's a decent place to go to when you have craving for pizza. When I first came here for the first time, it was really good and all but everything is just alright now, nothing to die for. The only thing I'm not very fond of is that it costs extra when you pick the meat of your choice for that dish. $2 extra for chicken, $4 more for shrimp. I don't see why they can't add that to the dish and have separated options like that for. - Lettuce Wraps: the name says it all...you wrap with lettuce! They always give you options for meat so we went with chicken. It came out a plate of minced chicken with lettuce wrap and sweet sauce on the side. It was flavorful and stuffs but it's not something I enjoy eating. - SANTA FE CHICKEN PIZZA: This has to be my favorite pizza from them but I don't remember exactly what's on it anymore since it has been awhile. I just remember it came with guacamole, minced tomato, olives on the side so I like it. I'm not sure if they still have this on the menu  since they change their stuffs from time to time! - Original BBQ Chicken Pizza...nothing special about this I guess. You can't go wrong with it. It's just pizza with...bbq chicken topping. - The Original BBQ Chicken SALAD: I think the salad would taste better without the bbq chicken on it. Even though I know it's bbq chicken but they made the chicken a bit too sweet. It didn't taste good either when it came out cold, so no bbq chicken with salads! Other than that, the salad was yummy, very fresh! - Pastas: . JAMBALAYA: 4**** pasta. CPK's specialty is pizza, not pastas but if you want something good, try this? I only like this dish out of all 3 that I tried.  . Thai Linguini: 2**. I don't like it! The noodles were kinda hard and the flavor was just not that great. If you can't handle the spice, then don't get this. Actually, it wasn't that that spicy but the spice just killed the dish. . Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: Wow, first time eating green pasta...yup, it was green!

The last time I went, I had a lot of the salad left over & asked for it to be boxed up. I guess the waiter thought I wanted the avocado egg roll (that my friend ordered) to be boxed up. So, he threw away my salad. Right before I was going to leave, I realized my salad was MIA. I asked the waiter and he was so surprised. He immediately told the manage the situation & the manager had a half-salad made for me to go. Amazing. The previous time, I found a small hair in my salad as I was almost done with it. I didn't want to complain because I was already done with the salad and I wasn't sure if it was my hair or not. But my friend told the waitress the situation. The waitress responded with, ""I wish you had told me sooner so I could have brought you a new salad."" I don't know why she would think I wanted to eat a salad that had hair in it.

Forgive me, fellow yelpers, you know I like to ramble on (like the Led Zepp song) but I spent almost 1/3 of my Good Sunday at CPK with my loved ones...ok, with my friends... ok, with the crew of ladies I go pillaging and plundering the local malls with and maybe enjoy a shot of something decadent with. After shopping all over the Glendale galleria with my girls, we needed someplace different to go to for the day. Enter the Santa Anita Mall. We had a great time walking around, and there were a LOT more of my people meeting and greeting. So we took our merry caravan of shoppers and ate at CPK. It was our base of operations for the day. 1st round - lunch. I know my friend Sarah really enjoyed her lettuce wraps (she cared more about them then her morning purchases). I myself had the chicken tequila fettucini. This is my preferred dish at CPK, and it was really QUITE tasty at this location. The creme sauce did not taste to milky and there was genuine kick to the chili. Nothing too bad, but enough to really fuel my afternoon shopping. 4 hours later, and many many miles walked and shopped through the store, we came back with different friends to compare what else we had picked up. 2nd round  - THE FOUR SEASONS PIZZA!  With Korean BBQ tacos. It sounds wrong, but it is so southern Californian and tasted so right. I must admit we were famished and had worked up an appetite, so I might have been biased, but IT WAS REALLY GOOD!  Remember that scene from When Harry Met Sally? The restaurant table? That was the contest... who ever could (discretely) vocalize just how good there food tasted.  *And yes, one of us did vocalize faking-it. The strawberry lemonade was a bit more bitter than what we had earlier the same day in the same restaurant, not 4 hours earlier. We held court for another hour there (and tipped WELL, mind you) while we made last minute dashes to stores that some of our friends had made great discoveries at stores we briefly skimmed.  Which of course led to DESSERT Round 3 - Key lime pie. As usual, it was up to the girls who carry the big guns to put away dessert. I may be 5'2"" but I can put down any dessert like a tiger taking down a kill! By this time, my taste buds are ready for the coup-de-gras, the gentle triumph over all.  Nope. Key lime pie should not taste like cheesecake, and vica versa.  It was good, but  I was hoping for true lime savor-iness. The fruit on top of it was also a little smaller than what I am used to at CPK.   Great location, great time, dessert could be better.

Jeffrey Y.,"Arcadia, CA",12,21,2,3.0,1/26/2010,"i'm usually cynical about American traditional restaurants because of the similar varieties that these restaurant chains have to offer. i have to admit however, a pizza like this is better than the typical pizza hut pizza. The pizzas are good, not great...just good...you can generally conclude that a finished meal at CPK feels simliar to a finished meal at in-n-out. I've always felt that American traditional restaurants had mostly the same ingredients...but uniquely shuffled around differently in each restaurant. If it's one thing i don't like about CPK, it's their tasteless pastas. Anyone can make better pasta than CPK; hence pizza kitchen, not pasta kitchen. overall, a trip to California Pizza Kitchen is a pretty pricey night out with only adequate foods.

Justin L.,"Alhambra, CA",1,53,2,3.0,4/4/2007,"They have fairly decent food, though the price is a little high. I spend around $47 ordering two pasta entees and a pizza. I could probably get a similar meal elsewhere for less, so I can't recommend it based on value.  The pizza I ordered was ok. The crust is soft, and I didn't get that ""hot off the grill"" feel. I like my pizzas hot, and it was just a little cold. Just personal preference though. Their service was good, very courteous but we had trouble with ordering a cup of coffee.  I can't give a truly fair review since I haven't tried all the items on their menu, but 3 stars is fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Michelle T.,"Alhambra, CA",47,124,,2.0,5/8/2011,"Is it or me or did CPK's servings shrink in size but we're still paying for the same price??  I ordered the Thai chicken pizza and it was consistent with other CPKs that I've been to.  I got a chance to try to the kung pao spaghetti and it wasn't very flavorful at all, other than just having a sweet and a lot of red peppers to make it spicy.  The portion of the pasta was so small too and I don't normally eat a lot either!!  We also ordered the white corn guacamole with chips and it wasn't good. I would  NOT recommend it!  We couldn't taste anything on there except guacamole and chunks of corn.  To spice up the flavor, I squeezed the lemon juice that came with my glass of water to kick up the flavor a notch.  And it was sparsely served with chips too.  The manager did come around and was asking customers if they were enjoying their food.  We did voice we were not too fond of the guacamole dip and he listened so that was good.  I don't think I will be coming back to CPK for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Jaydee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,75,416,2.0,10/7/2008,"CPK tasted so much better when i was younger... anyhow my husbi and i went on Saturday (10/4) our server was this blonde chick so i assumed she would speak English clearly... but we couldn't understand her at all.. she had a weird accent.. it wasn't like a cute southern or British accent.. it was just hard to understand what she was saying..she wasn't exactly friendly like most waitresses.. she seemed like she was in a rush.  we didn't get our water until our food came.. actually we received bread, water and our food all at once.. shouldn't the drinks come out first? then the bread? then the meal? and by the way, the bread wasn't warm it was..gross.  anyhow we ordered : bbq chicken cobb salad? - just wasnt' as much flavor as i remembered.. and my husbi tried it and thought it was just gross and didnt want me to eat it. and also the buffalo chicken pizza..the pizza was.. ok the portions are getting smaller! so basically we weren't satisfied after we ate so we went to another restaurant afterward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Manong P.,"Pasadena, CA",33,47,6,1.0,4/1/2009,"I'm sure there's millions of folks who like CPK, and with good reason. they probably love the food. In my experience though, their food seems to be on the super sweet end. i went to CPK for the very first time, but i've had their food on two other occasions through takeout.  So for this last visit i ordered something i know wouldn't be that sweet. Chinese Chicken salad and their Chowder soup. i've eaten chinese chicken salad probably dozens and dozens of times and am familiar with the taste regardless where i eat. This time it came super sweet. i couldn't taste the sesame at all. they filled it with that japanese sweet sauce that they put on crunchy rolls. so i move on to the chowder, though not super sweet, it was still sweet for a chowder. now i don't know what kinda chowder ya'll eat, but i know it shouldn't be sweet. i proceeded to taste my brother-in-laws jerk chicken pizza and that was sweet too! i know jerk chicken has sugar in it to balance out flavor, but never to dominate. the service was horrible too. we went in famished. but our food took soooo long that our stomachs grumbled. on top of that, the waitress forgot our soup (place had a few folks in, not close to crowded). major major disappointment.  hole in the wall spots still rule!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Hobart L.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,57,,4.0,3/5/2009,Good pizza place but is kind of expensive for my pizza taste.  The pizza taste clean and healthy maybe that's why it's more expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Ann Z.,"Long Beach, CA",2,160,,1.0,3/2/2010,"I still don't understand why people like this chain..I have tried so many different locations not by choice since every time I go into this place its because someone has picked it and it's always the same food and service sucks, it does not matter if it's the one in Seal Beach, Long Beach and now this one. I can get better tasting pizza at Costco.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Amy J.,"Arcadia, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/31/2010,"This is my favorite mid-priced restaurant. I've been coming to this CPK with my family since I was a kid and the food has tasted great all these years. It has expanded to have a curbside service where your takeout order is brought to your car in the parking lot area designated ""curbside pickup."" I recommend the chicken tequila fettucine--it's a favorite of my family and friends. I personally have the shrimp scampi pizza every single time I go because it is the best pizza I have ever tasted-- and I've had New York pizza and even traditional pizza in Italy! You can't go wrong with this place for a casual lunch or dinner. Plus, Auntie Aunt's Pretzel's is right next door and you can go shopping or watch a movie at the movie afterwards.

Roseanne F.,"Temple City, CA",144,175,5,2.0,10/22/2008,"I don't understand the hype.  It takes forever to get seated, it is really loud, and they don't even give you bread before your meal anymore unless you ask.  How cheap!  I don't care for the taste of their pizza.  The sauce is too tangy for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
Tasha H.,"Portland, OR",223,243,9,5.0,3/20/2008,"this CPK is always busy. always. and i cant blame em, they do have some good food. it's weird that i'd rather not order pizza here. ""HAHA, who doesnt order pizza at a pizza place?!"" right? well, they have lots of other awesome items on the menu. id only go here if i was starving, its date night, and me and the bf need somewhere thats not so damn private. after saying ""no"" a million times to getting pizza, the bf will order one anyway and i succumb to trying it out because it looks so damn good. but i'll order all the good stuff: - Avocado Club Egg Rolls TGIFridays and BJ's got nothing on these! they are bursting with avocado, and they look all expensive on a plate =) -Garlic Cheese Focaacia with Checca which is essencially garlic bread with buchetta. why is this sizziling good-ness so... good? i dont know, i just love bread goodies. - Fettuchine with Garlic Creme Sauce   mmmm sooo good! nicely seasoned and not too much garlic. OR -Chicken Piccata whatever the sauce is made with it must include some type of highly addictive substance... i crave it at 3am sometimes. augh! -Caramel Fudge Pecan Cheesecake there are, like, 15 of my favorite things packed into this petite slice of deliciousness. id kill to have my own personal cake. ...and so much more! i didnt mention what kind of pizza simply because you KNOW they got good ass pizza. a little on the small side for size, but bursting with robust sweet flavors. if its busy, count on waiting over 30 mins. or just take a seat at the bar... like we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360

Queenie N.,"Temple City, CA",183,24,6,4.0,1/17/2009,"CPK is one of the main date restaurants that my boyfriend and I go to. Kind of one of those ""our"" things that we have. This place has delicious food and excellent service. One of the few downsides to this place is that the wait can get a little long during the main dining areas. When I visit, I usually get the spinach artichoke dip along with a pizza of my boyfriend's choosing and maybe the portobello mushroom ravioli depending on if I was in a pasta-y mood that day. I have to say their spinach artichoke dip is the best I've had. I've tried spinach artichoke dip at various other restaurants; cheesecake factory, chilis, bj brewhouse & more, but none of them seem to match up to the one at cpk. Comparing the portobello mushroom ravioli from cpk with the one from Olive Garden, I would say it's definitely more worth it to get it from CPK. They give you more ravioli for a dollar or two less (unless you get sauteed mushrooms or something). Overall this restaurant is a place that I would definitely come to a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arcadia-2?start=360
