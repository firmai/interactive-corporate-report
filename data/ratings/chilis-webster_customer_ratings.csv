This place is so awesome.  I mean, come on...where else can you sit at the bar area, eat a decent meal, watch the game, drink your beer, and smoke?  Not very many places left in this area where you can do that unless you go to a crowded little bar.  But to do that in a restaurant....now that is KING!!  Love their food and service.  Our server always happens to be Ryan and he rocks.  He keeps our Presidente Margaritas (no salt) coming and always refills our chips when we run low.  To us, he makes this place what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452
47,Alexis B.,"Cypress, TX",161,11,2.0,1.0,2012-01-31,"This was the worst Chili's I have ever eaten at.  The service was horrible, the staff was rude and forgetful. They forgot to ring in my child's meal, so I have a starving toddler.  They brought out my salad and it was soggy like it had been sitting in the back window, my friends burger was cold.  With a kids meal you can choose milk, juice or soda - I requested apple juice. They do not carry apple juice because that is not stocked in their bar - umm are you kidding me.  My options were pineapple juice, cranberry juice and they ""might"" have orange juice.  My child drinks none of those and I have a sippy with milk in it already.  There was no option to not have a drink so I can pay $5 for food that didn't get rung in and a drink he doesn't need.  When I spoke to the manager she was apathetic at best.  I was so unimpressed!  I will not eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
36,Eva T.,"Houston, TX",48,34,,5.0,2012-03-31,"Geez lots of bad reviews...well I've been to worse Chili's but this wasn't horrible. They are always busy, they cheap and most of their food is ok to great. Nothing spectacular but I never expect that at a chain, we usually get the 2 for $20 deal. I normally order the Margarita Chicken...excellent dish! My bf gets the burger, pretty hard to screw up a burger, every now and then the bacon gets burned but it's still a good burger.  This last time we went, it was extremely busy. It was strange because our server told us he might be the server or someone else, just seemed real chaotic all around. Meh...whatever, he took the order, life is great, then we realize 30 min later, where is our appetizer. Immediately our entree appears but no appetizer :( We tell our server and he apologizes and asked if we would still like the appetizer and that he would take it off the bill, we declined because we were already eating the main meal. No big fuss, we were a little ticked but they did warn us about the backup in the kitchen. No less than 1 minute later the manager, Jeff, came out with our appetizer, apologized and said there were no excuses, and if we saved our appetites the desert would be on him too. He was very professional and sincere with his apology and about the mishap...and to be honest, it really made us feel better to be acknowledged in a such a way.  So yea, is the entire menu a smorgasbord of awesomeness...no, of course not, it's Chili's. Are there good things to satisfy you, hell yea there is, especially if you like greasy. Is the waitstaff great...most of the time yes, and if they do make mistakes, on our particular night we received a sincere apology and still felt like the customer was treated fairly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=20,2.324,2.324,2.324,2.324,2.324
20,Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",318,475,758.0,3.0,2012-05-11,"So it seems like Chili's has become my go-to place recently. I'm not real sure if that's a reflection on me or them, but who am I to complain about decent priced food that tastes great? Less filling calorie wise? Not so much. But that's to be expected. I believe they do have some ""lighter"" menu items but truthfully I didn't even care that night....lol  The one and only reason this place gets 3 stars and not 4 or even 5 is that smoking is allowed at the bar. I am not a smoker, and I can't stand to smell smoke while I am eating. That's just a personal preference and one that weighs heavily for me when I write a review. The other night I wanted a burger and a beer, and not necessarily in that order, after a really long, trying day at work. Hubby suggested Chili's and it sounded like a good plan. I knew they had the 2 for $20 deal which included an appetizer and two entrees and one of the entrees included was a burger so it definitely fit the bill. I was hoping for some happy hour specials, and they did have those but they were only good at the bar, which was a little irritating but not enough to either make me leave or deal with secondhand smoke. The host did try to set us near the bar, but when we found out about the smoking, he moved us back to a corner which was behind the wall with no eye rolling or snide comments, so that was a nice surprise, as other hosts/hostesses at different places have been less accommodating when we ask to move. The server was attentive and prompt and when I ordered my beer, asked if I wanted a water while I was waiting, which I thought was nice. We ordered the Texas Cheese Fries and two bacon cheeseburgers from the 2 for $20 menu and man that was some good food! Either that or I was just eating and drinking my stress away......either way I was happy! The burger was huge! And you get a s*** ton of fries too.... seriously if we had three people there we could have all eaten for the $20! I mean, I ate all my burger and some of my fries, plus my half of the appetizer and I was so super stuffed! Actually over stuffed and feeling kinda yucky later but man it was worth it! Our server was Brook, and he was great! Very attentive and funny, yet not hovering or overbearing. He tried to talk us into dessert but we were so flipping full there was no way. He invited us to ask for him when we go back and I thought that was a nice touch, and we probably will. Our total bill was $28 and some change for the 2 burgers, the appetizer and 2 beers....that's a great deal and with the great service and yummy food, I will most definitely be back! Just not to sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
39,Rob B.,"Keystone, SD",1,92,2.0,3.0,2013-02-16,"I found the other reviews to be accurate:  smoking section in bar can make other parts of restaurant unpleasant if you don't care for that, no hostess for several minutes, people waiting in line but there were empty tables, service a bit slow, but not awful, burgers were not hot and they had meager toppings.  I remember the early Chili's as having great burgers and tacos, but no more.  At least they did not fill up the empty tables and slow the service down any further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=20,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

Saturday night around 8 the place was deserted that should have been a clue. The floors were filthy walking to our table, the table next to ours was trashed,food all over the floor. Service was as bad as the place looked. The food was ok no problem there. We had to ask for silverware after the food was brought to the table,though. Took forever to get our check and the trashed table was not cleared throughout our meal despite there being hardly any customers.

But this has happened WAY too much at this location. The other reviews are very accurate. There was only one good server here. Don't remember her name but she is spot on and has lots of tattoos. Other than that, you can expect crappy service. At first I thought it was training issues which is why we had a string of poor service experiences but we kept giving them the benefit of a doubt. It wasn't until we came here for Veterans Day that Chilis disrespected my military boyfriend that I decided to boycott this location. When I called a manager over to discuss my experience all he could ask me was ""What do you want me to do?"" Rude and dumb people working here. Such a shame...

No host or hostess to be found on a Thursday night so we just sat ourselves in the bar. As we were waiting to be greeted three more families came in waiting to be seated as well. It got pretty crowded near the door.  Bartender was friendly and as efficient as he could be given he was waiter for the lounge, bartender, AND to go. Somebody else was hanging out behind the bar on a headpiece but they didn't seem to be very helpful.  The food was alright, but nachos weren't what I expected. As good as it can get for a chain. They had pretty good drink specials going on in the bar but stay away from anything cheesy. You have about 7 minutes to eat it because once it cools off it congeals and isn't as tasty as it should be.

12,Danna G.,"Houston, TX",489,153,194.0,2.0,2014-04-07,"Late night eats & drinks. We arrived here at around 10:45 pm and the place closes at midnight. Hostess was not available to seat any guest. So my husband and I seated ourselves as well as the other couple that walked in at the same time as we did.  I guess with it being ""so close"" to closing the staff had mentally shut down already.  We were eventually approached by a very nice waiter that took our drink order and offered a free appetizer because of the inconvenience. Chips & Salsa...salsa was refrigerator cold and chips were stale. At least that was free. I'm just not a big fan of Chili's; it's a cheap mediocre place to feed the family and not go broke.   I ordered the grilled chicken club burger and it was pretty good; the chickent was juicy and the food was hot. My husband ordered the fajita trio (looks like they changed the shrimp to the smaller ones but kept the price the same). They cheated me on the fries. Seems as if they gave me the last bits that were in the bag which were a few little hard pieces. The staff that did decide to come out of the kitchen was fairly nice. It had been at least a year since I had been to Chili's and it will prob be at least two before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

15,Max Q.,"Houston, TX",0,42,,1.0,2016-11-15,"Due to Chili's tone-deaf response to public outrage when a manager literally took away a meal from an honorable and documented vet on Veterans Day, we will no longer patronize this Chili's location or any other.  My NASA area veterans' group is taking our weekly meeting to TGIF.  This location has been good in the past, but we will not support a corporation that appears to obfuscate the action or lack of action taken against a manager who insults and disrespects our fellow veterans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
8,L A.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",3,26,5.0,1.0,2016-12-28,"Came for dinner. It was around 7:30. Ordered two teas, an appetizer and a burger to share. We had to flag down a different waiter in order to get a refill on our drinks after waiting 5 minutes with them empty. Appetizer was good. When the food finally came, you could tell it was sitting under a lamp or something for a while. Fries were cold, and the burger, which had been cut in half, was also cold. In the mid portion where it had been cut, there was spinach or something on both halves. I'm assuming leftover from whatever that knife had cut previously. Can you say cross contamination?! We sent the burger back, and paid for the appetizer and left. Won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
5,A. S.,"Houston, TX",58,119,14.0,2.0,2017-02-26,"""Oh, not that Chili's... let's go to the GOOD Chili's!"" At least, I thought we were at the ""good"" Chili's. Waitress disappeared for 10-15 minutes, long enough for my husband to comment on it. We decided to just let it go because she did come back and delivered prompt service. Unfortunately, my margarita ***may*** have had a single splash of tequila in it. Not stoked, but alright.  Our order was incorrect so they ended up having to reorder the correct menu items and when the food actually came it was SWIMMING in grease.  I understand to expect a certain level of grease when ordering a hamburger, but the lettuce was DRIPPING, y'all. The top bun wouldn't even stay on it was sliding all over the place. Flavorless beef to boot.  What gives, Chili's? I thought this used to be a decent place to eat, but I could've just gone to the one close to home for this level of service/food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
3,Rick Y.,"Webster, TX",14,54,202.0,4.0,2017-05-14,"I stopped by Chili's in Webster, Tx to get an early dinner with my girlfriend.  We both ordered the chicken crispers because we are just big fans of it.  I ordered the roasted corn version while my girlfriend ordered the standard corn on the cob. So as usuall, the chicken crispers were good but did seem a little more fried than other times.  Still good tasting and yes I ate all my plate haha.  The roasted corn was really really good. The closet thing I could compare it too is a Mexican version of an elote.  The mayo/butter and the seasoning was great and was in every bite.  We did order the Texas French fries (cheeze, jalapenos, and bacon).  They were tasty and came in a cool cast iron skillet.  I would of ordered another appetizer but it was not my decision that day I guess :) Either way, service was good and I will be going back some time in the short future.

2,Whitney V.,"Pearland, TX",38,160,277.0,4.0,2017-08-17,"Chili's has upped their game in the past few years, offering lighter options and new recipes. We once avoided it after stomach aches and a lackluster menu, but we visit it at least monthly now for fresher options. Service at this one is also good, with the restaurant looking cleaner when we visit early on weekday evenings. The food is flavorful, but not quite as good as other Chili's we've visited. For example, the pesto mayo is more mayo and less seasoning than other spots, but those are minor details. They are always accommodating with our requests to remove or substitute for food restrictions as well. The biggest two drawbacks for us are atmosphere. The music is always so loud. Sometimes it's difficult to carry a conversation at the table. Their bar is also open with half bars. When I came in around 4:30 for a to-go order, I was immediately hit with the smell of cigarettes. Turns out one smoker had the entire restaurant smelling of smoke so badly I had to wait in the back to try to avoid it because the bar opens to the front. In today's world, not a classy move. If there were 3 1/2 stars, it'd be more appropriate, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
0,Lauren L.,"Houston, TX",31,152,78.0,3.0,2017-08-19,3 stars because the food was served hot and was flavorful but we were seated in a location which was close to bar and the cigarette smoke was awful even though there are glass divider along the booth almost a full wall.  So we asked to move and no hesitation we were.  I think it should this place needs to become no smoking or remodel and separate the dinning & bar area better.  It's chili's nothing fancy but it's tasty and saved me from a long evening in the kitchen since I had not prep my meal the night before.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
1,BigFishLittleFish F.,"Dallas, TX",0,60,13.0,2.0,2017-12-16,"We were in town to visit family and considering Chili's is on a 'new and improved' campaign, we wanted to give it a try. I think the new menu is on track but sadly, the experience we had at this location cancelled out all the good things you are trying to accomplish. I have to give kudos to our server and partner/server and I wish I had their names. They did a nice job! However, we had issues with the temperature of the restaurant and on 4 occasions, had to leave our group to speak to someone about the freezing subzero temps. Think there were clues when the other diners were wearing winter coats while eating? Think there were clues when you had 3 other parties seated and left or asked to be moved? Where was the manager?? Seriously, where was the manager? We may give another location a try but my guess, not one person in that entire dining room will return to this location. Very sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
