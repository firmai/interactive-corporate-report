73,Crystal P.,"Corinth, TX",25,70,,4.0,2012-02-04,"The parking lot at this location on Friday night is terrible! I would have thought they would open up more parking but the entire back lot was marked off for valet. I looked and looked for other spots, eventually gave up, and parked in the valet area. Oh well. Other than that, I have been a long time fan of Red Robin. Their burgers are fantastic! I ALWAYS get the A1 Peppercorn burger. It's the only thing I  have ever ordered because for me, it's perfection. It's got crunch. It's got all the flavors I could ever hope for in a burger! Just thinking about it makes me want to run out and go get another one today! I just might have to pursue this plan further if my mouth continues to water. Pavlov's syndrome? Anyway, as you can tell by every other review... the fries are bottomless. I did notice that they serve less fries to start with which I LOVE. I used to feel like they gave too many fries at the start for them being bottomless.  All in all, I would rate Red Robin my most favorite burger place in Dallas for their consistency, fantastic flavors, great prices, and generous portions. I love to eat local but Red Robin (even though they are a chain) is really quite impossible to beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=60,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003

65,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",516,2583,7.0,3.0,2012-07-19,"I'm gonna make an exception here: constructing a review of a chain outpost. This specific burger-based corporation has a few things going for it: it centralizes around artisan burgers, the fries keep on coming along until you are ready to puke out mashed potatoes, and quality service is really emphasized across the board. I just really wanted to get in for their ""summer special"", and this was actually my first time at Red Robin--Yummmm. Yeah, that's another fine aspect at this fine institution: a good jingle that pretty much everyone knows. That surely must be why they were winning some rowdy rewards for the ""Best Chains in America"" last year. A good win always makes for a winning experience. The Fiery Ghost burger boasted ghost ketchup, which was cloyingly sweet and possessed almost no sweetness at all. Let's break down the other components: fried jalapeno buttons and actual jalapenos. I don't know where The Crimson Bird gets these spicy green guys, but they were not spicy in the least. A disappointing burger. One complaint that many people voice here is the actual size o' the burger. Apparently it is on the fringe of being under 4 ounces. I cannot believe they are serving these small puppies at a full-service joint. Moving onto the ""full-size."" A little better, certainly more pricey--but at least you can customize the ""how do you want it."" No more than medium... please. But be wary of raw. At national burger eateries, they definitely utilize industrialized meat. OK, the true winner: unlimited fries. These suckers are for sure frozen and fried from the ice box, but whatever. All you can eat. And you get a bottle of Red Robin Sauce. I actually very much enjoy the Tavern Sauce--though it is pretty much like Thousand Island, it does give a nice tangy sweetness to your salt oil-cooked largely sliced tubers. Yeah, yeah, generic review. Red Robin; yummm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=60,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

Guacamole on a burger? get out! Goat cheese, grilled pineapple, fried jalapenos? They even have different breads and tons of sauces to pick from. My personal favorite is always with onion straws and BBQ sauce and whatever else catches my eye, but there are so many combos it can be hard to pick.

58,Nina W.,"Spokane, WA",3,46,15.0,5.0,2013-08-05,"Not only do I love Red Robin as a chain, I love this location in particular. They hardly ever mess up an order (I come here a lot), but the one or two times they have, they are always very gracious about correcting it. Another point I would like to make about Red Robin in general is, if you or someone you know is a vegetarian, this place is the bomb. You can order any burger however you like it, and they will switch out the burger patty for a Gardenburger or a Vegan Boca Burger. What?!?! That's so exciting! No more awful, bland veggie burgers. My favorite burger is the Whiskey River, but I'm a huge fan of the Burnin' Love and the Blue Ribbon (minus the weird tangy sauce; I think it clashes with the blue cheese). Now, if you are a strict vegetarian or vegan, I'm not exactly sure about their cooking methods, but if you are just a pretty basic ""no meat and/or no cheese"" kinda person, you will have a blast trying all their burgers. I, for one, have never had an issue with them giving me the wrong patty or my burger tasting like beef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=40,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007
82,Katy B.,"Arlington, TX",0,20,3.0,5.0,2013-10-09,"I love this Red Robin!!!! Of course, Red Robin isn't the best food I have ever had, but that is not the point of going here. If I want a burger, or chicken sandwich at night, but don't want fast food, here is a good place to go to curb the craving. The people here were extremely nice, we came in 30 minutes til closing and left 30 minutes after closing, but we never felt rushed. Our waitress, Brittany, was extremely sweet and talked to us for a long while even though the restaurant was closed. I enjoyed the fries BECAUSE it didn't have seasoning on it. I eat a low salt diet, or try very hard to, and at other competitors places I have to wipe or shake all the salt off and it still tastes like a salt lick. Although other people might like that, I don't. With the seasonings on the side, you can control how much you want. That is a much smarter idea. Also, when it came to asking for gluten free buns, I did not know that they also fry their fries in a different fryer if you are gluten free. Not sure if that makes a difference but it is just a nice gesture. I got their pumpkin spice shake, and expected it to be extraordinarily sweet, but when I received it, it was as if it hadn't been sweetened at all. But, that was nothing to complain about for me because I loved it that way, it was a nice change. All in all this was a great experience, much better than that other restaurant where there is enough salt to preserve you for god knows how many years.

My husband ordered the Royal Robin with an over easy egg and cooked medium well, bottomless sweet potato fries, and a bottomless root beer float. My daughter had chicken fingers, mandarin oranges, and nibbled off my fries. My husband would give his burger 4 out of 5. The egg was under cooked, but the burger was perfectly cooked. I'm normally not a sweet potato fan and yet I LOVED his fries they were incredible. He regretting getting the root beer float, paying almost $5 for a dessert when you get such a large amount of food he figured out the gag lol. My daughter loved her chicken, oranges, and fries. Matter of fact she'd bite into a fry and do a cute ""wiggle"" dance each time lol. Sadly mine wasn't the best. My burger was perfectly cooked, but it was BLAND. So bland. Turns out the cook forgot to season my burger. My salad was fantastic and the fries were great.

I substituted the regular fries for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic! I am a sucker for sweet potato fries! Thin and crispy, just the way I like them. We also had a small side of Mac and cheese and it was ok. It was American cheese and it just tasted and looked like something from a box to be honest. For appetizers, we ordered the onion ring tower and fried zucchini. Both were delicious. But c'mon - anything deep fried is delicious! I like how they both come with sauces and they're always willing to bring you extra.  For drinks, I ordered the Cookie Dream milkshake and also mooched off of my cousin's mint brownie shake as well.

30,Shauna T.,"Arlington, TX",257,267,289.0,4.0,2014-09-08,"How have I not written a review for Red Robin... I should be ashamed of myself. The burgers here are excellent and I love how the fries just keep coming. I really like how casual this place is. If you're looking for a nice place to get your hands dirty while eating a satisfying burger, you have found it. Red Robin has a burger for everyone and every burger comes with endless steak fries.  Burgers: My go to burger is the California Chicken because I love avocado and bacon on anything. However, the last time I visited, I had the Royal Red Robin. I always thought the California Chicken was the way to go for so many years, but I've actually been depriving myself of an awesome burger that just blew me away. I see why the Royal Red Robin is a signature burger because it literally has everything in it, and it's topped with an over easy egg. Yum.  Fries: To accompany a good burger, Red Robin gives an endless amount of steak fries. Perfect consistency to accompany the several different sauces that are available. My personal favorite is the signature Campfire sauce, which tastes like a mild version of Chick Fil A sauce. There's almost (if not already) 10 different sauces to choose from. I also get a kick out of the bacon sauce because bacon on anything just makes it so much better. Bacon in my burger, bacon flavored sauce for my fries.. Can't get enough. Drinks: They have your beers and margaritas, but I have to emphasize the milkshakes here. They are awesome! I had the mint brownie milkshake last time and I loved the chunks of fudgey brownie in an ice cold, creamy mix.  Impossible to leave hungry here. Huge selection of burgers, but if you don't like any of them, there's an option to build your own.

The freebie guest usually never tips on what the bill would have been, if at all.  She did not ignore me or treat me like she expected me not to take care of her. Sam was friendly, attentive even to the point of suggesting for and making me a dipping sauce that she personally likes.  The conversation was light, not too much or too little.  This is not any earth shattering review, but in these concepts you never know what you will get in terms of service.  It was just refreshing to get good service.   Go see Sam.  She will take good care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.088,3.6400000000000006

I order a crispy chicken sandwich, sesame seed bun, bacon, avocado, barbecue sauce,Swiss cheese, onions, and a fried egg. The waiter advised to get the egg a little more fried than usual, it was superb! The sandwich was fresh, hot, and not sloppy. The salad had the usual veggies, cucumbers & croutons as well, you pick your own dressing. & of course endless steak fries! The wait was 20 minutes, that's great for a Friday and for what seemed to be a consistent flow of big parties. The waiter was super outgoing and friendly, though he slacked a bit on drink refills and napkins. Clean area, not too crowded, and overall good ambience.

31,Ashley W.,"Fort Wainwright, AK",0,4,5.0,1.0,2016-02-16,"TERRIBLE service during the day.  Sat in the bar and the server took about 5 minutes to get to us (no big, but should have been a sign) took our drink orders, slammed our drinks down and disappeared for another 10-15 minutes. Had to ask the hostess to send her back because we were ready to order and were on our lunch break of one hour only. She came back irritated, took our order with sass, and left again.(other guests had to go to the bar to order their food from her or ask on the status of their meals also)  After another 10 minutes of no food we asked about it and she said ""it's coming. I'll send a manager"". Well Jared came over and told us ""it's on it's way we have been in the back working on a huge to go order and that's why we have been taking so long"" being irritated we dared to ask where our food was after sitting in the restaurant for 35 minutes at this point. We told him it would have been better to have told us that service would have taken longer today because of the large order and let us decide what we wanted to do. He said ""well we have a big order what do you expect me to do"" and started getting loud with us. I told him I've worked in food service before and you manage all parts of your restaurant and if you need help or can't do that then get another manager. He started yelling at us and we told him he was being unprofessional and he said we insulted him by saying he needed another manager. We told him he was insulting us and that you don't treat customers that way. I asked for the corporate number and he said ""IM the general manager"" and I said yes but I want corporate and he said ""it's at the hostess stand"" we told him we no longer wanted our food and we would be leaving, as they had wasted our whole lunch hour ad we had to go.  He decided to make a scene yelling across the bar saying ""oh no don't you worry it's on me and I'll box it up for you"" as we were walking away.  We stopped at the hostess stand to get the card and they were out and had to go get more. Jud came up and was trying to do damage control because Jared was OUT OF CONTROL at this point. I've never seen someone who is supposed to manage a store act that way because he got offended he can't handle two things at once. Jared proceeded to walk up in between us talking with Jud, who asked what happened and was trying to fix it, and Jared tried to put the to go bags ON US and make us take it, and finally set them on some menus between us and Jud. Jud had to turn to Jared and tell him to walk away. WHO ACTS LIKE THAT? What kind of ""manager"" acts like that????  The proprietor needs to SERIOUSLY reconsider Jared's role at this restaurant and either do some elaborate retraining with him or just let him go. As far as I'm concerned, this restaurant will fail with Jared because he's too concerned about his ego rather than being in the customer service industry.  ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.   And after alllllll of that we still have not heard from the manager or person in charge of that restaurant.  Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.404,3.5600000000000005

23,Jessica C.,"Arlington, TX",0,12,7.0,5.0,2016-11-25,Vegan here with a non-vegan fam and kids attending. I had the guacamole bacon burger sans bacon and replaced with their boca burger. Yum! Requested open faced but came fully faced. I ate the whole face. Lol. Food was delish all around. Customer service on point. Morio is a top knotch waiter. Great place for kids too.  Definitely a reliable classic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
16,Amber W.,"Irving, TX",70,36,36.0,4.0,2017-01-05,"I love Red Robin. Always one of my go-to restaurants that both me and my boyfriend really enjoy. I've never had a bad experience here until recently. There were 4 hostesses at the front and not a single one looked at us or even acknowledged us when we walked in. Rude! Honestly the waiters and waitresses make up for it tenfold. They are awesome and super cool. Its unfortunate that the people at the front set the tone for your experience but if you can bypass their rudeness, the waiters and waitresses really make up for it. And the food is so delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

6,Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1282,673,344.0,3.0,2017-05-27,"Red Robin is our ""go to"" burger place. My wife and I frequent several different locations and have had good experiences at all of them with the food and the service. We love their fried zucchini, fried cheese and jalapeno coins. Many times when I'm in the mood for a burger, my wife will get one of her favorite appetizers. During a recent visit that was the case. I wanted a burger and she wanted fried cheese and jalapeno coins (fried jalapeno slices). Since I've had problems finishing their 1/2 pound burgers in the past I decided to try one of their Taven Doubles. They're a double patty burger and a bit cheaper than their signature burgers. I decided on the ""Smokey Jack Taven Double."" It sounded delicious and just what the doctor ordered. Our server was very efficient in getting our drinks to us and taking our order. When I ordered the ""Smokey Jack"" he even remarked that he had tasted it and it was yummy! I couldn't wait. Instead of their famous steak fries, I opted for the sweet potato fries with the spicy ketchup. YUMMY. I'm a ""seasoned"" restaurant manager. Even though I haven't been in the business for close to 20 years I look at my dining experience from a totally different viewpoint, through the eyes of a manager. Fairly quickly our order was delivered. My wife's appetizer was perfect and my Tavern Burger was just the right size. It was manageable and I wouldn't feel stuffed after eating it. My burger was hot, juicy and delicious. Halfway through the burger, I discovered it wasn't a ""Smokey Jack"", but just the regular Red Robin Tavern burger. I should have noticed it on the first bite but it just didn't dawn on me. Halfway through eating a burger, I wasn't about to complain and get another burger prepared. Yes, I should have brought it up to the manager in charge, but we were short on time and due at an appointment. I also wasn't out for a free meal. I am sure that there was just a mixup in the kitchen. There was one other strange thing that happened, the menu price stated $6.99 for the Tavern Burgers, but I believe on our ticket my burger was priced out at $7.99. And yes on the ticket, it stated ""Smokey Jack."" It wasn't that big a deal and I didn't realize the error until I got home and looked at an online menu. I didn't customize my burger at all with any additions so it should have been $6.99. This experience will not deter us from visiting our favorite burger places, Reb Robin. We will be back again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

She ordered a Burnin' Love, and I got the Whiskey River BBQ. Both of the burgers were delicious, and so big that we could only eat half of our burgers. The fries were delicious as always, and we love that we can order more fries! Red Robin, that is an AWESOME practice! We treated ourselves this time with our drink of choice. Deciding to put calorie counting to the side for the lunch, we both ordered cream sodas! She raspberry and me orange. How delicious! We even got seconds on these.

However, the last couple of times we have been there, the service has been lacking. We waited forever to get drink refills. When we asked for the check, the waitress told us she'd be right back. But about 10 min later we see her standing at the hostess booth chatting. We had to go up there ask her for it again. We will probably continue to come here, but will make sure we are not seated in that servers section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
10,Brad D.,"Waxahachie, TX",58,47,2.0,5.0,2017-09-07,"Really got to give this place some serious kudos! Was there last week and accidentally ordered a burger that came with mushrooms. Didn't even realize it until they brought it out, but I am very allergic, so I asked if they could remake. Totally my fault for not paying attention to what I was ordering, but the waitress was so apologetic and took it back right away. The manager even came over to apologize (even though I told him it was my fault completely) and brought some fries for me to eat while he remade my burger. Great customer service is always expected by consumers but not recognized nearly enough! Thank you to this awesome restaurant, who's always clean, always friendly and always has excellent service and food! To the restaurant manager, you really know how to run a successful business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

7,Jesse S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",15,89,25.0,1.0,2017-09-17,So came to this dispicable place after a very long hiatus.  It was so long I had forgotten why I stopped coming.  In my mind I loved the fries but the burger was a complete fail. See attached picture. In fact I think it was worse than before the reason I stopped going.  I had to come home and put condiments on my very dry lifeless burger.  The fries were still good and they give you plenty even to go. The restaurant had just opened and I ordered in the bar. It was obviously not clean due to the smell and the flies everywhere.  This was the reason I opted for Togo rather than eating there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
0,Darrell S.,"Arlington, TX",0,35,18.0,4.0,2017-09-23,"This place is on my families normal rotation for lunch / dinner because it's conveniently located and generally has something that will appeal to all members of the family and with 2 little ones that's not the case with everywhere.  It's also handy to bribe your kids into acting appropriately in order to get a free balloon before we leave.  I know you're jealous that I can still bribe my kids with a balloon.  This age will soon pass so I'm enjoying every second of it. It was hot Saturday so the requirements for lunch with the grandparents was that the place have cold drinks and an AC.  Red Robin fit the bill.  I got the turkey burger, the wife got the Royal Red Robin which has an egg and is one of our favorites and Nana got the ""Wedgie"" which has no bun and Papa got the veggie burger so we covered almost all the things they have burger wise.  Everyone was very satisfied and due to unlimited fries, VERY full.  Our server while being pretty busy was on point and even found the time to interact and have a playful joking manner, she was great. This place also has some pretty good desserts so if you have the will power to turn down the 3rd (or 4th) basket of fries keep that in mind ( I wasn't able to this time).  Overall a very filling experience with good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

The person in the background was audibly huffing and puffing, saying to someone else ""are you kidding me?"". Would they prefer I come sit in some poor servers section until after close? I am in the industry and if someone told that to a guest in my building they would need to find a new job. We're simply trying to be polite by making our order take out. Instead we will take our business to one of the other dozen restaurants right next door. We ""are not kidding you"" when we say we will never try to order from your restaurant again.

I am in the industry and I understand being busy and getting in the weeds but the way our waitress left our table is unacceptable. The picture I attached is what the table looked like when she dropped our desserts. We had no where to move to eat. It was all building up since appetizers. We accidentally spilled a drink on the table trying to rearrange stuff so we could have room the have dessert.  We moved plates to the side so she could reach to clear it for us but each time she came to check on us she dropped something off but didn't take anything with her. The result was a disaster of a table, with no room for dessert. Side note, I cleaned up the spill myself and asked for a new set of silver be for a fellow server and he rolled his eyes at me and said it's not his table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
