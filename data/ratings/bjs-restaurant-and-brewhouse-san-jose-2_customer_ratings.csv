346,Jan P.,"San Jose, CA",302,861,1692.0,4.0,2013-09-23,"We came today for the soft opening which provided training opportunities for the new employees. In addition, the food was free (though via a variety of select menus) and 100% of the booze benefited the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. All the employees were extremely friendly and particularly ebullient.  The restaurant itself is nestled at the corner of Coleman Ave and Autumn St, by Panera. My first impression was that it was nice and clean with a very open layout -- though isn't as large as some other BJ's. Parking might be an issue with overflow into Target's parking.  My group was seated at the bar and though one gentleman at the bar appeared to be our main server, some number of employees walking around through out the restaurant checked in on us and provided requested items (extra plates, utensils...). At one point of us waiting, a young lady brought a pork chop to us however we did not order one and it was quickly shuttled away. Anyhow, we started with BJ's signature berry cider which was AH-mazing -- new favorite drink over Wyder's (but sadly, not for home purchase). We then went into our main entrees: the standard deep dish pizza was solid, my jalapeno burger with chipotle mayo was delicious, and the chicken marsala was okay (though my coworker really enjoyed it). For dessert, we tried the beignets for the first time and O-M-G, with a mound of vanilla ice-cream, whipped cream, and strawberries, it tasted just like funnel cake from a fair. Delicious and great dessert alternative to the pizookie (though ours was slightly raw at the center). Overall we had a really fun experience. Great, convenient location, solid food for a BJ's, and friendly, helpful staff. Perfect for happy hour! One qualm? The front door! A revolving door, really? I could do without (granted a single regular door flanks each side of the revolving one).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=340,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
701,jim w.,"San Jose, CA",0,33,,1.0,2013-09-30,"This rating is only for those seeking to watch a sporting event.  This is, without question, the most poorly designed ""sports bar"" that I have even seen.  There is a central television which can be ""split"" into several smaller screens.  That is great if you get one of the four bar stools in front of the screen, or one of the tables directly behind it.  Otherwise, you are cranking your neck to view what is a rather small, low quality television screen, We waited for 15 minutes to get a seat only to sit at an angled stool for three minutes and walk out of this place and over to Chili's, which has far inferior food.  This is really unfortunate since I have been to the BJ's in Cupertino on multiple occasions and found the bar to be a great experience.  It is highly unlikely that this layout can be changed since the entire back of the bar is dedicated to showcasing multiple bottles of the liquor that is for sale. This was an absolutely dreadful experience for someone who lives within walking distance.  I will NEVER return and I discourage anyone seeking to watch a game from entering this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=660,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

I couldn't  make the soft opening but I can tell, they put a great effort to train their staff well. The gentleman who first served us was great. He was followed by another young lady and she was fine. You can tell they were getting ready for a big lunch crowd. I feel bad for chili's! The person who brought our pizza to the lady who collected our check were all very friendly. My husband thought the bathroom was beautiful and very clean. Yes, it's a new place with a new car feeling. So, the food.. We came for the party for 2. Wedge salad was good. Pizza is great. Soft dough with a lovely hint of garlic. Ham was excellent. What wasn't excellent was the lack of tomato sauce? Little tomato drops is not the deep dish of Chicago? But still good. Pizzuki...ghiradelli chocolate chunk was amazing. My husband had to keep up with me otherwise it would have been gone in a flashbite. Getting the change back from the bill took a little long considering we had to get going for work and a tired baby. Root beer. Yum! Vanilla cream soda? Delish..had a Carmel/vanilla flavor. We will have beer next time. Yep, can't wait to go back with my premiere card.

434,Tom L.,"San Jose, CA",150,22,1.0,1.0,2013-10-09,"very disappointing experience, this location is not off to a good start. Lousy management, I highly recommend just driving to Oakridge (or Fremont if you live north).  I called in to check the wait ""how long is the wait for 2?"" ""it's 20 minutes"" I was then ASKED ""would you like me to put you on the list?"" ""yes, we'll be there shortly""  We arrived  about 20 minutes later (wed night, no A's, no Sharks). The person ahead of us had walked in and been quoted a 20 minute wait for walk ins. We reached the host and we're also told 20 minutes (Seems like a pretty common quote of time at this point). I let the host know we called in and were put on the ""call in list."" She seemed very confused and immediately got her manager.  The manager then explained again the wait was 20 minutes. I let her know we called in, she then began to explain some odd process of the time they quote over the phone is really half the time of the actual wait in the restaurant.............. I tried to simplify the conversation ""what was the advantage of me calling ahead and being put on a call list if the walk in ahead of me is quoted the exact same amount of time I'm being quoted right now?"" She then re-explained the process of quoting half wait times over the phone. Anyhow, I think she completely missed the point I was making (or refused to acknowledge it). There was ZERO benefit of me calling ahead and being put on a ""list."" ""we're still a new location, they're learning, it's dinner time"" She then told me to wait ""25-30 minutes""  seriously??? incredible. Not dinner time for me apparently! Guess I better deal with this learning curve they're having :) This was actually my second visit. The first I was turned away entirely because they weren't officially open and I was told you needed a special reservation in advance. (no i didn't call ahead, maybe thats why I did this time!!) In any case, no I didn't expect to walk in and be seated immediately, it's BJs, always busy. I've been to oakridge, been to fremont. I go quite often actually,. but to quote me the exact same or MORE time and to take zero action to make it right? Even make excuses implying that I misunderstood? Incredibly lousy service best part was the manager seemed surprised we weren't going to wait based on the experience. would you???

350,Dmitriy S.,"Santa Clara, CA",293,905,2950.0,3.0,2013-10-10,"I tend to stay away from places like BJ's, Applebee's, Chili's, etc when there's so many better options in one of the most diverse melting pots in the world. However, when Kathleen W. invited me for happy hour at the end of a tumultuous week, how could I say no? We came when this BJ's had only been open for a week. It was already packed with customers, had a line out the door, and is so huge that it took me a bit of walking to find my friends.  Here's how Happy Hour works. Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm, Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close:  - $4 beers, call drinks, and simple appetizers - $5 mojitos, martinis, and more sophisticated appetizers - $6 wine and the fanciest appetizers I started off with their Oktoberfest (seasonal) beer, which is a toasty lager. Very smooth, crisp and refreshing. Later in the night, I got a Nutty Brewnette. A bit too nutty and strong for my taste, but still quite decent. The quality of their beer surprised me. Appetizers: - Avacado Egg Rolls ($6): Avacado, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, and spices in wonton wrapping. The ones we were served pretty much just had avocado and omitted most of the items listed above. It was bland, but fresh. Wouldn't recommend. - California Club Flatbread ($4): Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic aioli and avocado on a flatbread. Pretty tasty with a good amount of chicken. Not too overbaked, and the garlic aioli adds a nice flavor you usually don't expect on a pizza.  - Mini Vegetarian/Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizzas ($6): Your typical veggie deep dish pizza, with the buffalo one being the same but with chicken. It's actually not really ""deep dish,"" in the sense that the extra height is taken up by the dough, not by more ingredients. Pretty decent but nothing to rave about.  - Chicken Lettuce Wrap ($6): Diced chicken breast, mushroom, water chestnuts, veggies and crispy wontons served with lettuce cups and sauces. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. The lettuce was crisp and fresh. When combined with the sesame soy sauce, it was a fantastic flavor concoction. Definitely recommend.  This was all finished off with the much needed Pizookie Trio. Not sure which pizookies we got, but they all lived up to the hype. A perfect way to pig out one last time during the evening.  Service is very slow, but that's understandable considering they're new and are packed during happy hour. Once they get on their feet, they'll probably hire more wait staff. My friend's beer took half an hour to arrive and they kept making excuses. Eventually, he just got it for free, which was nice of them, but expected from us.  Overall, a great place for happy hour, but I wouldn't come here for a full meal. That's just personal preference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=340,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

It wasn't too busy since this location has only been opened for less than a month but it's like any other average BJ's. Tips: On Thursdays selected beers are $3.50 instead of $4. Even though the bar area is ONLY for happy hour crowd, if you get the manager's approval, you can have hh prices at the tables (not too much food selection for hh and there won't be a menu at the tables either for what's on hh). Shots are like $10 so just get two $5 mojitos instead or 3 beers. If you're looking to watch the game, make sure you sit at a table that's in SIGHT of a TV. ALWAYS end your night with a pazookie.

The staff were obviously not fully comfortable at this new location....awkward vibe during seating. Ok... Our server (he never said his name) came over took our order for 3 sodas, 1 beer and 2 appetizers and returned about 5 minutes later with the sodas & no beer. Said the beer would be right out. He returned 5 minutes later to take our order and still no beer (at which point I asked about it and he said it would be right out) 5 minutes later he returned with 4 plates for our apps and the beer. We then placed our order for our main dishes. Quick & easy (we have been to BJs many times before - love the one at Oakridge, HATE the one in Cupertino near Apple). 10 minutes later he returned with a stand for the pizza we ordered and it was wet and had previous pizza all over it (I seriously gagged). 5 minutes later (25 minutes after we arrived) a female server (Stephanie) came over and informed us she was taking over for the guy (he was off and had gone home). I asked her to get us a new pizza stand and when she returned with it she informed us that she was aware that our apps had been put in 20 minutes before and she would bring them out ASAP and a manager would be over to talk with us about that. I told her the manager didn't need to come over, we were happy she was taking over.  1 appetizer came out and while eating it part of my main meal order came out! Not happy:( About 5 (or more) minutes later the second appetizer came out. Rest of the meal came out pretty quickly after that. Food was good, although my daughter's pasta (she orders all the time) was under seasoned. Sodas were refilled frequently without having to ask. I ordered a 2nd beer which took at least 10 minutes (from the time I started looking at the time), so the manager (fully aware of our experience at this point) comped that one.  Stephanie was a great server trying to clean up the mess the previous guy left her. As for the time it took the 2nd beer -- I am pretty sure that was fault of the bar.

And I love calamari, so I asked the manager if it was really calamari, little fried squid and he assured me it was. OK, I ordered. Then they tell me it will take about 15 minutes. What? That's like saying it will take 15 minutes to fry french fries. Why would it take so long.

Finally, they bring it out, and, there are only 4 little shriveled up little squids about the size of a quarter, and the rest is gristle and chucks of breaded bread saturated in grease, and some thin little onion-ring like things also greased and breaded. And the taste? Uggh. Disgusting.  So, of course I complain to the manger. ""Hey, there are only four little squids in this calamari order, the rest is little chunks of fried breaded bread and breaded twigs. This is a rip off. You sold me 50 cents worth of calamari for over $10.00 bucks."" What does the manager do? He argues. ""But that's the way it comes in the package"" he says. ""Its only supposed to have a few calamari. Its supposed to have all that extra breaded stuff.""  Me: ""Its a rip off and I want my money back."" Manager: ""I can't do that."" Bottom line: No thanks.

"" (?)  I explained how I had to get something at Target before they closed (it was a Sunday and they closed earlier than during the week).  After being told that we could potentially have to wait an extra 30 minutes before being seated, I didn't want to risk having to rush through our meal, so we could make it to Target before they closed.  One person from the party stayed with the pager.  Literally the second I walked out the door, to run over to Target, the pager goes off.  How does a wait time go from being 30 mins to under 5 mins?  If the staff was trying to accommodate - they need to learn to not how to do so.  After getting the phone call saying the pager had gone off, while I was still in the parking lot, we decided to blow off BJ's.  I have worked in a quest service environment before.  I know how dealing with the public can be - it's not always easy.  Some guests just aren't pleasant.  This is EXACTLY why I never treat people who are assisting me poorly, unless it's deserved.  The fact that we were treated the way we were was absurd.  The ""Bon Qui Qui"" ghetto attitude needed to be checked at the door before coming to work.  These people at the podium are the first point of contact for the BJ's brand/experience.  Management should be appalled that this played out the way it did.   We were initially excited that BJ's was going on at this shopping center - it's sad that it played out as it did.  Management really needs to weed out these type of employees.  These days, there is no excuse to hire such inexperienced and worthless individuals.  It's called professionalism.  Ya may not love your job BUT people need to learn to put the damn face on - you are being paid to represent a company.  No excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=660,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

You can't expect to taste anything exceptional here other than the already amazing pizookie.  Service-Spotty. They try at times. It blows my mind that people will walk into an establishment like this and expect over the top service. This isn't Gary Danko, they focus on volume.

551,Wesley R.,"Santa Clara, CA",17,6,,2.0,2013-10-28,"I'm giving them 2 stars only because the food was pretty good and our server tried to serve us the best she could. I had a birthday dinner here last night with 12 friends. I called in 3 whole weeks prior to make a reservation. I called the night before just to make sure that they had my reservation and to let them know I would be coming. At first they couldn't find my reservation, this was foreshadowing what would eventually happen. I got there on time for my reservation and was told it would take about 20 minutes for another large party to leave. This was fine as people from my party were still showing up. However, after 45 minutes of waiting it got a bit ridiculous. I was then told that there was no room inside for a party of my size, and the other large party had just gotten their food. The only option they had was for us to sit outside. We chose to sit outside in the chilly weather. The heaters could only do so much with how cold it was outside. Our server was nice but she was being run around too. She wasn't supposed to be waiting tables outside and was running back and forth. The food runners kept bringing food to our table that we hadn't ordered, it was for other tables elsewhere. The food took a long time to come but it was pretty good. Our server had to take a break right in the middle of our evening and we were switched to another server. Later on, our original server returned. Afterwards we ordered pizookies and those took forever to come. They messed up the pizookie orders and forgot about one of them. By this time, it was 3 hours after people were told to arrive, everyone was freezing, food runners kept bringing food and drinks to our table that we hadn't ordered, everyone just wanted to leave, but we were waiting on a pizookie we had ordered that they forgot about. People were getting impatient and frustrated. We finally got out of there but it was such a bad experience that I will not be going back anytime soon. The management really needs to get their act together because the service was terrible overall and nobody knows what's going on. If somebody makes a reservation 3 weeks in advance, you must be able to accommodate that party!

I've been three separate times, had three different servers, and had three bad experiences. See rant below... First time we tried the call ahead list, but still waited 45 minutes once we got there. Service was okay- it was obvious she was new, but she was trying. Second time, we found an empty table in the bar right away, but our server was horrible. She was way too quiet for the loud atmosphere, didn't know anything about the food, and would ask a question but not wait for an answer- which meant we had to ask multiple times for sauces/drinks/etc- making her go back and forth, wasting even more time.  My third and final visit was the worst experience yet. Another super long wait, only to wait again at the hostess stand after our buzzer went off. This wouldn't have been an issue had there not been 5 employees just standing around behind the stand talking and not paying attention to their busy lobby. Once we FINALLY got seated, the server took forever. I'm not even talking about the food wait time, cause I know that can take awhile on a busy night, I'm talking about not even stopping by to greet us for at least 15 minutes. Then she completely forgot to bring our drinks (we had to ask the food runner who brought our salads out), and then she took another 20 minutes to bring us refills later on in the meal. It's not that hard to drop off a soda or glass of water... you can't control the kitchen, but you can at least make sure your tables aren't thirsty! I expected there to be kinks because this is a new location and there are probably a lot of new employees, but it's worse than I imagined. Their employees are unprofessional- standing in groups talking, walking in front of/cutting off guests, forgetting orders, saying inappropriate things, and just generally not paying attention. The managers really need to get their act together and start weeding out the people who don't deserve to be there. Wait time when it's busy is forgivable, but nothing else is.

What I find a bit ridiculous is that on a Wednesday night at 9pm in a half-full dining room with twice as many servers as necessary, a meal will take you 3 hours to complete. Not joking. Exaggerating a little bit, but not joking.  Our waitress was nice, but frazzled. Seemed like she was new or something. It took her a very long time to come to our table, a long time for our drinks to come out, a long time before she took our food order, a long time to get the food, a long time to sit with an empty plate and empty glasses, a long time to get dessert, but a surprisingly short time to have the check picked up. To be fair, about 3/4 of the way through our meal she went on her lunch break and some other dude took over. He wasn't spectacular, but he at least refilled our water glasses.  Honestly though, the only actual positive thing I have to say is that pizooki's are flippin amazeballs.  To sum up, don't come on a Wednesday night at 9pm if you are in a hurry. Order early, drink beer (it makes the waiting MUCH less frustrating), eat dessert, pay the check and leave.

The food is consistently decent and the service is hit or miss there, usually miss. I was really excited that they opened a location in San Jose but waited to go there due to all the bad reviews, especially long wait times and service. Last Sunday night, it was late and we had not had dinner yet or gone food shopping in a few days. Normally I would have gone to some divey taqueria but we have a baby now so off to BJ's it was. We were seated at a table by the side door opening onto the patio, which a server was leaning against to chat with some others servers smoking outside on their break. Cold air and cigarette smoke is not what I prefer for my baby so we asked to move. Our server was very sweet and helpful.  As for the food, I was very disappointed by the mozzarella sticks, which I've ordered at least a dozen times at the other location. They were very dry, like if you open a box of frozen mozzarella sticks and then have it in freezer for too long and then try to cook them. I also hate that they always give you this dinky little thing of marinara sauce that is never enough for all the mozzarella sticks. I've asked for extra sauce when I order but they always forget. WAHHH! I also love their clam chowder but it is way too salty now. The only thing I enjoyed were the thai shrimp wraps which were delicious but extremely messy to eat. My other favorite is the potstickers. Come to think of it, the Asian inspired selections are all much better than the rest of the food lol. All in all, this is a chill place to come hang out and have a beer with friends.

A waiter then asked if we had been contacted and took our drink orders for us. When taking our food orders he cut us off several times. This lead to issues with our order. Once the orders came out my wife's was totally wrong. The person who brought it just walked away when we said something. The waiter came back and made an excuse for the mistake.

We were seated quickly and our sever came right over. We ordered the soup and salad with a calamari appetizer. The calamari arrived within five minutes and was VERY good, nice and crispy, with a great flavor. The wedge salad was typical and also very good. The GF had the chicken tortilla soup and she said it was delicious. I had the chili and I must say, it was the best restaurant chili I've ever eaten. I also ordered an Imperial Stout from the beer menu and it was excellent! The service was great, and the food was great. We really enjoyed ourselves. Why not five stars? Well,  I took a half-star for the noise level, it is just under the unbearable range for me. Another half-star was deducted because of children in the vicinity.

636,Casey N.,"Aptos Hills-Larkin Valley, CA",25,168,,2.0,2013-12-04,"Had a late dinner last night at BJ's because it was convenient and open late.   I'm completely in agreement with the other 1 and 2 star reviews who cited the service as being awful.  Wow.. we were just amazed how lousy it was.  From the moment we walked in to leaving an hour and a half later, it got progressively worse. When I walked in, I was completely ignored by the hostess. In fact, instead of making any eye contact as I walked in and stood in front of her at the reception desk, she walked away for a few minutes without a word to chat and laugh with a server.  When she returned, she did not greet me, never smiled, was really unhelpful, then mumbled something, and was annoyed when I asked her to repeat herself.  Even though the restaurant was maybe 20% (at most) filled with diners, she told me to take a seat and someone would take me to the table.  I was fine waiting since the others I was meeting hadn't arrived, but thought it was odd.  I'm now trying to give more benefit of the doubt to people in customer service if they have a bad day, so I tried to shake her attitude off and tell myself that she must be having personal problems. Once seated at the table, the server did not check in for nearly 10 minutes.  He was very nice, but distracted - I ordered iced tea and water and he then asked if I wanted anything to drink.  It took many minutes for the beverages to be delivered.  When my party arrived, it took several minutes for him to come back and ask them for their beverage orders.  Just periods of looooonnnnggg delays between sightings of the waiter and his return.  When we were ready to order, he brought over another server and said he was leaving on break and she would be taking care of us.  She also seemed very nice, took our order by memory, and then disappeared for a long time.  Expediters delivered our salads 10 to 15 minutes after we ordered, and then brought out our entrees a couple of minutes later.  No ""do you want an extra plate since you're splitting"" or ""would you like some steak sauce"" or ""would you like a steak knife"" or ""can I bring you more water or iced tea""?  We flagged down our server several minutes later to ask for steak knives, an extra plate, more water, etc.  Again..... long delay.  Used the salad plate as the extra plate and sawed through the steak to divide it with a regular knife. The meals were okay.  Our wedge salads were funny.  A little slice of iceburg lettuce with some very sweet blue cheese dressing, perhaps a 1/2 teaspoon or less of crumbled bacon, and 5 tiny chunks of tomato.  The sirloin steaks were prepared perfectly, but the vegetables were tasteless and hard.  They had a special that included a lobster tail with the steak, so we ordered that and the tail was fairly small (to be expected for the price) and seasoned with curry.  I didn't mind, but it was a bit odd. When we were finished, our empty plates (salad and dinner) were all over the table and our water and iced tea glasses empty.  Even when the server came back eventually to ask if we wanted dessert, she nor anyone else picked up the plates. We paid the bill and left without anything being removed from the table.  When leaving, there were two ladies at the hostess station.  Neither said ""thanks for coming"" or ""drop dead.""  For a chain restaurant that competes for business with others in the area, I would expect that they would have some type of training and customer service standards?  I was just pissed by the time we left.    Prices were reasonable and BJ's definitely has a wide variety of items on their menu.  We read that Tuesdays are 1/2 off wine night, and they offer some very nice wines!  I would prefer not to give my money to this restaurant after our experience.  We've been to the BJ's in Cupertino a few years ago and enjoyed it.  This was nothing like that experience. I'm being very generous with the 2 stars, hoping they get their act together. But, actually and somewhat sadly, I couldn't care less whether this restaurant is successful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=740,2.48,2.48,2.48,1.864,2.48

Usually BJ's is pretty legit. Oh geez where do I start!  Well we walk in for a weekday lunch. We were ""seated"" ""immediately"". I say ""immediately"" because yes we didn't have to wait but we did have to walk through a jungle of bags and chairs. The row was too small while on the other side of the island table there was ample room. The employees I guess didn't measure the aisles before seating a group of 20+ people. Thought it was some what of a fire hazard. Anyways, I say ""seated"" because the hostess knew we were a party of 2 yet when we got to our table it was occupied by a group. She looked at us confused then asked if we were in that group. We said no and I suggested to her that there's an open booth behind us, can we just sit there? She said, ""Sure I think"" and sat us down.  After that weird interaction we meet our waitress and she was great. I had no complaints about her. I ordered the strawberry patch mixed drink. It had fresh cut strawberries with grey goose and other stuff. A truly girly drink. But oh so good. I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, yet felt good after drinking it. No complaints about the bartenders. While waiting for our food a waiter dropped and broke a few plates in front of us. Had nothing to do with us, just had to add that in. We ordered the calamari for our app. My husband asked me, ""How do you like the lukewarm calamari?"" Which pretty much sums up how we felt about our appetizer. Some of it was kind of warm and some were actually cold. Then came our small deep dish Mediterranean pizza. The guy who brought it out asked if we'd like anything else. So we ordered some ranch dressing. After waiting 15 minutes for the ranch to come out and seeing the guy walk past us 3 times since, I figured that was a no on the ranch. So I started to eat the pizza then. It tasted great, no complaints.  So to sum it up, service is the big issue! I think I'll wait some time until I visit again.

AND i didn't know you could have 3 free beer samples at BJs! I've never been told that! So that was a plus.

The negatives are for the food quality. My sliders (2 on the plate for $6 + potato wedges and a few pickles on salad) were pretty overgreased and there was barely anything inside. Their potato wedges were great but still didn't make up for the overly-greased sliders. And my friend had the happyhour menu wings and there were literally like 5 pieces. I mean I know it's cheap and it's happy hour but ~5 pieces?! dang... that's just sad. The one plus for food was their mini pizza which was also $6. that one was pretty good in size (personal pizza size) and tasty.  But I will be back! Because I can't say no to their beers.

As soon as they dropped off my order of Moroccan Spiced Salmon, my jaw dropped.  You're kidding me right?  I saw 2 nuggets of fish and what was supposed to be roasted vegetable couscous looked more like someone dropped my plate on the floor and put the remains back onto my plate.  Are you serious?

Funny how BJ's is now back in my life now that they've opened up a couple here in the South Bay Area.  This BJ's is pretty much brand new so I think they really wanna do their best right now to impress their customers. We came in for a quick bite to eat one weekend afternoon and surprisingly was able to get seated right away without a wait (you can't get that at any Cheesecake Factory or Yardhouse in this area). I really liked our server. He was extremely attentive and on point. To be honest, he looked like he could have been working as an engineer somewhere nearby at a software company or something. Kid looked smart! :P I ordered myself just appetizers with a nice glass of...water! Didn't wanna start drinking in the middle of the day if I was already going out later that night. I really liked the Thai shrimp wraps I ordered. But I especially loved the corn fritters with bacon aioli! OMG! Anything with corn...I'd die for! Delicious! I had no room for a nice individual-sized pizookie for myself for dessert.

386,Mike P.,"San Jose, CA",127,286,309.0,1.0,2013-12-19,"THIS IS FOR TAKE-OUT.  I understand that the quality of take-out from a chain is usually worse than dining in, especially at an American chain restaurant, so take EVERYTHING I say with a grain of salt.  That being said... My first 1-star review!  I don't usually write a review the day-of unless it's truly memorable (or something I should remember), but since I am currently curled up in a fetal position because BJ's destroyed my insides and it hurts to move, I might as well just go for it.   We ordered online.  I got the black-and-bleu (bacon, bleu cheese, garlic aoili) burger with thin cut fries.  My coworkers got the steak, 2 pizzas, and a chocolate chip pizookie.  Things they could have improved on: 1.) Not putting the fries inside the container, so when they arrive they are not soggy from the heat condensation.  They could at least put them in a bag or something.   Ditto applies to the burger bun.  I don't care how much parmesean you fry onto the bun if it's still soggy.  Soggy buns might be even worse than soggy fries, because you can't NOT eat a burger bun.  That being said, I ate everything; something I would regret.   2.) Don't overcook our steak, please.  ""Medium rare"" does not mean charcoal.  Admittedly, it was their mistake, because whenever you order steak from non-steakhouses, you should always order a doneness level below what you want, but going from medium rare to inedible-charcoal-covered-meat-nugget is a pretty unacceptable.  I know this, because I tried it, and it was like eating a lump of squishy coal.  I would later regret this.  Do you see where this is going?   3.) Check our order before you send us off on our way.  They forgot our pizookie.  THE SIGNATURE ITEM OF BJ'S!   HOW CAN YOU FORGET IT?  It's even wrapped in gaudy-ass aluminum pie mold!    So we called back, asked for our pizookie, and for a non-rare steak, and, much to my surprise, they agreed to give it back to us!  Nice one, management!  That being said, when my boss went to pick it up, three ladies were chatting outside, and it took five minutes before they noticed that she was waiting for our replacement order.  So... not so great, management.    But the coup de grace is really the fact that I am curled up in a ball, a full five hours after I have eaten, sick as a dog.  I don't know whether it was the soggy, greasy fries that I ate, the bleu cheese and garlic aoili that simmered in their plastic containers, my foolish sampling of the overcooked charcoalsteak, or all of the above, but I feel like DEATH.  Food is supposed to bring me joy; thank you, BJ's, for taking that away from me.   We did get a kick out of making ""dry BJ's"" jokes though.  So thanks for that, I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=380,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.7320000000000002,2.2

And then there's the $10 Margarita - this drink was so bad that even after diluting it 50% with water, it was unbearably sweet.

She was attentive and friendly, despite serving a somewhat drunk, rowdy party of 10. She had even given a few of us free root beers and cream sodas! This being the result of her assuming that we'd be finished with our first glass (unlimited refills for whomever ordered their handcrafted sodas). My hat is off to Shelby for being an amazing waitress. Onward to the food. One thing I dislike most is chain restaurant food. Ugh. Because this was a special occasion and the fact that I was absolutely starving, I sucked it up and forced myself to order and ingest the over-priced, average/sub-par tasting dishes. I proceeded to order the ""Grilled Burger Melt"" which came with the choice of either thin-cut crispy or wedge-cut fries; I opted for the thin-cut crispy. I asked for MEDIUM-RARE on my beef patty. I got an all brown-gray beef patty = WELL-DONE. You get a pass on that, Shelby. The burger wasn't that bad actually. I think if it had been cooked MEDIUM-RARE, I would've probably enjoyed it a lot more, but average as predicted. Same goes for the appetizers: fried calamari and lettuce wraps. All average, possibly worse. The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice, but I wouldn't suggest coming here unless it was an option for a ""last-resort for someone's birthday with a party of five or more"" kind of thing or perhaps a ""late-night get together and let's grab some brews and watch sports"" kind of thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=460,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.0280000000000005,2.28

BJs being a chain ... it just doesn't make sense for the newer location to be worse .. If anything, it should be at least as good as or better than its predecessors. The reviews I have been reading are mad horrible though.  We ended up having a party of about 10-12. Took about a 30 minute wait because i did not make any reservations (I didn't think it was necessary based on the reviews). Ordered some drinks right when we got seated. Snake Bites, Buffalo Bites, their in house brews, etc... It was all good. Got our appetizers which was mainly calamari, sliders, and avocado eggrolls. Everything was as expected based off my experiences at other BJs. Nothing new. The pizookie's are always great. I thank god they did not ruin the pizookie..

I always enjoy a pint of their Nutty Brunette and a pizookie if there's room in my belly! This time we ordered their mini pizookie trio (peanut butter, chocolate chunk, and red velvet). The chocolate chunk is the best, in my opinion, and going forward I will not order any other flavors. Unless of course we get the giant cookie that feeds a small village!  Other meals enjoyed at our last trip: their ribs were excellent, the black n blue flat bread pizza was okay, the buffalo chicken tenders were really good, and my brother liked their Snake Bite (guiness and apple cider).  The location is new and our server Tim was really new, but he was super friendly and tried really hard to make sure we were happy. I can't say anything bad about his service because he was running multiple tables, so I know he was busy. As long as he keeps up his can-do attitude, in a couple months he'll be the perfect server! We dined on a Friday night around 8pm and there was still an hour wait! Instead, we opted to sit outside (read: cold).

Hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area and we said okay, and just told us to sit where ever. We got a booth seat by the bar. I assumed this was part of the bar area because it was in the general area, but no wait staff came and greeted us or gave us menus. Keep in mind, it was 8:30PM on a Monday night... they weren't exactly busy. After 10 minutes, I finally walked up to the bar and asked for two menus. 8 minutes after that, a wait staff finally came around. She took our order. I ordered a soup and salad and asked specifically to hold the bleu cheese. Hubby ordered an ahi-tuna salad and a beer. We shared an avocado roll appetizer. My soup and salad came first. Nobody gave us utensils so we sat there for a good 5 minutes, until our waitress finally came around with utensils (she was apologetic). My salad was covered with bleu cheese. I didn't want to make a fuss so I just grumpily ate the gross cheese while drenching my salad in honey mustard. I ate for about 25 minutes while my husband waited for his ahi-tuna salad. Finally, we told the waitress that we'd been waiting forever for his salad. She was apologetic (again) and rushed in and brought out the salad. It must have been sitting in the kitchen for the past 15 minutes and no one bothered to bring it out. Last time something like this happened at the Cupertino BJ's, they comped the dish. Didn't do it here (not that we were looking for it, but it's a testament to their service). Also didn't help that the waitress at the table behind us seemed to know the diners sitting behind us. She kept coming back to them and chatting about personal stuff while lingering around. When it came to get the check, our waitress was nowhere to be found for 10 minutes. Ugh, so frustrating.

It was an hour wait on tables to sit inside. Luckily the night we went it was nice and not too cold outside. We were able to sit outside under the heat lamps. Really nice patio furniture they had.  On to the experience. A couple of my friends got seated before I came. One of them ordered a drink. The drink was a cocktail and was delivered with no straw..uhh ok. She asked the waitress for a straw when the waitress took our order. After she left about 10 minutes later..still no straw. It was almost like straw-gate. Where have all the straws gone? We had to waive down another person who was delivering food to another table. She gave us a straw finally, a kids straw, one that bends. We all had a good laugh about it. As usual I never had an issue with BJ's food and im a sucker for their flatbred pizza. They have changed the happy hour menu to now have $4, $5, and $6 deals instead of previous happy hour menu. One of my friends ordered calamari as an app. We all got our food. His entree came out before the calamari and we were like no worries, we can still eat it! Sadly the calamari never came. When we asked about it they said they go check on it. 15 minutes later we had to waive another person down to go check on it.

Around 10min later, a different hostess comes by to tell us that our table was ready, so we all follow her and get settled at the table, only to find another large party standing behind us getting irritated because they said the hostess was supposed to seat their party instead of ours. So up we go again back to the lobby to wait for them to put together another table large enough to accompany us.

Waiting impatiently does not make me or time go any faster. The one star is for her separating all of our checks.

I had to use HORSERADISH to mellow out the sodium. And had it not been for those thin fries I would have gone hungry.

When we told this to the waiter, he stated that the wait is so long because they make their burgers fresh from the best ingredients. It sure didn't taste that way. I give that burger a 3/10.

We were shifted through 3 waitress.  I can understand the long wait on long weekend but when we got seated it took quite some time to take our orders. The waitress was so much in hurry that did not bother to ask how we want my burger then when the food came out it was cold. It was quickly put on table and then there was no one to bring any of the condiments we waited for 5-7 minutes had to go search for some one to ask to bring the normal condiments. By the time food was so much more cold. We had to remind the waitress for our beer order which took another 5-7 minutes after reminder. I asked for glass of water and then waitress again forgot to bring it to table. I wonder if they are keeping up to good standard or just going down now.

669,Renee N.,"San Jose, CA",107,63,26.0,3.0,2014-02-23,"Overall, a good solid restaurant but nothing fancy.  Pros: + Minimal wait time. Maybe it's because this place is still new, but it's never been really hard to get a table, including times I've come here on a Friday night with no reservation. The longest I've had to wait for a table was about 7 minutes.  + Good food. Food is not top-of-the-line, but it's pretty good. I personally love the baked potatoes, which they seem to only list on the lunch menu now. I've actually heard other people ask what happened to the baked potatoes during the dinner hour, so I know I'm not the only one who misses them. However, if you ask for a baked potato for dinner, they'll totally hook you up.  + Friendly wait staff. Everyone I've interacted with at BJ's has been very friendly and helpful.  Cons: - Some tables are very drafty. Twice when I've come here, they've sat me in a very drafty section near the wall. It honestly feels like you're outside and there's a cold breeze blowing in your face. I put up with it the first time, but the second time I asked to be moved. I noticed that the people they sat at the table after we moved also asked to change tables, and the waitress later told us all the tables along the wall had a draft problem. Hopefully someone fixes this!! - Don't come here for brunch. I really shouldn't hold this against them too much - this isn't a brunch place.

We then ordered our drinks and entrees. He came with our water and soda at a reasonable time but I waited for my pumpkin beer for a long time.

650,Carol R.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,,2.0,2014-02-24,"First I have to say we usually really like BJs as a chain, and we were super excited to find one opening just a few miles from where we live in San Jose..at previous BJs the food is usually consistently good, the atmosphere and lighting is very nice, great real sodas and excellent beer.  Unfortunately, in THIS newly opened BJs, we've not experienced what we are used to at BJs.  It looks the same (atmosphere/lighting) but the service leaves a lot to be desired.    Since they opened, we've been there at least  6 times...each time we've experienced slow service, and very long wait times for ordering a 2nd round of drinks.   The wait-staff seem to be quite inexperienced, but most have been reasonably pleasant.  Our most recent experience 5 of us were at a table in the bar.   When the waiter finally noticed us and came over to take our order, he could not tell us if happy hour was still in process or not, so we couldn't tell what to order (this despite the happy hour menu on the table and the fact that if there is a game playing - there was - in the past, BJs has called that happy hour) -- so it took him some time to find a manager to determine if happy hour was still ""on"" (it wasn't) -- took ages to get the first round of drinks. . we ordered a 2nd round ...[place was only about 40% full] - for ages our waiter kept walking past our table delivering drinks to others all around us.   After about 20 minutes we flagged him down.  He looked annoyed and said, ""we're out of glasses .. as soon as the kitchen has some clean ones I can bring  your drinks.."" -- and he walked away.  We sat there staring at the clean wine glasses and little wine carafes sitting and hanging above the bar,  watching the bartender pour a martini into a glass for someone who had just ordered one.  I would have  pointed out that we had a set of empty glasses on our TABLE and perhaps if the waiter TOOK THOSE BACK to the bar they'd be able to use those   But no - -the waiter had walked off (after us also telling him that we'd like to order some food).   [Really I don't know why I'm not giving this place 1 star, except I am reserving the 1 star rating ""standard"" for the Worst Dining Experience Ever that we had a few weeks ago in Japantown at Wings. . . and this experience was NOWHERE NEAR as bad as that!] Anyway - I asked to speak to the manager.   The ""manager"" was really out of his depth - didn't seem to know what to do or how to handle the situation.  Got a lot of canned, ""I understand can I do anything ELSE for you?"" (you know  - that passive aggressive sugary question that requires the complaining customer to answer in the affirmative as though everything is all right when it's not..) -- we finally got our drinks . . but the waiter never returned to take a food order.  The manager, out of the blue, said he'd ""ordered some complimentary appetizers"" for us, which was certainly an effort to do something to make up for the bad service/waiter's snarky attitude, but we didn't WANT appetizers  - we wanted to order a meal (which we were not expecting to be given to us free) - and instead of giving us a choice of what we wanted to order, a random selection of fried items appeared on our table. When they first opened I chalked up this sort of experience to a green staff, a newly opened facility etc., - but honestly, it's not getting better and they've been open a while now.   They need to train their wait staff and get some experienced managers in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=760,2.16,2.23,2.23,1.8960000000000001,2.2020000000000004
532,Allison R.,"Santa Clara, CA",49,161,52.0,1.0,2014-02-24,"I've been to many BJ's locations, and am typically a big fan (as far as big chain restaurants go anyway). This was my first visit to this location, because I was meeting my parents for dinner before they were going to the airport nearby. Let's just say, I will not be recommending this location to anyone based on our service experience. I'm not sure if our server was new, or maybe he was having an off night, but regardless of the reason, we didn't leave very happy. First tip something was off, my mom asked him if they had brown rice that she could substitute for white rice. He looked at her funny and then said ""oh ya, we've got rice pilaf that is kinda brown..."" Ummmm, seriously? This guy didn't know what brown rice was.  Then, I ordered a gluten free pizza with Italian sausage, fire roasted red bell peppers, and basil. The server asked me ""oh, so you want me to bring you a side of those hot pepper flakes?"" That's what he thought fire roasted red bell peppers were (which is an item listed right on the menu). I explained to him what I meant (even pointing to the item on the menu), and he seemed to understand.  After we all finished ordering, my mom said ""Wow, impressive! He didn't write any of that down."" I made the comment to her that we'd have to see how impressive it actually is once we get our orders. Sure enough, my pizza was wrong. My pizza had green bell peppers, and no basil (which I don't fault the server for too much, for some reason the basil is missing almost every single time I order pizza from any BJ's location). I was going to just eat the pizza I was given because I'm not that picky, but my mom was not happy. Besides, she is right; we should get the meal we order when we're paying customers. When I told the server my order was wrong because there were green bell peppers, not the fire roasted red bell peppers I ordered, and it was missing basil, his response to me was ""those are the only bell peppers we have"". I explained to him that I order this exact same pizza every time I come to BJ's (which is a true statement, I have been getting that same combo for years at various locations), and the fire roasted red bell peppers is an item listed on the menu. He was also defensive about the basil and said he put that on the order. Like I said earlier, the basil is often forgotten, and I know he didn't MAKE the pizza, but he should've checked to make sure it was correct before bringing it out. He took the pizza and said he'd go check. Sure enough, he came back and said I was right, they do have fire roasted red bell peppers. He did apologize for his mistake, and offered me a free gluten free Pizookie or a free salad so that I didn't have to sit there without food while my new pizza was being made. I didn't really want either, but he was still holding the wrongly-made pizza, so I asked if I could just have that one to go instead. He said that was ok, and brought it back to me in a box.  I got my correct pizza (basil and all) a little while later and it was piping hot, fresh out of the oven & it was delicious.  When the server brought the check over, he apologized for the delay and said he had to have his manager take off the charge for the second pizza...good thing he did that before he brought it to us or he would have gotten quite an earful from my mom... It was very nice that he allowed me to take the incorrect pizza order to-go after I didn't want either of the choices he offered to make up for his mistake. But, it doesn't really make up for the fact that he wasn't knowledgeable about the menu (or even food for that matter...rice pilaf is NOT the same as brown rice buddy).

We didn't have enough spoons with our dessert, and had to ask several times for more. I would go to one of the other BJs in the area as they have far better service.

540,Alexandra G.,"Milpitas, CA",73,216,136.0,2.0,2014-03-05,The only reason they get two stars is their soup and salad combo has wedge salad and clam chowder. Their wedge salad is not as good as outback. Their bleu cheese dressing is on the thinner side but it is not terrible. Their clam chowder is almost always very good. I say almost because a few times I've sent it back to be heated a bit more. I like my soup hot. Their service lacks for sure. At first I let it slide because they just opened and half the people probably lied on their application when it came to the serving part. But it has been a few months and still no improvement.  Their kids pizza is awful don't waste your money. The crust is often burnt and stale. There is no sauce. They give maybe four pepperonis.

When it did, my pizza was cold but I was so starving by then so I forced it down. My friend asked for no veggies in her teriyaki chicken which, of course, came with veggies.

160,John D.,"San Jose, CA",100,545,13815.0,1.0,2014-03-09,"My really good friend just received a big promotion at work so he wanted to celebrate; my family was invited along with another couple to join him and his wife for drinks and dinner there on a Saturday night. I had tremendous reservations coming here because I had seen the Yelp reviews on the bad service, but my buddy wanted to come check it out because it was new -- far be it from me to piss in anyone's Cheerios. I'm not fan of chain restaurants in general but BJ's I can usually tolerate because they actually have great beer and decent enough burgers that I can justify going there in my head. Well, unfortunately the night didn't turn out so well. Which means I have to break out with another rendition of JD's ""The Good, The Bad, & The  Ugly""!! *crowd cheers* The Good: -The Beer at BJ's is always solid. Everyone enjoyed their beers and my wife was loving her Skinny Rita. -A couple of the ladies split a ""thin-crust"" pizza and seemed to enjoy it; I use the term ""thin-crust"" here very loosely because I've seen thinner crusts at the Grand Canyon. *rim shot* -The Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli were actually pretty good. I'd order them again. -The company we had at the table was great! Everyone was having a great time laughing and telling stories. At one point my 3-year-old was entertaining us with his rendition of Chamillionaire's ""Ridin' Dirty"" (It's a long story--don't ask). Yeah, I know, technically BJ's didn't provide the good company, but I'm trying to stay positive here, OK? The Bad: -I ordered the California Burger *medium-rare* with their wedge-cut fries. The burger came out well-done and the sourdough bread was charred to the point that I felt like I was eating charcoal. Also, the fries were served cold, and that's just inexcusable for a place that's as busy as they are. The Ugly: -My wife ordered the Honey Lime Seared Scallops and it was truly, truly awful. The brown rice it came with was gummy and the scallops themselves were over-cooked and still had sand on them. Yes, sand! I wouldn't have believed it if my wife hadn't forced me to try them. I took a bite and sure enough there it was: the taste of the ocean you don't want. On the positive side, at least I got some fiber out of it. This dish was so bad that it actually prompted her to go speak with the manager and get the dish comped; first time she's done this in the 13+years I've known her! -The service really is as atrocious as advertised; I feel bad because our main server (whose name I forget) really seemed to be trying hard but I get the feeling that he's just surrounded by incompetence. Here's a list of their wrongdoings:   1) We ordered 3 appetizers to share: the Best Beginnings, Corn Fritters and Boneless Buffalo Wings. The first two came out after 20-minutes and the wings didn't arrive until everyone was half-way through their dinner. We were supposed to get the wings comped as well (Yay, wifey!) but they ended up comping us the fritters which was a $4 savings on their end. 2) Service was slow and spotty. They seemed amply staffed so I'm not sure what's the issue. It would take over 10-minutes for people to get a beer; at one point this one waitress comes over and hands someone a beer and says, ""I don't know what this is.Taste it and tell me if it's the right one"" Seriously?! Hey, wait-a-minute! Is that Allen Funt over there? 3) My wife and my buddy's wife both ordered side salads with their meals. Neither received them and yet we were charged for them anyways. We didn't realize this until we were already well on our way home and by then you just want to wash your hands of the whole thing. I was trying to be positive about coming here and justified the bad reviews as maybe just growing pains for a new restaurant. However, they've already been open 4-5 months and that should be plenty of time to right the ship. I've been to the BJ's at Oakridge Mall a few times and their service has always been hit-and-miss. I suspect there's something deeper at the corporate level and they need to reassess their training program because whatever they're doing ain't working. Unfortunately, I'm sure BJ's Corporate could care less. The place was packed and there was a throng of people outside waiting to get in as we left. As long as there are people willing to put up with second-rate food, good beer and terrible service then they're more than happy to continue doing what they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=200,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.5720000000000003,2.2

768,John D.,"San Jose, CA",1,51,,1.0,2014-03-17,"I went here last Saturday for Lunch. I walked in the front door and the teenager at the front grunted something that sounded like 'hey.' as a greeting. I smiled and told him there were two of us and asked if we could sit outside. He grunted, 'sure, head that way' so we started walking toward the patio area and he said (audibly this time) 'uh, wait! I mean wait here.'  After a minute or so another teenager came up and asked us to follow her. As soon as we 'headed that way', teenager #1 grunted 'wait' again and came over to tell teenager #2 to go check with so-and-so to see if she wants more people or not. A couple of minutes later she came back, took us to the patio area and mumbled something. By this time I was fed up so instead of asking what she said, I chose a booth and sat down. She wandered off. Our waitress was polite and took our order after a few minutes. The only complaint I have about her is that she was never around when I wanted to talk to her. For example to order another beer when my first was finished.  I ordered a Cobb Salad and it came in good time but the person who brought it (not the waitress) handed it to me instead of putting it down on the table in front of me. That's the first time I have seen that one. It was almost like she was saying 'here, I don't know what to do with this, you figure it out.' The Cobb Salad looked fine but something wasn't quite right. After a few minutes I figured out that they had put the Caesar's anchovy dressing on it instead of the garlic dressing they had advertised.  By the time the waitress came back around and I mentioned it to her, she offered to make another one but it was too late since I had already eaten most of it and my mouth was coated with nasty fish taste so I had lost my appetite. The check came and it was $50 for two beers, a Cobb Salad with Anchovy Surprise, an appetizer pizza and a Root Beer. Not worth it at all. BTW I have to comment on the beer here: It is 'OK' and nothing special. The two different types I had were the IPA (flat and not very hoppy) and some kind of Scottish Ale they had on special (flat and the hops just didn't work with the malt - or maybe it was the anchovies...) I have been here before to try the beer and although I don't remember the specific ones I tried my opinion is a resounding 'meh'.

I was so excited to hear that  BJ's was opening up near my area since I die for their avocado rolls. SO DAMN GOOD. Went to this location TWICE and hey always ran out of it. Seriously? But that was not the most annoying part. My friends and I came here on another night and ordered rounds and rounds of appetizers and drinks. I could tell that they were getting a little irritated since they came by multiple times and asked if we were ready to order from the dinner menu, but we clearly told them that we were mainly going to get appetizers and drinks. Then, my boyfriend heard some of the waitresses BEHIND our table talking about us. They were saying things like ""Oh, why are they even here if they aren't going to order anything? They're taking up so much room."" First of all, there were absolutely NO other customers waiting to be seated. And secondly, our bill still came out to be over a fucking hundred dollars. OVER 100 and you're still complaining? They're lucky we even tipped them in the first place. I would have wanted to talk to their manager, but I didn't even know they were saying things about us until after we left the place.

696,Hazel L.,"San Jose, CA",219,28,38.0,2.0,2014-04-25,"This BJ's definitely lives up to their two-star rating! && I'm actually being a bit generous giving them two stars.. Food = decent. BUT WHY TWO STARS?! Because the service at this location sucks ass. If you want to make a reservation here, THINK OTHERWISE. I called Wednesday 4/23/14 to make a reservation and this girl answered. I told her my reason why I was calling & she put me on HOLD so she could get her manager to talk to me and set the reservation. I WAS ON HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES! Eventually my patience ran out & I decided to drive and make the reservation FACE-TO-FACE with the manager. I arrive to BJ's tell the hostess that I would like to set a reservation for my party consisting of 40 people & she had the nerve to say, ""Oh to make a reservation, you could have simply gave us a call and we'd be glad to help you.."" LIAR, I mean she only put me on hold for like 15 minutes right ?! GIRL BYE. ANYWAYS, so I speak with the manager Diana as she attempts to help me make a reservation. I asked her about the times that are available to accommodate 40 people since the Warriors/Sharks had a game that day too. She told me 9:30PM.. I was unsure myself if that was gonna be a good time  to reserve, BUT I took a risk and told her to put my name down as a reservation for 9:30PM/40 people party. I seen her write the reservation down on her reservation paper & I told her before I left ""IF MORE OR LESS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ATTEND, I WILL GIVE YOU A CALL""..  **DAY OF THE EVENT** My party of 40 and I arrive the day of the event around 9:20ish & tell the hostess that I have a reservation under my name for 40 people. With a confused look on her face she tells me ""No, we have a reservation down for 30 people.."" && I was thinking maybe there had to be a last minute change with the reservation, so the hostess just tells me and my party to take a seat and wait a few minutes.. We're waiting and waiting and waiting.. Another BIG group of people enter through and say they had a reservation at 9PM for 30 people. I'm here like WTF is going on.. We've waited almost an HOUR && that's when the Hostess tells us that there has been a mix up with reservations & they thought we were part of the other big party whose reservation was at 9PM. I tell the hostess that I set a reservation with Diana the day before & when they check their system my name doesn't pop up... A FEW MINUTES LATER WE FIND OUT THAT DIANA NEVER SET A RESERVATION FOR ME. Supposedly there was a miscommunication that I didn't tell her clearly I wanted a reservation, when I clearly MADE one the previous day stating to put my name down for 9:30PM. Instead of acting as a manager and apologizing for her mistake she was just ignoring me and trying to avoid eye contact. Some manager huh??? I had to restrain my rachetness and make sure I didn't go off on this manager.. BUT.. THANKFULLY one of the hostess.. I forgot her name, but she looked Latin, had braces, and had long curly hair came to the RESCUE! All she told me to do was count the amount of people in my party who were actually there and told me to WAIT A FEW MORE MINUTES. We were seated around 1050/55PM.. At that time PEOPLE WERE GETTING HANGRY, especially since the Warriors/Sharks lost that day too.. Usually for a big party of 25+ they have a set menu called ""Pizza Pairings"" where the people in the party pay per person if they want Pizza (12.95/person), Pizza/Salad(13.95/person), or Pizza/Salad/Pasta (14.95).. We ended up not ordering from that and just ordered from the regular menu. To serve my big ass party, I give the waitresses that served us KUDOS because they were on top of their game! They were efficient with the getting our drink/food orders and they always came back to make sure we were doing fine and letting us know when our food was ready.  As much as my guests and I were annoyed from the manager's mistake for my reservation, I definitely am grateful for the hostess and waitresses that made the event work out perfectly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=600,2.08,2.1,2.1,2.6640000000000006,2.092

Fortunately we had the pleasure of being served by Courtney, who recommended my entree AND ensured my girlfriends salmon would actually be blackened instead of the oddly seasoned fish we've had here twice before, and once overly raw. Accommodating is an understatement for the service we've received from Courtney tonight. Friendly, attentive, accurate and definitely worth returning.

We arrived at around 10 pm on a Monday, mostly empty in the dining area and moderately busy at the bar. We had a party of 10 so we had to wait for a table that could accommodate. When it was ready, our hostess rudely let us know with a ""'Kay, your table is ready"" and didn't even take us to the table; she just pointed to a table in the back that was barely big enough to accommodate us so we asked a different person if we could add another table, which we did. Our server was just as bad; she was inattentive and lacked urgency, that is until she realized she new one of our friends. She then continued to chat it up with him instead of helping us out. It took a while for us to order food and the food took just as long to come out as well, both meal and dessert, and drinks were left empty for long periods of time. A few of us were sharing food and our server was supposed to bring out plates, but that never happened as well.

Sorry, Shelby (if you are reading).  So, the food was really good. We ordered the fried calamari, Moroccan salmon, and Cherry Glazed Chipotle salmon. We both shared our food (like most girlfriends do) :) We both liked the Moroccan salmon more than the Chipotle salmon. The Moroccan salmon has a crunch to it while the other one doesn't. Since it's cherry glazed, it's sweet. So, it wasn't our favorite. Though the fried calamari portion is rather small, it's pretty good.  I also ordered the Orange Twist drink. It's a little too sweet for me, but it's orange-y. I like it :) Our order came out pretty quick. It was super crowded when we went there around 7:30pm on Thursday. But, the wait was not too long.

He looked at it then disappeared for 10-15 minutes to confirm the order was in the kitchen. He walked by but said nothing about the order being prepared which was odd.  30 minutes later, a manager came to our table to apologize for our order not being received!

I noticed that the large group was just now placing their orders and it did not look like we would be helped anytime soon. Well now its about 1230 and my daughter and I decide, we should get food to go because we wont have enough time if we sit here and wait.  We go to the take out order area that is unmanned, and wait again. We place our order and are told it may take some extra time because the kitchen is a little backed up! it is now 1240pm but we decide to wait. At this time I also ask to speak to the MOD who I am told is in the kitchen helping out.  I wait for her for about 7 mins and when she arrives she didn't apologize, offer anytype of service recovery incentive.   She simply asked what kind of pizza we had ordered and said she would speak to the staff.  I offered her the training opportunity advice of training your staff not to share the details of your poorly staffed and managed establishment and to instead thank the customer for their patience and offer them some gesture of  food or beverage. Even something as cheap as iced tea would calm people that are waiting. I did not need to know that the server was new, or that the kitchen was short staffed etc. I don't really care about that as a consumer, just want to know how I am going to be helped at the moment.  It was an extremely lovely and sunny day outside and we planned to enjoy our lunch on your patio but instead had to eat it inside of the office while working.

We take a pager and go into the bar for a 5 min wait.  We both ordered beer and in 5 min the buzzer goes off. I take it back to the host section.  2 girls and a guy there.  I try to give the buzzer to the guy who's not doing squat and he points at the girl in front of him ""She'll help you"".  After the girl takes my buzzer this same guy grabs two menus and leads me to the booth.  Job specialization?  He's not trained in buzzer handling only menu handling?  Ok minor nit. We were both 1/4 of the say through our beers.  We scanned the menu, made our choices.  They wouldn't come by.  Beer 1/2 way done.  We closed our menus and put it the edge of the table.  No one comes, not even to bring water.  Beers 3/4 done - my gf stops someone and says ""We haven't been helped yet"".  Staff person looks confused, says ""OK"" and goes away and doesn't come back. Beers now finished.  I make the call to walk out.  On our way out I told the girl at the hostess station (the non buzzer handler wasn't there) that we finished our drinks and no one came by to take our order and we were leaving. Now at this point, a manager should have been called, an offer could have been made  - dessert on the house, drink on the house, 10% off coupon, SOMETHING to let me know you want my business back.  She just looked bewildered and said ""Oh, I'm so sorry"".  I even said ""I'm not chewing you out, just giving you feedback"". She nodded. I will say the BJ's in Dublin is better - not great, but better.   As JJ said below, I blame management.  Customer service is largely determined by culture and if your manager doesn't care (he probably doesn't even read these - my single star is not an isolated case) then your employees won't care.

Our server was actually really responsive and our food came out quickly but the food was an issue. First our calamari appetizer was overcooked to the point it was beyond chewy and the breading was bitter. Our server was great and offered to replace it but we had entrees coming so I passed on more/fresh batch. I ordered a burger and had to send back because it still had lettuce on it (ok so I admit I could have pulled it off myself but I told the server about it when he brought it to the table and he immediately took it back) my husbands scallops were another story. The asparagus that came with the scallops was inedible. Whoever cooked them had loped off the tender tips and cooked the woody ends. My hubs is a good sport and tried to eat them but couldn't. So I will give my waiter Tony and the mgr Chris props. Tony was very attentive and wanted to make it right. So did his mgr Chris who seemed happy to get the feedback.

We get a vacuous stare from the employee at the podium and NO ONE of the other three employees buzzing around will look at us. Finally someone does and she goes off to set up a table and it takes her over ten minutes to put two tables together and find the place settings.  We were seated at 11:29. It turns out that we were in her section. She disappears for ten minutes but comes back very bubbly. She wants to take our food order at the same time as the drink order as obviously we have had enough time while she was gone to make a decision of what to eat for lunch.  They have a very extensive selection of food. I got a lunch special. I liked mine. It came with half a flatbread pizza and a green salad with all veggies. The other five peoples reaction to the food ranged from a shrugged shoulder to ""meh"" to "" it was ok/good"" to ""I liked it!""  I guess if you have what you want to eat instead of picking something in a hurry then it tastes better.  We had a birthday and got a freshly made cookie with ice cream. It was devoured quickly.   The service after we sat down was very good. The dishes were brought out timely and quickly cleared. We finished about 12:25 and there was quite a wait to be seated when we left. The Vacuous One was still there looking as though nothing was ""her job"".  I saw no host/ess leading patrons to any tables and we had quite a walk from our table to the front and saw many empty tables. It was crowded and disorganized in the front and again, no one looked like they knew what was going on.  I would suggest Management train staff that most clients want to be seated quickly. A good start to the dining experience encourages a larger tip. Secondly, look and act competent. This means knowing how much time it will take to seat guests, where the other staff is in relation to getting a table set up and being able to communicate with the guests, AND being able to process seating requests quickly. Then, training on not having the guests wait for the server to acknowledge them and NOT expecting that leaving them alone guarantees they will make a decision as to their meal.  It makes them cranky and makes them think of walking out.

We always felt like we could walk in and know what we're getting with this chain- but apparently NOT THIS ONE!!! They must be hurting for money because our pizza (BJ's favorite) had VERY little toppings and honestly, we'd asked for extra sauce and got light sauce. When we told the waitress, she offered to bring us sauce, ensuring it'd be heated- I know how they do things- she was going to microwave it and  serve it up COLD! You should make me the next Long Island medium... This is exactly what happened. Next she offered to run it through the pizza oven as if that would heat it up. We said never mind because not only was the pizza lacking on so many levels... The carnitas fries were DISGUSTING! Cold uncooked verde sauce atop soggy shoe-string fries and carnitas that resembled tree bark, both in appearance and taste. Such a let down! Not going to give BJ's franchise any more of my money for sure! It's only good 1 out of every 3 times. This one was particularly horrible, so I wanted to warn people. This is to let the public know it's a place you should run away from because they are cutting corners BIG TIME! When the manager came over I explained all that I just explained above and he offered his apology and agreed you can't expect pizza sauce to be cooked in a microwave. So he only offered to take off the pizza which we adamantly refused to eat or take with us anyway- but no apology for our tree bark fries. Then as they both stood at the register and removed the pizza from the ticket he was saying something about us and laughing with her- After bringing us the bill for the fries and wings they offered a pizookie, if you can't make your other food right why would I trust you to make anything else?

325,Vivian L.,"San Jose, CA",18,17,11.0,1.0,2014-09-12,"Food was fine, but don't even get me started about the service. It was self seating so we found a table and sat. A man comes over and tells us that our server was a female, but a male show up as our server without explaining why it was not the female instead. Most of the time if the original server the table assign was going to be change the new server who comes will say something like oh ""so and so is going on a lunch break and I'll be taking his or her place"" but apparently that did not happen. So fine no big deal.  Our male server name was FRANK. He swing by took our order and some other guy came to deliver the food. We ate our food and was pretty much done. Frank comes back to the table and ask if we wanted dessert and we asked to give us a sec because we wanted to get a quick general consensus on whether we wanted to order or not. Well apparently Frank did not hear and said ""I'll come back"" because it was too much to ask to wait for 30 seconds. So there Frank goes off and the general consensus of our table was no dessert. We wanted to get the check instead and call it a night since it was getting pretty late.  We sat there for five minutes and see Frank no where in sight. Then after a few more minutes we still don't see Frank coming back to our table, so we ask another female server who walk pass by for the check. So apparently she tries to go around looking for Frank to tell him our table wants the check. Cuz apparently she can't go to the computer and punch in our table number to print the check since the computer was like right next to her. Fine..at this point we are already fed up with the speed of the service.  Frank then finally comes back with the check and goes missing again. We waited another five minute or so for him to swing back around, but yet still not sign of Frank. So one of use walk up to the front to ring up the check, but apparently they don't ring up the check. The people up at the front desk handled the check to another server who apparently also can't ring up the check goes on a major exploration to find Frank. Well of course by now reading this long we review you can all conclude that our server Frank goes ""missing"" a lot. So it took about another good five minutes for that server to find Frank. Our table at this point is very very upset at the speed of service. Come on how long does it take to ring up a check. It took almost as long for our food to come out from the kitchen. YES it was that ridiculous.  After at least a good 10 minute wait FRANK finally shows up with the check already ring up. AND GUESS WHAT??!! Frank with a very nasty attitude and voice told us ""Don't hand the other server the check cuz they have to go around to find me"" WELL Excuse me sir you were no where to be seen and we been waiting quite some time already. So friendly I reply back saying ""You were not around and we waited a long time"" Typically at this point you would expect the server to say ""Oh Im sorry to have kept you waiting."" But no FRANK here decided to back talk his customer saying ""Um NO I was right there at the table next to you"". Let me make it straight by the time Frank claiming himself to be at the table next to us we had already pass the check to the front desk long ago already. Last time I check server should be respectful to their customer. I am paying money for the food and service and this is how you treat your customer are you for real. Common courtesy that customer is to be respected and value when they enter your restaurant because they are the guest at your place. We will not be returning to this BJ location for its service is beyond disappointing and I hope future customer who goes does not have to experience a server like FRANK.  One more thing I still don't understand is why does every table need to only be designated one server. Yes I get that a server is in charge of certain tables, but why does it have to be split so clearly. This table is my customer and if they have some small problem like need plate or ring up check its none of my business since Im not the assign server for that table. Don't server works as a team yes you are assign a certain area table whatever, but why can't you help each other out since you are on the ""same team"" (same restaurant). Anyway this point is more a personal opinion I guess. I seen far more similar restaurant like BJ and their servers really know how to work as a team even if they were assign to tables meaning ring up check for their customer.  If you like to have good service I say save yourself the trouble and go to another BJ location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=360,2.92,2.73,2.73,1.7320000000000002,2.806
476,Lillian T.,"San Jose, CA",186,86,14.0,2.0,2014-09-12,"I really want to give them more stars, but every time I come here, I get pretty disappointed, even if I keep giving them chances. I came here twice recently and on both occasions, I was a bit disappointed. This review will be based on my recent experience, though I have had previous experience here also. The first time, I came here with some friends for dinner. For those of you that may not know, BJ's has a pretty extensive menu, much like Cheesecake Factory, so.. don't exactly expect the best food for that reason. I believe we came on a Saturday night, and there wasn't much of a wait. It's a pretty big location, so even though they were pretty busy, there were still open tables. I ordered their shrimp tacos (new) with a side salad. My friends ordered some other things that I did not try. Time passes, and they bring out all our entrees, but where is my side salad that was supposed to come before the meal? :( The server came by and I inquired about it. Turns out, she had forgot to put the order in, but said she would take care of it (comp). I thought that was nice of her, but when the salad came out, it was just this dinky place of lettuce! What kind of side salad is that? It literally looks like someone took some lettuce out of a bag and threw it out on the plate and added some dressing. Needless to say, I was actually pretty disappointed with that salad. I ate the salad and my tacos around the same time because my tacos had already come out. The tacos were around $10 and were okay. They use baby shrimp and there's about 3 or 4 pieces in each (2) taco. I have to say, it was hardly worth my $10.  My second most recent encounter, was for a weekday happy hour. Their happy hour has changed since I've known it. It used to have a bigger variety of appetizers and I believe it used to also be a better deal in terms of price. My friend and I ended up order two mini $6 deep dish pizza's, a $5 appetizer of wings and sauces, and a $5 with $1 supplement of sliders with bacon and cheese. These were all items on the HH menu. I'm not entirely sure how they make their deep dish pizza's, but all the toppings essentially sink in the middle so the pizza's come out looking a bit of a funnel going downwards. The pizzas were actually pretty good but a bit salty, considering we got the ones with so much meat. The meat was not slathered on, but sufficed. The sliders that came out were typically slider size, and comes with a side of fries. I don't really have much to complain about that order, and would probably order the sliders again, but man, little burgers are pricey. Next, our review of the wings. They allow you to choose 3 dipping sauces because the wings are not tossed already, but rather, you dip them yourself. The plate comes with 5 wings, and some celery. I mean come on.. for $5, you're giving me pinky sized wings that do not taste nearly as good as Wingstops pinky sized wings? I definitely regret that order the most. The wings were not the only downside to this story- but I don't know if they were short staffed or what, but service was extremely slow. My water never got refilled, I waited forever for the check and for my receipt. Our server was friendly though so that's a plus. Overall, I actually don't like coming to BJ's very much because they have always been pretty pricey for bar type food. I have had a few good experiences where I would vouch for them, but those experiences were quite a while ago, and I'm pretty sure the company culture isn't the same now. I always tell myself to not go, but I always end up back there for whatever stupid reason to give them another chance. It'll probably happen again, but I hope my review helped some people decide on if they want to dine here or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=580,2.84,2.74,2.74,1.8,2.7800000000000002

BJ's is one of those iconic places you drive by and remember having a pazookie or a small dinner and some beer. I don't typically think poorly about BJ's but the other night's experience was just a tad lack-luster. Parking around here  is really what you'd expect from a busy plaza next to a busy Target and other restaurants. You might get lucky and grab a spot up front or you might find a place a bit further back, but it's still nothing to REALLY complain about. I will give them props for a good busy location however.  Workers here are pretty hit or miss in terms of quality. The front desk/hostesses were extremely nice and friendly. We were expecting 8 but had 7 and then there was some weird misunderstanding about if we actually had 9 (most of which was our group's fault so I can't blame them). The hostesses worked it out quickly and put us in a great spot near the window. Our waiter however was a bit awkward. I asked him if they had any seasonal beers which he explained and  when I told him ""Oh, no thanks, they don't sound that appealing,"" he waited for me to order a different beer. I guess he really wanted me to buy some beer. Anyway he was awkward in the sense that it seemed like he expected us to order more but we couldn't be bothered if there wasn't anything there we wanted. The same thing happened when we ordered our food. He sort of just waited there even after we said, ""I think that's it for now. Thanks."" The weird thing was even though he seemed so ""helpful"" it was like a 20 minute gap between my empty waters till he noticed that I was waving at him. Definitely a lack-luster experience. The food at this BJ's is just like the other ones, and for the most part I probably could have made the same thing at home. The pazookies were pretty normal but by the time we finished them people were dying of sugar overloads.  Overall, this BJ's is just... well, another BJ's and isn't anything particularly special.

When we walked in, the host did not acknowledge us even though it didn't look too busy on Monday night, and we were surprised because of the grand entrance through the revolving door. No smile, takes us to our seat, a lone table in the center of an aisle of booths, most if which were filled. We felt a lil awkward, like being on stage, so we ask our server to move to a booth right next to the table, still in her section. No prob.  Our server took our order, and that's the last time she talked to us the rest of the night. By the end, I forgot her name and what her voice sounded like. We tried flagging her down for water, small plates, questions on the menu, and it was so bizarre... She made eye contact, went to another table, and didn't revisit us or check up on us, ask us how our food was. After we lost faith in her, we tried flagging down other servers who walked by, but we might as well tried flagging down a train with no brakes. It was like... ""Zooommmm, not my problem.""  It felt bad being ignored and generally not acknowledged as guests and paying customers.  Foodwise, we got the great white pizza, cobb salad, avocado eggrolls, poke appetizer, fried artichoke small plate. The pizza was soggy, salad was mostly overdressed lettuce and no toppings, artichoke was mostly dense fried bread, and in the poke salad there was very little fish.  When we were almost done, our server went on lunch. We hoped that the new server would be more attentive, but NOPE. By the time we tried flagging someone down for the check, looking for our server, we felt like brats, saying ""pay attention to us!"" We definitely expect better service at BJs. After a while, we found our server flirting with the guy helping her run food... Very unprofessional.

326,Mike M.,"Santa Clara, CA",20,41,10.0,1.0,2014-10-31,"Let's start at the beginning... Appetizer: half and half boneless wings. Took a while for appetizers to show. When they showed up, only 5 pieces were on the plate--the other half of the plate was empty, but had remnants of sauce of pieces that WERE there. Not sure what that was about. Wife's entree: she ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad with salmon. It came with no brussels sprouts whatsoever, and what looked like arugula instead of kale. It also had blueberries, which was not specified in the menu description. My entree: I ordered the salmon dinner. It was fine, until I discovered that one of the lemon wedges looked like it had been chewed upon already--very unappetizing. Also, it was hidden under the salmon, as if they were trying to hide it. I asked for the manager at that point. The server walked away to get the manager. We waited quite a while, and the kitchen manager came out to talk to us. Instead of apologies, he tried to explain that they use baby kale. It did not look like baby kale. Moreover, the salad was completely devoid of brussels sprouts. He went away to get my wife a bowl of Brussels sprouts and some lemon wedges for me. Instead of making us feel good about the outcome, he came across as arrogant and condescending, and we almost felt ashamed--but we were too upset to feel ashamed.  The server came back out, and noticed our dissatisfaction. She went back to look for the manager. After a long while (again), the manager came out to talk to us. I showed her the lemon wedge -instead of apologies, she started with ""let me teach you something about how lemons are cut in our kitchen..."" She went on about some mechanical cutter that automatically cuts lemons. My wife was displeased, but did not say anything at that point. I didn't buy the manager's story either. Most lemons I know are cut by hand with a knife. There's no process that I know of where lemons would be cut to look like they had small bites taken out of them. Again, no apologies. She was just as arrogant and condescending as the kitchen manager. We were done with the bullshitting experience. They took the boneless wings off of the bill, but we still ended up paying roughly $50 for a dinner experience that was subpar and disappointing. I was expecting a further discount for the unappetizingly lousy presentation, the extraordinarily long wait for our meals, the wrong dish being served to my wife, and for the overall treatment from both managers--the bullshitting and the arrogance.  I will never eat at a BJ's ever again. You see this kind of nightmare on Gordon Ramsey's show--I never thought restaurants could truly be this bad.

So I KNOW the struggle. Because of that I am a lot more empathetic to my fellow server brothers and sisters. But honestly, not everyone is cut out for this type of job.  When someone doesn't greet me, check in with me, or even bring me water after they finally came around to ""check in,"" there is something wrong there. Another waiter brought out our drinks, the bus boy brought out our food, and the young woman who was supposed to be ""serving"" us was talking to the same person 5 booths away for us for about 20-30 minutes.

We understood it would be busy. I called ahead and told them we had a party of 12 coming. The girl on the phone was nice. We got there and she said it would be about an hour before we were seated. Understandable. So we were waiting... And waiting..... And waiting... An hour passes and we're patient cus they're busy. We get that. But then we've waited for about 2 hours till we got seated.  When we got seated they were missing two chairs..... Really? You had it written down for 12 people. Anyways we just grabbed our own chair and got everyone seated OURSELVES. Sat for about 10 mins before any servers came to our table to introduce themselves... Cool. We had two waiters Carlo and another fellow. Forgot his name. Worst service ever. We ordered right when we sat down cus we were starving and had been looking at the menu for almost 2 hours outside waiting to be seated. It took another hour for our food to come out. But 4 of our burger orders were cold and my plate didn't come out. I waited and waited and 10 mins later they said they have to make it again because anther waiter grabbed it..... By then the whole table had finished eating and my food hasn't even gotten out yet. I understand you can't blame our waiter completely but there were TWO waiters for our party and they couldn't even handle it? Seriously?  What made it worse was that they laughed when I was angry my food wasn't out. Then left our table and gave us another waiter. I believe his name was David. He was probably the best.

Not good restaurant or brew house food. The buzz doesn't make it any better.. Some people love it, to each his own.. The Pizzookie used to be fantastic, but its been at least 3 years since i've had a good one. Good indicator that they have gone bad and may stay that way.

I'm not sure if they still brew o site anymore, I mean they used to sell growlers and don't know, wonder what that's all about, right? But the beer just doesn't taste fresh like it should. I mean, I love breweries because the beer is fresh. I even brew my own for the fresh taste. But the beer here is just overpowering, oddly flavored, and they make sooo many different ones.

Parking was decently easy as this BJs is on the outskirts of the plaza and the businesses nearby it was already closed around 7:40pm when I was looking for a spot.  The wait for 2 people was 20-25minutes pretty similar to the other BJ locations. Other reviews made me wary of the food and either my taste buds have changed or my standards have or this location isn't as great as the others.  I had the enlightened chicken pesto sandwich which was a new item.  I have to say it was just ok.  The salad part tasted like it wasn't cleaned all the way and there was absolutely no dressing for it,  I had to use the sauce from the mini bruschetta to have some sort of flavor to make the dirt like greens go down easier.  The sandwich itself I would say is good IF they had put more cheese or sauce.  The chicken portion I wish was a little more to cover the whole slice of bread but I can understand for cost reasons why it might not be an option.   But why not add more sauce or even greens the amount on the sandwich was sad.  The menu says there is basil pesto and garlic aioli and I just saw a smear of pesto and another yellow color on the sourdough which I presume was aioli.  The sandwich needed a kick of more sauce for flavor as it was bland.  I ended up taking half the sandwich home and asked for some garlic aioli to go home but sadly when I got home I realized the waitress gave me Ranch.  How can ranch be the same as garlic aioli?? Disappointment  My friend had ordered the mini bruschetta to share and the honey lime scallops I was happy to see that the scallop dish looked like they offered a good portion of scallops and I believe she was ok with it she ate half.  As far as the bruschetta goes it was very hard small chunks of focaccia bread with a mild sprinkle of cheese and tomatoes, it definitely could've had more to it, especially when the bread was pretty hard and a thick thick slice.  Usually if the bruschetta is hard the slice is thinner. Funny thing is some waiter came by gave us 2 plates and said our appetizer was on its way.  A minute later our entrees came and no appetizer to be found halfway into our entrees the appetizer arrived.   Though I did find it odd to be told one thing is coming, but something else comes instead,  I think they need to perfect the timing.  If no one said anything about appetizers coming we wouldn't be concerned or care about the timing and would've carried on our conversation. The pizookie we ordered came out yummy, but I did question one thing I felt the inside of the cookie tasted more doughy and less cooked than I remember.  I wish I got the ice cream on the side since it helped mask the undercookness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=240,1.92,2.38,2.376,2.38,2.1959999999999997

One of them was mingling with her friend/guests and the others ignored me. I stood there for a few minutes pretty conscious of the poor customer service already. A few more minutes later a hostess looked right at me and the phone rang. She picked it up instead of acknowledging me.

At the end of the meal, she kept forgetting to give us a box, even though we asked like 3 times. I always have a good experience at BJs, so there isn't much to complain about.

We wait near the front, and about 20 min go by so we decided to check with the receptionist. turns out they never put my name in. So they said we would be the next party to be seated. I see about 3 groups go, (granted they had 3+ people), but we still waited another 15 min before we were seated. Unacceptable. We should have just sat in the bar area. When we sat down, it took awhile for the waiter to greet us. Then, she didnt even ask us what we wanted to drink. Instead, she was ready to take our order. Also, we had to ask another waiter for utensils. :/ I ordered the fish and chips, which i felt the batter could have been less heavy.

Pretty crowded but like I said we expected that due to the popularity and just because it was a Friday. The bathrooms are nice haha. It was both of our first times here, we heard good things but honestly the food was just okay. Don't get me wrong it wasn't extremely bad! It just wasn't as great as people put it out to be. We ordered some carne asada fries as an appetizer, which we asked to have first since our server offered, but we had to ask where they were AFTER all the rest of our food came. They were okay, the chile verde slightly over powered everything and there was just a large chunk or two of meat put on the side. I guess that's just how they make it? Eh, it wasn't so appealing. The ahi poke was alright. The corn fritters were really good at first but the last one I had wasn't cooked through all the way so the middle was a ball of batter and I just couldn't finish the rest of it after discovering that.  Also, when I tried to ask our server what corn fritters were since I've never tried them, she said ""Well, if you just read the description it says it right there."" Yes... I read it...

However my experience at this one location certainly did put a sour taste in my mouth. I placed an order to go and arrived to the restaurant at closing to pick it up but they had already locked their doors. I signaled one of the waiters and even mouthed and said it out loud "" I placed an order to go and I'm here to pick it up"". The waiter continued to say sorry we're closed and pretended to ignore me and walked away. Mind you he was pretty far from the door and did not make the effort to get closer to the door to give me an explanation or anything. I continued to wait and saw him walk by again and I repeated the process of letting him know I was there to pick up the order but he did not make an effort to get close to the door and had an attitude throughout this entire time. Finally a waitress went by and let me in and I told her I'd like to speak to the manager about the situation. The manager was completely incompetent at her job when I told her what happened. She just gave me a lame apology and said that it was a matter of safety that waiters can't come close to the door. The waiter then showed up didn't really apologize when I told him how I felt he was rude and he still gave no apology. The manager didn't do anything else to reprimand him when I told her he could've explained the safety issue and that he did not show any willingness to notify me or help me while I was freezing outside being locked out. I too have worked in customer service and both these two individuals did not do anything to rectify the situation,  even the apology was half assed.

We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to share, and it also could have been better. There was little to no sauce on it at all, and the large chucks of tomato was odd with the little bbq sauce that there was on it. We asked for onions on only half, and when it was served, we couldn't even tell which half had the onions (so either there were none on either half, or they were hidden under the cheese). When the pizza was served, my friend asked for a side of ranch. It never came. Our server also never stopped back at our table until we were done eating the pizza (or we would have asked him again for the ranch). For a $40 meal for two, it just fell short.

I came to this location because I think it's not as busy as the Oakridge Mall or Cupertino location.

I'm already annoyed cause now it's gonna be hard to finish all the mozzarella sticks cause we have this pizza in front of us too. I was even more annoyed because the mozzarella sticks were not warm nor crispy as I remember them to be. I always get the mozzarella sticks at BJ's cause they're that good to me and I was a bit disappointed that they did not taste the same. It seemed like the appetizer was probably sitting under the food lamp/light/heater thingy while the pizza was cooking so they could bring out the food at the same time, which is something I clearly did not want.  On top of this, our server was rushing us to leave. He refilled our water only because I asked if I could get more water. Then he asked if we wanted dessert when we weren't even done with our pizza! Dropped off the check when we just started eating our Pizookie. He came by a few minutes later and asked if the bill was ready and it was not.

Our group of 50 people had already pre-ordered our selections about 1-1/2 months ago. Selections were roast beef sandwich with French fries, grilled chicken sandwich with French fries, or a cobb salad. A dessert of pizookie (warm chocolate chip cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream) was included with our meal. My husband and I opted for the cobb salad. Neither he nor I were totally impressed with the salad. It was a huge salad tossed with a creamy garlic dressing; however, more than 2/3 of the salad was loaded with chopped lettuce and romaine. There were a few pieces of chopped applewood bacon and a measley amount of cubed turkey. There was a fair amount of chopped tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese and 1/2 of an avocado. Cost of the salad: $12.95 - definitely not worth the price. (My spring mix garden salad with house dressing at Bubbaloo Cafe in Richmond was much better. It was served with two grilled pork chops and special onion gravy over rice. Cost: $8.95; a much better value.) Cobb salad: 2 stars. My husband bought me an Arnie Palmer. It was okay, but too much ice in the beverage resulted in a diluted, flavorless one after about 5 sips.

I had no idea this place had reservations otherwise I would've called in advance (no, they don't take reservations on the day of). I thought the wait time for a group that big was going to be at least 1.5+ wait but it was only an hour, which in my opinion wasn't that bad. Our server was extremely helpful and very patient in waiting for everyone to place their order. I was getting tired of eating pasta so I decided to order the California Club Sandwich?.. anyways, I wasn't all that great. The chicken was really dry and I felt like the bread had a lot of grease on it. Of course for dessert I had to order the pizookie, I got the chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla ice cream and oh man!

442,Taylor R.,"San Jose, CA",61,57,17.0,1.0,2015-03-09,"Okay, so I have been putting this review off for a couple MONTHS in hopes that this location would give me something other than negative points to write in this review, but unfortunately that is not the case. Every time. And I mean EVERY time I come here there is something wrong. So I will start with the first experience: I came in with a group of friends and say on the patio, out server couldn't handle a large group. We ended up staying give or take THREE hours. (This was meant to be a nice quick dinner to catch up with each other) One of the biggest things I was concerned about was when our server brought me an alcoholic beverage. I am 20. I did. Not ask for the drink and let him know. He apologized and took it back. Really? Do you want to loose your alcohol license? I think not.  Frustrated and annoyed with the lack of service we tracked down our server after not seeing him for close to an hour to get our check. Long story short, I did not want to come back. Second visit: I was a little hesitant to come back, but decided to give this location another shot since this time we were a party of three I thought or server could handle it. Well, I was wrong. My friends ordered a pizza and I got the chicken tortilla soup and a salad. The pizza took 30 minutes to come out(fine) But what was not fine was it was the wrong pizza. Our server took it back and placed the order or the correct pizza. 30 minutes later, the right pizza! Yay! So waited an hour for pizza. Thumbs down. And also got the chicken tortilla soup. We finished the pizza and soup and surprise! Still no salad. I asked our server to take it off since it never came out. Our total stay was 2 hours. 2 hours for a pizza and soup. I had to get up twice to ask for water, because our services did not once come by to refill our glasses. After this time I swore never to come back. Third visit: Yesterday. Why did in come back here? I know I'm just setting myself up for a terrible experience. But, a friend was in town and wanted to come here. Noooo :c  Anyways I got a table and waited for my friend and ordered potstickers. They were good and came out in a timely matter. My friend showed up and we ordered the carnitas fries, sliders and guess what? Chicken tortilla soup!. And I made it very clear I just wanted a cup. Of. Chicken. Tortilla. Soup. That's it.  Our server dropped off the fries and walked away before I could ask for small plates. Another server brought out  the rest of our food, sliders came out fine. But she set down a bread bowl of the chicken tortilla soup.... How do you mess that up? I just want a cup of soup :( I asked her just for soup. She didn't say anything and walked away with the bread bowl. Time passed No refill on water, so I went to go find our server. Yay water! And yay for finally getting chicken tortilla soup!! We didn't see our sever after that. Someone else took over. She didn't even tell us someone else was going to take over. She was rude. And clearly ""over it""  word of advise for being in the service industry: don't get complacent. Be humble. Else your tips will reflect on your customer service. I am going to be writing a follow up review for the server who took over, who is the ONLY reason I will ever be dining in on this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=460,2.76,2.37,2.424,2.116,2.5260000000000002

Low and Behold- They're terrible.   The first few times I went the food was eh but I didn't really mind because I went right when the location opened so I figured they were still working the kinks out, no big deal. I hadn't gone for a while and I moved really close by so I've gone a lot more lately.  The last 3 or 4 times I had always sat in the cocktail area.  Mostly figured for the happy hour and never really thought twice about it because I had a good experience.  This last time I went I sat in the dining room because it was Saturday and there was no happy hour. Huge mistake. I got there around 11:15 so still about 45 minutes until they close. Our server, Michael Y, didn't greet us for about 10 minutes. And when he finally came we ordered drinks and the three of us also asked for waters. He came back and only brought two waters.. okay thanks? Whatever. Then he came another 10 minutes later and took our order.  I asked him to take off the mayonnaise on my order and change the side from salad to french fries. Not that hard right? My boyfriends entree has a choice of rice and he chose brown rice with his chicken.  When he brought our food my boyfriends chicken has the rice pilaf, my turkey burger had nothing but lettuce (when its supposed to have other toppings) the burger bun was black from being burnt and he brought me the salad instead of fries.  He completely ignored everything we had asked. He didn't want anything to do with us. He would walk away when I would ask him for something and he just didn't do any of the modifications we asked. When he could tell I was dissatisfied with my entree he asked if I still wanted it, at this point I was over it so I just gave it back to him.  And the manger did come by and talk to me so I can appreciate that.  And he said he was going to take my entree off the bill, but he said it like he was doing me a favor... I didn't even eat it. I'm not going to pay for it. Either way, the whole thing was a waste of my time and super disappointing. Terrible service and my entree looked disgusting.  I hesitated giving one star because in the cocktail area I've had two servers specifically that I really like. But this experience was terrible and makes me not want to support this location.

I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was on the lighter side menu. The fish was cooked well and the veggies were great. However i felt as if they used too much ginger. I felt like the dish was over powered by it. I also ordered cheddar broccoli soup which was okay. I have actually had better cheddar broccoli soup from togos.

360,Jesse W.,"Santa Clara, CA",39,68,60.0,2.0,2015-03-23,"I often recommend BJ's for social gatherings because the menu offerings are generally crowd pleasing. The beer selection is good. Their signature deep dish pizzas are tasty. The pizookies are awesome. Unfortunately, I have to say this Coleman Ave location falls very short of the standards other BJ's restaurants have set. I first visited within a couple weeks after their grand opening. The service was terrible. I understand that many of them were probably new employees, and likely students from the nearby universities, but even their managers seemed inexperienced. The waitress who took our orders seemed very confused. When things were brought out they were incorrect. Some drinks we ordered never came, and after multiple reminders, we were finally told they were 'out of stock' of one of the ingredients. This was about a year and a half ago. I hesitated to write a review then, because I wanted to give them another chance after some time.  I came back a month or two later, and it was the same story. It was even worse to me, because I had brought back a bigger group for lunch time, with reservations. I expected with reservations being an advance notice, they would be sure to have adequate staff and service. This was not the case. Again orders were goofed. Service seemed confused. Managers seemed unable to help. But I still didn't give up. In the past year, most recently two weeks ago, I have returned 3 more times for various occasions. The story has not changed. I'm pretty disappointed to have to say I don't recommend this location until they get their act together.

We asked if they can switch the channel for one of them to show the NBA game and both times we were told ""Ok, I'll check with the manager"". Mind you we asked two different waiters. 1hr there and they never changed it. What made it even worse was the fact that they were showing the game in the other side of the restaurant but because of the layout of the room, we couldn't see anything.

The reception at the front desk was pretty decent. We were a 4 member group and given a booth which we pretty much liked. We had specifications of no beef, bacon or mushrooms in our dishes which was catered to very well. However, while taking our orders, we felt, we were being rushed into. The lady tending to us would end up completing our sentences. ""It's a good thing to know what your customer wants but it's better if you listen to them first."" Generally our ordering food was vocalized by her throughout which we didn't appreciate. This mode was going this until we finished ordering the main course. It had been just a few minutes since we began and the lady popped in to check if wanted any dessert. We didn't want any, and lo behold, just a minute later, the cheque lands on our table and she walked off saying we could pay up whenever we were ready! This high speed of having to finish and wrap away got on to our nerves.  Pointers to the management at BJ's Coleman avenue: -Train your staff members, especially the ones who are serving, to be patient and LISTEN!! Though they may know what we are trying to get at, it's nicer if we were allowed to express it first. - Do not rush us out, after all we did come there to spend time and make merry. May be we would end up ordering a couple of more drinks if you hadn't landed the cheque on us before we even hinted that we were ready. - Having verbal courtesies but your actions not speaking for it doesn't really do any good.

There's tons of empty tables all around. Such a disappointment!  I will only come back for the pizookies! Their food here tastes like gourmet microwaveable dinner. Not worth it. Pizza is hard, stale and flavorless. Baked potato was microwaved and undercooked. Steak was tough, dry and sucks for whoever has to clean the wad of steak gum my son had to spit out. Thin cut fries were mediocre. Cajun pasta tasted like cafeteria food. If anything, El Camino hospital smacks on their food here. We tried a few other dishes here but it's nothing special because I can't remember anything good about it.  Anyway, spend your money elsewhere.

It wasn't crowded bc it was only 430. We got seated right away but it degraded from there. We immediately saw four servers hanging around the exit door which is where we sat in our booth, and not one person came to our table in 20 min of waiting. I had to get the attention of the male server who of course said he thought someone else had our table. Before I got his attention we asked the useless hostess to get us a server and her response was, OK, if I see one I'll tell them. IF YOU SEE ONE? Really? This is the no talent that they hired? We were incredulous by her response. It then took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. Again, the place was near empty. I brought this issue to the manager's attention, who I watched during our visit and he looked like a goober, and of course, he did absolutely nothing about the situation. The least he should have done to recoup the situation was to comp out a drink or an appetizer. It seemed like the servers and manager had something better to do like talk and giggle, rather than serve customers.

There were only 3 parties sitting in the patio. 3)Not fully cooked Pizookie. We get our pizookie and the cookie dough is like half cooked- super mushy. We basically had Pizookie soup.

Our waitress promptly took our order - got our drinks, filled them, filled them again and before we knew it 40 minutes had passed by with no food. Our waitress said ""the kitchen was backed up"" - um, when we sat down the restaurant was fairly empty. Granted 40 minutes later it was getting fuller (still not an entirely packed house as I have seen it). One manager came over and wanted to argue with me that we ordered at the busiest time - um, no we did not. Our waitress was very kind the whole time and you could tell this was not a good day for the kitchen. So our food finally arrived, about 50 minutes in at this point. My brussel-sprout kale salad arrived with no brussel sprouts :(. We were already so late at this point, I told the waitress I would eat as is (I hate wasting food) and it was quite tasty although those brussel sprouts would have been delicious I am sure. Now, the reason for the 3 stars - while still eating, I am assuming it was the supervisor who came out and informed us due to the issues we had to deal with, our meal was covered and she apologized profusely, no excuses, just covered our meals and provided me with a gift card and asked us to come back again. That was so sweet and unnecessary to comp our entire meal. And I am sure there was some crazy issue going on today that they did not fully explain - I understand issues do happen.

Here's what I had: The mac and cheese appetizer: 1 star The menu makes it sound super fancy, but it's not. It didn't taste like there was even cheese on it. It was very dry and not flavorful. Super bland. I'm not one to waste food, but they wasted their time making something like that for the menu. The noodles weren't even done right-- dry and chewy. Like, come on. How do you get mac and cheese noodles wrong?  The Best Beginnings appetizer platter: 3 stars This wasn't bad. The artichoke dip was good and I really like the Santa Fe spring rolls, as well. Good flavors in the spring rolls.  Mahi Mahi Tacos: 1 star Egh... Just no. I shouldn't have ordered it. I always take my food home, but it was't worth it here because I knew I wouldn't have eaten it. Guacamole was too watery, like, how do you water down guac? Fish was definitely not even close to fresh and the chipotle mayo was drenched with a too big soft taco wrap. Salsa didn't taste fresh either. They got this taco all wrong. Tacos are about fresh ingredients. Even if you don't have many ingredients, or it's not super fancy or complicated... have fresh ingredients for a taco. Definitely wouldn't ever order that or eat here again.  Service: 3 stars.  Okay enough. We had to wait mad long, even though there was plenty of seats available, but maybe that's a part of how they manage serving so many people. I don't know. The food was brought out at a decent time for a big group, and everyone we had was friendly enough. Nothing to rave about or complain about. Super average.

Service was slow, and heaven forbid you want to see a manger because I swear they hide in their office to avoid customers! We placed our order and our waiter forgot the kids pizza. He looked surprised when I asked where it was, although he only gave us 4 plates for pizza for our party of 5! He placed the order, then came back and said he had written it on the back. Ok, at least he acknowledged, but when a server messes up, my experience has been they offer a free dessert or even give you the kids meal for free. I mean, how do you forget the kids meal? Because my son had to wait 15 minutes for his meal, he ended up eating some of ours and no longer hungry when his meal finally came out. Service, in general, was below par. Had to continually ask for refills, and even though it was graduation day, there were only a handful of graduates and families there; it definitely was no packed for lunch! After we paid, I thought I would see the manager. Nope, the manager took over 10 minutes to come out, at which point we left. We had enough of poor service. If a manager makes guests wait that long to talk to, it's no wonder why the servers care less about providing excellent service. Too bad. Good food, horrible service, and his tip reflected it!

I appreciate seeing this. It means they care enough to clean the booths in great detail and customers like me will enjoy a meal in a clean and sanitized environment. I've worked at a restaurant before and providing the best experience to patrons is key. Big kudos!  The food can be hit or miss at different locations, but it was great this time. Our order consisted of nicely battered calamari and pepperoni explosion flatbread. This was so tasty! The mains were ahi tuna salad (big, delicious salad indeed) and deep dish pizza (what they are known for). The sparkling rasberry lemonade was refreshing.

My partner asked to see the manager on our way out.  A woman appeared named Joanne, after about 5-7 minutes waiting for her, she was the manager.  Myself nor my partner have ever seen her here, as she is not walking around the floor, though she claimed she had seen us.  When my partner let her know he was unhappy with the service as I mentioned above including the last straw when the server had his thumb in his salad due to carrying it wrong, she responded, ""well I've seen you here for the last hour and your cup has been full the whole time,"" among other statements, none of which were ""I am sorry.""  She not only implied that he was likely drunk she also implied that his account of how service was being delivered was false.  This manager needs to be better at customer service, actually manage and train her staff better, and listen to feedback.  Rather than acknowledge my partners feedback she defensively tried to turn the tables.  I'll admit he was unhappy but she definitely did not handle the situation as a manager should.  I think the overall yelp 2.5 stars speaks to this, we are not alone in our dissatisfaction.  We will not be returning to this location and we hope the manager reads this and improves her site.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=500,2.04,2.4,2.484,1.7320000000000002,2.2560000000000002

We reserved table one day before and had Pizza and Pizookie for my office colleague birthday lunch.  We ordered Chicken barbeque pizza and Hawaiian pizza.  The pizzas were delicious.  As I am vegetarian I asked waitress to do half n half for no bacon on hawaiian pizza.  This place is amazing. Service was good. Our waitress refill the glasses as and when its about to over. After main course, we order regular size pizookie which is good enough for six people.    Also we told waitress that our colleague has birthday today, so she brought small pizookie with burning candle on it, that was so awesome.  Special treat for birthday boy ;) !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=380,1.8,2.3,2.48,2.484,2.1

298,Serena S.,"San Jose, CA",146,82,154.0,2.0,2015-09-05,"I've come to this Bj's nearly three times and still experienced mediocre (if that) service.  The first time I ever came to the Bj's at this location was for my friend's birthday dinner. We were a party of about 10, and we came in about 8:30/9pm. The hostess told us it would be about a 20-30 minute wait. An hour later, we STILL weren't seated. I get it, a big party is a big party. But why tell us 20-30 if we're going to be waiting around for an hour?  At around 9:50/10 we were finally seated, but it didn't even look too busy inside. We finally ordered and it took forever to get our food. The food didn't even come all at once, either. After 30 minutes just one person got their food. We kept asking our server repeatedly for how long it would take, and he never had an answer. The food wasn't anything special (to be honest I don't even remember what I got) and the whole time i was just thinking about how much money I'm wasting at this place. At this point, we just wanted the check. You think they could do that right? But no. We asked probably 3 different employees for the check. Just that took probably 20 minutes! By the time we were done there was nearly no other customers in the restaurant. I don't know if they were understaffed, or the servers were just clueless and new, but either way you could tell how poorly managed this place was. I don't think it was really the waiters fault, and I don't want to blame them but the management in general was just really really bad. Okay, the second time I came to this place was because my group of friends wanted a pizookie for dessert. I was skeptical about this place of course but it was a weekday night and the 6 of us were seated right away. All we ordered was a trio platter with two original and one cookies a cream. 10 minutes later, they come out with the wrong order, nice :-(. We only ordered one thing and it came out wrong!  I understand how things can get mixed up and I'm not rude about it at all, buuut all I can think about is how things never really seem to go as planned here, lol.  The pizookie was DELICIOUS if you know Bj's. I think that's what gives them 2 stars in itself. So this experience was better then the first but still, meh.  The third time I came here was last night. it was a Friday night so I expected it to be a little busy, but I didn't want to wait because I was so hungry. It was just me and one other person. We walked in and just saw the employees standing around that little table thing where the hostess is supposed to check you in. We waited there for probably 2 or 3 minutes before anyone even said anything to us. I was so confused, like wait did I go to the wrong place? Like aren't you guys supposed to acknowledge us walking into the restaurant.... Anyways, the lady says hi to us and tells us it's going to be a 20 minute wait for two people.  That's my cue to leave. I would've stayed if I didn't have that awful first experience of waiting for an hour. And I really didn't want to waste another hour waiting for my food.  I don't write that many bad reviews so I hope you know I'm being honest! There are plenty of other restaurants in downtown that could satisfy your cravings, and if you really want that pizookie just get it for takeout :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=280,1.68,2.3,2.452,2.184,2.052

We came in, I was giving my name she said the wrong name, I simply corrected the host, not a big deal, but she had to comment with an attitude ""Well yeah you're over there I couldn't hear you."" Ok? Yeah there was some distance, I was getting over a cold and I didn't want to be in her face. But that was unnecessary. We got to our table. We ordered our drinks and appetizers right away. We got our drinks and ordered our entrees. About 15 min we get our appetizers. Everything's going smoothly. Our waitress is consistently asking if we're doing ok. Once she cleaned up the empty plates that's where everything went downhill... After that, she never once came to our table to let us know the situation with our food. We kept looking at the time because I actually work graveyard so I wanted to make sure I had time. We were waiting close to an HOUR for our food. What made it even worse was that we were noticing people around us. FOUR TABLES WHO CAME AFTER US received their drinks, appetizers, entrees, and some had dessert as well while we were STILL waiting for our entrees. All we got were two small pizzas, ravioli, and a burger... My pizza was flat out cold/warm, probably due to the fact that they made mine first and it was just sitting there? I didn't want to send it back because who knows how long that would take. The guy behind us had ribs and other things, the table on the other side had a few people with full entrees dishes... The other guy who I noticed ordered while we were eating our appetizer received their food before we even got ours...And the other table were already eating their dessert and they were seated after us....

Surprisingly the food didn't take too long to get to us, but I didn't enjoy it very much at all. The salmon was for sure farm raised and tasted more fishy than it should have, not to mention the portions are not the biggest. The salad I had was actually really good, a little under dressed, but that's alright with me. The IPA was a little flat also, but still tasted fine I guess.

Last night we ordered the following: California Club (Flatbread Pizza Appetizer) 6"" Deep Dish Cheese Pizza (Kids's Menu) BJ's Brewhouse Blonde (Fish & Chips) Baked Beignet  Everything listed above came out perfectly. The flatbread pizza was had a nice crisp to the crust, and had just the right amount of cheese. The deep dish cheese pizza was good, but I felt it had a little too much cheese. I'm a little biased because I'm more of a thin crust guy. If you are a fish & chips fan, they use Pacific cod fillets, and skinny fries that come out with the perfect amount of crisp,  and with very minimal grease! The baked beignet was a little tough and chewy this time, so I wasn't a big fan. Side note: They don't have any ""free"" house bread. They brought 4 plates of bread, but charged us $1 per plate. The upside was the bread was really good, but you have to tell us that it isn't ""house bread"".  Maybe they can call it, ""dollar bread""? :P Conclusion: Great atmosphere, good service, good food. I'd definitely come back, but I wouldn't wait longer than 20 minutes for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=80,2.56,2.29,2.384,2.252,2.398

Let me tell you, my friends and I walked for the Alzheimer's association, afterwards we were hungry to we came here. You would think Santa Clara county excellent customer service right?! WRONG! We get there and the table still had the old check there I told the hostess and she's like ""oh your waitor will get it"" seriously? Just go give it to him you idiot we are sitting here! The waitor (Bryant) takes a lifetime to just even ask us for our drinks.... Then another lifetime to ask us for our food order. But this man is THE DUMBEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. So we put in our orders and we let him know my friend has a serious food allergy, she can't have dairy and he's like ok I got it. So she orders chicken wings and ribs and the lady brings out 2 orders of chicken wings and she tells her oh 1 chicken wing and 1 rib. And she apologizes and tells us she will take care of it. She did a great job. But here comes Bryant...... He goes ""did you not realize we had them in the wings?!"" And we were a little taken back so we all pause and I say ""but that's not what she ordered.."" And he goes ""oh but I got you don't worry I got you"" so ok we get our food the manager (John) brings us the ribs but at first he doesn't even know where she's bringing it and he looks around and we had to call him over.  Ridiculous!!! How do you not know where you're going?! I call the waiter for the check and my friend says she wants the pazookie but put the ice cream separate and our other friend will eat it. She asks him ""are there any chocolate chips in the cookie?"" And he says ""no"" so she gets it. This fool comes back with ice cream on the cookie and I go ""but there's ice cream on the cookie"" and the waiter yells ""DAMNIT!"" Completely inappropriate! Unprofessional! He runs back and comes back with the cookie and ice crea separate but the chocolate chips are melted all over on top of the cookie! Seriously!!! Wtf! Then I tell him she can't have this and he takes it back and comes back FOR THE THIRD TIME! WITH A CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE! At this point I'm done! So I ask another waitress, how is this cookie supposed to come? She said ""it's a sugar cookie with caramel on top and ice cream"" my other friend then orders a beer on the side from our waiter Bryant so she waits for that.. Then I ask for the manager... So here he comes... Looking like a doofus! Comes over unprepared and I tell him what happens and he then tell us he will bring the pumpkin pazookie for my friend we wait 10 mins and we are reading the sign.. The pumpkin pazookie has CREAM CHEESE! Jesus! The idiot waiter comes back and brings my friend her change for her beer... AND BRINGS HER THE WRONG CHANGE! HOW DO YOU DO THAT?! THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHAT THE CHANGE IS!! So the manager comes back and says ""well, I'm glad I didn't bring you that cookie because it has cream cheese"" well good job you should've known that in the beginning! And I tell him I don't want to see that waiter again you take care of this and return me my money for the pazookie"" and he's like ""oh did you pay for it?"" YES! WTH! WHY WOULD I SAY THAT IF I DIDNT! For Christ sake! And then we tell him the other waiter brought the wrong change and it literally took him 3 minutes to do the math in his head..... The beer was 6.25$ the change is 3.75$ not 3$! And here comes Bryant right after that conversation ""oh sorry I read the change wrong"" REALLY?! Terrible customer service, terrible management! And overall, The food wasn't even that great. We will never go back! And I told the manager he needs to inservice his staff and the cursing at the table was unacceptable! He wasn't even manager material! He didn't know what to say or do to correct the situation!

Not hard to find especially if you work there. They took my number just incase but said it wasn't there. I had called in a time frame where even if someone had sat there my purse would've still been there and unless that person had a huge bag with a zipper there's no way you couldn't see my glittery turquoise and white makeup bag.

I've done happy hour here too and was pleased with the food and drinks before. This last visit was the absolute worst.  First, my husband is on crutches and they tried to put us at a table in a walkway. Hello, you can see him on crutches clearly he's hurt so why would you put him somewhere where people walking by might bump into him and hurt him more?! I had to ask for a booth.  Then, our waiter was really pushy about getting our order in. In case you didn't realize, your menu is like a freakin novel, give me some time please. And he kept pushing us to order drinks or appetizers. We said no thank you. You're a server. Not a used car salesman. Calm the eff down.  Then, my husbands wedge salad was drenched in blue cheese. He couldn't even eat half of it. No one cared to ask how it was and just wisked it away once he appeared to be done with it.  Then, my sons order was wrong. He was served sliders and weird happy face potatoes. He ordered a burger and fries from the kids menu and it made no mention of the burger being sliders with quarter sized patties. Not to mention my food was under whelming. I had shrimp and asparagus pasta. Some of the asparagus and shrimp were so over cooked/old I couldn't chew through it, which explains why it was covered in sauce. And my husbands ""pepperoni"" pizza had no visible pepperoni.  Lastly the check. The server charged us over $20 for this simple pepperoni pizza with olives and basil. The menu said $14. Then server explains that we are charged per topping. If you're going to charge per topping then at least put a visible amount of it. And since when it cheese and sauce a ""topping"" on pizza? Isn't that a standard pizza ingredient?!  This is the perfect example as to why tipping should not exist. Servers only care about the amount of the bill and the amount of their tip, not about the people dining or providing good customer service. Shitty food and shitty service.

We talked to our waiter and he re-ordered the pizza. After it came, she was eating it and found a piece of sausage. YIKES. After examining it, we found a piece of chicken in it too.  So we made a big fuss. the waiter and manager were apologetic and said the kitchen staff was being lax. But, they had straightened them out. I was done eating so we asked for a THIRD pizza to go. The manager said he watched them make it to be sure there was no cross contamination. Well, you guessed it - that pizza had a piece of ham in it when she ate it the next day.

Drinks and Desserts: I've had hit and miss service with the drinks.  The communication between the bartenders and our waitress caused me to get the wrong order (ordered 3 different shots, got all of the same shot).  But they do offer a variety of beers and such.  I really like the beers where they'll combine 2 together.

If you like anything else, it will still most likely be here.

I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with gravy and potatoes -- which would have been better if it wasn't one spoonful of potatoes and one piece of chicken. Also, gravy drenched the entire chicken, so crunchiness + flavor = nonexistent. Service was also kind of inconsistent.

In terms of chain restaurants with large menus and a stunning dessert, I'll stick with Cheesecake Factory.  When we do go here, the wait is always long. Sometimes they even have tables and just lack the servers to seat people. And if there's a game being broadcast on the TVs all over the restaurant, you can be sure that the wait will be even longer.  Service is friendly, but can be slow. The menu is extensive, but nothing really sticks out as amazing. Maybe it's just that I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I just can't appreciate this place. Especially not when the beer costs as much as a meal. And the meals are pretty standard, if not slightly underwhelming for the price. One of the redeeming things about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the pizza-cookie, the pizookie. I like the pizookie trio, since you get the option of 3 different types of pizookies to try with some exclusions for the special items. While I'm still open to coming here, I can't say it's ever going to be my first choice.

Ok, well maybe I'm exaggerating a bit BUT when I order online and put a note that clearly says FOOD ALLERGY they should pay close attention. Ordered online for dine-in at 12:15. Somehow I live in a delusional little world where I think that ordering ahead of time somehow speeds up the process. At 12:50 the food finally comes but my daughter's sandwich comes with peppers on it (the ingredient I said she is allergic too). Sadly I work for the man (aka the government) so I only have an hour for lunch. The server takes the food back and says the manager is going to ""expedite"" the order. In the meantime my daughter gets to eat a plate of French fries for lunch, parenting fail. Server comes back to report the manager is going to comp both sandwiches (gee thanks). I asked for the sandwich to come back in a box because we needed to leave, oh and can we have the check please. Oh and the sandwich did NOT come back boxed. She says oh well since the sandwiches were comped do you still want to use your $10 reward. Yes, dummy I do because I don't think I'm ever returning so I might as well get my money's worth today. Now the check comes, wait for it.....Sure enough they comped the two sandwiches but then CHARGED me for the re-made sandwich. Are you sh*tting me! Then when I bring it to our server's attention, she clearly didn't understand so I had to speak to the manager. In her defense, the manager was very apologetic and did give us a gift card to use ""next time"".

263,Samuel H.,"San Jose, CA",45,9,1.0,1.0,2015-12-11,"This place is terrible! Everything is way over priced and over rated. The sandwiches come out soggy and they taste disgusting. The only thing I would recommend trying here are the avocado egg rolls but be warned they are not worth bothering to go here.  My experience with the hostesses has been horrendous! They are absolutely rude and unwelcoming.  Now for the service, I used to sit in the bar if there were seats available and I must say most of the wait staff are friendly and welcoming but once they great you that's going to be one of the few times you see them at your table - even when they're slow and don't have many tables. I'm not sure if they're in the kitchen chatting away or if they take a lot of breaks but you don't often see them. The menu has a ton of options but don't bother asking the servers what they recommend between the options your pondering because they're just going to tell you they're all good and popular - not very helpful.  The bar serves weak drinks and they're not really good at mixing, I mean how hard is it for any bartender to make a martini! Stick with the beer if you're going to go here and drink but be prepared to wait... AND certainly don't bother asking for the manager, they're absolutely useless and you'll see them way less often than the servers! Obviously they're terrible at their jobs, don't know how to hire or attract talented employees and they don't care about your experience.  The cooks come out of the kitchen sometime and they look dirty and frumpy makes you wonder about who's been handing your food..  It really is a shame I had high hopes for this place when they were going in so close to the rose garden. It was just a quick Uber away if you were looking for a hip place to relax on a Friday night and have some cocktails or beers with some friends. The BJ's in Cupertino next to Apple really has it dialed in a lot more. It really would be nice if this place could pull it together and figure out how a restaurant is supposed to work.

Impressive selection of beers and cocktails. Recommended ones: Strawberry mojito and Pink cadillac.  They have 'small bites' if you just want something light to munch with your drinks. Affordable yet yum. Try the Spinach stuffed mushrooms or Sriracha queso dips. Wate 3 things you must try here:  1. Signature Deep dish pizza - pick any flavor and it tastes oh-so-heavenly. Personal fav: Great white screaming cheesy chicken with alfredo sauce and roasted garlic - Awesomeness! You can build your own too! 2. New Orleans Jambalaya - House speciality with an exotic range of spices + Chicken + Shrimp served on pilaf. You can make it extra spicy and it will taste even better. 3 . Pizookie - Do not miss it for the wirld. Its the ultimate dessert - melting ice cream on an oven fresh hot cookie - Try the pizookie trio - sampler of 3 versions if you are a first timer. Personal fav : White chocolate pizookie with macadamia nuts. On top of all this great stuff, these guys are open until midnight which is a killer. Honestly im biased and i simply adore this place! They are consistently good and I just keep coming back! Tip: Sign up for a BJs membership card.

248,Sara T.,"San Jose, CA",347,356,2667.0,2.0,2015-12-18,"2 stars for this BJ's restaurant, because I'm annoyed with the hostess and their false waiting time. I came here yesterday (12/17/15) with a group of friends after graduation. There were 7 of us and they said it will take 40 minutes, which is the usual wait time whenever I come here. We were all very hungry, but we decided to wait and talk outside by the entrance. Like 20 mins later we decided to go in and ask how much longer, and she said it's still going to be a while, but if we want to sit outside, it will only take 5 minutes, so we're like sure! But like WTF, why didn't you give us that option first? So yeah that 5 min wait to sit outside turned into 10 minutes, and another 5 minutes, and another 10 mins and by that time I got angry cause everyone that arrived after us got seated before us? WTF. But seriously, can you get your estimate wait time correct? It's annoying when you give us the wrong time. I know I gave the hostess an attitude (and I apologize), but please give me a better estimate wait time? I would of been fine if you said one hour, but you kept giving us a false wait time :( don't say 5 min and get my hopes up...lolz. k. Bye. Besides that whole wait time issue...the food was good (just hoping they didn't spit in our food, since I was kind of rude)! The food wasn't like amazing, but I think we were all hungry, so we digged into our food!  Just a note, if you sit outside beware of bees, birds, and extreme cold or hotness. Not sure if I'll return to this BJ's location again ... I never had such a bad experience / wait time with this location and I been coming here for the past 2ish years since its near SJSU.

Ridiculous for anyone with kids and four doors. Once, we got over the 18 inches to slide out of the car we were greeted by a couple of workers who were barely interested in us and more interested in chatting with each other. Franchise looked like a typical BJ's. Food was typical and cooked like what I've had at other locations. Met our basic food need and was similar to what we expected from other stores. Had an older waitress who either hated her job or just did not want to work her shift. Can't recall if she ever smiled or even tried to make a pleasant remark even after dropping off the check for her tip.

The parking here is sooo much better than any other BJ's in the area. I haven't had bad experiences with horrible wait time estimates, but I do know it gets busy and I've had that issue with other locations. I like that I can get quality gluten free food here. Though it's no deep dish pizza ( which I love and miss here), the pizza is still good - though expensive because any toppings on a cheese pizza cost $1 more for each).  But thank goodness for hh, because these pizza fall under it.  My brother and dad shared the buffalo chicken deep dish small pizza which I think is the best too. My mom got a personal deep dish veg pizza and loved it, and it really was the perfect size for her. We usually get avocado rolls but we figured we had enough food tonight. The beers are wonderful, but I have to say I always get a mix of negative and positive experiences with the margaritas. Tonight I got the watermelon basil margarita which was horrible on so many levels, but I did get some Sprite and soda to get it less sweet, but still I would recommend to stay away from it. Lastly we ended off with a gluten free pazookie... Tastes just like the regular one!

214,Mac C.,"San Jose, CA",6,68,62.0,2.0,2015-12-29,"Wow. The management at this place sucks. The food is just ok.  So I ordered a hamburger. Medium well. The waiter comes by 20 mins after we place our order and explains the kitchen is backed up and if he could bring a salad out for us. Wife said sure and he brought her a Caesar salad. Another 5 mins roll by and my wife gets her meal and I get mine. I look at my burger. Part of it is burnt. I cut it in half and it is well done and completely dry. Also my fries are cold. He takes it. Offers a salad on the house I state no thank you. 25 mins go by. No sandwich. Another five go by and then I receive it. And it is now perfect. The waiter offers to bring me a salad for the inconvenience ($6.95) I said no think you and ate my meal.  After I finished I though hell if they were offering a free salad and I declined it, I might as well see if they take the appetizer off (5.95) I ask the waiter. He informs the manager. He comes back and the states the manager said no. I informed him it's the same thing as offering the salad. If anything I'm saving them about a dollar. I tell him to go back and ask her again.  She comes out and starts interrogating me. She asked was your food ok? I said yes. The second time but that isn't the issue here. She just stared at me all smiling and not a genuine one at all. It was a conditioned response. Instead of just taking off the appetizer she chose to come interrogate me first ask me questions and then leave without telling me what the point of her questioning was and without telling me what she was going to do! This was highly unprofessional! She ended up taking the burger off, so the bill was about $24. I left a $10 tip. As I wasn't trying to get something for free. Just trying to ask for what was already offered, but they ended up taking up more time for nothing. Anyway I think the guy sincerely did a good job and he shouldn't be punished for what the kitchen did. The chef should have made sure my burger was correct the first time rather than have me sitting there for such a long time and then wasting even more of it at the end with all the back and forth...

In short: there were some extremely rude inconsiderate customers before us who horribly affected our plans, and the management at BJ's did what they could to make up for it. I had reservations for my birthday at BJ's at 9pm, I was originally coming in with a group of twenty people. The way reservations work is that you're only allowed to stay two hours max. Unfortunately, the rude inconsiderate group before us decided to break that rule. My friends and I ended up getting seated at 9:50 pm because of those awful people. Because of this, most of my friends couldn't make it to that event, and I don't blame them, because just like me, they work 45-65 hours a week, and plus, we have school. What made my case even more upsetting was that I was also sick. To add insult to injury, those inconsiderate rude customers walked out laughing, and one of them just gave me a card that was only 20% off as her way of apologizing, and it was set to expire in two days. Unbelievable. By the time we got seated, I asked the hostess for some exemptions. The manager ended up coming out, and instead of granting the small requests I asked for, he gave my little remaining group and I an offer we couldn't refuse to make up for the horrible guests before us. Our server was also just as great. With that said, I will most definitely come to this establishment again. You can't always expect to be lucky thinking you'll have good guests who will be considerate of others, but you can at least try to make the awful situation less problematic, and that's what the manager, server, and hostess at this BJ's did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=340,2.04,2.17,2.284,2.228,2.1180000000000003

They told us that two tables were just finishing up so we would be seated soon, the wait was almost an hour and now I understand why. It took our server an HOUR just so she could give us our tabs. Like, seriously? She kept saying "" I'm coming! I'm bringing the check!"" throughout the course of an hour but would disappear and not bring it. Also, whenever we would ask another server for something he said he couldn't help us because he's not our server but if OUR server is not helping us then who do we turn to? After we are seriously about to walk out because we need to go and no one is showing up she finally brings the tabs and excuses herself with how ""it takes a while to print"". I have worked in a restaurant before and split checks, it does not take an hour, especially when it's dead. Overall extremely disappointed, I literally got the Yelp app just to write this review.

I decided to go here with my date since it was the closest one to us since it opened. This location is much smaller than the other locations I've been too but it is nice, and clean, and it's aesthetically pleasing and cures my OCD haha It wasn't too busy, went around 11pm on a Wednesday night. Plenty of parking in the plaza shared with Target, Panera Bread, Jamba Juice, and more . Located by Wingstop.  We decided on a Medium Sized Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza, Calamari to start and then ended it with a White Chocolate Macadamia Pazookie of course. Upon reading previous reviews, I was kinda skeptical since it said the service here was slow. It was not busy at all when we went but our server Ryan was attentive and nice. If anything I felt the food took awhile to come out. The calamari was good but damn, the size was so  small. I don't remember it ever being that small? Even the picture in the menu was like twice or even triple the size of that. It was expensive for 14-16 dollars :( (See picture for reference) The pizza was okay, not amazing. I've had deep dish here before but this one did not seem deep dish at all, more like a regular pizza but with a stuffed crust you would get from like Pizza Hut or something lol it needed more ranch and was sort of dry. For what it costs, i didn't think it was worth the 20 something bucks just for the pizza  The Pazookie was   as always. It was the winner of the night.  Thumbs up for nice staff, host and server.

I ordered the prime rib and it was everything but prime. As my side I got vegetables. They advertise fresh never frozen food, and the food was clearly frozen.

Had to wait an eternity to get a refill of water, and had it not been for a neighboring table asking for water, we would not have gotten it. We had no utensils or napkins to start, and that neighboring table had to borrow our ketchup, I only finished the veggies due to the fact that I haven't eaten all day. I decided to try to drown my steak in A1 to try to make it somewhat edible to no avail. So $35 is normally a decent price for a dinner for two, in this case it was a total rip-off and an epic fail.

I didn't catch her name but she had long hair and dimples.  My mom and I shared the honey sriracha brussel sprouts which were great. They weren't too spicy at all but gave just the right amount of kick to it. Portion size is good too.  The Cucumber lemonade cocktail was really refreshing as well.

We had called about a couple weeks ahead of time and reserved the patio. If you order food off their regular menu, they'll even provide complementary soft drinks. But we decided to go with the HH specials. All their appetizers and drinks are discounted. It's a chill place and service was decent considering the large size of our group. I had their mango beer. For the apps, I think we tried almost everything - ribs, wings, calamari, mozzarella sticks, sliders, egg rolls, chips & dip, potato skins, etc. I think the wings were the most popular as we got multiple orders of them.  However, there were some issues. Even though we reserved the patio, that didn't stop the restaurant from seating people in the patio area. It would've been ok if the other patrons were off to the side but they were smack dab in the middle if the patio. And then after about an hour, the restaurant started to get super busy and since we weren't using the whole patio, more people were seated around us. Which was fine, except we were occupying certain tables and the minute we stepped away to mingle, one of the patrons asked to move to that table. The restaurant couldn't say no (the customer's always right) and took away our table. Also it was a super sunny day. It's not a covered patio and there were not enough umbrellas for all the tables. Didn't even seem like there was enough for half the tables. So some people got really hot really quickly. Also I know they can't really help it but they're directly under the flight path for many planes landing/taking off at the nearby SJ airport so it got super loud at various points in the evening.

419,Anne L.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,1.0,1.0,2016-07-13,"I admit upfront that whenever I have dined at BJ's (this location and the one in Cupertino), it's under protest. I am often with others who want to patronize the restaurant for the beer and television. I just can't stand to pay money for consistently poor and slow service, not to mention average to mediocre food. Today I was outvoted by two family members, so BJ's it was. My elderly father who is recovering from major heart surgery and who had his first foray out in public, asked the hostess if she would move us (before we actually sat down and had utensils) to a different table. The one she originally walked us to was in a high traffic area and I know he felt skittish sitting there. With her back to my father but facing me, she made an annoyed/disgusted face and begrudgingly took us to a different table nearby. I then saw her walk back to the host station where she was clearly complaining about this incident. Perhaps she overheard me say to my father that we made her angry, but seriously? During our painfully long dining experience today, I saw this hostess in action; it was abundantly clear she should quit her day job because she can't smile, can't be bothered and doesn't want to be working. The same can be said for our waiter, who I know was not only exasperating to our table, but also to other diners nearby where I could see looks and chatter of annoyance over his inattentiveness and general cluelessness. As per usual, our meals appeared at different times. We were never asked how our meal was, but at least refills happened at least once. We spoke with friends who happened to be there today and they mentioned they will likely stop eating at BJ's on their lunch breaks because the service is very slow.  I know restaurant work can be grueling and thankless.

The burger was served with thin fries which were cold. We didn't receive the side of thousand island or an extra plate. In fact, there were no condiments on our table and we weren't offered any. By the time our waitress checked on us, the appetizer and burger had already been consumed. Both of our drinks were empty. I asked her for a side of thousand. She didn't ask either of us if we wanted another drink. After, the waitress takes another table's order before bringing me my thousand island. At that point, my bf requested the check.

We came in the evening around 7ish. The host was good though. She seated us within 5 mins and also noted down my rewards number and kept it on my table for the server to see.  The server was horrible and looked tired or sleepy (or maybe drunk). He took that slip and tore it immediately even though I had some $5 in rewards to be redeemable. I asked him why did you do that, he blatantly replied - b'coz you don't have any rewards. I didn't want to argue so I just told him to bring wate. He kept an expression as if we asked me for something that he doesn't like. Then I ordered Santa Fe Salad (which has ""blackened chicken""). Another employee brings the salad but when I started eating, I realized that it doesn't even have chicken. So I called the server and tells him that salad doesn't have chicken which it is supposed to have. Even without looking at my plate/and checking himself, He quickly tells me that he is gonna bring chicken in a bowl on the side. :O :O That was a surprise.  He brings ""grilled chicken"" (photo attached) in a bowl on the side (instead of replacing the entire salad dish with a new one). Then after just 1 or 2 mins, he walks past us in our aisle and just randomly asks us ""how are you guys doing? Do you guys need a to-go box?"" ... WTH !!!! We just started eating and you just brought the entree, how can you ask us if we want a box when we didn't even start eating. That was done deal for me. Stupid server with stupid attitude and I immediately thought that something is wrong with this server. Then after saying no, after 15 mins or so, we were just about to finish our dishes, this server just took away the plate from my friends side when my friend was just having a last bite of the dish he ordered and wasn't even done fully. That was pathetic!!! How can anyone do that. .. . We thought its not a good idea to think about it more and spoil our evening. So we asked for cheque. On the cheque it was written two santa fe salad ... one for 13.95 and another with chicken for $13.95+$3 = $16.95. That was another disaster. How can the server put in two salads when I ordered only one (which by default comes with chicken and costs 13.95). We tells this server and he says that he would have to ask his manager if the second one can be removed from the bill. He comes back and started asking me questions - whether I am sure the salad didn't have chicken. WTF!!! You idiot, when I told you about it, you didn't even take a look at it and just ran away by saying you will get me a bowl of grilled chicken. And now you are doubting it. I showed him the menu which clearly says that Santa Fe Salad comes with blackened chicken. Then He somehow got the bill corrected and we were surprised to see the entry - ""Customer recognition credit of -16.95"" .. .seriously!!! :-O :-O  Dude, first of all its your fault (or maybe chef's) that you didn't bring the correct Santa Fe Salad and then you show you did a good favor to me by putting up ""customer recognition credit"" instead of removing that entry itself. Infact since you didn't bring in the correct order, as some top-level restaurants do,  you should have given that salad for free. Anyways, it was a worst experience for me so far in BJ's.

136,Brandon Charlene D.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,2.0,3.0,2016-08-30,"Food: 4/5 | Service: 3/5  We went on a Thursday night, so we were seated right away since it wasn't crowded. Luckily, there was a Thursday promotion on baby back ribs: a salad and mini pizookie added. The babyback ribs already included two sides, in which we ordered the rice pilaf and french fries. Together, at a reduced price, we paid only $20.23 (with tax)! This amount of food was perfect for two.  We first got the caesar salad, nothing special. The baby back ribs was delicious; it had flavor both inside and outside. It wasn't overwhelmingly saucy - just the right amount. It soft and tender right to the bone! The fries were pretty good as it was seasoned well and had a nice crunch to it. Moving on to the rice pilaf, we strongly recommend that if you are looking for plain grains, then this is for you. It wasn't anything flavorful, but it was just there to balance out the flavors of the dish. If we were to come here again, we would not order the rice pilaf again however. The caesar salad came first as an appetizer and it was an enjoyable teaser while we waited for the main entree. Mmm, the pizookie was a delightful way to end the dinner as we had enough room in our stomachs to squeeze it in. It was served with vanilla ice cream on top that was melting as we took pictures of it.

Meanwhile, time is ticking for us to get to our concert. He came back 15 minutes later and asked for my credit card again to run manually since their system still wasn't working.

Very pleasant and efficient.  She checked in on us frequently and our beverages were refilled timely.   While still working on our dinner, our server asked if wanted to order desert.  Thought for a second, it was rather early to order desert when we haven't nearly completed the dinner portion but then I remembered it can take some time for the desert to be prepared.  We usually order a Pizookie but went with their Beignet topped with ice cream, whip cream and surrounded with strawberries.  The picture on the menu made it look so good, so we had to give it a try. There was an extended delay with our desert order and our server kept us updated on the status.  Just before our Beignet finally arrived to our table, our server informed us that she told her Manager about the delay and that our desert was free and on the house.

Food comes and my bison burger has pico de gallo on it after I asked for none when I ordered and my girlfriend's burger has two large cheese crisps (fried cheese) not specified on the menu in addition to the cheese that comes with the burger.  I return my burger to the kitchen with no apologies from Adrianna. Burger returned via another server. Burger is cold and someone dumped more sauce on top (can't taste the meat at all, just foodservice sauce that tastes between BBQ, teriyaki, and pineapple corn syrup).  Adrianna ignored us for at least ten minutes while taking orders at the tables on either side of us. No ""I'll be right back with your check"" not even a grunt out of her. She ignored the check three times to circle around and chat with other servers (we can see you) and finally returned to the table with only change in large bills after picking up the check.

236,Cuervo R.,"San Jose, CA",35,115,,4.0,2016-09-15,"Skimming some of the reviews, it seems like this location has some issues with consistency. But I've been to several others before, and always had at least a 3-star time. Last weekend was my first time at this location, and my best BJ's experience yet (didn't mean that as a joke, but I'll take it). Plenty of parking for Saturday dinner service, good space & atmosphere. Service was good overall, food & drinks were really, surprisingly good. I like to go along with a place's theme if I can stand it. But I just wasn't in the mood for beer at the brewhouse. Lucky for me BJ's has a nice selection of signature drinks besides beer. So I tried one of their crafted cocktails (black cherry something or other), followed by their cranberry cider. Both great choices. Our group got sliders & pizza to share, which were yummy. I also got maybe the best Caesar salad I've ever had, and the jambalaya I was craving. This is worth a special mention -- Caesar salad is not rocket science, and I've tried a bunch of 'em. Most of 'em are fine, nothing earth-shattering on the bad or good side. Some places really get it right, others really get it wrong. It's such a safe, simple dish I'm always amazed when I find a real standout. How do you make it taste so much better than the rest? How the hell do you manage to screw it up, let alone charge $$ for it?? Whatever BJ's does, lots of other places should be taking notes (Beach Chalet, I'm talking to you!). We had a really good time.

The dining room had a line so my friend and I picked the bar. After finding a seat we waited 10 minutes before being acknowledged by our server, Elijah. I can't pinpoint what exactly the issue was, but Elijah wasn't particularly friendly nor completely rude- so it's hard to give the service anything but ""meh"" ratings. The bar was visibly swamped so I understand the ""let's get to business attitude"" of service, but I didn't feel particularly welcomed as a customer. Since it was loud, our server seemed a little annoyed that my friend and I couldn't hear him and gave this awkward stare when we didn't answer his questions in a timely manner (due to background noise). The interaction was awkward and I've never felt so uncomfortable eating at a BJs.  The burger I ordered was waaaay too over cooked and dry. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger done and I can easily say it was one of the most disgusting burgers I've ever eaten in my lifetime.

They have a bunch of microbrew ""craft"" beer selections if that is your thing, and even have a microbrew root beer which is really excellent! Their dessert menu is also really good, including what they call a ""pizzookie"" which is a giant cookie that comes out hot with ice cream over it. Damn those things are really good. If you read my reviews and have been to this place, you know what my complaint is. The f*ck!ng music. Always always always blaring like really super loud to the point that you can't even hear the person sitting across from you. I really wish places like this would stop with the concert experience.

The bill came and they had added another extra dessert. Good thing we did not order food otherwise we would've stayed there till closing. We got the 730pm but didn't get to leave until 930 between all the confusion. There were other tables which seemed to have had the same issues.

DO NOT order takeout from this place!  If you're thinking, ""Hey, I'll just download the app, getting takeout should be fast/ easy/ convenient""... think again!  I ordered two entrees from here at almost 9:30pm and didn't leave there with my food until almost 10:30.  There is no reason it should take almost an hour for TWO entrees, especially that late at night.   So, I came in about 20 minutes after I ordered.  They said one of the entrees was ready but the other (pizza) was almost done.  I paid right then as I waited (with tip, almost 20% I might add).  I kept waiting and waiting... I finally asked how much longer and was told ""Oh, they messed up your food so they have to start over now"".  By this point I am irritated.  Why wasn't this communicated earlier?  So I ask what the problem was and she tells me that they used a different type of olive on the pizza than what I ordered.  I told her that I don't mind, as I'll eat any kind of olive and she says that it's too late- they disposed of the ""messed up"" pizza and started over.  Ummm... again, communication!!  If they had told me, I would have happily taken the ""messed up"" pizza!  She says it will take another 5-7 minutes so I step outside and come back about 10 minutes later.  I saw a couple employees behind the takeout counter and no one even acknowledged me.  The girl I had been communicating with was talking to her coworkers, ignoring me.  I finally had to interject and ask her if she can check on my food.  She disappears in the kitchen for about 15 minutes.  She finallyyyy comes out with the pizza and then can't find my other entree.  I mean, REALLY?! It was a small pizza and sandwich.  By this point it was reaching an hour.   I have worked in the restaurant industry in the past and I understand that things go wrong but so much of this could have been avoided with simple communication!   Also, not ONE person apologized to me or tried to make it right.  All the while, I saw many employees coming out of the kitchen with their personal food to take home or just standing around gossiping about their coworkers.  Not one person asked if I was being taken care of or needed anything.  At the end of this whole ordeal I asked to speak to a manager.  I waited a few minutes and see the manager coming from the parking lot with an employee who was (loudly) going on about wanting to quit.  Totally unprofessional!  The girl I had talked to about speaking to a manager then tells me ""he's busy with another customer, so you'll have to wait to speak with him"" (as he's walking past me).  I was so sick of WAITING at that point and my family was wondering what was taking so long, so I just left.  This place was a complete mess tonight!  It sucks because I live fairly close to this location, but it's just not worth the time and the headache to deal with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=100,2.48,2.48,2.372,1.956,2.48

Not even a single busser or other employee offered to get the plates out of our way. Even when our server took our order for desserts, she saw our plates and just walked away.  We had ordered two chocolate chip pizookies but was only given one. When we asked our server where the other one was, she looked confused as if she didn't confirm that we ordered two. My boyfriend said it was okay and that she didn't need to bring the second one out. She insisted there was ""another one"", yet we still waited 15 minutes for that one to come out.

Plus, my wife's food came 5-10 minutes before mine.   Strangely, all the waiters and servers are very nice, but the place does not seem to be managed well.  A friend of mine that usually goes to the BJ's in Oakridge Mall- in lives near it, walked out of this place because he got tired of waiting.  He talked to the manager that didn't seem to care.   I've have written to the corporate office, they don't seem to care either.  We go to the health club not far away and have, in the past, gone here because of the light menus.  I guess we will just have to quit again.

We ordered 1 original pizookie. When it came out, the ""ice cream"" on top of the pizookie was completely frost bitten and icey, clearly left in the freezer for too long. At this point we waited for our waitress to come around but she walked past our table like 3 times without helping us. I had to call over another waiter to help us.

85,Keith D.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,7,,1.0,2017-07-15,"This was such a disappointing experience. A couple few months ago, I went to this BJ's for lunch. I had the grilled cheese with bacon, avocado, and tomato. I've been craving it ever since. I finally had an opportunity to return for lunch. I went to order the same thing but couldn't find it on the menu. Jackie told me I could still order it. (You should it back to the menu.) I ordered the sandwich and requested that the fried be extra crispy. Jackie brought me by Tontonka stout and that was the last I saw of her. Sadly for me, she was given a party of at least 15 people. While she was taking their drink orders, someone else delivered my order. The sandwich was perfect and exactly what I remembered. The fries were soft, not extra crispy. But no one ever checked back with me to ask about my food, and I didn't get the chance to flag down anyone else either. At first, I thought I would just eat my sandwich, and then eat the fries after they were correctly prepared. I don't necessarily mind eating one item at a time. Sadly, by the time I was done with my sandwich, Jackie had just appeared with the drink orders. I was ready to leave by then. I had planned on ordering dessert, but I paid my bill via the app and left. Jackie was still handing out drinks. I did not get to eat the part of my order that I paid for (fries) and I did not get to order dessert. Very disappointing. Your hosts (and managers in this case) should never seat such a large party at the same time as a 1-4 top. The upfront work required for ordering guarantees that someone is going to get ignored--not from bad service, but simple logistics. It takes a long time to get take down drink orders and fulfill them. It can be even longer when it comes to the meal (though at least there's a gap while the cooks prepare the food). Please note that this is not necessarily Jackie's fault. The host slammed her and made it impossible for her to serve me well. If that large party and I had been seated an very different times, there likely would have been less interference with good service to both parties. The wifi didn't work either. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=40,2.28,2.43,2.396,1.988,2.37

I don't remember the last time I've been to a BJ's but my visit today reminded me why I've stayed away for so long!  This place has SLOW service! I think it took 30 minutes before our salads came and then another 15+ minutes until our entrees came. Overall, our group lunch (party of 7 people) took about 2 hours. The restaurant wasn't even busy to begin with!  Their menu is extensive but nothing really stands out - think of Cheesecake Factory menu size. Food here is a bit on the pricey side for the quality of food you are getting. They do have lunch specials towards the back of the menu if you're looking for something less pricey.  Since I couldn't decide what to order, I just opted for their lunch special (unlimited) soup and salad which was a little under $10. I got the mozzarella tomato salad and a bowl of the clam chowder. The salad was okay but on the small side compared to what I would have gotten if I ordered a different salad. The clam chowder tasted like something that came from a can. Even if I were to ask for another salad or soup, I think the wait would be ridiculously long so I didn't ask for another round, not like I had the chance to anyways since our server never came back. Their only somewhat redeeming factor was that it was FREE pazookie day! According to their website, each table was limited to one free order. We ordered a classic chocolate chip pazookie and the new churro pazookie. This took another 30 minutes so maybe put your order in ahead of time if you know you're gonna want dessert. The wait time was still ridiculous but I'm hoping that meant it was because they're freshly made.  The table behind us ordered their pazookie after us yet received it before us so we were suspicious that they mistaking given our order to them instead. When we finally received our pazookies, we were surprised to receive an extra churro pazookie due to their mistake. The chocolate chip cookie one was way too sweet and overwhelming but the churro one was actually pretty good. They had a stack of mini churros topped with ice cream. In the end, our server comped all 3 pazookies but that didn't make up for the rediculous wait times for our food. If this wasn't a special work lunch, I don't think I would have made it to work on time during my normal lunch hours.  Stay clear of this place if you can. Not even the pazookies are good enough for me to want to come back here.

Came here yesterday with the family and never actually stepped foot at this location.  It was nice and cool in here and great to deal with the heat wave hitting the Bay.  We were seated almost right away, but missing silverware, which they were ""low"" on.  Kinda weird to be low on silverware? I was able to get what I wanted to eat, which was a menu choice on their old menu. The burger melt is fantastic!

Anyway-- we got our food and the serving sizes were very small for the amount you pay. The salads that were served with all our entrees had a very sour tasting dressing on top. After that we asked if we could get a birthday cookie for His birthday. It took them another 20 minutes to get the dessert out... the ice cream was completely melted on it because they said the ""freezer was broken"".

We were told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait, so we asked if we could put our names down over the phone. The host put our names down, but when we got to the restaurant 10 minutes later, we were told that we would still need to wait 10 - 15 minutes for our table.  Once we sat down, the service was so slow, it was almost non-existent. It took forever for the waiter to get to our table (mind you, this was a Slow Sunday evening) just to take our drink orders. It also took forever for us to get our food. But that wasn't even the worst part. I ordered the jambalaya, and when I bit into the shrimp, it was raw! When this was brought to the waiter's attention he offered to re-fire another plate but I just asked him to bring another portion of shrimp in order to make it easier on the staff. This re-fired portion of shrimp literally came at the end of the meal when everything else on the plate was finished. Also, my boyfriend's Dad ordered a pizza and asked for light sauce because of how the acidity affects his stomach. He politely emphasized this when the waiter was reading back the order, but when the order finally came, it was with extra sauce!! Everyone else (we came with 6 people) didn't care much for their food either. Every plate that came to the table was cold which made the already bad quality food taste even worse.

Came for a friend's birthday and we had a party of 7 on a Thursday night after 7pm. We really liked our server, she made conversation and she was also funny. She was a true believer in servers making some kind of conversation with their tables or else, you'd be a boring server. All of our food came out at roughly the same time and there wasn't too much complaint for the food except there was a lot of oil in some of my table's pasta. My chicken Alfredo could have used more salt/seasoning though, but there was no trace of oil, thank god :) Drinks weren't too bad, the white peach that my bf had was quite sweet. BUT you could taste the tequila :) Also, they ran out of bread and the servers that brought out our food didn't advise us, we had to ask our server who explained more should be coming out and they probably ran out. Would have been nice to know when our food was brought out instead of pointing out that only one person had bread and 4 others didn't. Additionally, our server failed to notice that we didn't have utensils and still didn't realize this when our food was served. We had to flag her down and she came back with utensils for us, two trips. My plate was the only one who had utensils, but it was a spoon.. for pasta... Other than the missing utensils and waiting around for them, the atmosphere was loud and casual. Great company with friends, we got lucky with our server and surprisingly, the food wasn't all that bad and came out at the same time.  Best part of the night was their trio pizcookies!

25,Julie L.,"San Jose, CA",433,54,205.0,1.0,2017-10-27,"Why doesn't Yelp have the option for zero stars?  When I saw the ratings for this BJ's, I wondered why it was so low. After today, I realize that the rating should probably be worse. My rating of this establishment is based solely on the SERVICE presented by the hostess at 6:30pm today. Please note that I never even had the opportunity to dine before leaving this review. I learned through the grapevine that her name is Elyza? Alyza? She is an Asian female hostess.  I have been wanting a pizzookie all week for some reason (maybe because BJ's was target marketing me on ig). So lo and behold, after a long week of work, I decided to take my mom here to have her first pizzookie. We arrived around 6:30pm, where the hostess (Alyza/Elyza) told me it would be a 10-15 minute wait for two. She took down my name and I told her I'd be outside / around the area. So, I went back to my car to drop off some stuff, went to target to pick up an online order, came back within 10 minutes, and asked for my table. She asked for my name, and then asked, ""Did you get a text?"" I was very confused and told her that she never asked for my number for me to receive a text. She acted flustered/confused (so i'm not sure if she may be new or not), but proceeded to ask me for my name again. I told her, ""Julie. for 2."" To which she responded that she can't find my name in the system ""for some reason."" So she decided to play it off and add me in the system, while telling me it would be 10-15 minutes. Note that this is IN ADDITION to the 10-15 she originally quoted and it was clearly her fault that she did not put my name into the system the first time around.  I'm not sure what kind of system BJ's uses, but I've worked in restaurants before (and have worked as a hostess) and it literally takes a lot to mess something up that is as easy as putting someone's name/party in the system. I'd also like to point out that there weren't many other people waiting for a table at that time. If there were 10+ people waiting outside, I could probably see how that can happen, but when I came to put my name down, there were only 6 people at best.

The avocado bacon burger was average tasting. The monkey bread pizookie was OK. The vanilla ice cream was good but how can you go wrong with that? The monkey bread was like a hard Cinnabon. BJ has good beers at a reasonable price.  The only real positive note was we had a nice server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2,2.48,2.42,2.492,,2.444
28,Ronnie B.,"San Jose, CA",0,62,,1.0,2017-11-13,"""Shitty food, Shitty service"" should be the catch phrase to this place.  I took my parents and kids here for a bite to eat to take advantage of the veteran deal( What a joke that was$12.95 off). So we were seated within 10 mins of entering the building. But, or waiter was clearly not giving us the same attention she gave other tables. Took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks. Then after we ordered she messed up the special request I ask for the kids meal. So the kids no longer wanted to eat. I ask for extra sauce for my meal and by the time she brought it I was almost done eating my nasty meal which had no flavor.  I Don't think ill be going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2,2.48,2.41,2.488,,2.438

185,Amy A.,"Austin, TX",87,23,3.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"I am a female who visited your location, dining alone I chose to sit at the bar. It was busy so I patiently waited before the bartender took my drink order and offered me a menu. A female bartender joined the male bartender who previously tended to me. The stood at the opposite end of the bar visiting as he prepared drinks. She was more interested in flirting with the busy male bartender to notice the patrons. When they looked at my end of the bar I raised my hand to signal I was ready to place my order. They returned to their personal conversation giving no indication they acknowledged me. The female bartender eventually sauntered down and offered to take my order. I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare. When the meal arrived the steamed broccoli was cold in spots and the mashed potatoes were firm, not fluffy, and lukewarm. The medium rare steak I ordered was well done and dry. I let the bartender know the meal was disappointing but chose not to send it back because I was too hungry to wait for another meal to come out. Later the bartended asked if the manager came out to talk to me and they had not at that point. I was in a call when someone finally decided to come talk to me, but I let them know I was on the phone. The man apologized and left but never came back. I've waited about 20 minutes and still no one has come to talk to me about this awful experience. I shall not return to this BJs location. The service is poor and the food was less than stellar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2?start=60,2.6,2.43,2.492,,2.498

Thirty minutes later I walk in and ask the hostess with drawn on black eyebrows and dark lipstick how much longer for our party of 5 and she tells me we're next. Shortly after a party 8 is called and then I ask my bf to go in and ask again, this same girl tells him there's a party of 5 ahead of us. How does that make any sense!?!? So I walk in and tell her--you told me one thing and him another, what's the deal? She had no explanation so we literally just walked out. Headed to Red Robin! Horrible customer service.

20,Christine B.,"San Jose, CA",59,125,54.0,4.0,2017-12-05,"This is your typical chain restaurant/brewery. I've been here for a couple good happy hours and some dinners while out doing errands. The happy hour is a great setup with good options and prices. I believe you can only get it while sitting in the bar, so be sure to ask to be seated there if you want to take advantage of the deals.  I've been here a few times, so the services has varied in its quality. The last time I visited, the server was great. He was attentive, helpful and friendly. But I've also had experiences where the servers have gone missing and I've had to ask other servers for assistance. So I think it really depends on your luck in who is assigned to your table.  The food has always been good. The beer is really good too and there are lots of options. The pizookie is their famous dessert. I had a bite of one the last time I was there. They are VERY good, but the calories are a little scary. They're listed on the menu, so no surprises there! There are lots of TVs, so the sports nut in your party will be happy too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2,2.4,2.46,2.492,,2.436

There were a few hiccups with some of the orders and a few plates came out cold. I was frustrated and asked to speak with a manager. Fredrick Greenleaf came and apologized to our table. He did a fantastic job of offering solutions and going above and beyond with the customer service. Even after the ice cream machine went down, he sent his employee across the street to target to buy ice cream so that we could still enjoy our pazookie. Talk about customer service! If this guy is still working there he deserves a raise and a high five.

I don't know why they cannot put 2 tables together. This place is absolutely ridiculous! They should not let their customers wait this long. Finally we were seated at a booth which can seat 4 people comfortably but not 7. I asked if they can put a table next to it but they don't have a table. I asked to speak with the manager and he came right away. I asked him if he thinks all 7 of us will be comfy eating dinner while we were squeezed like sardines. Suddenly a table materialized to accommodate all of us. No silverware and napkins. I had to request to get them so we can eat the appetizers. Never ever going to this place again!

There was a mix up and they seated us after some people that had arrived there after us. We were seated and placing our order around 10pm. There was yet another mix up in the kitchen, and we only got our food at around 11pm. I had some shrimp pasta and the food was at room temperature and there was hardly any shrimp in it.

I got the chicken club sandwich and it wasn't the best sandwich that I have eaten. The chicken was a bit dry and the sandwich kept falling apart. The fries were just fries. One of my friends ordered sweet potato sides to sub her regular fries, but they gave her regular fries instead. She let the waiter know, but it took a long while to get the correct fries. We had to ask for water refills a couple times and were checked on 1-2 times through the 2.5 hrs we were there. After our main meal, we decided to order pizookies because they are $3 on Tuesdays.

21,Kalen K.,"San Jose, CA",128,285,14.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"BJ's as a chain is really not my favorite spot in general, but the kids love their pazookies and you pretty much know what to expect when you go to one. And this location is right on par. Super slow service and predictably lame execution. Ordered an Iced Tea Lemonade (aka Arnold Palmer, I actually said both just to be extra clear)...got Ice Tea. Asked for no cheese on pizza and extra sauce (because no cheese sort of requires extra sauce to hold it together - which we laughed about with the server) and got no sauce. Pizza wasn't cut through so had to carve it myself, requiring me to ditch that hang in the air stand, which prompted server to come over and check on us. She was very bothered by us not using the pizza stand and actually put the pizza back on the stand. Since she was there, we asked for a side of extra sauce since none was on the pizza. Of course, she never brought it. She did eventually bring our check after we flagged her down. Granted, she was over seated. And she was friendly. The kitchen certainly didn't help her and the host wasn't doing her favors by piling more people in her section. But, like I said, you pretty much know what to expect when you go to a BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose-2,2.44,2.45,2.496,,2.446
