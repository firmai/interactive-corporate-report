84,Maria M.,"Denver, CO",0,83,,4.0,2012-05-17,"I can't believe I'm writing this review since I'm far too much of a snob to admit eating at a massive national chain.  Never say never, right? My kids wanted to go to Friday's in Northfield for dinner last night...thank you television advertising.  After much deliberation of other alternatives the hubs and I gave in.  We were very pleasantly surprised at everything. The service was prompt, attentive and friendly on all fronts.  The place was busy but not overly loud.  While the menus at these places are overwhelming, we were all able to find something without too much brain damage.   Hubs had a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  The fries were great and the burger was cooked medium rare, just as ordered.  I had the Korean Steak Tacos which were actually excellent.  The steak was plentiful and tender and they were dressed with the perfect amount and combination of lettuce, cucumber and cilantro.  Even the rice on the side was good. We both had side salads, which were fine.  Nothing great but not bad either.  The kids both had chicken strips and fries.  First off, they were huge, enough for lunch today, and they were quite good.  Since that's all my kids tend to eat when we go out we consider ourselves chicken strip experts.  These were meaty with just the right amount of crispy coating. Our water glasses were topped off regularly and the kids lemonade's were as well.  The dessert the kids got was good too - dirt cups, or something like that.  We'll definitely add Friday's to our arsenal of family restaurants",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=100,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

Last night was extremely loud, which really made it difficult to even have a conversation with the friends I was with.  Everyting we said had to be yelled across the table. Apparently they were having a trivia night in the bar area, while we were in the dining area.  The announcer and the music were so loud that I really did leave there with my ears ringing. Overall, it's an ok place that is open late, even during the week, so if you're looking for a place to hang that won't kick you out at 10pm, and you don't mind the noise (or you like trivia night), this would be a great choice for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=80,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

89,Frxa M.,"Commerce City, CO",3,12,2.0,2.0,2012-10-30,"Vistied this store on 10/30/12 12:30 during lunch with my dad ( he visits 1-2x a week). We were sat by the kitchen, so we could hear every word the servers and people on the line were saying. Our server was Heather, who was extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. The food we ordered came fairly quickly, and my ribeye was cooked a perfect temp. With that being said, my problems came from ordering one of their slushy drinks, and recieving a small black bar straw that made it impossible to drink this particular drink. When I asked the female bartender if they had any normal sized straws and she looks at me like im crazy and simply says ""no"" I again asked her If they had any restaurant sized drinking straws to drink this with, again, the answer was simply no. Sorry. Now my problem was with her attitude, her lack of caring or sympathy for my problem, and her apparent lack of respect for me as a customer. No ""yes sir, no sir"" was used,  she talked as though I was annoying her and she couldnt be ""bothered"" by a customer since she was so ""busy"" talking to the male bartender and taking care of her empty bar. (Apparently she doesn't realize the turnover rates of rude bartenders) I said ok, walked over to the fast food place, and got a bigger straw.  Why is it that most kids working at restaurants these days have zero manners, no respect for customers, and look like they would rather be anywhere but at work. Find more servers/bartenders like heather, and I might go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=100,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002
62,Michelle S.,"Denver, CO",109,423,,1.0,2012-12-26,"I used to spend weekend nights at Friday's ever week when I was in high school (in the 90's)I suppose there must be a reason that in the past two years I've been to  Friday five times or less and after today I can say I will never be coming back.  Every time I've been here I have been less than impressed and today was the straw that broke the camels back. Walking into the restaurant was challenging because of the giant group that was seated at the front. I had to squeeze through and I am average sized and I still bumped into both chairs on either side of me. To me this is annoying and a huge safety issue if there were to be a problem inside it is single file lines out of the dining area. Yikes.  We get seated and I take a seat in a chair with my back to the ""aisle"" and within the first 5 minutes of sitting there my chair has been jostled no less then 10 times by people trying to get in and out. Absurd.  Service was the slowest thing ever. A freaking turtle could have brought me my beverage (sodas and iced teas at our table, nothing from the bar) 10 minutes is about 8 minutes too slow.  We all order the lunch special (unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks) Unlimited sounds nice, I usually like to indulge in two bowls of soup (gasp! I know) However we sat around at our table after finally ordering our food and we never saw our server again. It took at least 20 minutes to get said soups and salads to our table and then at least 10 minutes to finally track down our server to get our bill. Which of course turned out to be wrong because we got charged for drinks.  We were here for over an hour and had a bowl of soup and salad. I could have gone to Panera and had a much more enjoyable experience.  Goodbye Fridays, we're officially broken up.

I and a few friends stopped in for ""all you can eat soup and salad lunch"" it sounded   okay when my friends suggested it, we were not real hungry and wanted to eat light but healthy. I ordered chicken tortilla soup with Caesar salad, the soup was thick, very thick, and tasted of tomatoes with soggy tortilla chips on top, unappealing in the extreme, salad was nothing but chopped romaine and a few halved cherry tomatoes, a couple slices of some mystery cheese with hint of salad dressing.  I could not taste the dressing there was so little of it, I thought they sprayed it on the lettuce, between the sludge they called soup and the boooooooring salad with no tatse of Caesar dressing I must rate this meal as a fail.

Happy hour here has a good selection of wines, beers and drinks at a discount, and also some good food items. Join the Stripes club. Points add up fast and then there's free food (they're generous).

I honestly felt cramped , uncomfortable sitting in the booth. We ordered some cheese sticks, and they fell kinda flat. One cheese stick was completely hollow and had nothing inside. There wasn't enough sauce for everyone and they put parmesan cheese all over  the plate..weird . The kids ordered a chicken basket and my boyfriend ordered a hamburger. He requested medium and honestly, it was raw . He didn't finish it but I couldn't blame him, it was nasty. I ordered the parmasan chicken and was let down with the plate presentation and the portion size.  I basically felt I was served a chicken-style hamburger (granted a very flat hamburger) encrusted with crunchy breadcrumbs that had no flavor. The chicken wasn't overcooked but it did have a few nasty bits that I had to spit out . I had a cherry tomato side salad and I found a strawberry in it, guess that slipped by someone. I had a side of macaroni and cheese and it was ok, pretty much microwaved cheese on top of a basic macaroni . There was barely any in the dish though. When I looked at the kids baskets they seemed to have way more then my adult portioned dish. When we looked at the bill , roughly $35 I felt even with the 1/2 off appetizers things are way overpriced . Basically I felt $10 out of my pocket was well worth it, but will I make a return visit? No .. there are far too many other places I would much rather go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=100,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.088,3.1200000000000006

The last time we were there the food was way over priced and bland.  Well it was the same this time prices were better but food was bland. My son had a triple decker burger of some sort he said that the patties were the size of a McDonald's burger and even though he ordered them rare they came out hockey pucks. I had the parm chicken. It tasted boring. My son tried it and said it tasted like an old tire.  The mac and cheese was equally as bad. I poured salt on it to get some flavor. My son is very sensitive to salt and he tried it and said he didn't believe I had put any on it. We did have desert the Oreo cookie which was fairly good but came out with freezer burn on one side. The place hasn't changed much bad tasteless food. I think they lowered their prices cause it wasn't horribly expensive like the last time.

The staff was very friendly from the beginning, so immediately, we fell in love. Today was also the big Bronco/Raider game so they were busy, however the staff was very calm and collected instead of rushing around. The prices weren't too bad, typical prices for a chain restaurant, $8.50-$16 depending on your meal. The portions that they give you are big, in my personal opinion.  I couldn't finish my meal, but the quality of it was very good.  The tomato and mozzarella is definitely recommended as a side.

We took a seat next to the bar and we ordered some steaks. Julie was our server but she hardly attended us. No refill on our drinks, it was horrendous. She only gave us our food and even left.

We were sat right away and the hostess walked away then came back about 30 seconds later and asked for our drinks, so we thought maybe she wasn't the host and was going to be our server. We both got waters with lemon because it was 95+ degree day. We never got the lemons, so I asked again and the girl walked away. A couple minutes later another girl came up and offered to take our order, I ordered the small size of the potato skins and was even on the page for the miniature apps and pointed to it as well, then order my JD burger, I asked if I could have it Medium and she smiled and said yes. So then she leaves and it was about 10 minutes for our app, brought by someone else, we didn't have any silverware still, so I had to ask for that, then another 15 minutes go by and our burgers finally come brought by someone else again. They asked if we needed anything else and I asked for a box for the skins, and a refill on water since we haven't seen our waitress in the past 25 minutes. He takes our glasses, and I cut my burger in half and it is well done and dry as leather, I'm starving and didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for a new beef patty. So I finish one half of my burger and the guy still hasn't been back with our waters, ten minutes later or the box. Finally I see our waitress and say the guy never brought our waters back and she walks away without a word and brings us new waters with attitude as if we asked her to do 100 push ups. She never asked how anything was, and we just wanted to leave and I had to stop yet another person to get that box. Then I had to ask for the check. 5 minutes later I finally got it, and she had put the full size potato skins on the ticket and put my burger as ""no pink"" I thought it may have been the kitchen that just cooked it a little longer, but it was totally her fault, umm, excuse me, but medium has substantial pink to it. I asked her if she could switch the skins to the $4 ones and she acted surprised, Oh! You wanted the smaller ones?! So she just removed them. I gave her my card and a couple minutes go by and I finally got it back. It takes really bad bad service for me not to tip, but in this case I just couldn't. Our server practically didn't do anything for us. I shouldn't have to ask for everything twice, silverware, check, boxes, refills. Sorry but you earn your tip.

98,Karin J.,"Aurora, CO",43,10,,1.0,2016-07-15,"Most recent visit (today) is up there on my top 5 worst customer service experiences I've ever had, let alone at a restaurant. You would think on a Friday at lunch time, they would have staffed their A-team (God, I hope this wasn't their A-team), but it felt like their X, Y or Z team. My party showed up at 1:00pm, and was quickly seated, I was a little later arriving at about 1:10pm. When I sat down, my party (only 2 other adults besides me), had their water, and an appetizer came out shortly after. Great! Things were looking good. We all knew what we wanted pretty quickly after I got there, and made it obvious by setting our menus down and chatting with each other. 10 minutes later, nothing. So my friend told the waiter (who was at the computer directly behind us), ""Hey, we are ready to order when you get a chance."" The waiter, Christopher, said ""okay, just give me a second to drop off these tickets at a couple tables."" okay, no big deal, I get it.... he's busy. He then proceeded to chit chat with EVERY table in his section. Meanwhile, a manager comes by and asks every table around us how the service is.... but us. Okay, he'll be back, we'll talk to him them. We wait another 15 minutes, and he comes back to the computer and hears us say something about how I have to get back to work by 2, and he says ""I haven't forgotten about you, I promise."" He drops off ANOTHER ticket to a table, and comes back to get our order. I was a little short with him, as this is my lunch break, and I should be leaving to get back to work in 10-15 minutes.  Then we wait, and wait all the while he is chit chatting with all the other servers in a big group by the kitchen, the manager in there with them. Laughing, and not even checking for our order. My 15 minutes left on my lunch hour is gone by this point, and I pulled him aside (when he was just walking passed), and asked him to put my lunch in a to-go box and bring me the receipt, as I was already late. He says ""k"" and walks away. Then the food comes, but not my to go box for another 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, NO ONE comes to see how the food is, if the orders are correct or even bring my party silverware. Unacceptable. I know you may be busy, but don't fool me into thinking you are too busy to show us even fair customer service, while you are chatting it up with every other table. Finally  get my food and as I'm walking away I hear someone from my party for dressing.... apparently that was forgotten too. So, now my food is in the fridge at work, meanwhile, I'm still hungry. TLDNR: Do not go on a lunch break if you have a strict time limit at your job.

On April 8th, 2017, we arrived that the TGIF location in Stapleton, CO. We sat down at our table at 6:40pm. We waited patiently as 10 minutes passed. The restaurant was not busy, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt that something may have come up. At 6:50pm, we were a bit frustrated at the lack of service, and noticed another table of 4 ladies got so frustrated that they got up to leave. Finally, at 7:00pm, we got up to leave as well after waiting 20 minutes for a server to take our drink order. Allow me to remind you that the restaurant was not busy. We asked to speak with the manager to inform him of the poor service. He did not seem to care and appeared to be in favor of the ""poor service"" culture. We live next to this location and visit at least once a week. The service has always been bad, and that can be seen by the very low ratings on Yelp, Facebook and Google. However, this experience was the cherry on top, and we will no longer be visiting any TGIF location. The male manager with pierced ears was not genuine and did nothing to save the consumer relationship. If you happen to be here, and this manager is on duty, I would avoid speaking with him. When someone comes into your restaurant once a week, the least he could have done would have been to express sincere apology. I would encourage you to read the reviews for this location on Google and Yelp. The reviews are powerful and are clear that this location is not consistent with brand standard.  It is sad that this location will probably face no real consequences of how they treat loyal customers, but sharing this negative experience with you is worth a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.7640000000000002,2.64

Secondly we did not get greeted if she just stared at us and I told her we are here to eat. She looked at me and said ""for how many"" I told her just us pointing to my party she said ""well how many is that"" but she said it so freaking rude. Then She said well ""we're really busy right now there is no table for you guys"" I asked her how long is the wait, she replied ""I don't know, you really want me to sit you guys""? And she was very rude with that comment. I honestly feel like she was being rude for no reason. She didn't look around for seats she just told us it was going to be an hour. I'm not sure what the problem was here but the manager was just as a appalled as I was. She said they would take care of me on my next visit, I don't really care about that this place needs to have either better training or more friendly staff because the way we were treated was unfair and totally uncalled for I will not visit this place anymore.

What a super deal after shopping all day in the mall area. I ordered pot stickers and meatballs. The other ladies ordered wings, mozzarella sticks, nachos and potato skins. The potstickers where good. The meatballs were cold. The boneless wings had an odd texture like gristle and fat combined. The nachos never came out and the potato skins where tough-unedible. We tried to make the best of it and order some other options. After 20 minutes of waiting our 2nd order come out. The potstickers this time were drenched in oil and the jack daniels wings were awful tasting. We enjoyed the company and the conversations so it wasnt a damper on our evening.

We settled up, paid out bill and went our way. I later noticed my account had been charged $60 over my bill. No big deal-just call and get an explanation. Everyone at my table but me paid in cash. I spoke with the manager Rob. He was horribly rude. I am glad he didnt come to our table with this awful attitude. His tone was impatient. He cut me off mid sentence to tell me 'thats a lie' because they haven't downloaded credit cards for the night. I was told it was a hold on my card thru my credit card company the issue wasn't with theirs. I explained it wasnt a 'pending' action it was an actual charge. He said he didnt know and couldn't help and hung up. It was his tone and the horrible manner in how he handled the situation that caused the entire evening to sour. The host and our waiter were fantastic. The food was horrible. The time frame it took to get our food. Horrible. We didn't receiver refills on our drinks despite asking several times.
