Brittney C.,"Atlanta, GA",27,79,125,5.0,10/21/2017,"Okay as you all know I've went to the one in Dunwoody for my final time . Because it's still a favorite of mine I went to north point 10/20/17. It was great! Went with 3 friends. We ordered the bbq Pizza (their signature pizza), the sausage and mushroom pizza, strawberry lime margarita, and some of their fresh coolers. The drinks are usually about 10.00  My other friend tried the jambalaya which she thought was good. I love love love the butter cake. It's my favorite. The staff was very attentive. Not Sure if they were switching shifts because we had a different waiter/waitress. None the less, it was perfect. Food was bomb! Lots of laughter and fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta
Eric H.,"West Hollywood, CA",34,12,,5.0,9/25/2017,Total great experience! Food absolutely on point. Nice clean restaurant. Have been to many CPK's all over the country and this was definitely one of the best.  I have to say what made it extra nice was the service. Our server KK was so engaging and fun.

Andy M.,"Alpharetta, GA",14,20,7,2.0,1/4/2018,I truly enjoy pizza but did not have a good experience. I felt it was overpriced and not the quality that I had hoped for. We hadn't eaten at one of these in over 10 years. I remember why now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,389,4.0,10/18/2017,"CPK is a chain, but their quality is consistent. From the Sangria to Veggie pizza, I was having a good time.

Nikki N.,"Atlanta, GA",12,45,25,2.0,9/3/2017,"I came here the other day with a friend and ordered the orginial bbq chicken pizza that comes with; bbq sauce, smoked gouda, red onions and fresh cilantro. After waiting quite a while for our pizza to arrive, it came out burnt and tasted just like a pizza hut/papa john's pizza.

Doug B.,"Alpharetta, GA",18,117,95,5.0,9/22/2017,"We had not been to CPK in a long time. I think that we had been raptured by Crust. So we came here to celebrate our 300th monthaversary (25 years) together. Still on our 3rd date!  We were offered seating on the patio and being such a perfect night - we did. Our server was an incredible young lady - Naomi. What a lovely lady with a great attitude and spirit. Best service we have had in a long time. Thanks Naomi! After devouring a fresh Ceasar salad and a petite wedge salad with applewood smoked bacon we greeted our entrees. I savored the Chicken Jalapeño Fettuccine with extra garlic and red chili flakes. It was a scrumptious blend of flavors. My lovely wife ordered a Margharite pizza. Thin crunchy crust with big basil flavor.  The hefty portions means yummy leftovers for tomorrow. We thoroughly enjoyed the CPK dining experience. Nice ambience on the patio, exceptional service by Naomi and filling, flavorful food.

Michelle R.,"Alpharetta, GA",37,55,22,3.0,4/16/2017,CPK is a national chain with a variety of options from pizza to pasta to salads. It's a simple menu for the most part and the service is always friendly.  My favorite pizzas are the BBQ Chicken and The Works. The price-point ranges from $10-15 for the pizzas which serve a hungry one or a health-conscious two :)  Don't forget to try their cocktails as this location makes them strong and almost worth the $8-11 price tag.  They have a customer loyalty program called Pizza Dough for those who love freebies.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta
Cassandra R.,"Roswell, GA",0,4,21,5.0,6/16/2017,"I had been wanting to eat the food of California Pizza Kitchen for so long. The thought of tasting a gourmet pizza of this type that is not like fast food pizza whether Cici's Pizza or Papa John's or Little Caesar's.  In addition, I was a little excited to be around a more upscale atmosphere that I don't know, I just got the feeling the place exuded when I would pass it by. Was I right! I made my way there as a second option I was wanting to try out when Dave & Buster's loud and inattentive service failed to impress me.  Still good for me because I wanted so badly to try one of their gourmet pizzas and eat either some cheesecake or red velvet cake which I researched they served.  I'm a quiet person and like to keep to myself so preferably I want a restaurant that is quiet & low-key. Especially as I am simply there for the food. And I want to savor every morsel. Slowly too, just so that I can taste it fully. And as a matter of fact I can't understand people who go to restaurants with big parties since if you are socializing, how are you enjoying your food? I would never do it since if I'm going to restaurant it is for the food and nothing else. Not even to talk or chat with the waiters.  Anyway. I was tremendously glad when I arrived at around 8:45 PM give or take, that the atmosphere of the place was quiet and was pretty elegant looking. Even the outside with soft yellow lighting which contrasted wonderfully with the building. Right off: impressed. Next since I have never dined at a casual dining restaurant of the scale of California Pizza Kitchen I was a little worried to how I will approach someone about getting seated. It was not hard at all. I got seated (I mentioned yes I was dining by myself) and was told Breanna would be my server although I was assisted by her assistant, Kate.  And Kate was really nice and did a terrific job though she said she was still relatively new as a server. I thought she was very attentive and nice. Especially as she left me to my own devices to enjoy my food and would still come assist me when I needed to ask something.  But let's get on to it. What was my response to California Pizza Kitchen's food at Alpharetta GA North Point Dr? It was delicious and just as I imagined. First off the Strawberry Mango Cooler I ordered was so refreshing and sour. Perfect! I love sour flavors. Next, the red velvet cake was incredibly soft, creamy, and moist. Definitely tasted better than store-bought. Oh, and before I forget the red velvet cake can be served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream at no extra charge. Wow! That's amazing! Finally, the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza was very mushroomy. It was on the organic-tasting side even though I ended adding salt and black pepper to it since in my opinion it needed better seasoning. Don't get me wrong. It was good but it needed more zest. I'm a huge believer that seasonings and spices add more flavor to food.  In any case, I was truly impressed by the attentive service and delicious food including the pizza. I certainly recommend and, of course, I myself will be returning to the restaurant whenever my top favorite musician TK from Ling tosite sigure announces an upcoming music release. As a way to celebrate that he'll be releasing new music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta
Sandeep G.,"Alpharetta, GA",37,214,6,3.0,1/20/2017,Ordered a take-out and scheduled to be picked-up at 6:00 PM. Reached around 6:05 and the order was ready and the transaction was quick and courteous. I had ordered 2 Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizzas and spicy cauliflower. The Cauliflower was good but not too impressed with the Pizzas. The topping was scanty at best. It was hard to find the chicken on the Pizza. The pizza was just warm when I reached home which was just about 15 minutes drive forcing me to believe that the pizzas were ready much before the scheduled pick-up time of 6:00 PM. $ 13.99 for a warm-cold pizza with minimum toppings is not a great deal in my mind!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta

Ramesh B.,"Alpharetta, GA",15,19,2,4.0,11/10/2017,"Oldie is Goldie. After almost 20 years, my wife and I decided to try this restaurant in North Point Mall in Alpharetta, GA. We ordered soups and three appys to share instead of traditional pizza, that is what they are known for. My wife ordered Dakota Pea and Barley soup. She enjoyed. I ordered a bowl of Southwest tortilla soup. Soup was good but not very spicy for my taste. It was warm but I like my soup real hot. The 3 appys we ordered were: Buffalo Cauliflower, Avacado egg roll and roasted peppers. Enjoyed all three. However, cauliflower dish was the best superb and tasty. Roasted peppers were not hot but had a kick. Avacado Egg Roll was a little tame. On the whole it was a great eating experience in a place we last visited some 20 years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta
Ssd P.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,42,7,3.0,2/11/2017,"Loved the Jambalaya Fettuccine it's a big hit and just indescribable awesome, also ordered the charred shishito peppers not hot at all absolutely loved it.  However the guacamole dip and chips were a miss the quantity of the dip was so minuscule most of us just ate plain chips no dip.  On a happier note again ... must have is the Brussel bacon flatbread. And the wild mushroom strozzapreti was delicious  However the service sucked we were not offered or given bread and dip which is usually served and the server vanished even though we had asked for water came 20min later . Food great service of this specific server not good had him on 2 specific occasions and both the times he had forgotten something.

Jing L.,"Atlanta, GA",332,138,495,3.0,11/7/2016,"First time at this location. My friends and I decided to drop by since we went shopping at North Point Mall today and wanted to grab dinner afterwards. Food - 3 stars. I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti. Not good, the spaghetti was kind of hard. And the sauce was a too sweet. I've ordered this at other locations before and it was way better. It's probably a hit or miss here like another reviewer said, but this visit was definitely a miss for me. Service - 3.5 stars. Nothing extraordinary, but not bad. There were no offers to refill our drinks though. Maybe because we only had water. *shrug Ambiance - 4 stars. Nice and spacious. Welcoming lighting.

Krescent F.,"Alpharetta, GA",227,152,501,1.0,1/25/2017,"I think I'm done with this location! DONE!  This is actually the second time that I've had a bad experience, but this time I'm not letting it go without updating my review. Got here today around noon for lunch and was promptly seated.  That is where all the good things come to an end.  It took about 15 mins for our waiter to even acknowledge that we were there.  I watched him train someone on the ordering system while we waited during our lunch time.  Perhaps that could have waited until the lunch rush was over!!!!  We got some water and some bread, then we waited for our lunch special pizzas/salads to show up.  Well, it was 12:58pm and no food or waiter to be found.  Hmmmmmm, he then comes around the corner with food for the table behind us.  When I inquire about our food he says, that they were waiting longer than me and our food wasn't ready yet.  I told him that we didn't have time to wait he huffed and walked off.  We decided to leave, but I hung around to speak with the manager.  I explained to her about the wait and she even stated that our food wasn't ready.  The reason why was that they were busy and had a catering order. Hmmmmm, aren't restaurants usually busy for lunch near North Point? And, catering orders should not impede on in-house service.  She said that I could wait and she would pack up my food to go. NO THANKS! Sounds like they weren't prepared and we got screwed.  So, CPK....it looks like we're not friends anymore.  You let us down and the only remedy offered was for me to scarf down cold pizza at my desk. No THANKS.  Don't go here during lunch!!!!  Try times when you have hours to wait for your food or when they don't have catering orders or when there are less than 10 people in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta

I'm not too big on specialty pizzas bc whenever I try to venture out and order something different, it is not as good as my usual.  I love most of their salads and the margherita pizza.  My new favorite salad is the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad. My friend got me hooked on it.  Other good salads are the Thai Crunch Salad, Waldorf Chicken Salad, and Chinese Chicken Salad. I think I like the salads more than the pizzas!

Laura P.,"Atlanta, GA",11,16,,4.0,10/10/2006,"I think this place has really great selection. The only problem is that I keep ordering the same thing anyway! Every time I go, I get this ""personal"" size pizza (so named--i think-- because one person should never be seen in public eating this much) that has roasted pears, onions, and toasted hazelnuts and is topped with a bed of gorgonzola dressing-drenched arugula. Being so attached to this pizza is a predicament--the salad on top of the pizza makes it a little awkward to eat in front of people, but I can't take it home because it will be nasty and soggy, so I always have to finish it there. Alas and alack, but I obviously enjoy it anyway. Also, they do have a full bar and can whip you up a raspberry mojito, no questions asked. I personally, like to order the champagne split; it's festive and compliments the large quantities of cheese being served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=100
A + P.,"Holly Springs, GA",1,209,10,4.0,1/23/2010,"Dinner was tasty!  Field greens salad with gorgonzola was huge, even to share--the sweetened walnuts were the highlight for me.  My pizza was the shrimp scampi on the honey wheat crust, my wife had a thin crust margherita.  Both were great.  It came out to $43 before tip, which is maybe a little high compared to good deals we've gotten at other national chains lately (Mimi's, Chili's), but we brought enough home to have a meal tomorrow too, so I think it was still a pretty good value.  Service was nice, our food came out quickly, though our check didn't.  One other minor complaint was crumbs on my seat from the previous diners, but all things considered, that wasn't worth knocking CPK down a notch.  We enjoyed it and would go back to this one or any others, like our closest one on Ashford-Dunwoody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=100

When they brought out our pasta the rim of the pasta bowl was dirty with sauce from another customers dish so my wife got white Alfredo sauce on her black blouse. When her sauce was brown. So we know it came that way from the kitchen. She used her one paper napkin to clean her blouse so she asked for more napkins. It took three requests to get a replacement napkin. I don't ever remember a worst dinning experience at a CPK. In short, our waiter Preston needs more training and the manager's just did not care.

So when I saw the restaurant I was excited to try the pizza from the restaurant. However they didn't have it. They did offer to make a version of the pizza. Instead I ordered hummus as an appetizer and garlic fettuccine with shrimp and mushrooms. Food The hummus was amazing. Nothing else to say about it. The fettuccine was awful. The pasta was under cooked and they were very stingy with the shrimp. Service I asked the hostess how long it takes to prepare the pizza, she said I don't know(in such away). When leaving the restaurant I asked another hostess the name of my server. She said I don't know who? With that, my server Brad or Blake(young guy) was great, helpful and patient.  The bathroom was disgusting. Out of respect I will not go into detail. Dirty bathrooms makes me think the kitchen is dirty too.

The service was so prompt and friendly, my guest and I truly felt at home. There was a good selection of wine and house cocktails, and our drinks looked great and tasted better. The management staff was always present interacting with guests and teammates to make sure things were running smoothly and I appreciated seeing that they really cared about what was going on in the restaurant. Chris and Miguel absolutely slayed it in the kitchen and made the best pizzas my friend and I have had in a long time (I can't believe it was vegan and tasted that good), cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. It was very cool to get to watch them do their thing - since the restaurant features an open kitchen you get to check out all the behind the scenes stuff and really get a feel for everything that goes in to making your food come out perfect. Since the bar where we were sitting is right in front of the kitchen we got to chat with them throughout the process which was fun. I was very impressed with my visit and can't wait to return, thanks everyone for a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=20

Darren H.,"Atlanta, GA",95,1030,517,4.0,9/16/2009,"I waited until I was finished eating the pizza before I wrote the review, because as others have stated ""the service sucks""  I agree with that statement 100%. I figured i'm place my order on-line to avoid any hassles with the wait staff and take it back to the office to eat while I worked. With that plan what could go wrong?  Well they have curbside service which should make things a breeze. Pull up sign your credit card statement and you're on your way. Not in my case dear reader. I pull up and wait, and wait and wait some more. Finally I get out of the car and go in to pick up my pizza the waitress exclaims "" blue car?,  I was just about to go out and bring you your food""  Nothing about sorry for your wait or anything. Now mind you they gave me a window in which to pick up my food & I even gave them another 5 minute cushion to ensure it would be ready there when I went by there. All in all the service sucked as I stated earlier now to the main event. I got the BBQ chicken with blackwood smoked bacon. Even cold the pizza was yummy and the blackwood bacon is becoming a favorite of mine now having had it on two dishes this week.  Don't get my star rating confused, I know I did a lot of complaining at the start of this but the 4 stars are due to:  1. the food,  2. the website = being able to order stuff online and have it waiting for you is an awesome thing 3. the interior of the restaurant, very nicely decorated for a chain place.   Now if I ever get the nerve up to deal with the wait staff i'll update my review of a sit down experience. Oh and I almost forgot, what's up with the giant bags they give you for take out items?  I'm sure an entire tree didn't have to die just so I could bring some pizza back to the office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=80

Not bad for lunch. It aint Anitco but certainly  a respectable pie.   She had the Moroccan chicken salad which she usually orders at CPK.

Kenneth N.,"Sandy Springs, GA",56,119,3,1.0,8/30/2010,"The highlight of the meal was being seated and handed our menus by our server Daryl at 11:45 AM. It all went downhill from there and that is sad because I was looking forward to eating here because it had been a couple of years since I have eaten at a CPK. Our server finally showed up to take our order about 20 minutes after being seated. This was a bad way to start given how business people are constrained for time during lunch. I run out of water after 30 minutes. My glass sits empty, parched for the next 40 minutes. I think it's fair to say that not one employee of CPK had the consideration to stop by the top during the first HOUR AND TEN minutes it took for the food to arrive since being seated. (excluding the actual order taking). When I say our food arrived I mean it in the broadest sense. Because while everyone else got their food, my Waldorf salad was busy wilting away in some nether region of the kitchen. Did the kitchen staff notice? Did the server notice? Did the server stop by the following 15 minutes to check on everyone's meal? NO NO NO. At this point I didn't even want my salad, but my co-workers flailed their arms around and grabbed the server's attention and he ""promptly"" (ha ha) brought out my now deflated salad.  At this point we've reached the hour and a half mark in to the journey.  Should I even bother describing the salad? The apples,grapes, walnuts and Gorgonzola were fine, but of course the salad greens were limp and wilted after sitting in the balsamic vinaigrette.  By the time were were presented with the bill, the lunch (excluding travel time) took 1 hour and 45 minutes. And it's not like we were the only people with a slow table. Nearly, everyone around us at other tables when we started were there when we left. My Bill (thank good I only had water) for the salad was $16.40 (which included the automatic gratuity if 18%) Evidently TIPS stands for TO INSURE PATHETIC SERVICE. I'm NEVER going there again. They got my last nickel they will ever see from me.  Why didn't I see the manager? If I was not in a group environment and IF I had another half hour to waste. I would have.

Debra F.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,23,,1.0,10/8/2014,"The review is based on service, not the food. I've been eating at CPK since it opened in Atlanta and not once have eaten a bad meal. Tonight though for the second time thru their online ordering I ran into an issue with pickup. I've already complained once to the mgr about on time delivery and she was very kind and sent coupons for a couple meals about a year ago. The issue I have is that the problems are not corrected. I appreciate my free meal , but if nothing changes in the curbside pickup I will have to take my business elsewhere permanently. I went tonight to pick up my order that I placed 45 minutes earlier in the evening and set the time to pick up at 7:30. I get to the pick up curb and call in. They tell me it will be out when ready. Ok...it should be ready since I was right on time at 7:29 and the order was placed 45 minutes earlier. I sat for 10 minutes in my car and still no order. I got out of my car which is the entire reason for me to go to Curbside Pick up and enter the restaurant, headed straight to the pick up area where they were completing my order. I was very nice and the woman completing the order apologized saying the order was on the house ; however, after I got home I realized I had charged the order already when I placed the order online. So she must be laughing at me right now since I had already paid! Well I plan on disputing my charge on my credit card now because she told me it was free for my troubles. The point of this message is CPK I hope you read the reviews here because YOU ALL MUST FIX the problems at your pickup/curbside service and be on time. The restaurant was given 45 minutes to get its act together and then the other 10 minutes while I waited in my car which is absolutely inexcusable. I will try one more time and if it happens again then I'm done forever with CPK. Its obviously not well managed otherwise this would not keep occurring. Hire more people for that area ,hire people that are more organized. Whatever the issue it must be fixed.

Andrew W.,"Lawrenceville, GA",373,274,413,3.0,4/1/2014,"With all of the unique eateries that Metro-ATL has to offer, it's not often that we partake of national chain restaurants.  However, neither the wife or I had ever tried California Pizza Kitchen before so we decided to give them a shot (there weren't too many other restaurants near the North Point Mall that really drew our interest).   The service was pretty good - friendly, unobtrusive, yet present when needed.  The restaurant appeared to be kept clean.  The menu, though specializing in pizzas (with a unique flair) also was filled with flatbreads, salads, pastas, soups, sandwiches, tacos, various assorted appetizers, and other specialties - just about everything but the kitchen sink.  Usually, a menu this unfocused makes me nervous (restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, or TGI Fridays have adopted this same approach - and as a result have produced mediocre food at best).   Fortunately enough, CPK did slightly better than the aforementioned restaurants.  The Avocado Club Egg Rolls come highly recommended - truly, I would come back for these alone (In fact, we did).  The supplied ""ranchito sauce"" was awesome spooned over those egg rolls filled with bacon, avocado, chicken, and Monterey jack cheese.  So good!  The Bianco Flatbread was ok, but forgettable next to the Avocado Club Egg Rolls.  So was the Crispy Mac 'N Cheese (I could do far better making these at home).  Don't get me wrong, none of this was *bad*, just forgettable. The Habanero Carnitas pizza was ok.  It was a bit too laden with red onion and cilantro for my taste, and the habanero salsa (paired on the side) was far to liquidy and sloppy to properly enjoy on the pizza.  Nevertheless, the pizza crust was good and I admired the creativity. No doubt, there's something here for everyone (though the trick may be finding it).  It's a place with a few hits, but more misses.  One thing is for certain, many of the menu items are decidedly Californian - with Mexican and Asian influences and creative interpretations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=60

I had gone back to the location at Lenox, and saw some potential for something special.  So I decided one afternoon that my buddy and I would go eat at the NPM location for nostalgia purposes. Now before I go any further, I would just like to let you know that yes, I lived in suburbia for 21 years of my life and yes, I know a person or 2 in said territory- one of the reasons I DO NOT spend a lot of time in public in said territory (hold that thought).  I will save that sap for another time.   When we went, it was a late afternoon meal- so they were not many people there.  I could tell they had done some remodeling from the past visit(s).  We sat in a booth and we were surrounded by cougars (c'mon, I just wanted to eat.... PIZZA!)- go figure.  I also noticed the extensive menu overhaul, along with a decent alcohol selection (one of the few places I have seen that carry tall boys of Stella).  However, they still carry Pepsi (yuck!).  I stuck with Stella. They had some kind of pizza with a habanero salsa that I ordered and I tell you what- it was pretty tasty!  I just wished I got another one.  They still had bread, and it was alright (funny how a pizza place gives someone bread- starch overload!)- it was freshly baked to say the least. While we were enjoying our meal, my buddy (who I also worked with before I moved) told me to not turn around- as one of his supervisors (my old coworker) was sitting at the bar with someone else we worked with- oh shit, how are we going to avoid this reunion?  Don't worry, we didn't.  So we caught up, and got the hell out. I like what they did to the place and has some potential.  Believe it or not, they have some solid salads as well- if you don't want pizza.  But the fact we were surrounded by cougars in a pretty empty restaurant and the slightly slow service that day, I just couldn't push it to 4 stars.  But the food, they are working on something right there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=40

I'm not a huge pizza: mostly because I get sick of generic combinations and ingredients that taste unsavory and bland. I was really impressed with the menu and the flavor combinations really interesting. I have the California club pizza and it was so delicious I can't believe I finished the whole thing. The dining room was very clean and neat.  There was no stickiness, no food on the floor, and nothing was in disarray... It was refreshing to walk into a restaurant where they take pride in maintaining a clean and comfortable dining experience Just a couple of side notes for the staff:    We got our drinks very promptly but it was mostly filled to the top with ice-very little of the beverage was actually in there. I felt weird always asking for a refill but if you took the amount of ice out of the glass you would've noticed that the vessel only contained 30% of tea.    It's always distracting when there are loud and noisy children.  I wish that a lot of restaurants would get on board with segregating families from adult patrons. I know that's not realistic but it's upsetting when you can't have a conversation across the table with someone because of a screaming toddler 6 feet away.

Jesse D.,"Marietta, United States",2,6,2,1.0,25/2/2017,"Worst CPK experience ever. I personally love California Pizza Kitchen but this location consistently has the absolute worst service. We went today for lunch around 3pm (so not busy at all) and ordered drinks and two appetizers. Once our drinks arrived we ordered our food since we could tell it would take a while. 50 minutes later, we had not received anything, after asking for another drink and inquiring about our food. We talked to the manager and said she wouldn't address the issue with us so we left. Rude, slow staff.

Traci S.,"Willoughby, United States",0,25,9,2.0,12/3/2017,"First Time For years I have purchased CPK from the grocery store and I loved it. So when I saw the restaurant I was excited to try the pizza from the restaurant. However they didn't have it. They did offer to make a version of the pizza. Instead I ordered hummus as an appetizer and garlic fettuccine with shrimp and mushrooms. Food The hummus was amazing. Nothing else to say about it. The fettuccine was awful. The pasta was under cooked and they were very stingy with the shrimp. Service I asked the hostess how long it takes to prepare the pizza, she said I don't know(in such away). When leaving the restaurant I asked another hostess the name of my server. She said I don't know who? With that, my server Brad or Blake(young guy) was great, helpful and patient.  The bathroom was disgusting. Out of respect I will not go into detail. Dirty bathrooms makes me think the kitchen is dirty too.

The staff was super welcoming and big shout out to Hector at the bar who helped accommodate my vegan diet by talking with me about my specific needs and going out of his way to make sure I had some great options to choose from. The service was so prompt and friendly, my guest and I truly felt at home. There was a good selection of wine and house cocktails, and our drinks looked great and tasted better. The management staff was always present interacting with guests and teammates to make sure things were running smoothly and I appreciated seeing that they really cared about what was going on in the restaurant. Chris and Miguel absolutely slayed it in the kitchen and made the best pizzas my friend and I have had in a long time (I can't believe it was vegan and tasted that good), cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. It was very cool to get to watch them do their thing - since the restaurant features an open kitchen you get to check out all the behind the scenes stuff and really get a feel for everything that goes in to making your food come out perfect.

Cassandra R.,"Roswell, United States",0,4,21,5.0,16/6/2017,"I had been wanting to eat the food of California Pizza Kitchen for so long. The thought of tasting a gourmet pizza of this type that is not like fast food pizza whether Cici's Pizza or Papa John's or Little Caesar's.  In addition, I was a little excited to be around a more upscale atmosphere that I don't know, I just got the feeling the place exuded when I would pass it by. Was I right! I made my way there as a second option I was wanting to try out when Dave & Buster's loud and inattentive service failed to impress me.  Still good for me because I wanted so badly to try one of their gourmet pizzas and eat either some cheesecake or red velvet cake which I researched they served.  I'm a quiet person and like to keep to myself so preferably I want a restaurant that is quiet & low-key. Especially as I am simply there for the food. And I want to savor every morsel. Slowly too, just so that I can taste it fully. And as a matter of fact I can't understand people who go to restaurants with big parties since if you are socializing, how are you enjoying your food? I would never do it since if I'm going to restaurant it is for the food and nothing else. Not even to talk or chat with the waiters.  Anyway. I was tremendously glad when I arrived at around 8:45 PM give or take, that the atmosphere of the place was quiet and was pretty elegant looking. Even the outside with soft yellow lighting which contrasted wonderfully with the building. Right off: impressed. Next since I have never dined at a casual dining restaurant of the scale of California Pizza Kitchen I was a little worried to how I will approach someone about getting seated. It was not hard at all. I got seated (I mentioned yes I was dining by myself) and was told Breanna would be my server although I was assisted by her assistant, Kate.  And Kate was really nice and did a terrific job though she said she was still relatively new as a server. I thought she was very attentive and nice. Especially as she left me to my own devices to enjoy my food and would still come assist me when I needed to ask something.  But let's get on to it. What was my response to California Pizza Kitchen's food at Alpharetta GA North Point Dr? It was delicious and just as I imagined. First off the Strawberry Mango Cooler I ordered was so refreshing and sour. Perfect! I love sour flavors. Next, the red velvet cake was incredibly soft, creamy, and moist. Definitely tasted better than store-bought. Oh, and before I forget the red velvet cake can be served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream at no extra charge. Wow! That's amazing! Finally, the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza was very mushroomy. It was on the organic-tasting side even though I ended adding salt and black pepper to it since in my opinion it needed better seasoning. Don't get me wrong. It was good but it needed more zest. I'm a huge believer that seasonings and spices add more flavor to food.  In any case, I was truly impressed by the attentive service and delicious food including the pizza. I certainly recommend and, of course, I myself will be returning to the restaurant whenever my top favorite musician TK from Ling tosite sigure announces an upcoming music release. As a way to celebrate that he'll be releasing new music.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta

The pizza was just warm when I reached home which was just about 15 minutes drive forcing me to believe that the pizzas were ready much before the scheduled pick-up time of 6:00 PM. $ 13.99 for a warm-cold pizza with minimum toppings is not a great deal in my mind!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta

I ordered a bowl of Southwest tortilla soup. Soup was good but not very spicy for my taste. It was warm but I like my soup real hot. The 3 appys we ordered were: Buffalo Cauliflower, Avacado egg roll and roasted peppers. Enjoyed all three. However, cauliflower dish was the best superb and tasty.

Got here today around noon for lunch and was promptly seated.  That is where all the good things come to an end.  It took about 15 mins for our waiter to even acknowledge that we were there.  I watched him train someone on the ordering system while we waited during our lunch time.  Perhaps that could have waited until the lunch rush was over!!!!  We got some water and some bread, then we waited for our lunch special pizzas/salads to show up.  Well, it was 12:58pm and no food or waiter to be found.  Hmmmmmm, he then comes around the corner with food for the table behind us.  When I inquire about our food he says, that they were waiting longer than me and our food wasn't ready yet.  I told him that we didn't have time to wait he huffed and walked off.  We decided to leave, but I hung around to speak with the manager.  I explained to her about the wait and she even stated that our food wasn't ready.  The reason why was that they were busy and had a catering order. Hmmmmm, aren't restaurants usually busy for lunch near North Point? And, catering orders should not impede on in-house service.  She said that I could wait and she would pack up my food to go. NO THANKS!

Andrew W.,"Lawrenceville, United States",373,274,413,3.0,1/4/2014,"With all of the unique eateries that Metro-ATL has to offer, it's not often that we partake of national chain restaurants.  However, neither the wife or I had ever tried California Pizza Kitchen before so we decided to give them a shot (there weren't too many other restaurants near the North Point Mall that really drew our interest).   The service was pretty good - friendly, unobtrusive, yet present when needed.  The restaurant appeared to be kept clean.  The menu, though specializing in pizzas (with a unique flair) also was filled with flatbreads, salads, pastas, soups, sandwiches, tacos, various assorted appetizers, and other specialties - just about everything but the kitchen sink.  Usually, a menu this unfocused makes me nervous (restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, or TGI Fridays have adopted this same approach - and as a result have produced mediocre food at best).   Fortunately enough, CPK did slightly better than the aforementioned restaurants.  The Avocado Club Egg Rolls come highly recommended - truly, I would come back for these alone (In fact, we did).  The supplied ""ranchito sauce"" was awesome spooned over those egg rolls filled with bacon, avocado, chicken, and Monterey jack cheese.  So good!  The Bianco Flatbread was ok, but forgettable next to the Avocado Club Egg Rolls.  So was the Crispy Mac 'N Cheese (I could do far better making these at home).  Don't get me wrong, none of this was *bad*, just forgettable. The Habanero Carnitas pizza was ok.  It was a bit too laden with red onion and cilantro for my taste, and the habanero salsa (paired on the side) was far to liquidy and sloppy to properly enjoy on the pizza.  Nevertheless, the pizza crust was good and I admired the creativity. No doubt, there's something here for everyone (though the trick may be finding it).  It's a place with a few hits, but more misses.  One thing is for certain, many of the menu items are decidedly Californian - with Mexican and Asian influences and creative interpretations.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=60

Darren H.,"Atlanta, United States",95,1030,517,4.0,16/9/2009,"I waited until I was finished eating the pizza before I wrote the review, because as others have stated ""the service sucks""  I agree with that statement 100%. I figured i'm place my order on-line to avoid any hassles with the wait staff and take it back to the office to eat while I worked. With that plan what could go wrong?  Well they have curbside service which should make things a breeze. Pull up sign your credit card statement and you're on your way. Not in my case dear reader. I pull up and wait, and wait and wait some more. Finally I get out of the car and go in to pick up my pizza the waitress exclaims "" blue car?,  I was just about to go out and bring you your food""  Nothing about sorry for your wait or anything. Now mind you they gave me a window in which to pick up my food & I even gave them another 5 minute cushion to ensure it would be ready there when I went by there. All in all the service sucked as I stated earlier now to the main event. I got the BBQ chicken with blackwood smoked bacon. Even cold the pizza was yummy and the blackwood bacon is becoming a favorite of mine now having had it on two dishes this week.  Don't get my star rating confused, I know I did a lot of complaining at the start of this but the 4 stars are due to:  1. the food,  2. the website = being able to order stuff online and have it waiting for you is an awesome thing 3. the interior of the restaurant, very nicely decorated for a chain place.   Now if I ever get the nerve up to deal with the wait staff i'll update my review of a sit down experience. Oh and I almost forgot, what's up with the giant bags they give you for take out items?  I'm sure an entire tree didn't have to die just so I could bring some pizza back to the office.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=80

Not bad for lunch. It aint Anitco but certainly  a respectable pie.   She had the Moroccan chicken salad which she usually orders at CPK.

Kenneth N.,"Sandy Springs, United States",56,119,3,1.0,30/8/2010,"The highlight of the meal was being seated and handed our menus by our server Daryl at 11:45 AM. It all went downhill from there and that is sad because I was looking forward to eating here because it had been a couple of years since I have eaten at a CPK. Our server finally showed up to take our order about 20 minutes after being seated. This was a bad way to start given how business people are constrained for time during lunch. I run out of water after 30 minutes. My glass sits empty, parched for the next 40 minutes. I think it's fair to say that not one employee of CPK had the consideration to stop by the top during the first HOUR AND TEN minutes it took for the food to arrive since being seated. (excluding the actual order taking). When I say our food arrived I mean it in the broadest sense. Because while everyone else got their food, my Waldorf salad was busy wilting away in some nether region of the kitchen. Did the kitchen staff notice? Did the server notice? Did the server stop by the following 15 minutes to check on everyone's meal? NO NO NO. At this point I didn't even want my salad, but my co-workers flailed their arms around and grabbed the server's attention and he ""promptly"" (ha ha) brought out my now deflated salad.  At this point we've reached the hour and a half mark in to the journey.  Should I even bother describing the salad? The apples,grapes, walnuts and Gorgonzola were fine, but of course the salad greens were limp and wilted after sitting in the balsamic vinaigrette.  By the time were were presented with the bill, the lunch (excluding travel time) took 1 hour and 45 minutes. And it's not like we were the only people with a slow table. Nearly, everyone around us at other tables when we started were there when we left. My Bill (thank good I only had water) for the salad was $16.40 (which included the automatic gratuity if 18%) Evidently TIPS stands for TO INSURE PATHETIC SERVICE. I'm NEVER going there again. They got my last nickel they will ever see from me.  Why didn't I see the manager? If I was not in a group environment and IF I had another half hour to waste. I would have.

Debra F.,"Alpharetta, United States",0,23,,1.0,8/10/2014,"The review is based on service, not the food. I've been eating at CPK since it opened in Atlanta and not once have eaten a bad meal. Tonight though for the second time thru their online ordering I ran into an issue with pickup. I've already complained once to the mgr about on time delivery and she was very kind and sent coupons for a couple meals about a year ago. The issue I have is that the problems are not corrected. I appreciate my free meal , but if nothing changes in the curbside pickup I will have to take my business elsewhere permanently. I went tonight to pick up my order that I placed 45 minutes earlier in the evening and set the time to pick up at 7:30. I get to the pick up curb and call in. They tell me it will be out when ready. Ok...it should be ready since I was right on time at 7:29 and the order was placed 45 minutes earlier. I sat for 10 minutes in my car and still no order. I got out of my car which is the entire reason for me to go to Curbside Pick up and enter the restaurant, headed straight to the pick up area where they were completing my order. I was very nice and the woman completing the order apologized saying the order was on the house ; however, after I got home I realized I had charged the order already when I placed the order online. So she must be laughing at me right now since I had already paid! Well I plan on disputing my charge on my credit card now because she told me it was free for my troubles. The point of this message is CPK I hope you read the reviews here because YOU ALL MUST FIX the problems at your pickup/curbside service and be on time. The restaurant was given 45 minutes to get its act together and then the other 10 minutes while I waited in my car which is absolutely inexcusable. I will try one more time and if it happens again then I'm done forever with CPK. Its obviously not well managed otherwise this would not keep occurring. Hire more people for that area ,hire people that are more organized. Whatever the issue it must be fixed. I cannot be the only customer facing this issue.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-alpharetta?start=80

Being so attached to this pizza is a predicament--the salad on top of the pizza makes it a little awkward to eat in front of people, but I can't take it home because it will be nasty and soggy, so I always have to finish it there. Alas and alack, but I obviously enjoy it anyway. Also, they do have a full bar and can whip you up a raspberry mojito, no questions asked.
