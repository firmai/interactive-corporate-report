The food is hot, fresh and outstanding! Wait time?  There isn't a wait time on food, appetizer was out in 3 minutes,  food was out in 8 after we placed it. This is the Applebee's we have all grown up to know!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-athens-12,,,,,
3,Ellen C.,"El Paso, TX",142,552,814.0,2.0,2014-09-25,"Due to my chosen profession, Im only allowed adult beverages about 3 times a year. I told the bartender I was having 3 and wasn't driving, as I was staying next door. I finished one and sat with an empty glass. She made the next. It took perhaps 20 minutes to finish that.  I again sat with an empty glass. I tried calling them to find out how much they were so I could just pay and leave but after several attempts it seemed they had the phone off the hook.  Finally she returned and I was so frustrated I just left a 20 and didn't wait for my change. Looking back, I shouldn't have left a 40% tip. Next time I'll just go elsewhere and spring for a cab.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-athens-12,,,,,
4,Amanda H.,"Birmingham, AL",0,13,,3.0,2015-03-11,"Since I was dining solo, I sat at the bar instead of a table.  What a bad experience.  Bar patrons were loudly vulgar, drunk as piss, ordering more rounds of tequila, and it smelled terrible!  Had to wait 30 minutes for my check after I asked for it whilst the bartender tended to the vulgar stooges.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-athens-12,,,,,
1,Piper N.,"Nashville, TN",76,3,,2.0,2016-07-01,Why can't these chains do anything for vegetarians. How hard is it to have a healthy salad on the menu that is more than iceberg lettuce and a tomato !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-athens-12,,,,,
2,Richard R.,"Collierville, TN",0,1,,1.0,2016-11-02,We had two different Chicken Pasta dishes. Didn't eat much of either. Very bland. Very little chicken. Pasta was lukewarm. Bar service was slow!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-athens-12,,,,,
