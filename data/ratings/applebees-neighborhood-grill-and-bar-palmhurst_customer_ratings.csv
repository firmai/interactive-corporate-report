7,R N.,"Palmhurst, TX",0,5,,4.0,2016-01-29,"We had all but given up on this legacy chain until they opened this one.  I an attempt to update themselves, Applebees built this prototype.  The new look is sort of a rustic-industrial design.  It features a view through open grill and new bar layout.  The menu has been expanded but, still includes most of the original meals.  The quality and presentation of the food is definitely better than any other Applebees I have eaten at.  Hopefully, they don't let the improved quality go to the wayside as time goes on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
6,Morris R.,"Searcy, AR",19,96,18.0,4.0,2016-04-09,"This was our third visit to this Applebee's. It still has the ""new"" look. Clean and fresh. We were seated right away and the waitress tried to seat us in the open air area and we requested another seating then she took us to a booth directly in front of the open kitchen. Then we ask for another seating and she seated us in a nice booth by the window. We like the new menu's. Our food was properly prepared and was well presented on the plate. My wife requested onion rings instead of fries. The rings were dry and slightly over cooked. My peppercorn sirloin was cooked as ordered. The ability to pay at the table is a nice feature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,

2,Ronald B.,"Vancouver, WA",19,177,13.0,4.0,2017-11-21,We really like Applebee's. They have a decent menu and we can always find something interesting and tasty to eat.  The challenge now is we are eating a low carb diet....... We've done this before and have always found a work around at Applebee's. This time was no different. We both tried the Thai Shrimp Salad. It was VERY good. And it was quite large! I guessed that there wasn't enough protein in the salad so I ordered a grilled chicken breast on the side to share with the wife. We both finished our salads and loved them. Next time we will order the dressing on the side as it was over dressed. But other than that everything was great. Service was reasonable and courteous. We will return to this location and other Applebee's as they are consistently good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
1,H K.,"Ontario, CA",0,83,1.0,4.0,2017-12-07,We had chicken tortilla soup and french onion soup which were both very good. We had the appetizer sampler combo and split it.  There was a lot of food for us!  It was all great.  I wasn't big on the spinach artichoke dip but that was a personal preference.  Everything else was great!  The server was Paula and she was very nice.  She was helpful and attentive. The greeting hostess.....hmmm,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
4,Sandra S.,"Edinburg, TX",3,24,32.0,4.0,2017-12-29,This is the best Applebee's I have seen. The building is so modern and doesn't compare to the others. The food was good. I got the fiesta lime chicken and I really enjoyed it. Hubby got the burger which he says he didn't really like it due to the sauce it had but he didn't fully read what it came with. Our appetizer was the spinach and artichoke dip and it was ok. I paired my entree with a perfect patron margarita which was a recommendation on the menu. It was a good margarita and didn't taste so much like the mix. Overall good experience and we would recommend for others to come see and try the Applebee's on mile 3 but come during happy hour .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
0,Alejandro M.,"Mission, TX",675,61,223.0,4.0,2018-01-04,"This location to me is honestly one of the best in the valley. Very modern and clean, has a great vibe and look to it. The wood used in the decor including tables and booths and throughout the dining area look great.  The service was excellent, my waiter recommended me the coleslaw with my order of baby back ribs and it was a great choice! I just added a bit of pepper to it and that did the trick, left me wanting more. The fries were nice and hot my last visit, just how I like them. And what can I say about the ribs? They were just fantastic, meat falling off the bone very tender and the sauce was amazing as well. Will definitely be back for more. I tried a bit of their ""three cheese chicken cavitappi"" and it was very good as well, nice and creamy. It had some diced tomatoes and herbs on top that really allowed the dish to stand out. The portions are very generous. They have awesome beer specials too and great variety. Will definitely be back soon, highly recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
3,Bruce B.,"McAllen, TX",0,11,4.0,4.0,2018-01-09,This place has a nice interior and the atmosphere is pretty nice. I've had ribs and the steak here a few times and they are good. The last few times I ordered steamed broccoli it wasn't really steamed and it was hard and that's why I took one star away. The staff is friendly and helpful. Great place to eat and have a few drinks at.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-palmhurst,,,,,
