Rich ..,"Austin, TX",171,10,22,4.0,4/10/2016,"A great place to eat with variety of choices... (I held back the 5th star ... we had a party of 12 and they were reluctant to seat us until more showed up, making us feel uncomfortable about even asking ... we were done with waiting in the doorway)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",602,677,1990,4.0,11/15/2014,"BJ's is a chain I can count on when I'm hungry and need a place I know will be consistent and have something both my husband and I enjoy. I always get the thai chicken mango salad off their enlightened menu but decided to switch it up and try something new today.  I got the mediterranean chicken pita tacos and they were really good! So filling that I couldn't finish it. Two come on the plate with diced chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, feta, and a greek yogurt sauce that tasted exactly like sour cream. I thought they were fine without it. It's also served with 'bistro grains'. I couldn't tell if the grain was barley or farro but I did catch the red quinoa, corn, and black beans and thought they went well together. My husband surprised me by ordering off the enlightened menu too, but he got the bison burger that came with slaw and he cleaned his plate. We like to share something on the small bites menu as an appetizer sometimes and tried the fried artichokes today which I thought were just okay. The dipping sauce reminds me of a ranch but more tangy and the artichoke bites themselves could have used more seasoning.  I think the biggest advantage of dining here is their rewards program which gives you points for every dollar you spend that you can redeem later for free food. It costs nothing to get their card, you just have to remember to check in with it at the hostess stand each time you come. Download their app and that way you will always have your card number on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40
Cher E.,"Austin, TX",70,133,45,5.0,2/14/2017,"We've visited this BJ's location more than six times over the past two years and the food is always great. I'm writing this review today because I went into this location yesterday with one of my girlfriends who was visiting from out of town to celebrate my birthday. Our server, Kelby was so patient and awesome.  I was having trouble picking an entree and she asked me what I had taste for.  I told her, ""Something crunchy, fresh...and healthy.""  (I had indulged in junk food a little too much over the previous week, so I was craving something more healthy.)  She suggested the salmon pita tacos with the quinoa side salad.  I obliged and I am so glad I did!  That dish satiated my palate gloriously :)  As if that gesture wasn't yelp worthy on it's own, the manager, Desmond (whom I see there often and is always so cheerful and pleasant to the guests) came over, asked us what we were celebrating and I told him it was my birthday.  He offered to bring us two prosecco in champagne flutes with strawberries in them.  I hesitated initially because of my aforementioned indulgences of the week prior but he assured me that I would like it so we accepted.  All was well and I will of course be visiting this BJ's location again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40
Nat P.,"Austin, TX",70,115,35,4.0,5/27/2016,"On 1st  and 3rd Tuesdays of each month, I'll take my nephew out to dinner and I'll let him choose the restaurant.  I'll ask him, do you want ""Chinese, Japanese, Mexican,..."" and before I can finish, he will scream in Trump-ian fashion, ""No, I want White People.""  By that he means ""white people food,"" and by that he means ""BJs.""  Nothing defines WPF more than this restaurant.   Delicious boneless, spiceless, souless, flavorless, fresh from frozen, 3000-calorie delights are this chain's specialty.  My nephew's young taste buds love it and since my own tastes buds never evolved from my mother's TV dinners from the 60s, I love it too. I highly recommend the potato skins, which taste way better than the ones at Cheesecake Factory.  They are fully loaded and a true gut buster. My only complaint is the restaurant name has put me in an awkward position.  My nephew has occasionally asked me, what's BJs mean?  And since I don't like to lie,  I'll have to say , ""Son, it refers to something two or more adults do to show they love each other and that's all I can say until your 18. Now finish your fried turkey sandwich and fries.""  Then he stuffs his face and crisis is adverted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40

Justin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,43,,3.0,12/22/2015,"Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend. Servers were great and on top of things: so no issues there.  I ordered a mini pizza and expected it to be a larger quantity for its price. However, I was mistaken. I paid about $10 for a mini pizza and didn't feel that I got the value for its price. I'd recommend getting a burger if you want to spend an average restaurant budget ($10-15). It's way more worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40
Eric D.,"San Francisco, CA",193,78,35,1.0,11/15/2016,"I'm not even sure where to begin... Let's go with the easy part first. The food, it is what it is and that's all I can really say. It was decent and not as flavorful as you would think a place this size should be. I had the chicken Alfredo with chicken... 5 1/2 small slices of chicken that is. The Brockley that was in it was way overcooked and mushy. The service... This girl has got to go. Amy D She made me feel like I was in a diner. She walked up asking, drink? I asked her about a particular beer and she didn't seem to have a clue as to what I was talking about. As I sat there, I would look up and see her wiping The sweat from her forehead, wipe it off on her apron, then walk around refilling peoples water and taking picking their glasses up with the same hand she wiped her for head with.  When it came time for the check she had passed me several times, never checked on me to ask me how my meal was, never refilled my water glass, (thank God). A manager finally walked by and asked me how everything was and of course I mentioned I need my check and a box for my food. The manager delivered my check and brought me a box. I put my debit card in the check presenter, she ran my debit card, brought me back the check and didn't say a word. She then turned to the table next to me and told the family of four ""I hope you have a great night, it was my pleasure and I hope to see you again soon"".  Made me feel like I wasn't even there. The good news is, I don't ever have to go back since apparently a party of one is an inconvenience to her night. My total time there was 25 minutes, less than anyone else that was around me. And whoever is reading this, please do not respond and don't offer me a gift card to get me back in your doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40

Kim H.,"Round Rock, TX",6,4,8,3.0,9/8/2016,This is not a lunch place specially coming from work. The service is so slow that you need an hour and a lunch even if you show up at 11.30. There are a lot of businesses around this restaurant so they are serving lunch to a crowd and I get that but they seem ill prepared to do proper lunch service. On the other hand I've not really had any complaints about the food here.

Amy D.,"Austin, TX",835,1051,4364,3.0,4/27/2014,"Ohhh a chain! As a Yelper I am not supposed to like this place right?! Well if you are seeking a decent happy hour, a variety of draft beers and a health conscious menu don't be so quick to judge. I am a fan of their La Crema Pinot Noir, during happy hour it is $6 (otherwise $11.95). And when I am craving some carbs the happy hour (smaller portion) flat bread is just over 400 calories. The ""enlightened"" menu showcases 750 calories and under cuisine. Will the dishes knock you off your feet? Probably not but your tummy will be filled without hitting your pocket book too hard.

Josue M.,"Austin, TX",48,72,56,4.0,4/15/2016,"I know most folks cringe at the idea of dinning at a chain. It wasn't until my second visit that my brother broke the news to me. By then it was too late. I was already reeled in.  By now, I've had multiple visits and a few happy hours with co-works and I can't find much wrong with this place.  Regardless of your dietary preference, you'll for sure find something to satisfy your taste buds. They have a huge menu, so you won't find an issue in that department...trust me. I personally keep going back to the appetizer and small snack section. I'm hooked on their avacado egg rolls, ahi poke, spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the fried artichokes.  You'll also find a full bar with their in-house crafted beers. Well...not quite in-house. They have 6 BJ breweries in the US that brews for their locations. I was a little bummed when I found out that St. Arnold's Brewery in Houston would brew their beers. It wasn't until I spoke to one of their brewers at Denver's Great American Beer Festival that I found out why. Long story short: Texas houses more BJ's Restaurants then any other state (35), so they obviously need additional help from a super awesome brewery. Next time you walk in,  I highly recommend the Nutty Brunette and Jeremiah Red. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40
Kris U.,"Austin, TX",509,903,859,3.0,7/6/2014,"The menu here is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory, with an overwhelming array of options in all categories: burgers, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas and other American favorites.  The main difference of course is that BJ's has a larger selection of beer (their own) and Cheesecake Factory wins in the dessert category. That being said, I've never really found my ""go to"" dish at BJ's, until recently.  The Thai Chicken Avocado Mango salad was as delicious as it looked on the plate: a very pretty affair with mango slivers, red bell pepper, jicama, greens and sliced chicken, topped with a generous portion of avocado slices and dusted with chili powder and sprinkled with pine nuts. Their beer is okay, with something for everyone on their standard list.  Of these my favorites are the Piranha Pale Ale and the Nutty Brewnette, but your best bet is to go with one of their rotating seasonal or reserve beers for something more interesting and complex.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=40

Finally decided to give it a shot after hearing positive things. Overall I must say it was a positive experience and I'd be willing to come back again.  Everything we ordered was good but the only thing I noticed that could have been better was the food temperature. Although the Tuscan Tomato Bisque and Clam Chowder soups were warm at best, they were both good. The tomato and fresh mozzarella salad was exceptional, but it was real small. The half-sandwich with fries (the other part of our ""lunch combos"") were good and for $7.99 there are no real complaints here.  Some friends told us that their Jambalaya is really good.

I have never had bad food here, beer is always decent to great, but will admit that the servers can be spotty. But overall, i have great meals and drinks at this venue. Since its opened i go there at least 2 or 3 times a year(live in bastrop, hard to get to austin and way too many venues to eat at lol)  But i have had the loaded baked potato which was awesome, my friend had the salmon which he loved on my last visit. I was able to introduce my buddy to great beers as well and watch the Rangers game so he wouldnt miss it.  In the past ive also had other dishes that were really good, never bad. They used to have a decent chicken parm, which i was suprised at since there are some so called italian restaurants in austin that cant get even spaghetti right. (but of course there are others that are amazing!)  So the only thing that is hit or miss for us anytime i go can be the servers. This visit it was a particular bartender that wouldnt talk directly to us while she was doing something below the bar so we couldnt hear her repsonses or questions clearly.

Joe C.,"Austin, TX",468,339,1252,3.0,10/23/2012,"I did it all for the Pizookie. The gluten-free Pizookie! If you're going to review a place with a dated joke for a name, you may as well channel Limp Bizkit... *shrug* This is an easy 3* review.  I don't mean it bad.  Some things they do well, some not so much. Beer:  Sure... 4+ stars.  Plenty of selection.  The house-brand seasonal is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had.  I guess I'm just easy, because I don't care if they make it in house any more than I care that the cheesecake place down the road isn't located inside an actual factory.  Menu:  3*.  Typical large disjointed menu.  The gluten free menu looks like a brochure for a timeshare, and half of it is salads.  Yeah, I get it.  Leave out croutons, and your salads are gluten free.  Execution of Menu:  2*.  The patty melt was OK, not great.  The calamari I had at lunch seemed like it sat in the window a little bit.  At another location, the calamari was great.  Service:  we liked.  The work-lunch speed is good.  Our waitress at dinner was helpful and responsive.   But.... The gluten-free crust pizza is the real deal.  Wife declares it the ""second best gf pizza in Austin"".  The meatball topping is NOT gf, but unlike some places, the pepperoni *is* gf.  And since her fave pizza is 20-odd minutes away (plus time to find parking on E. 6th) having a place in the 'hood to satisfy her pizza cravings is great.   And...

When BJ's Restaraunt first opened, we would dine at BJ's a couple times a month.  We would order ALWAYS order their DEEP DISH PIZZA (BBQ Chicken) and it was divine, some of the best deep dish I've ever had.  Super thick crust, like two inches high, served in a metal pan, like it's supposed to be made.  Always filled us up.  Service was  solid and prices were higher than average but I gladly paid it since the food was good. But we moved house and it had been about nine months since we dined there.  But we recently got a hunkering for their DEEP DISH PIZZA and we returned ... and that's when the horror happened.  We ordered the deep dish pizza ... and it wasn't deep dish pizza.  Instead, it was served on a regular white plate and it was just regular pizza, like Papa John's, maybe a half inch thick.  We were like totally confused, man.  We asked our waiter like, uh, this isn't DEEP DISH PIZZA.  There is no deep crust.  No pan.  The pizza is relatively average in thickness.  And the waiter was like oh, yeah, we changed our recipe awhile ago and this is now the DEEP DISH PIZZA.  Oh, man, the horrors!  What a bad decision.  We still ate it, had no choice.  But we were still hungry afterwards ... a $15 dollar pizza, to boot. Also, our meal for our toddler, the veggies come out half cooked.  Had to resend them back, ugh.  Total disaster.

Jason R.,"Cedar Park, TX",62,17,10,3.0,10/20/2013,"I'll start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of this chain. It's just the right amount of impersonal service to rub you the wrong way. The actual hamburger meat here was decently seasoned and had good flavor, especially when put against the other pricey burgers I've had up to this point. The lettuce was lame iceberg considering the price and stood out like a sore thumb, but at least it and other condiments tasted fresh. Similar to the burger, the fries weren't great, but also weren't that bad either. Overall this burger/fry combo was decent, but not excellent. If you were forced to go to BJ's and are in the mood for a burger you could do much worse. With that said, in Austin, you can do much better for much cheaper.

But it was okay because I still had quite a bit. Then the Caesar salad came and it had barely any dressing. I did not have any utensils so I asked for some along with extra dressing. I never got my dressing so just ate basically lettuce and cheese shreds. At the end still no one had refilled my water so I asked the waiter for a refill one last time. I still never got the refill. In conclusion, no utensils, no apology for spilled drink, no refills, no dressing, and we were neglected most of the meal.

I frequent BJs when I'm in the mood for good, reasonably priced food, and a lot of it. I love their P.M. Porter. It's nitro conditioned which I've never seen in a porter, and tastes more like a stout to me (though I'm no expert).

Other HH specials include $2 off apps, and $1 off beer and well drinks, and HH is 3-7 M-F.

Danielle Z.,"Austin, TX",50,81,15,4.0,7/6/2011,"I've been to the south BJ's location before (and one in Colorado) but I really enjoy this north one more for some reason.  My girlfriends and I went on a random Thursday around 6:45pm. The restaurant was surprisingly full, all the bar tables were full, and there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated which wasn't bad at all. We were promptly taken to our table which wasn't a booth but didn't feel like we were exposed like it sometimes feels when you're in the middle of a dining room. Our server was a little soft spoken but, in my opinion, hit all her marks in offering drinks, apps, etc. The girls and I were in the ""trying"" mood so we opted for quite a few things! Oh and we were there in time for happy hour which were a few bucks off beers and cocktails but none of that struck our fancy that time. First, we got a sample of the Berry Cider (hard cider!) and decided to get a pitcher of that. It was very delicious and tasted like berry champagne actually! Then we shared the appetizer sampler of mozzerella sticks (standard), spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips (actually very very tasty), avocado egg rolls (not bad), and the santa fe egg rolls (yummy).  The menu is very extensive but all looked great! I would find it hard to believe if someone didn't find something they liked here. So, our app plates were all cleared away and it actually took a little while for our entrees to come out but it wasn't too long that anyone said anything- but I know the girls were all thinking it too. I got the fish and chips which were tasty but were a little over fried (they were fried past the golden color and were a little more brown). I opted to try both fries- the thin and the wedge and both were good. The wedge fries reminded me of the fries from KFC. My friend got the parmesean crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes and she really enjoyed it and said they were some of the best potatoes she'd ever had. My other friends split the Mediterranean pizza and said they loved it as well.  After our food was boxed up by the server tableside (nice touch), we ordered dessert. We split the oven baked beignet topped with strawberries, whipped cream, and a side of vanilla ice ceam. We also shared the red velvet cookie thingie (the actual name escapes me) which was also topped with ice cream.  By the end, needless to say, we were stuffed, satisfied, and probably had a pretty happy server since she probably wasn't expecting 4 girls to give her the ideal ordering experience from top to bottom!  All in all, I liked the food, the atmosphere is high energy, and there were all sorts of peole- couples, groups of friends, families, business associates, etc. I'll definitely keep BJ's on my list of places to take all of the above mentioned parties when in a bind!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=160

Nathan I.,"Austin, TX",1997,455,3219,4.0,8/1/2011,"When Dillard's has an extra 40% off sale, you can bet I set aside the day to expertly comb over the Ralph Lauren merchandise to find all the best deals. I've never served in the armed forces, but this task is completed with military precision. However, before I could make it out to Lakeline to complete the Austin Dillard's Trifecta, I had to refuel in a big way. I figured now was as good a time as any to try the deep dish pizza that N and K had said that BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was known for.  I never guessed they had a revolving door out front, since I never really grasped the size of the place when viewed off MoPac. The place is enormous; a slicker, pumped-up version of other chain restaurants with the added allure of doubling as a microbrewery. And while not as easily parlayed into cheap puns as 'Evil Wiener"", don't think for a second the name ""BJ's"" didn't have me giggling a bit. I may have used one on Facebook when someone commented on my check-in, though (Gary: I LOVE BJ's! Me: Who doesn't?).  My God, was it busy. This was a Thursday. You'd think the damned Super Bowl was on the way everyone was packed in like sardines around the bar. A bar, according to K, that uses hundreds of bottles of top-shelf liquor simply for show. Expensive items just for show? That's so up my alley. My little electronic beeper even had a note that said you could call ahead to put your name down as you leave the house. I guess that was for the days when EVERYONE in Austin decided to show up for chow, and not just half of the city like I witnessed.   The hostess said there'd be a 5-10 minute wait, which I found suspicious when she told the same thing to three other people who came in after me and absolutely no one was leaving the restaurant. I sat down on the only free edge of a bench to ride it out, even though a charming couple was taking up the enter thing. The man made a token movement down to give me more room, but the chick decided to remain splayed out. Keeping it classy, I see.  Once I was seated, the din of noise and constant movement didn't stop. Raucous groups of people were knocking back micro brews; a Paris Hilton look-alike and her super hot boyfriend were chatting; and three moms and about a dozen kids rounded out the table next to me. Apparently, BJ's attracts a lot of different people.  I began with a Tatonka® Stout -- ""A classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars....Beer doesn't get much more intense than this!"" It's delicious and tastes like Guinness. It also makes you feel you've just drank a loaf of bread.  It was an extensive menu, with token light fare. I started with the small bite version of the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. On top of a nice presentation, the appetizer was surprisingly flavorful, with basil, red onion, Parmesan cheese, and a balsamic glaze that mixed beautifully. It's a nice, light appetizer to hold you over before a heavier entree. An entree such as BJ's Classic Combo deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza is brought out and placed on a raised platform. It was cooked perfectly--not too crispy, and not too doughy. No one ingredient overpowered the other, and the cheese and sauce ratio was spot on. They were a little light on the mushrooms, but the Italian sausage was actually quite flavorful, and not just greasy little fat pellets like they can be. The waitress suggested a size ""small"" for one hungry person, and the portion was correct. A medium could be split, and I'm not sure how many people are meant to chow down on a large.  Thanks to their flashy slideshows by the bar, I was made privy to the existence of something called a Triple Chocolate Pizookie®: An obscene chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. Oh--it's chocolate, FYI, in case you missed that. I only ordered it because I love Ghiradelli, having visited the factory during a trip to San Francisco.  The waitress thankfully informed me that this dessert came in a mini size. Thank God, because what was described above would have sent me into sugar shock before the bill arrived. It may have skirted the line of decadence and tackiness just a bit, but you know it was awesome.  Our waitress was polite and seemed remarkably composed during what I can only imagine was a veritable sh*tstorm of activity. She and a couple other waitresses who brought me my food were all blonde, attractive, and somewhat interchangeable. No one missed a beat, though, and the service was punctual during the entire meal. I know that it's a chain, and it's a little loud and cramped, but BJ's pleasantly surprised me. I'd suggest it to fans of beer, pizza, and those who don't mind crowds.  At the end I was glad there was a revolving door. After THAT meal, you could have practically rolled me out. 4 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=140

Paul R.,"Cedar Park, TX",76,548,60,3.0,5/16/2012,"My business guest spied the BJs restaurant as were speeding up Mopac to his hotel. He proclaimed that he loved this restaurant when he lived in Houston and that we needed to go there for dinner. Really, a chain restaurant noooo. But being open minded, I've never been there, and seeing that it was his treat I acquiesced. We arrived right behind a family with a couple of small children and I leaped to the conclusion that we would be seated right near them. Wrong, the hostess sat us in a booth by the bar and the ginormous TVs, cool. While looking over the menu and the interior I realized that BJs reminds me of the old 99 restaurants I used to frequent when I lived in Boston. A family friendly pub - restaurant with good but not great food.  Well the service was very good, our drinks were always full and our appetizers and entrees were served promptly.  My appetizer a house salad was pretty weak but passable. My dining companion ordered the tomato soup and he said it was great. We both ordered steaks and they were OK not great but fine. My medium rare steak was really medium to medium well but it was seasoned very nicely. My companion had a couple of their beers and he said they were good.

Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,2.0,6/2/2011,"My hubby and I have been to BJ's down south numerous times and enjoyed it.  I decided to meet one of my friends at the new location for lunch.  It took almost 90 minutes for us to grab our ""quick"" lunch. Here is what happened.  I ordered the cobb salad and clam chowder soup.  He ordered the house salad with a spinach pizza.  When his pizza came, it was an artichoke pizza.  They had to bake him another pizza, which took forever.  I was eating my lackluster cobb (maybe my least favorite cobb ever) and feeling bad that he was without anything for so long. What really annoys me is that it was the waiter who rang in the order wrong and the manager knew about all of this and did not even comp my buddy's meal.  What is up with that?  Our waiter was super nice and we both did not want to complain, but afterwards we were annoyed.  This was going to be our go to lunch spot, but now I am not sure. It would have been nice customer service to have offered him another house salad while he waited, or an appetizer... Or comp the meal.  I feel like BJs handled this situation poorly. The hubby and I have never had any issues down south.  Maybe they are still getting things worked out at the new location.  Oh, and my salad came with the croutons I asked to not have.  This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope management sorts these issues out.  A weekday lunch should not literally take 90 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=140

The hostesses were very friendly and more than accommodating when our party unexpectedly increased in numbers.  It was a good start.  Our server was kickass.  He took orders efficiently, didn't mess anything up, and he was friendly to boot.  The kitchen had a few stumbles and food took longer than expected but the Manager stopped by and comped us a few items (as well as a few birthday desserts!).   We had appetizers and beer only during our visit, but I must say the apps are quite good.  The beer was sort of 'ho hum', but it certainly wasn't bad.  I would recommend the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Piranha Ale Nachos.   The desserts were also yummy. I especially loved the Baked Beignet. It was warm and tasty with ice cream on top. I want some more of it right now.   So yeah, it's a big EVIL national chain... but if you ignore that stuff, it's a decent spot to grab some apps.    Pros: Very Nice Staff, Accommodating to our Large Party,  Apps Were Good, Service was Solid Cons: It's Huge and Loud, The Beer is Just ""Okay""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=140

My family and I arrived and were seated promptly with no problems, as it was not very full. There were 5 servers at the door. However, after waiting 13 minutes, I put a 2 minute timer on, because I wasn't going to wait longer than 15 minutes. With the countdown on, we finally got a server. He didn't wait on us because of the timer, he saw from across the restaurant that we hadn't been served. He came over took our orders and we received our drinks as fast as he could. After he walked away, the manager came over and offered his apologies. We were calm, and the rest of our meal and service was actually quite enjoyable. We offered a thank you for his service to Nathan...our server...and out of his own mouth, he said he just didn't want anyone to leave displeased with their experience. So BJ's, this is a good employee to keep. He was fast, pleasant, and made the children's dining experience a good one. The food was good and no issues except the afore mentioned mishap.

The food isn't bad here.  (It's not good, either, though.  Very middle-of-the-road.)  What's been declining on each visit is the service.  The last visit, I was exasperated.  While our server was pleasant in the beginning, it became clear that she was in a rush to leave, or possibly go gossip with her co-workers.  My 2 friends and I were buying drinks during our meal, (and had planned on continuing to do so after the meal, as well.)  Unfortunately, our server made it very clear that we were over-staying our welcome.  (We weren't loud, the restaurant wasn't busy, and our server had 2 other tables, so it wasn't like we were holding her up from leaving.) Sadly, we were tired of her ""checking in on us"" and suggesting to-go boxes and stopping by to ""see if we needed anything else"" every few minutes, so we left.  She missed out on the opportunity to make a larger tip that evening, because I know each of us would have likely ordered at least 2 more cocktails a piece.  I think we're officially done with this place.

M. O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,296,4.0,11/9/2016,"My buddy and I are big fans of BJ's.   Restaurants!  Keep you head out of the gutter! Each time we visit the Austin area, we head over to the closest location to make sure we do at least one round of BJ's before heading home.   The chain is in the same vein as Granite City, where you have a nice, slightly upscale bar-and-grill approach to the dining room. The food is uber-solid for the genre, and the beer here is super easy to drink across the entire line.  No matter your preference, you'll find a very approachable brew with your name on it.   This time around, I went for the whiskey barrel aged porter, and was not disappointed.  Is it A+ beer?  Negative.  However, it's a solid, passable B all day long, and that's pretty good for a chain bar and grill. I've tried a good swath of the food on the menu as well.  Among my favorites is the pizza. But, the thing that will keep you coming back is the Pizookie.  Goofy in name but dead-serious in flavor, this has to be one of my favorite desserts, anywhere.  It's a fresh-baked cookie, served oven-warm in a micro-dish with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of sauce on top. There are multiple flavors to choose from, and all are killer.   On my last visit, our waitress, Ms. Marlie, enticed me with a bit of a tease about a Pizookie Platter, which she mentioned is like having five full-size Pizookies.  It's now on the bucket list. Over three trips to Austin, I've been to one BJ's or another six times.  Frequency alone ought to speak volumes, especially in a land of incredible food trucks and barbecue.

She replies, ""Yes, but we need to set it up, so we need you to go back to the hostess stand and wait""  OMG--nothing to set up but napkins--but, I should have know better, as they werent going to sit us there--so, they take us back to the hostess stand, another few minutes go by, and they take us to ANOTHER booth directly to the right side of the other cr@ppy table that was in the back that we didnt want --Seriously?  This is probably why I dont like chain restaurants nearly as much as when I was younger--Im not even going to review anything else, because seriously, if it is this much of an issue to sit at a nice table when a place is half empty, I won't be going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=20

Alcoholic drinks are pretty average. I'm confident enough in my own cocktail abilities to not order them though, but they are pretty good. There's a full bar and a lot of options so you can't really go wrong! I'm usually drawn to ordering the fish & chips - the wedge fries are to die for, and I like the tartar sauce a lot. Their burgers are also good, and their salads are pretty standard. There is also a pretty good range of pizzas and pastas, fish, and healthier dishes as well. I think everything on the menu is decent - nothing amazing but you can't really go wrong. Price is a little high for what you get in my opinion, but there are generally large portions. Service is generally very friendly but it is hit or miss - one worker once told me I had beautiful eyes and it really made my day. Another server once forgot my appetizer order, which was definitely annoying. I let it go because I wasn't charged but just something to note.

Today I tried the cherry chipotle glazed salmon.  Holy crap was it good.  I substituted veggies for the cous cous.  It comes with asparagus, which I love.  But the asparagus was really dry.  That's a crime.  The veggies were a bit undercooked, but still ok.   What I liked about this lunch was that they have a secret list (if you ask for it) that shows the calorie, fat, sat fat, sodium, carbs, fiber & protein content of all their menu items.  I was considering the lemon thyme chicken, but omg way way way too much sodium. That's a shame. I've eaten here on several occasions and their veggies are usually pretty good.  Today was an off day.  When I'm not behaving, their pizookies are sooooo good.  But I'm still mad that they discontinued the red velvet pizookie.  It was divine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=20

But this is the second time that BJ's has taken away my favorite dish with no notice! But I know I can't expect a chain food place to keep something that they don't want to, so I digress.  Once I realized that I would have to order something else I decided to try my boyfriend's favorite dish, the fish tacos. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the tortillas that the tacos were served in were disgustingly stale. I took one bite out of them and my teeth hurt stale. I would have told my server this and requested fresh ones or something else, but no one ever check on us after dropping off the food. Granted, our server had a large table that was nearby, but we never even received an ""Everything tasting ok?"" walk by. A manager even came by and talked with the large table near us, but never stopped to talk with us.

Danielle W.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2015,"Have you ever had a burger that was so good, you called your mom and apologized because the next time you see her, you will have to slap her?  That did not happen at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  I went for lunch with a coworker and it was a celebration for a promotion for me so I was super excited.  I had eaten at the location south before and so I knew what to expect in regards to the menu and service. Well, you don't know what you have until it's gone.   We sit down and wait for about ten minutes to even be greeted by our server.  She did not provide a name.  We were next to a very large table of people, maybe fifteen or twenty in total, but they were not rowdy or noisy at all. They had just finished placing their order when we sat down.  After waiting for a long time, we finally get a server and are able to order our drinks. Five minutes later, we actually get our drinks. We ordered lemonade so you wouldn't think it would take that long but that is neither here nor there.  When she comes back to our table with the drinks, we place our orders. We both order burgers, her's medium and mine mid-rare (I like my meat to fight me when I eat it).  Then we wait. And wait. And wait. The large table gets all their food, they get drink refills, they get asked if everything is alright, they are happy.  We are left waiting like Leo DiCaprio waiting for his Oscar. Finally, food arrives. HAHA NOPE. Not our food, the runner got the wrong table and then asked us if we are sure that that food isn't ours. Yes, we know that we ordered two burgers, not three sandwiches.  After 50 minutes and no sign of the waitress or really anyone, the large table is paying, getting to-go drinks and boxes, and is leaving. We FINALLY get our food. The fries are hot and tasty. Her burger is fine. Mine is like a hockey puck of overcooked sadness. I also asked for ranch for my french fries and I am only assuming that the woman had to go to the elusive Hidden Valleys themselves as she was never seen or heard from again and I never got my ranch. I take a bite of my burger as I am starting to eye my arm with a ravenous gaze at this point but no, I can't eat it. I just can't. Waitress is gone. She finally walks by, attempting to avoid eye contact but I manage to get her attention. We place an order to go for my other coworkers who stayed behind, two burgers with fries. She then realizes that we have no drinks left, we had even drunk the ice that had melted into water. Brings back two drinks and then scurries away.  Never once asked if everything was ok and never gave me a chance to say ""hey, I can't eat this.""  Just runs like Forrest Gump.  After eight minutes, she brings out the to go order. So they CAN cook burgers faster than an hour, they just choose not to. Gives me the check and then FINALLY notices that my burger is sitting there in it's entirety, gently congealing. ""Do you want a to-go box?"" I can't help it, I laugh. Tell her no, I can't eat this now, I won't eat it later. ""Was there something wrong with it?"" Told her that I had ordered mid-rare and this is quite obviously well done, then prove it by picking up the burger and tapping it against the plate, making the clinking sound of WAY overcooked meat.  ""Oh"" and walks away. Never apologized, never asked if I wanted something else. Nothing. No response other than ""oh"". She returns with the check and said that they took the burger off the bill and then walks away again.   I am a grown up. I understand that sometimes, things happen. Sometimes, burgers overcook and nobody notices. Sometimes, its busy and you can't get refills for a table. Sometimes, Mercury is in retrograde and a ninja just killed your pa and you have to work four jobs to support your grieving mother and you get to those jobs walking barefoot, in the snow, uphill both ways.  Ignoring a table and not following up on them is unacceptable. Maybe management needs a more hands on approach. Maybe this entire restaurant needs a sternly worded Come to Jesus talk. Maybe someone will ACTUALLY APOLOGIZE when they are told the food is inedible. I know that I will never eat here or at any BJ's again and I will try my hardest to never even drive by this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=120

Veek suggested BJs, and after a short moment of considering the possibilities of what she meant, I agreed that the brew house would be fine.  I wanted to try it, I had only been to a BJs one other time and it was fine, if not remarkable. We're trying to eat a bit healthier and one tactic is portion control, so a lot of times we split items   We both ordered a bowl of soup (pro tip - their ""small' soup is well over a cup and plenty unless its your main meal), but we split a burger.   Lest you start worrying about our sanity, we did also split a pitcher of their house made hefeweizen.  Calm down, we're old but not senile. The forced patter of the wait staff is somewhat off-putting:  ""Would like you try one of our appetizers such as XYZ"" and ""Would you like something to drink, perhaps one of our signature cocktails such as the ABC"".....  but our server was prompt, friendly and efficient.  Really, hard to fault her for the ridiculous policies of the restaurant.  It sounds for all the world like they took it right out of ""Office Space"".

Also, we wanted the dessert cookie with ice cream (forgot what they call it) but of course we can't agree on a cookie or the ice cream.  They can customize it, do 1/2 batter of one and 1/2 batter of your other choice and whatever two ice cream flavors you want!  It was really good and hit the spot.

Roberto E.,"Austin, TX",38,23,11,1.0,3/13/2014,"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in... The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him.  The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home. Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food.  I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food.  Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross. Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian. Whatever--this place just didn't do it for me.

However, me and my bf went back for the same pasta and it looked different, tasted different and was just not the same. It was so watery, it did not taste like pasta at all. It was salty and the two breadsticks that come with it werent there and our waiter seemed to notice but didnt care until we asked him to give it to us. The waitstaff there is always so unwelcoming and shows that they do not want to be there, like they have to be there or something. I know cuz im a waitress myself, but man you guys are corporate and need to be professional.

Travis X.,"Austin, TX",208,142,1,4.0,12/3/2012,"Atmosphere/Decor:  It has a sports bar type vibe to  it.  Tv's along the  wall playing sports, a large alcohol selection, dark interior etc. etc.  Service: Service here has always been good for us. We've come about 5 times at this point and haven't had a negative experience.  They stay on top of refills pretty quickly, usually partake in minor chit chat and get the food out in a timely manner.  Food/menu: I've had 4 or 5 different things at this point and all of them have been good.  I particularly like the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, just make sure to ask for extra sauce, they never seem to give you enough...or maybe I'm just fat :P I can't comment much on their beer/alcohol menu as I generally do not drink at restaurants because it costs an arm and a leg and I'm cheap! The food menu is varied with a good amount of things to offer.  I would say the menu is large but not TOO large.  I wish the selection of the ""personal size"" appetizers was a bit more appealing though.  Price: The price isn't bad for what you get. You get a large plate of  food no matter what you order. The price of the personal size appetizers are great so if you want to nibble on something before your meal, it will no longer cost you the same price as an entree which was a complaint I had about this place before. Overall:  Though I get dirty looks and jeers from people for going to a chain restaurant, I've grown to like this place because  of the quality of food and service they've provided each time I've come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=200
Stef S.,"Austin, TX",90,262,116,4.0,6/9/2012,"Come on, admit it: you've chuckled at the name, too. Regardless, BJ's is one of the better chains out there. I like to think of it as the Cheesecake Factory for Men: both have ridiculously large portions for what you pay for and extensive menus. There's something for everybody when the menu is the length of a novel.  As with many brewhouse eateries, I think the house beer is made so as not to overwhelm the food. I can't think of one that's really memorable besides the berry cider that they have, and that's only sort of related to the beers. The berry cider is like a fizzy pinky-purpley glass of fruity Sprite. It's fantastic. I haven't had a beer here that I haven't liked, but I haven't had one that I'd go out of my way to seek out, either. They're all pretty simple brews--no strong flavors or complex flavor combinations. So, I suppose they're good to sip on with food.  The food and service at this BJ's are the bigger reasons why I'd come back. Service was attentive. Even when I've just ordered a glass of water because it was past my bedtime (hey, get off my lawn!), they made sure that it always stayed full. The food is a bit less salty and processed-tasting than many chains and for that, I'm thankful. The salmon is flavorful, flaky and huge. The deep-dish pizzas--while not a true Chicago-style deep dish--are still fantastic. They're like big, fluffy cheese breads with fabulous toppings all over. Their take on the southwestern eggroll is delicious and not over-fried to the point of being greasy and gross. Overall, it's pretty tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=200

I walked up to her and asked for her to remove the charge and she did. No ""I'm sorry I did not mean to charge you for that"" . WOW!

Today I lunched with my parents at the Arbor Walk location - this location is about 2 years old - awesome decor and menu updates. Our server, Andrew, although new (which he told us, otherwise we'd never have known) was exceptionally friendly and outgoing. He really took care of my mom and made suggestions for her drinks. The coursing was timed just right, and Andrew checked on us no fewer than 5 times, we needed for nothing. We notified Andrew's manager of his terrific performance and after sharing our appreciation with Andrew, the manager gave us a few 'thank you' gift cards. (PS I had the sesame chicken salad - was yummy). With an updated decor, menu and look - BJ's always provides a great casual dining experience.

Came at 2pm on a Sunday and there was no wait.  Waitress came over immediately and my fiance ordered a Chimay Red and I got a root beer with a double shot of Absolut vanilla. Sublime.  We ordered the chicken pot stickers for appetizers and they were delicious.  A short time later our entrees arrived. My fiance ordered the new mahi mahi tacos and really enjoyed them. I got my usual broiled Atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice. It came with a huge amount of butter-soaked vegetables that I just pushed to the side. I got the chardonnay-lemon sauce on the side and it was SO good. Salmon portion was HUGE. Perfectly cooked. I ordered 3 drinks and was surprised to be charged $3.90 for the root beer all 3 times. I guess no free refills on that since I was ordering $10 worth of vodka. Thought they'd throw in the root beer for free the 2nd and 3rd times.

Even the manager was a Debbie Downer. After the crazy wait, our food came out completely wrong! His response, ""well, it'll go to waste if I take it back"".

Swap in beer instead of cheesecake as the signature item. Make the menu only slightly less epic, add a few televisions and - voilá - you pretty much have BJ's. I start with their house-brew pale ale - quite hoppy enough to pass for an IPA, and pretty darn decent stuff. Went well with the appetizer sampler platter, complete with all the requisite fried goodies - cheese sticks, southwestern and avocado egg rolls as well as spinach-artichoke dip. All standard-issue quality, though the avocado egg rolls vanished first. For entrees, my fish and chips was good, the cajun pasta passable, and the baby back ribs a bit below par. Portions were massive, so our plans for dessert were replaced with overstuffed moans and to-go boxes. Service was attentive but a bit schizo - we had a newbie waiter as well as his trainer serving us, so there was a fair amount of overeagerness and confusion about who was fetching what. No stars off for that but no bonus, either. All-in-all an impressive interior, a vast selection of passable but mediocre food (at least based on our sampling), large portions and decent prices. And with the concept of the place so parallel to that of The Cheesecake factory, I'll have to remind myself not to refer to it as The BJ Factory.

However my parents did order the Chicken marsala and it was PERFECT! compared to Cheesecake when leftovers are taken home... it results in a really not so cool leftover.

The clam chowder was some of the best I've had in recent years. My dining companions had salad, pizza and chili. They both had good things to say about the food. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is upscale casual. It's more like a really nice Applebee's. Cover Three has similar decor, if you're familiar with that restaurant/bar.

Kate  G.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2015,"I will never be coming back to BJ's again after my last experience.  Over the holidays, my parents came into town and we made a reservation at BJ's due to its family-friendly atmosphere (we had a 2 year old and 6 month old in our group). Our server appeared to be high and had a lot of trouble getting the order straight with our table. Ok, whatever, this is Austin - as long as the food comes out it will be fine. The appetizers and drinks came out with no issues.  When the food came out, ALL but one order was incorrect. (We had a party of 7). None of the pizzas had sauce OR tomatoes. The one vegan pizza that was ordered was covered in sausage. The two year old's macaroni and cheese took about 40 minutes to come out and his fries never did show up. A manager came by to apologize about the macaroni and cheese taking so long, so we took the opportunity to let her know that all of the food came out with errors. Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue, she argued with us. 'The sauce is baked into the pizza.' We tore the pizza apart to show her, no, there is no sauce and the deep dish pizza promises cooked delicious tomatoes. She then took about 10 minutes and came back with an ice cold cup of ice cold chopped salad tomatoes. Again, never apologizing for our completely ruined dinner. No one but one person was able to eat their dinner in the restaurant. She re-made one of the deep dish pizzas into a thin crust pizza to go and came back and acted like she did us some big favor (even though it was not asked for and was not what was ordered).  I could go on and on, but the unprofessionalism of the manager alone was enough to never bring me back. They took some money off of the bill, but considering that no one was able to eat and our entire evening was completely ruined, they should have waived the entire bill.  I emailed corporate to let them know how things are being run at this location and was sent back a standard form email with a $25 gift voucher attached - even though I will never use it and never ever go back. I strongly suggest you go anywhere else.  This restaurant would be great if they didn't have so many staffing issues and incompetent rude people. Too bad.

The menu is strong all around: good salads, pizza, wings, burgers, and just about anything else you could want.  The beer menu is large, offering both in house brewed beers and others on tap. Prices are average for a brewhouse. Be careful about going here during peek times, especially on weekends. The wait can get long. The place sports a ton of flat screens, so it makes a great place to have a meal and catch the game. The staff is generally attentive and helpful, although we did have a newbie that was so nice it was borderline scary.

In a pinch, I hoped this would be a place for ""Suburban Factory Food the Safe Mom"".  Nope.  I would rather have spent my money at Chili's or McDonald's.  And with the size of the building, I was hoping too for at least a halfhearted effort to have beer served that was actually brewed on-site.  Nope. Service was slow and borderline of poor, the portions were smaller than I expected, and the beer was good but overpriced.  The fried chicken --with a scant plop of gravy-- tasted similar to Chick-Fil-A so one star there.

Owen P.,"Austin, TX",3,14,2,4.0,5/22/2011,"TL;DR: Good food, variety, lots of beer, sort of high prices, get there early. This is more like a 4.5 star review because I feel the prices need adjustment. We went at about 5:30 PM on a Saturday of opening week. We were seated immediately, but by about 6:15 the lobby was packed. You might want to call ahead, but this might change as the new wears off. The booth seemed a little small, but the dining area wasn't crowded. It was quite noisy though; don't expect an intimate date night. There were plenty of kids there but I'm not sure I'd call it kid-friendly. It was noisy enough people might not notice a loud kid though; that might be a plus. The menu's big and is all over the place. Pizzas, burgers, salads, fish; it was kind of like The Cheesecake Factory only not quite as bewildering. The pizzas look interesting, but I decided on a Pirahna Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. My wife got some kind of cajun pasta dish. Neat tip: you can nix the chicken and go shrimp-only on some dishes even though the menu doesn't say so. Maybe we paid more for it; I didn't check. The cheeseburger was a true knife and fork affair; it was served open faced because no way could it be eaten like a normal burger. I found it quite tasty and prepared well, though the chili was much better than the burger part. My wife's pasta dish was a pasta dish; it's hard to get blown away by pasta. I was born and raised in Louisiana and no one ever seems to get that ""Cajun"" means ""spicy"". Portions were big; my cheeseburger was too much and my wife had 2 meals from the leftovers. This balances the prices; I paid $10 for a chili cheeseburger with fries and hers was maybe $15. Service was OK considering it's the first week. Some of the waitstaff seemed inexperienced, but everyone seemed nice and willing to please. I was *just* starting to think it was taking a while to get my food when I heard my waiter complaining to a manager that we'd been waiting a while, then the manager apologized. They were *busy* so I wasn't concerned; the food showed up shortly afterwards. I'm not a beer snob so I'll leave those reviews to someone else. I got the Pirahna Pale Ale and liked it, but my wife's Jeremiah Red was better. They've got a list of brews that the restaurant makes and they range from a few lights to some stouts and porters; there ought to be something for everyone. It cost us $40 to get two entrees and two pints of beer. I think it probably should have been more like $35 and could have done with smaller portions to offset it. I'd like to try a pizza and see if those are worth the price. My only regret is I got so full from the cheeseburger I couldn't order one of the pizookie desserts. It's a cookie in a deep dish cooked like a pizza smothered with various ice cream toppings; it reminds me of the Cookie Monster dessert at Cheddar's. I'll be back for it. I'm not sure what could make this a 5-star restaurant. The food can't get much better without higher prices; trying to make it quieter ruins the sports bar atmosphere; lowering the prices doesn't really offset either of the two. I'd say I walked in expecting a three-star experience and I got a little bit better than 4. Exceeds expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=240

Robert S.,"Pflugerville, TX",58,67,,1.0,2/10/2013,"I have always liked BJ's and have dined at several around the state. No matter which one I go to my order comes out wrong half the time. Once I ordered a small pizza and got a REALLY small pizza. About four inches across. The waiter said he misunderstood and ordered me the correct size which I wasn't charged for and gave me a small salad while I waited so I could at least have something to eat with the rest of my table. Another time I was asked if I wanted the shoestring fries or the wedge fries. I got the kind I didn't order.  Today I ordered the open face Pot Roast sandwich and that is when seemingly all hell broke loose. Here is the menu description: ""Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables."" My waitress asked what kind of fries I wanted. I double checked the menu to see if I read it right and showed her that it came with veggies as it already had mashed potatoes. I asked her why I would want fries on an item that already came with potatoes and she just shrugged and said, ""You never know.""  Now here is where things get complicated. If a menu item says a dish comes ""with"" something that means in addition to right? Catfish WITH coleslaw. Hamburger WITH fries. Am I not right? The server brings my food MINUS the veggies after what I had just gone through with the waitress. I call him back and he says he will go get them and brings them to me a few minutes later.  This should be the end of the story but no. He makes a point to return to the table presumably to ask me if I liked the veggies to which I responded in the affirmative. He then makes a big point of saying he's glad and that he was going to ""take care"" of them to make me happy even though they don't come with the meal and that in fact the veggies mentioned on the menu description were already included on my plate. What was he referring to? The mushroom gravy on my potatoes? The celery garnish? The handful of shredded carrots? Had he just shut up when he brought me the veggies I wouldn't be writing this. Yes I know the customer is always right but he made a big point of saying I was WRONG but he comped me the veggies that should have been included in the meal to begin with just to make me happy. Big man! you gave 20 cents of ""free"" veggies. Happy now? Way to go! Make yourself look superior to a customer over a cupful of veggies that cost next to nothing.  Had I accepted the offer to SUBSTITUTE fries for my veggies I guess it would have not been an issue but asking for something that was already included in my meal seemingly makes me a problem customer to the employees.  I emailed the management saying they need to amend the menu description from just, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables."" to, ""Served with oven roasted vegetables and a free double helping of grief from the restaurant employees."" For the record the sandwich was delicious but I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have because the attitude of the employees left a real bitter taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=240

Kristina B.,"Pflugerville, TX",98,96,109,3.0,5/29/2011,"I think I can like this place.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it seems like it would be a fun place to watch a game.  We first attended the soft opening with its short menu. I hated it. Because I am vegetarian, I had one option, the Asian Chicken salad minus the chicken. It was awful, but not because it was gross, but because it is not something I would ever even order.  I did, however, fall in love with the mash potatoes on my boyfriends plate.  I don't think I have ever had such delicious mashed potatoes in my life. So it was worth a second chance.  I kept it generic today  with the veggie burger and fries and yum! I wasn't disappointed.  The portion was huge so I saved half for later.  Boyfriend had chicken fried steak with the same heavenly mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  His plate looked good and he finished it all up, so thumbs up. We tried one of their deserts, I don't remember what they call it, but some sort of pizza cookie. A chocolate cookie + Ghirardelli chocolate squares + chocolate ice cream= Chocolate Coma. The desert was definitely decadent and rich, not something you can eat every day, but definitely worth it.  Our server was nice, but not very helpful.  I think we had three different people bringing our food and water, so we were never lacking anything.  I can't really say much more about the service.  Next time I go back, I think I will ask for a plate of mashed potatoes and maybe some veggies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=240

Jennifer P.,"Austin, TX",59,103,2,2.0,6/11/2011,"This might be a good place to get a few beers at the bar. But it wasn't a great place to get a meal. The kitchen has no idea what it's doing and the place is so poorly laid out that you have to ask other diners to scootch and press themselves into their tables in order to squeeze through the dining room. We had a table of 7. The shrimp lettuce wraps tasted ok but were really hard to eat (bad filling-to-lettuce ratio). The ribs were overcooked and tough. The ahi tuna had been seared at some point, but must have then been put in the fridge, because it was icy. The gluten-free pizza with extra cheese, came with hardly any cheese at all. Also, their gluten-free crust is herbed, which is a weird choice that I didn't like -- it overpowered the other flavors in the pizza. But the worst was my friend's dinner -- he ordered the salmon with spinach instead of rice. His plate came with rice, and no spinach. So he asked for the spinach, and a while later he was presented with a bowl of broccoli. Um, that's a vegetable and it's green, but still not spinach. By the time he finally got his spinach, he barely wanted it anymore. Not to mention that his fish smelled like it was slightly past its prime. The only food on the table that anyone loved was the broccoli cheese soup. We had one server who took our orders and checked up on us, and she was great -- the only positive aspect of our visit actually. But when the food was delivered, every single plate was brought to the table by a new and different person. I'll never understand that style of food service -- it's annoying to have to play air-traffic-controller with the plates and tell 7 different people where to place each plate. This style of service also held true for drink orders -- especially entertaining was the server who couldn't tell the difference between a pint of beer and a pint of raspberry cider. (Wow, really dude? The pink one is the beer? Really?) So, bad food, inconsistent service, and a dining room you have to squeeze and shimmy through just to move through it? No thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=240

After taking forever to narrow down what we wanted, we ordered and then our waitress came back to tell us that 3 of the things ordered were out (we ordered appetizers and some side things to share). Seriously?! Why have such a HUGE menu if you aren't going to keep things in stock? After a little more time we finally were able to order and then the food was just meh. Nothing to really go back for. It was really loud and busy, so it took a while to get our stuff and all around we were unimpressed. SO bummed! I will say that the waitress was awesome.

Alex R.,"Austin, TX",288,31,1,3.0,6/13/2011,"Went there for the first time yesterday for lunch. The good: the place is huge, nice decor, has flat screens everywhere if you want to keep up with games, getting seated took no time - great with a toddler. Plus, a very deep, diverse menu with a lot of options, including a full slate of options for kids. It's family friendly in that way. I didn't have any this time, but they have a nice selection of micro brewed beer. The bad: the prices are a bit steep, so it can't just be your neighborhood weekly place, since it is a bit overpriced. They have a ton of TVs so when we walked in, I asked the bartender if they could put one of the TVs on the Astros-Braves game and she said she would but never got around to it.  Maybe it's because it's a chain, not sure why, but our server was over zealous. As someone who used to wait to tables, it's always better to check too much on a table than too little, but we couldn't even get a bite of food in our mouth before the server was in our faces asking how the food was - ""don't know, haven't eaten a bite yet - it just arrived this second"" - was my response with both the appetizer and dinner. In addition, when you're dealing with a toddler, if you look at him and ask him if he wants ""chocolate"" he will say yes - which is why a good server should be thoughtful of parents and look at the parents and simply ask if we want dessert - we had to cut our server off in mid sentence since we knew our son would create a problem being offered chocolate and us having to say no. Not OK for the server to go past us just to try and make a buck.  The manager was a nice game and came over afterwards to check on us so overall, they are friendly, but they could relax a little more & have their servers tamp down their upselling and overzealousness.  In addition, while the adult meals they brought us were good and had nice presentation, my son ordered mac n cheese and it was clearly the same 'instant Kraft' we could make him at home.  Overall, I'd go back but they need fix a few things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=240

Greg S.,"Austin, TX",3,59,,4.0,11/11/2011,"Color. It's what any aspiring ""great"" restaurant must have in both food presentation and ambiance to be successful. BJs has both. Love a place that has a splashiness about it? Tell you one thing...it was packed pre-lunch hour. That tell you anything. It certainly falls under the same category as the old saying about what separates a good Chinese restaurant from a poor one. If there's a line outside waiting to get in the food must be aces. No line at BJs put the joint was jumping with celebratory and business-oriented (I suppose) conversation. The open bar is all the way open. Just enter and look to your right. In the right spirit for spirits? A colorful array of beer and booze enablers await you. After hearing my mother brag about the quality of the food on more than one occasion I had to make a point of stopping by. That's a use of at liberty time any Veteran's Day holiday observer would be proud of. The only places I can recall being this inviting from an interior standpoint would have to be Dave & Buster's and Pappadeaux's. They spare no expense to roll out the full red carpet of culinary enticements. The decor whets your whistle for what you'll soon be ordering. There's a long aisle full of booth space. You'll even notice candelabras off to the left.  Onward and most definitely upwards to the food we go. I went with the safe bet house salad. Cucumbers were beefy. The carrots were a thinly sliced visual feast. The balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing had some classy zing to it. One thing I noticed about the croutons that isn't usually a given with most salads of this persuasion. They weren't overly crunchy. Your teeth sort of sink into the soft level of crunch. Fine by me. Gives me more room to savor the whole grain flavor.  On this day the main course was plucked straight from the old reliable section of the menu known as SANDWICHES. Be prepared to either have ample leftovers or a best bud with a hollow leg who doesn't main doing his fair share to both satisfy his own cravings and keep those dollars rolling into the national economy. Exhibit A was the grilled chicken club. This monster's a two-handed job for sure. The marinated chicken breast was blissfully tender. The bacon was suitably crunchy. Don't take that last reveal for granted. I've had bacon-filled sandwiches in some establishments where the bacon was tough and overly stringy. Those aren't two traits I like in my bacon. If it crunches and you can taste the beads of grease forming on your tongue I'm the proverbial happy customer. I'll forgive the line staff for not omitting the roasted garlic mayo as I requested in my lame ass attempt to show a little restraint. It added something divine to the overall taste. The grilled sourdough bread it's served on at least in terms of appearance reminded me of the grilled cheese sandwich grill marks Mom made for me as kid. Trust me the sourdough is the perfect flavor match for what's sitting in between. All the sandwich possibilities that don't answer to the name of ""Burger"" come with either wedge-cut or thin and crispy fries. I ordered the latter. Time to get that best bud to, as you seem to always see articulated in the Sports section during crunch time moments, step up. Generous doesn't even begin to describe this heap of slashed spuds. You could pick your teeth with them to dislodge the sandwich remains. They're that thin. What they lack in size they make up for in taste. Neato with a capital N. Had I eaten them all there would have been no room in my gullet for... Dessert. Your physician shudders at the word. Your ultra-sensitive side seeks it out with Pavlovian regularity. I don't want to be part of a world where the possibility of partaking of it doesn't exist. BJs has you covered. I'd have to have ""dumb"" writ large on my forehead were I to refuse one of their noteworthy Pizookies. Just say that word and you're six years old again. Two dessert classics I humbly bow down to are Cookies 'n'  Cream ice cream and Oreos. You wouldn't be considered quackers if, upon polishing off the Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie, you'd officially claimed you just had a religious experience. Heavenly Oreo cookie, yummy be thy name, thy reason for being, let yourself be adorned by 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and Cookies 'n' Cream mousse. Infidels need not enter the kingdom of decadence. Wasn't it Billy Joel who said ""I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints?"" LMAO. The waitstaff was on its game. Finished plates were taken away on the spot. My server, upon noticing I wasn't quite finished with dessert promised he wasn't trying to rush me. How often are you made to feel like a valued customer and not just a link in the table turn over chain? That merits three stars right off. BJs is way more than OK. It'll tantalize you inside and out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=320

Maybe that's what led to the mistake that ensued:  I ordered a calzone.  I figured if the pizzas are really good, the calzones are probably just as good.  But first I was served the wrong order.  They brought me someone else's calzone, so obviously I sent it back.  I got the correct one soon enough, but it was almost half dough.  That was a big disappointment.  Paying that much for just a loaf of bread just isn't right.  I said as much to the server, who just agreed that yes, it was a lot of dough. I'm sure I will return here, but I have to lower the rating for now. ********* This place reeks of chain restaurant, but that's not entirely bad.  The ambience is raucous and loud, and given that there is a huge -- and I mean HUGE -- set of 4 TV screens behind the bar it stays like that most of the time.  If you can ignore that everything else about this place is good.  The TV screens obviously makes this place a sports bar type of place, but the food is a step up from that kind of food.  If you've experienced Cover 2 and Cover 3, B.J.'s tries to be that kind of place. The pizzas are their specialty.  They are very good, actually.  I have had the Meat Lover's equivalent.  I liked it.  Unless you're barely hungry you should get a small.  The mini is barely more than a pizza roll. The seared ahi tuna small bite is actually very good.  Be careful with the wasabi, though.  It's about twice as strong as any wasabi I've had with sushi, so it can be overpowering. My choice the past couple of times has been a salad.  Their BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent.  This last time I tried the honey chicken salad.  It was ok.  Not that great, but still good.  I tried it with the bleu cheese dressing, but the dressing had gone bad.  If you try anything with the bleu cheese dressing ask for it on the side.  It can go bad. Their beer selection is very good.  If you're looking for a place to go just for the beer and some pub food to watch a game, this is an excellent option.  They have seasonal beers that rotate in and out of their lineup, as well as plenty of other domestic and international choices. It's a great place for parties and groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300
Laura G.,"Austin, TX",8,11,1,1.0,7/30/2011,"The boyfriend and I hoped visiting BJ's would provide us with a new local pub that served both great food and beer.  I should have know it was not to be when my arm almost broke due to weight of menus the hostess handed me.  The interior of this ""pub"" is not pub like whatsoever, it is more of a steakhouse decor than anything else.  Dark, dreary and cold!  We opted for the bar which seemed more inviting due to better lighting.  Now to tackle that menu...  I immediately had unpleasant flashback to Cheesecake Factory visit where I developed a headache reading the 50 page menu.  BJ's menu is overwhelming and overpriced for what they offer.  They are trying way to hard.  The cheapest beer in the house was 4.95??  Oh but wait its HH the beers are all 1$ off (menu page 15 stated).  So okay we try some of their specialty brewed beers and two appetizers (I'll stick to apps when a burger is 11$). Sadly the disappointment continued ...  The beers were the best part of the visit, though not great they were solid (hence the one star).  The app sampler plater that we ordered ""to try all our best apps"" was cold and unoriginal.  I could have put this platter together gathering samples at Costco on a Saturday afternoon!  The avocado egg rolls were literally disgusting (boyfriend disposed of his bite in napkin discretely).  They were tasteless, oliy and mushy with a weird yet horrific honey sauce??  The mini burgers were better but hard to mess those up and for 10$ I will make my own. We got the check as soon as possible still hungry and thirsty.  The service is unimpressive, the food is horrible and the beer you could find somewhere else cheaper.  I wish this place would have stayed in Dallas because it has no place in Austin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300

Alfred L.,"Round Rock, TX",0,55,,4.0,11/4/2011,"Personally, I think the name of the Restaurant blows (pause for laughter). OK, now that we've gotten the inappropriate jokes out of the way, lets get to business. I walked into Bj's already having information about the place. The CEO here once ran Cheesecake Factory, so I had great expectations. This place would be CCF if CCF painted their ceilings black, pushed the dimmer switch down a little bit more and placed several big screens around the place. It has a louder, more festive atmosphere than CCF. Its nice. A good place to bring a date and they stay open on weekends til 1am. Yay! No more having to go to the taco stands at Rundberg and Lamar with my wife backed up against me, her hand in her purse with her finger on the trigger of her Glock while I try to scarf down a few taquitos... The CEO brought along some nuances of CCF in case you missed going there: 1. Waiters with aprons (white over black, instead of white over white) 2. Telephone book menu that you need a Kindle to read through 3. attentive food servers 4. nice atmosphere 5. large portions I had the crispy jalapeno burger with fires. My wife had some huge salad, I think it was Sante Fe something or other. They were both very good. reminded us of Cheesecake factory, or have I mentioned this already? For dessert, we had a red velvet pizookie. Think cookie dough placed in the oven, then taken out at just the right time and slap on two scoops of vanilla. We rolled our way out to the parking lot minutes later. Price alert!!  They call it a Brewhouse because they brew their own beer. No problem. The food servers go out of their way to steer you to their home brews. Good strategy, no problem. Each pint is $6.00. Problem. Well, problem for me anyways, b/c I'm a cheap ass, but for the record, the blonde brew house is a good flavorful beer but the pumpkin ale? It was like tapping into a fresh pumpkin with a straw. But I still drank it. So, if the price of their beer is not an issue for you then go ahead. For another $1, you could go to HEB and buy a six pack of Miller lites. Over all, I would still come back for the food and I'll drink my beer elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300
Kellie H.,"Lee's Summit, MO",45,57,,2.0,8/27/2011,"We went here for dinner yesterday (Friday), it was pretty busy but the wait wasn't long. After we got seated our waitress brought our waters then walked off not even asking if we were ready to order (which we were), we waited another 5 minutes to order. Then we waited for our food for a good 10+ minutes which was very frustrating considering what we ordered shouldn't take that long. After we got our food the waitress only came by once and then disappeared for about 10 more minutes while we waited for our plates to be taken. My husband wanted to get the pizookie (which is delicious and a must at BJ's) so of course we waited yet again. I think we spend a good hour + at this restaurant waiting and waiting. I was not impressed at all.

Kali R.,"Austin, TX",7,80,,1.0,4/26/2012,"This place is two for two for me in disappointment.  The first time I tried it, months ago, I cut it slack because it had opened fairly recently, but my burger was on the stalest bun I have ever tasted.  I brought it to the waiter's attention and he shrugged me off, but when the manager came by, I pointed it out to him as being inedible.  Props to him for going back to the kitchen and discovering that the entire bag of whole wheat buns were in that condition. My meal was comped and I figured I would give it another try in the future Fail, part deux.  This time I brought my mother along after a Dr. appt. in the area and she ordered the broiled tilapia while I tried the soup and salad combo featuring clam chowder. The chowder was hot and tasty; the salad was insipid and forgettable.  But that wasn't the big problem.  The waiter brought my entire meal out nearly 15 minutes before my mother's meal arrived.  I was forced to go ahead and at least eat my soup before it got cold, while my Mom got the dubious pleasure of watching me.   To top off the questionable experience (BTW, the waiter never came by before bringing her entree out), Mom's tilapia meal was lukewarm.  We opted not to spend the additional time for them to warm it up and again, when the manager came by, we pointed out the problems and suggested that when entrees like this are delivered, it is usual to bring the salad out ahead (if the patron agrees), but not a great choice to bring the entire lunch for one while the other waits. He agreed and they comped half of the check.  I don't know how they can survive with this kind of performance, but I will not be going there again.  There are too many good options in that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300

Peylin F.,"Austin, TX",66,137,,3.0,9/14/2011,"BJs reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory (their menu is like a book just like Cheesecake's) but with lots of tvs for sports watching, so that is a plus. This review is only based on their pizza since that's all I've had the few times I've gone. People have raved about their pizza the most, so I figure why not try it? If you like Chicago, deep dish style pizza, then you'll like what BJs offers. The pizzas might not look that big, but since the slices are so thick, you fill up pretty quickly. The sweet pig pizza (Pineapple, seasoned tomatoes and oven-roasted ham) is just your typical hawaiian pizza, and the BJ's favorite pizza (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) is just like a fancy shmancy supreme pizza. Both were pretty tasty and worth having again. We did take advantage of their 2 for $20 deal which comes with a side salad, a pizza to share, and a pizookie to share. I admit that I went with this deal because I really wanted to try their pizookie, which according to them is a deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. Supposedly this is what they are famous for (besides their beer). The side salad? Meh. Nothing to write home about. The pizza was good as usual, but the biggest disappointment was the pizookie. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia with vanilla bean ice cream. Any warm dessert a la mode is good, but I was expecting something bigger and thicker. The cookie was pretty thin, and it was a bit too sweet. The ice cream did balance it out, but in the end we had more ice cream than cookie left, which normally doesn't happen. I compare their pizookie to the cookie monster at Cheddar's, and the cookie monster is SO much better. The only thing that the pizookie has going for it is the fact that you have many types to choose from. If I come back again, I'll probably check it out during happy hour and take advantage of the half deal on their mini pizzas which is probably the perfect size for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=300

When my dinner arrived 10 minutes later the rib-eye steak was covered in pepper - and therefore tasted like pepper. Also the steak was raw inside. My companions were asked to check their steak doneness but I was not. The WORST vegetables ever. They were raw. Huge chunks of squash and cauliflower. The green beans were barely cooked. None of the vegies were seasoned with anything and the steak was over seasoned. Even my iced tea was watered down and tasteless. The wait service was not good either. Waiter kept interrupting us. He seemed fine with talking to us but could not remember to refill my tea. I had to ask many times.  Also waiter did not know the beer menu.

Dawnielle A.,"Austin, TX",32,19,3,3.0,6/26/2011,"Today was my second time going to this brand new place in the Arbor Walk area.  The first time my boyfriend and I went during lunch. They have a great selection for a lunch menu. The soups are excellent! But what got me the most is that our server didn't know anything about the menu. I would ask the server what comes on the wedge salad (because I am a huge fan of wedge salads) and she replied ""I don't know."" The first thing I learned as a server or any position in the restaurant is to know your menu so you can sell it. The server couldn't sell me on anything. Again, today was the second time being there. The hostess was very friendly; however, told me that I could sit at a high top if I wanted to. It was just me and I don't want to take up a table that could sit 6 people. I asked if I could sit outside. There really wasn't a wait which was really cool. In the shade it felt fabulous! The person who escorted me outside was very friendly and helpful. I completely thought that he was my server. He was kind enough to get me some water while I wait for my server. That was very sweet of him! However, my turn-off about this place is that I sat outside for over 5 minutes with no one to greet me. I read the entire menu twice and was ready for a nice cold beer. Many servers came outside and not one said ""Someone will be right with you."" I could understand that if someone did say that but they didn't.  I went to go talk to the manager not looking for any handouts. I just wanted to let him know about what kind of service I got so he can make his restaurant better. He was super nice and pleaded for me to stay. I told him that I wasn't into it anymore but don't worry I will be back.  I will be back and I hope my next server will know what they are doing.

Bill S.,"Austin, TX",1,6,,1.0,10/10/2011,"Atmosphere was nice, but the food was awful. We ordered Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as appetizers. The artichokes were awful and tasted like the vinegar brine that low-end canned artichokes come in. We couldn't eat them. The mushrooms were thoroughly bland and had no flavor at all. I had ice tea and my wife ordered a marguerita. She said her drink tasted like it had been made with ice in a blender rather than in a frozen marguerita machine. She said it barely had any taste other than ice.  I had the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I chose a minestrone soup. The soup looked and tasted exactly like Progresso's canned minestrone. The entree tasted like it had just been warmed up in the microwave. The pasta did not appear to be fresh. The artichokes in it tasted just like the ones in the appetizer, a heavy brine taste. I couldn't eat them either. It was supposed to come with fresh steamed baby spinach. There were only 3 leaves of it on my plate.  My wife had the Brewhouse Blond Shrimp. She had the broccoli-cheddar soup with it.  It also looked and tasted like fresh out of the can. The description of her entree suggested a lightly battered, tempura-like crust, very lightly fried entree. What came on her plate was very dark, deep fried, corn meal encrusted, barely edible shrimp. My wife ate two of them. I tasted one and didn't want another bite. The cole slaw was inedible; however the thin crispy fries were very tasty.  The service was adequate, but not exceptional. To her credit, our waitress took the artichoke appetizer off our ticket when we told her how bad they were. We are not restaurant snobs. We have favorite places, both chain and local. We like to occasionally try new places. We always hope for the best, but BJ's Brewery came closer to the worst. I would have considered the prices reasonable if the food had been tasty.

Ryan A.,"Austin, TX",179,36,1,3.0,12/24/2011,"Generally speaking, I'm a very forgiving person when it comes to poor service and/or bad food. I'm a firm believer that everyone deserves a second (or in this case, third) chance to account for any unusual circumstances which are bound to happen in the service industry. Unfortunately, BJ's used up the last of its three chances today when a friend and I tried it out for lunch.  We arrived around 2:30 or 3:00 to a mostly empty restaurant and a very friendly greeting from the hostess and were sat immediately. We were greeted semi-promptly by our server who took our drink order and returned with  water (until my beer arrived) and a soda for my friend. He then asked me what I had ordered to drink because he forgot. Eh, it happens...no big deal. Five minutes go by with no beer. A few more go by before our server walks by the table and says ""What happened to your beer? They told me it went out!"" I jokingly say ""Where did it go?"" and proceed to speculate as to why my beer has now taken nearly ten minutes to find our table during lunch, when service should be much quicker than any other time of day. He left the table, went to the bar, returned to our table and told me that they were changing the keg at the moment. I attempted to order a different beer, in hopes that I would actually get it, but our server said that the beer I had initially ordered would be up when he returned to the bar. Finally, after at least ten minutes of waiting, I was sipping on a nice, cold, delicious beer. It was then that I decided that I would not be ordering another and that it would be best for me to make this one last throughout the duration of the meal. After the beer situation was sorted out, we went unacknowledged for a few minutes more before our order was taken. My friend tried to order a lunch item, which is only available Monday through Friday. Ok, fine, we didn't see the fine print at the top of the lunch menu...our mistake, but that doesn't change the fact that only offering a special lunch menu Monday - Friday is just plain silly. We ordered our entrees along with an appetizer and two salads.  Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... A stone-faced, emotionless server (not our own) arrives with the appetizer we ordered, sets it on the table, and walks away without a friendly greeting/salutation, or asking whether we needed anything else at the moment. Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... A manager arrives at our table with both or our salads in hand and greets us with a very friendly salutation, asks if we need anything else, and walks away, never once acknowledging the fact that his restaurant is running at the pace of a dead turtle. Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock..... Our entrees fiiiinnnaaalllyyyyyy arrive at LEAST a half hour after we ordered them. Our server delivered our food and acknowledged that fact that they had taken much longer than they should have to come out and that he had alerted his manager, who was in the process of ""yelling at the kitchen"" for the long time order. Food quality is consistently okay here and both my friend and I were satisfied with what we ordered. At $13.00 per entree at lunch time, you get what you pay for. An hour and a half, and $40 later, we found ourselves asking for the check ASAP after our food was delivered at our table, since we didn't know how long it would take for it to be delivered. Strangely enough, it was on the table a minute or two after we had asked for it. Hmmm....?! On my previous two visits to BJ's (both during dinner), I've not had anything to be unhappy about. The service was as prompt as could be expected for a moderately busy dinner shift, our server was extremely friendly and skilled, and the food was good.

Rusty W.,"Austin, TX",1,7,,3.0,9/8/2014,"Yesterday was my second visit to BJ's, and I would have to stay it is a step down from my previous experience.  I was seated fairly quickly with my party of 10 or so, and my server was pretty good.  I tried my friend's hose made Root Beer, and I have to say it was excellent.  I ordered the bone-in New York Steak cooked medium, with a side of clam chowder and loaded baked potato.  The clam chowder came out first and I was surprised at the portion size, larger than expected.  It tasted good, but was nothing special.  The steak temperature was spot on, but the taste was bland, as if there were no seasoning, or if the seasoning was put on after the cooking, not cooked into the meat.  The only complaint I have about service is that I asked for the loaded baked potato, which in my experience comes with butter, cheese, sour cream, and in some cases bacon bits.  I only received the butter and sour cream, no cheese or bacon bits.  This was not a huge deal for me personally, but is important as a service point and in presentation.  I will be back eventually, but probably not for a steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=280

DAVID S.,"Austin, TX",1,22,,2.0,8/8/2011,"Quite honestly the most disappointing pizza I've EVER had. After having lived ( and eaten ) in Chicago for over 12 years, I tend not to expect true Chicago-style pizza from a restaurant not in Illinois, but this example of Chicago-style pizza fails even when compared to the selection in the freezer section of HEB. The crust was nice and thick at the edges but it was even thicker in the MIDDLE of the pizza.  The amount of cheese on this one was so sparse, the I could see single strands of the mozzarella close to the center of the pie. I ordered a regular pizza with sausage, mushroom and onion.  At first glance, I was embarrassed for BJs... the sausage was in pellet form ( ya you know like on the frozen pizza referenced above).  There was very little sauce, I guess using chunks of tomatoes satisfies the ""red"" part of the pizza. OK, I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed in the pizza... But the very surprising thing was that 2-pages of their large menu was dedicated to promoting their outstanding pizza, with multiple topping combos, piping hot 4 cheese blend.   I believe BJs would be better served by instead of paying their menu authors they consulted a cook from Pizzeria-UNO , Genos East or Lou Malnatis to give them a hint what Chicago-style pizza was like. yuck yuck yuck 2 stars given for beer, but their in-house brews were more expensive than the commercial brands, which is a little disappointing, since that is a small incentive to try the home-brewed beer Service is good, but extremely choreographed, as they ask if you if things are OK, bordering on pestering.  But if you do ask for something extra, it takes longer than expected. Decent establishment, if you were in crowded city, but personal service, individual attention to fare ( including beer) goes a long way in  establishing repeat customers.

Other times it's - not really a big deal either way. I've eaten there 3-4 times and every time my entree has tasted fine, but it hasn't been anything special or worthy of eating out. There are tons of better options for every type of food on the menu. The most disappointing aspect of BJ's is that their personally hand crafted brews are subpar to everything else they have tap. Fortunately, what they have on tap is a reasonable selection of good beer. The ahi poke appetizer is really good so I'm happy ordering that when I go. The other times I keep trying out new dishes hoping to find something really enticing. The pazookie is an above average dessert too considering how many of them they probably make.

Their beer selection is outstanding and their house brews are very good.  My particular favorite is Tatanka Stout which every time I see that name I have to start quoting Dances With Wolves and thus I rename the beer buffalo stout.  This place has the beer selection but not the great food to go with it.   2.

We arrived at about 6:30 and it was completely packed. We somehow managed to grab a table after just a few minutes of waiting, but for those wanting to beat the happy hour rush, I recommend arriving early or visiting during their late happy hour.  It took a little bit longer than expected to find someone to greet us, but it's something that happens with any new restaurant that opens up, so it wasn't that big of a deal (hopefully this will improve as time goes by). Our waitress was very nice and was definitely trying her best. They had a nice selection of beer - my favorites were the hefeweizen and the blondie. I ordered the mini pizza (pepperoni, sausage), which I had to say was quite hearty and satisfying. The pan crust was crispy on the outside and had the warm, buttery texture on the inside. We shared a huge sampler appetizer plate which also had some good eats. I don't think there was anything really wrong with the place, except the food being greasier than I'd like it to be.

Texas F.,"Austin, TX",0,23,,2.0,3/7/2015,"The less-than attentive waitress really ruined a birthday lunch for a friend and I. We ordered a shareable appetizer, then decided on soup & salad for the main entrée. Coffee arrived first without enough condiments; the waitress was gone a long time as coffee cooled. When she finally did return & inquired about our order, I said she would get that when we got more sugar & half 'n half for our coffee. Placed the order and within five minutes here comes the salad, on its heels the delicious chicken tortilla soup (my favorite), which were served by other waiters. Again, our waitress (Abbie) pulled a Houdini. One of the waiters provided us more dressing for our salad. Then ""Abracadabra!"" here comes the appetizer. HA! My friend and I laughed at how ridiculous the service was as our soup cooled quickly in the wide-mouth, thick-lipped serving bowls. We sent the appetizer back; I asked for the manager, who appeared in time making lame apologies but not making any attempt to fix things. After his appearance, the waitress gave us the cold shoulder. One of their ""Pizookie"" desserts is offered for birthday customers, so my friend ordered one. It is an oversized cookie baked into an aluminum pan and served with a couple of scoops of ice cream. The dessert arrived and the dough was raw, not completely baked. It was sent back; the manager reappeared, saying, ""That's how we make it..."" as we wondered why would a restaurant serve undercooked cookie dough? I advised the manager to make it right and comp the soup. The full-baked Pizookie arrived later; our coffee was cold and the waitress made no attempt to offer more. After we finished what we wanted of the dessert, the aloof waitress swept by. without asking if we were through, and took away plates. When she brought our bill, I advised her to take it to the manager to get it right; he discounted my friend's meal and the dessert was ""on the house"" as her birthday gift, I suppose.

Gretchen D.,"Austin, TX",21,72,2,2.0,2/17/2013,"I was disappointed.  We went at 5pm on a Saturday, as we usually go out early because of our 2 year-old. Earlier usually means fewer crowds and faster service.  Well, it  was not extremely crowded, but the service was SO slow. Initially, our server came fast and was very pleasant. But once our order was in, it took at 45+ minutes to get our food.  I ordered the deep dish pizza, which was far from deep dish (I now read another review here stating their experience was the same - wish I had seen it before ordering!). It was basically a regular pizza, with slightly puffy crust. And upon our server stating that the small one was in fact really small (less than 6""), I opted for the next size up. Yes, it was enough, but it was NOT worth the $15 price tag. My husband got a steak (which he loves to do wherever we go) and said it wasn't great. It looked pretty charred on the outside, even though the inside was the right color. (The only upside was the baked potato with everything on the side came with nice chunks of what appeared to be fresh-cooked bacon, although it didn't have a lot of bacon flavor.) My brother got the jalapeno burger and it looked yummy and big. In the midst of conversation, I didn't get to ask him how it was, but it didn't look like he had complaints. Perhaps the burger is the way to go.  Overall, the prices are way too high for the food quality.

Richard M.,"Austin, TX",13,91,6,3.0,6/9/2011,"Well despite all the complaints about the service, our waitress was quite attentive and our drinks were never dry. The only mistake she made was after we finished our first beer she asked if we were ready for another round, we said yeah and reached for a menu. Before we had even picked it up she was already gone. We wanted to try something different but we wound up with refills of what we had already had. Not a real big deal and that was the only mistake. The good: They have an excellent beer selection and a fairly broad food menu. The bad: Nothing I'd really call bad. The indifferent: Although fairly nice, it DEFINITELY has a sterile, corporate feel, although far better than that sorry Brick House place up the road.  I had the Cajun pasta, it was not very impressive, about what I'd expect from a chain. Certainly not bad, there just wasn't anything all that special about it. I had their porter and their stout. The stout was the better of the two. Their porter is nitrogen conditioned, which is something I don't really care for and if I'd caught that before I ordered I probably would have skipped it. The stout was far more satisfying but certainly nothing out of the ordinary.

Carrie S.,"Austin, TX",205,63,127,4.0,6/16/2013,"First time here. We went at lunch when it was starting to get busy. Sat at the bar top. No waiting. Our bartender, Joe, was quick and attentive. Explained the brews to us. I chose a seasonal Belgium. My boyfriend with the brunette brown. Mine was a little hoppy if you like that. The brown was very smooth. We decided to go with a variety of appetizers. We had the tomato bisque, BBQ chicken chopped salad, stuffed mushrooms and the mac and cheese.  Our least favorite was the Mac and cheese. The 3 cheeses and bacon with bread crumbs was good, just a little dry. The mushrooms were yummy. The salad and bisque were the highlight of the day. The bisque was creamy and delicious. I would order both of those again. We signed up for their members perk program. They also have special dinners with highlighted beers.

The menu is pretty big, for drinks and food. We both ordered the Irish red beer which was pretty tasty. My friend ordered the santa fe salad which looked pretty loaded and delicious. i ordered the bbq chick chopped salad. His looked way better than mine... Full of avocado and veggies and a good dressing.. Mine looked like a bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of chicken and random pieces of corn. i was kinda disappointed.. Someone else's review of this salad said it was awesome and delicious, so maybe they were having an off night? Although we also split a side of the mac and cheese and the cheese was watery, didnt really stay on the pasta. Our server was friendly, cant complain about anything there.

I have never eaten here when the waitperson has not screwed up my order. They either take forever, bring the wrong thing, don't bring other things that you ordered, or they don't even enter in stuff that you ordered. So then you have to wait another 20 minutes while they cook your appetizer that was supposed to be out before the meal. Something is wrong with this place. The only reason I didn't give them NO starts was because I do kind of like the food. However, it's not worth the hell you have to go thru to get it.

""That's fine"", you say, ""if the tacos are awesome"". They were fish sticks in a tortilla. Tasted like Mom bought some Gordon's Fishermen sticks from HEB and put them in a tort with some mayo.

El V.,"Austin, TX",3,126,5,4.0,5/22/2012,"New lunch specials finally lured us in the door. Staff was great and place was spotless. Don't see many places with a revolving door! I had the en-light-end menu item with a half flat bread pizza (California) and it came with a tiny little salad where dressing was not evenly coating all the pieces of lettuce, a very minor thing. I want to reiterate, the salad was just tiny, but the half sized order of pizza was filling enough for a small lady like me. Nice touch leaving the cucumber and tomato on the side of the salad instead of mixing them in like most places do. The flat bread pizza was AMAZING! Crust was awesomely crispy and the toppings were just divine. My date had the classic burger with thin fries and it was fantastic. I would give 5 stars except that the staff was really trying to upsell us on appetizers and deserts to the point of being sorta annoying. Also tried to clear my date's plate while we were still munching on the last of his fries. Don't try to hurry us out when business is slow, if there were people waiting for a table we would've hustled but the lunch rush was definitely over. On the flip side we were checked on frequently and our drinks were always full, so great service on that aspect. I suspect the upselling tactic is an agenda pushed by management. Maybe I'd order the chips and salsa if they were not $5. I mean seriously, five bucks for chips and salsa (which many places give out for free) when the new chicken fried steak is only $6.50 until 3pm? What non-sense. Could write an entire second review on the beers. If you like beer you will NOT be left wanting.

Stephen M.,"Austin, TX",4,35,2,1.0,6/4/2012,"At BJ's Brewhouse North at Arborwalk on Saturday 2nd of June, 2012 after a graduation. We had a group of 16 people. We all arrived approx within 10min of each other. Table was set adequately. We ordered drinks for 4 people while we initially waited, took about 15 min. After all parties arrived we ordered food which took over a 45min hr to reach our table.  I ordered Angel Hair pasta Toscana. It arrived as Spaghetti and they didn't tell me it was going to be substituted. I alerted the manager. Nice guy. 20 min later the waiter came to tell me that they were going to substitute the pasta. It tasted good but dish would have been better suited with Angel Hair. They comp-ted my entree and it was a pleasant surprise. I was hoping for some free sour dough bread or salsa n chips but I guess BJs doesn't wanna give out those types of fillers for free. The raspberry tea I ordered was awful. Returned it and ordered regular sweet tea. Refills took about 45min to an hour. One server for 16 people. Our server said he had back up and the girl helping him told us she was helping out but bailed once the rest of our party arrived. Our waiter was very nice and apologetic. He got a good tip.

I have been to this location twice now and sat at the bar both times. If you want great service, grab a seat at the bar.  This location has a great beer selection in addition to their homemade brews. Not sure why you would come here to drink Miller Lite or some other watery beer unless you like paying $10 for a sandwich. Or $20 for a large pizza. Look, the food is okay. Both times I have gone to this location I ordered the pizza. Both times the dough-to-topping ratio has been way off. All dough and very little topping. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it.  But, I'm a sucker for big screens and beer so inevitably I give in and order food. The Jeremiah Red is delicious. The Grand Cru (they already ran out), even better. My suggestion would be to go during Happy Hour (3-7 I think) where they offer half price mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and $1 off their brews.

Van D.,"Round Rock, TX",2,4,,3.0,7/5/2012,"I came here July 3rd and it wasn't busy enough for there to be a waiting line, so that was great. I loved the lighting, atmosphere and company was pleasant so I was pretty open minded with the food.  As a heath conscious eater, I'm kinda wary of eating out because I'm never sure of the options available. And paying $10 for a salad? No. Just no. I can make those salads at home.  So with my eating habit, I was grateful to learn that BJ's have the ""Enlightened Entrees"", which are all under 575 calories. I chose the Creole Tilapia simply because I like fish and tomatoes. My two friends got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and a shrimp pasta dish, the name of which I couldn't remember. The guy who's not driving got a Jeremiah Red.  The food came out about 10 minutes later, which I think is decent. My dish was pretty decent. The fish is well-cooked, the sauce is good, the side salad is not bad. For those who don't eat too salty like me, know that the tapenade is salty because of the anchovies. On the health perspective, the dish is pretty balanced: a third each of grain, protein and vegetables. Overall, I would eat it again.  My friends had no complaints about their dishes. The Jeremiah Red, I had  a small sip of at the beginning of the meal, is good even though I don't drink beer in general. We ordered a triple chocolate pizookie because we heard it was good. Personally, I was way to rich for me so sharing was a good idea. While it was good and my friends did enjoy it to, we didn't finish it simply because it was so rich. I am glad to go back to my 72% dark chocolate and home made ice cream after that.  One complaint, the waiter was terrible with refilling water, terrible enough that one of friend got a bit mad and gave only $1 tip. And I got thirsty enough that I asked to drink from my friend's cup.  I will probably come back, although not anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=360

Derek J.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,3,1,2.0,4/28/2012,"Two stars is giving them the bonus of a rounding up from one star and change. The place was packed at 7:00p on a Friday and good for them, making money is why you're in the business after all. Don't set your expectations too high, it's not an uppity type of place, just what we were looking to try. Yes, 1st time at a BJ's, ever. Very sticky floor on the way over to the bar. Something must've spilled and wasn't cleaned up well at all. Our drinks were served within reasonable wait. We started with the Ultimate Iced Teas and chose to finish with them even though they were just okay ($10/ea.). Service was a very solid average. Reading the menu I notice the ""deep dish"" pizza. and think that's a great starter piece. We ordered the small sized (size #2 of 4) Classic Combo and added onion/pepper. The pizza came in expected time, however, it was just warm and not hot. The dough was chewy and seamed under-cooked. Toppings we distributed in an acceptable amount. Note: nothing ""great"" happening here, never mind excellent. Next we ordered the calamari. There was a reasonable amount and it was very warm, still not hot. But the squid was horrible. The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long. We are no strangers to some fried squid and this dish had to be worst I've ever had. Because of this, we closed out.

There was a good variety of dishes, with pizza, steak, wraps, burgers, salad, soup, and pasta. It would be a four stars, but there was only ONE vegan choice in the entire giant menu. This was the veggie burger, which was made with beans and quite tasty. There were four sodas that were home brewed, which were root beer, cream soda, orange cream, and black cherry. The root beer was average, and the cream soda was great. We came with a big party of 12 in the evening, and the food still came in decent time.

BF and I went last Saturday night after we realized this place had opened. We have been watching the progress of the building in anticipation of trying their brews. BF had been previously but not me. The parking lot was jammed and we thought we were going to be in for a long wait...but to our surprise and delight, we were seated immediately since we were a table of two. That said, the table was rather tiny, but we made do. Despite the crowded restaurant, service was on the ball. Server came to take drink orders and since I couldn't decide (I am not much of a beer drinker), she offered to bring me a sample. Be aware, samples are only offered once in a 24 hour period. How they keep track of that...I did't ask. I ended up with a Brewhouse Blond and the BF had the Nit Wit. We both thought our selections were good, nearly top notch.  The appetizer we ordered was the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. These were very flavorful, shrimp were chargrilled. They laid on top of some veggies, mango salsa and a nice spicy/sweet sauce was provided for dipping. The miss with this appetizer is the lettuce used for the wraps. It is Boston lettuce, which is very tender (good), but too lightweight (bad) to hold the filling. We ate these with a fork and knife. Our entrees were served promptly. I had a new dish on the menu, the Creole Tilapia.  It is one of their enlightened entrees that is under 575 calories. It's served with rice pilaf...pretty standard...and some baby greens and veggies with a balsamic vinaigrette. The greens were completely limp...maybe due to a heatlamp? The Tilapia was covered with a nice tomato olive tapenade.Very tasty combo, just wish the lettuce would and have been crisp and chilled. BF had the Tuscan chicken limone which was served over angel hair pasta and included nice size pieces of artichoke, sundried tomato and steamed spinach. This was a huge portion and two crisp slices of garlic bread were served along side. He ate it all because it was so delish! Prices are very reasonable.

Yes, I am aware I'm giving this place a 4/5 stars.  I like this particular BJ's mostly because it reminds me of a similar family bar chain based out of Georgia called Taco Mac. I also like this place because of the bartender Joe.  Poor Joe has seen us in there a multitude of times and it kills me that he still has to follow the corporate ""script"" of up selling and whatnot. We know he has to. I worked my way through Chili's for goodness sakes and they'd send out secret shoppers to ensure we were even offering the Presidente Margarita to every effing lunch patron, otherwise we'd be written up.  But I digress.  I've always been there for lunch hours where their beers are on happy hour lunch prices. Joe has always been the bartender and he remembers us and knows my adoration for their Nutty Brewnette, which is a poor man's version of my favoritism beer on the plant, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. He is always accommodating and can suggest the yummiest foods.  Looking for something unique, opt for the bruschetta bites as a tasty palate driver before your meal. Their chicken tortilla soup is the jam with a fabulous presentation. They may go a bit overboard with the cheese, which, let's face it, I'm totally cool with.  I'm waiting to try some of their more gluttonous options, but I know Joe will always steer us in the right direction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2?start=80

Jacquelyn C.,"Austin, TX",79,26,1,1.0,4/10/2015,"Will not eat here again. Came on a friend's recommendation... the decor was kind of upscale looking but really mixed and ill fitting. The menu had way too many items on it: totally a bad sign. They got steak, pizza, pasta, fish, you name it... which means it's all crappy. I wasn't terribly hungry so I got some small plates/appetizers, their ""gourmet"" macaroni and avocado egg rolls. Both were unappetizing, greasy, and nearly flavorless. The beverages are too sweet. The pizza was mediocre. The deserts were a messy abuse of sugar and chocolate. The host refused to seat us at a booth, when there were three booths open the entire time we were there and never occupied. The waiter was new but nice, but because of this service was slow and spent the entire time with our menus on our table and didn't order dinner until after we finished our appetizers?  When I asked the waiter about what fruit was in ""seasonal fruit cobbler"", of course he didn't know. He went to his boss and asked, and came back and told me what ""seasonal fruit"" they had, which was melon, grapes, etc. I'm like... that's a weird cobbler? He checked again and it turns out it's always a mixed berry cobbler. There's so much stuff on this menu that they don't even know what they serve! This menu could be cut down by like 90% and they could focus on quality over quantity. Overall, for not that much food for four people and poor quality food at that, we walk out of there with some ridiculous $110+ tab.  We could've gone somewhere decent for that much money! I regret the decision to eat there so much. Long story short, this is McDonalds level with a cruddy facelift. I don't know where these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from at all.

Similar to TGIFridays, Chili's and Chotchkey's without all of the flair. Ha!  Burgers are alright as well as the other appetizers. The drinks I've had have made me think about better drinks I've had at other places. Whiskey sour - OK,  Margarita - Meh,  Light Ale - Meh, Old fashion adult spiked cherry soda - Blah...they use Pepsi. OK, I've been here 4 times now but only for drinks and snax / app's.

Sabryna S.,"Austin, TX",298,27,78,4.0,11/7/2017,"Great food! Good service!  To start, we were seated very quickly. The waiter was very attentive! Although, we did have a miscommunication. We were under the impression that the half off pizza special included all the pizzas, but it turns out it was only if you ordered a large. So in that sense there could have been more clarity when we were placing our orders because the small ended up being more expensive than if I got the large. But, it's all good.  The pizza was delicious!! It came fresh out of the oven with the perfect amount of pepperonis in place. If deep dish is your thing, BJ's is the place. It was also my friend's birthday so they brought out a mini pizooki for him. I had a few bites and it was the perfect finish to my meal. Warm, chocolately chip goodness all topped off with a scoop of creamy, vanilla ice cream. Yummmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2
Bill B.,"Houston, TX",0,18,2,3.0,10/8/2017,"This is a takeout review. Ordered two pizookies as part of the special $3 promo. Not sure if it's the promotion or that o requested take out, but wow the quality has gone down massively!  When I first saw the containers, I questioned the quantity since it looked much smaller. I even asked to make sure it wasn't a mini. I was assured it was a normal sized pizookie.  When I got home, I was disappointed. Since it was only $3 per pizookie, it didn't feel bad but I was upset since I was expecting something good. The cookie barely even filled up half of the plate, and I definitely didn't receive more than one scoop of ice cream. Maybe two small scoops.  Again, I think it was probably because I had takeout, and the special promo. They need to cut corners somewhere to still get some money at the end of the day. I get that, but just charge $5 per pizookie then, and give us what we expect.  Definitely disappointed, and probably will avoid coming here for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2

While the seasoning on the food are usually on the salty side for me, I still think they are pretty tasty. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the experiences I had this past week.  They sometimes have really good deal on the weekdays, but the waitress did not inform us the extra charge on some of sides while ordering the deal of the day, and of course I wasn't aware of it till I got the receipt. The other time I was charged extra for one of the sides. Kudos to the manager, the first time I called and complained about the issue, I was well taken care off immediately. Nevertheless, having to double check the receipt twice (and happened in the same week) was pretty annoying. We even joke about if we would go to our favorite scam restaurant for the dinner now.

Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",135,645,1576,4.0,8/3/2017,"Family took me here last night for dinner. I learned that BJ's is a western-state chain that originated in California. The big draw was that have their own beers.....so I was down for trying some new brews. The menu is extensive and it's pretty hard to choose! (Hey! That rhymed!) Lots of heavier fare that are calorie-laden but they also have lighter choices. I opted for the thin crust pizza with pineapple and jalapeño. The thin crust version is new to the menu and there are only a few choices - one was with bacon,ham, pineapple and jalapeño...I just asked to hold the meat on that one. Came out light, crispy, savory and a little sweet/tart/hot with the pineapple and jalapeño. We started by sharing the brussels sprouts - served crispy with a creamy sriracha sauce. Yum. My dining companions had the loaded burger and the chicken parmesan. Fries are really good. (I stole several). Dark beers all around - I had the bourbon barrel stout...delicious and strong. Nope...wasn't driving. Yep - had two. Almost forgot about the dessert! Maybe it's because I was in a beer/food-coma after this meal. We ordered 3 ""mini"" pizookies (get it? pizza and cookie makes a new word...): 1 monkey bread, one triple chocolate and one salted caramel. All were super sweet, decadent and....like I said...coma inducing. High calorie treat for sure but if you're going for it...go for it. They have ""regular"" sized pizookies as well.  The restaurant is clean, large, loud and the food was good. Would definitely go to BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2

Zach M.,"Austin, TX",0,141,,1.0,1/12/2018,"For lunch I had mediocre fish and chips (fries), a bowl of clam chowder, and a coke.  For a meal of mediocre quality and average quantity, my bill with tax and tip came to about $31.  I was shocked. I had not checked the prices because I had never had a lunch at the restaurant that seemed overpriced. My server consulted with the manager, who sent a message back to me that this was indeed what the meal would cost. Then, my server told me that prices had just gone up. This kind of price for very ordinary food, especially lunchtime, is ludicrous. For that kind of money, I can easily find well prepared food in a very high quality restaurant in Austin.  For this kind of price and very mediocre food, I can't see how this place can stay in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2

Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",45,164,1302,4.0,12/7/2016,"We have been to BJ's a few times.  This was our first visit to this location.  We fell in love with BJ's a while back because of the beer selections, happy hour, food, and customer service. This trip did not disappoint us at all.  We left happy and satisfied with our visit. For our drinks, my husband ordered a pint of the Grand Cru, a holiday Craft Beer.  He was not a big fan, but I loved it!  I ordered the the BJ's Irish Rootbeer, which includes hand crafted root beer, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Baileys Irish Cream, and Butterscotch schnapps.  This was absolutely delicious, the only change I would make is a bit more whiskey and schnapps.  I tasted everything else but these two ingredients and both should have been noticeable in the drink if the correct amount was added.  For our meal, my husband ordered the Derby-Style Chicken Cobb salad.  He absolutely adored it.  This is December, and the freshness and quality of the vegetables were amazingly on point. The avocado tasted of a freshly picked one from Summer time, no bruises on it at all.  He loved this salad and ate it all up. I ordered the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp entree.   I am normally not a huge tomato based food kind of fan - heartburn and all....but this dish was sooo delicious and fresh - I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The mahi mahi was super fresh and this fish is just like a steak of the seas- very meaty and hearty.  The flavors were so well blended. The shrimp was spot on delicious. The dish had a saltiness but not salty - more like a briney flavor that hits your taste buds and makes them tingle with happiness.  Of course I had to keep pushing my husbands fork away at his attempts to steal my food lol.  The only suggestion I would have is a few more shrimp, but it was the standard amount - especially for the price which was fairly decent considering the quality and quantity of the dish. Great customer service, excellent food, and fun drinks will always keep us coming back for more. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2

Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,668,,4.0,2/2/2017,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse gets no love in Austin. Some Yelpers hate it. The parking lot is deserted. In contrast, BJ's is THE place to be in College Station. The place is always packed. You park far away and walk in. The two establishments are near clones of each other - so the question is not good vs bad establishments in a chain. It is Austin vs Aggie World View. * On this particular question - I have to side with the Aggies. BJ's is a fine establishment. It is not perfect.  It is an eating establishment - and not a drinking establishment. Their homemade beers generally are awful.  (I recently ordered a Jeremiah Red, took two sips of it and sent it back to the bartender. Tasteless on first mouth contact - but with a bad aftertaste.  Talk about a bad combination of attributes.) Their selection of other beers and hard liquors is good but not magnificent. In Austin, which has the best funky bars of any city in a 1000 mile radius .... There are simply too many other awesome places near by for BJ's to be able to compete. In Bryan/College Station, BJ's stock runs higher from weaker competition. * But bar by bar comparisons miss the big picture here. BJ's has three gigantic points in its favor. 1) The room is beautiful. 2) The food is excellent. 3) For Chili's-style American places, BJ's has one of the healthiest menus around.  Good eye candy, good taste and a note from my doctor. With that combination, sign me up. * The room.  The architectural style is deliberately 1930's retro with better lighting.  This is particularly noticeable in the bathrooms - which are some of the best ever for a chain restaurant. But it applies throughout the establishment. Wainscoting. Frosted glass doors with old-style lettering. Brass accents. Walking in here feels like you are entering Sardi's or the Algonquin Hotel lunchroom. I am always happy when I arrive at a BJ's. * The food. BJ's runs a standard American chain bar and grill menu with more light items and more vegetables. You want quinoa? They got quinoa. They have many veggie sides and not just a few. They always have five or six different soups ranging from light and not caloric to loaded with the works.  And yeah -  they got burgers - lots of burgers - and wings and ribs and all the fun stuff we love, for when you need more than a portobello mushroom to keep you happy. Execution is excellent both on healthy stuff and fun stuff. I have been eating at BJ's (although not the Austin one) for years and have yet to get a bad dish. When I made my test run of the North Mopac BJ's, I intentionally ordered dishes I have had at the College Station BJ's. The preparation and final product were the same in both places - which meant I was quite happy with my food. * Now people have told me that they have had bad experiences at BJ's. Maybe there is a new manager now - and the old manager was terrible. Maybe I know too many fussy eaters -  although I doubt that since I hang with the most magnificent people in the universe. But the BJ's on North Mopac seems perfectly fine. For my money, BJ's is at the top of the chain American bar-and-grill establishment - and is still respectable when you add indie bar and grills into the comparison pool. Yeah, it is not better than the best of the best -  but it is as good if not better than much of the pack. Just don't drink their homemade beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-austin-2

The restaurant is very cute and clean, has a nice casual ambiance, good friendly and attentive service, and pretty delicious food and great beer. I had a blonde ale and my boyfriend got a flight with 4 beer samples, their prices for beer were VERY reasonable too, mine was only $4!! We were starving so we started with 2 apps, BBQ boneless wings and the fried artichokes. The BBQ sauce was delicious and the wings were really good, plus we got a LOT for the price. The artichokes were my favorite though, very good and different. For my entree I had Mediterranean chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the bison burger. He loved his burger and my tacos were amazing, I also loved the side grain salad that came with it!! Everything tasted very good and fresh, also the portions were good for the prices.

Too big, really.  I was trying to decide between a burger, pasta, pizza or a steak.  Everything looked delicious.   They were out of the pumpkin beer, so my husband tried the Hopstorm IPA.  He also tried the Piranha IPA.  The Piranha was much better, much more hoppy. Their peach margarita was good.  The glass was full of ice which is why I probably don't drink much when we go out - I always feel I'm not getting my money's worth.  I loved the flavor and the peaches at the bottom of the glass but I should remember to stick to blended drinks.  I switched to a mug of their BJ's Root Beer and that was excellent. Frosty, cold mug...yum.  I'd buy that to bring home if I could.   The hickory brisket and bacon burger was excellent. I would have loved more brisket, but there was plenty of bacon and the BBQ sauce was really good.  The wedge fries were good, too. My husband enjoyed his vegetable penne.
