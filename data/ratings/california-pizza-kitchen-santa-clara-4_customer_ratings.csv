Service is on point...  Friendly, Fast and Fun.  Food ain't so bad either as I love me some Kung Pao Spaghetti. Typically restaurants that open new locations struggle with their personnel and execution.  However, CPK Santa Clara has ""nailed it"" and we just had to personally compliment their GM and Manager this evening for a job well done.

106,Stephanie S.,"Kihei, United States",5,3,,4.0,2017-02-07,"Traveling thru and decided on this new location of CPK.  As always the food was good. My shrimp scampi zucchini dish could have used a bit more flavor and the zucchini made the dish a little watery but it was a wonderfully portioned size and of course good enough to finish almost the whole dish.  I'd give the place five stars but there was visible dust above our table along with some left over food particles of just not a thoroughly cleaned table and some flickering lights that if I had a seizure disorder I would of been having some trouble.  Our server Jen, I can't say enough good things about her. She was upbeat,  attentive, easy to joke around with and made us feel taken care of. She gets 5 stars on her own. Great job Jen!!

Ordered the Cobb salad and 1 pizza. pizza was fine no problems .  My Cobb salad disappointed me , there was no avocado as advertised and were talking a $15 salad here so I expected a good salad , it was a pretty pathetic salad ... your able to add so many things to the salad so I added some carne asada , $5 extra .... this salad is over $20 now ,,, they didn't even give me the carne asada I ordered ... no avocado no extra meat I ordered ... needless to say I will not be ordering food from them again , I won't  go there again period. If you use a service like grubhub to get your food to people you are still expected to give people the food they order that you offer.

125,Rob B.,"Cupertino, United States",0,3,,1.0,2017-03-09,"We love CPK and were excited for this new location to open. Giant place, but pretty empty tonight. Hostess sat us next to two tables with two different servers.  In 15 minutes they visited each table 2-3 times. But still no one came to take our order, despite making eye contact. Tried to flag down the hostess when she seated another customer - but she also didn't see us. Either my family discovered new invisibility powers or the service here is abysmal.  Mentioned the 15 minute wait to the hostess as we left hungry.  ""Oh I'm sorry"" and went about her business.  I understand waits happen when a place is busy, but I've never been so actively ignored.  Anyhow, highly recommend the Stanford shopping mall CPK (excellent service) or even Westgate.  Worth the drive to avoid whatever this was tonight.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40,3.7159999999999997,3.7159999999999997,3.7159999999999997,3.7159999999999997,3.7159999999999997

67,Meghan N.,"San Jose, CA",11,167,40.0,3.0,2017-05-08,"Was excited to try the new location because the only other location that is closest to my place is attached to the mall so parking can be a nightmare. The restaurant itself is really pretty and open. I liked the bar area but there wasn't room for our party of 3. We sat a high top in the bar area. Most of the other CPK's bar area's are overlooking the pizza oven so it was disappointing that wasn't the case at this location. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start and our entrees. The entrees came out and as soon as the waitress set them down she spilled my husband's entire soda all over the table, spilling out and over into the booth and partly on my pants. She barely apologized and we had to ask her to get a rag. Not only that but instead of rushing to fix the mistake she slowly walked over to get a rag like she didn't really care to fix the problem. Totally put a damper on the rest of the dining experience. I actually had to get up from the booth to get more napkins because the area was still soaked. Not only that but we were still eating our appetizer before she spilled the soda everywhere and she took it away without asking. The only time she apologized was when she was giving us the check. I would come back but if that same girl was our server I would request a new one because the way she handled the situation was horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40,4.72,4.72,4.72,2.7,4.72

I thought it was going to be worst because she said it was busy and there was a handful of groups ahead of us. Regardless, we got stay down in 5 minutes so it was exceptional. We sat down and ordered two pizzas. The roasted artichoke + spinach and margherita pizza off the thin crust section. We waited about less than 10 minutes for our pizzas and the waitress apologized for how long it took. Gosh I was thinking these workers sure have high standards for quality. Before the pizzas arrived, the waitress got us our waters and sourdough bread slices with olive oil with a couple of minutes. Pizza came out and the first one I dug into was the roasted artichoke + spinach and thought the toppings were kind of dry. I also noticed the cheese wasn't as warm and looked as if it was resting for a bit before we got served. 2/5 for the roasted artichoke + spinach pizza. However the margherita pizza was pretty good. The freshly diced tomatoes near the crust was very refreshing. The only downside was that the cheese wasn't as warm as I would have liked and the topping wasn't spread out evenly all round the pizza. 3/5 for the margherita pizza. So I can understand why the waitresses apologized for the long wait as our pizza was probably resting for awhile after it got out of the oven. Given that, the pizzas were just okay to me. I'm sure it may have been better if we got straight from the oven.   SERVICE: Outstanding, I've read several reviews about poor service but I have had no issues here.

The restaurant itself is really pretty and open. I liked the bar area but there wasn't room for our party of 3. We sat a high top in the bar area. Most of the other CPK's bar area's are overlooking the pizza oven so it was disappointing that wasn't the case at this location. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start and our entrees. The entrees came out and as soon as the waitress set them down she spilled my husband's entire soda all over the table, spilling out and over into the booth and partly on my pants. She barely apologized and we had to ask her to get a rag. Not only that but instead of rushing to fix the mistake she slowly walked over to get a rag like she didn't really care to fix the problem. Totally put a damper on the rest of the dining experience. I actually had to get up from the booth to get more napkins because the area was still soaked. Not only that but we were still eating our appetizer before she spilled the soda everywhere and she took it away without asking. The only time she apologized was when she was giving us the check.
