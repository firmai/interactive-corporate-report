0,Mike K.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,9,,4.0,2016-09-19,"We was in SLC yesterday for a family thing and wanted to eat on the way home. We stopped at the Cheesecake factory, (it was open on Sunday, a Utah thing). I had the Salmon with a Lemon Sauce, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes. First I thought, mashed potatoes with salmon? should be rice, but I just went with it. There was a nice sear on the salmon, tender and moist. The asparagus was cooked great, nice and crisp and the well seasoned mashed potatoes where just right. then the lemon sauce tied it all together. My only complaint was the sauce should be lime, (just my preference) not lemon and needed more of it. The wait was about 10 minutes and the staff was good, over all very nice. And of coarse you can't go wrong with the cheese cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-3,,,,,
