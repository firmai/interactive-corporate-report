306,Myrna J.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,99,10.0,4.0,2012-01-11,"I've been coming here since they opened. I absolutely love their food. Menu has changed but you can ask for certain things that don't appear on the menu and chances are you'll get it.  Service is good sometimes. I guess it depends on the day and time. Sometimes your food comes quick other times it might get lost but you'll eventually get it.  I have never really ordered drinks here until I came with my boyfriend. We decided to hit the bar because the wait was long. First of all, there was no bartender for awhile but we can see him. He just ignored us for a LONG time. When he finally took our order which were two long islands, he prepared them rather quickly. Pro??? Nope, our long islands tasted like lemonade with a twist of ""WTF is this!?!"" As soon as he gave us our drinks he vanished. We couldn't or better didn't get the chance to bring the taste of our long islands to his attention.  When we were finally seated we asked the host where the bartender was to pay for our drinks but he said it would go on our tab. Okay....waitress was nice. We ordered, our food came, we ate....waitress brought our check. As soon as she brought our check she too vanished. Our drinks weren't on their....we didn't even get the chance to tell her because we were rushed out. So if you want free long islands, virgin long islands that is by all means hit this place up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=300,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.6079999999999997,2.44

329,c k.,"Tujunga, CA",1,24,,1.0,2012-03-02,"Wow! My first one star review! Okay, so the food was pretty bad, but the service was the inexcusable part. I ordered an iced tea and a beer. Both of my drinks were handed to a random person at my table, and they in turn had to hand them to me. With neither beverage was I ever offered a re-fill. I ordered a plate of nachos and specifically said they would be my entree and I wanted them at the same time as everyone got their meal, the waiter served them as if they were ""for the table"" and handed to someone across from me before anyone else's food came.  Food was pretty bad compared to other Red Robins (and nearby restaurants). Paying was similar, all of us had to walk over to where all the waiters were (as they were standing in a circle talking), and we had to repeatedly explain to our waiter who had what so he could separate our bill. Afterward we put attached our cards to our bills and handed them to him. We had to watch over him as he swiped each card, and he then randomly handed cards back to the wrong people.  Generally the food was bad, and the waitstaff were offensively apathetic and neglectful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=320,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.372,2.4

ITS ALWAYS THE RUM!  well in this case the fries but if youve seen pirates of the caribbean youd understand anyway, the fries were soggy, over salted, and kinda gross...lets just say i didnt order a second basket, let alone finish my first serving then our original waiter comes back for the checks for a $10 bill i left about $1.50 in tip, just doubling the tax probably wont return for a long time, and if i do will be during non busy hours",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=300,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.472,2.32

The food was great as well.  Our family of three had Fried Mushrooms, Cheese Sticks, Towering Onion Rings, Clucks and Fries, Southwest Chicken Pasta, Potato Soup and the Kid's Peperoni Pizza with Side Salad.

347,Valerie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,230,25.0,1.0,2012-04-17,"Saw red robin by chance as we looked for parking. We normally wouldn't eat here, but we were hungry and went to the mall to take our son to meet some Disney characters. As we walked in from the lot, the place was bright and bigger than I imagined. Not too packed since it was around 4. Our male server was very nice and took our order. We got our drinks and appetizer fairly quickly ( half jalapeno coins and half cheese sticks) The jalapeno coins tasted like del tacos but pricier. He even refilled our drinks. Then as we got our dinner, he introduced us to a new waitress since his shift was over. Not once did we see our new server. My husbands drink was empty again and we didn't see anyone working to even ask about our server.  Finally my husband got a different servers attention for a refill. Getting the check was another long wait. But I did notice by the bar about 3 of them were talking and didn't look busy. The table next to us waited about 15-20min just for someone to take their drink order, then waited about 5 min and just walked out!! ( we seriously thought about it too since we couldn't find anyone to ring us up!!) One guy had to have his daughter approach a guy with a MOP for some napkins! And the booth behind us asked that same guy to order and inquired about their server and he said he was looking for one. Anyway, we won't be coming back. And i'm not sure those other 4 tables will either. The food was ok, what you would expect from here. I got fish and chips, but the fries tasted old, like it's been sitting there and not hot and had no salt. They have seasoning at the table, but usually fries at least have some flavor. It's free refills on fries but no thanks. My husband got a burger which was ok.

Service was HORRIBLE!!! The icing on the cake for me was when he asked if we wanted more water.  The waiter took our glasses to refill them.  When he brought them back he used the old glasses.  When he brought them back he handed my friend my glass.  I only noticed it because I asked for a water with lemon, and I ate my lemon.  Most places either bring a picture of water and fill right there at the table, or bring new glasses of water, and take the empty as they put the new down.   We ordered appetizers.  It was taking forever for those to arrive so I asked him what was taking them so long.  He came back to the table and explained that there was some mix up in the kitchen.  (I don't buy any mix up.. clearly this kids forgot to put our order in.)   When he did finally bring us our appetizers he sat them on the table.. No forks, plates, napkins.. nothing. It was at that point I had enough. I tracked down the manager. She took him off our table.  I will say Cody was a better waiter and kept checking on us..(that is why I gave it two stars.) The manager was VERY kind too.. I gave this one start only because this is the worst flu season in a very long time.  She can't have a waiter like that mixing up glasses.  Not to mention it is just gross.. I live in Northridge.. never had issues like the ones I had tonight. I will NEVER be back to the Valencia Red Robin.. I wish I checked the Yelp reviews BEFORE I went..

As you can imagine, I'm talking about Red Robin in the Valencia mall. We had to stop in and give it a try, seeing as the last time I'd visited one was years ago in the Palmdale mall.  I would like to say that I had the best server that I've had in a very long time. Alan and company took care of us without having to mention that our water was empty, etc.  If the food matched the customer service, this place would really have something. I'm not saying the food was terrible. It just wasn't amazing, or even something worth mentioning. We got the bagle bites with the beer cheese and mustard sauces. The beer tasted kind of ruined the cheese, and horse radish was a little too strong in the mustard. We shared a turkey club, which wasn't exemplary, but good. My biggest issue with it, was that the turkey itself tasted like they got it out of the lunch meat isle from a local grocery store. The bottomless fries tasted like the same.  The quality seemed mass produced, and of a lower standard than their competitors in the area. The price was right and the service was exemplary.

277,Jenny J.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",45,69,13.0,3.0,2013-05-10,"I went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was fairly empty. I usually love going to Red Robins for some burgers and fries so my friends and I decided to go there for lunch. We got seated right away and our server was very friendly.  we got onion rings to start us off and they were delicious, crispy just how I like em :) I got the Red Robin Royal burger and I split this with my boyfriend. It was more than enough since we had onion rings and bottomless garlic fries. Before, Red Robin used to have free garlic fries but now they charge a dollar for them.... and they charge over a dollar for sweet potato fries! I mean I say that they're worth it but our garlic fries barely had any garlic on them and it was just basically regular fries sprinkled with really little cheese and almost no garlic.  The server suggested spicy ketchup and she said she really likes it but when I tried it it wasn't even spicy and it just tasted like ketchup. Also, my friend ordered a monster size of their shakes and BEWARE. It's 5 dollars and you get the normal shake in the cup and you get the extra cup of the leftovers from when they made it but it's not a lot. This is what normal diners do when you order a shake but Red Robin calls it a ""monster"" shake ..... uhhh I don't think so..

Parking is only as easy as to how busy the mall will be. Restaurant was pretty empty, which means fast service. Overall though, majorly disappointed.  Somehow got talked into getting a monster shake (friend mistakenly thought it was unlimited) which taste-wise, wasn't too bad, but nothing spectacular. But at almost $5 for the shake and extra tin it comes in, not worth it at all since it's just regular sized (even a little small compared to other places). I'd rather buy $5 of ice cream and make my own shake. Ordered the prime chophouse burger that comes with mushrooms, onion strings served on an onion bun for $10. MEHH, not that great, at that price, it was like a 4/10. Got the unlimited sweet potato fries for like an extra $1.50, they were actually pretty decent but I think the garlic fries that my other friends ordered was much better. I like that it's unlimited fries but you can really only eat at max 2 orders since it's so starchy and potato-ey that you get super full super fast. Our server was nice and friendly enough, checking in on us a couple of times. Overall experience though was probably right on the dot of Yelp's 2 star review ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The prices are a little too high for the quality and quantity of food you get (I guess except the unlimited fries).

The hostess seem to be in a hurry for everything. The silverware was not washed or was not washed property as we can see stains from the last use. I got the Clucks and Shrimp entree. It was just gross and tasted horrible. It felt like they just microwaved frozen breaded shrimp and chicken. I ate a few shrimps and left everything else for trashing. The entire dish was loaded with oil and grease and what not. The coleslaw was okay but only has 2 spoonful. I just couldn't stomach anything after that. We had onion rings which I tried a few pieces. I would avoid Red Robin anytime in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=320,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.6320000000000006,2.92

Instead of having burgers from fast food place. Why not have a Gourmet Burger?! A Gourmet Burger from Red Robin. You'll be able to find Red Robin at the northeast section of Westfield Valencia closer to the Citrus St. entrance. Red Robin is connected to the mall, but I cannot tell you which stores are located next door. My co-worker and I were greeted and seated at one of the booths near the parking lot. There is another dining area that you will be seated at if you enter from the mall.  Our server was Desiree, a hot, blue-eyed, tattooed waitress. My buddy ordered Iced Tea and I got a lemonade ($2.79 each). He was all set for a juicy burger. I cannot recall if he did order the Red Robin Burger ($8.99) with Onion Rings (+$1.49) or just ordered something else. My receipt says Chz BG. It could mean, Cheese Big Guy! I ordered a familiar meal, Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap ($9.99) with Red Robin's Bottomless Fries. Desiree made sure our drinks were filled while we waited for our meals. I was very surprised that there was a lunch crowd from people taking their breaks. I would have thought that this location would get a crowd after the work shift ends. More and more people started to walk in, but our food just came in right in time. My co-worker loved his burger and his well-done onion rings. As for me, I always love enjoying my Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap. However, I could not finish my first order of fries. Thus, it could not be bottomless fries. My buddy was able to finish his meal, but I was ashamed that I could not. He loved his well-done onion rings and I wish I had changed my fries and gave him my onion-rings. Double-birthday gift for him. It was good meal, but I swear my stomach did shrink. Ultimately, my co-worker enjoyed his meal and his meal was well deserved. Desiree did her job and I almost thought I needed to do a tat job. Now, I need to find another Red Robin to invade. Do you think I write too much?

The lady who sat us asked if table and chairs were ok.  Sure, i don't need to sit in a booth.  She seats us in a table that was literally right on top of the service area.  Really??  I had my back to it and didn't notice when we sat down 'til all the servers were huddling around.  Now, the place had maybe 10 tables seated, why seat us on top of the service area??  It was very uncomfortable. I can't imagine there was a manager there at the time 'cuz everyone was goofing around, walking around, bringing in Starbucks and parading it all through out the restaurant.  Talk about unprofessional!!  Starbucks is for your break, not for your job!! Then our server took our order, brought our drinks and then disappeared.  I'm watching the counter and see what i know must be our food and it's just sitting there.  Seriously, 10 minutes.  Just sitting there.  Another server picked up the dishes and put them on a serving tray and then our server finally showed up and delivered it.  My son ordered mandarin oranges and got fries on the side, but she did bring oranges to him as well, so ok.   Naturally, my sandwich was cold and so were the fries.  I waited for her to come back to ask ""how is everything"" or at least check on us.  Never happened.  She even approached the table, looked at us, froze and said out loud ""what was i doing??  oh yeah."" and walked right past us.  Really??  Walked right past us as if she weren't even serving our table.  Didn't even ask if we wanted more fries!!  Nothing!! After i choked down my cold food and the kids were done, she came over to our table, put down the check and said ""i'll take that when you're ready.""  Not, how was the food, thanks for coming...just give me your money and get out.  Which i did.  I normally don't leave anything less than $5 for a tip, no matter what the tab is.  She got $3 and i was being very generous...lucky for her i didn't want to wait for my change, which could've been another 10-15 minutes coming.  I couldn't wait to get out and get gone and not sure we'll return.  I've always been a ""Red Robin...YUM"" kinda gal, but that may well have been the straw that broke the camels back.

It took forever for our order to come out and there were basically no patrons in the place. The quality and preparation of the food is abysmal.  Word to management and line cooks: Ensure when food is brought out, it does not sit around for 10 minutes til the other dishes for that table are prepared. You have to know what the preparation time for each dish is.  My food was so cold that, I asked my waitress to heat it up again. The sad part is that I don't think they truly care if they give you cold fries vs hot fries. More like a 'whatever' kind of an attitude.    For the grief and money spent,  In-N-Out schools this establishment many times.

I always order the crispy chicken burger with no onions or tomatoes and add cheese. They always get it right, although some of the chefs cook the chicken a tad much. Depending on the time of night if it's close to closing the fries can be a little cold but they are willing to fix it if you mention it.  Also, just want to say that I'm updating my review from 3 to 4 stars since the last time we have been here. Last time my bf ordered a Irish car bomb and the girl was new to bar tending and made us something completely different. After reading the review she realized what happened and remembered us on our next visit. She made us a new one the right way this visit on the house which she didn't have to do and it was very kind of her. Going to leave the price of one plus what we were normally going to give her as a tip. Great to know they pay attention to their reviews and use them to improve. :)  My bf gets different burgers and most of the time it turns out ok but if it's way busy things can sometimes get added or left out but they always fix it. We come here because when the food is good it's really good and we love all of the servers we have had especially Toby. He's always polite and super friendly.

296,Joseph N.,"Canyon Country, CA",75,11,9.0,1.0,2015-05-01,"As I used to frequent this location quite often, I figured why not hit it up for a quick lunch with my coworkers.  Unfortunately, it seems they have gone downhill quite a bit.  The first thing I should have noticed was that it was pretty empty for a Friday lunch hour.  Being that my coworkers and I were engaged in conversation, I wasn't really paying attention to the fact it was nearly empty.  We were approached fairly quickly by the bartender (we were seated in the bar area for some reason) and we asked for 3 waters while we looked over the menu.  About a minute after we got our water one of my coworkers told me ""you better order a drink because this tastes like tap water"".  He was dead-on.  I couldn't even drink the water even though it had lemon in it.  Still, we pushed ahead (I mean we do have a water crisis in CA right? maybe they're cutting cost..) then I realized everything on the menu had jumped significantly in price since the last time I had been there.  Burgers now ranged from $11-$15.  OK, I thought, maybe the quality is better than I remember.  I definitely don't recall them being super-gourmet or anything, but they were decent, so let's see.  My two coworkers ordered the BBQ Chicken Wraps and I ordered one of their newer burgers (Some Ghost-Pepper/Jalapeno burger I forget the name).  After about 15 minutes the food came, and the first thing I noticed was that my burger wasn't even warm.  It was as if the patty's were sitting in a prep-tray and just slapped on the buns without any heating involved.  Then I checked the fries - yep.  Not even warm.  At this point I'm fairly disappointed. Due to the fact we were on lunch, I wasn't about to wait another 15 minutes for a new burger, but I figured I'd let them know how disappointed I was.  After the waitress (bartender) came back to ask how our food was, I explained to her the situation, and she said, let me get ""him"" (I assume she meant the manager?) and your check and I'll be right back.  We sat there for another 10 minutes waiting, nothing.  Here we are on the tail end of our lunch hour and as she walks by again she says ""he's coming in a second"".  Another 5 minutes goes by, and I see a lady named Tara approaching.  Not sure why since the bartender kept making reference to ""him"" and ""he's coming"".  So Tara approaches and starts telling us she's ""one of the managers"" there, and she's really sorry about the food.  I explained to her we've been waiting nearly 15 minutes for someone to come over here, and we need our checks as we're going to be late getting back to work.  ""Sorry, I was on a phone call"" was the response she gave me.  Super irritated at this point, obviously we were no concern to anyone at Red Robin despite expressing our dissatisfaction already.  At this point I'm wondering if the ""him"" the bartender kept referring to didn't feel like dealing with a dissatisfied customer so he sent Tara over..?  At any rate, Tara returns a few minutes later and said she gave us the ""family discount"" on all our bills (which was $2.12 off my $16 check) and said to us ""I'm always here, next time you come I promise we'll do better""... uh.. what?  So she needs to be there next time for them to do better?  Offered nothing else to us, and was clearly irritated with the entire situation.  Probably wanted to get back on her ""phone call"".  All said and done, all three of us agreed we'll never return to this Red Robin.  Total waste of time and money.  Obviously not too concerned with their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=280,3.12,2.75,2.75,2.052,2.8980000000000006

I've been in the restaurant biz all my life so I'm pretty sympathetic and generous when tipping...never leaving less than 20% sometimes more. I can overlook a few mistakes in service but I had a completely bad experience. I came in by myself. I waited at the host stand for a few minutes and no one acknowledged me. I finally started walking to a table to seat myself and that's when they noticed me. I asked for a table on the patio that sticks out in the mall walkway. I sat down. Someone did come by to explain how the automated iPad thingy on the table works. I told them I didn't want to interact with the iPad thingy since I'm on a computer all day long. I wanted a server. (By the way...the self ordering is going to be restaurants answer to $15 per hour wage...get used to it). I waited and waited for someone to come all the while sitting around 5 dirty tables that had not been cleared. Yuck. Those tables should be cleared immediately since everyone walking by in the mall can see the dirty tables. I finally raised my arm and started waving my hand. A server came and took my order. He then brought my iced tea and waited for my burger...still sitting amongst the dirty tables. When my burger arrived it was dropped off so fast I didn't have time to ask for a knife. I waited some more before I flagged another down for a knife to cut my burger in half so I could eat it. The knife finally arrived as my burger was now cooling. My fries were cold and had to flag down another to get my fries replaced for hot ones. No one ever came to ask me if everything was okay or refill my tea. I finished my burger still sitting at a table surrounded by dirty dishes. The burger was just okay. The fries were good after they replaced them with fresh hot ones. No one asked me if I wanted anything else. Sell, sell, sell servers. It increases the check amount. I asked for my check and left just 10%. I didn't even want to leave that but like I said...I'm in the biz. I so wanted to take the servers aside and teach them how to increase their tips to 15% and 20% every single time. In the restaurant business it's all about the service. Anyone can get food anywhere. People don't have to tip but if you give them good service and you make their experience a good one, it's like putting your hand in their pocket and taking the money out. They will come back or not come back because of the way you made them feel. Especially pay attention to single people.

I was amazed with our server.  She was running the tables in the bar area and making drinks for the rest of the restaurant.  She was fun to watch, she never made an extra motion, something happened every time she moved.

65,Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,980,3113.0,3.0,2015-09-16,"It was a Tuesday, and it was just about one o'clock in the afternoon. I was at the mall waiting for my new eyeglasses to be ready upstairs at Lenscrafters. I had seen all the cute animals at the shelter-pet store, and I still had to kill about an hour.  Since I hadn't eaten anything thus far in the day, I was pretty hungry.     I was lured to Red Robin by the wondrous photos of burgers on the signs advertising the restaurant. They enticed me to step closer to them, and eventually step just a bit further and enter the establishment to ask for a table. I was quickly greeted, and ushed to a seat.     Waitress came by quickly. Since I was one of a small handful of people in the place, she was quite attentive.        For the past few days, I'd been hankering for a big fat burger, and when I saw the table tent advertising the Uberbuger, I was fairly easily swayed into a decision. Uberburger appeared to have some kinda weird bun, a sausage, and some grilled vegetables all atop a big fat cheeseburger. Long story short, I ordered the burger and was informed that it came with bottomless fries. From my understanding, all Red Robin burgers come standard with bottomless fries. So I ordered, and waitress shot off to give the order to the cooks, and quickly came back to refill my iced tea.       Before too long, a large big fat burger was placed before me. The fries were in a shiny metal cup next to the burger. The burger was ok. But it was definitely a large and messy thing. The pretzel bun ended up falling apart long before I was done with the burger. But overall, the burger was decent. The fries were also pretty tasty. Waitress had given me a tub of ranch dressing to dunk the seasoned fries in.     As I ate, waitress came back often to refill my iced tea, and to also inquire about a fry refill after I had finished the fries given to me. I was already quite stuffed with the burger and the fries I had already eaten. Any more and they'd have a cleanup to deal with.  However, I do like the idea of bottomless fries. I wonder if you could just spend an afternoon at the mall peoplewatching and eating french fries? I'll have to ask about that on the next trip.    After visiting the restroom to wash my hands of the grease and burger gunk, I took care of my bill on the electronic doohickey at the table, and then left to pick up my new glasses. Total was twenty-five(ish) with tax and tip. A tad on the pricey side, but the burger was big and bottomless fries.      I'm not at the mall all that often, but when I visit next, I think I'll stop in here at Red Robin for endless fries....and maybe a big fat burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=80,2.36,2.77,2.77,2.636,2.606

My aunt ordered a orange creme soda and was disappointed but drank it anyways to not waste it. I ordered some expensive strawberry lemonade the waiter suggested, but it wasn't worth the price I paid.

292,Andrew T.,"Canyon Country, CA",9,4,2.0,2.0,2015-11-29,"My girlfriend and I Just left this restaurant without eating. Waited 10 min to be seated which is perfectly reasonable. I understand being busy. Our host Dillan was really friendly and kind. Best part about the evening. He seated us at a booth in the bar and told us our server would be right with us. There were three people running around and none of them were any servers we had seen before and we come here a lot. They must be seasonal. We waited around 15 minutes for someone to come by and introduce them selves and take our drink order but nobody showed. We thought that perhaps they were too busy so we would try to order our drinks on the ziosk to save them time. While trying to find the soda option to order my finger accidentally hit the call server button. It turned on a flashing red light and canceled the option to let me order drinks. At first we felt bad because I never liked the idea of summoning our server electronically but we figured at least someone would show up and we could get drinks and have them put in our order. After a few minutes of servers walking by and nobody stopping I wondered if none of them were our server. After a few more minutes I started to get annoyed because even if they weren't they could have let our server know we needed assistance. A few minutes after that we had been sitting there for almost half an hour and nobody had stopped or even acknowledged us. That's when we decided to just find another restaurant. As we got up to leave a woman came over and was grabbing plates at a table one or two next to us. She just looked at us and didn't say anything even as we grabbed our stuff to leave. We have been coming here for a long time and have always felt appreciated but tonight we felt like our servers couldn't have cared less.

230,Mike P.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,16,,1.0,2016-03-11,"Stay away unless you like unsanitary conditions, waiting for your food, and rude servers. I came here on 3/8/9 around 4:30 with my family for my 8 year-old daughter's birthday dinner (3 adults and 3 kids). Here were the major issues: 1) When the server brought us our drinks, he was holding one of the glasses with his fingers wrapped all around the rim of the glass--the part you press your lips against when drinking. That grossed my mother in law out to the point that she politely told the server he should never do that. She later felt bad about saying anything about it and apologized to the guy, but I think she was right to say something, since nobody wants to kiss the palm of a guy they've never met. 2) Though the restaurant was fairly slow/empty and had at least 3 servers working, it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food. We ordered 2 burgers, a bowl of soup, and 3 kid meals--with no modifications--so there was nothing overly complicated going on with our order. 3) When we first got there, a nearby table of 4 was having a birthday celebration and got the regular restaurant singing-by-the-servers-thing. My 8 year old daughter's eyes lit up and asked if they would do the same for her if our server knew it was her birthday. I said they might. I told the server it was her birthday, and he acknowledged me. Now, pretty much every restaurant I know of will bring you a scoop of vanilla ice cream along with the song to help a patron celebrate--that's all I was hoping for. I would have paid them to do that for my daughter. But...nothing. The check came, I paid, and he stopped by one last time to ask if there was anything else. Thanks, Red Robin--you'll never see us again. So if you like licking server's dirty palms with every sip you take, enjoy waiting inordinately long times for meals while your kids circle the drain, and like having your daughter's birthday summarily ignored--come here!

If I make a gourmet burger I use 75% lean which is the fattest ground beef you can get.  When I am done eating my homemade burger I feel great.  I walked out of red robin feeling like I drank a large glass of deep frier grease.  The burger was just dripping grease.   The bottom bun was completely saturated with grease.  Not acceptable for a place that is new and specializes in gourmet burgers.   Food.  2 stars Service 2 stars Atmosphere 4 stars I will not be returning.   Too many good to great options to eat around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=80,1.92,2.53,2.53,1.736,2.286

The fish and chips were very well done with flaky, moist white fish under a nearly greaseless fried batter. The side order of equally greaseless sweet potato fries was delicious and enough to feed a table of 3 even though it was under $5 I believe. I expected the worst based on the reviews here but our waitress was friendly and attentive, the wait not too bad, and the diner style food was really good.  Until this visit, the reason why I stopped easting at places like Red Robin is due to cleanliness issues. Many places like this usually look clean, but if you grab the plastic menu standing at the table or reach a condiment, your fingers usually run over some sort of greasy film unseen yet felt. That kind of thing turns me off right away. This was NOT the case at this Red Robin and I only hope that that is not because it is new.

For some odd reason he's been wanting to try this place ever since it opened. Now I can this was his first and last time here. When we entered on a Monday afternoon, the entrance was full of families waiting to be seated. The hostess told us it would be a 30min wait, and so we sat closest to her so we can hear our name. After some time had passed, we noticed that families that came in after we did were being seated before us. We went up to the hostess that took over that shift and they said we weren't on the wait list anymore, and that our name was somehow removed. We voiced how upset we were and they seated us right away. As another hostess sat us, we asked her for a child's menu since they forgot to bring one for my son but she never brought one. Our regular waiter came and we had to ask him for it. Food: Over priced for such poor quality. The bottom of my burger bun was soaked with oil. My son ordered the kids cupcake shake because the picture in the menu looked so delicious, but when it came it wasn't even filled to the top. The top was mostly whip cream and sprinkles.  The worst part is that our son mentioned to the waiter that it was his birthday, but they never came to sing to him. They did sing to the other table next to us though. This place is horrible.

I did return for another lunch, as I thought it might have been an anomaly and surely they could make good burgers. The Blue Cheese burger took 30 minutes, and they failed to cook it medium rare as i requested-- it was medium. The waiter said that they only make burgers ""slightly pink"" or ""not pink."" Worse, the meat had an odd texture, like they had ground it too finely; that is, it had no texture at all! It was a rather gross homogeneous mass. Furthermore, my blue cheese burger had no blue cheese on it; I had to ask the waiter to bring some. The onion rings and the milk shake were good, though.  But how can it be a ""gourmet burger"" if they don't cook it to order? Maybe their kitchens are run by lawyers instead of cooks. Lots of small children present at lunch.

I have now made multiple visits to the new location, and have been disappointed on each occasion.  I can deal with the wait time, as it is a new location and people are excited to visit, my only recommendation  here would be to offer a ""call ahead"" seating type option, or an option where you could put yourself on the waiting/guest list through the use of an app on smartphone or tablet.  The challenge starts when you are initially seated.  It takes quite a while to receive any attention and although there is an ability to order items on the table top device, you can't use it until you place an initial order through one of the servers at which time it becomes activated.  I don't blame the servers for the exuberant wait times on receiving service, which also leads into wait times on receiving drinks/food/refills etc.  it seems that the restaurant is completely understaffed, not to the fault of any of the front line employees, and I would even go as far to say the management of the particular establishment/. I am assuming this issue is created from a budgetary standpoint or someone who received a bonus off of the P&L, or some type of employee productivity measure.  This is unfortunate as in the long term it will be extremely difficult to keep both guests happy and retain quality employees, once the nostalgia of a ""new place"" wears off.  It is imperative to provide guests with not only a quality product, but quality service, which in all actuality can make a far bigger impact than the product being offered.  My ask is that whoever may make decisions look at the long term outlook, and asses the opportunity to staff the restaurant properly to provide a better guest experience. The food is what you would expect, although the kitchen gets extremely backed up and I have had to send items back each time for coming out cold, once again I don't blame the front line, this will happen when there aren't enough servers, expediters, food runners, etc.!  The same goes for beverage service, it takes an extremely long time to obtain a refill on any type of beverage, and even longer for an alcoholic beverage.  The appearance of the new restaurant is far more in line with a modern environment than the previous restaurant located at the Town Center Mall.  The issue I have here is that it is not properly maintained.  The menus, and table tops are sticky, the floor is not well swept/mopped, even the window sills have a layer of dust.  I know it gets busy, but once again, this can have an effect on long term success/failure of a business, and can easily be addressed. This review is not meant to bash the establishment.  I am more than happy to share further feedback with someone who may be interested in hearing it.  Please feel free to reach out to me.  I hope to see some positive change which will help with the long term success of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=120,2.0,2.37,2.37,1.9600000000000002,2.2220000000000004

It tasted like those microwaveable cakes you get at the store. Very disappointing.  Service: 5/5, unfortunately I do not remember our server's name, but he was very sweet! Even though our food didn't come out as fast as we would've liked, he definitely saved the night. He checked on us constantly (even though he was very busy) and kept reassuring us that our food would be out as soon as possible.  Overall, the food is pretty good (however, I would suggest Cold Stone next door for better dessert)!

I really believe that they need new management and employees who are actually willing to work instead of having an attitude that they don't want to be there. In my opinion they won't last long at the new location and something better should replace it. Now onto my second complaint. I am no twig or skinny girl. I have quite some meat on my bones and when I followed the hostess to our table I could not fit my butt! I fit in all other booths at other restaurants but at Red Robin it was like squeezing play dough through your teeth! I have a sense of humor about it so I laughed and the hostess sat us at a table but Red Robin, come on!! My twig sister and my brother who is physically fit barley had any room! Its uncomfortable for any normal human. I'm sure they are just trying to squeeze as much people in but lets be real here!! I will have to pass on Red Robin from now on.

Second-took my daughter to the restroom (did not pay the bill yet) half our meal still on the table, came back to an empty table. Then had to wait for it to come back out and I asked for it to go, manager came back with food on plates,  I told her situation and she says,  sorry.   Third- ordered a salad platter to go,  come home to a tiny portion I have ever seen for a meal. For a $13 meal.   Fourth- the servers need to be retrained and more attentive to the needs of the customers.  When your drink is empty and they pass your table not that frequently by the way, they should  have another drink for you, or work as a team and have other servers assist.   I hope this gets to the right people to please make changes or this place will not last long.   Lousy service, mediocre food, untrained staff, very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=120,1.84,2.33,2.33,1.864,2.1340000000000003

Good thing was that the wait wasn't too long because it was just a friend and me. If you come in a large party be prepared to wait a bit. We were seated at the bar and the service was a bit lacking. We ordered the chili cheese fries while she got the guacamole burger. The food was alright but the burger came with barely any guacamole. We were slightly disappointed. The fries were decent and had some jalapeño slices on top of the fries so it gave a good kick of spice. I thought we had a cool server because she was nice in the beginning but I was a bit bummed at the end when we asked for to go boxes and didn't get them in time. I understand she's busy so we asked another server to get us the boxes and when our original server saw us with the to go boxes already she gave us an apology but she didn't seem genuine about it. But that's okay, once again, I understand that servers always have a lot on their plate. It's very stressful handling crazy customers.

I'd really hoped that with the switch of location some of the issues we'd been experiencing might've been addressed but was disappointed when we went for diner recently. We had purposely waited until a little later in the night to head over thinking we'd beat the crowd so we we be in and out pretty quick. We chose to sit in the bar area which is open seating. We were more or less able to walk right in and sit down. It ended up taking about ten minutes for someone to take or drink order, then another ten or so to get our three sodas and glass of wine (mind you we were sitting in the BAR AREA). We finally got our drinks and places our orders for food. That had to have taken *at least* another 40 minutes or so while the woman at the next table over (I kid you not) whips out several bottles of nail polish, sets them on her table, and begins giving herself a mani in the middle of the bar while she waited for the remainder of her party to get there.

Apparently the cook thought it would be funny to send the waitress back to the table to tell us that they were out of chili. She had to come back and apologize because it was only a joke. Ordered 2 medium Burgers but one came well done. The Tomato Burger ordered with extra tomatoes came with one scrawny slice of tomato. Also the wrong sides came out. But that was all caused by 1 crummy cook who still doing his job and apparently not taking seriously the value of having one. The rest of the staff was extremely polite and apologetic and responsive.

RIP Elephant Bar.  We were always pleased eating here when it was at the mall.  Initial wait was 30 min which is understandable on a holiday weekend prime time.  A bit concerning when I see empty clean tables. Clearly the amount of staff was not able to handle.  But ok, we get our seat ordered our food with a few requested side items to have with our dinner.  Upon arrival of the food my wife asked where inept the side items were.  The food runner said she will get it.  Never came. Then we asked the server.  It's just a side of BBQ that my wife wanted on her burger.  Another 10 min go by and she finished her burger.  Finally she gives her the sauce to an empty plate.  Other items we ordered came later.  Such as my daughters milk shake, which by the way was the wrong flavor. Since we were so hungry and half way through the meal we didn't bother to call her out on it. Endless fries is a plus but that also took a very long time for a re-order. The server seemed very stressed.  Not sure if it's the volume but as a previous food service worker you got to increase your staff.  A good manager will create a solid team     Such as a food runner, servers and bus staff to clean tables and tend to minor customer requests.  I am all for second chances so that new place can get the ball rolling.

My wife and I both enjoyed the different ambiance and seating of this location versus the standardized Red Robin seating arrangement.  It felt a little more relaxed and not so crowded: there were no tables surrounding us as we sat in a more comfortable booth. The menu, the food, the service is all the same as any other Red Robin. Our server was pleasant but seem a bit preoccupied and forgot to bring my wife her beer and the rest of our silverware/napkins until she asked for it as our meals were being brought to us. The only negative I can state at this location was the carpet located in upper seating/booth area where we dined.  There was probably a whole day's worth of food and other debris scattered throughtout the area.

48,Steve B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,105,3.0,2.0,2016-10-25,"Most recent reviews predict this place won't make it.  I agree with them. Went late on Sunday afternoon around 3:15pm. There was no one in the waiting area.  I walked up to the host and hostess and apparently I rudely interrupted their very important personal conversation. Strike one. No greeting or ""Welcome to Red Robin"".  Just a look of contempt from the host named Ty.  I asked for a table for 5 and was told there was a 15 minutes wait. Bizarre since the place wasn't very busy and there was no one in the waiting area.  Ok. Fine. Not sure why, but I can deal with 15 minutes.  Next the Ty person says ""Give me your cell phone number"" with such an attitude that I snap back with the same and say ""Why?!"" He looks at me like we are going to fight or something, and then says ""we'll text you when your table is ready"".  I respond by pointing to a bench 5 feet away and tell him we will be right there. You know, the waiting area where there was no one else waiting except us? Strike two Once our name is called, the hostess just takes off.  Doesn't say anything nice, or look back to see if we are following, just takes off.  We were still by the host stand gathering the troops when she was at the booth in the back of the restaurant. She has to get back to her important conversation with the Ty person I guess. Strike three Place was not clean.  The floor has little food bits and trash strewn around. The booth we were given wasn't particularly clean.  The silverware had spots on it. Yuck. Strike four Of course they were out of the beers that I wanted so I just gave up and had water.  The previous treatment by the so called host and hostess along with the unclean feeling made me not order anything.  Food was slow to come out and refills required chasing down the server. The kids ate all their food and liked playing games on the little console that is at each table. Other than that, I don't have anything nice to say about the place.

107,John G.,"Burbank, CA",0,121,13.0,4.0,2016-10-26,"Came here the other night for a family dinner. Haven't been to a red robin in over 15 yrs at Glendale. First off, parking is good. Large lot, shares with other businesses but had no trouble finding a spot. Large outdoor entrance, and large inside entry. Lots of room for people to sit, stand and wait. There wasn't anyone waiting so we got seated right away by a hostess who was friendly. This place is big! Huge separate bar area, lots of 2 top booths and 4 top booths and a large center area that can be made up for large parties. And a separate other room with more seating. And TVs all over the place. The waitress greeted us and got the kids order and drink orders. They have a large kids menu, which is nice if u have kids because they are picky. So lots to chose from for them!  Took me a while to decide on food because they have a vast menu! Lots to choose from and lots of substitutions and bottomless options! They had so many choices of each thing, I couldn't decide which appitzer to order. Started with the onion rings tower. Which is like 10 fat sweet onions rings and comes with 2 dipping sauces. They were greasy and good.  I went with a bbq bourbon chicken sandwich. It was a good size and they didn't skimp on toppings. I got the bottomless garlic fries, which were very good. And they give u a small batch, and will quickly get u more when u ask. Which I liked because it keeps your fries hot. The Mrs got the garden burger which surprisingly tastes good! Good was fair priced for a restaurant.  I liked how they have the iPad kiosk thing on each table. Because if u want something right away and don't see your waitress you can enter it and the order goes thru. Same with paying, don't have to wait on a waitress to pay and leave.  The only complaints I have are the place seemed a bit dirty. Lots of food bits here and there. Which I know, it's normal in an eatery. But I'm not the first to mention it.

I'd never been to a Red Robin before and didn't understand why there were lines of people waiting outside on a Saturday night. Were the burgers that good, or do we just live in a city that loves chain restaurants?  A few days ago, we got a mailer from Red Robin with a coupon. I thought this would be the perfect chance to try it. We arrived on a Saturday morning right when they opened at 11am. If you were old enough to sit in the bar, you were seated right away. If you had children and needed a regular table, you had to wait 15 minutes while the staff set up the tables (which is odd since i thought open for business meant that you'd be ready to seat people right when the doors open.  We sat at the bar and our waitress/bartender was super! She was attentive (even as more people started being seated) and sweet. I ordered a blue cheese burger (Bleu Ribbon) i think w sweet potato fries and garlic aioli. My bf ordered a regular gourmet cheeseburger with fries. My burger had to have been the worst blue cheese burger I'd ever eaten - ever... The flavor was not good, the bread was barely toasted, the crispy onions were no longer crispy... I couldn't finish it and I love burgers. The sweet potato fries were good, but the garlic aioli (which was extra) was not good. The free ranch dressing that came on the side was better. My bf was also unimpressed with the quality of the burger and fries.  We got our discount, paid at one of those kiosks at the table (which I hate and feel is incredibly impersonal, but I guess most chain restaurants are switching to them) and left.

37,Byron P.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",153,288,44.0,2.0,2017-01-12,"So about a month ago we decided to finally try the ""new"" Red Robin. For some reason, it was touted as a brand new restaurant opening but I believe they just moved from inside the mall. If you were expecting an improvement, you will be disappointed. I typically never go to a restaurant soon after they open their doors, as it usually takes at least a month for them to work out the kinks. Apparently I didn't give this place enough time. We walked in on a Monday night so it wasn't crowded. We were seated immediately. Our server, Danielle,  was pleasant and available most of the time. She is the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Bottom line, the food was bad. I ordered a burger, which is supposed to be their specialty. After all, they call them ""gourmet burgers."" It left me unsatisfied. It was blah. It was some BBQ burger with onion rings, which I typically love. I just tried the link to find its name on the menu but the website was acting funny & it didn't show the burgers. Another strike in my book. I also ordered the garlic fries, which I paid an extra 99 cents for, but they weren't even cooked all the way through, so they were gross. I didn't finish anything on my plate. On our way out, I turned to my wife and asked how her food was, and she made a gross face. My kids didn't even eat all their food. I don't think we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=20,2.2,2.03,2.448,2.536,2.0980000000000003

Needed a good vacuum and tables could have been wiped down a little bit better. I see upon sitting that they have instituted the little pay at kiosk thing that they put at the tables now. Its not a huge deal, but definitely cheapens up the place. My SO and son went to the men's restroom and came back disgusted. They said it stank and was disgusting in there. Son is 5 so he really couldn't hold it.  Service was decent, we ordered our food and can I say mines was horrible as far as flavors went. I got the chicken and waffle sandwich thinking how can I go wrong with that....but apparently very wrong. I though well hey at least I can eat my bottomless fries, except it took FOREVER to get my second order of fries.

The service staff are nice enough, but it looks to me like each is overloaded with too many tables to take care of customers as well as they might like. You know, ask for another drink and by the time it arrives it's almost too late. That sort of thing. The bathrooms need to be cleaned more often and the trash emptied. The last time we went there the hostess almost insisted we sit in the bar. We had to respond ""no"" three different times before she kind of huffed and seated us in the dining room.

I have never had a a consistent experience. Often times the bartender's were terrible and other times the service was just very slow in general. I was really hoping that once they moved and got relocated that they would make some improvements but sadly nothing changed. It seems that they did put more focus on the bar and increase the staff for that area but the food overall is just not what it used to be. I tried going there twice in the new location and both times the food was terrible. I used to really love the bottomless fries which they used to serve in a basket but now they serve it in this crappy metal cup. I understand you can order more but the size of the fries I've gotten way smaller. The last two experiences the fries were cold, very limp and not fresh. It almost seemed as if the fries were recycled off of somebody else's plate like all of the small ends that are left that no one eats. I used to always like to get the crispy cod Burger but even that wasn't good. I've asked around and most of my friends have given the same response that's something changed when they moved in the food just isn't good.

7,Ailyne H.,"Valencia, CA",665,447,2370.0,2.0,2017-04-10,"We took our nephew here to celebrate his 7th birthday, per his request. I was surprised he ordered the kids mac and cheese, given we were in a 'burger joint'. I texted my sister to ask if he always orders that and indeed he does, oh and along with a chocolate shake. Anyway, the service was meh, it was lacking that factor that made you feel like you wanted to be there. Every server in fact that entered the dining room we were seated looked unenthused, making me wonder why we were there... Oh yeah, the birthday boy. The rest of our order was as follows: -Poutine fries: Not the best poutine, but the cheese wasn't bad, if anything would recommend asking for the gravy on the side. Otherwise, you'll have a big puddle of gravy and soggy fries. -Waffle and chicken sandwich: I didn't order this, but the finace said it wasn't great and I could tell because he didn't finish it. He's not one to waste food or not take it go, but he did both. Shocker! -Royal Red Robin burger: Th quality isn't what it used to be. Aside from the service, this was my biggest disappointment. I actually wished I had ate a homecooked meal and was pretty sad we wasted our calories on dining here. Anyway, it wasn't a complete wash. Our nephew had a great time and that was the whole point. If it was just me and my man looking for a place to dine out, I won't be returning here. Also, the whole pay for your check at the table on their iPad machine was a new experience for me and it just added to that impersonal vibe even more. Surprisingly the machine asked if I wanted a receipt, I hit yes, thinking it would print up front and someone would actually have to bring it to me. Um, no. A receipt spit out, but was completely blank. RR was in the regular rotation years back when I worked in Woodland Hills and was great.

1,Jeffrey A.,"Granada Hills, CA",6,10,2.0,1.0,2017-11-01,"Service in the bar is a joke at lunch time.  I sat patiently whilst I watched one server run around serving way to many tables, oh and that was also the bartender.  When I can hear other customers complaining about service, that's my cue to leave. What a waste of my lunch time.  No drink, no lunch, just a menu. DISMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,3.0,2.61,2.4,,2.766

0,JoAnna S.,"Simi Valley, CA",42,91,105.0,3.0,2017-11-10,"I walked into the restaurant with great expectations remembering the last one I went to in Topanga Mall.  My family was seated as I was taking pictures of the pictures they had up in the front of the restaurant. The waitress never said come on .. nothing. I turned around and they were gone and seated.  The floors and tables looked clean and free of debris. We were waited on quickly and did not have to wait longer then 10 minutes for our food. It was very appealing to the eye, however did not taste very good. I ordered the veggie burger and I'll never order it again. The waitress took our left over food away when we weren't done and then never asked us if we wanted to take it home. Then later on our waitress, Jolene had the nerve to come over and ask us before our desert whether or not we could move to another table because she was getting off work and wanted to get the tip rather then her replacement getting it. Oh and when our food came it came without napkins. Dressing and juice was coming from my burger down my hands and I had nothing to dry them with. I had to get up and go ask another waitress for napkins. Jolene never asked us if we were satisfied with our meal or checked on us.  The other waitress whose name was Stephanie was super. She would go from customer to customer making sure they were happy. She also gave me my napkins. I wish we would have had her.  We went into the bathroom and there were no sanitary napkins for the toilet seat and there was paper all over the floor. It was pretty dirty. After leaving the bathroom, I went over to the manager to tell him of our concerns. I told him our waitress was friendly but very unprofessional. I also praised the waitress that was not ours. Honestly, I don't think he cared at all. I won't be back at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,3.16,2.67,2.396,,2.8660000000000005
13,Gen E.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,52,9.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"Ok we usually love Red Robin and we eat at Red Robin all the time. But this branch is pretty awful. The service is just ok. Also, if you order to go, be prepared to wait about 20 minutes extra once you walk in to pick it up before you get your order. It really seems like they wait to make it until you get there. Lastly, the picture below is why we won't be coming back. The left is what the picture on their menu shows. The right is what I got. And it was as disgusting as it looks. Is this a joke? Pub Mac and Cheese... more like Puke Mac and Cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,3.04,2.67,2.4,,2.8180000000000005

14,Kris C.,"Lancaster, CA",3,18,2.0,2.0,2017-11-24,"Food is okay, all meals were brought out separately...we had 6 in our group and they couldn't manage to get our food brought out to us at the same time.  Everything we asked for that didn't come with dinner ie; bbq sauce, mustard, etc had been brought out late. The manager came to tell us they were working on the rest of our meals and didn't really seem too concerned. This is annoying especially since we have a toddler and have to time everything around her and when meals are staggered it creates frustration for everyone more so than normal. Our waitress was nice enough but it still doesn't make up for the horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,2.88,2.66,2.404,,2.748
16,Sean C.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",79,3,,1.0,2017-11-25,"Since this location had moved grim the mall, it is HORRIBLE. The service is slow and when we ask the manager to turn the air conditioner on as it was very warm inside, he apprised us that corporate controls the temperature. It seems that corporate has made many changes that have impacted my family and I from returning. E.g. smaller portions yet higher prices, lack of service, removal of menu items, self ordering machines that don't work most of the time, etc etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,2.88,2.65,2.4,,2.742
8,Flowerchild M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,2.0,2017-11-30,"I'm not giving one star just because I don't want to be cruel.  This was my very first time going to any Red Robin.  When we got there we were seated very fast.  However, it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to actually come greet us and ask us for our drinks.  The waitress was polite but never smiled.  Maybe this is not the type of food for me but the burger I order was beyond greasy and cold when it arrived.  My husband ordered what is supposed to be bottomless fries, and to be honest I have never seen a plate with so few fries to start with.  When he asked for more they brought literally like 6 fries in one plate.  I almost left everything in my plate.  I really don't think I will try another Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia,2.76,2.63,2.396,,2.6819999999999995

32,Tyler C.,"Castaic, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-22,"Wow. Just wow. I met a friend for dinner and we both ordered drinks, an appetizer and burgers. About half way through eating my friend notices a large clump in his Mushroom Swiss Burger. The thing looked like a hair ball pulled from a drain. Needless to say we stopped eating. Our waitress came back to the table and we pointed it out. Her response was they are using new mushrooms in the kitchen. Really?!?! We ask to speak to the manager and she takes this ""thing"" with her. We should have taken a photo first. The manager, Sam, comes back and tells us the same ""new mushroom vendor"" story and they had seen this before and offers to clear our remaining plates and then disappears. Then nothing! 10 minutes later our waitress comes back apologetic and letting us know the manager is taking off my friends burger off the bill. That's it? At this point we are pissed and ask to see the manager again. He comes back and asks us what we want to do. Maybe do the right thing and apologize and comp the meal? We tell him we want the GM's name and that we are paying the whole bill and flaming them for the poor handling of this. He disappears and we try and pay on the Ziosk on the table and they had locked it. A guy named Cliff comes over and introduces himself as the GM and tells us that the manger should have told us the meal was comped and told us that he had never heard of any other complaints about the mushrooms. After a heated exchange we left. Needless to say I won't be visiting this location anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-valencia?start=20,2.88,2.67,2.404,,2.7539999999999996
