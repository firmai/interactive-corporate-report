Jannel W.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,5,,5.0,9/4/2017,We went on 9/1/2017 right when they opened.  This is by far the best Red Robin I have ever been to. The staff was very attentive. We didn't have to ask for refills on anything. Chris was our server (I think he was also a bartender?) and he did an absolute wonderful job.   The order was 100% accurate. The restaurant was clean. The manager touched our table to make sure everything was going alright.  We left very pleased with this Red Robin. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be stopping by.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20

Christina M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,48,17,1.0,9/13/2017,"I'm writing this review as I'm sitting here for 35 minutes waiting to order while my waitress is ""hanging out"". My husband had to get up to go get her because she was sitting down hanging out with some co workers. I'm so annoyed, I honestly just want to get up and leave. I shouldn't have to tell someone how to do their job. Absolutely disappointed in her service. I had to update this review it's now been ONE HOUR and I still do not have my appetizer. Ridiculous. Anyways, some tall bald guy (im guessing the manager) came over after waiting for our drinks for 45 minutes and mentioned ""I'm sorry the drinks are taking a while.. don't blame your server. it is my fault"" Okay?? so whoever's fault it is/was i shouldn't have to wait this long.Maybe your understaffed? Maybe its lack of teamwork? Whatever it is, i'm a customer and that's not my fault. i was expecting him to comp or even give us a discount. Nope nothing at all. I will not be back ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20
Javier M.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",34,349,5,4.0,5/5/2016,"We stopped in for an EARLY dinner. The kids enjoyed their meals and so did we. I was decided on the Whiskey BBQ Chicken Wrap before we even arrived. The wrap came with Steak Fries too. I recommend this dish. It was very tasty and I did not feel like a hot air balloon when we left. The kids also had their favorite mini shake. We have passed this place numerous times on the way to the theater or another spot in the center. It was clean inside and the crowd was sparse. Yeah, we walked in at 2:30. The service was good but that little table top paying system is for the birds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20
Kathie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,3,,1.0,10/30/2017,"This was our first visit to the Rancho Mirage Red Robin.  We have had much better experiences at other RRs.  Service here was rather slow; the couple next to us arrived much later than we did, and were served at the same time as us. I was not happy with my lunch, which was a ""perfectly cooked"" (per the menu) seared salmon.  At first, it was quite dry.  I mentioned this to the server, who said she'd let the kitchen know.  (No apology.)  Later in the meal, I came upon a really unsavory part of the fish, and mentioned this to the server as well.  She reiterated that she'd tell the cooks about it.  I wasn't really telling her these problems this in order to improve the meals of future customers, but rather to let her know that I was very unhappy with my meal.  Again, no apology whatsoever.  I found this off-putting, as was the salmon. We both used the restroom on our way out.  My husband mentioned that the toilet in the men's room was covered with urine.  Ugh.  In the women's room, there were signs for the servers telling them how to wash their hands:  specifically, the length of scrub time AND the (very warm) water temperature needed.  I ran the water in the sink for some time, and it never got beyond cold.  So this is where the servers wash their hands? Last but not least, this is a tiny thing, but when we asked for toothpicks on our way out, we were told that they didn't have them.  Surprising for a restaurant, and a very cheap perk to offer. We'll probably try another Red Robin again, but definitely not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20

Hannah H.,"Palm Desert, CA",102,13,2,3.0,5/29/2017,"This is an overall good Red Robin. The staff is friendly and attentive, food is good, there's never a long wait. However, instead of a 5 star rating I gave it a 3 because the hallway to the bathroom constantly smells like diarrhea. No matter what day I come or what time it reeks. which is weird because the bathroom itself does not smell. Just the hallway. They should maybe get some air fresheners. It's a little hard to stomach or work up an appetite when you want to wash your hands and have to walk through it back to your table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20

David R.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/9/2017,"My wife and I go here quite often. It's usually good, but it seems like lately the French fries are not as good as they used to be. They get hard very fast, and even if they bring you out more, it's the same thing. It didn't seem this way in the past, but maybe they changed the cooking oil.

Glen K.,"Thousand Palms, CA",110,218,2,4.0,1/6/2018,"Happy Birthday to ME! As a member of the Red Royalty, I get a free Gourmet Burger at Red's.  My wife and I arrived just after six on a Saturday night - movie night - and the place was packed. We were told there was up to a 40-minute wait but we could eat at the bar. Rather than wait and get hungrier and hungrier, we opted for that.  I decided on the A.1 Peppercorn Burger, normally $11.89. She got the small Red's Tavern Double, which is a very good deal at $6.99.  We enjoyed our burgers - yummm! The service was fine except they brought her fries instead of the requested salad. Maybe the server couldn't hear over the din because, as I mentioned, the place was full of people and it was very noisy. But still it was a nice time. Here's a little hint: whenever you get a free or discounted meal like this, figure your tip on the total price as it would be if it wasn't discounted. Otherwise if I had gone in by myself and had only water, the tip would have been zero. The server has to work just as hard even if the business takes a hit.

Somehow we watched table after table sit, get their order taken, be served, eat, get their check, and leave before us.  We asked various wait staff for refills on drinks and additional bottomless items and waited forever for them to come.  Yes, it was dinner time on a Saturday night. I get that.

It's a fun place with cool decor. Balloons for the kids were a big hit, but I'm not sure the other guests thought so.  The fries are endless as well as the kids sides. Even though my kids split a meal the waitress still gave the kids more mandarin orange pieces when they finished there first order. I'm sure she didn't have to do that.

Wendy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,196,382,3.0,7/16/2017,"I feel like I eat at the same places whenever I'm in the desert... so decided to give Red Robin a shot for dinner. We were seated quickly, since we had just missed the busy dinner rush. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and they came out quickly too. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad with extra chicken and a side of french onion soup... the soup was just OK. Wasn't very hot, so the cheese on top sort of just stayed in one large mass. Had to cut it up with my spoon, and I quickly gave up. The salad was good, but I had to ask for extra salad dressing... it didn't seem like they put enough dressing. It started off as just lettuce and chicken. Overall it was pretty filling. I think you'd have to ask for extra chicken. My friend ordered the croissant BLTA sandwich. Half of the sandwich came with good slices of lettuce, while the other half had shredded taco lettuce. They had to have run out halfway making her sandwich. Kinda funny... Overall it was a decent meal. It's a chain restaurant... can't expect to have a flawless experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage

So I decided to give this a chain the benefit of a doubt with a 4 star average.  First time I went, the service was awesome, fast, friendly. And the food was quick and tasty. BOTTOMLESS FRIES! Had a pina colada what that was dangerously delicious. Left super happy and efficiently. Second time we decided to dine here, we were sat immediately in the back of the restaurant, then moved to a different table because the waitress said she might forget about us if we weren't in the front seating area... okay no big deal, we gave our drink orders and mentioned we were kinda in a rush because we had a movie to catch. Waitress came back and we gave our food order. I wanted to substitute my burger patty with the vegan party and all was well. Waitress didn't come back until 15 minutes later and said they were out of the vegan patties but tried to sub me the veggie patty. Didn't care for that and just wanted fries. She insisted I try the veggie patty and that she would comp our whole meal. Very generous but it was a very uncomfortable situation. Manager stopped by to give her condolences and the food came 6 minutes after that. At that point, we asked them to wrap it up to go. Sat in my car and unwrapped my burger, to take a bite full of pickles!! I was so upset lol hate pickles and just had that one serving of fries.

Upon receiving the order, one house salad was missing and a big long white hair sticking out of the Togo container for the Ranch dressing. After calling Grubhub customer service, our representative called Red Robin to explain and they maintained all items in the bag. They did not acknowledge the hair nor the missed item and refused to Credit or resend a side salad.  Grubhub, the consummate professionals honored a future Credit on behalf of the mistake.

I've only had it once but even writing about it now I feel like I should be heading there for one. They add extra cheese which melts and covers the meat with absolute perfection. It was delicious.

On to the food my wife's favorite meal is a prime rib dip which says it comes with coleslaw and french fries they give you literally one tablespoon of coleslaw which their coleslaw is pretty good and when you complain about that they say it's a garnish well then don't listed on the item in the menu as being a side garnish and sides are completely different things in a restaurant. They're one redeeming factor and I think the best thing on their menu surprisingly is there cod fish and chips, the second best thing on their menu is there fried mushrooms and zucchini their burgers are never hot enough and always have too much dressing the tomatoes on their burgers are paper-thin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=40
Mike G.,"Yuma, AZ",53,10,,1.0,5/30/2017,"I normally have always been happy with Red Robin, this location, I will likely never visit again. Whether it was the half hearted welcome from a hostess who barely made eye contact, to the booth at which we were sat that had yet to be wiped off yet we were sat there anyhow. After we cleared items to one side of the table the waitress states, oh that table needs to be wiped off, ya think!? My visit was 29 May, in the evening, waitress was Noel, and she did do a solid effort in salvaging our visit. After receiving a draft beer which tasted awful (805 was simply not up to standard that night) she replaced it with another selection and made sure it was not charged. Originally I had asked about what IPA's were available on draft, I was given a quick verbal listing of all available beers, which was incorrect since I later saw a full listing on the wall in chalk.... if you don't know what you offer, why should I want any of it? The food was minimally acceptable by Red Robin standard, however the ranch dressing was watered down somehow, I was tempted to make a video, dipping a fry into dressing shouldn't resulted in said dressing dripping off the fry like it was milk. Watching another staff member in a black polo shirt converse with a customer/friend about the hockey match on, while noticing the menu's and other items on the table were sticky and dirty and likely had not been cleaned in quite awhile made me feel like leaving... however, the food was warm, but in a ""high-end"" burger joint, when the first good point that comes to mind is ""food was warm"" .... that means you seek another location. The issues with my visit do have one thing related, management, all of these things show it is they that need replacing, dirty items, menu's, poor server knowledge, lack of enthusiasm, are all things that don't exist when management is solid, when it's not, again, you find another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=40

Salad didnt come with much dressing but waitress was able to get more quickly..... dressing was intentionally made fresh n warm?  That was new to me but tasted good nevertheless.... guess in europe the beer is warm too so definitely something different...tasty all the way.

This booth was at least 2 inches less clearance on both side than their standard tables . It was so noisy that you couldn't hear yourself talk and unfortunately I had two kids behind me that never stop screaming . I ordered the prime rib dip . It wasn't prime rib it was just Roastbeef overcoat no flavor . My 90-year-old mother ordered the mac & cheese . It was dry hardly had any cheese in it and just horrible tasting another one of my guests ordered the shrimp and chicken also overcoat and tasteless . The other two meals were just okay .

Joe K.,"Cathedral City, CA",138,38,,1.0,5/22/2017,"I don't know who management is, but there is certainly no pride in quality control at this Red Robin. Such a shame, because I typically enjoy the atmosphere and taking the family there numerous times. Tonight, just me and my wife. She had a salad and I had the Ensenada Chicken platter, which also comes with a salad, which I asked for Olive Oil and Vinegar. First off, I asked for two chicken pieces and the server only brought one.  Okay, I can overlook that as an honest mistake, no harm. BUT THEN, I get the oil and vinegar.... Oh my gosh, if I posted a pic, you'd be disgusted. Visually, I saw the containers were full of crud on the outside, oil or who knows what. I used a napkin to wrap around it in order to use it. Yup, napkin stuck to the oil one. The vinegar one was just somewhat sticky. Then, the first of the chicken breasts was over done...just about rubbery. Yes, I ate it. Sauce made it tolerable. Then the 2nd breast came. That one was perfectly done. I go back thinking my last visit was a fluke and it can't always be that bad, but I gotta say, my last few visits have been anything but great.

Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3417,2.0,11/23/2013,"After getting stuck on the 210 to the 10 Freeway Transition headed to Phoenix, I got hungry. All that waiting in traffic made me warm up and gave me an empty stomach. With the help of Yelp, I found a safe bet at Red Robin's in Rancho Mirage.  I had arrived around 7pm Friday evening and Rancho Mirage was bloody windy. I had to run from the movie parking lot to Red Robin's front entrance. This Red Robin's was pretty packed. There was a wait of about 5-10 minutes. I am not sure if the crowd was because of the movie theatre or the trip to/from Phoenix or it was just Friday for Rancho Mirage. This was one busy location that I have ever seen. Probably more packed than any Los Angeles store locations. My name was called up and I was under the care of my server, Nicole. Like my last Red Robin's visit, I had a hankering for my favorite dish. Right away, I had ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with, of course, bottomless steak fries ($10.19). Don't forget, I don't drink soda anymore. Water is my drink of choice. The wait for my order is about 10-15 minutes. During my observation, the place was always filled. Once a party left, the busboys cleaned the table and the table was ready for the next party.  Another server brought my food to my table and I was surprised it was not Nicole. I am not sure if that is how the procedures works, but it was surprising to me. However, Nicole did check on me on occasion. I've noticed that my order of the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken was smaller than usual. My hands can wrap around it several times over. The taste is consistent like the other Red Robin's locations, but the value for the size I ordered was not consistent. Also, the amount of fries that I received did not fill the metal cup on my plate. I did ask Nicole for more fries, but the first dish should have plenty of fries upfront. I was not at all satisfied with the meal, but it was close to satisfactory as I could get this Red Robin's to meet my criteria. However, it was close to a fail. My road trip to Phoenix had only one memory that I don't want to remember, but I have to. Well, I think I need to get my Red Robin's Royalty Card soon. Too many visits already...or not not enough?!

I loaded it with the seasoning salt, of course. On to the burger, the pineapple was not good. It wasn't even yellow. It was white and not good.

Being I have been in the food service industry I consider myself a heavy tipper and was going to leave the change for the server up until he asked if I wanted any change at witch I replied a little. over fifteen minutes went by before he brought my change, being the stubborn person I am I wasn't going to leave without it.  Sad how a waiter can turn a customer, all he had to do is say i will be right back with your change and I would have left all of it for him.

HOWEVER, the GF loves the place and I forsee eating there at least once a week.. Fortunately, the menu is broad enough that I'm sure I'll find SOMETHING I can agree with... Let's take a look, shall we?: Parking is ample, but I sense there is a spot for a Riverside County Sherriff to hide at like a trap door spider and round out his DUI quota...  Speaking of that, there is a Plethora of potent potables to choose from (would you say I have a ""Plethora of Pinatas?"") so I guess the GF and I will have to arm wrestle over ""Who"" is ""DD"" tonight.  The food IS good, AND plentiful, and you CAN use their onion rings to put new tires on your lawn mower.  But there is ALWAYS the spectre of that Burger King Mardi Gras Head sneaking up on me..   IF he does, I'm decking that Pirata like he's never even thought about...  I will wipe that psycho grin off his face like a Dentist with a drill.   ~""GREAT Dusty, you just SHOT the Invisible Swordsman!!""~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=100

The burgers and fries are very tasty, and the presentation is good. My only complaint is many times when I go in there, the wait staff does not write down the order. (That always concerns me that  the order will be screwed up). And lo and behold, many times the order is. Usually not major things, but the little details, like adding lettuce when asked not to, forgetting to bring condiments that were asked for ahead of time.

The girl came back and told us there was a booth available but then got into a huddle with two other incompetent asshat employees and decided that actually there's going to be a wait because they apparently don't have anyone working on a Sunday night. Apparently about 10 customers puts them at capacity. We were literally the only people in the waiting area, so why the girl was acting like we were asking her to solve a rubix cube is beyond me.  Seemed like they decided to bullshit us based on the fact we had a baby in a carseat with us, which apparently confused the shit out of them because they were baffled as to how to lead us to our table. With every other restaurant (including other Red Robins) the server usually says something along the lines of ""This way."" Then get this next part... They start WALKING! Then we follow them and BAM you are now at a table. A concept that evidently has yet to be discovered at this location. It's a shame because pretty much every other Red Robin is great.

The gluten free bun was cardboard I think, worst gf bun I've had anywhere. If only they were a huge chain and could find a really good gf option. Oh wait... The mac and cheese for kids used to include free refills, but no longer. And the bottomless fries were just like the chips...you get like 7 per serving and have to rely on your wait staff to bring continuous refills. Clearly they think they are serving a 5 year old child and not a grown adult male. Service was so slow I imagine they were out back harvesting the potatoes.

Brian G.,"WEST HILLS, CA",0,45,13,1.0,5/24/2015,"I love Red Robin, but will never visit this location again. If you are on vacation in Palm Springs (Rancho Mirage), DO NOT VISIT THIS RED ROBIN! We were a party of 12 on vacation and it all started with a phone call. We called and asked if we could get a table and they said yes. Upon arriving, they said they don't take reservations and we would have to split up. The guy that answered the phone first denied saying he could seat us together but finally admitted his mistake. We sit down (at separate tables) and the server got half the orders and then disappeared, forgetting everyone else.  The service and experience was so bad that the manager came over to apologize and offered us a discount off our bill.  Which would have been nice, but he didn't tell anyone else so when the bill came we had another fight on our hands.  Service was bad, manager showed no authority or control over his staff, poor communication, and just a bad experience.   I love Red Robin, but will never visit this location again.

Steve R.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,10,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Usually very good even with the obligatory wait. Today, there was no wait... the order was bagged and waiting when we arrived in spite of the Sunday afternoon crowd (ordered by phone 15 minutes earlier). And when we got home and looked at the food, we knew why it was ready so quickly. It was old food. Cheeseburger that looked like it had been flattened, wilted lettuce, melted and then congealing cheese and dressing, tomatoes that looked like they'd been sliced and sitting in the fridge too long, and the 5 1/2 undercooked fries (okay, maybe there were a few more than that, but just barely) just plain sucked. And the fried fish was so greasy I thought they must have poured it straight from the pot to the box. And for the first time, we couldn't help but notice how sticky the floor was. We'll go back, but I can guarantee than the next time we'll be looking at our order with a critical eye.

The manager stopped by to check in on us. Neatly dressed, close short haircut and a quick wit. Very personable.

Wayne B.,"Seattle, WA",0,35,,2.0,1/3/2015,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin for some time.  The original location in Seattle was a favorite hangout for years.  I'd read about the new ""finest"" line of burgers, and thought I would try this location out.  So, so disappointing! First, the service was strange. My burger took over 20 minutes to arrive while others all around me received their food in a timely manner. The fries were old and potato-chip crisp. Yuk. By the time I received replacement fries, I was done with my burger.  Finally, the burger was a big disappointment. The flavor was okay, but the beat was a bit dry and I had to give up on the bun about a 1/3 into it because the bottom bun was drenched with grease.  Certainly not worth the extra 5 bucks.  My advice: stick with one of their original burgers.  Even better: eat at the Burger and Beer right next store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=140

I've had the protein burger at Carl's Jr., In-n-Out and a variety of non-chain places. The way that Red Robin chefs choose the lettuce leaf to wrap their protein burger is a lesson to be learned by all others. And the burger itself is excellent. All other places just slap two pieces of lettuce around the burger. Red Robin chooses the leafs that form an almost perfect hamburger bun.

My date had the cod fish and chips.  He thought they were pretty good even though he really wanted the salmon instead.  Apparently RR  stopped making the fish and chips with salmon but it still showed on the menu. The assistant manager came out, explained and apologized.  Nice service touch. The server was really friendly and he checked in often.  He surprised my date and me when he said the burger was on the house because it took a bit longer than usual to get it to the table.  Although i hadn't noticed the delay (the sign of a good date), it was nevertheless a nice thing to do.
