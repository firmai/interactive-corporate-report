Paige B.,"Hopewell, NJ",30,4,1,1.0,5/20/2017,"If I could give this location no stars, I would. As soon as we walked in the place seemed a bit empty. There were a few parties ahead of us and we were told 15 minutes until we could be seated for 2. In the meantime there were 2 hostesses who didn't seem to know where to sit people. A waitress came over to help and they started arguing, loudly. Being a manager of a pizzeria/restaurant that kind of behavior is extremely intolerable. They nearly hit each other and no one seemed to care to stop it. A half an hour went by before I finally had to go up to the counter... people who had come in after us had been seated already, only to be told they forgot to write our name on the list. 3 people at the hostess desk doing nothing but staring at us and no one thought to ask? After 30 minutes?  After being seated no manager came to apologize or anyone for that matter.  Food was below average and place seems very unkempt.  I would suggest a different location!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=20

Devi S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",44,23,41,1.0,9/30/2017,"First of all the food was not that good... The waitress was friendly at first and being very rude at the end... When we ask him to refill our endless appertizer, He explained to us that we cannot share the endless appertizer. We will be okay if he explain to us in a manners way... But the way that he was talking to us was NOT OKAY!!! He was talking on the other Side of our table where there was a half wall on that side of the table and in a loud voice!!! My husband was very embarassed by it. The waitress can explain to us on the other side of our table where theres NO half wall where he stand and not in a loud voice!!!. We spend money with the liquors and was about to order more martini until he was being rude to us!!! Will I ever go back to that Fridays??? Maybe NOT!!! My kids will rather go to Zin Burgers or Cheesecake!

The whole place is empty and the host has to go ask the manager where you can put someone, the servers are complaining about getting a table. Once we're finally seated after 15 mins, no server for another 20 mins. Finally someone comes and is out of breath and asks if anyone has come up to us and she just got here. Ew.

Celine M.,"Summit, NJ",202,2,,1.0,6/2/2017,The food is amazing however the service was absolutely horrible. I understand the restaurant business because I worked my whole life in the industry and I can say that it was absolutely horrible. I really hope the managers fire the workers and hire new ones because that service was incredible with how slow the waitress is. Our server name is Courtney and she was absolutely horrible. I would never go back to this location. The food was already cold when it had reached the table meaning that it had been sitting on the food counter for a while. I kept having to remind her for things and it took forever to get service in the beginning.

Tara D.,"Highland Park, NJ",0,10,2,1.0,8/28/2016,"Upon ordering my entree on Sunday, August 28, 2016 with waitress Chris at TGIF 401 Gill Ln, Iselin, NJ 08830, NJ I displayed my 150 strip reward showing the entree that I was ordering. I ordered additional sides and a club soda with lime.  Chris, a female waitress told me that I had to order a drink in order for her to accept my stripes reward. I questioned her statement and asked why? She informed me that her manager told her that strip rewards will not be honored unless customers ordered a drink. I asked Chris to show me that in writing. She responded that her manager told her not to accept them without a drink order. I showed Chris the fine print on my reward stating, ""no minimum purchase required."" Chris responded that she couldn't accept the stripes statement. I told Chris that I felt uncomfortable with her demand but that I planned to order other food.  I finished my dinner, ordered dessert, and coffee and Chris told me that I still needed to order a drink. I informed her that I did not want a drink and asked for a manager. I showed her the stripes reward again stating that a minimum order was not required. Jimmy came over. I asked if he was a manager as he never stated whether he was. He responded, yes. I showed him my stripes reward and explained my concern. He told me that he and Jamie were the managers on duty and that he was not accepting my stripes reward unless I ordered a drink. I asked for the names of the restaurant and General managers, along with the restaurant number.  Jimmy told me that he did not remember. I asked him to show me restaurant disclosure regarding the stripes program indicating the minimum purchase requirement but he could not find one. He insisted that Jammie informed him that I had to purchase a drink.  The Stripes program clearly indicates that members don't have a minimum purchase amount. In addition, I purchased a side of shrimp, dessert, and a coffee and was harassed three times while eating my rib eye meal and then dessert by Chris about purchasing a drink or refusal to accept my stripes reward. Jimmie, assistant manager continued the same.  This location does not honor the corporate rewards program. When I asked Jimmy, he stated that they are not required to do so. Jimmy only accepted my stripes reward after I told him that I was going to contact their corporate offices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=20

Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",252,682,369,2.0,6/1/2014,"I really enjoy their food, but this TGIF, like all the others I have been to over the years, seems to suffer from lack of quality service.  In fact, my wife will generally refuse to go here because of that.  This time I convinced her because a client gave me a gift card.  Plus I received a coupon in the mail with several offers including either 20% off or a free entrée.   So, we arrive and the hostess tells us it will be about 5 minutes.  I ask if she wants my name and she said not to worry as she can recognize us.  There may have been one other couple waiting.  I'll say yes to that and give them the benefit of the doubt.  We sit and after about 5 minutes, I look up and that hostess is no longer there but all of a sudden a few different groups are coming in and asking for tables.  The ""new"" host came over to us and asks if we were waiting and if so, needs our name.  I told him what happened with the prior hostess and he said nothing.  Now I am wondering if we will ever get seated.  We did get seated shortly thereafter but did I need this extra stress?  Really?   Communication skills people!!! We are seated and given the menus.  There are a lot of drink options and most of them don't have prices.  I don't like that.  I must have sounded like a real cheapskate asking the prices of various drinks.  More to come on this later. Our server was good and so was the food.  I had a Yucatan Chicken Salad and my wife had a Cobb Salad.  We also had the Pretzel and Cheese appetizer.  No complaints at all about the food or the drinks. Time to pay.  I ask for the check and give him the coupon card and also tell him I have a $25 gift card.  No problem with that and he takes free entrée off as it was a bigger discount than the 20%.  Brings the check and stands there waiting for me to pay.  I told him I am not ready to pay and he left.  What was with that?  Was he afraid I had never been to a restaurant before and would screw up the tip because of the discount?  I guess me asking for the drink prices must have scared him into thinking I was a penny pitcher.  I actually left  a generous tip, not so much that I was thrilled with everything, but that the meal didn't cost me much due to the discount and the gift card. The next day I realize he never gave me back my discount card that still had 2 more uses in it for the next 20 days or so.  At first I was annoyed then realized there is no way I am gong back, at least for anytime soon.     If anyone is planning on giving me a gift card, make it for Houlihans or Cheesecake Factory.  I can do without TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=20
Err W.,"Carteret, NJ",0,17,,2.0,9/2/2016,"I don't usually like chains but family couldn't all agree on one place so we just ended up here. I know you can't expect much from places like this but it is what it is.  I  hadn't been to this location in a couple of years, but it has definitely gone downhill.  Mahi mahi was unbearably dry (and it took longer to cook then the ribs and steaks....), the mashed potatoes are a sad excuse for mashed potatoes (they used to give you more and they were cheesier/more flavorful), and the spinach was just....gross.

R. D.,"Woodbridge, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,5/4/2014,"I used to come this Friday's often and the service has definitely changed for the worse. No wonder this place is always empty. On my most recent trip, I sat at the bar and whole area was inundated with fruit flies!. Talk about being uncomfortable swatting bugs away from your food and drinks. The bartender even scooped a bug out of someones drink with a straw and put a new straw in the drink and gave it to the customer. That was all I had to see at that point. I asked to speak with a manager and he said he was ""too busy"" to come out and speak to me. Way to go customer service! I also called corporate and I was supposed to receive call back from the manager, and that never happened.  I don't want anything from them, just to let them know of my customer experience.  This is  definitely the last time I ever spend my money here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=40
Tayla M.,"Tucson, AZ",30,24,16,3.0,8/12/2014,"TGI Fridays is your typical chain bar and grill. Food was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  They do currently have a deal $10 for unlimited appetizers, but you can only get one type. This was a pretty good deal for us since we just went after work for happy hour. We got several different kinds and shared them all. But none of the options were very healthy, Mostly fried and/or cheesy.  The drinks were pretty good. They had some specials going on. I had a firey apple, which is Sumer shandy, fireball and something else maybe. But it was pretty good and only $5.   Some of the people in my group ordered long islands. Apparently they have two kinds, one for 6 and one for 12 which has better liquor. They were charged for the more expensive one because they didn't know there was a difference. They asked the waiter, he explained the situation. They then offered to pay for it, but the waiter changed the price for them without hesitation. I thought that was great, he ended up with a nice tip.  Even though the food was nothing special there was good service and drinks at decent prices. It's not my first choice, but it was a convenient, easy option that wasn't too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=40

I noticed the bar was empty so we took a seat at the bar on my way to the bar I look around and count 7 tables that are empty. I proceed to have a drink, appetizer, dinner and dessert.  Roughly in the restaurant an hour and four of those 7 tables were never sat.

Jason S.,"Southington, CT",162,362,255,3.0,3/19/2012,Typical inexpensive chain restaurant. I was down in NJ by myself for business and my waitress was very good. The mango peach lemonade slush was very good and had free refills! I had a the Petite Sirloin topped with Langostino Lobster. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't terrible neither.

The only reason we went here is because my mom had a coupon.  Otherwise we would rather not comeback here.  But like I said, If you have to be here, I'd stick with the Jack Daniels food.  Enjoy and good luck.

Ruthy R.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,6,,1.0,3/13/2014,"The worst Friday's I have ever been to and I've given this place 3 tries. The servers are awful: forgetting items ordered, not offering refills, and they give an attitude if you present a coupon. I tip nicely and know to tip on the full price, not the discounted. So I don't appreciate poor service because I showed you I wanted to use one.  The worst of all: undercooked food! I ordered the Korean Steak Tacos which I've ordered at other Friday's and the tortillas were still cold and rubbery. You could barely bite through. Ridiculous. The food in general is over salted in order to make you drink more, but again, they don't ask if you want a refill. Never going back again.

This looks like a straight up date spot, not to mention that all of the seating area surrounds the bar. I was really impressed by the ambiance they created out of the once family-style chain.  Other than this, the food hasn't changed too much. I've always loved their Jack Daniels menu, which they've expanded, and their drink selection is bigger too. I was obnoxiously picky about this one shrimp dish on their 2 for $20 menu and the waiter and kitchen were really accommodating.  Overall I was happy about my experience here.

Yummy pinot grigio, forgot to ask the bartender what brand it was. He was generally nice. I ordered the wedge salad because I didn't want to get spendy, and it was pretty tasty. Their bleu cheese is lip-smackable, and didn't taste like it was from a bottle. I think the bacon pieces could have been better, and the side of jalepenos I ordered were so bland, I thought I was eating plain sweet peppers. Definitely from a can.  Otherwise, I was satisfied.

I brought to his attention that I wasn't being attended to and he gladly sat me. Chris was a phenomenal waiter.

At one point we made eye contact with a waiter, who COMPLETELY ignored us and still didn't come over to ask if we wanted drinks! We were so upset that we got up and switched sections. After making the switch we had a ""temporary"" server who informed us our waitress was on break. she was nice enough but our food took FOREVER to come out, and on top of that it was cold by the time it reached us.

James C.,"Colonia, NJ",0,3,,1.0,3/17/2014,"Yuck, keep looking We stopped here after coming back from NYC. We had a 20% off coupon and figured what the heck.  You needed to show the coupon before ordering which we did,  upon receiving the bill low and behold the 20% ws NOT taken off.   We had french onion soup which came out lukewarm. The glasses and silverware were dirty. Each glass and piece of silverware had pieces of some sort of hard substance on them. I can only imagine what was on the inside of the glasses. The draft beer was skunky, which is ususally caused by not having the lines cleaned out on a schedule. The dinners did not come out at he same time. One was brought to the table 10 minutes after the others. The ribeye steak was tough. The cajun spiced shrimp was not cajun spiced, it was regular Fridays shrimp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=60

Ordered the classic wedge salad and not sure how clean that can be, but I know now never to order one again. It was good, but the thought of the lettuce not being cleaned bothered me.

Vin D.,"Butler, PA",15,131,3,5.0,7/19/2011,"This review is based on my two recent visits here. The first time I went with my mom. Initially a mistake was made on my mom's salad order and also, the dish I ordered, the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, was not so appetizing, the waiter corrected my mom's dish and replaced mine with the dragonfly salmon at no additional cost and also provided me with  free rice. The second time I went myself and ordered the dragonfly salmon. Unfortunately I forgot again that it comes with coleslaw and not rice. However, again I was given complimentary rice. The dragonfly salmon has never disappointed.  Also, the service was very friendly and the corrections were made without any hassle. Pricing is more than adequate. As a result, I give this place 5 stars because of good food (when I order the right dish :) ), excellent customer service, and reasonable pricing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=60

Marlo G.,"Hoboken, NJ",292,651,301,1.0,12/1/2007,"So since we were disappointed by the local Ruby Tuesday's, we went to TGI Friday's which is just around the back of the strip mall... First off, when I checked out the Friday's site to find the location info for this post, I noticed there are Friday's in the UK as well as in other international locations...no wonder the world hates Americans/America!  We're poisoning their countries!  Now you may have noticed Friday's has poured a ton of money into their marketing campaigns, making it seem like a great place for food and fun.  They've changed their ""theme"" which I can't quite figure out.  There are red and white stripes in certain parts of the restaurant and then there are fixtures with blue and red stars...so I want to say it's ""Americana"", but when you have a picture of the Stones, that kind of throws that theory off.  I'm gonna just guess they were going for general pop culture.... They've also been hawking their healthier options under the guise of ""low fat"" and ""right portion, right price"".  Come on!  Who goes to Fridays watching their waistline!  One of their sellers is ""green bean fries""!!!! So here are my sister and me, the carnivore who eats pretty much anything anywhere (except Olive Garden...my sister doesn't like the Olive Garden) and the vegetarian.  Our waiter does one of those ""I'm-gonna-crouch-down-so-I'm-on-your-level/this-is-what-they-trained-me-to-do"" things:  ""Mind if I join you?"" he says, pulling up a chair.  I said, ""If this were a bar, you wouldn't do too well.""   He realllly turned my sister off by doing that! As far as vegetarian options go, as I just said, the green bean fries are in the spotlight.  There is the portobella pasta with a balsamic ""glaze""...I don't know about you, but I don't go for glaze anywhere other than on a donut!  And then there are one or two sides--peas and carrots (frozen, of course) and a side salad (come on!  Who are we kidding!  It's a bagged iceberg-cabbage-carrot mix with some cheddar and american thrown in!).  I had the salad which was HORRIBLE! Now remember, my sister eats anything.  She got the Asian Chicken salad, which, upon eating it, she exclaimed, ""There's nothing Asian about this.  This is a poor excuse for food.  It's disgusting!""  Her salad was the same bagged lettuce mix with some ""chicken"" on top of it...accompanied by a cliantro dressing.  I had no idea cilantro was grown in regions of Asia! This was one of the most miserable dining experiences in recent memory...and I'm guessing any Friday's will be pretty much more of the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin?start=60

Bria M.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",54,63,186,3.0,11/11/2017,The only reason why I am giving this 3 stars is because the food is decent.  The service here is always poor. I'm not sure why but they just don't seem to care about the customers. I have been here a handful of times (not sure why I continue coming back) but each time I've never necessarily been happy with the service.  When I sat at the bar It took awhile for me to be acknowledged. I would have been fine with that if they were busy but unfortunately the bartenders were just having conversations with regulars. When I was finally greeted the bartender just asked me what I wanted to drink. I wasn't given a food menu and there were no drink menus on the counter. After asking for these things and asking for a minute to decide this bartender never came back over to me. About 10+ minutes later the other bartender comes over to me to ask me if I would like another round ! I couldn't help but laugh.  After ordering with this bartender everything was a little better. My ribs with Jack Daniels sauce were good but that's at every Friday's. The brownie obsession was okay as well. My problem isn't with the kitchen it's really just the service.  I don't think I'll be back to this Friday's. There are many other TGIF in the surrounding areas that give way better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-iselin

The waters arrive quickly put it over 10 minutes for my drink. The appetizers took so long to arrive that I set my timer and was ready to walk out. The wait staff and the manager was incompetent. Four times during our visit apps and dishes were being delivered to the wrong tables in our section and they would call out who ordered the ""blank""! My Cobb salad with salmon was pretty gross, every ingredient was lumped in a section, not mixed. Some of the cherry tomatoes were so old that their skin was coming off. The salmon seemed to have been deep fried. My partners burger was ok.  This was the 2nd very bad experience in a row. Two tables next to us were having similar problems. We will not go there again.

I have never seen a restaurant that would make you wait 45 minutes to get cold soup and deliver the soup at the same time as the main meal. When I commented on this, the waitress stated that we did not ask for the soup to be served first. Really??? I had to ASK for the soup to be served first? I'm glad I did not ask for an appetizer. That might have shown up after the desert?  We both just got up and left. Not only was the service crappy, but there was no excuse for that since the place was practically empty.

A whole bunch of TGIFs in jersey were reported for serving bottom shelf alcohol when ordering top shelf to their customers. Not sure if this one was one of em but looks like it's obviously corporate and whomever owns it. I dont blame their staff. They're actually really nice except for who ever made my sandwich.

I had them before they were ""endless"" so I knew this would be a good choice why were they cold when they came to the table...   anything COULD happen right.  I asked the very nice server to take them back to the kitchen and heat them up....  they came back the SAME TEMPRATURE lol.  Somebody say twilight zone.   Hmmmmmmmmm ok let's try the Boneless Wings ok they were tasty but again lukewarm.  Ok TG one last chance let's try the IMROVED Potato Skins.  Yucco shut the front and call the Ghost of Fridays Past caz theywere not good.   I asked for the check but I'm still not understanding why I had to pay for anything.  I did not enjoy one thing oh wait a minute the cherry limeade thingy was refreshing.
