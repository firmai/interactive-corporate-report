16,Buck L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",101,47,139.0,3.0,2013-03-09,"Not bad for a chain restaurant. Decent service, decent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
12,Stephanie T.,"Palmetto, FL",20,82,40.0,2.0,2013-06-20,If it wasn't for the fact that we were meeting some friends for a Birthday celebration we would have walked out immediately. As soon as I walked in the manager told me to take my shirt off....because I was wearing a Miami Heat shirt....and he wasn't joking either...very unprofessional ...and inappropriate.....GO HEAT!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
13,Laura G.,"Tampa, FL",13,29,3.0,4.0,2014-02-01,"This place is always a great choice. We had to wait about 15 minutes which was not bad for a Friday night. When we sat down, our server, Derek, greeted us immediately. He informed us of the new menu options and suggested his favorite items. He was great throughout our entire visit, funny and friendly. When we go back I hope we are seated at his table again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
17,Clint M.,"Bradenton, FL",4,18,,4.0,2014-02-01,"As with all chilies on a Friday night there was a wait. Only a few minutes. The service was prompt and they don't have those stupid kiosk on the table like some of the other chilies I have been to. The margaritas were fuller than other ones I have been to, the food seemed a little better as well, the chips were crispy and not soggy. Great location and good overall experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
9,D J.,"Chicago, IL",14,325,368.0,3.0,2014-11-18,"Basic Chili's...good food...average customer service. I got the Triple Dipper (Big mouth bite w/no bacon, BBW's, & SW eggrolls). Everything was good but my burger buns were scorched a little. Our server went MIA but I guess that's the idea of being able to view your bill & pay at the table.  No biggie, it's Chili's and I don't hold them to a high standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
8,AJ J.,"Longboat Key, FL",12,29,41.0,1.0,2015-01-24,Friendly bartender but everything is terribly dirty. We can see the kitchen floor from here. Yuck. Won't come back. The bar has grooves where food has lodged. Needs an overhaul. Sorry. Nothing good tonsay,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
11,Pete B.,"Bradenton, FL",12,14,,5.0,2015-05-31,"Okay... I can't believe I'm giving Chili's on first street Bradenton five stars. We have been here many times since it was started probably in the late eighties and have seen it shine and falter.  Last night we had a party of 7 and decided to go there after enjoying a local baseball game.  We were seated pretty quickly and were lucky to have a server named Savana and she was terrific. I sure hope she does not mind my using her name. But she was on top of all our needs. Unfortunately our food itself took a rather long time to come out of the kitchen, -not her fault. And Chili's was only about half full.  But the chicken fajitas were outstanding as was everyone else's. For me, Chili's has the best fajitas and boy were they good. Unfortunately the chairs that were moved screeched horribly loud. They really need to address that. So, why five stars? I really should have rated them 4, but I want to bring them up a bit. I would hate to see them close someday. ( like Leroy Selmons )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
7,Cheyenne N.,"Sarasota, FL",2,4,5.0,5.0,2015-07-06,So delicious not more I can say heavenly delicious food   Reasonable prices and friendly waitresses. The chicken was so good and wit the shrimp OH MY GOD  I definitely will be coming back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
14,Jimmy M.,"Duette, FL",0,38,,2.0,2015-07-17,"Our second trip to this restaurant was like the first. We walked in and as usual the greeter quickly greeted us and sat us at a booth as requested. It was a weeknight so the place was only about half or less occupied. We sat there for around ten minutes and the server asked for our drink order speaking so fast it was barely understandable. We ordered water, chips and salsa, it took 15 minutes to get it then place the order. It took 40 minutes to get our food and we never got a refill for our drinks even after we requested one. To sum it up. The food was good as expected, consistent with Chili's quality however the service is in need of drastic improvement. As mentioned before it was our second trip to this restaurant and our last. We will drive to a different Chili's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
10,Melissa T.,"Bradenton, FL",0,37,1.0,3.0,2015-09-27,"Ya know, this is one of those places that are just hit or miss with the service and food. I continue to go few times a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
6,Crystal S.,"Bradenton, FL",35,8,10.0,2.0,2016-01-15,"SMELLS AMAZING FROM THE OUTSIDE, BUT BE WARNED...... Oh boy, where to start with this one. I have NEVER been hit with a wave of cramps and gas and bloating so fast in my life from a restaurant. Ever!  Well here, let's start with the order .... I ordered the 901 Blackberry smash as my cocktail choice (which somehow ended up coming with blueberries instead of blackberries, two totally different flavors and it was $9) and The Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas. My husband had the ""Prime Rib"" tacos.  I quote prime rib, because it was really pot roast, but other than that he says they were ""ok"" but that he would not be ordering them ever again. My chicken seemed to be what I call ""particle chicken"" like it has been chemically separated, treated and bleached, preserved and pressed back together like particle board. I hate particle chicken. Olive Garden also uses this type of chicken in their dinner specials where they advertise a meal to eat and a meal to take home and Applebee's has particle steak....just an FYI. I know some of you out there know what I am talking about, and if you don't, next time you have the chance, check it out. You'll be amazed that you never noticed the difference before.  It's cheap and gross and unhealthy.  Anyway, the shrimp were obviously white bagged frozen and they were pretty undercooked. Not a grill line amongst the bunch, almost as if they'd been boiled, seasoned with season salt and thrown on the hot plate.  The first couple of bites seemed ok, I was starving and had been trying to get to a place to eat all day without much luck. As you know when you're starving the initial taste of food can be misleading. After eating 1 fajita and a couple of bites of green rice, which was hard and heavily over-seasoned with cilantro, I realized how bad it was and I stopped eating. My husband had a bite of mine and commented that the shrimp seemed undercooked. By the time I got to the car, maybe 20 minutes after we had started eating I had full blown severe digestive distress symptoms of gas, bloating, cramps and nausea and the weirdest thing, a lot of pain throughout my shoulder blades.  I came home and was doubled over for an hour or more. I took some Pepto and fell asleep, slowly I started to feel a little better. Upon awakening I was again in horrible stomach pain, so more Pepto for me. Anyway, fellow foodies, there ya have it...I can't say it's food poisoning, but it is absolutely SOMETHING food related. I was 100% fine when we walked into that place and now my night is ruined. I won't be enjoying the company of my husband and friends out and about town this evening. Instead, an evening of Pepto and pain it is.  The only reason I am giving this Chili's 2 stars is because the server was friendly and the place was clean. I didn't complain to anyone about the food, I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible. I would much rather have given a positive review because I really enjoy eating out and good food, but there is nothing enjoyable about digestive distress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
15,Jean T.,"Berthoud, CO",1,29,,1.0,2016-03-06,"Had been disappointed in this restaurant once before, but decided to give them a second chance.  We walked out.  First, the place wasn't even crowded, nobody waiting, and we stood at the front area about 2-3 minutes before anyone appeared to seat us.  En Route to a booth, we were asked to wait while she cleaned the table.  There were several tables that hadn't been bussed.  She wiped the table, but left a dirty bench.  I called her back and asked her to clean it.  After a short wait, a server came and asked what drinks we wanted.  We told her and asked if we could go ahead and turn our food order in, as we knew what we wanted. Our order included chips/salsa, and instructions to please bring our salads out before our entree, so we could enjoy them without having our entree get cold.  She seemed to have a little trouble grasping that instruction.  After a short wait, we were brought water.  Upon inspecting mine, it had black particles in the bottom of the mug, so I caught another waitress and asked if they could replace it.  She said sure, and apologized.  We waited and waited....never got another glass....never got chips/salsa.  While we were being unattended, we noticed several servers spending time with a booth that had a cute dog in a stroller parked at the table.  I didn't think dogs were allowed at indoor dining rooms in Bradenton.  We finally walked out, never to return.  It is a shame management is asleep at the wheel at this restaurant, as we always liked Chili's food in our home town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,

5,Elizabeth M.,"Bradenton, FL",2,20,5.0,5.0,2016-07-19,"This is a fantastic Chilis. One thing I love about the restaurant is that if the food isn't made correctly, they usually take the initiative to correct it before they bring it out. I've never been served a bad dish at this Chilis. The staff is always friendly, never had a bad waiter. The To Go service is great, usually quick and correct!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
4,Danielle A.,"Bayshore Gardens, FL",37,15,4.0,4.0,2016-10-04,"Everyone loves Chili's! I've never had a bad experience here. The food is always fresh, delicious, and well-prepared. From appetizers to dessert, the meal is spot on. A few favorites are the Bacon Ranch Quesadillas with chicken and their burgers are sublime. If you're in the mood for nachos, the skillet queso is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
2,Rebecca B.,"Bradenton, FL",47,65,102.0,4.0,2017-08-05,"You can't really go wrong with their new menu, however some locations are better than other in terms of menu execution and service.  Service is ok at this one, but the food is GOOD! buy 1 get 1 frozen margaritas all day every day...I mean, you can't go wrong with that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
1,Brittany D.,"Bradenton, FL",72,76,133.0,3.0,2017-09-26,"It truly is your average Chili's restaurant. The food is good and they just changed their menu but they are still very average.  I will say that in recent months, the managers have had a stronger presence on the floor. I had an unfortunate incident just last week where the pasta I ordered came to the table ice cold. Not wanting to make a fuss, I ignored the problem until the server could tell I wasn't eating all of the food. The manager came by immediately, arranged for me to have one order to go for free and discounted the pasta I already had. I was quite impressed by her professionalism and proactive behavior.  Normally, I do not have problems. This was the first time this had happened to me at one of their locations. I will, of course, be back in the future as their patron margaritas hold a special place in my heart.  Hopefully next time will be better and I can up them from 3 stars to 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
0,Samantha R.,"Bradenton, FL",21,9,5.0,5.0,2017-11-05,"Came here tonight with my boyfriend for a date night. We decided to sit at the bar upon arrival. While there our bartender/waiter was a young man named Sean. He was beyond fantastic! He was very attentive whenever we needed something. After having our meals, he recommended our dessert; which tasted amazing! The dessert was the molten caramel cake (not sure of the exact name, sorry. Lol.) In addition, Sean was good at holding a conversation. It wasnt overbearing or bothersome. Due to this, I had to request seeing a manger to inform them of the great job he was doing. Sean informed us that is at the bar most evenings. Go have you a nice night, enjoyable time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bradenton-3,,,,,
