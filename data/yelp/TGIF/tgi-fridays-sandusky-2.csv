Serena S.,"Mentor, OH",14,15,6,1.0,8/30/2014,"A peach flavored wine was $13. So basically a cheap white wine with peach flavoring. $13. Are you kidding me?! I guess thats why they don't put prices on the menu. Also, a tiny bowl of mac-n-cheese with a few slices of fruit was a kids meal for $8. You're already getting ripped a new one for everything else at the park, is it necessary to rob us because we have to eat? Despicable. Service wasn't that great either. And no Togo service. What's the reason for that?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40
Jen F.,"Galloway, OH",7,35,8,1.0,9/5/2014,Negative one please!!  Wow this place is so overpriced I can't even begin to tell you.  15.00 for a craptastic burger??  Get out of town!!  They do not accept any coupons because they are not a corporate store..  They do not run any specials...  At all.  Oh wait if you count the $5.00 beer special...  Please that's not a special!  Then when you decide you just can't pay the 16.00 for a salad and you choose to leave.  They will charge you for the sodas that they just brought to the table and you didn't even take a drink..  $3.00 a pop!  Save yourself the trouble and go to the Japanese restaurant.  It will be the same price!! And you get good food!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40

Kyle C.,"Des Moines, IA",76,267,,2.0,9/10/2013,"Pricey Fridays. Being a chain I thought the pricing would be close to the others, but it was definitely high.

Mo J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,9,,1.0,6/8/2015,"It's what you expect, regular TGIF, yes it's more expensive than your average tgif, yes accept that as it is, you're paying premium for the convenience of mediocre food instead of the nasty grease overtly sugary stuff you only find in the park.  So it's worth the cost I guess.  Service was horrible though.  Really really really slow service, but I don't blame the bartender, I actually felt bad for them,  (we sat at the bar), I guess it's management's fault for understaffing.  The bartenders seemed way overwhelmed.  I ordered water through our bartender Corey, when I ordered my beer.  The bartender forgot our drinks as the guests who arrive 20 min after we did already got their drinks before we did.  He even said, ""oh sorry, forgot your drinks I'll get that for you"", but got the drinks for the couple next to us first before he finally made our drinks, which by the way the couple next to us ordered drinks way after we did.  We got our food and ate half our meal before we got our drinks, I'd say it was 30 minutes till we got our drinks, and that is not an over exaggeration.  The bartender did forget my water though as I was getting dehydrated.   He checked on us and I asked for water.   Minutes later, I still didn't get my water.   By then we were done with the meal and the other bartender (older english gentleman) checked in on us, and I asked for water and the bill.  The bill came first, water didn't come yet.  I paid the bill with cash and left 30% hoping the high tip would catch the bartender's attention and finally remember my water, but I guess it didn't catch their attention much, because the older gentleman collected the bill, and the water came a lot later than I would have like, (about 10 minutes after we paid our bill).  I understand that it was busy, but asking for water that many times, and treating you nice on the bill, only having to have my water much much later than we paid our bill, leaves me really disgruntled.  It's server 101, to provide guests with water when asked as hydration is an importance to guest experience.  Food came out fast, and it was at the quality that I expected.  Faster than our drinks apparently.   And way faster than my water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40
Christina T.,"Blairsville, GA",10,74,1,1.0,7/7/2012,"I'm writing this after my experience here yesterday and I used to work in the restaurant business.  We got there around noon or 1 wasn't exactly sure what time but it was mid day, walked in with 2 kids and us asked to be seated they said it would be a 5 min wait.... really?! The place was empty. How is going to be a 5 min wait? So we waited though A/C was nice.  We were seated I come over after handwashing with the kids  and he says he ordered us some drinks which is great and a waitress comes up and asks if we want drinks.... uh yes we already ordered them but can you add a couple waters please?  Apparently there was a mix up so they worked it out, the second person came over the girl, and took our food order.  So we go through about 3-4 cups of rootbeer between my kids and my friend who was with us. It was kept refilled bu there was ulterior motive behind it. 35 minutes later in a still fairly empty restaurant we're still waiting.   People after us were getting more food, and more complicated food than us before us.  We ordered, chicken fingers, and 2 sandwiches.  35 min wait, then to top it off, they brought out mine and the kids food, then his about 5 min later, didn't have his sweet potato fries either, and my fries were cold.  I asked to speak with a manager.  As I did one manager walked right by us after they had called for a manager and no one responded... ok douche.  Finally one came out, she was nice and comp'd the males meal, and halved our meals which I was happy with because my fries were cold, and the kids had to wait 35 min I don't know if you sat in a place with kids with that big of an age difference but you can only keep them both happy with similar activities for so long.  Anyways I would not suggest this place again they're overpriced for the shitty service they provide.  We went there for the first time in May and it was actually nice, this time was hell.

Sara B.,"San Jose, CA",12,69,21,1.0,9/26/2011,"Our food came out staggered and incorrect due to the inexperienced waitress being put in a busy section much too large for her skill level to handle well, but she was very nice.  My problem with the restaurant is strictly with the management. We had left our four year old daughter with relatives while we took our older kids to Cedar Point, and I wanted to call her while we waited for our food. There were ""enter"" and ""exit"" doors about 10 feet from our table that lead out to a patio area and was empty, so I went outside to call my daughter. I'd been out there a few minutes talking to her and was about 45 seconds from wrapping up the conversation when a young-ish manager type came out to tell me that the patio was closed and I had to get off the patio immediately. I told him that I had come outside just to make a quick phone call because it was so loud in the restaurant, and I'd be done in just a second. He proceeded to yell at me, telling me that I had I had to get off the patio immediately. His tone was such that my daughter on the other end of the phone started crying. I indicated that I would walk off the patio without coming back into the restaurant, so that I could calm her down because if I had gone back into the restaurant I wouldn't have been able to hear her, and he got even more irate, demanding that I immediately exit the patio via the restaurant. Really, you'd have thought he was a policeman and I was holding a gun given the tone in which he was talking to me. I told my daughter to wait just a minute, and while I walked by this jerk, I told him that if he didn't want people on his patio he should put up a sign to let people know that couldn't go out there. He snarled something at me and I walked through the crowds to get to the outer patio where it took me another few minutes to calm my daughter down.  I've worked in the hospitality industry for decades, and I was appalled at this individual's complete lack of customer service, social skills, and humanity. He struck me as the type of person who would tear the wings off a fly just to watch it twitch. The restaurant would due well to get him far away from any possible contact with customers as he clearly has no idea how to talk to them. This was reinforced when, as the second wave of food was being finished, he approached our table without a care in the world and gave us the same nonsense ""have a great night"" he gave the two tables flanking us. The incident on the patio, yelling at a customer until they were visibly agitated because they'd gone outdoors to call their small child, was so inconsequential to him that he didn't even remember who I was.  As we exited the restaurant, I glanced over at the doors, and there was still nothing posted to let people know that the patio was closed and guests should not exit: just the two doors marked ""exit"" and ""enter.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40

Mark E.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,5,,2.0,6/19/2012,"I don't expect great food at a TGIF, but I expect decent chain food and timely service. When we arrived, we headed over to a table in the bar next to the windows facing the lake. The view is AWESOME. Unfortunately that is the last good thing I have to say about our experience.  We quickly overheard the neighboring tables had failed to get their orders.  Meanwhile, the waiter was busy chatting up one of his female co-workers instead of getting us menus or helping either of the other tables staring directly at him trying to get his attention.  Eventually he went to a neighboring table and was told by the customer he still wanted the cocktail and hopefully the third time is a charm.  The waiter continued to ignore us, strolled back to the bar (presumably actually place our neighbors drink order), but stopped on his way to chat with a group of three other TGIF employees for a couple of minutes.  Customers have obviously been waiting a long time, are complaining that orders are wrong and missing loud enough for us to overhear and the TGIF employees are standing around laughing and chatting.  All in plain view of the customers they are failing to serve. We moved to the bar, away from the awesome view, hoping that the bartender would actually serve us.  Eventually we got the honor of placing our orders.  Of the four dishes we ordered, one was good, one was completely over cooked, dry and chewy, the third was cooked but totally cold, and the fourth was wrong.  It's been a few days so I don't remember what the issue was, but two out of four meals were sent back.  I decided to eat the shoe leather they served me because I was hungry and had no confidence in the second attempt happening in a timely manner, nor did I like the odds of the dish actually being any better. I debated giving the place one star, but gave it two for the proximity to the park, the view and because I will probably give the place one more try in the future.  But it was by far the worst run big chain restaurant I have ever been in and if my next visit is similar, I will drop it to one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=40

In the summer, this place is a madhouse service wise and you are waiting quite some time day or night. In the fall months, the restaurant is pretty busy during the day but at night it simmers down and you can really enjoy yourself. The prices are a bit escalated but that is expected.

I got the half-rack of ribs with French fries. I wanted it with the Jack Daniels sauce too and they were able to provide it on the side.  -Friendly service. Since Hotel Breakers just re-opened, I felt like they were trying extra hard to make it a good experience. CONS: -Prices are a bit higher than your neighborhood TGIF. -They do NOT take any coupons or provide Stripes chips (normally you get free tortilla chips for being a Stripes member). I will say that they DO give you your Stripes points for dining there, though, so that was at least good.  This is the only ""casual upscale"" dining actually IN the hotel (the other two were Perkins, which I'd compare to a Denny's, and Tomo, which is a bit pricier), also.

Charity F.,"Southfield, MI",44,75,102,2.0,9/5/2015,"I hate that we have to give any stars for my dinner. But my star will for lunch and to my servers who were phenomenal they both deserve 5. Fridays is something to brag about at home but its def nothing to brag about out of state lol I came with a group of people came to this location twice. Once for lunch and then later that  same day for dinner.  Lunch was good, but I also did only order chicken fingers and fries. You cant really screw that up, or maybe you lol. This had me feeling more optimistic because i have been to this location before years ago where I had horrible food and horrible service. And if you read the yelp reviews its overall an bad choice. This lunch experience made feel like this location has made huge changes. Maybe it was no management this park season and that they actually care about food quality.  Now lets jump hours later on this same day. While this still wasn't my first choice for dinner this was my only choice since we had stayed in the park until closing time and everything had closed. I came in with good expectations because lunch didn't go bad. Boy was I wrong, the quality of food did a total 180 in the opposite direction. I ordered the Jack Daniel's burger. Its a simple burger with jack daniels bbq sauce on top. You would think this would be easy to make but nope somehow they couldnt get this together. Burger was luke warm at best. The beef  had no type of flavor or seasoning. Not even salt or pepper. The fries weren't even at the same caliber as earlier. Just overall disappointment. I probably should have gotten chicken fingers again but who knows those might have been worse also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Paul R.,"Brown Township, OH",156,308,9,4.0,8/10/2015,"After walking through Cedar Point for 9 hours we were hungry. Checked out one of the restaurants inside the park who were wanting $15 a piece for a chicken strip and fries meal. Yeah right!  We decided to hike over to TGI Fridays located on the beach inside Hotel Breakers. This place is amazing! Okay, so the menu is priced higher than your average TGI Fridays... Big deal, I'll pay a dollar or two more for the beach views and the ambiance of the beautiful hotel the restaurant is located in. Got to think, your average TGI Fridays are located outside cookie cutter strip malls in bumtowns like  Mansfield, Lima, & Erie. Our sever was courteous and prompt, the views from eating on the outdoor patio were amazing, and the food was delicious. Priced higher than average, but much cheaper than buying overpriced crap food inside the park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Debra D.,"Mesa, AZ",20,117,28,3.0,8/13/2015,Well it was a Friday's. The staff here was much better than those employed by cedar pointe ( the crapiest place on earth) I did appreciate that they were in the hotel trying to treat people with kindness and respect.

Bill E.,"Brentwood, PA",85,13,,1.0,2/2/2017,By far the worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant slow doesn't even begin to describe it they were less then eight tables in the restaurant 30 minutes to get potstickers and sliders started off host had no personality seem like an inconvenience when we asked to sit at a different table so we could look out the window and not look at a wall then five minutes for the waiter to appear another 15 and the manager finally came over to take food order and 20 minutes to get the food I guess we were lucky then the other table where it took 20 minutes and I had to point out that they were waiting for a waiter to come by when know when no One had come to that table the manager seemed completely put out and bothered by the whole situation being a platinum member for Cedar point I would rather pay the price in the park for food then to set in a cool restaurant for a little bit away from the crowd thanks for ruining Fridays as a whole two different states bad experiences in bothI wish I could give them a negative start because I would -5 at least. Being so long since gave review and no response from this Friday's or corporate I can safely save this chain cares in no way how guests are treated and there for will never step foot in another Friday's no matter where I am,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Jerrell P.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",0,3,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Labor Day weekend a group of friends and myself visited the in Cedar Point and wanted to grab a bite to eat after hours at the TGI Fridays on site under the impression it would be very similar to other Friday locations we have visited recently. First our waiter greeted us by stating ""Nationally advertised specials are not available here i.e. Endless Apps, Happy Hour all day, and no coupons. Next it's listed on Yelp and on the Fridays website location hours open until 2 am. WRONG! They close at 12 midnight which threw our plans of a nap after a full day at the park off. Service is beyond slow and the staffs attitude sucks. Bartenders eating while working in front of customers, and the prices are extremely higher than other locations. We will NOT revisit this location during the remainder of the stay here at Cedar Park. Too bad for them..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
M S.,"Canton, MI",4,19,4,3.0,5/30/2016,"Pricier than your average Friday's. To be expected seeing that it is on cedar point property. The food was decent, however we felt a bit rushed until it came time to leave. Our server was very busy and hard to get her attention. She was doing the best she could, but we just wanted to pay our bill and get out of there. Took forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Mark S.,"Quartz Hill, CA",0,8,,2.0,8/14/2015,"We arrived around 930 pm after spending a fun day at cedar point. It started out well enough, our waitress was friendly an took our drink order. We received our drinks and placed our food order. That's when things went bad. People that ordered salads did not receive them, drink refills weren't provided and our waitress disappeared. The food orders were incorrect, having the wrong side dishes, at one point one member of our party asked for some bbq sauce for his burger once he received it, he waited and waited while we ate. The manager finally appeared and made things right but the food was only mediocre at best, I've eaten at this chain before and this is my lowest rating,   The value for the price was not there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Jo L.,"Harrisburg, PA",1,5,51,4.0,9/5/2015,"Normally I'm harsh on chains, but your best bet for a dinner salad and evening fun food in Cedar Point is TGIF, in the Hotel Breakers. The pecan chicken salad was fresh and had good balance. Drinks and desserts are super fun for rents and kids, and bachelors who like sweet adult beverages. We loved our waiter, Mike. And the Jack Daniels grill sauce is both nostalgic and taps out your salty sweet cravings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Rob G.,"Miami, FL",378,287,226,3.0,9/30/2015,"Typical Fridays, inside resort hotel on Cedar Point property.  Overall, we had a decent experience.  The service was ok, prices seem to be slightly elevated due to the resort, but to be expected.  The fried shrimp I ordered was fantastic.  I would definitely go back if I was at Cedar Point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,588,1256,2.0,7/25/2011,"This is just a place to go in a theme park that is better than the other theme park food offered. We ducked out here during a storm and had some delicious cocktails! My boyfriend ordered the mojito and I got the tropical berry mojito shaker, they were both good. I'd order that shaker again. The waiter was nice but was missing half the time. In the beginning when it was busy I could understand his absence. But later on the restaurant cleared and he was still missing most of the time. Then we split a patron cosmo shaker and it was a bit too tart, wouldn't get that again. We ordered the Club sandwich and it was really good. The fries were a bit stale and bland but the honey mustard was good and helped out a lot! My Dad got a turkey burger and was happy with it. Overall, this place is overpriced. They don't have the same prices as a typical Friday's because it's owned by the park and they don't HAVE to go with the Friday's pricing. So no happy hour either! Don't expect cheapness. Those fruity drinks were $9 a pop! My mom and Dad got the long island iced teas. Let's just say they were good enough for them to order another after the first! Haha! And both sandwiches cost around $10-12 each.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Faith B.,"Detroit, MI",6,13,,2.0,7/22/2015,"Me and some friends decided to have lunch at Friday's. Well the menu was overly priced, I ordered a turkey burger and a salad.

Carlos L.,"Miami Beach, FL",9,45,,1.0,8/19/2015,"Horrible TGI Fridays.  The front staff is racist.  Two days in a row we came here and we asked for ""booth"".  Both times we were advised ""that section is closed"" and we don't have booths.  Yet, within 3 minutes of being sat the empty booths were then filled.  When this happened a second time we asked for a manager who didn't care. We weren't even offered an apology.  As white patrons walking into a restaurant and being greeted by all African American females it was apparent we were discriminated against because of our color.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Ariel C.,"Plano, TX",89,2,,1.0,7/1/2016,"Horrible, awful service . We stayed at Hotel Breakers and had no choice for dinner  after 10pm but Friday's. We walked in to employees who clearly did not want to be there, when I asked if we could switch to booth the hostess paused and continued to put menus down on table and said to hold on and walked away without ever returning. Waitress was nice but slow. Ordered a $22 appetizer that was burnt pretzels and dipping cheese hardened, way over cooked chicken, and dried out potato skins. We then ordered our dinner and waited over 50 minutes without a word of why it was taking so long while managers walked past us until the waitress said it should be coming out about 2 minutes before. I watched multiple managers walk by the entire time as tables who came in 30 minutes after us got their food, one dressed in blue and one in black, without acknowledging our table or saying anything whatsoever about the wait or how our meal was. On top of it all, the bill with tip was $200 for an appetizer and meals for 4. I will never step in there again, to whoever owns or manages this place you seriously need to step up and do your job because it's a joke. It's just pure laziness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20

Tobin h.,"Elmhurst, IL",101,769,5,1.0,7/9/2015,"Paige was a great waitress overwhelmed by horrible management, pricing, and a greed grab. I get the fact we were sucked in by a tourist trap but really? TGIFridays being so horrible? Overpriced? Miserably portioned? Before this if I had to do a chain restaurant, I thought I could count on TGI's to be reasonable (with guest experience integrity) but this visit makes me want to hunt down an IHOP, Denny's, Chilli's, or Waffle house to use as a go-to. Pretty sure the next trip down 75 between the Midwest and Florida will not include a ""Friday's"". Take your greed in Sandusky and enjoy because my credit card will most likely never include a register of the Friday's experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20
Debi S.,"Vermilion, OH",29,44,1,4.0,8/11/2013,"We went there after visiting Cedar Point. we had not been to a TGIF since we moved from CA 2 years ago.  The waiter was very sweet and interactive with the little one. I had been wanting a Tidal Wave for like 4 years. And TGIF was the only place I knew that made one. I asked him if they had it. They didn't. Cedar Point chooses their menus. But between his and the bartenders efforts they managed to make me one. It was not exact, but very close. and VERY tasty! I definitely applaud their efforts.  The appetizers were quite god. Chips, salsa and spinach dip. I had the Salmon and my husband had the Steak and Ribs, both Jack Daniels style. Delicious! And the tomato mozzarella salad was quite good. The little one enjoyed a plate of chicken and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandusky-2?start=20

Our waitress was great (Xavier), brought us refills without asking, came by multiple times, our drinks came out on time, as did our app, as did our meal. The manager even came by after to ask how things were, we joked with him about the whiney Yelp reviews and told him our service/food was great. I had the sirloin/ribs combo, everything was cooked perfect and tasted good. Our kids loved their food as well. Was it a couple bucks more than the one by our house?

Ok TGI Fridays was busy but im sure this is NOT the 1st time theyve been busy--they should be used to this type of bussiness on the weekend & should learn to be honest so we can not wait & find another place to eat!!!
