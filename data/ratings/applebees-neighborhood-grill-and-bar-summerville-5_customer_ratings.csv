30,Rebecca D.,"Malta, NY",7,85,22.0,4.0,2013-06-29,"Our experience at this Applebee's was pretty good. We were initially put off by the one review here on Yelp, but decided to give it a try anyways. Our server was very friendly, and the Manager was even making rounds to ask everyone how their experience was. He came by our table twice, but not in an intrusive way at all.  The food was as good as one can expect from Applebee's. My wife had a shrimp and chicken skillet that was hot and very tasty, and I had the riblets basket which was also pretty good. We did the special where you get two entrees and an appetizer for $20, and I was actually surprised to see that we got a full order of mozerella sticks. I was expecting like 4 or six since it was a ""special"" but there were probably 8 or 10 in the basket.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again for a quick night out, or to bring a family. We went on a Friday night and the place was not that busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5?start=20,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000005

25,Hana M.,"Charleston, SC",126,221,95.0,3.0,2014-01-03,"Applebee's has the grossest food of any franchise restaurant. This is just my opinion. It's nothing against their summerville location, which i think is brand spanking new, this is just how I feel of Applebee's as a whole and as someone who has been going there for the half price appetizers after 10 since I was about 10.  The best thing on the menu is available after 10 half off - mozzarella sticks. Order anything else and you'll be truly disappointed. Like the Applebee's steak which I once watched my mom eat even though it looked like a tiny black penis.  I have a pic of this somewhere, I'll find it. She said ""it's better than it looks""... And then I had a grilled cheese and tomato soup, the picture in the menu made the grilled cheese look cheesy with 3 different cheese but it was really two giant grilled pieces of Texas toast and a little sprinkling of shredded cheese mix. I didn't think a grilled cheese could ever be done poorly but this one is. I switched it out for the moz sticks.  This is not where you go when you are feelin too lazy to cook but want a good dinner nor is it the place to impress a date, but with their half off appetizers after 10 menu, this is your best late night after bar or after theater food option. Because Applebee's knows that anything tastes good after a certain time if you have had enough liquor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5?start=20,1.612,1.612,1.612,1.612,1.612

I finally walked up to another server at a cash register and stood there for a very long time while she ignored me. Finally, I asked for help and she looked at me like I was a real bother.

37,Romeo W.,"Summerville, SC",1,6,,2.0,2015-03-31,Haven't been to this chain in almost ten years. Tonight's experience reminded me exactly why that is. Service was ok. Waiter wasn't very attentive. We were sat near the servers station. It was pretty awesome to listen to all the gossip of the establishment from various servers who didn't even care to whisper or talk lower than usual. We were entertained at the very least. I got the Mac and cheese with chicken strips. I'm not even going to complain that my dish's temperature was slightly above Luke warm. But the chicken was overly covered in some kind of sweet honey glaze. Which were sat atop the Mac and cheese. The excess sauce found it's home in the warm comfort of the macaroni. The Mac and cheese was overly sweet because of this. Honestly I should of returned it or said something. But the place was such a train wreck I just wanted to leave.

27,Kathy L.,"Summerville, SC",0,2,,1.0,2015-04-02,"I downloaded the Yelp app for the sole purpose of warning the public about this horrible atrocious poor excuse for a restautant. NEVER eat here.  We arrived at 9pm. A party of 9, with 4 kids and 5 adults.  Despite the empty restaurant, we were told by a frantic host that it would be a 20-30 minute wait because there wasn't any silverware. (Wtf)? We would have walked out right then, had we not been to 2 other restaurants that were closing early, and had hungry children.  After waiting for 10 minutes,  I finally worked up the nerve to ask the host to push two tables together. We waited another 5 minutes. I asked the assistant manager what the hold up was. She advised me that they had ""closed that particular section"" but she was doing us a ""favor"" by ""opening"" the section for us. Nevermind the fact that,  throughout our meal, 4 other tables were seated after us in the same section. The food was horrible. I ordered an appetizer trio. The mozzarella sticks were worse than the frozen ones that I get from Costco. The ""brisquet"" nachos had literally 2 shreds of meat on them (not exaggerating), and they tasted like day old iceverg lettuce salad shreds and tomato puree. The last appetizer was Sriracha shrimp.  It was awful. Think: frozen, defrosted, frozen again, and covered in watery Sriracha,  over tasteless cardboard fried chips.  If you are any type of foodie,  (again, this place was our LAST option; real foodies already know to avoid Applebee's), steer clear. The waiter was pleasant enough,  however average. The assistant manager was a dud. I mean really... who closes a section of a restaurant when there is a 30 minute wait, then tells the patron you are doing them a ""favor"" by opening it. No, no, no lady....  0 out of 5 stars... This restaurant exemplifies horrible restaurants. Not only is it the worst Applebee's I have ever been to, it is the WORST restaurant that I have been to in the Charleston area. I would rather starve, eat my 2 year olds muddy sock, and drink rotten milk, before ever eating at that Applebee's again. Do not go there. You have been warned. Seriously. Crap service.

Billy scooped it up sensing my disappointed and I think waited for it to be done properly and stated he'd get me a new one if it wasn't up to my satisfaction.

They were not busy at all and they had 4 managers standing at the end of the bar and you would think they would be Johnny on the spot with the service but they sure missed the spot. We ordered water an a drink from the bar water came out right away but the 1 drink just sat at the bar until 610 pm right near the 4 managers standing at the bar still talking. We ordered the wrap to come out last but came out with the pretzels and burned nachos which she took back to the kitchen only to come back out with the remade nacho and the wrap was cold with very little chicken if there was any in there. We were there for 1 1/2 for as 4 managers stood at the bar talking. 2 waters 1 blue long island Pretzels Burnt nachos Cold wrap Only 1 refill on water after asking for it. We will not return to this unit because each time the are either out of many menu items or serve raw boneless chicken chunks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
11,Kelsi R.,"Charleston, SC",34,6,,5.0,2017-04-07,We just had dinner here and ordered the 2 for 20. We got the mottz sticks which were good and the three cheese chicken cavitappi and it was so great! The grilled chicken had great flavor and wasn't dry at all. Our server Kelly M. was very attentive and had great customer service skills! She even asked if I wanted my daughters food out first! Nobody has asked me that in the past three years of us going out. I never even think to ask and it helped us out a great deal since she eats slower than us. She brought refills quickly and our food came out quite quickly for a busy Friday night. I used to be a server so I critique every server I have and compare them. She is one of the best servers we have ever had! Thank you for a great dinner experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
7,Andrew C.,"Summerville, SC",52,1,,1.0,2017-05-14,"Sat at the bar and the bartender was no where to be found for a good 10 minutes. We weren't asked if we wanted appetizers or anything. We got our food before our silverware and it still took long enough to get that the very slow staff had to go check where it is. I had the bourbon steak which is 2 4oz sirloins, one was medium rare one was medium. The potatoes that come with it were terrible. We weren't provided with sauces or any condiments. My girlfriends broccoli wasn't cooked. Very unsatisfactory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
5,Casey B.,"Harleyville, SC",45,6,5.0,1.0,2017-06-22,"We spent 125.00 tonight at Applebee's. Ordered my father in law food togo. Get home to this. Apparently this is ""coleslaw"" it smells HORRIBLE. It's in two tiny condiment cups. We ordered 2 sirloin steaks, ribs, stir fry, a huge appetizer platter, chicken tenders and bourbon chicken and shrimp. The bourbon chicken and shrimp had 3 shrimp and was bland and had no flavor. So we returned it. It came off the 2 for 25 menue. So they refunded $10.00 in my mind half of $25.00 is $12.50... then get home to realize that the portions we have are 1/2 the size they should've been. That's 3 platter and 2 were made large and they ended up all being the same size so that was a waste of $4.00 for going large. All 3 ended up being smaller than normal portions. We have been regular customers for 3 years and we will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

Their mac and cheese with bacon in it is on point and my waitress was so pleasant and attentive. The food came out super quick and they didn't rush us out of there even with my fussy baby they all continued to awe over and say how cute she was. They also changed a dish to be able to accommodate my vegetarian grandmother which is bonus points for me,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summerville-5,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
