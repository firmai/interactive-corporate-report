10,Anthony V.,"Manhattan, NY",190,144,159.0,4.0,2014-06-09,"This place is really busy, and options are limited in Brownsville. Why I go here: -Drinks: They have pretty good drinks like margaritas: hits the spot after a hard days work -Food: Food is decent, not the healthiest, but there are some healthy options. What's good: They have these automated kiosks that allow you to order drinks, and pay for your check without having to wait.  Whats not so good: When its really busy, its not the cleanest, but I think the staff does their best. Would I go back? yep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
8,Ruth C.,"McAllen, TX",210,440,438.0,3.0,2014-10-01,"It was clean and my sandwich was effing delicious. My friend said his was just okay though. The waitress was pretty attentive at first, but she stopped checking up on us towards the end of our meal. She was training someone though (she told us), so I'll cut her some slack. I'll go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
13,Sofia S.,"Brownsville, TX",0,10,5.0,1.0,2014-10-23,"Bad service! I will never forget. It was on Sunday Oct 12, 2014 at around 8 pm. For five minutes we waited for a hostess there was nobody at our arrival that's were things started wrong since others arrived at the same time we had to make a line... Waiting for someone to write our names down. Then she said it could take up to 30 min to be seated and the restaurant didn't look full at all. She then said you can sit at the bar it's no wait to be seated there ... So we followed and the tables were very dirty it looked like there was only 1 person in charge of all the tables on that section. After 5 minutes we felt very uncomfortable with the dirty table and then no one paying attention to us... So then we finally get seated at the other side but in two separate tables ...yeah it was a Sunday we wanted to eat together as family. After another 5 min no one took our orders to drink the waitress said I'll be with you in a moment. Another 5 min passed and we noticed that people that had been seated probably 15 min. Before us didn't have their drinks. We totally got upset and left!  We wasted more than 30 min of our time with chilis low customer service experience ... Never putting chilis first on the list! Thanks to Texas Roadhouse our night ended way better!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
12,Virginia S.,"Brownsville, TX",2,86,6.0,2.0,2014-12-09,Hadn't been here in 3 years because the food was cold.  Again same problem.  I'm not a child and I like hot food.  The ease of checkout was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
11,Yessica A.,"Brownsville, TX",94,4,2.0,1.0,2016-03-25,"My husband and I went to dinner on March 17 and I ordered chicken fajitas...  Seven hours later, I woke myself up with diarrhea and vomit... I did it twice...  In order to go to work, I've got to take a medication so I couldn't go to the bathroom frequently but, I felt weak after the medicine fade away, so I've had to stay in my parent's house (instead of getting back to my Apartment) so I could get the proper help that I needed... I've tried to eat a couple of oranges for breakfast/lunch/dinner in Friday, because I haven't ate anything during the day... So, I woke up in Saturday having diarrhea and vomit again... My parents took me to the doctor in Mexico ($20 bill) and then the medications ($15 bill) and more Gatorade to keep myself hydrated (another $5 dlls)...  I've tried to reach Chili's and despite that they've responded me through their FB page, but once that I've tried to reach them back, there were no response... So, I headed to the Chili's location to find answers, because I was asking FAIRNESS (meaning like: return what I paid on the dinner -21 bucks-, plus doctor, medications and Gatorade, but one of their ""managers"" told me that they won't do it (just return what I've paid in Chili's cash for future visit: BUT HEY, WAKE UP, I'm totally NOT heading to this location in the future)...  Make yourself a favor and please refrain to go to this location, unless if you wanted to spend your weekend in your bed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
9,Lily U.,"Brownsville, TX",1,68,81.0,2.0,2016-06-10,Terrible service! The food was ok but was cold! I did not return it because I could not get a waiter to come to our table. Never got refills on drinks and had to forever to get our order taken and about 30 minutes to get our check AFTER we asked for it. Very disappointing! Good service will get you a better tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
7,John Tristan S.,"Austin, TX",69,6,,4.0,2016-10-16,Service was surprisingly fast for dining in the bar section. Great beer selection. The chips and salsa are great. Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
6,Melody R.,"Brownsville, TX",1,4,,5.0,2017-03-01,"Lunch here was really good the wait was super fast and the drinks of course are awesome what i really enjoyed the most was the specials that they have for example what me and my husband got was the 2 for 22 and it is cheap and really good it gives you the option to choose from different full size entrees and for a cheap price. I really enjoyed coming here during lunch time because the food was great, delicious and fresh, i ordered the cajun chicken pasta and it thw serving size was big i got pretty full and i even took some to go! What i really enjoyed about this place was also empty, i recommend it to all my family and friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
4,Aaron G.,"Brownsville, TX",0,3,,2.0,2017-05-24,"I understand that they were really busy when we got there, and I haven't had great experiences in the past; but I got a gift card and I needed to use it. We waited 10 minutes to be helped once we sat at the table. The waiter never smiled once while he helped us. We waited another 15 minutes for chips and queso; which was cold and had to be reheated. They brought me the wrong side, and once the right one came, it was undercooked. The waiter did the best he could, but overall it was a lackluster experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
3,Gil G.,"Brownsville, TX",2,59,37.0,4.0,2017-06-09,Drink are really good. Try the margaritas as they have a few house specials. That's about it. Not a food fan here.  I'm more of a purest. Enjoy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
5,Rene P.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-09-18,"The worse chili's I have ever been to. Showed up after football game and we were completely disappointed with the quality of our food. Fries looked as if they had been sitting under heat lamp for hours. Onion rings were reheated in oil to warm them up, tasted gross. Kids frozen pizza was cold. Waiter was so so. Happy to leave never going back. Would only recommend if only restaurant on earth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
2,Luis C.,"Brownsville, TX",0,8,3.0,5.0,2017-10-01,Awesome place to just sit down drink relax and watch the cowboys game..can't get better than this,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
0,Moshi M.,"Brownsville, TX",74,4,2.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"Normally love my experience eating here,  but I noticed that today's burger purchase had been overly salted and uneven in texture,  almost as if 2 different hamburger beef batches were mixed together. Wait staff was new and slow to react.  Maybe I just came on a weird off day? All the second stringers?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
1,Jeffery N.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,20,1.0,1.0,2017-10-09,Brought my son for an after school meal and very disappointed. Food was reheated it seems a few times.... Can't watch tv because I guess watching tv is priority for the staff so they all stand in front of it... I listen to these commercials saying that chilis is revamped... To me same old chilis... lousy menu with lousy service same brownsville...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brownsville-3,,,,,
