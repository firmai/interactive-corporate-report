Francesca R.,"Oxnard, CA",10,13,17,5.0,7/31/2016,"Happy hour all day on Sunday's!  I have a few staple favorites here at Chili's - honey chipotle chicken crispers - southwestern egg rolls - Patron margaritas  & the delectable buffalo chicken salad  I am signed up for their rewards program & received a free dessert email for my birthday a few days ago - I'm glad I chose to go today! Appetizers were cheap due to all day happy hour & tried the peach crumble as my free dessert. Absolutely delicious! I believe it's seasonal for summer, if you like cobblers & summer fruits it's a must try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20
Darleene S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/21/2017,"I haven't been to your restaurant in about 6 months. It was always great food. I love your chicken crispers. I ordered them to go, when I got home and opened the box, what a disappointment! They looked and tasted like the frozen chicken crispers from banquet. What happen to the golden brown juicy crispers? WHY DID YOU CHANGE THEM? Spent money I assumed would be worth it.........?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20
Ashley R.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",8,8,16,2.0,4/3/2016,"Me and my husband went for lunch this afternoon and we left feeling utterly disappointed. We got seated pretty quickly which felt like a good start but then we ordered our food. It took them an hour to get our food out to us. It is very hard to sit there hungry while everyone else's food passes you by.  I was trying to be patient. Maybe they're just taking their time to give us top notch food.  Nope. When our food got to us our order was completely wrong. There might have been a language barrier because English was not our waiters first language.  My husband order ribeye steak and fries and they brought him ribs and rice. Seriously. It would have been funny if we weren't so hungry already.  All that waiting only to get the wrong food.  So we tell them and they apologize, take it away and start on our new order. I got a bacon burger and that came with my husbands incorrect ribs. It was not great. The burger was dry and the fries were cold.  My husbands steak came as I finished my burger and it STILL has rice on the plate. At that point he was too hungry to care. The rice was bland and the steak was over cooked. Obviously rushed.  All around just a bad experience. We waited way too long for below average food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20

Vivian N.,"Ventura, CA",475,495,1742,3.0,8/17/2014,"Chili's upgraded each of their dining table with these fancy little kiosk which probably means that they are doing well so good for them! The kiosk which they call ""ziosk"" allow you to order appetizers, reorder drinks, pay the bill, calculate tips for you, prints the receipt, offers unlimited games for 99c (bejeweled, fruit ninja, etc). Very fancy all together! In terms of food, I almost never stray from the unlimited soup and salad they have. During lunch 12-4pm, it's about 8 bucks but on weekends it's 10 bucks. One soup cup is 3ish and one bowl is 5 so prob worth it if you have an endless appetite for soups like me! My favorite is the chicken enchilada soup which comes with a lot of white chicken meat drenched Ina creamy sauce and shredded cheese (once again, not exactly wedding food diet)  My fiancé tried their trio fajita plate which came with chicken, steak, and shrimp on a sizzling plate. These also sound a tom better than they taste not that they don't taste good but damn that sizzling sound! Deceiving as heck! (15$) Lastly, get the watermelon margarita and you will not be disappointed! Why a three? Well it's a chain and aside from their soup and salad, nothing else special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20
Jasmine R.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",98,136,76,3.0,4/16/2016,"They redesigned their menu for spring 2016, and the new menu options are pretty tasty looking. I tried the avocado sirloin, and to my surprise it was actually really tasty, but it was a bit more on the satire side. Also, apparently they have different avocado sirloins, which I didn't know,  and I unknowingly ordered the wrong one because they decided I picked one over the other... How, I don't know. Luckily, it was still good because I ate it anyways. Lol  The service is good, and on a Saturday night we really didn't have too long of a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20

Mauricio C.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,84,41,1.0,2/20/2016,"Describing my experience at this location is very triggering. How does a waiter who says he's swamped with work have time to sit at the bar with his friends and watch sports? I tried getting his attention to help me figure out why my food tasted like old dry cleaning rags. I don't know what rags taste like personally, but I imagine they taste like the stale tortillas they use for their tacos. The waiters seem to not care about you once you've been served since checking out happens at the table with their little computer pads.  I ordered the three pairing with quesadilla, taco, and enchilada. Three completely different foods and yet all the same disgusting flavor of sadness.  Such a sad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20

Love the appetizer trio with the biter burgers and the egg roles and the boneless honey chipotle wing! Delicious!  For my entree I order a new mango burger which honestly I expected more flavor out it, it looked super good but a little bland, but I also got enchilada a taco and quesadillas which were pretty good but what made it awesome was the chicken enchilada!  My lady got a Cajun pasta which I believe was the best dish we had! Te shrimp made it even bomber! Anyways the device was outstanding and our server was amazing, she offer a lot of things which I loved and it made me feel like she knew me. Our food came out really fast which was awesome!

K. S.,"Oxnard, CA",41,7,,2.0,11/3/2016,"I haven't been very impressed with this Chili's in the past, but they've done some remodeling and updating so I thought I'd give it another shot. I went there with a friend and we decided to try the fajitas. Still not impressed. The drinks we ordered were great. When the food came it was cold. The fajitas were not sizzling like I've seen others in the past. I had to send them back. It was just a disaster.

Hashem N.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,15,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Last Saturday night, my wife and I went to this location on the way home from Solvang. It was our second time that we were there. Last time (though it has been a while) was ok. However, this time the service was really bad. We were seated without much waiting. Music was very loud and with people trying to talk loud to be heard, it was not a pleasant surroundings. The waitress took our order, and while waiting, we played with an IPad looking gizmo that each table had. You can look up menu, pay bills and play games on it while waiting for the food. There was a family next to us and someone there had a birthday. The staff came over and sang a very loud song. Not the usual BD song. They were so loud that a young boy at that table got scared and started to cry. Anyhow the waitress bought wine for my wife and coffee for me. Later the Santa Fe chicken salad arrived. It was spicy, but good.  However, the waitress never came back to refill my coffee, or ask if everything was ok. I had no water either. I ate my meal and waited while burning to see if anything was going to change. It did not. When we got the bill, we had two extra charges on our bill. One was for $0.99 for the game we played on the ""gizmo"". We missed a small print that said there is a charge. We also had a $7 and change charge for something  that we had not ordered. They took that one off, once we told the waitress. Maybe she was overworked. Regardless it was not a good dining experience. I won't be back to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20

It couldn't turn on we literally sat there 20 mins or more we almost felt like walking out but because we out honest people we waited!!! 15 more mins until we had to wave to our server to get his attention!

Alyana M.,"Ventura, CA",0,12,6,1.0,12/18/2016,"I find it really sad when a waitress is trying to diffuse a situation and a manager comes over to make it 10x worse. I ordered the endless soup & salad. After a 10 minute wait & I still had no recieved the refill of my Sprite. I had about 1/3 bowl of soup left when i asked for another, the waitress declined citing the GM would not allow 2 bowls of soup to be on the table at once. (?) I asked a passing waitress to send over the GM. The GM Jesus came over and was extremely rude and did nothing but argue about how people dont pay for their soup. He acted as if I was asking for him to bring me something I wasnt entitled too as I ordered ENDLESS soup & salad. I then stated I still have yet to recieve my refill I asked for 10 minutes ago, in which he said ""well she is busy"". He refused to accept any sort of responsibility or apologize for the situation. Overall, was very dissapointed as I do go to this chili's frequently and have never been treated this way before. Also, other mangers I have encountered there solved any problems I had instead of acting as if I was inconveniencing them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20
Kayluh D.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,31,7,3.0,5/29/2016,"Seated seated in a decent amount of time. Restaurant was clean. Our server was decent. My complaint here was that I ordered a side house salad, and asked if chicken could be added. I assumed an up charge for protein, I saw 2.00 up charges on other salad options, of which I had no problem with. Server NEVER said anything about an astronomical Sur charge. Never even mentioned a price or t. Received bill...my like 6$ salad became a TWELVE DOLLAR SALAD. I was up charged almost 6 dollars for chicken!!! 6$!? I would hope that the sever would have had the decency or TRAINING to inform customers about pricing options when they ask for something different than what was posted. A side house salad for near 12 dollars!? With that surprise coming only when going to pay the tab....ridiculous! ! I would have NOT asked for chicken , or ordered something else. Heck, I would've took a paired down size of chicken.  Was the salad good? Yes. I had no complaints.  My complaint here is being transparent with your customers on pricing, instead of making it hidden. Should I have asked? Probably. But seeing 2.00 up charges for protein,  I was assuming it would be along the lines of that. Just ludicrous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=20

Just don't know if I can eek out 4 stars.  I met some friends here who were celebrating. They ordered one of the specials (I didn't get the name of it bit did get a picture) and I ordered their Texas fries. My friends' food was delivered very quickly, it smelled delicious and was served hot. WIN. They both said the food was really good, except the jalapeño sausage (?) was VERY hot (their words). Corn was good, too.  My order came a bit later and I was surprised at how good it was, too. Hot. Melted cheese. Bacon bits. Pretty darn good and for the price it was about what I expected.  Service was basic. Very basic. Nothing made this trip spectacular or memorable, or makes me specifically want to eat here again.

Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1403,10421,3.0,3/14/2017,"I had an okay visit to this Chili's last week.  Good for them I'd forgotten about my previous review and the bad experience I had.  This time things were not so slow, service was good, I was able to visually locate the host stand immediately upon entering the restaurant, but my order wasn't right.  I asked for the Caribean salad without onions and with dressing on the side.  I got this, but they also removed the dried cranberries, the sesame seeds and did the cilantro on the side.  The salad was still good but it would have been much better with the dried berries & seeds on top like it should have had. When I noticed the oversight our server wasn't readily available to ask for these things so I just ate it as-served.   Our server was enthusiastic and had a great attitude.  Food was a little slow but not too bad and it was a busy dinner night.  Portions are big, food is decent quality and everything was hot and fresh this time.  I'd come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard

John M.,"Signal Hill, CA",4,17,1,1.0,6/13/2017,This chilis is always a disaster. Tonight. My Family ordered chilis for dinner. We had Grubhub deliver. I've been ordering chilis for years. After several issues from missing food to the food that was ordered and burnt. Tonight's food was the worst food I've ever had. The boneless buffalo wings were so dry and over cooked that I have decided I will never come back to Chilis. ( we have ordered chilis 2-3 times a month for the past 2 years. This was the last straw.

Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4297,3.0,1/4/2016,"I remember back then, while as a child... Coming to Chilis was super cool- it was definitely a nice upgrade from Sizzler's. Remembering how it was back then, it's nice because the food quality and overall vibe it's still very much the same as before as if they've stayed consistent and have even gotten better by adding on better and move food options. Although being corporate, Chilis has many options to satisfy the enchilada lover to the steak lover. I was surprised on my last visit at how many options they have added, that aren't necessarily the traditional dishes they are known for.  Chilis has a wonderful happy hour menu, so if you're thinking of a fun place for HH, Chilis is the place for you. They have new appetizers (please refer to my pics) that are always changing. I loved the loaded fries add steak, delicious! My hubs and I order a few rounds of their signature margarita; mine extra, extra spicy of course. The prime rib meat option for the fajitas was not thaaaaat great, if anything the meat was dry. On the other hand, the shrimp was juicy and had flavor. I'd have to say that the boneless loaded chicken appetizer was delicious, and not what they traditionally offer at Chilis, try it!  The service here is pretty standard. The servers provide just the right amount of customer service without being overly phony, that's nice.  There's a pretty huge, well-lit parking lot in front of the restaurant, so finding a parking spot shouldn't be a problem.  Am I returning customer? Sure, I would consider myself one... but I'm still on my journey to support small business and rep' for the many ma n' pop shops around town...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard

I ordered a small salad, then I ordered a chicken fajita.  After several bites, I bit down and felt something in my mouth that was hard and non-food like.  I took the object out of my mouth, and found a thumb screw, measuring about an-inch-and-a-quarter.  What was a thumb screw doing in my fajita?  How could that possibly happen? Had I swallowed the screw, God knows what could have happened to me, or what type of surgery and recovery I narrowly escaped.

This a great place for celebrating any occasion. They have updated alot from tablets to order or checkout,the interior design and menu as well!

It was pretty good and cooked to the doneness I had asked for. Came with brocolli and mashed potatoes. Boyfriend had the bacon burger and we shared the onion ring appetizer. It did take a while for the food to come out so we ended using the tablet to play a free trivia game. When we looked at our itemized bill on the tablet we noticed the games are not actually free.    Overall it was a good lunch, but we weren't in a hurry that day.

The way to do it is come here in pairs, and you can order two entrees and an appetizer per pair ($20). Some of the entrees we got were 6 oz steak, mango chicken, and ribs. Luckily, my family has six, so we got three of those combos ($60 total). Family really loved the food, and playing trivia on the little tablet at the table.

Miho B.,"Oxnard, CA",83,40,58,1.0,5/8/2016,"I am very disappointed of the quality of the food we got tonight. First, the chips was so oily it looked like it's been sitting there for a while. It was really nonappetizing. We only ate a few pieces and had to leave the rest. The mini salad also tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge. The cucumbers wete half frozen.  The ribs barely had any meat on the bone. They didn't bring any wet wipes with the ribs so we asked one but the wipes didn't come to us until 10 minutes after we were done eating. It was very uncomfortable to keep sticky fingers throughout the meal. Finally, the mountain chocolate cake was not even warm. It is supposed to be warm and melting inside, but the chocolate fondue inside was cold and solid, not melted. Overall the meal was the worst course we've ever had. I'm so disappointed.

Me M.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,5,,2.0,2/4/2016,"I went with a friend to celebrate his birthday.  We arrived at 11:15 to avoid to lunch hour rush. It was pretty empty when we arrived, yet it took a while for us to actually get seated.  We were seen by staff, just not welcomed or approached & left standing in the entry way. I actually thought we had to seat ourselves... So we get seated and we tried to order Mimosas (my friend's favorite drink) but were told they had no champagne (disappointing).  Then they had no bananas for the straberry-banana margarita I wanted.  Again, disappointing but we moved on. My friend had wine, I settled for a regular blended strawberry  margarita.  We asked for water with our drinks and were only  brought 1 glass.  We had to flag our waiter down and ask for another glass of water because he rushed off when he dropped off the first glass.  Ugh... It took longer for our food to arrive but when it did it was just ok. I ordered the quesadilla combo (on the lunch menu) and a house salad.  I got no fries and the portions were very small.  The house salad you actually get looks NOTHING like it does on the menu.  It comes in a cup, not a plate.  And, because its sooooo small, there are very few greens.  Disappointing. We told our waiter we were celebrating my friend's birthday and we were actually asked if we wanted them to bring a scoop of ice cream and sing to the birthday boy.  Why ask if we already told you we were celebrating???? It's suppose to be a surprise!  Our waiter also assured me that the manager would be removing the charge for the ice cream from our bill.  She did not.  No biggie but why tell me she would if she wasn't going to?    We should have gone across the way to Friday's instead.  Next time we will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=60

Edgar P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,9,4,3.0,1/10/2015,"Not sure why some are complaining about the Ziosk, this is actually a plus.  It expedites the process of paying and ordering of drinks and dessert, you don't have to spend hours waiting for the waitperson, wait for the receipt, then wait for the card to clear, or wait for the person to order desert.  Everything is on your table.  And if you don't want it, just put it aside don't use it.. Meal for two for $20.00 is a great deal,  Go to TGIF and you will  not find anything similar.  I also like the way they honor veterans, with their 10% discount.   Sure, waiting time is long, but only on certain days like weekends.  But try going to other place and you will realize that this is nothing abnormal for that day and time.  On a normal day, there is almost no waiting at all. Waitpersons are actually friendly and will assist you with whatever you need, just ask!

The first thing we noticed was that you get less at Chili's than you do at Friday's.  At Friday's you get a shared appetizer, a main course and a shared desert.  At Chili's you get a shared appetizer and a main course and that is it.  They did not seem to have a whole lot of a selection on the special menu to choose from...it is very limited in what you can get.   The service was decent...nothing to write home about but it was not horrible.  At the time we came in to get dinner there were not a whole lot of customers in the building and it seemed like maybe our waitress had more tables than she could handle.

My husband ordered the ribeye.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich.  At this point my husband ordered the patron margarita.   The manager brought out our appetizer.  Which was good.  I think it was the best part of the whole meal.  Another lady brought out our entrees and my husbands patron margarita.  My food wasn't good nor bad.  Just an average buffalo chicken sandwich. My husbands food on the other hand was no where near edible.  The steak was so incredibly salty.  Another patron to the side of us ordered the same thing and also had the same complaint.  The broccoli was bland.  The best thing on his plate was the potatoes.  He only ate about 1/3 of his meal. His margarita was also watered down just like my daiquiri.   We only saw our server when the order was placed, to bring out our drinks, right before she dropped the check to ask if we needed a box to which my husbands response was ""it wasn't worth it"" and when she dropped off the check.  And she didn't even bother coming all the way around the corner to do so. This was the last straw.  So we asked to speak to the manager. He didn't apologize or even acknowledge the lousy service or food.  He just comped the appetizer and went on about his way.  He wasn't very friendly either.  You can tell why the service sucked, it trickles down from the top.

Ty S.,"San Francisco, CA",337,7,43,4.0,4/6/2010,"Chili's has always been on the fence with my preferences. Personally chain restaurants don't impress me very often and at previous Chili's dining experiences I've been very disappointed to say the least.  However, tonight after being hungry for hours we settled as a last resort on our old acquaintance of Chili's. As I said I was hungry, and so were the other diners I was with. I wanted something that was going to fill me up and not leave me hungry an hour later like many chain restaurants do. So on the bill was:  1.) SOUTHERN SMOKEHOUSE BACON BURGER With maple bacon, smoked cheddar, mayo, crispy onion stings and ancho-chile BBQ sauce. ""Wow that is some really good bacon"" This burger was phenomenal. It's one of their newer items and my mom was glad she ordered it. Quite the guilty pleasure worth of nutrition - As Served it has 2080 calories.  2.) CLASSIC BACON BURGER A crowd-pleasing favorite topped with apple wood smoked bacon, cheddar, red onion and mayo. A burger is a burger. My sister said it was a little dry, but she's easy to please.  3.) For my quest to get a filling meal I ordered the MARGARITA GRILLED CHICKEN Classic Margarita-flavored grilled chicken with hints of lime and citrus, served with rice, black beans, tortilla strips and house-made pico de gallo. I told our honest and very attentive waiter no tortilla strips though. AND...it was freakin' good! The chicken was tender and flavorful. The beans and rice as a bed to the chicken were cooked and complemented chicken very nicely.  4.) Chili's Mango and Blackberry Iced teas are very flavorful as well as their what seemed to be fresh Strawberry Lemonade (with real strawberry seeds floating around!!!) Anyways, the bill was around $40 for a meal that I wasn't expecting much out of from past dining experiences with the restaurant.

For our appetizer, we had the onion rings.  I'm not a big fan of onion rings in general, but my boyfriend enjoyed then.  My boyfriend ordered the sirlion steak, which was tender and well seasoned.  I'm not a big red meat eater and I was enjoying the deliciousness of the meat.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, which came out pipping hot on a hot plate.  The chicken was not seasoned and quite bland, but with the toppings included (i.e. cheese, sour cream, guacomole, lettuce, tomatoes, onions) was edible.   I believe that, given the choices on the menu for the $20 for 2 deal, the place is worth trying again.  I may even go for a sirlion steak this time.  That's why the food deserves a star rating.  However, the service deserves two starts.  A long wait time and unfriendly waiter made the experience unpleasant.  Isn't that a big reason why someone goes to a restaurant anyway? Oh yeah, and Chili's does serve actual chili for all you curious people out there!  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=80

This one was darker than nacho cheese and had chunks in it (I think either ground sausage or beef)....  Not bad, but not great...    For lunch we ordered off their seasonal menu....   The Green Chile Hatch Burger was first up...  Really good.. not really spicy at all, but I think Chili's burgers are pretty good for a restaurant chain...     I liked the green chile sauce they put on the burger...   The beef tasted really flavorful as well...  Next up we had the Bacon Chicken Ranch quesadilla.    This was pretty good as well...  At first the portion size seemed pretty small, but with the chips to start us out with, it was perfect...   and very tasty as well! The service was excellent... Our drinks always full, and when we polished off the first basket of chip they offered us a refill of the chips and salsa (not the cheese)....   I thought that was pretty nice...

Let me just say, ""Big Improvement""! We walked in and the hostess actually asked us our preferences for seating! We were seated almost immediately and our server was great.

Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",289,180,569,3.0,12/12/2009,"When I think of Chili's I think of a very fun restaurant!  I have been seeing their commercials for years & I always think of their Chili's symbol and baby back ribs  because of their very catchy song,  ""I want  my baby back, baby back, baby back, I want my baby back, baby back, baby back Ribs"" I would categorize their food as American/Tex-Mex. There is a lot of sandwiches, burgers, and Tex-Mex inspired food. I actually like their food, but I would like it a WHOLE LOTE MORE if it was less salty. I personally think that people who really love their food have to have deadened taste buds. Their flavor is not intense, its just salty. Often times I order their food telling the waiter to tell the food preparer NOT to add more salt on my fries or not to use their season salt.  I have been to about four different Chili's locations in California and one in Hawaii and realized that the saltiness is consistent from one Chili's location to another.  What I DO LOVE about Chili's is they have GREAT drinks! Oh, their drinks are super yummy and I love that they are colorful and fruity, just how I like them. Yes, they are girly, but they get you buzzed so it still works its wonders. Chilil's is not my first choice, but I would go to Chili's for drinks, appetizers & if the line for other restaurants were long.  I think they could improve their menu with some more grown up dishes because I feel they have a lot of ""fast food"" like items.

Where is the seating rotation ?? The service was very slow. We ordered 15 minutes into being sat. We watched as the other tables that came in after us ordered their food and then received their food before us. Not to mention our server forgot one of the side dishes we ordered. We had to leave before we got to even start eating due to an emergency and I will say the staff was really quick with getting us our to-go boxes and our check. Because we had to leave so fast we did not review the bill and completely forgot out the Mac n cheese we ordered that we never got.

Ignacio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,148,39,2.0,11/18/2010,"I am actually surprise to see the amount of fair reviews this restaurant is getting. Now the food is ok, not good to the point that every city needs a Chilis! I went with my coworkers to have dinner after we were done with one of our classes. I was actually underwhelmed with the menu, I though the selection was not that extensive. I just saw salads, burgers, and chicken, the usual things you expect in a chain restaurant!  I had the tortilla soup and the triple dipper.   Again, the food was ok, I'm not going to say it was nasty because, that my friends, would be a lie. One thing though, don't order boneless chicken pieces, I don't know, just the though of chicken not having bones gives me chills, I mean chickens are ment to have those things in their bodies, so let's accept them in our plate. The food tasted really how can I say it.... Very mass market! The location is horrible, right in the middle of what seems acres and acres of parking!!! There is no view what so ever, but the view of thousands of cars, and if looked at the other side you see WalMart, so in reality you don't get the best experiAnce. Service was slow, and also I did not appriciate my drinks being poured in a plastic cup, cmon, let's give the consumers more credit. Beer options are also not that great. They either have (domestics) bud light (imports) corona, very typical beer. There was no micro-brewery option! For what I ate, I don't think it was worth it, I don't know that's just me. I guess this restaurant serves its purpose, being right off the 101, it caters to passing visitors. The view, the feel, the decoration, it's ment to move people as fast as possible (just eat and leave), I don't think it was build for the local population.

Overall, the food isn't really too bad for the price you're paying.  The soup was warm, not piping hot, so that was a disappointment on a rainy day.  Also, this lunch special is billed as the ""Express Lunch.""  Considering how slow our server was and how empty the restaurant was, the ""Express"" part of that lunch was vastly overrated. I don't regularly eat at Chili's, so I probably won't be back.  But for under 7 bucks before tax and tip, it's not too bad of a lunch.  I just prefer other types of food at non-chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=100

Rookie? Maybe I'm being harsh, but would have loved to give him a 5 min crash course on how to make good money as waiter. It's really easy, your customers should never need anything, think ahead and give them your undivided attention. Don't try to take there order by memory then ask them to repeat it as you write it down, (yeah he did). I have a 3 strikes rule and that's strike 2 at this Chilli's. Probably my last time there.

Paulie G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,65,,1.0,5/12/2012,"Please bear w/ me as I'm very analytical and believe that limited detail might not suffice. I had a rather multitude of problems last night at this location. Similarly, my guest and I were quite perplexed how things were handled as well. Quick version (store #588) turned into a business training and an unsolicited scolding from your Manager Julie Carpenter. In the beginning,  I clearly and politely told bartender Danielle, when we ordered, ""that I was not in a rush""! Drinks were fine...appetizers fine....yet meals were delivered way too fast! I felt pressured to finish the appetizers, so this is not good service attention to detail. Danielle removed my plate then both servers ignored us for a good 20 minutes. I had pushed the appetizer plate forward, showing we were finished, and then watched the poor service prevail. Both servers passed by multiple times...yet couldn't comprehend my dinner was waiting. Similarly that my guest was barely eating...as she was waiting for my dinner to arrive. When Danielle finally and disinterestedly showed up...I explained to her the problems. I was never vulgar....rude....or abrasive...thought provoking...YES!!! I'm there as the customer and shouldn't have to ask her to serve me...this is what I said. From that moment on...we were the plague.  Manager (Julie Carpenter) approached us in a very abrasive fashion and barked at me (paraphrasing) ""what did you do/say to my server? She's in the backroom crying?"" This was 25 minutes after the initial conflict. I spoke to Julie for probably 20-25 minutes....as she was QUITE accusational and said ""I'm the Mother here and those are my girls!!!!"" Why does this matter? There was so many comments that were exchanged during this session..I just can't type them all out! Julie remained very accusational...seemed more concerned w/ how hew staff's feelings were tarnished...and wasn't very concerned w/ me writing a negative review!  Later when asked for Julie to return...she refused. Both bartenders ignored us til later...and were in close proximity probably 20 times+++ 2nd bartender Erica thought they were giving us '10 out of 10' service??? Now... after a 20 minute session w/ their manager....mind you filling up waters and asking for another drink or napkin was like a root canal...I merely chimed in and said, ' more like a negative 5.' Sooooooo.....glutton for punishment....we stayed and did something unmentionable....ORDERED ANOTHER DRINK!!! Erica heard our version....made a decent attempt to counter the bad taste....and we closed up our tab. Erica said that Julie would NOT come out for 2nd visit....seemingly odd? And left over a 20% tip after being scolded and ignored....? Not to be discarded, but definitely a valid point, we watched half of the kitchen crew and bartenders remain in the backroom for over 5 minutes. Consoling an upset worker this way does what.....IGNORES YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! Especially when an opportunity to 'make things right' was suggested by me!!! So....I'm a HUGE fan of poor/indifferent service given by staff that exercises bad choices deserves retribution! The pen IS mightier at this point...and I think this establishment STILL doesn't understand what they did wrong and take the ownership for their errors!!! With that....I'd say a revenue loss of $300+ per month might make my review scar! This is what the service world has come to... get mad at your patrons when they complain....and seek false & gravely invalid comfort from your co-workers...who coincidentally deliver that same inferior service and attitude....sad sad sad!  Sometimes the real challenge is to make a bad service situation turn into a 'lifetime' customer....once Chili's Supervisors figure this out...please contact me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=100

But as soon as we got to our table our server took 15 minutes to come and greet us and ask us for our drinks. As soon as we order drinks we ordered chips and salsa. So 10 minutes pass and she brings us our drinks but no chips. So we figured they would be right out. Well we were wrong. She completley forgot about us . She took other peoples orderes and what really pissed me off was that a family that came in after us got there drinks faster and they got there chips before us. So 20 mins passed nnd we finally called her over and told her we r ready to order. Once we finished ordering. My husband asked were are our chips. She says oh i forgot. SHE FORGOT ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! it took 10 mins after we told her to get put chips. And another 30 mins to get our food. Well  when our  food came it was okaii. But to see familys come in after us get better treatment was really messed up. I didnt get the waiters name but she was really chubby and white.

I came to eat here on 3/3/11 with my 2 boys for dinner and while I was waiting I told the hostess please can you tell my server it is my son's birthday, as I wanted it to be a surprise for him.... long story short... I was seated way in the back by the restrooms and opening to the kitchen, my server seemed like she was lost in another world, my rasberry ice tea tasted like plain ice tea, the 2 for $20 chicken fajitas had more peppers and onions than actual chicken, my younger son's kids pizza was undercooked and soggy looking....  so after eating we sat around for a while... waiting for the birthday hoorah, waited some more,  the bill came.....I paid it.  Then I was like, Ok I guess we are not getting a birthday hoorah afterall.. So as I was walking out I confronted the hostess and expressed my disappointment about this whole darn birthday thing.  Seriously her excuse was ""oh I'm sorry, I forgot to tell her"".... What kind of people are they hiring here!!  Is it too much to ask to sing happy freakin birthday to a 13yr old kid for crying out loud, are you that lazy at your hostess job that you couldn't relay a single sentence to the server.....  I knew I should've went somewhere else...

Corey R.,"Oxnard, CA",13,17,,4.0,4/17/2011,"It seems like I'm in here at least a few times a year. I always look through the menu, not so much to decide what I want as much as to make sure my usual order is still on it. When walking in, there is usually a host to greet you and hold the door open. A hostess greets you and, in my experiences, usually seats me right away. If I happen to go during a rush, I don't think I've ever waited more than 20 minutes. The hosts and hostesses are always friendly and smiling, even when the customers are not so nice. The one or two times when I was there during a rush, service was a little slow all around, but I'd expect there to be some lag when every seat is occupied; the kitchen does not expand when there are more people dining. But during one of my normal visits the servers have been courteous and prompt. A few servers have even let us know not only their name, but also the name of the other servers who will be covering our table with them. Drinks tend to show up within 10-15 minutes after being seated. If an appetizer is ordered, it tends to arrive within another 5 minutes. A few minutes after the appetizer is finished the entrees arrive. The food is usually still steaming when it hits the table. I have had one or two times when I didn't need to wait for the food to cool before eating, but it was still hot enough for my liking. Overall, a consistently decent place to go for a meal that will fill you up without breaking the bank, as long as you don't terribly mind that this is a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=100
