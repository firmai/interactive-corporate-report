83,Beth S.,"El Mirage, AZ",141,485,17.0,3.0,2012-03-05,Just another average visit to Red Robin. The service staff is still just ok and the food is the same as it always is. I would love for them to wow me sometime and I guess that's why I keep going back; because I am hoping that THIS VISIT will be the WOW visit and I won't have to keep coming back. At some point my brain is going to have to tell my heart that it's just not going to happen and I should spend my money elsewhere but I don't see that happening anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=140,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

This RR location is conveniently located right across from the Peoria Sports Complex, making it a great spot to grab some food and drinks before seeing my San Diego Padres show off their skills during Spring Training.   While RR is known for their burgers (and they looked really good!), I chose the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  Maybe this wasn't the best idea.  The first half was very tasty, with a nice balance of chicken, parmesan and caesar dressing all wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  However, the second half was lacking a key ingredient - the chicken!  It was bite after bite of lettuce.  Lettuce, lettuce, lettuce.  I should have ordered a burger.  I consoled myself by continuing to consume fries.  Glorious fries. The staff is friendly and attentive - our waitress Jazmin took great care of us - fry basket and beer glasses were never empty.  I would have mentioned the lack of chicken in my wrap, but after all those fries, it really didn't matter.  I am sure she would have corrected the issue though, with a smile. Friendly staff, fries (!) and the proximity to my Padres will convince me to give RR another try before Spring Training ends.  And this time, I will order a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=100,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

There are definitely better places in the Valley to get a burger, especially in the $9 price range, and especially since the rarest they will cook one is with just a little pink. However, this is a good place to go with a group, and you can't beat the bottomless fries (try the garlic fries).

127,D. D.,"Peoria, AZ",8,92,36.0,2.0,2012-07-23,"Went last week for my daughter's birthday. We've been to this one a hundred times, but this time our service was less than stellar. Actually it was less than standard. Our waitress must have been new... When it was time to ask us if we wanted dessert, we told her it was our daughter's birthday and she said something about that and ran off. Ummmm...don't you normally ask the other 5 people at the table if they want something? Or were we all supposed to share the birthday sundae??? I guess we shouldn't complain. At least RR gives a bday sundae. Food this trip was good, as usual. I love the California chicken sandwich, but for the life of me, can't ever get through the whole thing without it falling all over the place. It is deceivingly well-wrapped when it arrives, but then goes to hell after the first few bites!  Has anyone noticed the amount of fries you get (in the unlimited baskets) averages like 6-8? Inevitably, we ask for at least another 2 baskets while waiting for our food to be cooked. What's up with that? Would save time if they just brought more to begin with AND give us one less thing to complain about. As we predicted, it took a LONG time to pay.

134,John P.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,161,11.0,2.0,2012-07-26,"I often want to shy away from criticizing companies that  mess up gluten free offerings because it's so easy for them to decide it's not worth it and remove them altogether.    That being said...   If you pay an extra $1 to have an item that will stop you from feeling like death for a few hours it would be nice if it your burger was between it. Should that part be messed up  then it wouldn't just be taken away,  swapped over, and then given back now that the meats cooled and a lot of the juices/ additions were stuck to the old bread. it's not as appetizing as it sounds. How about offering to remake it, a new fresh burger just like the one we paid for?   The fiery Jolokia burger is nowhere near as fearsome as it should be. E.G., it's lower than a raw habanero which is not what I was looking for which is a damn same as it really tastes great  and should I ever want to blend up a burger to feed to a small child I'll keep it in mind. I'm as harsh to a company proportional to their claims of  how spicy they claim their food is.  Overall this location gets a 2, the burnt to hell coffee that came out on the first attempt should get you a 1. In their defense the ""fresh"" pot was nearly as acrid so it's hard to think that there's not some cost cutting on coffee occurring but most places that late in the day ask me if it's ok to wait while the make a new pot, not give you whatever's stuck to the carafe at the time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=100,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004

I tend to be one of those weird people that likes a medium burger (or med/rare if I know the place grinds their beef on site). And the burgers always tasted overcooked to me.

We attended this location last night and it was the 2nd time in a row we walked up to the hostess stand and all hostesses had there backs toward us gossiping, my fiancé had to interrupt them to get there attention and seat us.  The first thing a customer does is walk threw the doors and be greeted, and if that cant be done right the rest of the experience will be negative.  So uncomfortable feeling like we were interrupting there chat session. After we sat down and ordered we watched our onion rings, along with the tables behind us, and another short stack sit under the heat lamp for a honest 15 minutes. After being under the heat lamp for so long there were finally brought to our tables.  Cant speak for the table behind us but they received their appetizer 1 minute before there entrée. Which I would have complained on right then and there. Our appetizers were under the heat lamps for way too long for people not to recognize to run them to their tables so we could have enjoyed our apps in a timely manner.  My fiancé and I were not pleased AT ALL. The only reason this review has 4 stars is because our sever was a SUPERSTAR. His name was Kyle and he made the entire experience 10 times better for us.

135,Leanna A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,142,106.0,1.0,2014-12-02,"I really have experienced better. One of the slowest and most awkward meal services I've had in a while...  We came here this past Sunday, and the place was really busy-- I'll give them that. We were seated immediately, by someone who I presumed was a manager, and they told us our server would be right with us. Ten minutes later, the same manager came over and said that our server was too busy inputting orders for another table so he would take our drink order. As per their menu, I asked if they had Minute Maid Light Lemonade, and the manager-esque person flat out said no. I would have appreciated an ""I'm sorry, we're out"" or something, but I just got a ""no."" I'm not sure if this had to do with incompetence or just laziness, but that was my first strike. I ended up ordering soda water and my boyfriend got Dr. Pepper. When I ordered soda water with lime, the same guy said ""wow, that's weird..."" Ok....? I didn't care what he thought of my drink selection, but I was more appalled at the way he was presenting himself. After he brought us our drinks, he asked is we were hot. The restaurant was significantly chilly, so we said no. He proceeded to say ""well I'm hot,"" and then walked to the wall and adjusted the thermostat. I was thinking to myself, no shit you're not, you're running around a busy restaurant... but whatever.  Our server finally came to the table. No greeting, no introduction, she just asked what we wanted to order. We started with an order of mozzarella sticks, and said we weren't ready to order our entree. She came back two times while we were looking at out menus and asked if we knew what we wanted yet. Needless to say we felt rushed. Once we had decided, I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup with a side of broccoli, and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and fries.  45 minutes after ordering the mozzarella sticks, they decided to come out. They were good. Not the greatest I've ever had, but very consistent with Red Robin quality. No complaints there other than the time it took to move the food out of the window. While eating the sticks, we ran out of drinks and they were not replenished until after our food was delivered. Additionally, I asked the server 2 times for an extra side of limes and she never brought them to the table until the third time when my boyfriend asked and she finally delivered them after our entrees were brought out.  Probably about 30-35 minutes after the mozzarella sticks came out, our food was delivered. I really don't think it takes that long to pour a ladle of soup into a bowl and steam some broccoli, but apparently Red Robin thinks so. Anyhow, my soup was lukewarm. The cheese ontop of the bread in the soup made up about half of the soup's volume, and because the soup was no longer hot it was the consistency of bubble gum. I picked it out. My broccoli was delivered separately, about five minutes after, and without a fork. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a fork from the server, and by that time the broccoli was cold too. The fish and chips came out fine, with the exception of the server dropping one of the strips off the plate and having to bring another one a few minutes later.  Overall, this 2 and a half hour dining experience could have been much more enjoyable, espcially considering that many tables around us that were seated after us with larger parties were attended to better and quicker than we were.

It was not cod.  It was closer to tilapia in texture and taste.  The manager kept insisting they only stocked cod. I grew up eating seafood on the coast and cod has a distinct flavor.  It wasn't old cod which would have had an old ""fishy"" taste.  It was some other species of mild tasting white fish and it was old.  The fryer oil had not been changed so the crust was greasy.

I decided to go with the guacamole bacon burger and added an over easy egg.  My burger was cooked just fine. The only downfall to this guacamole burger is that I didn't taste any guacamole. I looked at my burger and there was a very thin layer of guacamole spread on top of the bun but was covered by a bunch of lettuce. With all the different toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bacon it was sad that I couldn't taste the main ingredient and the actual component that the burger is named by which is the guacamole.  The fries were good and tasted better with the salt seasoning- that is your choice to use or not on the table.  Donuts were ordered to our table for dessert. The donuts came with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces and was covered in sugar. It was good but definitely too sweet for my palate.

Not only did we enjoy the food(which was actually 100% correct and perfectly done this time), but we had a great time and enjoyed our overall experience. In recent visits, we have had many complaints and issues, so bad that we've debated ever going back here. Since we were getting free food anyways, we figured we would try again. Melissa was amazing. She was on top of our bottomless fries refills, rootbeer float refills, and even noticed we didnt have napkins or silverware and brought those to us before we even noticed. She was very busy, had so many tables, but she still took such good care of us. The other servers should take notes from Melissa, she is the best server we have ever had at Red Robin.    Only a couple of small issues to bring to managment attention: 1.) No light on our booth, light above us was blown. It was difficult to get good lighting for birthday pics 2.) The food took a little long to get to us, but we were in no rush, it came out hot and fresh, and was all correct. 3.) One of the female servers who is alittle on the plus size( no shame in that as I am as well), had the back of her shirt pulled up, showing her back side and slight underwear showing. Maybe an undershirt would he helpful? 4.) There was a dirty towel sitting in the same place on a ledge near us the whole time we were there. These are the reasons I have a 4 instead of a 5. I was actually pleasantly surprised with our experience and I will continue to go back, especially if we can keep.getting Michelle for our server, or ones.just like her. I also.have to mention the hostess(didn't catch her name). She was such a lovely girl. She greeted us and sat us promptly. She was such a sweet girl and had a genuine  kindness and beautiful smile. On the way out the door, she actually got to it and opened it up for us befire we got there. She set the tone for the experience, as she is the first and last one we see. This is the experience we and everyone else should get every single time. These girls have really raises the bar, hopefully we can expect consistency in our future visits.

I ordered the garlic herb fries and they looked nothing like the Happy Valley location...there was hardly any garlic and not one herb. We had two small  combined tables (for 3 people) and my side of the table was so wobbly that it made it very uncomfortable. Oh yes, my mothers salad came with garlic toast, but it was so burned it did not taste normal. I'll be going to the Happy Valley location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20,2.96,3.22,3.22,2.8880000000000003,3.1160000000000005

The service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and modern. We have been coming to Red Robin for years and I will say I miss their old decor of old movie posters and random nostalgic trinkets from years past.  The seats are comfy and the booths are roomy (fluffy friendly). And each table is equipped with a tablet that lets you order drinks, appetizers, desserts, and your meal (or you could just wait for your server but it is a time saving tool for sure)- and pay.  The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli. Kinda nice that they offer healthier options but I'll stick with the steak fries. Be sure to sprinkle the table-side seasoning on your fries too for the extra kick in flavor.  And did I mention there is a full bar here too? Let's also not forget about bottomless root beer floats! Yes, you read that right - bottomless. Root. Beer.

Seems everyone is advertising a gourmet burger. If it is a gourmet burger you can charge 3 to 4 dollars more. I looked up gourmet burger and read what three different people said. The one that made the most since was any burger that is more than hamburger, lettuce, tomato, cheese (American cheese which to me is plastic cheese), can be called a gourmet burger. Which does not mean it is any better tasting than a regular hamburger done right. I don't remember the exact burger I ordered but I asked for it without a bun and no fries. They did what I thought was the right thing and said I could have a salad instead of the fries. Nice!! Most places will do this but want an extra dollar or more. Hats off to Red Robin. They sandwiched the burger between two pieces of lettuce that consisted of about three leafs each side. Again hats off to Red Robin I was impressed with the presentation.  As they say two out of three aint bad.

I visited this Red Robin and had a crappy experience.. so I give up! My husband and I ordered two appetizers and one dessert to spend our gift card. We got our 'double berry cheesecake' with no actual berries (it was supposed to come with strawberries and a berry sauce). It came with the berry sauce, which was like a watered down strawberry jam, but no strawberries. Then we also ordered these chips covered in pulled pork and cheese and red onions... and it came straight from the microwave. It had been microwaved so long that it was impossible to pull the chips apart and the cheese was not melty anymore. It was more like a rock. Not to mention, it didn't even come with the onions it mentions in the description and shows in the photo. When I asked the very busy bartender if she could send it back and request that it not be microwaved, she said that they microwave it to get the cheese to melt, instead of obliging and apologizing. When I told her that the description did not say that it was microwaved and that I would like it to not be microwaved, she again did not apologize but instead gave me an attitude and wandered off with the returned food.

They even have those computers on the tables for apps and desserts and you can pay there too. So you would think the server would get to together. Nope. Specifically said we wanted apps first and to wait for our order to be in. Still 3 minutes after apps, plates come out. Then he offers to put them under the warmer. No! Gross!  The food is good here but I expect better service for what I pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3,3.12,3.13,3.13,,3.126
56,Scott R.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,2017-11-22,Poor service - had to ask for host to send someone over for drink order after 7-10 mins. Food not hot. Worst experience I've had at a Red Robin. Avoid this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3,3.04,3.1,3.1,,3.0760000000000005
41,Tammy M.,"Glendale, AZ",46,101,26.0,2.0,2017-12-30,Ugh. I was looking forward to a good burger but unfortunately it didn't happen. I ordered the BBQ boss hog (or something to that name). It was ok but pretty skimpy on the burger patty and the pulled pork. I guess at least the BBQ sauce was good. Hubby ordered a pig out burger and was told it was the larger of two similar burgers. The burger was smaller than a Wendy's double and he ordered it well done and it came closer to rare. It also came with some veggies which he requested not be on the burger (same as another person in our party). We told the waitress but since we all had our food already we didn't want to have to wait.  She said she'd mention it to the manager and we expected something to be discounted on the bill but there was nothing mentioned or taken off the bill. The fries were mushy but one basket actually came out hot so those were good. Our server was very good but the food is overpriced and not that great. We could have gotten tastier food elsewhere at a far better price. Most likely won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3,2.92,3.11,3.11,,3.034
