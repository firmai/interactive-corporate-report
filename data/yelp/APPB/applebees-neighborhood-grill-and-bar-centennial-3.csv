Michael W M.,"Crestone, CO",1,29,18,1.0,7/5/2015,"Service was terrible. Waitress forgot our waters. Then forgot our libations. I spoke to the manager. He apologized but then my salad never materialized, then missing breadsticks. Our wait staff call button blinked the entire meal on that electronic gizmo that is supposed to let you call your staff. The best the manager could do for us was take $9 off. Pretty bad experience. This Taco is NOT for you... !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3?start=20
Steven M.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,39,17,1.0,12/13/2015,"I received a gift card from a friend so I decided to go here tonight with my wife. We walked in and were greeted quickly. The greeter asked how many in our party and I replied 2. He began walking us toward a table and I started hearing the sound of a screaming baby from the other side of the restaurant. He kept walking towards the sound and eventually tried to sit us as close as possible to this screaming baby. I looked at him and said, ""Nope"". He didn't seem to understand why but I requested a table on the other side of the restaurant and he said, ""no problem"". I realize it wasn't his fault that parents take their annoying babies to restaurants and then ignore them when they start screaming but he should have had the sense to not sit me next to it while it was in the middle of a fit. We eventually wound up at a table on the other side of the restaurant. We sat there for about 5 minutes looking at the menu and hadn't had anyone acknowledge us. I decided that we would leave in 2 more minutes if no one came to the table. We had 3 waitstaff casually walk past our table in that time and none of them even looked at us. Not sure who dropped the ball, greeter or waitstaff, but I didn't feel like dealing with it. So my wife and I left and went to the grocery store down the road.  Normally with this type of service I'd just ignore the establishment for the next year or so but because we had a gift card we needed to use, we decided to call in a ""Carside To Go"" order. My wife called as soon as we got to the grocery store. They asked her the standard questions and then asked what kind of car we would be driving so they could bring us our order when we pulled into the ""Carside To Go"" parking section. We did our shopping and went straight back to Applebee's. That took about 15 minutes which was exactly the time they said it would take to have our order ready. I pulled into the parking lot which I wouldn't call empty or packed. There was only one ""Carside To Go"" parking spot left. On the left of it was a handicapped spot and on the right was a person who is bad at parking their Ford F250. The spot they chose was also a ""Carside To Go"" parking spot but they weren't in the truck. Why don't they stop people from parking in those spots if they aren't getting a ""Carside To Go"" order? I don't think it would be difficult since they are supposed to come outside when someone pulls into one of these parking spaces. It turns out that they don't watch the spaces at all. We sat there for quite a while and nothing happened. We had never used this service before so I asked my wife if we were supposed to call or go in when we arrived but she didn't know. Wouldn't really make sense since they ask you about the car you are driving to pick up your order. After about 2-3 more minutes my wife said she would just go in and get the order. She walked in and came out 2 minutes later. The order was ready and waiting when she arrived.  We got home and ate our wings. 1 order of boneless and 1 order of classic bone-in. After eating we both acknowledged that Applebee's isn't really worth eating at anymore. The sub-mediocre food is very overpriced which goes well with the service they provide. If you are in this area and looking for a decent ""chain restaurant"" to eat at, I would suggest the Chili's that is kitty corner to this Applebee's. I've found that they are far more consistent with service and food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3?start=20

After that was corrected I sat with an empty beer for 5 mins thirsty while my bartender sat across the restaurant chilling with the other servers.  When the bartender came back to finally refill my drink she got me another beer in the same glass.  Applebee's is known for its neighborhood feel.

Ashley H.,"Denver, CO",26,265,8,2.0,6/29/2011,"My food was alright but my waitress wasn't.  We were sat quickly but the waitress took a few mins to take our order, was slow, and every time she checked on us it was whenever the conversation she was having with the table next to us got boring. That and when she did decide to come check on us she talked to us like we were inconveniencing her. [I hate to break it to her but it's your job to check on us from time to time and be somewhat nice] The food was slow to come to us which I'm not going to blame on the kitchen staff. Our drinks took a little while to get to us and the shake we ordered took almost 10 mins to get to my friend after I was served my drink. Our food was good. My steak was perfectly cooked and nothing was missed or messed up. My friend shrimp were cooked right too and everything seemed alright aside from some ranch missing. By the time we finished I was a little hesitant to pay cash because I had a feeling the waitress would pocket the extra $10 as a tip and not bring me change. It took her awhile to get back with the change but I was happy she did. Over all The food here is alright but I wouldn't want to sit down in this place.

Anita Y.,"Berthoud, CO",57,311,13,2.0,4/21/2011,"I always wonder if a restaurant can ever recover from a bad review by me.   Is the bad taste (I made a funny!) left in my mouth is just too much? Here we were, back again and on a tight schedule. Sat in the bar, 6:10 pm, we got our food in time, got the drinks (waters all around, it's on us!) got out on schedule, but this place still gets only 2 stars from me. Wonton tacos? topped in coleslaw? No balance of flavor, and I couldn't tell the chicken from the pig. Spinach Artichoke Dip was basically flavorless, and the warmed corn chips had lost their crunch.  My personal taste calls for toasted bread with artichoke dip. Nothing wrong with our server.  She got it all on the table in time for us to wolf it down and run. And she even got my annoying request of ""no ice"" in my drink, it's surprising how many people forget that one short order.... And even though I didn't need or use the knife, I'm going to complain that it was dirty. Applebee's, I don't think you'll ever come out on top with me.

Mike M.,"Littleton, CO",8,21,,1.0,4/11/2011,"Typical Applebees food. What's not so typical is the bad service. The waitstaff has been pretty bad here every time we go there. If you want mediocre food and bad service this is the place to go.  Our last and I actually me last trip here, the waitress was training a new hire. This was actually the worst service to date. Our waitress passed our table by many time to talk to the sloshed older ladies behind us. I'm guessing she was chasing what she thought was gonna be a better tip. The girl she was training didn't come to the table not once. The kitchen staff brought out our food and got us more drinks. This is not the first time we have gotten bad service here. to be honest its pretty much the typical attitude there.  We have sworn off this Applebees. We now go across the street to chili's.

S. J. C.,"Littleton, CO",0,60,,1.0,6/27/2012,"We had dinner at this Applebee's a couple of weeks ago after not having been there in several years. The waitress specifically asked if I wanted my burger cooked through or with a little pink, the inference being that it would be cooked to order. I requested my burger pink. It arrived overcooked, dried out, and had clearly been cooked several hours earlier. I mentioned thiis to the manager. He looked me right in the eye and said, ""Oh, no. We don't ever cook our hamburgers in advance.""  Yeah, right. We stupidly gave the place another chance this evening. Same song and dance from the waitress; same request for medium-rare; same dried out, overdone burger that was probably left over from lunch. I guess they think you're going to load it up with mustard and mayo and won't even notice, but I don't put any of that stuff on my burger so it's pretty easy to tell when it's cooked to order and when it's been cooked hours in advance. It was also about 80 degrees in there. Maybe they hadn't paid the electric bill.  There won't be a third time at this place. Bottom line: If the food at this Applebee's is any indicator, it's pretty easy to see why a number of them have gone out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3?start=20

It didn't even have bluecheese like it said it has. My husband took it up to the manager on duty and she looked through it like we were lying. The best part of our dinner was my husband ordered the chicken wings bone in and every drumette had the missing leg.

It's just not really worth the money or the calories.  It's a typical American restaurant where most of the meals come with potato and onion as the veg, there's no other side with veg to choose and all the side salads are covered with bacon and cheese.  The food we had was cooked well, for the most part, nothing was dry or overcooked.  My meal was meant to have mushrooms with the onions but I was lucky to see more than two. But the whole experience just wasn't enjoyable.  There's no drink prices on the menu, we just ordered water till we had time to look at the drinks menu and after bringing out water our waitress (names was something like Casey or Carly) didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink. She was a bit rough round the edges too, not very professional or anything.  It felt like she didn't really want us there, we'd already explained that we'd never been there before and would need a minute with the menu, so she checked on us 4 times before we were ready to order. We hadn't finished our apps when the mains came out, and while I'm still eating my meal she is standing there asking if we want dessert! I just looked at her and said ""I'm not sure yet"" pointing at my half eaten plate. How rude!! I think she got the point after that because she didn't come back.

She picked Fiesta Lime chicken and I opted for a american burger. We got the chicken for appetizer.  Sauce on the side.  The burgers come in seared. That means you will not see neither onion or pickles on your burger. That was my experience. It was a medium sized bun with a burger and american cheese on top.  I ate whoppers and they taste a lot better with lettuce,onions and tomatoes. That was a serious fail. I do not think I want to eat a burger at Applebee's as long as they sear in my onion and pickle with the burger. Did I mention my burger was burnt? I guess I should not have said no pink. I think I saw a piece of pickle in my meat on my last bite.  My wife's chicken was good but there was too much rice compared to the Chicken.

Brocolli was fine, gave it all to my dog and she as usual loves it. Maple sweet potato mash is it's usuall yummy self. Parking lot pretty empty so I figure the restaurant inside was too. At the 9 minute mark after the promised Curb to Go delivery time, I actually had phone in hand and was dialing to ask where my order was when the kid ran out with it.

James H.,"Denver, CO",0,34,,3.0,5/18/2017,"Barring some peculiarity of location, I feel it can be almost a waste of time to review a place like Applebee's, a national chain, because, let's face it, you've made up your mind already. If you want to go there, reading this won't stop you, and if you don't, I doubt my powers of persuasion are sufficient to induce a volte-face. But! Since you're here, and since you asked, and since you're still reading this, here're my two cents... This Applebee's is fine. Went here with my wife a few days ago, a Monday night, for dinner, and we both got burgers, which is a good deal Monday night. Any burger for $6.99. And some of them get a little spendy, up to $11.99 or $12.99 normally. So not bad. We both got the classic burger. I thought it was pretty good. Prepared as requested. My wife thought hers was too ""burgery"". She said the meat really could have used some seasoning or something - it just tasted like ground beef smells when it's cooking. No real problem, just personal preference. The only issue was it took a tad too long to get our food. Also, service was fair. I like a quality check partway through the meal (e.g., ""Everything taste okay, folks?""). Call me old-fashioned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
William H.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,2,1.0,4/12/2017,"I have been going to Applebee's for several years and this was the worst experience I've ever had. I sat at the bar waiting for my order. The bartender only had two customers, he only wanted to watch TV all the time I was there and the bar was filthy.     Food and used silverware was sitting on the bar in front of me, not on a plate just on the bar. probably won't be back. We had a carry out order, chicken strips. The chicken was Ok however there was no dipping sauce in the bag. It easy for them to o I'm sorry about the issues.  Maybe they need a health inspector to give them a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,398,,2.0,12/17/2016,"We were one of 2 parties there for most of our lunch which is fine with us for a nice quick lunch, but it didn't translate to quick service.  Our server was fine (she didn't seem to be a fan of us just doing the buy one get one free with waters because I hate Pepsi) but she didn't do anything wrong, but for some reason it took a half hour for us to get our two basic meals.  The food was okay (not great like Applebees was 10 years ago) but not worth the wait.  It will be a couple years before we try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
Ash E.,"Sarasota, FL",36,4,,1.0,2/1/2017,"There is no excuse for how bad this Apple Bees service was. There was nobody in the restaurant and yet, our food came so slow, the order was incorrect, and the server forgot our to go order and then lied about it. Do not go to this restaurant it's awful. We ended up having to wait an extra 25 to 30 minutes for our to go order because of his incompetence. And there was no one in the restaurant. Absolutely no excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
Richard S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",10,11,1,1.0,8/17/2016,Very very slow... I waited for 45 minutes for my food and it was sub par at best. The server maybe said 10 words to me.  Just not the best experience.  I wish I would have gone to another place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
P S.,"Littleton, CO",0,7,,4.0,8/20/2016,Generally good service host staff is very kind. Bar tenders have consistently produced very strong drinks that were lacking some in the taste department. New food selections are great the steak grill smells up the whole university intersection it is there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
Randy J.,"Littleton, CO",20,294,45,3.0,8/6/2015,"The service is good at this location and the food is your typical corporate menu.  It is also prepared in a typical corporate store manner, but they will customize it if you ask them to do it.  The prices are pretty decent and its a good place to take the family as the menu is dynamic for all.  If you are looking for a decent spot and want to save money then I would go to this spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-centennial-3
