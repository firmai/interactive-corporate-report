Daniel C.,"Saint James, NY",83,107,538,4.0,7/16/2017,"Came for dinner at around six o'clock and the place was relatively empty. When we sat down our waiter came straight over and took our drink order, when he came back with the drinks we were ready to order. I ordered the Santa Fe Bowl (summer menu) and my wife ordered the wild mushrooms pasta (new menu item). I really enjoyed the Santa Fe bowl it was really fresh and light. Every ingredient put together blended well together from the toasted pepitas to the ranch poblano sauce. My wife loved her pasta dish it was just the right amount and was perfectly cooked!! The service was excellent, every time our drinks were low the waiter would have a new one ready! My only negative about the place is when you have carpet in a restaurant the amount of foot traffic it takes leaves a weird carpet smell in the restaurant.  Other then that everything was excellent. Definitely will be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove
Amanda F.,"Patchogue, NY",57,137,850,2.0,6/24/2017,"CPK ..... mediocre food and pizza it's good if your at the mall and there's no where else to eat when you just want a quick bite and drink.  Apps are okay... i make better spinach and artichoke dip.  Our margherita pizza wasn't that great, not enough seasoning and the bottom was soggy.  The salad had like fake ingredients .. fake hard boiled egg and weird looking bacon and chicken.  I don't think i'll be back ....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove

S Blair R.,"Port Chester, NY",159,7,2,3.0,12/26/2017,I love the food at CPK. The service at this one isn't the best though. No one greeted my party at the door. They're slow and not very accommodating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove
Sara E.,"Patchogue, NY",44,3,1,1.0,11/11/2017,"I really enjoyed their Thai chicken pizza before and came here after awhile of not eating here. The pizza didn't taste that bad but it was super skimpy on all the toppings and very dry. It was all dough.

I got the popular Avocado club egg rolls which were pretty good. I liked of the avocado and cheese and chicken but the crust of the egg roll was oily and too crunchy.

I ordered the Chicken Milanese.  It is the worst piece of chicken I've had in my life.  Over cooked, over seasoned hockey puck.

Maggie C.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",114,5,2,2.0,7/23/2017,"As high school students living in a college environment for a prolonged period of time, we were expecting a food delivery similar to that of the west coast. I supposed we were incorrect in assuming that, as the delivery did not know location, and the pizza for my vegan friend (margharita, no cheese) ended up simply being a piece of dough with sauce on the top. A waste of money, but as we are desperate for west coast best coast food, we will potentially order here again.

Kelli S.,"West Babylon, NY",173,43,4,4.0,4/3/2017,They had a lot of interesting choices for meal options and appetizer choices. My boyfriend and I tried the spicy buffalo cauliflower for the first time yesterday and omg was it delicious. I've been hearing about it from different sources and was dying to try it. The rest of the appetizer choices were also types that you won't find at most other places which can be a good thing or bad thing depending what you're in the mood for. My boyfriend typically tries their pasta dishes each time we go and never fails to be disappointed. I prefer trying out their diff flavors of pizza since they are called California Pizza Kitchen for a reason. I tried the Original BBQ Chicken pizza last time and was not a huge fan. It had good flavor and i love pineapples on my pizza but the BBQ sauce made the dough super mushy. Yesterday I tried the spinach and artichoke thin crust pizza and was much more satisfied. Amazing flavor and the thin crust is crispier which prevented it from any mush. Definitely recommend trying this place out!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove

Marisa D.,"Long Island, NY",165,278,662,2.0,1/31/2016,"I hate writing reviews for lousy meals but boy was this just so underwhelming that I feel that I need to do my due diligence as a Yelper & give an honest review. Came for lunch today since the Cheesecake Factory had a 45 minute wait and we weren't in the mood for Bobby's Burger Palace. Now I realize we should've had BBP instead of CPK. First of all we must've stood waiting for a table for an empty restaurant for at least 3-5 minutes. I mean plenty of employees around just it seemed like no one wanted to seat us. We finally got seated and it took a few more minutes to get greeted by our waiter. We decided we'd get the following: - Avocado Egg Rolls: which we used to love and they were just OK. - Tostada Pizza: which states that it's a crispy thin crust. This was more like a limp thin crust. Sorry this was just blah. It seemed like maybe one of the managers or cooks came around and asked us how our meal was. When we mentioned how the pizza was rather flimsy she asked if we wanted another one and we opted not to. Only to reply back to us with to order it more well done next time. How about no? It states it's a crispy thin crust and therefore it should be crispy without me having to specify that it should be more well done. Our server was nice but didn't bother to ask us how everything was. Maybe he could tell we were aggravated and just didn't add gas to the fire. Sorry CPK... but I don't think we'll ever be back after this. You used to be awesome with the potato salad, the egg rolls, and the spinach dip. Even the key lime pie used to be amazing!!! But now not so much. If I want chain pizza I rather hit up Blaze Fast Fire'd or Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. Skip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove

Anthony G.,"Islip Terrace, NY",54,19,13,3.0,10/3/2015,"Came here for dinner the other night not knowing what to expect . You don't necessarily think of pizza when you think of California but it wasn't too bad. My girlfriend loves this place and suggested it . The ambience is quite nice. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer which had tomatoes and chicken in it. It was a little too greasy but the flavor was good. I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza which was pretty good. It had caramelized onions, mozzarella, grilled chicken and of course garlic. I was pleased with my meal . In my opinion, the menu was a little overpriced for the pizza. The personal pies which are equivalent to around 2 slices are between 12-16 dollars. They have a variety of slices though.

Scott E.,"Bayport, NY",122,239,120,4.0,4/10/2014,"This California Pizza Kitchen is like a random black sheep of the chain...and I have no idea why. This place is literally never ever ever ever full. You can go in on a Friday night at 6, or Saturday at lunch, it doesn't matter. My mom loves CPK, so we find ourselves frequenting this one often mainly because....well there's a wait in other places. Anytime we know we can't wait, and just want some good food, we come here. Their food is always consistently good, and I have actually never really had a bad CPK experience here. Seating is fast (lol), food comes out quick, good servers, etc. What I got a few weeks ago and really really enjoyed: -the dumpling appetizer -the thai crunch salad - if you like salads, this one is one of the best I've had -the salted caramel pudding dessert - OMG. serious. for serious. I literally said OMG when tasting it.  So, if you're in the area, want good CPK food at a good price, and need to get in and get out, come here! It's a staple for me, and I'm personally extremely glad it's never that busy. Just hope it doesn't shut down anytime soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=40

When we got there we quickly seated and had our drink orders taken, which then came out fast. After deciding on what we were ordering we received our appetizer in a very timely fashion (we ordered the ginger chicken dumplings, which were fantastic), and the thin crust pizza we ordered came out relatively fast as well (Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza). The pizza was very well done, not undercooked, good seasonings. We then split a chocolate souffle which came out faster than the pizza and dumplings. All in all the dinner was great and the prices were very fair for their portions. I highly recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=40
Jill F.,"Manorville, NY",190,232,165,3.0,12/21/2011,"Went here for the first time tonight. Not a bad place to eat if you're looking for some tasty pizza. LOCATION: Nice location, next to the mall so you can do some shopping after you eat. DECOR: Cute decor, very casual but at the same time neat and clean. Soft lighting. FOOD/DRINK: I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza which was pretty tasty. It was around $13, kind of pricey considering the pizza was very small. It definitely was filling though if your eating just 1 pizza to yourself and not sharing. It's definitely not really ""authentic"" NY, italian pizza but its still pretty good./ I ordered a mango mojito which was $7. It was kinda pricey for that too considering the glas was very small, but it was a delicious drink.

Elizabeth H.,"Coram, NY",0,14,1,5.0,6/21/2014,"We downloaded the app and got a free appetizer the last time we were here, which brought us right back.  There seems to never be a wait, compared to the other restaurants around it.  For appetizers we will ALWAYS order the avocado egg rolls, they are delicious and come out quickly. They serve them with what i believe is a ranch dipping sauce and another sauce that has a little spice to it.  Have tried multiple pizzas and all were great. If you're not in a pizza mood, the four cheese raviloi is amazing and is perfectly portioned. At the end of your meal they also give you a coupon you can't open until the next time you are there to find out how much it is for, which pretty much insures we will be eating here again in the near future.

Andrea C.,"Huntington Station, NY",72,45,82,3.0,9/24/2013,"The last time I ate at a CPK was back in May 2013 and at the Huntington location. That was not the best experience and things seemed to have gone South as far as food quality and service. Tonight was a much better experience and CPK earned back some brownie points. It was late, past the normal dinner time rush, the place was pretty empty and we were pressed for time so it was nice to have the food come out rather quickly.  Due to the hour we ate on the light side splitting the classic BBQ chicken chopped salad, Bianco flatbread and Belgian chocolate suffle cake. Everything was really good and wouldn't hesitate to recommend ordering any of the dishes. I've had the BBQ chicken chopped salad many times before but not in a lng time and was reminded of why it's a classic at CPK. First time, but not the last, for both the Bianco flatbread and Belgian chcocolate suffle cake.

Anyway we ended up having a seat right near the kitchen doors that weren't closed. It was like 2 in the afternoon and there wasn't a soul in there besides the wait staff. We ordered our food got out appetizer right away and than after we were finished I watched my pizza get set down ready to be taken out and my boyfriends as well, so I got excited and was like oh our food is coming.. Well it didn't, it got so ridiculous to the point where my boyfriend had timed it.. He said our food sat there for over 20 minutes. Even in between that time frame  our waiter came over and asked do you want refills we said yes, and that's when he disappeared. I had gotten the barbecue chicken pizza, which after sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes means the red onions are all wilted the pizza was hard to break apart. The waiter could tell I was disappointed and got the manager, so I waited another 20 minutes for them to make me another pizza which I ended up eating one slice due from picking on my boyfriends food who luckily for a cold sandwich....

Christina P.,"Wading River, NY",76,54,112,2.0,5/8/2015,"Haven't had a bad dining experience like this in a while. I used to come here about a year ago and the place would be packed out and there was always a wait on weekends. To my surprise on a Friday evening at dinner time there was no wait. Sat with a couple other people. The waitress didn't understand any general questions we had about the food. I asked about how a certain dish was served and she was wrong about it. Okay now about what we ordered- the Cobb salad had burnt bacon in it that was so black it looked like a thin piece of charcoal. The lettuce wrap appetizer is one of those ""make your own"" things. Doesn't say that on the menu. Now I might not mind if I was at some random pub-- but to be at a nice restaurant I don't like having to make my own anything using my hands. The app comes with huge pieces from a head of lettuce that are way too big to fill, impossible to wrap and roll them and messy to eat, the mixture and sauce to fill them with tasted good at first but after eating it for a little was nauseating. The whole thing was very messy and hard to eat. It came with shrimp that were undercooked tiny pieces of garbage shrimp. The waitress asked if we were still working on our plates as we had our forks in hand, chewing a mouthful of food and stood there waiting for a response. Lol just kind of comical. Bad experience altogether and not going back any time soon.

I'll save it for when I go into the city. Anyway, I order a $14 salad and my wife orders a Basil pizza so we can split both the salad and pizza. The $14 salad was ok but the pizza? For pizza made in a brick oven it was horrible. It was really doughy and undercooked. I'd rather eat pizza at Cosmos Pizza in Stony Brook and I hate that place.

Ash F.,"Brockport, NY",246,113,122,4.0,6/30/2015,"I have always loved CPK. Their walt whitman mall location is much better than their smithhaven mall location, in my opinion. Their appetizers are amazing, ALWAYS get the avacado egg rolls and the sesame dumplings! They are delicious. I used to get the roasted garlic chicken, but they took it off the menu and I stopped going as often. I do love their pies though, they are very delicious and flavorful. Their thai lettuce wraps are delicious too - I prefer them here over the cheesecake factory. The atmosphere is very nice and the staff is professional.

Mitchell R.,"Mount Sinai, NY",2,15,19,2.0,3/1/2015,This place has gotten so dirty. It really needs a cleaning and some upholstery work. The tables are sticky. Salt shakers dirty and booths have tape over the torn seats. This is why there is always a table here. Server was nice and attentive but we won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20
Drew B.,"New York, NY",20,66,12,4.0,3/30/2015,So we really like CPK but this locale is getting long in the  tooth.  It needs a redo. Tables are scratched and carved with folks initials.  Several booths have tears in seats.  Last visit two of three pizzas came out a bit scorched.  A couple behind us returned a burned pie.  We will continue or love for CPK. But attention is needed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20
Walter C.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",29,7,,3.0,6/5/2016,"Had the dumpling appetizer good start small but 3 of us shared . I was able to sample a beer I was interested in ordering good thing since I wasn't crazy for it good suggestion by our waitress to sample it . Stephanie was a very good waitress she was engaging and making suggestions like she was eating with us . She did a really good job . She brought me a beer I knew I would like our pizzas were good and hot and we traded of course Jamaican jerk,California club, bbq chicken with bacon added . All were good we all enjoyed each other's pizzas no room for dessert . Only complaints my wife's sangria she said was watered down and one of our appetizer plates on the table was dirty with food crust on it yuck . But overall good food and great service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20
Jim B.,"Stony Brook, NY",90,14,1,1.0,10/24/2015,"Kids salad is actually not a asalad at all. It's lettuce with gold fish. Does CPK have any other vegetables? You would expect to have tomatoes at the least.  We usually have decent service but tonight we were seated for 20 minute before we saw a waiter or waitress. And, in that time I went to the hostess station and asked a different waitress for help. If you're in the Smithhaven Mall there are plenty of better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20
Karen S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",2,15,15,1.0,8/16/2015,"So we walk in at 415pm on a Sunday. Most of the staff is sitting by the bar tables eating. No hostess. After a minute one employee gets up and seats us. Drink order took forever even though the restaurant is empty. They never brought bread to us and I asked the waitress for some bread cause my daughter was starving. She brings three pieces of bread with a giant blubber of butter in the middle. It was butter with bread. We are waiting for our food when I hear Ken behind the bar talking to a tall waitress about smoking marijuana and blunts.. Like REALLY!!! I mean I'm liberal but these are not conversations for working hours. We've waited now 30 minutes and out pizzas are still not here although line I said.. PLACE IS EMPTY!!

Melissa I.,"Columbia, MD",8,13,1,2.0,8/3/2015,"CPK used to be one of my favorite restaurants to come to, however it has slowly declined. We were here on a relatively slow day and our service reflected that. It was painfully slow, took a very long time to get our food, have a server come to our table, etc. The food was mediocre, nothing special. I'm sad that it has gone downhill so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20
Anthony A.,"Merrick, NY",22,45,6,4.0,7/11/2015,"CPK in Smith Haven Mall is okay if you are looking for a chain restaurant where you can share some apps, small plates and all types of funky pizzas at a very reasonable price. We shared a chicken tinga quesadilla which is an item we used to love but has really gone down hill. We've noticed its decline over he last few visits but this time it was particularly disappointing since there was almost no chicken or beans in it at all. The dumplings were very good as was the jerk chicken pizza. What gets this review to a 4th star is our excellent server Kenny. He was so attentive and even reminded us how we didn't want bacon on our to go food since he remembered us ordering no bacon on our original order.

Amber S.,"Huntington, NY",46,57,6,3.0,2/26/2014,"So I ended up coming back, as we were celebrating a friend'a birthday and this was her pick. I once again ordered a gluten free pie, and told the waitress I had some issues in the past.  When our food was delivered, the manager came over and told me she supervised the production of the pizza and to contact her if I had any issues.  The pizza this time was gluten free, but tasted MUCH different than the last time I was here, leading me to believe they gave me a regular pie last time.  In addition, we had a drink at the bar before our group arrived and their credit card machine went down, so the bartender added it to our food bill. Imagine my surprised when the charge showed up anyway on my bill. I called the store to have it resolved and it eventually was, but still annoying.  Overall I think their customer service seems to be improving but they have some ways to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=20

Augie P.,"Northport, NY",42,133,1,3.0,3/28/2012,"Pizza. Was never a fan of chain pizza joints, except pizzeria UNO. I loved them. I figured I'd try CPK and it was decent. I went back again a few times and again, it was OK. Service was ok and nothing great. The wife had a macaroni dish and I had the pizza that's full of meat. It def was better than the first pizza I had (name slips my mind at the moment).

Suzanne S.,"Charlotte, NC",84,168,3,4.0,5/9/2011,"I really like their pizzas.  The taste is just sensational and there are so many fun pizzas to choose from.  Their side salads also just fix my salad craving before I dig into the actual pizza.  We've experienced solid service, albeit our visit was not during peak hours.  My glass was consistently full and that's hard since most of my friends think I need a diet coke IV. The ambiance is nothing special but there are plenty of comfy booths and ample tables.  Some of their drink specials looked yummy but I haven't tried any yet.  My only complaint is that I find the pizzas can be pretty pricey.  So don't go in with the typical ""pizza bill"" in mind, it will likely be more.  That being said, they do use more gourmet type ingredients on some of their pizzas.  In total, I'm a fan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lake-grove?start=60
Bo W.,"Commack, NY",0,10,3,4.0,10/26/2013,"We stopped by this place for lunch while doing some Halloween shopping at the mall. We started with the white corn guacamole. The guac was good but the chips were a little stale. I'd def order it again. For the entree we had the Sicilian thin crust, the poblano pepper, and the Hawaiian. The portion sizes were perfect and each platter tasted good. The service was prompt and friendly. Sure, it's a chain restaurant and us New Yorkers are a pretentious lot when it comes to pizza so most of the negative reviews here have no gravitas.

I expected a little more flavour and pizazz from my Hawaiian pizza, but got neither except for one awkward bite where it tasted like some hot sauce had been accidentally spilled. Fiancée's pear salad pizza seemed to be better, but the caramelized onions put her off a bit. But the service. This guy seemed to be in some kind of rush the whole time. There were plenty of empty tables, and none of the rest of the wait staff seemed to be in a rush. Our empty dishes weren't bussed right away, sometimes not at all. I had to remind the guy about my drink order. And as we are still eating he brings us over the check and says ""Not to rush you guys...."" I quickly asked for a dessert menu to stall for more time, and he brought it over and had to explain what his favourite dessert items were. And which ones he didn't like. Thanks, buddy.

I crave it!! This is not chain pizza, it is not New York pizza, but it is not chain pizza.  It doesn't taste like a cardboard box, it tastes like heaven! HA!  I have tried a few other pizzas, but will not stray from my favorite.  The wait staff is friendly, and their drinks are VERY good - try the appleberry sangria mmm!!

Michael P.,"Manhattan, NY",3,20,,1.0,4/15/2011,"This place completely sucks! One of the worst dining experiences. Our first time there and the food was mediocre, nothing special at all. The portion size was also ridiculously small and way over priced!  I can order ""one"" slice of REAL pizza elsewhere that is larger then their whole pie! And for only $1.75!!!  The pizzas here average $12-$15 each. Absolutely ridiculous!! The service was even more horrid!  Please don't waste your money like we did. Went there with my wife and we thought ""let's try it"". It was so not a good idea. They over charged us for a combo pizza. We told the waitress it was our first time, and she told us we could mix two half pizzas to make one pie if we wanted. No mention of an extra charge for that, so we ordered thinking it was a good way to try out what they have. The service was slow, and when the bill came out it was insane! They charged us almost double the price of one pizza for two half pizzas! The pizzas are already very pricey. After asking why it was so high, they said they charge extra for mixing two half pies to make one. Being that the waitress never told us that little tidbit of info, and knowing it was our first time, we thought they would just correct the mistake. Nope! she apologized and said she would talk to the manager. No manager in sight, she just comes back with another bill for the most expensive pizza we ordered! It wouldn't have been a problem except the other half pizza we ordered was the cheapest on the menu! How is that fair? The manager never made an appearance, the food was average, and the large bill for lame tasting pizza with shotty service left us completely disgusted. You have to understand that this place sells designer pizza, and they are charging for a special experience. I could make a lot better designer pizza at home, I'm completely serious.
