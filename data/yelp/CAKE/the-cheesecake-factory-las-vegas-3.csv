Darryl G.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,,5.0,1/5/2018,Never can go wrong with cheesecake factory. The service is always outstanding and the meals are always so big you can take half home and be full.

Daniel P.,"Secaucus, NJ",58,71,129,4.0,2/2/2017,"First time ever dining at a Cheese Cake Factory! It's funny because there are two close to my residence but I go to Las Vegas to try it. It's in the the Cesar Forum shops right next to the Zeus Atlantis show. It's not a bad location and the surrounding is nice to look at! Okay the food...wow. Their huge menu was off putting but the food I ordered silenced my apprehension.  I ordered the portabella, avocado and zucchini appetizer. I never eat fried food but I'm happy I ordered it. Enjoy the finer, fattening things in life sometimes.  My main dish was the fish tacos! Hell yes! I loved it! Fish was cooked perfectly and it came with black beans and rice. I was full by the end of the meal. Please try this place out and enjoy your time in a great city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Charlie B.,"El Paso, TX",17,77,156,1.0,7/19/2017,"We went last Friday the 14th of July,  another Cheesecake Factory,  another bad experience.  To start off with the Hostess was rude, and instead of waiting an hour,  we waited 1 hour 45 minutes to be seated. So we get upstairs, we have to wait another 5 min to be seated. We sit down and it takes the unhappy, uncaring, feminine waiter, about 10 minutes to acknowledge us, and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks, no alcohol, just water and soda. I was looking at the other waiter and he was fast with his customers.  We order our food... 45 minutes later they bring everyone their food,  15 minutes later they bring my chicken wings and cold fries.  During the long wait,  I filled up on delicious bread, that was the only good thing.   My aunt and uncle had cold, hard, white rice with their meal. The manager said he would give us all free cheesecake for our bad experience, wrong! Only 2 of us got it,  and my cheesecake tasted dry, and the whip cream on top was hard!  Never again, Austin and Las Vegas Cheesecake Factory just isn't good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Grace L.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,59,164,4.0,1/4/2017,"Being a chain restaurant I would say this place is definitely consistent with other locations I've been to.  Large menu with tons of variety you are sure to find something that will suit your fancy. Some would say a bit overpriced, but portions are sized to match in my opinion.  My family loves the ""brown bread"" and we have found that the servers will gladly bring you a basket with just the bread of your liking. What I liked about this location was the waiting process. When you approach the host stand if there is going to be a wait they hand you a card and tell you to come back after X minutes from the time written on the card (which is the time you first check in). This gives you time to wander and shop.  In my experience, upon your return they are able to seat you pretty much immediately. If a table comes up before the noted wait time then they will call out your name, but if you happen to not hear or you are in another shop no worry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Charlotte C.,"Burbank, CA",2,5,,1.0,11/4/2017,"My friends and I are locals and we came to celebrate a birthday, it was 10 of us and they told us that the wait will be for 30-45 minutes, we ended up waiting 1 hour and a half. Once we got seated we waited another hour to get the food. We weren't happy and called the manager and the manager clearly didn't give a s**t, didn't want to make a small gesture, or not even an apology! We all are very disappointed and on top of that he pretty much said that we were liars and that we only waited 5 minutes. Who waits 5 minutes at a restaurant on the strip? Haha.  We won't be coming back, neither should you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Vegas D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,11/4/2017,"First, the Service. Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion:  B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour.  It was more like 35 minutes.  Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle.  Our server - Sheena.  The epitome of exceptional customer service.  Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires.  An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back.  Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter.  She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed.  From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert.  Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service.  Sheena was always one step ahead.  Thinking of pepper?  Too late, Sheena is already asking.  Shredded cheese?  Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation.  Question about the food?  Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree.  I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead.  We were so lucky to have been served by this great person.  Such a delight to have as our server.   She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena's performance.  The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena's service.  The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule.  No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down.  For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke?  The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented.  Just the right amount of crisp.  The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads.  The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little.  My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate.  It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion.  The food was very good.  Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena.  For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn't have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl.  Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow!  Thank you so much!  Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service.  Truly a unique experience.  That 30% tip should have been at least 50%.  Well deserved. Thank you again.  The Arroyo family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Doron M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,30,4.0,10/25/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. Sure, the quality is not exactly sophisticated, each entree' is worth a daily calorie intake, and the drinks are way too sugary, but boy they taste so good. The place is famous for its never ending menu, and enormous portions. It's all true, choosing an entree is hard, but you can't really go wrong here. I got the Louisiana Pasta, and it was so good. I couldn't finish my plate and since then all I can think of going back to TCF to get it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Nick M.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",346,768,166,4.0,4/3/2017,"Located in the Caesar Forum, you have to walk through the whole thing to find this place -- tucked in on the side, and packed with people. The menu is HUGE. I had never been before at any other location, and i was mesmerized by the size of the menu and how many calories each dish contained. Eff it, I was on vacation. The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot. For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended. Service was good, Our waiter enjoyed talking to us about where we were from and what we had planned while in Vegas. If you're in the area or walking around Caesar's and want some grub or booze, this is a solid option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
LaWanda H.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,33,332,4.0,9/4/2017,"My hubby, daughter and I came here for lunch August 16, 2017. We were at Queens Center Mall doing a little shopping and decided to stop at this newly opened location for lunch. Well I must say this place is very good. We enjoyed everything we ordered. We had the loaded bake potato tots which was sooo yummy and cheesy. We also ordered the chicken pot sticker dumplings. My goodness so delicious . For our entree's my hubby had the chicken Parmesan pizza style which he loved, loved, loved. My daughter had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken. She loved it! I had my Shrimp scampi over linguini which was so amazing. Our server was very professional and attentive to our needs. We will definitely return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Kathryn Y.,"San Bruno, CA",19,228,1179,4.0,9/10/2017,"Like Cheesecake Factory's we have here in CA, delicious! Oddly, we didn't have to wait to get seated (3 of us), we were prepared since it's in a mall and it was during the HOT summer we were here.

Jojo C.,"Irvine, CA",100,26,10,1.0,9/3/2017,"This location in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace needs to get their act together. If you tell a party of 7 that it will take 1.5-1.75 hours you need to make sure to seat them at that time especially when you have sr. citizens in the party who need to eat.  It is understandable during a long holiday weekend that it will be long lines anywhere, but it shouldn't require manager intervention to make sure we get seated after waiting for 2 hours. I've been to Cheesecake Factory all over California as well as Summerlin ... I expected more from this location. Terribly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20
Douglas S.,"Toronto, Canada",50,133,42,3.0,2/25/2017,"Ridiculously long wait for service when the restaurant was otherwise slow, and the food was barely passable. Our waitress appeared disheveled, and she certainly wasn't very efficient. We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes. When the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don't worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass. Overall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn't all that exciting anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=20

Gina C.,"Stockton, CA",2,4,2,1.0,11/13/2017,Terrible service. Asked for bread that was never brought until the food despite reminders. Dinner orders were incorrect for 3 orders.

Also, request to sit inside and away from the show, the 2nd time around it started while we were dining and it was extremely loud and annoying! The food and service here was great.

Julianne T.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",31,42,106,4.0,1/6/2018,My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 7pm and the wait was only 10 minutes for two. AVOCADO EGG-ROLLS are a must have! Our waitress was very nice and the service was fast. I believe her name was Heidi.

Sushane P.,"Honolulu, HI",116,75,403,4.0,1/4/2018,"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory lover, I really wanted to eat here before we left Vegas. My husband and I along with our friends went for dinner.  It's super busy, so the wait was about an hour or more. But they have cool attractions and stores close by. The fish tanks out front is very appealing. My daughter enjoyed walking around looking at the fishes.Cheesecake Factory's location within Caesars Palace is a prime locations because there is just so much to see. Caesars Palace had a greek god show (not sure if they have it all the time) but the show was cool. We got to watch it as we ate.   The service wasn't that great because they were super busy. The food took awhile to come out. When it did come out, some of it was cold. I guess they wanted to wait for everything to be ready before they brought it out. But it was just too busy for us to ask them to heat up our food, considering we waited an hour to order and about 40 mins for our food to come out. Needless to say we still enjoyed our food. We are big Cheesecake Factory lovers. And the greek gods show definitely helped to keep us entertained.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory. Just remember if you choose to eat here, be prepared to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3
Sarah Princess E.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,3,7,5.0,1/2/2018,"Cheesecake Factory truly is one of my favourite restaurants -- Service is always tops and the portions are HUGE!  Dined in on the 21st of December for my baby sisters birthday outing and this location had the perfect vibe, music and staff. Our server Jeff was a delight so definitely ask for him when you're there! Their Avocado Egg Rolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce is to die for! If you haven't had it yet and want a savoury appetiser, it's the best choice. My Egg Rolls were fresh, crunchy and the sauce is delicious; If they bottled it and sell it, I'd definitely buy.  For my entrée, I had the yummy Evelyn's Favourite Pasta; rigatoni tossed with so many veggies and topped with a pesto.  I also got the Vegan Cobb Salad, which by the way is HUGE, so I definitely recommend sharing it!  Last but not least, my favourite part... the Cheesecake. You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake, that's just wrong.

Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",264,814,3204,4.0,12/26/2017,I have been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory since day one. This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  I got lucky enough to get a table as The Cheesecake Factory does get busy real fast.  As I already knew what I wanted to order. For the appetizer I had the Chicken Quesadilla that was excellent. For the main dish I had the BBQ Chicken Salad that was also excellent.  What I like about The Cheesecake Factory over the larger restaurant chains the food is always solid. The food portions are always large to share with others. Leave room for desserts. As the cheesecakes are a must. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the mango or raspberry cheesecake.  The customer service was excellent from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. This Cheesecake Factory location in the back of the forum shops. You have private lot parking and valet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4176,4.0,11/24/2017,"SWEET! With all the calories that could be potentially consumed at any TCF location, dining at TCF is a bonafide treat (for me, personally).  My mom and I both love cheesecake, and therefore we couldn't pass up the chance of dining at this location. LOCATION / SETTING: The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace near the aquarium.  Restaurant is 2 floors, with some seating on the first floor having views of the aquarium and Atlantis Show.   side NOTE:   We actually visited this location twice during our vacation last month.  The first time for take out cheesecake from their counter, and the 2nd for lunch on our last day. FOOD: The menu is enormous!  So much choices/selections....and that's just the dessert section.  The menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc.  Even for the most finicky of eaters, I'm sure there must be something on this menu that is appealing. After some time, we decided on the egg roll sampler, while my mom chose the Shepard's Pie, my brother selected the super oxidant salad, and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad (lunch portion).  For drinks, my mom and I ordered coffee, and my brother was all smiles when the server confirmed they could make him a Bloody Mary. The egg rolls were ok.  They were a bit more oily than I expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised since we ordered fried food for an appetizer.  Not sure if I would order this again.  Thereafter, our entrees were delivered to the table, and I am so happy there were lunch sizes available because my salad seemed (to me) as if it were a FULL SIZE order.  It was massive!  It was just enough for myself, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  If I were to order this again on a future visit, I would probably ask for no fried onions/onion rings (it just seemed a bit excessive to me).  My brother enjoyed his salad and finished the entire serving.  My mom, on the other hand, found her choice to just be mediocre.  In hindsight, she admitted she should have chosen something else such as a salad or sandwich.   Lastly, the cheesecake (like always) was very satisfying.  We ordered (at the take out counter) one slice each of the key lime and pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  I felt we needed to order the pumpkin since its a seasonal flavor, and we both concurred that both slices weren't overly sweet. SERVICE: Very exceptional.  The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately (we arrived at around 1045 am on a Saturday; the restaurant opened at 10am that day).  Our server was a friendly and knowledgeable woman, who answered all our menu questions, and periodically checked on us throughout our meal.   One last thing to mention:  the staff at the take out counter were polite and very efficient.   BOTTOM LINE: Convenient (take a break while shopping!) and spacious location.  Great service.  Delicious desserts!  Yay Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3
Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1004,3191,5.0,7/2/2017,"Hubby and I were enjoying a date night without the kiddo after a long crazy week and decided we needed to eat at the one and only chain restaurant we absolutely adore - The Cheesecake Factory. It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.  We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the ""spicy"" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).   There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine. I usually prefer a crazy Appetizer (any of the awesome egg rolls or fried Mac & cheese balls) or a salad if I want something light (Cobb or Greek).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3

The wait wasn't too long. Seating was intimate and I appreciate y server placing me at a table for two and not a table for four with two empty seats. That's a plus! Appetizers, entree, and desserts all came out with time to enjoy each course. The price isn't as expensive as my friends have been saying. It's decent and the refills keep coming for drinks. My server was really nice and speedy! I love the atmosphere in this restaurant!! Relaxing! Pros: Decent price, food chain, delicious food, great service, intimate setting, appealing decor Cons: A little crowded, dark lighting, no music, no wifi, no apple pay that I could see Overall: I'll be back very soon!

Judy C.,"Honolulu, HI",497,483,7846,5.0,4/5/2017,"Happy 400th Review and I am dedicating #400 to The Cheesecake Factory.  Why The Cheesecake Factory?  The Reason: This Cheesecake Factory location holds special memories I will never ever forget, I celebrated most of my anniversaries here at this Cheesecake Factory location, the very first celebration was our 7th, which I remember like it was yesterday. We have been back every year,since our 7th. That's many anniversaries here!!  This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going.  Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don't really visit this location back home often.  This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary.  I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall. This Cheesecake Factory is HUGE with 2 levels. During my recent visit, we got our table right away after checking in with the hostess, we went after the dinner rush, which was close to 8 pm.  We always end up ordering our usual, but I still like to glance thru the famous 10 page storybook menu with 200 menu items. I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual.  Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition.  Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp.  Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon?  Our entrée are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, & snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entrée.  Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, & green onion, served with sour cream. I didn't care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn't finish this tots.  We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake. Never leave Cheesecake Factory with out eating a cheesecake, that's too crazy! The grand finale : cheesecake, deciding on what cheesecake to get is the hard part, with tons of flavors to choose from, My wonderful hubby always lets me choose, we are too stuffed to have our own cheesecake.  For our anniversary cake, I went with the salted caramel, enjoying every delicious bite.  Note: for any celebration, Cheesecake factory will decorate your cheesecake, free of charge. About Cheesecake Factory:  *Established in 1978 by Evelyn and Oscar Overton *The first Cheesecake Factory was founded in 1978, in Beverly Hills, California, by David Overton *There are over 150 Cheesecake Factory locations *The success of The Cheesecake Factory is a great American success story Overall, we always enjoy our visits here at this Cheesecake location and looking forward to many more!

Dionne H.,"Chicago, IL",3,12,20,3.0,8/27/2017,"I spent Memorial weekend in Las Vegas. I had a great time people watching and outlet mall shopping. One evening before I noticed it was quite late and I needed to eat. I chose Cheesecake Factory because the food was familiar and reasonably priced. The service staff was friendly and attentive despite the late hour.  The most interesting part of the evening were the people around me like the loud, obnoxious men who kept shouting ""It's Trump's America"" or the girl who literally took a nap in the bread basket.

Angelo R.,"Miami, FL",795,475,4039,4.0,3/29/2017,"I know this is chain restaurant and have eaten at Coral Gables & Aventura locations several times but this Cheesecake is located inside the Cesar's Forum shops where diners can watch the Fall of Atlantis show for free. We sat on the terrace and it was great for people watching. Ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger (Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Onion Strings, Ranch BBQ). This burger was pretty enormous and mighty tasty. Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good. Service was swift and polite. Got seated in 5 minutes and food came in a timely manner.

Waitstaff was good with checking in, but our meal took 1.5 hours to get a salad and a steak. It wasn't the steak that was the hold up.. but the salad. Specifically the onions on the salad. I never received the onions after I asked for them to bring it out without them. My poor fiancés steak was lightly warm from being under the heat lamps waiting on my onions.

Shirley S.,"San Diego, CA",57,28,21,3.0,1/3/2018,Normally the service is at least four stars but being the afternoon of New Years Eve maybe they were short of cooks. Our order was taken quickly. She asked if we wanted bread and we said no. She came back with bread and said they only had wheat. Good thing because it was almost an hour later before we got our food. I ordered a small Caesar salad with no croutons...but it came with croutons. She offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait any longer. Quicker to just pick them out. We ordered lettuce chicken tacos and edamame. We were wondering why these items took so long to be served. We ended up asking for our cheesecakes to go to save time. Nothing wrong with our food but was kind of full because of munching on bread while waiting a long time.

Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,4.0,4/1/2015,"I recently tackled an ambitious multi-course dinner here, which was both stomach filling and palate pleasing.   For starters, I began with Crispy Fried Cheese, which was composed of a nice mix of both Mozzarella and Fontina Cheeses.  Following close behind were pan-fried Chicken Pot Stickers, which were satisfying doused in a Ginger & Soy Dipping Sauce, and SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls that were wrapped in Rice Paper along with asparagus and Shitake Mushrooms.  The cold, fairly wide (not particularly skinny) rolls were lip-smacking good dipped in  either a provided Chili Dip or Peanut Dip.  Next a large cup of spicy Tortilla Soup that would be labeled a ""bowl"" most everywhere else contained a pleasant but unusual concoction of rice- and corn-filled enchilada-flavored liquid.  Complimentary Brown Bread was excellent. Although by this time more food was hardly necessary, a packed California Cheesesteak that was filled with thinly sliced grilled steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese, and covered with sauteed mushrooms inside a toasted Ciabatta Roll, was nicely done.  Accompanying French Fries were good, and the Cole Slaw that went with Diane's Fried Shrimp Platter was cool and creamy.  Obviously there was no further room for dessert, so it was forsworn.         Delivery was late on Diane's ordered Root Beer.  Otherwise service was very attentive.  A California casual atmosphere well suited my choice of sandwich.   XXXX-1/2 Overall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=80

Soo C.,"Las Vegas, NV",128,170,109,3.0,11/11/2016,"I was here last night to have a dinner with my friends as they were craving pasta. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate. After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well.  The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods.  Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks.  Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=40

Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",990,1138,6858,4.0,3/27/2016,"When in Rome do as the Roman's do. A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show.     It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially true considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office.     This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting  place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis""? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to offer the texting or beeper system.     The Cheesecake Factory is a spacious and attractive restaurant that includes tables overlooking the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show. The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant.     The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.   The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It's just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.    I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid. In conclusion, Julius Caesar would be proud of the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=40

Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1716,2662,4.0,1/4/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's over-priced. But it sure is tasty. And there are so many food, drink, and dessert options. I can dine forever on just appetizers here. This particular location is nestled in the Caesar's Forum Shops. It's rarely too crazy busy where there's a wait. I prefer dining on the faux ""patio"" so I can people watch the mall. And you can sorta see, albeit mostly hear, the free show thingy that happens at the fountain / fish tank out front of this location. Service was decent. A bit scattered. But attentive and friendly enough. On my visit here, they were out of buffalo blasts. Which was incredibly sad as those are the absolute most greatest thing ever at Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are the best take on buffalo wings my taste buds have had the pleasure of enjoying. But it wasn't a total dismal thing as there was a new (at least to me) menu item - buffalo chicken meatballs. They were just like the buffalo blasts, but in meatball form. Extremely tasty. The mac 'n' cheese bites were also a hit. The Cheesecake Factory really does do this trendy appetizer better than most. All the other appetizers we sampled were tasty too, but less memorable and crave-worthy. All in all, there are far better, more unique, Vegas-specific places to throw down your money for good eats. But when you need to please a crowd, have a specific craving, everywhere else is full, and/or you just need to get off your feet and eat right now and you're right by here... It's better than most other chains and it's got decent people watching.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=40

They were packed for a Sunday, but we were seated quickly. My chicken and avocado club was standard, not a huge fan of the fries, but they were decent. My fella got the catfish, which seemed like an odd choice and he didn't care for it and ended up eating half of my sandwich instead. We also took a pineapple upside down cheesecake, which was really good and had lots of nice big chunks of pineapple in it. The food was standard and service was as well.

She was quick to bring by anything we asked for and was very helpful with helping us decide what we wanted to order.

We ordered: 1) Calamari was well deep fried and cooked but no real flavor by itself or with sauce. 2) Ahi tartare was very small and only for one person. Had a lot of avocado, more then ahi tuna and the sauce was just right with the wonton chips. 3) Buffalo wings were good and well deep fried with ranch. 4) Fried Zucchini was good and well cooked. Love their ranch as it seemed homemade. 5) Loaded potato tots were good and filled with bacon,cheese,potatoes,etc but you can only have so much. I could not eat too much of this as it almost made me sick. 6) Plain cheese cake with warm chocolate sauce is always my fave! My rating is more a 3.5 stars but had to round up.

Janae B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,4,,1.0,8/13/2017,"I've gone to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in the past, but I've never experienced what I experienced yesterday. After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in.  The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, ""No."" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said ""no you can not"" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he ""wasn't about to send any food back because it was too soupy."" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn't resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn't like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn't be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said ""don't forget to pay for these."" We hadn't had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn't want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn't have pay for the drinks that we never touched.  We left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=100

After asking for the enchiladas with ""no sliced up peppers or onions on top but sauces would be totally fine"" we received a plate with plain white rice, 3 flour tortillas and some plain unseasoned chicken breast. No tomatillo sauce or salsa at all. When we sent it back the restaurant manager came back 20 min later, mumbled something under his breath and slammed down the same meal, cold with some tomatillo sauce thrown on top.

My most recent time here I ordered the Renee Special. It is half of a sandwich, a bowl of soup, and a small side salad. All of it was great! The only thing is the salad was a little bland and only had leaves and balsamic vinaigrette. The soup was incredible! Cream of chicken with bacon bits on top.

We went out to celebrate an early Mother's Day dinner and ended up being a total waste of time. Horrible customer service for one! The host was rude and had this angry look on her face, expressing how much she hates the world and the people in front of her. We were seated quickly. Guess that was the highlight of the night. The server comes up and greeted us, ask if we would like some starters or a beverage. Took the order and came back 15 mins later, placed 2 of the 4 drinks on the table. Never gave us any straws... another strike in the books... came back 5 minutes after that to give us the other two drinks.

(Lame...) my mother in law then noticed a piece of stretch wrap melted in her pasta!!!!! The chicken in the pasta had no seasoning on it at all. My 4 cheese pasta looked as if it was sitting on the hot table baking for hours. We then called our server and brought it to her attention. She said sorry and sent the manager to our table. The manager apologized and said sorry, we wrap our chicken in plastic when breading the chicken to freeze it and that sometimes this issue happens. (Who says that?!!!) what kind of manager would explain to you that it just happens and sorry. He then asked if we wanna try anything else on the menu. We said no thank you and may we have the check please?. The server came back and said, I have something that will make you guys happy again!!! She then said I have dessert menus!!!! We said no thank you check please. She came back and said my manager took that one plate off your bill. The bill should have been discounted in total!!! None of us even finished our food after mom found that plastic!!! This location is really slackin.. I'm still replaying what the manager said to us in my head. (Yeah, sometimes it happens.)

I have heard about the restaurant very in depth through a class I am taking at UNLV and had to experience it first hand. For starters the atmosphere of this restaurant is very appealing! A nice calm lighting with a warm and welcoming feeling. If this is your first time, I recommend ordering an appetizer right away as it will take a good minute to look through the menu. This place has everything you can imagine and it all tastes amazing!  The food is mouth watering to say the least. The chefs in the back truly know what they are doing and really put their love and passion for cooking into the food. The waiters are also very pleasant and helpful. The prices for this location are very reasonable, especially considering its location along with the quality of the food.  If you haven't tried this restaurant and are considering it, do it!

Well it better be your cheat day because when I tell you that the level of calories in almost everything on the menu is threw the roof! I like this place because it reminds me a tad bit of the Grand Lux café. I am a cheesecake lover so the variety of cheesecakes that they have to offer are superb! The customer service here is always great from the many times I have visited. This location being inside of Caesars Palace so of course you know they have to step it up! For the food my friends and I ordered the Hot Spinach and Cheese dip along with the Fried Mac'n cheese bites for the appetizers. If you are into burgers at all look under the ""Glamburgers"" on the menu and try out the Macaroni and Cheese Burger! Sounds weird but trust me it has to be the best burger on the menu! Thai Chicken Pasta followed by the Miso Salmon were the remainder of dishes we ordered! Nobody had any complaints! I guess you can say it was a successful dinner, but wait.. that's not it! You can't come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get some cheesecake for desert! My favorite is the Red Velvet and Tiramisu!

When the second time I go back, I ask for their manager, and I tell him I need to drive one hour to come here each time, and I spend two hours on driving and waiting on phone for one hour just for take my bag back.  And then the manager said: you house is far away from here is not our fault, and you wait on phone for one hour is system's fault, not us. And he keep saying we are big company, we not going to steal your bag. But all I want is a apologize ok?

I told her you cannot round my bill up and short me money. She finally gave me back my change difference after a good five minutes. Poor customer service.  My second day the server I had brought us our waters with no straws and when we asked him for straws he put his finger tips all over the mouth pieces and then placed them in our drinks. I then told him we wanted sealed straws and he went and came back. During these three times he was at our table, not once did he ask us if we were ready to order he would look at our table and go to his other tables and help them. Very rude. I had to tell him we were ready to order and after a couple of times of me telling him we were ready he finally began to change his tune.

The wait can be long at times so we only come at odd times now.. I know people tend to hate on chain restaurants but I think CF is one of the better ones.. Their portions are huge and the food is tasty.  Must Haves: -Chicken Madeira: Everyone's favorite. Its just 2 chicken breasts with madeira sauce, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.. If I'm trying to watch what I eat I substitute the mashed potatoes for broccoli..  -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: It is not too overly spicy and has just the right amount of kick. -Chicken Lettuce Wraps: If I want something healthy-ish that's not a salad I get this dish.. It's huge so it will fill you up.. They even have noodles as one of the toppings. -Carlton Salad: It's tasty and fresh but the dressing has a very strong sesame oil taste so you may want to ask for the dressing on the side or another dressing. -Bread: Love their bread.. Especially the sweet brown one mmmmm haha -Strawberry lemonade: Sugar rimmed glass.. perfect for a hot Vegas day  Service is always friendly and it's a fun place to people watch after or before you shop at Forums~  HOT TIP: If you decide to get a salad you can swap out lettuce for mixed field greens free of charge.. yummmm ;]]]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=240

The portions are huge, food is pretty good, decent price for a restaurant, and the cheesecakes are amazing. Went here for a date night with my boyfriend one night. I never realized how huge this Cheesecake Factory is! Didn't expect it to be as big as it was. It's a little too dimly lit, in my opinion. We were seated near the kitchen area and given free bread. It was extremely cold in here...I wish I had brought a jacket. We knew the portions here are huge, so decided to share an appetizer of crispy crab wontons and one entree of the alfredo fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken. The crab wontons came out quickly. They were extremely hot and we burned our tongues on them. ): They tasted great though! The pasta came out soon after. The pasta was heavy and filled us up quickly. Even though we were sharing all of this, we almost didn't order dessert. ALMOST. How can you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?! We ended up ordering a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. It was delicious. Lots of gooey cookie dough pieces in the middle. We were only able to finish half of it because we were so full. The total was about $50, which isn't too bad for how full we were.

For dessert, I had their original cheesecake w/ Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream topping.... So good! The second I went was in sometime in the morning and all I wanted was another cheesecake so I sat down and said to the waiter: ""Cheesecake please.."" He recommended the Vanilla Bean cheesecake so I went with that and it was amazing! I wish we had one in Melbourne..

We went to the Cheesecake Factory, having never been to one before. As it was in Caesars Palace, I was expecting inflated prices, however I was pleasantly surprised with the menu pricing. The spinach, artichoke and cheese dip was great and the pizza and jerk chicken for main were both fresh and tasty. We took a slice of cheesecake to go (too full to eat after the starter and main) and it was lovely. The price level was decent, especially considering the quality of food you get. A good experience! Our waiter was fast and friendly and offered advice on the huge menu (I mean it when I say there is something for everyone!!).  My husband had the Meatballs, my sister had a pizza and I had a steak. All the meals were well prepared and very well presented. My steak was cooked as I like it, medium rare. Following the meal we chose deserts and again they were really nice, and surprising value. The low light was the Fettucine Alfredo. Very little sauce, very little flavour. Very disappointing. Both the meal and desert portions were large, perhaps a little too large for me and I have a great apatite. The portion and value are great here and the food is very decent, though not so much on the healthy side (they do have a 'skinny menu' meant for those who are calorie conscious). The service was excellent and our server was very conscientious, always making sure we had rinks topped up etc. All in all, the title says it all.

Ordered their Ribeye Steak medium rare with Mac & cheese and Mash potatoes. I judge a lot of restaurants based off of their ability to cook steak correctly. I'm no snob or highly experienced chef but cooking steak isn't exactly easy so if a restaurant can cook a steak properly, it gets major kudos from me. They not only cooked my steak perfectly but even the cut itself was of high quality. Maybe I'm exaggerating but it tasted and looked perfect.

The place is actually located at the very end of the Forum Shops, so it's the furthest distance from the casino floor, which is good all around. The service is great. I've never gone there with a party of less than 8 people, and my water glass has never been empty for more than a couple of minutes. The food is very good, and its presentation is terrific.

First off, you claim you have a full bar, yet you couldn't make a blood and sand. Then when I asked the waitress for a sazarac, she replied that she had no idea what that was before even consulting with the bar. When she did talk to them, they had o idea what it was either. Come onnnnn, thats America's first cocktail. Standard drink. I'm female and fresh out if college, and even I know what it is. A good bartender would've looked it up on their phone or have had a cocktail book stored at their register. After the huge ordeal, I succumbed to the firefly martini... It had tequila so I was good... For the time being... My mom had specifically ordered a medium burger. Not only was her burger late coming to the table, it was also a brick. When we told the waitress, she looked so annoyed with us, grabbed the burger plus my mom's fries, without asking. The very insincere manager came over to tell us he took it off the bill, and offered to grab us something else. Anywhere else would've comped the burger and whatever else we ordered for her wait. My fish and chips were decent...  Not mind blowing.  Extreme oreo cheesecake was far too sweet. Considering all the mishaps and the fact it was my mom's birthday, we would've appreciated a comp'ed cheesecake...

When our meals came out, one of the heuvos rancheros was really undercooked. We sent the meal back and it took another 20 minutes to get it back. Although the manager came over, he didn't apologize or anything. He just said, it will be out in two minutes...and it took another 8-10. In addition to this debacle, drinks took forever to come out and they forgot to give us basic condiments like syrup for our french toast. This was a really horrible experience.

I do not have fond memories of this location. I had a birthday here when I was a teenager, 7 out of 25 of us got food poisoning, and never looked back until now. Almost a decade has passed and a part of me cringed when my friend suggested going here. I wanted to go to the other place known for their desserts in the Forums, but she is allergic to chocolate.  Between three of us, we split the Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken Salad, and the Everything Pizza with kalamata olives and jalapenos. Overall, the food was decent. It is nothing spectacular. In fact, the only thing that is impressive about it is the sheer amount they give you.

Our server Loni was excellent. She was quite attentive to us. However, the bread she initially brought us was burned and really hard. Then, more bread came but it was cold. The better Cheesecake Factory restaurants normally toast the bread on the spot so that when the customer eats it, it is warm and soft, not cold and burned. I ordered from the special menu (the separate insert) where they have the chef's specialty items for that particular restaurant. I ordered the salmon with spinach and angel hair pasta. The salmon was excellent. However, their sauce was extremely creamy and oily. It was very overwhelming. If the sauce was replaced with let's say marinara sauce, it would have been perfect.

Greg H.,"Aurora, CO",72,336,81,4.0,10/25/2010,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. If you don't, then this is for you. You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking.  At this one in particular, you can be seated on one of three floors or even out in the forum shops where you can watch the fish tanks and the robotic Atlantis show. It's in the middle of all the forum shop stores at a dead end, so you really have to want to get there to find it. It's worth every second. I stayed in Vegas for a week for a convention, ate here 5 times then, and still didn't have the same thing. They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you. The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough. Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter.  The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Made-to-Order Guacamole, which was very good and came with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream - all of the necessary condiments to go along with chips! For an entree, I got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich, which had grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo on Toasted French bread. It's also served with jalapenos, but I asked that they don't put them on there, and I'm glad I did because this sandwich definitely had a kick to it.

Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1405,760,4.0,7/2/2010,"My husband  and I came here on our first date, some years ago, but we went to the Summerlin location where there was an hour long wait, and ended up here. I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait.  The service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd's pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn't seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband's dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish.  For both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria's Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops.

Second we got seated in a section where there was food on the floor and the server Shawn took over 20 minutes to even walk over and get our drink order. We were very upset by then because our two little girls were hungry and ready to eat. Then, once he came over he took our order for drinks and food at once, the good thing in our appetizer came out very quick which was a lifesaver. However, our food is a different story, it took SO long for it to get to us and when it did, my husband's rice was so hard and he sent it back to be replaced. After waiting for Shawn to get back to us to let him know about it he rice. The plate was brought back to much later with the same orange chicken which was cold by then with the rice replaced. As we were having our meal, finally, our drinks were not refilled and we had spent so much time there that the option of getting dessert was not even something we wanted to wait for so we got it at the cashier on our way out.

And speaking of options, there is something for everyone here. The menu is like a novel. I can see this being a great place for large families, because one person may want Mexican another pasta, etc. The service here was very good. They came to refill water often.

Margarita L.,"San Leandro, CA",11,111,,4.0,7/28/2012,"I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but I am in Vegas with my kids and I wanted a child friendly place to eat.  This was a pretty good choice.  We went there at 8 PM on a Friday night, and there was an anticipated 35 minute wait - but they gave us a piece of paper and told us to come back in half an hour.  That gave us time to check out the nearby stores and watch the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show right outside.  Unfortunately, it took an extra ten minutes before the anticipated time before we got seated and the kids were quite tired by then. The prices were pretty reasonable. My Monterey burger came with cheese, onions, arugula and avocado an was $12, plus an extra one to substitute the fries with sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, though not as juicy as I'd like it (I ordered it medium rare), but the fries were phenomenal.   My oldest had the pasta alfredo ($7), but she was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Unfortunately our waiter was too busy so we seldom saw him and we couldn't ask him for Parmessan cheese before she was finished.  My youngest had the kids cheese pizza ($6), which was the size of a regular dinner plate - basically, adult size.  The pizza tasted like an Italian pizza margherita rather than your typical American cheese pizza, so she didn't like it.  I, however, did.  All the portions were large enough that we all took leftovers to our hotel (which fortunately has a kitchenette). Of course, the only reason why the kids were willing to go to the Cheesecake Factory was the name, so we went on to have cheesecake.  The HUGE slices were $7 each, very reasonable IMHO, but I come from a city where food is grossly overpriced.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter fudge cheesecake, and I would not recommend it.  It was way too sweet to allow for any cheesecake flavor to filter through.  My oldest had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which she enjoyed.  I liked it more than mine because it was less sweet, but next time I'll go for the plain cheesecake.  My youngest had the kids hot fudge sundae ($2!).  It was a large enough portion that she couldn't finish it. In all, if you can deal with the wait and share dishes (or take the leftovers home for later), this seems like a good and reasonably priced place to dine in Vegas - no wonder there was such a huge wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=420

I'm always impressed when such a big and busy (and afforable) restaurant can produce food this good.  Be warned the location can be a bit noisy, and I definetly recommend being seated inside.

The service was great, Julia went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I had everything we needed.

Have previously eaten multiple times at the one in Orlando and they're both of same great standard. Food is reasonably priced, delicious and generous sized portions. In previous orders I've had the mushroom burger, Kobe burger, bbq chicken pizza and some sort of pasta and each dish was delicious. I've never had a bad meal here.  The service was fantastic too! I've tried the vanilla bean cheesecake twice, the carrot cake (not cheesecake) twice and the red velvet cheesecake once. The red velvet was the least favourite of mine but the carrot cake is probably THE best carrot cake I've ever tried anywhere and the vanilla bean cheesecake flavours are to die for, delicious!

Though it's location at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's is a bit inconvenient, the longest I've had to wait for a seat was 40 minutes even during busier seasons (once for a party of 11 and once for a party of 4). Both times I've eaten here, the service was impeccable, and of course the portions are huge, the food tasty, and all well worth the price. My friend swears by the Chicken Madeira, though I never order it because I don't eat mushrooms. The mac-and-cheese burger is delicious, as is the chicken burrito (though I would have preferred it to have shredded chicken rather than cubed). I also really enjoy the Flying Gorilla alcoholic milkshake. I don't eat here EVERY time I go to Vegas, but it's definitely a good option, and probably one of the better ones in regards to price - especially in the Forum Shops.

I fell in love the moment I saw this Cheesecake Factory. It was huge, and glowing with purple...it was majestic.  We had to wait 15 minutes, but that was okay, cause I just went into Express while I waited and then I looked at the fishies swimming around. I went inside and was greeted by this host who was full of life and really brightened my day as he led me to my table (I was having a bad day up until that point).  The waiter was even better. He was super nice and accomodating. He refilled my drinks before I even realized my drink was gone.  He boxed up our food and everything-something not all CF waiters offer to do. And is it just me, or does the Coca-cola taste AMAZING?!?!  The food-oh my Caesar (bad pun).

The dimmed lighting and private booths created a nice, cozy atmosphere which made our experience highly enjoyable.  We were presented with toasty garlic bread which we all loved. I tried quite a few entrees. I thought the pasta da vinci, garlic noodles, and chopped salsbury steak were all unimpressive, but the fettuccine Alfredo and Kobe beef burger were both very delicious! The fettuccine's creamy Parmesan sauce was very good, and the burger was a great value at just $12.99. Yum!

I went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn't judging the food at that age.  My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn't take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter???  We ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well.  And for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose.  All in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it!

The atmosphere was fabulous.  I liked their interior design ... It looked little bit different from many Cheesecake Factory's locations. We ordered:  Caesar Salad: Good ... I have to say not like the ones in LA, but was good really.  Fried Shrimp platter: Mediocre in my opinion. I was expecting something much better than what it came that night to me!

The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain and so  you probably either love it or hate it.  In my opinion, the cheesecake is top notch!  Their cheesecakes are rich and served in huge slices that will satisfy any sweet tooth.  However, since I was jonesing for a Fro Ho at Serendipity later, I skipped it this trip.  As for the food, well, it is what it is.  The menu is HUGE (if you haven't been there it is a spiral bound book!).  That is great for variety, but other than the cheesecake they haven't perfected anything.   This time out I had the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich with Hashbrowns.  It was good, not great.  They put tomatoes on the sandwich before they heat it so they get mushy.  Bleck!  The bread is good and the flavors work.   We had good service and they sat us on the second floor which was nice since it cut down on the noise.   Good lunch, nice easy stop in the Forum Shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=300

Kathleen T.,"Fullerton, CA",342,363,115,5.0,8/16/2013,"Never did I actually think going to The Cheesecake Factory would be one of my highlights of my Vegas trip recently for a convention. Not only did we have one of our better nights here, but we actually spent about 4 hours sitting at the bar. No lie. That was our second night in a row there.  Our first night, we came for dinner and didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table. We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like ""the guy from Jarhead"" aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn't regret it because it was a LOT. The only gripe I would have is that the rice was strange. I have no idea what was in it, but it was strange. He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service!  The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose & William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy's got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone's ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon & the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items). He can also make a mean ""Jolly Rancher"" shot! Jose was one of my favorite bartenders... basically ever. This guy's been bartending for 8 years, and you can really tell. He has an awesome attitude, a great smile, and is efficient as heck (he also bartends events, so if you're ever looking to find someone to do your event, he's your man!) He can make great conversation, tell some insane stories, but will still finish the hundreds of drink orders that are coming in. I feel like after the 4 hours we spent sitting at the bar, we made some great Cheesecake Factory friends. I wish this particular CF were local, but alas, anything in Vegas stays in Vegas, and I guess that goes for the bartenders/service we've had here.  Until we decide to have many more glasses of wine at the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops; cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=300

Everything on the menu tastes great and they even have a healthy menu although overall this place isn't the healthiest if you're watching your calories. Mostly comfort food but it's delicious. I want to add that the service here is awesome! I went here 4 or 5 times now and every time the service has been phenomenal. The staff is super friendly and genuine. They are also very receptive and come around very quickly to make sure you are taken care of. The only reason I'm taking off a star is because the cutlery was always just placed on the bare table which isn't the most sanitary thing. I would have preferred rolled up cutlery or at least placed on top of a napkin. Aside from that it's a great place to eat while staying in Vegas. Oh, one last thing.

My friends ordered a bunch of appies, but I wanted to eat some veggies... lunch special sized Cobb Salad it is. When they dropped off the bread, everyone pounced. Ahh, I love the soft, warm bread with butter... I didn't really need to eat anymore. The cobb salad is all mixed up instead of being a composed salad. It was very well mixed with an appropriate amount of dressing... not too little, not too much... just right. I love bacon... I love bacon with blue cheese... I love bacon with blue cheese and lettuce... this salad was huge, so I only finished like half. I would have taken it back to the hotel, but in a city of excess, I figured I would just find food someplace else... and I'm glad I did because I think our fridge was broken. The slice of red velvet cheesecake we took back did not fare so well... and melted. I almost cried.

Caroline J.,"Henderson, NV",182,123,42,4.0,3/19/2012,"In general, I try to avoid chain restaurants because if it is a chain I can eat their food all throughout the country. Also, I have seen Cheesecake Factory's gluten free menu and it contained close to nothing for me to eat without morphing the dish into something remarkably healthy (no sauce, dressing, fries, etc). Now, there are times that I want to be healthy, but that's why I cook at home, not when I go to a restaurant called CHEESECAKE Factory. Therefore, my fiance have avoided this restaurant in Caesar's until St. Patrick's Day when friends wanted something familiar to eat. First, the hostess desk was on top of their game. I got a piece of paper with my approximate waiting time and the time I checked into the desk. They took my phone number to call me when my table was ready which is GENIUS in Vegas. We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn't walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good. Our waters were almost always full, my friends got refills on the bread, butter and alcoholic drinks relatively fast and all went okay. The server split our bills with the greatest of ease since we told him at the beginning of the meal we'd prefer split bills. CF gets the extra 1 star for the host desk organization and service alone. Yes, this menu is impressive. Salads, pizzas, Chinese, Italian and of course, massive amounts of cheesecake. I looked through the menu and saw the plethora of carb-tastic happiness. I saw a stack of onion straws go by me and I remembered my days of gluten-ingesting intestinal pain. However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.  My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn't starving, I didn't want to be ill for the rest of the night.  Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple. The burgers did not look appealing to me, and I love beef, but then again, everyone except my fiance ordered their cow medium and that hurts my heart. My chicken? Hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone. Don't even get me started on the magic wonder of the lemon butter sauce. I could have clogged my arteries with more of that sauce any day. I didn't get sick from the restaurant, and that chicken may pull me back one of these days. Please feel free to take away the red mashed potatoes which were okay, but nothing exciting and almost didn't deserve to be on the plate with that butter and chicken. Replace the potatoes with more chicken and we're good. I know this one was long, but I like to approach a meal from all different angles. I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because for me, the GF options were severely lacking for a major chain restaurant, but what I did eat was great and the restaurant organization was on-point. If you want something that's not specifically Vegas but reliable and perfect for picky eaters, come to Cheesecake Factory and you'll be happy with your choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=460

Jacob M.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,225,22,4.0,9/13/2010,"Like other reviewers, I am not necessarily a fan of the chain restaurant. Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife's colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large. My first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions. As far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly.  Overall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won't be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don't look too closely at their bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=460

It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him.

Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one.....

Geoff S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",21,96,10,4.0,1/5/2015,"I'm not big on going to chain restaurants when in Vegas when there are so many great restaurants there. However it was getting late and I needed to get dinner at a place where I knew exactly what to what to order. Service was fast, but not too fast. I asked for only the whole wheat bread and they accommodated me. The only downside to the place was that I got no signal at all on my phone. I wasn't the only one with that problem.

Jane K.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,168,202,2.0,5/29/2015,"The food is mediocre. 10 years ago, this place used to be good, but now it's like an Applebee's with higher prices. The reason for even 2 stars is because of the service and the cheesecakes are great! I would only come here to eat a cheesecake. Other than that, the food is 1 star.  Here is my 2 cents. They have like 20 pages of food and it's like reading a damn book, trying to get through the whole menu and trying to figure out what you want. That's like a 10 min ordeal just going through all those pages and by that time, you really worked up an appetite. With such a huge selection, how does the company expect to make good food and perfect a dish? They can't with 100 dishes they have to cook and remember. Id just shoot myself if I was the chef and had to memorize that menu and try to cook it. Condense the menu and make at least one thing right and delicious.  The pasta I got was bland and said light marinara. It was drenched in Mariana and it was suppose to have a lemon and garlic taste. Didn't taste anything but bland tomato sauce. My bf got chicken and biscuits. The chicken was a joke. It looked like thin floppy slices that you get from a container to.make sandwiches. Im not even sure if it was chicken. McDonald's sells better and bigger chicken breasts. Seriously, the chicken looked so flat, it looked like a flat pancake. Very unappealing and unnatural.

Yet despite the many mishaps that happened during our meal, our waiter and the manager provided the best service possible and were very apologetic. They redid both our dishes wonderfully and served as a new basket of bread.

The atmosphere is very nice and service is okay depending on location. This  is located at the end of Forum Shops at  Caesar Palace (where the animatronic show  begins every hour).  They have at least 18 pages (including a whole page of cheesecakes to choose from) on the menu with a variety of items to choose from. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful in choosing the item she recommend. My mom and I both ordered Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane ($19.95 each)  and ordered caesar salad ($3 each). Our waiter brings our salad and  bread to our table. While I enjoyed the bread (especially the wheat bread) I didn't enjoy the caesar salad. The lettuce had bitter taste to it and the salad did not come with anything ( ex: cheese, onions, tomato,etc) that should be on it. I will say the ranch was delicious. About 30 mins later our waiter brought our entrees to our table.  The steak I had was tender and delicious and  the chicken Madeira  with cheese was average. My mom thought her food was good also.  For dessert, I ordered the original cheesecake which was yummy! This place get pretty pricey ($60 was the check for  two of us) but was worth every penny.

One of these dares was to eat food off of the plate of someone you did not know. Enter: the Cheesecake Factory. One of my friends decided to take this dare on and noticed a family getting up from their meal (children included). They had left some plates of half-eaten cheesecake on their table and she saw this as her opportunity. Before the family had even left, she walked up, picked up a fork and took a big bite of their cheesecake, smiled and walked back to our table. The looks on their faces were victory enough.

I definitely don't recommend their cream of chicken soup. Just a lil too watery and too many tomatoes floating around for my liking.  BUT, the vanilla bean cheesecake was ah-mazing. Their slices are gigantic so we had it split and the waitress was even nice enough to bring it on two separate plates (*kudos* to good service*).  So I think I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times (ok maybe not but...) and I've [so far] concluded the following: Yay: Chinese Chicken Salad, Fried Macaroni Balls, Meat Loaf, Pot Stickers, Club Sandwich, Terriyaki Steak, Pomegranate Margarita, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.

It was a really nice Cheesecake Factory since it was inside The Forum Shops at the Caesar's Palace. This one had an outside patio for dining with a view of the pretty fish tank! Nice! For this time around, I had ordered The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted bell peppers, red onions, melted mozzarella and garlic aioli on a toasted bun with a side of sweet potato fries. I asked the waitress if she would order my sandwich with the aioli on the side. When my dish arrive, I noticed that they did not place the aioli on the side (I am thinking that the waitress forgot to note it down), that  the eggplant was cut in quarters instead of being sliced thinly. What's the big deal, right? Well my Yelpers, trying to eat a chunk of an oily grilled eggplant inside a toasted bun smeared with garlic aioli and melted cheese and slippery grilled peppers makes it difficult to handle and eat. The eggplant kept slipping off my sandwich every time I took a bite. Hence, I decided to just take it off my sandwich and have a roasted pepper and cheese sandwich and eat the eggplant on the side. If they would change the cut of the eggplant, then the sandwich would definitely no be as messy to eat and enjoy, especially if you are paying like $15! I tried the Chicken Madeira from a friend's plate. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too salty or bland, perfect! I also tried her mashed potatoes and loved that you can taste real potatoes! Definitely not potatoes out of the box and then scooped onto your plate haha. Great portion for two meals! Now that's a bargain. My friend, however, ordered the plate with no asparagus and it came with it anyhow. Thus, the waitress forgot to note it down as well.  Overall, great dining experience! Service was okay since the waitress kept forgetting minor details and tried to get us to keep buying dessert even after we were obviously full and in a bit of a rush. She did bring us ton of bread to eat though. I",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=540

I would absolutely order this again, though I'm not much for salady wrap things. My flatbread was crisp and warm (it's hard to mess up a margareta pizza, and the Cheesecake Factory provided the standard delicious flavour I'm expecting.) The milkshake included caramel, pretzels, booze, ice cream, whipped cream. An insane indulgence but truly flavourful, and I highly recommend this if (like me) you love the sweet and salty combination. The FORVM Atlantis fountain show in the background can get irritating if you're not seated within the restaurant. (FFS, pick an heir to the kingdom already, aargh.) For a large-scale, affordable (for Vegas) chain-restaurant, Cheesecake Factory offered us surprisingly fresh food and efficient service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=400

But then I started ordering the MISO SALMON. & Oh my goodness!!! My new favorite dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, very moist, and was on top of a bead of rice. Surrounding the rice was some kind of creamy white sauce which was amazing and compliments the dish very well, along with chikapeas. I asked the server what sauce it was and she said its some kind of lemon sauce which didn't taste like it at all. Seemed like it has some mayo in it mixed with something else. My mom said it tasted like it had some coconut cream in it. I'll have to ask the server again.

Ron H.,"San Clemente, CA",55,46,86,2.0,5/2/2012,"It was our first night staying at Caesars and I was a bit worn out from the drive, so I didn't feel like going too far for dinner. At about 8:30 we went into the Forum Shops area and found a number of places that looked good. One of the last we ran across was the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't want anything that fancy and had dined at different Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times so we decided that this would be fine. We ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a Pizza. While we were waiting, all of a sudden, loud throbbing music filled the indoor courtyard. We asked the server what was going on and were told that the Nike store next door was having a promotion or kick-off of some sort. The music was a non-stop throbbing `new-age' sound which was NOT pleasant. The Pizza was eventually served, but w/out the Chicken Caesar salad. While sharing the pizza, the music suddenly stopped. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! Within just minutes there was an explosion and flames coming from the top of the aquarium in the center of the indoor courtyard. Then large animated figurines rose from amidst the flames and went into a `skit' for the people on the other side of the aquarium. It, too, was almost deafening w/ continued explosions and background sounds. As it was directed away from us we could not make out the dialog, just the explosions and screaming. Well, we're on our second piece of pizza and the manager comes to the table stating that the Chicken Caesar salad would be a bit longer. I told him to forget it. He asked if I was sure and I replied, 'yes'. So, as we're starting our 3rd (and last) slice of pizza... out comes the Chicken Caesar salad. Plop... not a word... and the server (not our waiter) walks away. I nibbled at it, but wasn't that hungry and left most in the bowl. Just as we are about to ask for the check the `skit' ends. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! The Nike noise returns... along with the check which includes the Chicken Caesar. I run down the server and recant my conversation w/ the manager. He says he'll look into it and after about 5 minutes returns with the check w/o the Chicken Caesar. At this point all we wanted to do was leave, so we didn't wait for change, leaving a 25%+ tip for service worth about 10% and an experience worth avoiding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=400

Service was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn't drenched in the dressing.

We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out.

I had the chicken piccata, which wasn't the best I ever had but it was fairly good. They gave me an absolute ton of food, which I could not finish. My boyfriend had the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, which he enjoyed. For the two of us (2 entrees, 1 cocktail, 1 soda, 1 appetizer), it came to $47 with tax, I believe. Not half bad.

Normally, I get here before it gets too crowded.  Sometimes I will have to wait, but it is worth the wait.  Will just wait and people watch or browse around some of the Forum shops til it is our turn. The menu reads like a small book.  It can get confusing at times cause everything sounds so good.  Every appetizer and entree that I have had has not disappointed.  All are above average, and the portions are huge so come hungry.   Of course, a meal here is not complete without dessert.  I will always save room for a slice of cheesecake.  If it means that I cannot finish my entree, then I will just take home the leftovers and enjoy it the next day.  I have tried over a dozen of their cheesecake flavors.  My current favorites are Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. I only have one complaint.  Stop discontinuing my favotite sandwiches.  They used to make a three cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich which was awesome.  They also used to make a Monterey Cheeseburger which was the bomb.  I truly miss those two items.   With that being said, every time we return to Caesars Palace, going to this Cheesecake Factory is a must.  Many good memories here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=160

I think this is at least my 30th time at cheese cake factory, it just always ends up being the go to place for food for the people in my life.  I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and man was it gear. Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious.  Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it's not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it's at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It's smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn't much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita.  I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it's called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish. I have yet to really understand the world of expensive food but I am getting there.  Also the bread. Gotta love a place the gives out free bread.  Overall, great place.

My favorite item has to be their chicken nachos...gotta try these! Main entree was the ribeye, seriously...for not being a steakhouse; their steak was cooked perfectly and had perfect flavor overall a perfect steak. I think they can give Flemmings and Ruth's Chris a run for their money as their steak is about $20 less and includes a side.

Griselle R.,"Placentia, CA",68,25,12,1.0,2/15/2017,If I can rate this a no star I would!!!! Worse customer service ever ..first we were waiting for ever for them to take our order . As we ordered our food I ordered Parmesan herb chicken and it comes with mashed potatoes and green beans I asked for corn succotash instead. We waited about 30 + for our food. Finally food came out my side of corn wasn't ready and server said just a few more minutes ... 10 minutes passed maybe even more nd nothing... finally the manager comes out and says they are all out of the corn succotash and what did I want instead .  At this time I was upset and told him to bring out fries. I didn't even eat the fries I was so upset that a busy resturant runs out of their own food. I waited about 10-15 min for our server to come out and to say they were all out. Then Our server never came back to check on us if we needed refills on our drinks . We finally got our check and I asked the server if I had to pay for the full plate since I didn't get a full plate bcz they were missing the corn and I never touched the fries. He said he would go talk to the manager about that . He offered me a free desert bcz he took for ever in helping us and he didn't check on us. He left and came back left the bill and took off really fast as we checked the bill we noticed that they charged me for the desert and then took it off. I waited for like 5 min and called him over as he was trying to avoid us. I told him to get his manager. He came out and I asked him if he was going to do something about my plate not being complete and his response was oh I already did ure taking the desert and I told him I didn't want the desert . And that the server said. He was giving us the desert bcz he didn't take care of us. And he said okay I didn't charge the corn and I told him he did bcz the plate was 17.50 and that's what I was getting charged. Then he said the corn was extra charge and I said I've never been charged extra for the corn and he said I can get the servers in trouble bcz they not charging right and I told him Ive always ordered this and have never been charged and he said o well ure lucky I dnt charge u. I told him I dnt want the cake the only reason I got it it's because the server said that was free bcz of his timing issue. He finally said he would take 5 buck off the bill. This manager was so not professional fighting w me instead of making a customer happy . I will never visit this place again. This managers name was Liam I think.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=140
Kathleen T.,"Corona, CA",6,27,1,1.0,3/21/2017,"I'm giving this place a star because we were just a party of 2 who wanted & tried moving to a booth for two when a waitress came up to us & said  to sit where they assigned us & we couldn't sit at the unoccupied booth without permission. I was like okay I was about to ask the host. The host said it was fine & guess who was our waitress for the booth? The same rude waitress who told us we couldn't sit there meaning that it was most likely a part of her section. In my experience as a waitress, if my guests wanted to move to another table in my section they would be more then welcome to & not scolded. The worst part of our experience was we ordered our food and didn't get it until about an hour later. After the wait, you would think the food would be prepared well but both of our pasta dishes were dry. We had our waitress bring it back & the manager Aaron brought it to us & apologized. This occurred after the screw up which took up to an hour plus of our time. After arriving at 10pm & not getting our food till 11:10pm we were tired & just wanted to leave because we literally were one of the last tables before close. Our food was packed with no silverware as well. It's sad because it was our first night in town & we were hoping to be about but this cancelled our plans.

Katherine A.,"Las Vegas, NV",333,150,1660,4.0,1/12/2015,"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 10/100*** I've always been a fan of this place for those occasional calorie indulgence. We had family stay at Caesar's so we decided to dine in house. With reservations made ahead of time, everything was smooth sailing. I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I've tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it's chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must've noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn't feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush. When the bill came and noticed the mac and cheese was not taken out, he gladly rectified the situation which in turn we added to his tip as we appreciated the effort and kind gesture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=140

They finally seat us after 15 minutes (as we are still waiting for the 2 in our party). They give us 2 booths back to back. We wanted a table together. We saw 2 tables so we asked our waitress if we could connect the tables and sit together so she went to go ask. In the meantime we start setting up the tables. The manager (Amid which refused to give us his full name) walks up to all EIGHT of us (this is the first time I've seen this man) with an attitude and starts saying very rudely get up, no this is not what we agreed on either move tables or don't dine with us and get out. My sister calmly says we did not agree on anything and I have never seen you before. I dealt with the hostess. He says no no no and does not let my sister finish her statement as were walking away my brother asks what is your name I'm leaving a review he says Amid we then ask what is your last name he then proceeded to say I will not tell you we go back and forth for five minutes then says get out or I'll call security.

Usually we wait a good thirty minutes at the Boca Park spot. We got a table for two outside of the restaurant so there was some really good people watching.  This is RIGHT outside of the Caesar's show thing they do so it did get a little darker and noisier when the show was happening but it doesn't last TOO long.  Camille had her usual, Bow tie pasta in marina and loved it.  And I ordered my usual: Chicken Chipotle Pasta. I felt like it wasn't as spicy as when I usually get it and it was definitely saucier, watery if you will. It was still delish but I've had it on better days.

No, it doesn't have the charm and the allure but it does offer a wide ranging menu that is sure to please, decent service, and most off all: consistency.  The menu is overwhelmingly large. Whether you want appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees, or more they will have it. Tacos? Shepherd's Pie? Chicken Milenese? Yes, they have it available on their menu. While it won't be the greatest you ever had, it certainly won't be disappointing and offers decent flavors.  Service was good and like other locations, its saving grace. We were the last party to be seated and they didn't hesitate to be of service nor did they try to rush us. They were attentive and water glasses never went empty.

And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word. Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead ""I hope you enjoyed your meal!"" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes. Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, ""just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?""  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=280

Me and my friends typically make our way to this place around 9 or so, about an hour before it closes and the place is usually not that crowded, or winding down. We seem to typically get our food faster this way. But screw the food, we all know I come here for the cheesecake. I've had the red velvet, the chocolate godiva, the tiramisu, and jacked some banana creme from my friends plate. No not in one sitting you asshole, over multiple visits! I've never had any complaints. It's so delicious that even if I'm too full after a meal, I'll still take cheesecake to go. Chocolate Godiva cheesecake is the cheesecake of gods and it descended from the heavens into this restaurant and if you don't eat it, you're wrong. Forshame! The food can be hit or miss. Typically their Asian cuisine is pretty spot on. It may not be authentic, but it sure is tasty. I think the only bad thing I've ever really had here is the chicken and biscuits. It's like, swimming in gravy, and I hate soup. Their veggie burger is kinda sad too, just fell apart in my hands. Steak is definitely the way to go. The alcoholic drinks are good game too. While a bit pricey, I can slurp down 4 of those orangy-fruity things before the meal gets there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Erica D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,29,6,5.0,3/11/2016,"A friend and I decided to have dinner here for our last night in Vegas and thank God we did because it was excellent from start to finish! We waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated, now there was only two of us but still it was nice not having to wait that long. Once we got our seats our waiter  came over and right away suggested some drinks since we were looking at the adult beverages (of course, hello we're in Vegas!) he told us the new blood orange margarita was great so we both went with that. SO good!!! I wish I would've gotten my waiters name because he was awesome! I ordered the combo of the steak Diana with salmon and it was delicious. The salmon didn't have the least bit of that fishy taste that most salmon has, the steak was perfect and the mashed potatoes were great too! Of course we got cheesecake as well, I got the s'mores and my friend got red velvet. One great thing after another with this place! I will say that when you're going to a Cheesecake Factory make sure you at least have an idea of what you'd like to eat because they have a huge selection on their menu so I don't think you wanna take the time and read each item with description on there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Michael P.,"Rogers, AR",11,4,1,1.0,7/14/2015,Stopped here while at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  The service is very slow at this location and burger was delivered undercooked after giving specific instructions to my server for well done preparation. I hope more staff will be hired and trained to become better communicators so future patrons will not have a poor experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Sheena R.,"Riverton, UT",3,13,3,5.0,7/11/2014,This place is by far my favorite !!!! I ordered the fried Mac n cheese and onion rings !! I was so full I didn't have room for cheese cake :( the staff was fast and friendly and the place was very clean and inviting!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Denise V.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,106,20,4.0,3/8/2015,They don't take reservations per James but he said for a party of two it would not be more than a 10 min wait. Ok we will see. Great service and great food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Meagan R.,"Durand, MI",0,28,,3.0,7/5/2015,"Surprisingly there was no wait and we got sat right away. The service was a little slow but it was also really busy. Our bread came out right before we got our food. I always get chicken farfalle because it's my favorite. Maybe it was because it was really busy but the sauce was super runny to the point it was almost soup. The noodles seemed a little hard as if they weren't cooked long enough. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Skj T.,"El Segundo, CA",22,517,32,5.0,3/4/2015,Service is amazing here! It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside which is nice because we didn't have a wait time to be seated . Love the dishes here. Fresh and top quality .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Melena R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,5.0,3/18/2016,The chicken samosas were bomb. The bread is dangerous because it's so good. Great place for drinks and hanging out with friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Katherine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,233,532,3.0,4/28/2013,"I usually try to avoid going to the Strip as much as I can when visiting, because I hated being around the strip when I lived there, and I sure do not love it even now. However, my friends insisted on going to the Cheesecake Factory for brunch, and I haven't actually eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before (except that one time I tried their cheesecakes, which were pretty good), so sure, why not. Located inside the Forum Shops at the Caesars Palace, this is definitely a touristy place. It's huge with lots of seating and it's located right in front of that aquarium thing with the show every hour or so. Actually, we chose to seat outside, and one of those shows started playing, which could be a bit annoying since they dim all the lights and it's really loud.  Anyway, back to the food. I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn't too sweet either, which I really don't like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing! It was ok, didn't blow me away, but wasn't disappointing either. The service was great. Our server was patient with us and regularly refilled our drinks. He even informed me that my food was going to take a while to be served, since the first batch got burnt. I definitely appreciated him letting me know that.  Overall, food was decent and priced not outrageously. Service was nice! It's definitely one of those touristy places though. So if you're visiting, this would be a great place to dine. However, if you don't like touristy places, or just don't like being at the Strip, then you might want to consider someplace else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Rich T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,1,2.0,6/25/2015,"Cheese cake factory is way over rated the spinach appetizer was very bland wasn't even salted, $8.50 for a little glass of wine also had the factory burger which was nothing but ground beef and sautéed onions on a Italian club roll that tasted like old bread that was warmed up in a microwave by the time I get down to my last couple of bites I could barely bite into the bread it was so hard The french fries were not fresh either they dried up real quick, my sisters chicken club sandwich was just okay. So appetizer one factory burger/ fries one chicken club sandwich/fries one glass of wine two glasses of iced tea and one slice of  Lemon meringue pie which I might add was very very good $72 with tip included overrated and expensive. To be fair this review does not pertain to the cheesecake factory location on Las Vegas Blvd., South, I was reviewing the cheesecake factory in Green Valley In Henderson I just could not find it in the database",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Tina W.,"Flushing, NY",621,155,411,1.0,2/2/2013,"**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice. The Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Garth R.,"Irvine, CA",16,111,61,4.0,1/18/2015,"Never been b4 but I'm going back for sure.  Great prices even in Lost Wages, I mean Las Vegas.  4 ate dinner with desert and one cocktail and it was 80 bucks and change.  The menu selection is outta control.  Too much to choose from IMO.  Service was very good and the cob I had was one of the better I've experienced. The fresh lemonade was excellent with a sugar rim and the lemon drop good sized and very tasty too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
Kim W.,"Biloxi, MS",24,119,153,3.0,1/5/2014,Service here isn't bad. The food is pretty decent. We decided done here bcz we couldn't make up or minds. This is what we finally agreed on. It's late. We're all hungry. The food here is generally consistent. We dine here bcz it's a familiar restaurant chain.  Don't ask me for a particular dish. I always order different.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-las-vegas-3?start=320
