Ahashta J.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,31,12,5.0,12/10/2016,Love to come here with a big crowd!  We order different stuff every time and get to share!  My husband and I love to get the chicken tequila and add broccoli rabe.  This time we got the Jamaican jerk pizza and avocado rolls.  Both were great!  Fried macaroni was only so-so.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20
Brenda J.,"West Norriton, PA",13,78,435,4.0,6/20/2015,"This is based on my takeout experience: I literally sat in the parking lot and placed my order online.  I then walked into the restaurant about 5 to 7 minutes later.  Upon entering the restaurant the greeters we're very energetic and full of smiles.  I was then instructed to walk a few feet to the take out area where I was greeted by a young man smiling and hospitable.  Overall, I was impressed by the energy in the restaurant more than anything in spite of my waiter stating it was a slow night.  It made me really consider dining here. I really didn't expect much with my spaghetti bolognese because it was prepared so quickly but was taken by surprise from the great flavor.  I almost ate the entire meal but had to stop.  I will finish it for breakfast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20
Parvinder H.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",86,201,113,2.0,1/1/2016,"With only a 15 minute wait at lunchtime we were feeling great about our visit, that is until they showed us to our seat. It was plenty comfortable, but it was on the way to the bathroom so we had the pleasure of people watching as they entered the toilets, then watch several men zip up on the way out, which leads me to question whether they even washed their hands on exiting. This was also the thoroughfare for the bus boys taking away dirty plates as well as one of the main routes for taking food to other patrons. We could see into the kitchen and the floor did not look like it had been cleaned in a week. We watched our plates sit for an age on the counter and when the food got to us it was almost cold to the touch. Pizza that is luke warm and limp is a sad state of affaires. Also as a general tip, when a patron asks for mushrooms, generally it's for the whole pizza not just one slice.  The guy serving us, Dave, was friendly and if it wasn't for this I'm not sure they would have gotten more than one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20
Regina M.,"Ardmore, PA",162,375,556,4.0,11/27/2014,"I've said before that I believe that good chain restaurants have a place in this world. I am all for local, and I'm all for predictable.  CPK is one of those national chains that gets it pretty much right. We have an international student living with us this year, an enjoyable experience where the Young 'Un gets to know a peer from another culture and they likewise do the same.  We'll call our student Mayday, for their favorite band.  Mayday is a foodie. Loves food.  Loves all kinds of food.  Not at all afraid to have something new, and also to share their home food with us.  It's a very good fit.  We happened to be in the KoP mall one day.  Headed over to CPK for their famous (and rightly so) BBQ chicken pizza.  A huge hit.  Sweet and tangy and crunchy and mmmmmm.... We also had the Kung Pao Spaghetti which was an interesting twist, very good too.  Did not expect an Asian style dish in a pizza place but hey, it works. Only forgettable note was the salad, which was seriously ""meh"".   Service was very attentive and friendly from Cierra, who effortlessly had us signing up for their 'club', something I rarely do but didn't mind doing this time thanks to her skillful sales pitch.  I hope she gets a bonus for that.  I am not easy. CPK, nice to visit a favorite 'on the road' restaurant when I'm not 'on the road'.  I love your consistency and your quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20

Rula R.,"Eagleville, PA",325,320,313,5.0,10/28/2015,"I have been to hundreds of restaurants and experienced all types of customer service but when it came to CPK, the experience was extraordinary. We got seated once we got there on a Thursday evening and the host told us about the happy hour specials and also the form to fill to receive emails for birthdays and special offers. I ordered roasted veggies salad and it was very big, very good and very filling. I tried the pizza that my friends got and it was very tasty (I promised I will get that after my diet) I think so far this is was the best customer service experience I have ever received at a restaurant.

Lydia B.,"Wayne, PA",192,221,756,2.0,6/9/2015,"I'm not exactly sure what is happening with California pizza kitchen's soup situation... But they need to revamp it ASAP. I ordered a lunch combo that came with some somewhat lame choice is for soups. I settled on one that advertised vegetables etc. etc. but when I got it it was bland and oddly very greasy with an aftertaste of ham hock. The Very nice waitress gave me another soup which was the tortilla soup, something my daughter likes, so I gave it a shot. This leads me to my question...asking why does California  pizza kitchen  have consistently great barbecue chicken chopped salad and yummy pizzas but failed miserably on this section. Why is no one fixing this issue? Seems like The split pea soup has been on the menu since its inception along with a baked potato soup... time to spruce up the choices. I was not impressed.  I believe California pizza kitchen wants to be a chain that has fresh choices and I've enjoyed their pizza throughout the years. I will no longer enjoy their soup until something changes. The soup made the restaurant feel more like a chain then a cool California cafe. Better luck next time.,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20
Terri K.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,15,,4.0,6/8/2016,"Love this place!  When asked where we should eat out - kids always pick this over McDonald's or Burger King, or even Chic-Fil-A.  They love their kids meal with the BBQ chicken pizza.  My favorite is the BBQ Chicken Chopped salad- love it!  Just the perfect blend of ingredients and it's not super heavy.  You feel great after you leave not like you just ate way too much!  We like to do take out as they are generally pretty busy but when we have eaten in the servers were all very nice.  They redid their restaurant a while back and now you can fit even more customers inside.  Their previous manager Jean was phenomenal - not sure about the new manager but this place is top notch so I am sure they are equally as great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=20

Aneyceia B.,"Puyallup, WA",3,8,,5.0,7/27/2015,"I can honestly say that this was a five star experience. This was my first time at a California Pizza Kitchen and I was delighted by the wonderful service. I was instantly greeted the moment I walked in. Dave was our server along with Andrew who I believe was in training. The both of them were wonderful servers, very kind and attentive. The general manager even came by after they told her it was my first time and gave us a coupon for a free small plate. The atmosphere was very welcoming. The variety of the menu was terrific and I had a difficult time deciding. Dave told my party that we were able to split the pizza into two favors for an extra dollar. Since neither of us could eat a 10in by ourselves, we went ahead and split the pizza and shared it, which ended up being a great deal.  I ordered the Crispy Mac n Cheese assuming it would be normal fried mac n cheese. When the server put the plate in front of me I'll admit I was a little afraid. I was delighted to find that it was absolutely delicious! I also ordered the Original Barbecue Chicken pizza with bacon instead of chicken and no onions. The pizza lived up to expectations and was excellent.  I was very pleased with my overall experience. My only regret is that there isn't any CPKs in my area and this will have to be a rare experience. Definitely looking forward to coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40
Lauren S.,"Flemington, NJ",1,57,4,5.0,3/13/2016,"Came here on a busy Saturday night with no wait. Our waitress was Grace and she couldn't have been any more awesome. She was engaging, attentive, and helpful when picking out our menu choices. If you're a drinker I would recommend their blood orange sangria (careful- it's strong and you'll want seconds!) The food was also very good. Between the four of us we split the dumplings and the avocado rolls (amazing). We all got a personal pizza and they were delicious. The manager checked in with us at the end and asked how our waitress was and how the food was, and we had zero complaints.

Megan A.,"Coopersburg, PA",123,28,76,2.0,1/5/2014,"This place is just ""eh"". I will start off by saying there were several good things about this place. First off, our service was great! Our server specifically was just overall really nice and easy going, something that definitely makes any experience more enjoyable. Everything came out fast and was still hot (a very good sign) and the atmosphere is really natural and modern. Really cool music too!  The menu has a pretty good selection, a lot of different pizzas, salads, pastas, etc. to try.  The food came out and the presentation was really nice, however, I am giving it only 2 stars because the pizza is just mediocre. I have definitely had my fair share of pizza and I can find much better some place else. I was satisfied with everything else, but I am all about the food when I go somewhere to eat (like most) and was thoroughly unimpressed. I won't be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40
Tiffany M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,2,4.0,3/12/2016,"This is my first Yelp review and I was compelled to write it because of the excellent customer service I received while dining here.  My boyfriend and I ordered apps (chicken dumplings and guacamole and chips) and both were good, especially the dumplings. We both ordered different pastas as our entrees and weren't too impressed with their flavor. We didn't complain to our waitress, Nina. We just told her the dishes were ok when asked and that we didn't need any to go boxes.  Well unbeknownst to us, Nina told one of her managers, Kanisha, that we weren't very happy with our entrees. Kanisha immediately came over with the sweetest disposition and probed us about what we didn't like about the pastas, what could have been different about the way they were prepared and if we wanted them cooked over or a replacement meal. She was super nice and when we declined another entree, she suggested we try a dessert, which we did and it was delicious! (Tip: get the butter cake with ice cream...yum!!!) We received our bill and it only included our drinks and apps. We were very pleased and b/c of the awesome customer service we received, we will be returning to CPK - and next time for the pizza, as everyone we saw looked delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40
Mike W.,"Philadelphia, PA",66,184,1037,3.0,1/20/2014,"While I am am a much bigger fan of non chain restaurants, this is definitely one of my favorite chain places. The pizza varieties are interesting and tasty, as are the salad choices. Its a great place to grab a bit when you are on the go. My fiance and I grabbed some lunch here this past weekend while we were in between places where we were registering for wedding gifts. I hadnt been to CPK in a really long time, so when I looked at the menu, I found some surprises. They definitely had a lot of new offering since the last time I was there, and they had a few gluten free and while wheat choices for those trying to eat healthy or those who have allergies, which is always nice to see. We decided on splitting the habanero carnitas whole wheat pizza and the roasted veggie salad. Both were very tasty. Loved the heat from the habanero sauce, and definitely appreciated that it was on the side instead of all over the pizza so it could be added to taste. The carnitas were very tender and flavorful. Loved the whole wheat crust, just wish it had a bit more crunch to it. The salad was really filling and full of tasty options. Artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, eggplant, avocado and peppers call came togehter nicely in a light dressing. Loved it. Good service as well. Be careful if you are trying to eat healthy though. There are lots of calories hidden in their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40

Forget that. The wait was 45 minutes at 9:00pm. So we looked for something. We passed California Kitchen when we entered the mall, so we gave it a shot. Food was fantastic, servers were very attentive, our server was even training a newbie. We were also greeted later on by the Manager on Duty as well as the General Manager. We were asked to sign up for their Pizza Dough loyalty card, but we explained that this was the closest CPK and it was a three hour drive.  Wonderful food, wonderful experience, we would stop in again if we were in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40
Sara R.,"Harrisburg, PA",3,19,10,4.0,2/13/2015,"CPK always is a pleasant place to go relax and have a good meal.  I had the avocado and bacon pizza with arugula. The bacon was very crispy and flavorful. Unfortunately the avocados were very under-ripe and therefore inedible. The server gave us guacamole to replace the avocados. The pizza was very good, and I would pick it again.  We shared a BBQ chicken salad which was great. No complaints there...I would definitely get this again. We had Mac and cheese bites for an appetizer. These needed a lot of work...think ""easy mac"" fried into balls. Not very good, just bland and unappetizing.

Jen L.,"Boston, MA",22,74,11,5.0,10/9/2014,"Seriously, for being a chain store in a huge shopping mall, it doesn't get much better than this. My mom and I came here for lunch while we spent an entire day at the mall shopping for wedding shoes (hooray!) A day of shopping is exhausting, so it's usually best to start off with some food and a drink! We decided to pop into CPK for salads and maybe some wine. They had a pretty awesome selection of salads for being a pizza place (and hint: order a half salad--they're huge!) We both ordered a cobb salad. I wanted to add figs to mine, and our server said no problem. I wish I had a copy of the receipt because I don't know his name, but he was wonderful. When we were looking over the drink menus, I was considering the blood orange sangria. I wasn't sure if I would like it but our trusty server said it was amazing and he normally doesn't even like sangria. My mom and I both decided to go for it and honestly it was one of the best things I've ever consumed. I want to go back if for no other reason than to drink blood orange sangria.  I wonder if I could order that by the pitcher? In sum, the service was prompt, the drinks were delicious, the salad was perfect, and we had a really great lunch in the mall (a difficult feat to accomplish, at times!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40

Greg L.,"Collegeville, PA",71,747,928,2.0,11/3/2012,"It pains me to rate CPK only 2-stars, because in general, my family loves the food here. We typically eat at a CPK about once a month and I have to say that service at this location has been steadily declining. We were here most recently to celebrate my son's 7th birthday. CPK is one of my son's favorite places and for the past several years, he picks this place for this birthday dinner with the family. We arrived around 5:30 and there was no wait, so we were quickly seated. Our waiter was over pretty quickly and took our drink order. He came back with our drinks and then took our food order, and from there it pretty much went downhill. I asked for bread when we placed our order. After about 10 minutes of it not coming out, I flagged him down and asked again. This time he did finally bring it out. Throughout the whole night, we had to flag him down to get refills (and he wasn't always easy to flag down) and I went through most of my meal with nothing to drink. He never came and checked on us once during our meal! Close to another 10 minutes passed between when we finished eating and when he came over to ask if we wanted desert. I ordered the kids brownie for my son and told him it was his birthday. He then proceeded to walk away and I was like, whoa, we wanted to order some desert as well. While we ordered the rest of our deserts, I mentioned two other times it was my sons birthday for a total of three times. Like a suspected, his desert came out with no candle and even my son asked me where it was. I was so disappointed. I got ahold of another waitress and asked if they still did birthday candles and she said yes. She got ahold of our waiter and a few minutes later he comes out with a candle and tells my son to close his eyes while I put the candle in the brownie and lit it. Obviously, it was after the fact and didn't have the same impact. We never saw a manager walking around or otherwise I would have flagged them down to complain. While the food was good, the service was horrible. UPDATE ON 11/29/2012: After my very disappointing experience, I wrote an email via their website. You would have thought someone would have at least called me to apologize or something, but after a month, I've heard absolutely nothing from them.

Unfortunately, I asked for a Thai salad with no peanut chunks and got the salad with lots of peanut chunks. Waitress never came to ask how things were, so I continued to pick out and eat. Finally I told her that there were so many peanuts when I was almost done. She got the manager (Sandy, I think) and she offered to pack a salad to go.

The taste hasn't changed in so long. Food - the fusion concept is great. The Thai crunch salad  for appetizer and Chipotle chicken pizza , no chicken is a veggie paradise Service - the service impeccable. For vegetarians, when you request no meat they substitute avocado for chicken. Ambience - ask for a booth.

Mel P.,"King of Prussia, PA",81,101,490,4.0,3/18/2017,"Grabbed an early dinner here with my husband last Saturday evening. We arrived a little before 5pm, so there was very little wait time. That said, it was constantly hopping while we were there, as it always is.  Our server was Grace, who was incredibly friendly and attentive. I'm not sure why we did not have silverware until after our appetizer was served, but she was quick to notice and remedy the situation.  I'm a long-time fan of the food at CPK. It always makes me happy to see many original favorites on the menu, such as the spinach artichoke dip, ""Two in a Bowl"" soup options, BBQ Chicken salad, and of course, all the awesome pizzas. Lots of fun, new choices, too! We started with the Sesame Ginger Dumplings. I think they went a bit overboard on the sesame seeds, but the sauce is amazing -- perfect flavor with a little kick. For our entree, I got the Thai Chicken Pizza on wheat crust and he got the Thai Crunch Salad. Both were loaded with fresh ingredients, and the pizza was the perfect temperature. (Side note: He added avocado, which was an odd combo that he regretted in hindsight.) He also enjoyed a Strawberry Mango Cooler, which was refreshingly delicious, but very sweet and had way too much ice. Overall, the visit was nothing special but still decent.

My partner and I shared the spinach artichoke dip which is amazing. They give a generous portion of dip - so much so that we ran out of chips before we could finish the dip (which isn't a bad problem to have). The server also brought us over some fresh bread and olive oil. My boyfriend got the shrimp scampi and I had the Sicilian pizza. We both really enjoyed our meals. The pizza was great - lots of high quality Italian meats on there. It was pretty spicy so watch out if you're sensitive to that. I love it spicy! The pizza was thin crust and a ""personal"" sized pizza, which actually looked more like a medium sized pizza to me. I managed to get two meals out of it. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert.

While California Pizza Kitchen still remains the forgettable dine-in option, it's still a go-to when visiting KOP mall.  Our waitress may have been super busy or just a new waitress in general. My friends who both ordered the same strawberry lemonade received two different drinks. The waitress who stood above us as my friends spoke aloud that they ordered the same drink but received different drinks quickly walked away. Of course not before spilling part of the drink across the table. WOMP. Rookie mistake.  On the back side of the menu you'll notice a lunch special available Monday-Friday with deals ranging from $10.99 to $12.99. I opted for the pizza and soup combo. Because carbs on carbs is better than no carbs or carbs and veggies. EWWWW.  Mushroom Sausage Pepperoni Pizza: At least the dough was good. I'd say there wasn't enough cheese on my pizza but overall it was a solid 3/5.  Baked Potato Soup: Did not finish. Tasted like flour. The end.

Pratik J.,"Overland Park, KS",13,66,28,2.0,7/24/2016,"Pizza chain with diversified menu. Went here on a summer evening.Have been here quite a few times but this one was the worse. Appetizers - Baja chicken tortilla rolls. Quantity and size of the rolls has decreased since last time and doesn't at all reflect the amount of money they are charging you. Doesn't make you feel at all worth it. Guacamole is not exciting at all. Dinner (Main Course) - Two salads, Chinese chicken salad and Thai crunch salad. Chinese chicken salad was already soggy when it arrived , not to mention it took like forever to come. Our server looked too drained out but was courteous.  Thai salad was alright. Quantities have definitely decreased and not as tasty.  When we were finished with our salad, nobody wanted to come and get the plates or at least some water for almost 20 minutes. One glass of water was all I got which annoyed more when I saw our server standing at the bar and flirting/ talking with the bar tender. After much deliberation we asked another server to ask our server for the check. Finally after a long wait we were relieved and he got us the check.  Disappointed.  Overall - Our table was rocking which spilled all the water from our glasses on to the table, server was lazy and busy talking to there bar tender for more than 15 mins. Very slow service.

Lesser said about the outer crust, the better. It's definitely a test to see if you are dentally challenged soul.

Joe C.,"Haverford, PA",85,111,54,3.0,1/1/2013,"This place is the restaurant equivalent of a chick flick. Totally geared toward a female audience who sometimes drag the men in their lives with them. But every once in a while I agree to go because the wife likes it and they have a thoughtful kids menu.  My wife had a salad with something crunchy in it. I had a few bites and it was pretty fresh tasting which surprised me. I got a shrimp scampi fettuccine dish that was only 550 calories according to the menu.  Sports bars don't put the calorie count on the menu. Garlic accounted for at least 200 of those calories. It wasn't horrible but I'm Italian and so...it just wasn't good. It was a notch below Olive Garden and there wasn't much of it. At least the OG has the decency to give you volume if not quality.  Lucky for me we also had a pizza coming. But it was some kind of Thai chicken blah blah. So it wasn't actually pizza but it wasn't that bad. My son had a personal cheese pizza which looked and tasted ok. Better than a ball game pizza but not by much.  If you've read this far, you might be wondering how I got to three stars.  The answer is the menu, the service, the convenience, and wines by the glass. The menu is extensive without being unwieldy. So if you're in the mood for salad or some fancy pants pizza, grab your purse and head to the mall. You can return some things at Nordstrom while you're there.   And the kids menu had a lot of options for picky eaters. I've seen a lot of kids menus and this is top notch.

The service was quite annoying to both of us. No one greeted us for a while, I suppose our server was very busy or M.I.A so another server came to take our drink orders and ended up keeping our table. Here is where the issue began... she upsold us on some sangrias by saying it was 'Sangria Sunday'. Sounds good. We both got the white sangria per her rec and it was by far the best part of the meal. We thought about getting seconds since it was 'Sangria Sunday' and all. So when I asked what the special was on them, our server literally said ""OH there's no special I just think Sangria Sunday sounds cool""  LOL. Well no more alcohol on our bill then, sorry. I NEVER ever complain in restaurants, but I felt the need to say something when the manager ran our food over. I mean we were tricked! I won't complain about slow or even poor service but deceit is a new one, and very strange. The manager's response was just laughter and telling us they were having a Sangria competition. Okay? Why do I care? He also said they were $3.50 each. When we got our check they were $8 each..as I would have expected. So weird. Anyway, their menus at the current moment are totally out of date..no one let us know. Literally the first 4 things that we tried to order were no longer on the menu. The food we finally got (focaccia bread app and the original bbq chicken pizza..figured they were still making that) was really just OK. Certainly not worth going back!

Still, It's a slightly sophisticated take on ""Kids, let's order a pizza tonight!""  The pizza toppings (btw, all the pizzas are thin crust here. Put away that pizzeria mindset!) are so creative that it would pique the curiosity of most taste palettes, especially the children! My personal favorite?

Being a creature of habit, I can't speak too much to the other menu items.  The last two friends that I have gone with have gotten the Grilled Chicken Foccacia sandwich, and the Garlic Chicken Pizza.  Both loved their entrees!  One night we also received two complimentary samples of their wine of the day.  Delish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=100

Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3266,2340,17975,3.0,11/27/2007,"I've been to California Pizza Kitchen (a nationwide pizza franchise) several times for lunch and dinner. If I'm with a large group (done this twice), we secure porch seats in a semi-private room, good for mall-people-watching. The decor is full of bright pastels, and selective, well-lit spot lighting. The menu has American, Italian and Asian-inspired choices. Prices aren't exorbitant. Tried various dishes: - Thai linguini (with chicken) texture was like pad thai but super peanutty. - Jambalaya pasta was good, with large tomatoes and a tangy bite. - Singaporean rolls as an appetizer special resembled Vietnamese bite-sized summer rolls and came with with a bean sauce. Definitely good if they're available - A bizarre salad (unsure of its name) that tasted like spiked, sweet sauerkraut. Yuck - Garlic cheese focaccia bread, comes in a hefty serving, and isn't bad. - Peking Duck pizza - covered in a sweet *hoisin* bean sauce, the duck was dry and scary-looking - Jamaican Jerk pizza - blahhhhhh, tasteless and annoying (!) - Chipotle Chicken pizza - pretty good Service (Donny, and others) was efficient, friendly and apologized quickly when a wrong dish was delivered. Can't recommend CPK for its novelty pizzas (like the Peking Duck), but their pasta dishes arent bad.

Ruth Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",30,134,,3.0,9/18/2009,"My friend and I met for lunch here on a random Friday afternoon (about 1pm). Boy, was it crowded! However, we were able to be seated after waiting about 10 minutes. Our server was very friendly and nice.  My friend ordered the Chipotle Chicken pizza. She very generously offered me a slice. It was a bit spicy for me (but please keep in mind, I'm a complete spice wuss). However, the flavors were very well balanced and fresh. I would have perhaps liked to have a bit more of the lime cream sauce, but the corn and black bean salsa added the perfect texture. Unfortunately, I won't be able to order this one again on my own because of the spices.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Focaccia Sandwich, which came with a side of Adobe Chicken Chowder. The Chicken Chowder was probably the best thing I had that day. It was a tiny bit spicy, but so creamy and well flavored. The corn added great texture to the soup, as you can tell, I love corn. The crispy corn tortilla strips also added wonderful texture.  The sandwich was very fresh, but the chicken breast was not seasoned enough. The Focaccia bread, however (I got the garlic cheese), was very delicious. I would say the prices here was a little high, although the sandwich with the side of soup was a pretty good deal.  Generally speaking the prices were a tad high, although it is located in a poshy locations, so.... :)  One more little tip, we saw people at other tables have french bread and butter, and asked our waitress halfway through the meal if the bread came with lunch. Apparently, one has to ask for it to get it. I would strongly suggest getting some, it was fresh, soft and delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=100

The Bartender/Server is always attentive and makes small talk whenever they are around cutting lemons or doing whatever side work they need.

Michael R.,"Fort Washington, PA",0,9,,2.0,2/22/2014,"I placed an online order last night for pickup.  I ordered two California club sandwiches and a Caramelized peach salad (with shrimp) to go.  The sandwiches came with a side (cup of soup or side salad).  I got the cup of pea and barley soup and my mom ordered the side salad...mothers know best.  The cashier was super nice and generous with his offerings of complimentary bread.   Fast forward to home where we're about to eat.  One of the two California club sandwiches looks great, while my California club sandwich had about 1/3 of the contents that it should have.  It was as though they used almost all the ingredients for the other sandwich and swept up the scraps to make mine.  Ordering two of the same sandwich at least provided me the confidence in knowing that they can make a beautiful sandwich, they just cannot make two in a row.  The side salad was plentiful enough, but the ""cup"" of soup provided wasn't even enough liquid to submerge the ""bowl"" of the spoon (that means the rounded part...I googled it).  I wanted to dunk my complimentary bread in the soup, but it would have soaked up the entire contents, so the complimentary bread was nothing more than a pointless gesture to raise this review by one star...well played CPK.  The peach salad had no complaints.  So, if you are happy with two thirds of your order being really good, get takeout at CPK.  Unfortunately, my third was the crappy third and I can't help but feel that there is no way they would have such a poorly constructed sandwich or minuscule amount of soup had I ordered in the restaurant.  I was disappointed and since I was at home when I discovered it, there is no sending it back to the kitchen for correction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80

Juli K.,"Manchester, PA",93,138,74,3.0,5/20/2009,"Pizza chain, pizza chain, CPK is another yuppie pizza chain.  That's not to say it's not tasty! They're in the KOP mall-- the only mall where I ever feel under dressed-- towards the front on the side with Cheesecake Factory.  We were seated at the corner table, up against the window to the mall and despite being dressed appropriately for mid-May, my boyfriend and I were freezing.   Our waitress had sort of an attitude thing, like asking us if she could help us was beneath her in some way.  Whatever.  She was pretty slow on everything.  For example, we ordered dumplings as an appetizer and it took forever to get them.  She set the plate down and walked away before we could alert her that we had no dining utensils.  So we had to wait until she came over to our little corner again to ask for forks, while our dumplings cooled.  They were still damned tasty.  We planned to share a shrimp scampi pizza.  It was excellent.  I hadn't been in a CPK since college- ten years ago- and I remember being able to share a pizza.  Last night's pizza was on the small side to be shared.   Because the service was so sketchy, we ended our meal there and left.   I liked it and will give CPK another chance to redeem themselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80
Zach Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,257,152,4.0,2/11/2013,I'm a fan of California Pizza Kitchen and the King of Prussia location didn't disappoint. We went in for lunch on Saturday and all we got was salads but everything was fresh and tasted good. Service was quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80
Dave B.,"Langhorne, PA",28,30,,3.0,11/22/2010,"Went for a late lunch yesterday. It was very crowded and we had to wait 20 minutes to get a table. They need  places to sit. We had to stand by the door and wait for them to call our name. After we did get seated, the waitress was very attentive and the food came very quickly.  I wasn't very hungry so I got the Korean BBQ tacos. My GF got the BBQ Salad. Our friends got the focaccia sandwiches.  My taco's were tasty but very small. Hardly worth tasting. Yeah.....I know they were appetizers but I was still disappointed in the size. I ended up eating half my GF's salad. The friends said their sandwiches were good. It was pretty expensive as we blew over $50 with tip for 2 sandwiches; a couple of ice teas; a half salad, and the tacos. I have only gotten the pizza here before and I do love their pizza but I wasn't hungry enough for that much food.  The food is pretty good but way overpriced. I will only get pizza when I come again. They have a gluten-free menu (my GF can't eat gluten) but it has the usual suspects on it. The waitress was not even aware of the gluten free menu. I found it on the website - after the fact. There was no gluten free pizza. I think if you are going to have a gluten free menu - you should have gluten free pizza.....but that's just me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80
