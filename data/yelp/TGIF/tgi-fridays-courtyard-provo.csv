Erin Q.,"Austin, TX",24,181,2,2.0,7/15/2008,"This was the first place that I ate at when I moved to Provo to attend school. I thought it would be fitting for it to be the last place I ate at with friends before I left. While the idea was nice, the food was not. I thought it strange that Friday's was so desolate when we came in. The hostess looked bored and kept singing along to the restaurant soundtrack playing in the background, with an enthusiasm for P!nk's ""I'm Coming Out"". It took our group a while to decide what to eat, given that the menu here is incredibly long. What I didn't really like is that they just repeat a bunch of their items in different sections. For example, I could find a chick dish under the chicken section, the right portions right price section, and some kind of favorites section. We're looking over the entire menu, you don't need to repeat that crap over and over. The food was memorable for me only because it did a number on my stomach a few hours later. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. It said that it was served with pasta, so I was expecting a piece of chicken on top of a bed of pasta. I was wrong. I had a very thin, modest slice of chicken and three pieces of what looked to be tortellini. Are you serious? There was also a tomato and mozzarella salad - too bad I HATE tomatoes and the mozzarella was obviously used quite sparingly. Needless to say, I left the restaurant still hungry. Some of my friends had decent dishes, but no one was crazy about theirs. The french fries were so crispy that it was basically like eating potato chips - the inside was completely gone, only a crispy facade of what a french fry is supposed to be. One friend tried the flat iron steak, which was still mooing. That thing was bleeding as if cutting it with a knife severed a serious artery...nasty. Plus, he said that it had absolutely no flavor. A-1, Heinz 57, Ketchup - nothing could help it. He left unsatisfied as well. To make matters worse, there were flies buzzing around. Fortunately, the really just started to bug us after the food had been taken away. But seriously...flies in a restaurant call for worries that you're going to end up with one of those bad boys in your dinner.  Man, it seems like I've had some difficulties with places to eat lately. Let's hope that San Diego will bring me some luck as I revisit my favorite eats...only now I can yelp it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-courtyard-provo
