I had a Blazin' Blue burger (something like that ;)) which had Bleu Cheese and bacon.  I had them swap out the onion roll for a plain roll and remove the onions from the burger.  I'm amazed by how eager to accommodate all your crazy needs Red Robin is.  I guess that's the beauty of each burger being made-to-order from the ground up. Service was lacking, seemed to have a poor attitude and made us ring ourselves up.  Strange.  However, other than that costing my experience a star this was a great time.

0,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,3.0,2013-09-19,"This place personifies what's wrong in chain dining where you have some good points but also some really annoying bad points that equal out to a very uneven experience. Good:   The menu is highly customizable.   It has enough options that it should be able to satisfy just about anyone.   Our server ""M"" was absolutely a delight in every way possible. Bad: As Tom Petty once said ""The waiting is the hardest part.""  Let me expound:  First off when we got there this past Sunday the place was maybe 1/2 full yet we had to wait about ten minutes for a table. Why?  I don't know as there seemed to be adequate staff and there certainly was enough seating but we had to wait along with two other families for what seemed like no reason. After ordering the wait from the kitchen was close to 45 minutes. Mind you that's with a restaurant that's half full and no one ordered anything that was complex or difficult. As for the Ziosk, that thing is just friggin' stupid.  It's in the way on the table and other than being forced to use it to settle our bill I could care less.  No, I'm not going be tempted to order extra food and I'm also going to be tempted to buy games, music or the other crap on it yet even if you ask it cannot be even temporarily removed from the table. S-T-U-P-I-D With that rant out of the way....the food itself was typical RR quality.  Nothing outstanding but you could certainly do worse like if you went to the Temple of Swill across the street called Applebee's. The next time we're in the area and the siren song of chain dining comes calling, we'll certainly entertain the thought of RR but we'll also make sure to a lot enough time or else we might die of hunger while we wait for the process to unfold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

It was lonely looking vegan burger naked on the buns. I paid $8.79 for it, and my friend paid $7.98 for his tavern double burger (gluten free.) How can my lone vegan patty cost more than TWO meat patties? Maybe the meat eaters should be asking what is in these burgers that  two of them cost less than 1 vegan patty? Fries were good. They were out of Coors on draft. How can a bar run out of one of the beers they have on tap? It was a very confusing meal.  I'm left with lots of questions.

The salad was eh, a bit bland, it was mostly just lettuce. The burger was okay, I'm surprised they don't cook anything lower than medium here cause I usually like medium rare. The guac was eh, it wasn't really stacked well with the burger, it was slabbed on and not the entire burger had guac in each bite.

31,Jennn G.,"Lancaster, PA",2,41,,2.0,2017-03-28,"My husband and I used to go here a lot when we lived close by. We moved across the county but decided on a rainy day to get some comfort food. The food was pretty good. I like that you can get bottomless onion rings now. The downfall came with the milkshake I ordered.... I ordered it when we were asked about drinks so first thing. We got our iced teas but the waitress said she was waiting for my shake still, our appetizer came and went. Still no milk shake. Our burgers came and still nothing. The waitress mentioned when walking past the table that it was backed up with the bartender. I finally got the milkshake when I was finishing my burger. Our waitress avoided us in the interim, didn't ask if we still wanted it, never offered to take it off our bill... I'm sure it wasn't her fault but she did nothing to make it right.

33,John C.,"Lancaster, PA",381,42,10.0,5.0,2017-05-10,"Obviously, this place is all about burgers! They have other great selections, as well. But the burgers are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Our favorite is the Prime Chop House Burger is the cream of the crop! Made from brisket and steak cuts, this burger practically melts in your mouth! You can make your own service experience here also! On each table are electronic kiosks that allow you to push a button to summon your server if you want or need something between their regular visits to your table. Also, these kiosks have games, and the ability to order drinks from the bar, desserts, and appetizers without your server having to come take the order! They offer FREE refills on their steak fries (try them plain and season them with Red Robin's own blend of seasoned salt or, for a real savory treat, order the garlic Parmesan topping! When you're finished with your meal, you can actually pay your bill on the previously mentioned kiosk. In the mood for a great hamburger, try Red Robin next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
27,Melissa G.,"Lancaster, PA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-01,"This is about the Lancaster Rt 30 red robin... Nothing but immature teenagers running that place food takes too long to get cause they are busy yapping and fooling around... The sodas are so watered down. Management needs to get on the ball here and hire people who want to work... My husband and I were in a hurry one night we called in a curbside order to go and we ended up waiting over 45 min he finally went in to see what was going on and none of the servers were busy doing anything but talking to each other he asked about our order and told them we have been waiting for almost an hour and all they said was ""oh well it's been done for awhile"" last time I checked curbside to go delivers it to ur car when it's ready.... Its sad but this will be another place we will stop going in Lancaster",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
23,Stephanie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",286,157,203.0,5.0,2017-08-17,"Red Robin never disappoints.  It is by far my favorite chain restaurant in the world.  It was great fallback for my friends and I when we decided to come to Lancaster on a friggin Sunday when all of the delicious Amish restaurants were closed. This location was clean and our server was prompt and friendly.  As you probably already know, the menu is versatile and there is something for everyone.  I recommend the Crispy Chicken Sandwich minus the tomatoes and onions.   Red Robin YYYUUUMMM",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
26,Anthony S.,"Nassau County, NY",261,504,499.0,3.0,2017-09-02,"For basically a fast food burger joint, Red Robin offers a pretty solid burger.  These days you can get good quality burgers many places, but I was not familiar with the area and figured it would be a safe bet.  Their burgers come with bottomless fries, which sounds like a bonus but the initial portion is small, and depending on how busy it is, the server might not come around quickly as you might like for a refill.  On this visit I tried a mushroom and blue cheese burger and it was quite tasty.  I wouldn't make this my ""go to"" gourmet burger joint, but it really wasn't bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

22,Steve W.,"Lancaster, PA",0,14,,2.0,2017-11-18,"Had a small company outing at this Red Robin, about 50 minutes before closing time a few days ago. There were plenty of employees working, at least 10 from my count. However, many of them were just sitting around waiting to leave as if the place was already closed. We learned pretty fast that the place was basically half-closed. Tried to get milkshakes, but they were already cleaning the machine for the night. We ordered burgers and they were fairly good, but the parmesan fries were completely cold. I didn't think much of it, and my friend said you could get free refills on the fries. When we did order new fries, the waiter said no problem and went off. He came back and said they had shut down the deep fryer. I realized immediately that we had been served cold fries, made well before we even ordered. The waiter offered us a free desert as compensation, which was certainly better than nothing. However, I don't feel there is any excuse for deceptively serving customers cold food. Clearly the restaurant was shutting down well before their closing time. While I can understand it's annoying to have customers come in later at night, don't set a closing time of 11pm if you aren't willing to provide full service until then. There are too many good restaurants with excellent service out there to waste your time at a chain that serves you cold fries and pretends they were just made. Also, it's frustrating to see that many staff members just sitting around joking, while they can't even make a milkshake or fries during restaurant hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
24,Donna J.,"Laurel, MD",118,2,,1.0,2018-01-07,"We arrived and there were four hostesses at the station. One definitely in charge.  As I was talking to her and asking her a question she began to raise her voice and tap a pen on the hostess podium as if she were frustrated.  The. As we were waiting for our table she and a male host began to touch one another. He was rubbing her arm, scratching her back, and playing with her hair. All very inappropriate and unprofessional especially when you are working the very front of the house.  When we were leaving the same two were at the hostess podium hugging on one another. No how was everything or good night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
21,Erin H.,"Lancaster, PA",30,99,217.0,3.0,2018-01-09,"Will you get the best burger of your life at Red Robin? Not likely. But will it be cooked and made to your liking? Yes. The burgers here are consistent, and they certainly have every imaginable topping combination, which is great if you're dining with picky eaters or just those with varying tastes.  There are surprisingly some decent healthier options on the menu, too, if you're still sticking with those New Years resolutions - from bunless or lettuce-wrapped burgers to chicken salads and hearty chili. It's not a slim fast shake, but it won't cost you an extra session with your trainer. And for those that don't care? Nachos, onion ring towers, and bottomless fries. Never ending fries. ALL the fries.   This particular location can have quite the line, especially on the weekends when the Outlet shoppers are out and about, but they turn tables and get folks seated at a decent clip.  The one issue I have with this location is it's restrooms - they're always dirty, smelly, and wet. Wet counters, wet floors, wet walls... and if that's what the ladies room is like, I don't want to think about the men's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
