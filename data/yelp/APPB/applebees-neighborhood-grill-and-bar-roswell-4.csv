Lauren D.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",1,84,12,3.0,12/4/2017,"Showed up for dinner on a Sunday evening right around 6. Place was pretty mellow. We were promptly seated and our server immediately greeted us and asked for our drink orders. He was friendly and we received our food as ordered.  As far as the food: I mean it's Applebee's. We are a step above fast food here.. so all was well. Chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, steak and ribs were all to be expected. Edible but not memorable.  I will say, out of the places in Roswell, this was probably tied (with BWW) for best experience. Not sure if that is saying much... but hey. It's food and they were nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Curtis J.,"Miami, FL",0,14,3,3.0,11/12/2017,"Had just gotten to Roswell for my first time into this ""world famous"" town,  thanks to that little UFO thingy a long time ago. Was craving the steak and shrimp. Girlfriend wanted the same thing.  Overall the food was good. The shrimps were tiny though. My issue with this dining experience however was our server. Very argumentative!!   My gf and I both asked for our steaks to be medium rare. Simple request. They arrive....mine was correct, her's  was almost well done. When she told the server she asked for her steak to be medium rare, just like mine, the server proceeded to argue and tell her, ""no you didn't ask me for it that way, I heard you say medium well done""!   What?  Who gives a F what you thought you heard bro!!!  Make us happy!!  Apologize,  own your error, and make it right!!  Standing there arguing with your customer is annoying and a waste of our time and all you other customer's time too!!  Worst server I've dealt with in a long time. And on top of it, our party included five people total, and we asked for two checks. Dude brings one check, and argued that we told him to do that as well!!  Good food. Crappy server!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Julia R.,"Lumberton, NC",56,12,3,1.0,11/5/2017,"While passing through NM we stopped here for dinner. My partner's steak was like shoe leather.  We had to ask 2x for silverware, drink sat empty. Charged 4.00 for a ""flavored""tea..My salad had nothing in it that was listed on the menu. No manager even came out.

Jenise C.,"Carlsbad, NM",0,7,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Service today is awful!  Were there at 1:30 pm for quick lunch.  Hostess seated us and disappeared, after 10 minutes we ordered apps from the little iPad and requested a server. 10 minutes later one of 3 servers stopped by to see what we wanted. A drink would be awesome before our appetizers arrived.  They're having a super bad day in Roswell.  We paid on the iPad too when server finally noticed, we were leaving. I hope she enjoys her huge tip. I'm still irritated my hubby tipped for no service. Service here is usually awesome, we'll be back, someday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Seng-Shi D.,"Roswell, NM",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"The service was non-existent.  I was literally waiting 15 minutes just for someone to take my order.  After which I got up and left.  The hostess saw me, but she didn't apologize or try to convince me to stay.  This is more than unprofessional, it is just downright offensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Sherri K.,"Kailua Kona, HI",9,16,3,5.0,3/25/2017,Hostess sat us as soon as we entered. Server Jaz provided excellent service. My hubby ordered a grilled chicken dinner he said it was the best chicken he has eaten. The chicken was perfectly cooked and moist with lots of flavor. I had the ribs that was excellent including the mashed potatoes. We got a tangy BBQ chicken appetizer and that was wonderful. Only dislike we had was that we waited for a bit for our soup and salad but the service was excellent and the food was great. If I could I would give them a 10.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Michael D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",7,25,1,5.0,4/9/2016,"Obviously, we lucked out last night.  The food was excellent - I had the Bourbon Chicken and my wife had the Asian Chicken salad.  service was especially good with Erica.  She went the extra mile to make us happy.  Erica even suggested we get the 2 for $20 which added an appetizer for free! Did notice that the waitress that flew by and dropped the appetizer was not at interested in speaking to us... Excellent quick sit-down meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4

Amanda E.,"Dupo, IL",0,3,,5.0,7/7/2017,"This was probably the nicest Applebee's I've ever been to. The staff was prompt and friendly. It was very clean and the food was delicious!

Allen U.,"Odessa, TX",10,175,580,4.0,2/27/2016,"After a long drive from West Texas to Southeast New Mexico, we decided to stop by Applebee's since its been a year we've visited one and couldn't decide what chain to dine in at. We were quickly seated and our server was very attentive no problems there. The drop off in the star was for my Parmesan Sirloin and Shrimp, the sides were perfect however the steak I ordered well done came out medium rare. Needless to say the manager checked up on us just in time and quickly took my plate to correct the issue. The plate arrived about 10-15 minutes later and steak was well done however the rest of my party just finished their food by that time. Overall, would visit again if I'm craving Applebee's however might just skip out on the sirloin in the future and go with the bourbon street chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4

Matt M.,"Corinth, TX",4,3,,1.0,3/24/2016,They're drink policy is ridiculous. You barely get any alcohol. We came into town for a few nights. Wanted to have a good time and couldn't.

Lora V.,"Las Vegas, NV",170,226,164,4.0,4/18/2013,After a long drive we checked into our hotel and were happy to see this next door to walk to and have a few drinks!    I don't think there are many bars in these towns because it was packed!  We found a spot at the bar and the bartender was really friendly and happy to serve us.  We enjoyed our time and drinks and left happy and ready for bed after a few drinks we headed out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Dorcas F.,"Independence, KS",0,62,,2.0,10/22/2015,They don't bother to offer Roswell Alien Amber Ale. Why should they? It's just Applebee's! We were forced to go there because we couldn't get served at a popular local joint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Reese S.,"Tucson, AZ",58,87,13,1.0,8/9/2013,"This has to be one of the worst Applebee's... The chips were soooooo salty.

Linda K.,"Roswell, NM",0,33,,2.0,7/2/2015,"Our senior exercise group likes to go to lunch after class on the 1st Thursday of the month. The 1st 2 visits were pretty good all the way around, but today was pretty bad. I phoned in the morning so they would have seating for 10-12. They only set up for 8, so 4 people had to sit in a booth behind us. Those 4 were lucky...they got their food, ate, paid and left and our 8 people have not even received their food! We arrived at around 11:45, and finally left at about 1:10. That just isn't acceptable. The food was pretty good, but overshadowed by the slow arrival of the meals. The restaurant was not crowded so I don't understand the delay. Guess we find a new place next month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Mike H.,"Show Low, AZ",3,113,31,3.0,1/13/2015,"In a town where Applebee's is considered fine dining, this place is really pretty good. Good service and slightly above average food. The new sizzling steak is not bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Roger W.,"Dallas, TX",1,8,3,5.0,8/29/2011,"I haven't been in an Applebee's since 1997 and then I was lying in a booth trying not to throwup on the carpet.  But I'm in Roswell without a car and this is the closest alcohol. The bartenderess is pretty, has an understated lip piercing, and is very kind but more mothering than flirtatious.  The best part of this restaurant is the number of people drinking at 4pm on a Monday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Marla T.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,2,,4.0,5/26/2015,"Came to Applebee's for a quick order to-go, as we browsed the menu and asked what the soup of the day was the hostess said it was broccoli cheese. When we went to the bar to place our order, the bartender informed us that he soup of the day was actually baked potato. This was a hassle because we were ordering for my elderly grandmother; the manager overheard my frustration and quickly stepped in. He was very kind and said he would check with the kitchen, he returned within a minute and said they would gladly cook us broccoli and cheese soup. Props to the manager for quickly acting and turning the situation around. We were satisfied customers that will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4
Bill J.,"Roswell, NM",30,16,5,5.0,5/10/2014,Went in here for my wife's birthday. The manager Milby was very helpful and had his staff help us quickly. Once I told him it was her birthday we got the VIP treatment. Food was out so quick I figured they read my mind as I came in the door. Drinks were spot on and it like the bartender could see our table as it never seamed like my glass got half empty. The crew came out and sang for my wife and really made our day. I would tell anybody to visit this Applebee's. Thanks for the great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Philip W.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",3,30,1,3.0,3/31/2014,"I am not a real big fan of places like this.  But with that said this visit was better than usual.  Though, thinking about it - it was a while before I could get the waiter to notice I ran out of beer.  Inattentive waiter - not good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Sandy N.,"Flagstaff, AZ",21,27,4,3.0,6/5/2014,"As far as chain restaurants go, this one isn't remarkable. It wasn't the worst one I had been to, either. Service was a little on the slow side, but friendly. I have some food allergies that sometimes makes it difficult to eat at places like this, but they were able to modify one of their dishes significantly to accommodate me. They didn't even charge me to do so like some other places have done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Rebecca B.,"Santa Fe, NM",8,9,,1.0,10/28/2013,"We went in here on Sunday to catch up with some friends and have a drink.  The service was among the worst I've experienced. The wait staff was exceptionally slow, and we actually had to go up to the ""hostess"" stand to get someone to bring us our bill.  We waited 20 minutes for a margarita and a beer on tap. The margarita looked like a science experiment gone bad. It's hard to screw up a beer on tap, but I'm sure they tried. Hence the 20 minute wait.  The one member of our party who ordered food, the Cajun shrimp, couldn't eat it because it was congealed and salty.  No apology was made for the quality of the food or the long wait time to be served or for having to ask the ""hostess"" for our tab.  I know Applebee's isn't and will never be on par of a 4 star restaurant or even on the same playing field as a favorite local watering hole, but it should at least care about what they serve and the amount of time it takes to get it to your table.  At this point, I wish I could give this experience a negative rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Joel D.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/10/2013,"This Applebee's provided the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant.  What's most impressive is that my group wasn't just neglected, but when we were offered service, it was either so slow that we had to ask for service again or we didn't receive it at all. I went with four friends for two beers and dinner, and it took us 2 hours after being seated to receive our check after the meal.  We ate and drank at a pace that would have easily gotten us in and out of a restaurant with decent service in under an hour, but our service was disgustingly slow and bad.  It took 15 minutes after being seated for our waitress to return for our order, which only happened after we hailed a waitress's attention.  After taking our orders, it was another long wait for our beer and food.  Thankfully, I was with good friends who were happy to pass sarcastic remarks about our service to pass the time.  At that point, I didn't think there was enough of our experience left for the wait staff to screw up, but I was proven wrong. After the long wait, most of our food finally arrived.  My friend's salad arrived WITH his meal, and another friend's food didn't arrive at all.  We again found ourselves waiting for food, but thankfully, our waitress was kind enough to comp my friend's meal.  However, when we it came time for the rest of us to pay, our hotel discount was not included, and the check arrived late like everything else. My friends and I walked out of this restaurant laughing at the service, but it would have been less than funny if we didn't have a couple beers to ease the tension and the extra time to kill.  I highly recommend this Applebee's to remind you of how spoiled you are at other restaurants.  Otherwise, enjoy your meal somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Kevin C.,"Hereford, AZ",87,281,80,1.0,7/14/2011,"Gag.  Haven't been to an Applebees in years, and this debacle quickly reminded me why.  I had riblets, which were horrendous in several ways, including somehow being salty as all hell.  How do you do salty ribs?  I dunno, but these knucklers figured it out, and aced it.  Salad was swimming in dressing, waitress was slow despite the joint not being busy, and missed details. Tthe whole experience was like something out of a bad training video where they show management trainees how NOT to run a restaurant.  Stay very far away.  Rates a solid ZERO stars on the Brak-o-Meter, though Yelp doesn't allow it, so they get their one sympathy star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Wayland W.,"Lenexa, KS",35,15,,1.0,3/22/2013,I don't really expect the best from an Applebee's but this was horrible. We sat at the bar and had to listen to the girl bartender talk about boobs and other personal things that we didn't want to hear. My girlfriends steak was under cooked and they never said sorry or anything. I was done with my meal by the time her steak returned. Still no sorry from anyone. The guy and girl bartending team seemed like they just thought that bartending was cool but had no idea how to take care of customers. It was like they were trying to show off for the guests.

Crystal G.,"Roswell, NM",1,5,5,4.0,12/23/2011,"Was first one in at 11 AM on Monday. Customers quickly started to arrive. Quick response time on service. Ordered three fingered whiskey and Dr pep. Was watered down.  Got triple sampler onion rings cheese and potato twists.  Cheese sticks warm not hot and could use another 45 to fully cook. Onion rings are think cut as advertised but the batter, although very crispy, should probably have had a dry rub put on to stick to the rings. So prepare for a mess on your plate. Potato twists were well seasoned and crunchy. I personally think they are OK but if you want a trumped up lays potato chip they are the way to go.  Main course I got a 7oz steak with loads mash and mixed veggies. Steak was overcooked ( ordered it medium and it was well). The carrots were undercooked. Other the broccoli steamed it is overpowered because the steak had zero time Rest all the juice is on the plate. Steak is tough but still juicy.   Dessert was a strawberry cheesecake shooter. Fresh strawberries are used for the syrup although I did find some of the greenery from the tops of the berry in my shooter. Left at noon. By then the restraunt was about a third full. During the hour both managers came to ask me how I was doing and how was the food I did mention that the steak was overdone and they wanted to fix it but i was with it the way it was. Final Thought: If you go try and order your steak under what you want try the shooters, lil heaven in a cup, and steer clear of the potato twists unless you want a trumped up version of a potato chip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20
Happy J.,"Glendale, AZ",17,192,15,2.0,4/3/2011,"Yes, this is an Applebee's and you know what to expect if you've ever been to one. On this particular occassion, I had appetizers and beer.  The food was as I've come to expect, although the mozzerella cheese sticks were cold. That happens and they were still okay. The bartenders must have been new. Neither one of them knew how to mind their surroundings (to quote from ""Batman Begins""). There were several times people were standing at the bar or had just sat down and neither bartender even realized they had new customers.  Most places where I've been (and worked) the bartender will ask if you or suggest that want another beer before your glass is empty. I almost had to wave my arms to get their attention for each refill. I would probably come here again if that was a group idea. Otherwise, there are other places to try (not Farley's).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roswell-4?start=20

My girlfriend is a vegetarian and explicitly ordered no meat in her meal on multiple occasions and she keeps getting her meals with meat. My meals have also been incorrect or cold.
