Alicia G.,"Phoenix, AZ",1019,432,2188,5.0,1/5/2018,"I have had the opportunity to dine here a few times while I am in the area. I am impressed that each time the level of service I receive is superior.  The menu is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. The one thing I can say about this restaurant chain is they are consistent. The food I love to order taste the same whether I am in Las Vegas, Dallas, California or where ever I may be. I have faith my food will be just as good. I tend to dine off the Skinnylicous menu. Many options that taste great but only have less calories. Especially since that warm bread tends to make up for what I cut out. The last time I dined there was a few days ago with my friends daughter. I ordered the Asian Tacos off the Skinnylious menu. My friends daughter ordered the Kids Salmon with Mash Potatoes and Carrots. We were stuffed so no room for all the delicious desserts. The staff from the hostess, greeter, server, and wait staff were super friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale
Andy F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,88,1,1.0,12/13/2017,"They have an extensive menu and the food is good.  The bad service, though, sinks this restaurant.   It's relegated to a carry-out option only. I've been to a number of locations around the country and they're usually good and finally decided to try this one in our back yard during a weekday to celebrate my birthday.  The service was very slow, despite being fairly empty.  The server couldn't care less that it was my birthday.  Didn't bring a cheesecake menu when asked and didn't bring a candle or anything.   We could hear and see other birthday celebrations at other tables.  This server just didn't seem to like us as she chatted up other tables with her life story while ignoring us sing 'Happy Birthday.'  We even asked afterwards about getting anything complimentary or a candle and got a nonsense answer about only with other desserts.  If not for a birthday, we wouldn't be there and certainly wouldn't order dessert.    It was really a let-down. I called the manager later, who was equally uninterested in making anything right.  She said she'd talk to the server about their policy and hoped we'd come in for future birthdays.   Absolutely NOT!  There are so many better options nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale
Lauren D.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",1,84,12,4.0,11/29/2017,"Cheesecake has a pretty extensive menu which is what keeps it in my rotation of go-to chains. There is something for everyone on the menu, so it's great for larger groups. Mexican, Asian, American and Italian inspired dishes cover the pages.  I'm not one to watch my diet but they do have gluten free options and a ""skinnylicious"" menu that are not limited to one or two items. You get selection there too.  I've always had solid service here. When it's busy things may be a tad slower but they deliver and are attentive.  While I've had good salads, burgers and appetizers here, this time I opted for the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Wow! Definitely my new favorite. You get to taste both of these entrees and a pile of mashed potatoes separates them. YUM! The cheesecakes are all pretty amazing. For a chocolate/PB fan, Adam's Peanut Butter Pie is the go to move. I deviated and got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake this visit and while it was good, I'll definitely go back to Adam's next time.

Ritu D.,"Mississauga, Canada",23,107,245,4.0,10/25/2017,"Came for lunch after a long hike on the cholla trail of camelback mountain. We were so parched and our thirst was adequately satiated by their sweet and flavourful lemonades (free refills). Hubby and I shared the antioxidant salad and the half portion was perfect for me for lunch. Hubby and son shared the sliders (4 sliders per order) and the potstickers. That was just enough to satisfy them enough in order to share a piece of white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Everyone was happy with our food and drinks. The restaurant was not crowded as we arrived around 1:30 on a Wednesday. The restaurant and washrooms were clean and the server was friendly and attentive. We can always count on the Cheesecake Factory for a satisfying meal and I like that they offer healthy options. For gf, vegan dessert you can order a bowl of strawberries.

A Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,14,,1.0,12/10/2017,"We've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times since living in Scottsdale and sadly will not be returning. Tonight we decided to eat here for my daughter's birthday and we all left extremely disappointed.  Our waitress started off not wanting to be at work and very short with her words. She then reminded us several times that she has been working all day and very tired.  For drinks, my husband and I ordered coffees only to have my husband's coffee come to the table full of grounds, not a little bit of grounds, but a lot! We asked for a different cup and simply never got one.  When my husband's starter salad came out he ate half of it only to find a very large dark hair in it. He stopped eating it and we told the waitress. The manager then came out and apologized and offered another salad. Which we turned down.  When our daughter's kids meal (spaghetti) came out it had a large black ""thing"" in it, which we noticed right away. So the waitress took the plate away and simply never came back with our daughter's food.  After an hour at the table, our daughters ended up eating my husband's food since the spaghetti plate was never returned.  The waitress apologized for all the troubles and said ""they"" would make it right. We were unsure what that meant so we didn't specifically ask how.  When we got the bill, ""they"" took off our daughter's spaghetti kids meal (but JUST the spaghetti as we still had to pay for her kids drink) and mind-you she never even got her meal back to actually eat. My husband left hungry and thirsty and the whole family upset about the experience.  We honestly are the type of people who would come back as mistakes do happened. But this time we felt no one really cared about all the mistakes. Especially our waitress, who acting like she was just simply ""too tired"".  No more birthday meals here that's for sure. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale

It was 3 of us.  I ordered the tomato basil pasta.  My friend ordered a creamy pasta dish with bacon and peas.  My other friend ordered a black bean dish with shrimp and chicken.  I'll start with describing my dish.  BLAND!  My goodness it was bland!  I could taste every ingredient separately, the noodles, the basil, the tomato sauce and the garlic, but there was no season.  It lacked regular salt and pepper.  My friend's shrimp and black bean curry dish did NOT have any black beans in it what so ever.  The curry sauce also didn't taste like much.  This is one of the 2 dishes my friend frequently orders so he was for sure it didn't taste the same.  My other friend's dish was just as bland.  We're all almost for certain that the reason behind the bland food was the fact that there were near closing time.  This no excuse for sure and was highly disappointing.  Of course I'll try this Cheesecake Factory location again, maybe even take out, just not within an hour of them closing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale

Letha D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,9,1.0,9/22/2017,"The cheesecake recipe has changed. The service was surly and slow. My sever barely spoke to me. I felt sad. The cake is foamy and not creamy anymore. A sad disappointment all around. The music outside was good. It was R&B. It's so nice of the corporate arm to respond to me. I still recall how the server served me under my arm behind me, as if to hide his face. He didn't check on me after that underhanded serve. I still feel sad about that decision to go there and try to have fun.  When the surly waiter discovered that all I wanted was a piece of cheesecake, he became pushy and then, dismissive.  You're known for cheesecake. You even made up your own recipe for cheesecake, if my mouth is a good food sleuth. I used to go to a cafe at the Ritz Carleton on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and just have dessert. Plenty of people go to a place for a dessert course.

Russell Z.,"Fullerton, CA",1156,362,323,4.0,2/2/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory. With an extensive menu, what's there not to love? I went there on a  Monday, 01/30/2017, in the early evening. I started off the evening with a bourbon and honey drink which came out in a martini glass; apart from the style of the glass, I was a fan of the drink itself. For the entree, I had the chicken marsala and mushroom dish served over a bed of farfalle pasta. The flavors were all there, the smoothness of the butter and reduced alcohol with the broth all came together nicely. However, I was not a fan of the chicken texture itself. It seemed too... Soft. Almost as if the chicken wasn't entirely fresh, but not like it was spoiled or anything. Almost like the meat was cured or pounded or something, so it was softer in texture than would naturally occur. Maybe this is something that others enjoy, but I'm sort of not for it. One of the things that has always struck odd in my mind is how extensive the menu is. When a menu is as many pages as it is at Cheesecake Factory, and offers so much in variety, it makes you wonder how fresh the ingredients actually are. Is it all frozen? If so, does it justify the high price point? These are questions that Yelpers should ask themselves when they go places. Fundamentally, are you REALLY getting your money's worth? All in all, I had a good experience here. I may return, but the last time I set foot in a Cheesecake Factory before this was well before 2012. BTW, to the best of my knowledge, Cheesecake Factory does not accept Apple Pay or Android Pay. However, they have their own app called CakePay that you can download from the app store or the Google Play store. With the app you can do mobile payments at any Cheesecake Factory establishments to the best of my knowledge. Business owners, if I am incorrect in this assessment, let me know and I'll make the required adjustments on my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=20
Cory S.,"Phoenix, AZ",688,93,134,4.0,1/5/2017,"Would it sound strange that I really like The Cheesecake Factory even though I really do not like cheesecake?  Well, the restaurant that I've frequented over the last few months has made that an easy decision for me!  In fact, it's another of my favorite happy hour locations in town.  It is only weekdays from 4-6 PM, but I've never had too long of a wait to get a space in the bar.  In fact, the only time I have waited was last night, when I had a group of six wanting to enjoy happy hour.  We got a pager and sat at the bar until the table was ready ten minutes later.   Between a visit a few weeks ago and last night, I have enjoyed the fried mac and cheese, the southern chicken sliders, and a salad for under $6 a full-size plate.  There were also many great drinks specials at the time.   While I've always been fortunate with parking at Kierland, one of the only challenges of The Cheesecake Factory is that they rarely take reservations.  I've lucked out the last two times though in the past, I have had to wait for a while for a table.  As long as you don't show up right between 6-7 PM on weekdays or during meal hours on weekends, you should be fine though.   I've always had fairly good service and delicious meals though unless it's happy hour, some meals may be a bit more on the pricey side.  But again...those fried mac and cheese balls.  Wow!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=20

Usually if I want to eat out I'll go somewhere that's locally/independently owned but I had a gift card that had been sitting around gathering dust so I wanted to use it before I lost or misplaced it. I ordered from the to-go/dessert counter. The cashier was friendly and professional. He was very nice and offered a beverage (Water, iced tea, or soda) for me to sip on while I waited for my meal. He packaged my order very well and I was on my way in about 15 minutes. I had the lunch portion of herb crusted salmon and a carrot cake cheesecake. The lunch portion was huge. The salmon was tender, the asparagus was cooked al dente, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with some lumps of potato and some skin. My meal also came with a foil wrapped portion of bread with several pats of butter- nice! The cheesecake was your typical Cheesecake Factory quality. It was creamy, a good amount of sweetness, with a nice integration of carrot cake and cheesecake. I shudder to think of the amount of cardio I'll have to do to burn the amount of calories I just ate!

Natalia P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",38,83,950,1.0,11/14/2016,"So many choices these days and I feel disappointed for having picked Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner on a Sunday evening! What a mistake :( Requested to be seated in the patio outside since it was a beautiful day so we were taken all the way to the back right by the garbage and take out door!  Waitress gave us a very disappointing/poor service and the only reason I could think of would be that I didn't order a drink. I've noticed waiters attitude changes when you don't order something other than water!  The experience was very disappointing as I didn't feel like I could ask our waitress for anything without getting this spurious smile as if I'm an annoyance! This confuses me as I'm under the impression they work on TIPS!  They had the take out delivery guy pulling up right behind us every 10 minutes and the door opening and closing the entire experience, very annoying. If I ever decide to torture myself again and return to this place, I will be sure to ask for someone who enjoys their time at work and makes it a great experience for guests!

Grrr.  Yet the servers here were all running around, busing tables and dropping off dishes like they were Olympian sprinters. I have never had my/our glasses refilled in such a prompt way before in my life. Incredible! The food (photos) btw is good and I got to finally try Sheldon Cooper's Smokey BBQ Burger. It was great. So too are the cheesecakes.  The best by far is their open fire grilled burgers.  Everything else is just okay.  This isn't our favorite place to dine out.  I've come here a few times by myself just for a burger at lunch. Expensive, but very good and less crazy.  Now I remember many years ago sitting in front of some Kraft employees going home one night on METRA to Northfield, Illinois. They were complaining and laughing on how they couldn't get the cheesecakes that Kraft was thinking of introducing below 1,800 calories per serving. LOL.

Carlos B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",42,20,,1.0,8/20/2016,"I've been to cheesecake numerous times. Mostly out of state. But recently I started to frequent this Scottsdale location. My first time was so so... I believe in second chances do I went ahead and brought my GF and a friend over tonight (7-28-16) at around 10pm.  We walked in and within a minute the host, she was very friendly. We got sat and waited about 10 minutes to get greeted. There were a tons of servers sitting everywhere chit chatting and walking pass us without acknowledging us. I flagged down a server because I had some questions regarding the menu. She was nice but disappeared really fast. Guessing she wasn't our server!!  Our server finally came over and said hi... Honestly she had ZERO energy! Wasn't really attentive, friendly nor recommended any drinks, apps or main courses! She was a order taker and not a waitress!  So we ordered our drinks and then our meals. We ordered the orange chicken, mac n cheese balls and the filet mignon tips which I had maybe 30 times in my lifetime visiting Cheesecake Factory.  Mac was alright, orange chicken was extremely hard to bite into it (overcooked) . That's was my gf meal and she was embarrassed to complain so instead she paid for it and box it up to later throw it in the garbage. I ordered the meat medium and it came out completely raw, literally blood everywhere. The wine sauce was off... Tasted bad... Really bad. Server never came and checked if we were enjoying the meals so I had once again to flag her down. I explained my concern and she offered to take my meal and cook it a bit more. I declined her suggestion and honestly I was a bit offended. After telling her that the sauce tasted bad and the meat wasn't cooked properly, I was expecting a sincere apologies, offered a new meal and not the same one, and lastly the MANAGER never came over to check on us!!! I just felt like you guys didn't care. The server came back after 2 minutes to tell us that indeed the chef wanted to apologize because he forgot one ingredient!?! Really!?! That all I get!? My night is ruined, wasted one hour out of my life and this is the kind of solution you have!?  I worked 12 hours and I was just leaving work and looking forward to eat at my favorite restaurant. Hmm not sure if it still is but I guess I will come back here and there just to buy cheesecake. And ended not eating anything.  I'm extremely upset that after spending one hour at the restaurant I had to go to in n out to get a burger.  But the worst part is that the MANAGER never came over!?!

Yvonne G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",63,406,197,1.0,7/16/2015,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before at this particular location.  Brought visiting granddaughter here today.  Bad move. Ordered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain.  Ordered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.   Ordered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... ""I know you didn't cook this, but.....""   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an ""explanation"" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.   I got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.   So for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.   My husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.   Not good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=60

If they don't change things up soon I see this place getting shut down in the near future. Don't eat here unless you want to get sick. This place should change it's name to the Germs Factory. To top all of that off. The server decided to leave her shift before we were even done eating. How much ruder can you be? Servers always wait until their customers finish.

Bruce T.,"Waukee, IA",0,3,,3.0,7/30/2017,"It was the first day that The Cheesecake Factory was observing National Cheesecake Day and it was packed with people waiting inside and outside.  I was by myself and arrived about 5:30 p.m. I was seated in about 10 minutes. My server promptly brought water and bread while I looked at the menu. I ordered the sausage and ricotta flatbread and decided to look at the cheesecakes in the case at the front. I came back and saw a busser taking my water, bread, jacket, and napkin. I yelled at him that I wasn't through. My server heard me and said that she would take care of it. She did. I spoke to a manager who said they would talk to the staff about when to clear a table. My food was OK, nothing special. The sausage was crisp, more like bacon. I recommend the factory nachos and buffalo blasts over the flatbread pizza if you're aren't not counting calories at this meal. The Hershey chocolate bar cheesecake was good, although their Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake are better. My rating considered how busy they were and didn't subtract because I like other cheesecakes better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=60

We came in Sunday night after the Superbowl and received absolutely terrible service. Three tables were sat after us, and all had drinks, bread, and orders taken before our server took our order. She was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes sitting at the table, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender for help. He said he would find her, but didn't. We ended up flagging down another waitress and as she was taking her order our original waitress came by, and that was the last time. She passed us off to the other girl and never looked back. There was also a girl wearing street clothing delivering bar drinks to tables. If you didn't know any better, it would seem as though a random stranger was grabbing drinks off the bar and taking them away. That is completely unprofessional. I even overheard her deliver one to the wrong table. Also, watched the manager thank her for helping, so I guess he had no problem with working an employee off the clock (without a proper uniform).  We had wanted to get some cheesecake to go, but we so displeased and ready to go by the end of the meal we decided against it. Bummer, because I was really craving a piece of chocolate mousse after a bad day. I love the food at CF, the tomato basil flatbread is my go to - it is the perfect size and is fantastic.

However, today I was extremely disappointed in both the service and my meal. For starters I always order fresh strawberries as an appetizer. The waitress looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about and gave me a look of confusion. Next when the strawberries were served, they were very old looking.  Just looking at them you could see they were mushy and past their prime. I took two bites and pushed the plate to the end of the table. These strawberries should have never been served!!!  I blame the chef for this one and the server saw no problem with them and challenged me when I brought this to her attention.  My salad came next and lacked some very important ingredients such as apples. I blame the chef for this one too.  When the waitress came back to the table and asked how everything was, I informed her that I was not happy with the strawberries, at which time the waitress got very defensive and told me that I didn't order them the correct way and she didn't seem at all concerned.  I also had a take out order I had placed at the beginning of my meal so she could have it ready for when I was done with my meal. When she brought the bill I asked for my to-go-meal and she said she completely forgot! I then, had to sit there for an extra 15 minutes and wait for her to bring me this meal.  I am not one to write bad reviews but I couldn't believe this service and quality of food (strawberries).

The manager came over and explained that it was margarine, but could not verify if their margarine contained dairy or not and also seemed reluctant to find out. He also made a comment about how they would have to remake the whole burger if it was, acting as if it was an inconvenience to him. Ultimately, they told the person they would bring them a PLAIN bun without the margarine on to be safe, but brought out a bun that still had something on it.  The person had to eat their burger with just the bottom bun because they didn't want to go through the  trouble of finding out what mystery substance was on that bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=80

Russell M.,"Cornville, AZ",126,281,46,4.0,8/12/2014,"I've eaten at a few CF locations including the original one in Marina del Rey, CA which was the first time I tried them.  I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from. I've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert. We went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking. I took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great. Finally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me. The CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.  A fun place to go for any event or just for a tasty and satisfying meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=100
George W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",33,66,212,2.0,7/12/2015,"This review is strictly about the dessert and not any of the menu items. I see so many 5 stars and I guess if you would want average desserts that load up the sugar and chocolate sauces to mask the flavor then hey this is the 5 star place for you! Had their Godiva cheesecake and since I wanted something with WOW chocolate decided on the chocolate blackout cake.  Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?   Chocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake! Don't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment. For the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?  And find a real manager, which again might cost a few more dollars but could be worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=100

This is one of my go-to's when I have a group. The menu offers anything and everything (which can also be a pain in the butt for indecisive people), the portions are HUGE and they offer healthy options with their Skinnylicious menu. My go-to is either the cobb salad or the caesar salad.  And then good luck on only choosing one flavor of cheesecake. There is just about any flavor available. My favorites: Reese's Peanut Butter and Godiva Chocolate... mmm... Honorable mentions for Oreo and raspberry white chocolate.

TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,5.0,1/14/2016,"C's birthday dessert. After we had eaten dinner at another location, C wanted to come here for his birthday dessert. We were sat immediately and our server was Victoria T. She was great. Attentive, on point, pleasant and not intrusive. Kudos. So the birthday boy C got the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.95). He loved it. Personally, I didn't think it had enough cream cheese flavor and was too sweet but that's just me. They wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on his plate so he felt special. K had the Lemon Meringue Cheese Cake ($7.95). She loved it. I didn't taste it but she said it had very nice lemony flavor and had really good texture. Grandma C had the Tiramisu Cheese Cake ($7.95). Her only comment was Yum. I had Carrot Cake ($7.95). OK, enough of the laughing. I'm not the biggest fan of commercial Cheesecake because it never has enough cream cheese in it. And since there was going to be 3 Cheesecakes on the table, why add a fourth. Plus, I love good Carrot Cake. For the most part, The Cheesecake Factory does a good job with all their desserts so I never feel like it's going to be a bad decision not to go with a Cheesecake. My Carrot cake was very good. A tad on the dry side but that's probably because once the cake is sliced, one side of the next piece is going to begin to dry out. The cake still has good flavor, was moist enough and there were noticeable pieces of Carrots within the cake. The frosting is also pretty good although for me it's a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor. All in all, very good though. Great service, reasonable pricing, great desserts. 5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=120

Their menu consists of a wide range of soups, salads, pastas, drink specials, seafood, and much more! I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked through the door and seated shortly after.  I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer which was delicious! If you love macaroni and cheese as much I do, this appetizer will not disappoint you. The Fried Macaroni and Cheese is made of 4 macaroni and cheese balls fried on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The macaroni tastes great with the creamy marinara sauce that it is served with and also goes well with the complimentary bread.  Any visit to the Cheesecake Factory demands a slice of any of their specially made cheesecakes for dessert. My favorite has always been their red velvet cheesecake but I decided to try something different an go with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. My tastebuds were not disappointed when it arrived at our table as it had creamy cheesecake, chocolate chips, and warm chewy cookie dough bits baked in the middle.

Their other drinks are in between $3 and $5, so none of the drinks are cheap, which is why I just decide to swallow the cash and spend the $5 on delicious strawberry lemonade.

No offer to make it right - just substandard tasting food at full price.  Because I had eaten about half my meal and so had my daughter, we didn't feel right asking for a refund - but I can tell you that we won't be returning to this location.  To cap off our lunch we waited almost 20 minutes for our server to run our card before we could leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=160

Teehee O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",6,62,7,1.0,2/18/2013,"I came here with my family yesterday (group of 5). It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/ Our waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was. The menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt.  My MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took. By the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed  with the entire experience.

K B.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,67,4,4.0,9/26/2013,"I was taken out to the Cheesecake Factory tonight, & hadn't been in quite some time. The last time was at a different location...Biltmore. That was an awful trip & between that and a sexual harassment lawsuit at the chain around that same time, I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever go back. Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot. Lets get the negative things out of the way first:  The hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed. Now for good things: Of course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great.  Food was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that.  There was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed.  Overall a great trip. I will likely put the Cheesecake Factory back on my list of restaurants to choose from on a regular basis. I recommend it.

Jenn S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,20,8,1.0,3/22/2015,"By far the worst experience I have ever received in a restaurant.  We went to cheesecake factory on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30 for lunch. My friend and her boyfriend arrived before myself and two of my other girlfriends so they were first seated. So after we arrived, they were waiting for 10 minutes for a server. A total of 30 minutes pass by and still no word from a server!!! We just wanted atleast water to start the night off. We alerted a manager by the name of Adam Paige that we haven't been helped for 30 minutes and he showed absolutely no care that we've been waiting. He just said ""ok"". I was a host for two restaurants and I am fully aware how the restaurant business is. Either the host didn't notify the server or the server didn't know the section. Finally our server came to our table saying ""Sorry, I walked past you guys so many times and didn't even know you were my table"". We didn't know how to take that response so we just said it's okay. We finally got our drinks in and then she came back later to take our orders. Some people from my party ordered off the lunch menu, I myself did not. I ordered a Salmon crusted salad. We waiting for 45 minutes for our food to arrive and finally received it. Everyone enjoyed their food and as did I. When we all were full, the server came and asked if we wanted boxes. One of my friends who finished eating before me had her salad boxed by the server but I don't mind boxing my own salad, I thought my server had better things to do than to box my salad. With the salads being huuge, I only touched half of my plate. As I was putting my salad into a box, I KID YOU NOT, TWO FRUIT FLIES WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SALAD. At first I thought, WAIT this cannot be right I must be seeing things. So I closed my togo box and told my friends. As I opened it, I had 4 witnesses seeing flies come out of my salad. so I immediately closed it again. At this point, I was so so disgusted. If two flies were still alive, I cannot imagine how many dead ones I ate. Maybe they were in the lettuce packaging when they made the salad, I do not know. But I sure as hell know what I saw. Me and My friend approached Adam Paige to let him know what was in my salad. I still cannot believe how UNPROFESSIONAL he was. I handed the box of food and said there were fruit flies in my salad. All he said was do you want another one..... ANOTHER ONE!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There was no sincere apology, no I am so sorry, he didn't even offer to comp the salad. The SERVER asked me if he will comp it. I just couldn't believe this experience, and it just manages to get worse and worse!!!! All my friends who ordered off the lunch menu were charged full price. Our food was on one receipt, and the manager kept on entering it incorrectly. Finally after the third try a different manager comes to my table to clarify what happened with the receipt. He knew what happened to my salad because he comped it but didn't even apologize for MY experience, just apologized for changing the receipt so many times. I am still in shock at how horrific the experience was. Just wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=180

The Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.  This place is hit and miss - sometimes everything is amazing and other times well just ok....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=180

Kat R.,"Bellevue, WA",93,113,52,4.0,7/18/2012,"This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts.  All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke.  The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table. One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday.  One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor.  Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me.  This a great place for two people or large groups.

Variety sounds like a good thing at first, but you've heard the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none,"" right? The Cheesecake Factory is worse than a typical chain restaurant, it's a chain restaurant that has no focus or mission. It's a restaurant that, because of the sheer numbers of dishes it serves, can't possibly concentrate on any of them long enough to make them well.

Tay M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",56,19,1,1.0,2/6/2016,"Walked into Cheesecake on a Friday night, 15 minute wait so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, the waiter took maybe 10 minutes to get us water, which wasn't a big deal considering it was relatively busy. Once it came time to order, I ordered what I usually love getting which is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. When it came to our table, I took one bite and noticed that it wasn't quite right. The bun was toasted way too much, to the point where it was like biting into a burnt cracker. Also, there was maybe a pinch of buffalo sauce. Maybe. But I couldn't see it or taste it. So, naturally, I ask the waitress if they could take it back and make it again. She apologized and said she would be happy to have the cooks do that for me. What happens next was down right disgusting. She put my plate on top of someone else's dirty plate with half eaten rice and tomatoes on it, and brought my food back to the kitchen to be made again.. Or so I thought. They ended up just throwing another bun on it and sent my bitten-into sandwich back to me. One thing I learned from working in a restaurant, you never bring someone's food from the table, to the kitchen and back to the table again... You should always  prepare a new dish. After that I received no discount, no coupon, nothing but an apology for the burnt bun. Very grossed out and disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=200

Daniele L.,"Partanna, Italy",9,1,,1.0,8/10/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times before and have never received service so poor. Our server was Laura S. To start out we sat there without being prompted with any drinks for a good 6 minutes. Yes this seems petty but I work in a restaurant too and no customer sits there that long without drinks. She had managed to get to everyone else in her section before even coming back to ask us what drinks we wanted...which after we told her what we wanted she went back to talking for quite some time before we got them. To continue we asked for bread when we gave her our order for food and we didn't get it until after our appetizer arrived because it was in the oven....fine it was in the oven but she couldn't have came over while we were waiting for the bread/appetizer to come and tell us it was being made for us and it would be second? We had waved down another server while we were sitting there waiting and she ""went to go check on the bread"" but seems to me she just went and gossiped to Laura given that when Laura came back she was nothing but rude about where the bread was. Terrible tone of voice and everything. When food was ready she brought one plate out then like 5 minutes later the second plate and another minute or two later the last persons plate....normally you bring it all out at once.. After her rudeness about the bread she continued to have an attitude about God knows what and didn't even make eye contact or anything during any conversation...including ""have a nice day"" she just looked out the window.......great food as always but wow this service was absolutely terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=200

Travis T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/31/2014,"I have to say, this was by far my worst experience in a restaurant. My date and I both ordered the filet (I would think one of the most expensive meals on the menu). The steaks were delicious. The potatoes came ""garnished"" with onion rings. I was eating an onion ring and couldn't chew it. The ""onion"" was the skin of the onion. I had to pull it out of my mouth (in front of my date, on New Years eve)  I let our waiter know and showed him the skin. He just danced around it and barely acknowledged my complaint. He proceeded to take our leftovers and box them up, and brought back our check. I asked him if he could accommodate me at all. He said he would grab his manager KIM. A couple minutes later Kim came to our table and asked me how my steak was. I told her it was delicious and then proceeded to let her know what had happened. She said sorry and that she would let the cooks know, in a super condescending way. She said it was a ""garnish"" and was glad that everything else was ok and told me to have a Happy New Year. I was shocked that she didn't offer me even a desert or to accommodate me in any way. I had to make a little more fuss about it, embarrassing me again in front of my date. She then asked me if I wanted more onions rings. What??? Why would I want more of something that I just had a bad experience with and after I already had my leftovers boxed up. She finally says, I can give you the drinks (which totaled 8.50). Any time I have ever had an incident in a restaurant, I have always been fortunate to have someone actually care about a mistake. I completely understand mistakes happen, BUT, at least own up and take accountability when they do. KIM, the manager, did not want to own up at all.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this particular location at the Kierland Commons, to anyone. Kim and her waiter Alan should be ashamed of themselves for how they handled this situation.

First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful. The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.

My favorite is the Ahi Tartare. The Ahi is fresh and the dish is just perfect. I also tried the Calamari, and was very surprised. The seasoning was awesome, and the portion was great for us to share. A little on the greasy side, but still very good.  All of the entrees were awesome as well, with plenty of leftovers. And the salads are always yummy.  The service was solid as well.

Even though I was not really hungry, I ended up ordering some dinner and then cheesecake. (not much for not being hungry, eh?)

I do not enjoy their novel sized menu so a one sheet menu made finding something sounding tasty easy to find. I typically only order food that I cannot make at home, but tonight I went with the mashed red potatoes, broccoli and chicken cutlet dinner. Not bad and tasted about how I would make it at home, haha. But, let me tell you about the cheesecake I had. The red velvet cheesecake cake. WOW. If you like red velvet cake, and I mean real red velvet cake, not just red dyed cake, you have to eat this. That was by far the most impressive thing I ate here.

This trip, I had an Asian-type salad, which did not have enough dressing for my taste, so I asked our server for extra, which she promptly delivered to our table.  The menu indicated that the salad came with chicken, but I kept stirring my salad around, wondering where all the chicken was.  There were a few VERY THIN strips and that's it.  I don't think I would be exaggerating to say it was less than half a chicken breast. My husband had a chicken pasta dish, which he said was flavorful (and smelled good!) but, once again, there was very little chicken hiding in between the ginormous bowl of pasta pieces.   I really have a personal policy to not complain to the manager about things like that, as I don't want to tick off the kitchen staff by sending food  back.  The exception to my rule, of course, is if there is a hair, critter, etc., in the food - - then I send it back and go home without.   Next time, we'll more than likely just be stopping by for take-home cheesecake...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=260

In this case, the current spice of the month, quarter, perhaps year is ""cumin,"" a spice which does wonders in minute quantities, and is ruinous in large doses.  Unfortunately, the cook at the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory uses a ruinous amount in the Shepard's Pie.  I decided that while I waited for Mike to return to the table I'd eat the mashed potatoes from the the top of the Shepard's Pie....wrong; too salty to eat. If the person who made the mashed potatoes couldn't taste the salt long before it reached that level, there is something seriously wrong with their taste buds; combined with the overwhelming amount of cumin in the Shepard's Pie ( a dish not known for its ""cumin like"" qualities) it leaves you wondering how this person got into a cooking position.

I enjoyed myself during the dinner, and obviously loved the cheesecake afterward. I'll be back, but I'm not sure when. It's a bit out of the way from my neighborhood, and the area has a lot of options. I think Mastro's is next....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=280
Georgia R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",220,708,405,3.0,2/6/2007,"When your menu is 30 pages long (okay, I tend to exaggerate) and filled with Italian, Asian, Mexican, American and so on food choices, you just start to wonder just how good the food's going to be. I think this is exactly the Cheesecake Factory's problem.  With such an extensive menu that offers food from every ethnic group, it's no wonder that they're unable to excel in anything.  I just think they tried too hard to appease everyone instead of focusing one on or two ethnic food groups and ended up with food that is just okay. I wouldn't say that I've had a bad meal here, but I wouldn't say it was good either. The cheesecake on the other hand, is amazing.  They have a huge list, from snickers and reeses to caramel and pumpkin- and they're all equal in their deliciousness.   My advice: Skip dinner and have either apps and dessert or dessert only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=280
B D.,"Hayward, CA",1,16,,1.0,2/10/2011,Ok this is not a review on the actual location since I have never been to that location.  I had decided last week that I wanted to go there because I wanted a particular cheesecake I had before.  I called them up and asked if they still offered it.  The guy on the phone seemed very rushed but said yes.  So I was planning on going today for dinner and called again.  This time I was transferred to the bakery department.  They told me no that they do not offer that cheesecake anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=280
gb g.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,1,,2.0,3/18/2011,"I've eaten here several times in past years and loved the fare, but recently it's taken a turn for the worse. The deserts will always be great, but you should eat your hot meals somewhere else-- maybe at a different Cheesecake Factory. The portions have shrunk (but the price sure hasn't), and sometimes the food isn't quite what's advertised in the menu (missing ingredients). The service is so-so. That leaves the patron wondering where all the money is going, if it's not showing up in the diner's experience. Very mediocre describes this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=280
Ann Marie K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",81,215,17,4.0,6/19/2007,"Any Cheescake on their menu, there is about thirty to choose from, is to die for! I actually can't remember the last time I came here to eat something that wasn't dessert. I find their menu to be to much. The portions on their entrees are huge though if you do eat dinner. I find their food good, but it's not really worth the trip or price. If you want a great cheesecake or any other dessert at a nice place don't hesitate to come here! Their patios are nice and cool at night as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=280
