We ordered pizzas and burgers, and pizookies, which I opted out of. Everyone enjoyed the pizzas, but the rest of us who had hamburgers were a bit dissapointed. The meat was a little too charred for medium-well. It was a bit dry, too.

The food was definitely a little better than your average chain, but nothing to write home about.  I got the Ahi Tuna Salad. The salad was actually pretty good except it came un-tossed, which I guess this is pretty standard for seared tuna salads. Except there was a dollop of wasabi at every corner of the salad . First I tried grabbing the different parts of the salad for each bite but that was kind of obnoxious. Then I tried to toss it so I could eat it like a normal salad, but this caused large chunks of wasabi to be hidden within the salad. Therefore, every few bites I'd get one of the chunks and my nostrils would burn and flare up. Luckily that feeling only lasts a few seconds. Not sure the best way to resolve my issues, but the salad could have been great otherwise. Maybe try mixing the wasabi in with the dressing BJ? All in all the best part of this place was the beer and the atmosphere. Next time I'll just stick to the bar and finger foods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=300,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9560000000000004,3.4400000000000004

The sides that we requested to go with our food (ranch, honey mustard) did not come and then when asked for again, I only received half of what I requested.

The food was amazing and the drinks were too! We ordered a small BJ's favorite pizza with artichoke and feta instead of olives and mushrooms, a jalapeno burger, and potato skins. The service was nothing short of spectacular. We were in a rush to get home to relieve our babysitter so my husband paid for our meal without looking at the receipt.

The waitress (Amber) was really nice but, towards the end of the night, we kind of felt like she was trying to rush us out of the establishment.  Maybe she was about to exit stage left and wanted her tip.  She did do a good job and passed by the table quite often.

I can't say I really recall the times prior to this last one over the weekend-- it always struck me as just another one of your chain sports bars but with a slightly more put together appeal. Their menu is giant. This could be a bad thing because you get so lost in it, and I much prefer my restaurants to stick to a smaller menu of amazing dishes than a large one of just so-so. So far, though, I've not gotten anything I didn't like. Counting my calories at 1,500 a day for the last few weeks is not my idea of fun, but my jeans are thanking me. Going out to eat is another matter, with delicious tempting entrees that are easily over 1,000 calories alone. BJs, though, has an Enlightened menu, so I decided to give that a try. I ordered the a pint of Lightswitch Light Lager, 135 calories. I love my beer, especially my high, high calorie hoppy beer, so I didn't expect much here. It was light, cold and fresh-- perfect for a Saturday afternoon. I also ordered the Enlightened chicken tacos with black beans for lunch-- 511 calories. It was very good. Three cute little tacos with chicken, cabbage and carrots and a bowl of black beans with a few measly corn chips stuck into it. Doesn't sound too good, does it? But it was very delicious and filling.

Then she brought my beer out, then she brought out my boyfriends iced tea then she vanished. After quite some time, (long enough that boyfriend needed a refil and still didn't get one) she finaly came back to take our order.  I ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps, he ordred a meaty small pizza. After about 25 minutes our food came out. His pizza was cold, I mean like cheese wouldn't even stretch cold.

Gourmet Mac & Cheese: Ohhh emmm geeee!  This was rediculously good!  It was thick, creamy and just had a bold cheesy flavor!  This should be served in a bigger plate!   Crispy Calamari:  Good!  Not the best Ive had but it holds its own.  The pieces were good in size.  The crisp was there.  And what I liked most was that it wasn't too oily.  The lemon aioli is a perfect sauce for it!

319,Melissa C.,"West Chicago, IL",220,148,579.0,2.0,2013-07-25,"We were so excited to come to BJs this year. Coming from Chicago, we don't have a BJs in the area, and I remembered from our past visits to Southern California and Maui how much we loved their bruschetta and pizza. This past visit was super disappointing :( The service was extremely slow and the server kept forgetting things we'd ask for (parmesan cheese, silverware, etc). First we ordered our appetizers and ordered the famous bruschetta among other things for the table. We ordered a large, but the server had put in the mini order for us! When we let him know the mistake, he said to keep the mini order for his mistake and that the large order would be out shortly. It did take quite a while to get the order out, but ended up coming out fine. However, at the end of the meal, we noticed (after we paid of course!) that we were charged for BOTH the mini and the large order of bruschetta!  After our appetizers, we waiting QUITE a while for our meal. Our server kept coming up to our table saying that the food would be out any second, yet I never saw him go back to the kitchen to check it :/ When we received our order, my husband and my cousin's husband shared a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. Again, being from Chicago, I've had a ton different types of pizza. When we recieved the pizza it was lukewarm at best and had a doughy texture....like it wasn't cooked long enough, but than sat under the warming lamps for longer than it should have. Overall, our trip to BJs was anticlimactic at best. In the future, we'd probably order some bruschetta to go and leave it at that....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=300,2.76,3.22,3.22,2.568,3.0360000000000005

The only good thing about that place is one waiter who has helped us on 2 occasions - when we weren't seated in his section - but he saw how we were getting more and more irrate so he assisted.

Our party was approx. 85 people so it was hard to find a restaurant that could accommodate a party that large but BJ's was perfect!! They gave us the entire side room and it was the perfect size. They also let me set up a sweets display table at the party which was also great! I know some places don't let you bring in any outside food which can be a drag, especially for kids parties. I met with the events manager Brian Neal a few months before to go over the menu and guest # etc with him and he was very attentive and very accommodating, he even offered us way more buffet options for our event with no additional cost! It's nice to know that when I bring in a large event to a restaurant they will somewhat ""take care of me"" instead of nickel and diming me for every little thing. My guests were very happy with the food, service and set up of the party, as was my husband and I!! At the end of the party we were provided 3 HUGE PAZOOKIES for my guest wtih no extra charge!!! What a GREAT way to end a party!! My guest were so delighted and happily STUFFED with the great food and dessert!! During the event all the staff was very nice and attentive as well. I was running around the whole time, first setting up the décor and what not then busy mingling with my guest when they arrived. Really having barely anytime to sit down so it was so nice that a couple times the staff came up to me and asked me if I needed a drink or anything, which I thought was very attentive!

376,Ken K.,"Hemet, CA",0,20,,2.0,2013-10-30,"Went to BJ's (the Temecula location) for the first time last weekend. First off, I thought the prices were inflated for the amount of food received! I realize they're a business and have to make a profit, but at least give the patron more value for their money than what I saw was the case. $3 for a lemonade? $10 for very, very small ""chicken wings"" (or what passes for ""chicken wings"")? $11 for their ""mini"" (should be ""super tiny"") pizza?  $15 for their ""small"" pizza? $10 for a smallish calzone? (And why do they refer to the calzone fillings as ""toppings""?) By the way, I almost feel they're guilty of false/misleading advertising because the supposedly ""deep dish"" pizzas we ordered were hardly akin to actual deep-dish style pizza. In my view, BJ's serves ""puffed-up"" cotton candy-like thick crusts to give the impression the pizza is so ""tall"" because (as with authentic deep dish pizza) it's chock-full of cheese, meat and sauce. When you bite into a slice of BJ's faux ""deep dish"" you mainly get a mouthful of airy crust with a skimpy amount of cheese, meat and sauce on top. Very disappointing ... but the photos of this mock ""deep dish"" pizza sure do look mouth watering on the menu! The kicker was when our waiter disappeared while we were waiting for a ""mini"" pizza which was ordered late, after the appetizers and main meal items had been ordered. He never gave any indication that he was leaving. We waited and waited and waited for this ""mini"" pizza to arrive and finally I asked another waiter if he could check on it. He informed me that our waiter was gone because he was doing some kind of transaction (maybe squaring up his tips with the cashier or similar.) It would have been nice if he took care of that sometime when doing so didn't interfere with the diners receiving food they'd ordered.  All in all, those who are easily pleased or who aren't too concerned with getting good value for their money or minimally adequate portions of food may like BJ's but for me, the best I can say is that I rate the BJ's location I dined at as ""fair"" at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=360,2.4,3.03,3.03,2.9200000000000004,2.7779999999999996

Mistake 4 One of our party members could not consume a particular food and had made it abundantly clear at time of order.  When the order came out.... it was exactly opposite of what he ordered.  He made the complaint politely and reordered his pizza.  Mistake 5 After about 20-25mi  the order came out again the exact same way it came out originaly.... WRONG!!!!  At this point we are completely dissatisfied.   The attempt to make things right went almost unnoticed.  Now after being to both the Temecula one and menifee one and after hearing that the Temecula one service was so much better... I'll have to disagree.   This experience has been the worst I have had in ANY RESTAURANT.  I firmly believe that corporate should come down unannounced and investigate both sites for a period of one month to rectify these deficiencies.  Because this was absolutely horrible.  However the food, when we got it was great.  Not 1-2hr wait time great but good none the less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=340,3.2,3.0,3.0,2.468,3.0800000000000005

I asked him to bring me another one, and he brought back the right one. Dad still didn't have his beer. When he bright me a refill he brought me back some red cranberry grapefruit thing? I honestly didn't feel like waiting for another 10 minutes just to have him fix my drink again. Finally brought dad his beer. When the food came out they got all the sides wrong so we had to wait again for those. My boyfriend and I are regulars here but maybe we'll find somewhere else. Pazookie was great.

I notified the hostess it would just be for two. She then began a 2minute discussion with two other employees on where to sit us, claiming certain waiters/waitresses were too busy to have an additional table. They sat us in Robin's section and 5minutes passed before Robin came to greet us. We ordered our food and my sister asked for  a side of ranch with her meal. When our starter salads arrived, the Caesar didn't have enough dressing on it and my sister wanted to request a side. Well, Robin was nowhere to be found for quite a while. Finally my sister was able to flag her down and order that side of dressing. When our main dishes came, there wasn't any ranch delivered, so we had to request some from the girl who delivered our food to us. When we were almost done with our meal, Robin checked back in and asked if we wanted to get a pizookie. I told her we'd have to think about it. After finishing our meals we decided to get the pizookie trio. While waiting for our trio to arrive, Robin hands us the check and tells us to pay whenever we're ready. We had put cash in the check book but kept the book with us because we didn't want the already lacking service to dwindle because she already got paid out. Well, while we are enjoying our dessert, Robin approaches us and notifies us that she's leaving now since her shift is ending and rudely requests we give her the checkbook. Excuse me? I understand it can be a huge pain waiting tables, but I've never ONCE had someone come up and do that. I've had them introduce us to the next person who will be helping us, but never have I had someone rudely request us to handover the book so they can get paid out. So Robin leaves us, the new girl doesn't introduce herself. But as we are finishing up, she asks if she can have the checkbook. I tell her we already paid out. She then asks me if we are had a tip left or not. To get her to leave the situation alone I commented that there wasn't a tip. I then see her walk away and she goes up to Robin and I can see them exchanging words. I completely understand every waiter/waitress wants their tips and it's a huge part of their paycheck. But please don't pressure me into paying you, it makes the situation extremely uncomfortable. I really don't need you or your replacement breathing down my neck for your tip. I work hard for my paycheck and I'm not going to leave you a great tip for below par service paired with an awkward tip hungry departure. Sorry, not sorry.

160,Natalia C.,"Sun City, CA",0,6,1.0,2.0,2015-11-08,Food is great. Always enjoy the clam chowder and salad however I ordered a drink and it is awful!!!! I ordered an old fashioned and it tastes like water. Pretty obvious that it is either watered down or made poorly because it is supposed to be a bolder drink. I'll probably never order another drink here. I've had friends complain about the same thing and I would highly recommend you spending ur money on actual drinks from a place that isn't stingy and doesn't suck ass  But once again food:good  Service: sub-par  Alcoholic drinks: no,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=160,2.6,3.25,3.236,2.6000000000000005,2.9899999999999998

133,Helen B.,"Temecula, CA",20,46,11.0,1.0,2015-11-18,"This review is for the Temecula location, on Ynez Road.  Strike One: The hostess sat my husband and I near a family of four with two small children under five. The screaming and yelling that emanated from their table was enough to distract me from my meal the entire time I was there. Why would we be seated in what is obviously a section for families? I was very unhappy, and would have asked to move but for the rest of our experience making me want to leave the whole place as soon as I possibly could.  Strike Two: Our waitress was just plain strange. She would stand at our table after each interaction, like she was waiting for us to say something when we were clearly done with talking. Now, this can't really be helped, other than by not hiring odd people. But it DID make our dining experience a little uncomfortable.  Strike Three: We ordered the soup and salad combo, with the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl as the soup for each of us. The bread bowls were toasted beyond what is edible. We were JUST at the BJ's in Menifee, where they served a MUCH better version of this meal. The soup inside the bowls was slightly different as well, much thinner in texture with fewer clams. But the real sin was how blackened the bowls were! Normally, my husband would snack on the bowl once the chowder was eaten, and he pushed his plate away as soon as he possibly could.  I have not had any good experiences at this restaurant. I would not recommend it to someone visiting Temecula, because I don't feel that it is in any way a fair representation of the good food one can find in this area.

I drove 7 hours to be with her, and a group of us went to the restaurant that her and her man (who turned 32 yesterday) picked. They really wanted some good stiff drinks and deep dish pizza. So, we waited 25 min., to get a table at BJ's. Didn't mind the wait at all, because it is a popular restaurant, especially for a small town on a Saturday night. Score! We got to sit in the bar! It's the little things when you finally get a night out together without children. We were ready to party it up! 2 birthdays, and I was celebrating scoring a great new job. The waitress instantly greats us, and I was thinking ""wow! What service."" We all asked to start with water, and I was SO excited about my sisters birthday that I blurted out the fact that she needs a recommendation for a great celebratory drink, and my sister included the request for a mixed drink without any vodka. She recommended a few and my sister and her man decided to go with the first two options. I thought they sounded horrible, so I asked for a bottle of Lindemans Framboise, with 2 glasses so I could share it with her. She asked for ID's, and took a while staring at my sisters man. She asked for my sisters ID, and cringed since it expired today. OK, then she looked at her mans ID, and happily exclaimed, ""happy birthday"" before refusing his drink because he didn't have DMV paperwork proving that he renewed it. Instead of feeling bad about ruining his (all of our) celebration, she pressured him to order a non-alcoholic drink. Blushing and pissed off, he shrugged and said, ""ah, maybe a Sprite?"" Of everyone in the group, GUESS who's ID she didn't even care to check?! I guess I look too old to get carded... I went against my feisty instincts to walk out before ordering, so we choked down mediocre chips & queso, pizza, some weird black & tan but with cider on the bottom, and the most enjoyable part of the night was the pre-bottled Framboise, not tipping, and the double Pizookie they threw in because they knew we were pissed.

They weren't that busy, and it seemed we were going to be tended to. First delay was kids menus. Our waiter was getting us drinks and couldn't get anyone to help him. The hostess sat us down with not enough menus (her fault) yet he brought the drinks and then went missing. Finally when he came around we reasked for kids menus. Ordering went fine. Then came a manager trainee named Cody to let a waitress out of the emergency exit. The exit was right next to our table. She said can't I just go out this door? He gave in and let her out just so she could bring a friend thru the door. The problem was the alarm went off and kept ringing, right next to our table. Alarms happen and we are pretty understanding but this was left on while the staff was joking and playing around including Cody. Cody went to get the key and came to lock the door then says ""sorry bout that"". Doesn't even make eye contact and walks away. I was pretty angry by now.

After deciding our whole three course meal i started wondering why we havent even been greated and still to this point havent so much ordered drinks.  After 8 minutes i noticed that a table next to us had the waitress ask them for deserts, leave, bring them boxes, leave, and then bring them a check and drop off drinks at a different table and then once again leave...all while me and my wife sat there paitently to order our drinks. After 12 minutes we decided to leave because i couldnt imagine the wait to get a box or get our check or get a refill or any of that.

Drive the extra few minutes to go to the Bj's in Menifee it's worth the extra time!!  Do not order take out or curbside at this location, they are either sneaky and out to overcharge you, or they cant adequately train their staff in how to perform the rather simple task of taking your order. I ordered a Santa Fe Chicken Salad, and the lady behind the counter at the take out ended up ringing me up and subsequently charging me for the salad (which comes with chicken), and a side chicken breast totaling 17 dollars and change. How in the world this employee couldn't comprehend that the amount she was going to ring in for 1 salad was astronomically too high is beyond me. But if that was all that happened I could look past one horrid employee, and wouldn't have to write this review. But upon receiving my receipt and seeing what the take out counter had done with my order (they could have at least given me extra chicken but the cooks obviously felt like skimping out that day it was the smallest amount of chicken I'd ever seen on that salad.) I called to talk to a manager to inform him of what had happened so she could be properly trained and they wouldn't have this happen again. I was not looking for anything in return, but the call  progressively got worse. Take out counter was very rude, tried to not let me speak to a manager, then the manager tried to tell me I was wrong, then admitted they were in the wrong, never actually apologized, but asked for our address to send a gift card to encourage giving them another try. (didn't offer fixing the charge, or even a discount, or a refund, I ended up paying the full 17 dollars for that salad.) *Best part 4 months later... we're still waiting on that gift card that is never coming..

My wife had a hard time making a selection from the large menu but did end up ordering the Caprese Piadina with fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, in a toasted bread wrap with marinara sauce for dipping. It came with crispy shoestring fries which are her favorite, so it was a hit. I had the Bison Burger which comes with coleslaw, although not the traditional kind. The burger was cooked medium rare the way I ordered it (thank you!) and the slaw was like chopped cabbage with a dressing lightly drizzled on top, not mixed in or soggy the way some coleslaw can be. In fact, it was under dressed, a bit dry and the cabbage looked a bit dry and grey around the edges. Tasted okay but obviously had been prepped hours before.

Since everything other than some salad was not for me, I went without, but totally appreciated his efforts! It's so nice to know special needs can be accommodated.

Birthday Boy got his own little personal Pizzookie while I was daring and ordered the Trio Pizzookie, giving you the options to choose three of their cookie flavors all topped with their vanilla ice cream. My husband decided on the Chocolate Chunk, Cookies n' Creme and Salted Caramel. Everything took about 10 minutes to come out. Birthday boy even got a Candle on top of his Pizzookie. Everything was warm and extremely fresh. Warm and delicious! YUM! My favorite will always be the chocolate chunk which is just a chocolate chip cookie. I always for some reason order the Oreo Cookie and I'm always indifferent about it. They have this Cookie and cream paste that they squirt on the side of the dish... which is an odd texture.

Fries have some type of salty spice on them, that it was impossible for all to finish them. There were 4 slices of pizza left over, so we decided to ask for a box. The waiter addressed the cold food issue to the manager and she was nice enough to come, apologize and give us a discount on the whole check. No complaints from their customer service. Next day however when my son went to open up the pizza box and eat a piece, we were all in shock to see that the slices had SHRUNK to almost HALF the size of the original piece!!!

75,Elizabeth P.,"Wayne, PA",135,6,2.0,2.0,2017-03-29,"Just had an ABSOLUTELY unpleasant experience at this BJ's location. It started off with our server being very inattentive to our table. He looked like he was serving too many tables than he can handle, and was showing attention to what seemed to be like every table but ours. Then, we ordered our favorite sliders with cheese, and we received them with no cheese. We nicely asked for them to be redone with cheese, and we got them back with cold slices of cheese added to the now cold original sliders. Pretty frustrated at this point, we asked to speak to the manager and I explained to her our situation. She kindly returned with the sliders fresh and exactly how we wanted them. The rest of our entree's were also very good. But the manager and our server seemed to be uninterested in the troubles we were experiencing. Our food was delicious, but we spent a 2 hour trip that was expected to be a quick dinner at BJ's, excitingly with a promotional free pizookie. Even after our complaints, we had to flag down our server for the check.  Overall, our food was very delicious and we were very pleased with our meals. But the service was extremely poor from start to finish. Even after bringing our problems to a managers attention, we lacked the experience we usually never fail to get at a BJ's restaurant. The table behind us received excellent costumer service and even gave recognition to the manager about how great their server was. We wished we could experienced the same.

So we called ahead for a party of six and a party of four. No problems there, except when we actually got there. We simply asked ""how long is the wait for a party of ten now?"" They told us two hours. We said ""alright well how long for the reservation for six we called in?"" The hostesses immediately got snarky, ""well six or ten?"" She said in an annoyed tone. ""Six"" replied my father. She told us the wait for six would be 30 to 40 minutes. ""Okay great, so can we seated next to the party of four that we also called in. We don't need to be at the same table but can we be seated at a table next to theirs?"". The hostesses got angry and said no. Well I don't see what the big deal is! How hard is it to have people sit at tables next to each other!? The other hostess then told us she WON'T sit us next to each other. She had a horrible tone in her voice as she refused to sit is next to each other. All she had to do was explain in a calm tone that she couldn't do this, instead she raised her voice and rollers her eyes at us. We were appalled by the rudeness of these two blonde hostesses. The first hostess then turned her face and laughed at us. That's right she laughed at us. Not like a giggle, a full on series of laughs. What a rude rude lady.

17,Ashley H.,"Temecula, CA",10,4,,5.0,2017-11-19,"Love love love coming here. I usually do appetizers and a drink for a quick bite with friends. Their lemon Thyme Chicken is amazing, the Peruvian Quinoa bowls are a great choice as well. Today I tried the Santa Fe chicken salad and I can't even begin to explain how amazing this is. Yes I'm a little dramatic but basically I haven't been disappointed. Oh and the service? Yes, love it. They're always so nice and friendly and so helpful! On my birthday our waiter remembered to bring shots out exactly at midnight even though we forgot. I was impressed since it was a busy night. The couscous mac n cheese is a must!

52,Patty T.,"Temecula, CA",0,13,,3.0,2017-11-21,Rib eye steak ordered medium well was a charred hockey puck. Inedible. Fried fish was ok. Parmesan chicken was good. Mashed potatoes were good. Of course the pizookies are always good. Probably the only reason to go is for desserts. Not worth the wait for a table.

We tried the Ahi Poke appetizer and chicken lettuce wraps for the first time and the family liked them. The cheese deep dish pizza was good as well as the pita shrimp tacos. Service is always great so no complaints there. We didn't stay as long as we wanted to because we had so many holiday errands to run, so we didn't even order desert. But for a fun and quick dinner stop it was actually a delicious experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula,3.04,3.24,3.252,,3.1600000000000006
32,Buster D.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,2017-12-23,"O.K. , after two years of being away from B.J.'s because of poor food quality and being served cold , we came back during the Christmas holiday . Gift cards were given to my wife at work , so we thought we'd try B.J.'s again , hopefully this time things have changed , but NOOOOO !! The food quality has changed  , but for the worse . Not getting into the whole meal my wife and kids had ordered (which by the way was mediocre) , I'll just concentrate on my order . I ordered a bison cheeseburger w/bacon , fries and a drink. Simple right ?? When they sat down our order and I looked down at my plate , I grabbed a fry , which many restaurants are notoriously served cold , of course they were sitting in the pan in the back cold . I asked the server right away to bring me some fresh fries , no problem . I then looked back down at my burger at the bacon, looked like it was just shaved off the pig , RAW !! Not only RAW , but ice cold , like they just took it out of the refrigerator .I picked it up and it was refrigerator cold , they didn't even attempt to heat it up . I grabbed the bacon out of disgust went to find the manager . After some time he came out the back from the kitchen and I relayed my story to him , he gave me some minor pushback , and I told him ""Touch the bacon , it's raw and cold"" , how do you as a restaurant dare serve food like this , long story short he took care of the food bill , because he knew what they served us was disgusting . Trichinosis is a big deal eating out and I know if I ate that food/bacon there was a high probability I would've gotten sick . B.J.'s is a disgusting restaurant for food , unqualified cooks that serve poor quality food . I gave the gift cards to the table next to us , they were grateful . I will never return to this establishment . I'm not sure if all the B.J.'s are this poor quality , but this one needs to have top level management go in and do an overhaul of the complete restaurant .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=20,2.88,3.24,3.236,,3.0960000000000005
10,Sheila J.,"Flagstaff, AZ",162,10,,5.0,2017-12-24,"Melissa M. was our waitress and let me tell you.. she was AMAZING!!! My birthday had past a week ago and she was checking my ID to make sure that I was old enough to drink and as soon as she read the date she was so excited and was checking on us every 15 minutes to make sure that we were satisfied, needed more drinks and everything. When it came time for dessert, I didn't want anyone to sing to me so another lady brought out our dessert and Melissa came running after her with candles, let them and told me to make a wish and blow out the candles. Every time she came by she reminded me of how it's still my birthday no matter the day we celebrate.

6,Annie P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,36,,2.0,2018-01-10,"We didn't have the whole experience as we had our food delivered by a delivery service. We ordered three rather pricey pizzas from BJ's and pretty much got three boxes of cooked pizza dough, very tasty bread it was, but sadly lacking much in the way of toppings. Very little cheese or sauce on any of the three, but interestingly enough quite a bit of tough overcooked chicken on two of the pizzas. I do realize that one delivery order doesn't give much of an overview of what a restaurant offers though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula,3.08,3.24,3.244,,3.1760000000000006
