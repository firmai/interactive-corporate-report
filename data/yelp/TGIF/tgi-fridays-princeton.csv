Sarah L.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",103,6,,2.0,8/25/2015,"Let me start by saying we love TGIFridays and we go often because it is kid-friendly.   We came in at 1:00 on a Monday. It did not seem very busy in the area we sat. There were two waitresses in our section. Immediately, we were helped and asked for our drinks and the. We ordered our appetizers and lunch. A good start. However, it went downhill from there. We waited 50 minutes for our appetizers, impossible to find our waitress at the 35 minute mark...about 40 minutes in, we asked her where they were and she said that they were ""slammed"" and it was unusually busy. The tables around us were empty. Three parties came in about then, at the forty minute mark sat down tables near us. They literally got their orders by the time we had finished our appetizers (15 minutes or less). After finishing our appetizers, we waited another 20 minutes for refills and for our main meals. I had the kids pack up the good because their sister and her friend had gone to Bobby Burgers and were done before we got our appetizers and I didn't want them to wait any longer... They had been waiting 30-40 minutes already. The food was good as always Very disappointing. No one wants to wait over an hour for lunch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Nye C.,"Cranbury, NJ",0,1,,1.0,4/8/2017,"We went to this Friday's for dinner today. The host quoted us ten minute wait, but didn't even take our name down. The wait ended up being 25 minutes, which ultimately wasn't the problem. He kept sitting couples down who were just waking in or came in before us. Our waitress, Emily (462), was inattentive, aloof, and non-responsive. We ordered the new boba drink and our food, but our food came out before the drink. The food took some time to come out and once it came out we did not get any silverware. We asked for the boba drink again and Emily replied ""ok thank you."" We waited another 15 minutes and asked again and she said indignantly, ""ok thank you."" And then finally another 10 minutes and she told us, ""I just asked the kitchen why you they didn't make it and they said they are out of boba."" This was probably the last straw and I don't think we will ever be going to back to this Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Craig S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",88,1,,1.0,12/19/2016,"Waited 20 minutes at the bar to even be acknowledged. 27 minutes after being seated my first beverage finally arrived. I met up with my fiancee on her lunch break and she was forced to take her food to go. The bartender was nice, professional,  as he could be however the kitchen being backed up ruined the entire system. Several people walked in to the restaurant and sat themselves confused as no hostess was present. My food was warm when delivered however became nearly cold halfway through eating my entree. The bartender did apologize and I don't seek to have this post retaliate against the man. Poor service became the topic amongst strangers at the bar as every customer present was dissatisfied. If the kitchen were not backed up and messing up orders the bartender would have more time to perform his job. My only two thoughts remaining are 1. I have no interest in returning to this establishment. 2. The only reason I'm leaving a tip is the bartender did the best damage control he could and it is the holiday season.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
E M.,"Princeton, NJ",0,11,6,2.0,8/24/2015,"I have been a customer of this Friday's for years and visit them about once a month. The food is good and the staff if Friendly.  This 2 star review is not really for this unit. The 2 stars are for their corporate office. This unit now has real competition in the form of the Bahamas  breeze, and the Sessions 52 that have opened next door to them. This I'm sure this did not come as a surprise to the corporate office. I visited this unit last Friday as I walked by their new competition they were both doing a very good volume of business. Bahama grill also has an outdoor screened in area and every table was occupied.  I expected Friday's to also have a good amount of business with at least a waiting time before being seated. To my surprise thee were 5 customers at the bar and 1 idle bartender. We had our choice of tables and were immediately seated. This was great for us but disastrous for a Friday nights revenue. As a customer my advice to the corporate office would be to make an unannounced visit on a Friday night to this unit as and see if you can come up with new ideas to take on the competition. Unless the accounting staff has already decided to roll over and use this unit as a tax loss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Matt P.,"PRINCETON JUNCTION, NJ",297,2,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Tl;dr AVOID : Quite possibly the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Food was decent but service was terrible, our waiter was a middle aged man named Dave who hit on all the girls in our party hard, the food took over 40 minutes per round and Dave barely came around at all, then threatened to charge my friend who wasn't eating anything because he shared a torria chip , terrible experence, won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Jay I.,"New York, NY",229,666,155,3.0,12/4/2013,"3.5 stars Just like any other TGIF, it serves pretty decent food with good drink selection.  Great place for a hangout with buddies.  Not a great place for a date. Servers are very attentive, coming back often to ask about how we were doing the whole time, and never showed any frustration even though we stayed in our table for 2 hrs without ordering any food/drink.  We really appreciated it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Amy B.,"Trenton, NJ",0,4,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Worst Fridays ever.  Very uncomfortable seating. Gloomy, dark atmosphere. Lifeless wait staff. Portions are very small for the price.  Jumbo shrimp that were anything but and wilted brown broccoli.  If I could give 0 stars, I would.  Never again.  No wonder this place is not busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
James B.,"Baltimore, MD",35,101,1,2.0,12/28/2015,"We used frequent this Friday's often when I was younger.  Fast forward several years and now I was back for the holidays and we stopped by after a movie.  The space is relatively modern and clean, though it's pretty dark inside...lots of dark wood and paint and few windows make for a very pub-like atmosphere.  We were seated fairly quickly and our cheerful and witty server took our beer orders. 3 beers took a bit too long to come out...not sure what the bartender was up to as the place was fairly empty at 9pm on a Monday night during a holiday week. But whatever, they came out cold and in tall glasses.  We ordered two half racks of ribs and an appetizer sampler...over 20 minutes later we were wondering where our food was and asked our server. Of course, he realized shortly thereafter that he forgot to fire our order in the computer. Ugh. Well, as a server myself I can't say that some version of this hasn't happened to me while I was on the job, but I at least send the manager over if there are any sort of issues with a table. Not our server!  Though the food came out pretty quickly after that it didn't come out all together, and my food (the apps) of course took longer and THEN he told me they were out of mozzarella sticks! Not like I needed them anyway and I didn't make a big deal about it at the time but jeez...not a lot of communication between the servers and kitchen at this place! After all this not even a small discount on the check, just a few extra rewards points for my dad that made him feel special but really aren't worth anything.  Server was nice enough but he could have handled the situation better, in my opinion.  Food was solidly average.  Slow bar. I'd skip it if I were you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Ophelia S.,"Edison, NJ",22,33,21,3.0,3/21/2014,"New menus and new items on their menus!  They also changed the recipes for a few items like their mozzarella sticks and loaded potato skins. The mozzarella sticks new recipe was fabulous - it has that super soft melts in your mouth type of cheese that is rare in most mozzarella sticks (I've only encountered it a few times in my life - and it's my favorite!). The potato skins were also pretty good with big chunks of bacon bits and cheddar cheese. The BBQ chicken wings were pretty average though.  I ordered the chipotle chicken and shrimp noodle dish for the first time, and I had high hopes for it. It has a creamy fettuccini like sauce with chipotle spiciness to it - however, my dish came out SUPER spicey, tooooooo spicey for me.... Unless you like that sort of thing. I wasn't a fan - I started breaking out a sweat after a couple bites. Sadly, I ended up refusing it completely, but luckily they my waiter asked his boss if I could delete it off the bill because I hated it. It was gross. The sauce was weird and too spicey.  I had to chug my whole iced tea to chase the spice and even then on the drive home my mouth was still burning a bit.  Ryan seemed to really enjoy his ribs and steak meal though. It was pretty expensive and the portions were standard. I tried it and thought the steak was decent, juicy but nothing amazing. Ribs were all right too.  In short: Good appetizers & drinks. Not that great meals. Sort of expensive. Slow but polite service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Mel B.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,6,,1.0,9/10/2016,"This is the worst Friday's I've been to! The service was awful, we walk in and no one is there to sit us for like 10 minutes (the place was dead, many open tables were available) and then when we are finally in the table my husband's food came first and mine much later. The service is very slow, I've never had to wait this long for food and not once the waiter asked how things were or if we enjoyed the food etc... Nothing!

Pea K.,"Trenton, NJ",0,71,145,3.0,12/12/2012,"I'm surprised some of the reviews are so negative for this TGIF at Marketfair Mall.  This is my favorite Fridays and we come here often.  We always sit at the bar and the service is not slow there.  Our meals come out at the same time.  The  food is okay and probably not as good as it was 30 years ago when a friend took me to one for the first time.  Back then I had never experienced a restaurant like a TGIF and I was really impressed.  I never experienced a restaurant where it was supposed to be *fun* and celebrate that it was Friday, the day everyone waits for.  During happy hour the drinks are cheap, the food is cheap, and I've only had one bad experience there. There must have been someone new in the kitchen because everything was coming out raw or undercooked, etc.  They must have fired whoever that was because everything was back to normal the next week.  The drinks are cheap, too, and they make them a decent size.  I compare every drink to how I get it at Fridays and if another restaurant is stingy, I complain to my husband that next week, we're going back to TGIF so I can get a decent sized drink! Bottom-line this TGIF is our go-to restaurant whenever we are undecided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20
Justin S.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",15,15,25,3.0,1/6/2015,"I agree with other people saying it is a typical tgif. It is not a bad place if you want to hang out with friends and get decent food and drinks. But if you are looking for a elegant restaurant, this place doesn't fit that bill. The service was pretty good so I cannot complain about that, although occasionally the wait time for receiving our entrees can be a little annoying. Some of their deals are pretty solid so look for those before you decide to go as you may save a little money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20

Jasmine P.,"Parlin, NJ",3,12,1,1.0,2/27/2016,"This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. We were seated at 9:11pm at 9:20pm after speaking to the hostess someone finally came over to take our drink orders. At 9:35pm we still had not received any of our drinks which consisted of 6 waters, one unsweetened ice tea and two peach drinks which were alcohol free. We spoke with the manager who then stated he would make it right. Our appetizers came out fine. Our meals one was wrong and the other came out when the people were half way done with their meals. The peach drinks were supposed to have one free refill which were never offered even though they had been empty since the appetizer portion of the meal. The desserts came out but one never arrived and we yet again had to flag the hostess to get our waitress who blamed the kitchen.  We then received our check after waiting for another ten minutes. We then again asked for management at this point it was 10:33pm at night. They eventually fixed the bill and the manager was quite sweet but we will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20

Monique W.,"Flowery Branch, GA",97,1,1,1.0,1/31/2016,Absolute works service ever!! Please do not visit this location unless you want to wait 3 hours and still non of your food it right or hot if even actually arrives at your table. We arrived with 12 guest was only given one waiter until after 2 hours we asked to speak to the manager because non of our food was correct. In a party there was one pregnant women and a 7 year old. Her food came out ice cold and my nephews food was not right when the first brought it to the table. He ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich off the kids menu the brought him fried chicken nuts. We sent it back 2 hours later after we asked to speak to again since the server never came back to give us an update. They brought my nephews food out in a to-go container since we could wait any longer we had to find another place to eat. I haven't had terrible service like this ever!! It wasn't like we were ordering something hard. Majority of out tables got burgers.... we had 4 bottle of ketchup on the table and every single bottle was empty. I order a medium jack Daniel's burger and it came out blacker then the shirt I had on and the waiter tried to convince me that was medium. After we asked another table if we could use their ketchup we were able to squeeze out able a teaspoon of ketchup so I asked him he could fill the bottle. He came back back with a bottle but guess what.... I still didn't have a burger!!! I could go on and on of how terrible this service is but I will close with this. I was visiting family from Texas so I don't have to ever visit this place again but I got back to my sister n laws and told her about the service not telling the location of the restaurant. She says on the TGIFridays in the marketfair.... oh yeah they are horrible. So this is obviously not the first this horrible service is a thing at this location. Of I could give negative 5 stars I would!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20

Kimberly G.,"Newtown, PA",740,385,8,1.0,8/25/2013,"Horrible! Our waitress was RUDE! I asked her how our big their soup crock was and she couldn't answer me.  She made up an answer.  When the soup came out it was cold and half cooked. If that wasn't bad enough, she messed up 2 of the 4 orders at our table. She specifically asked me when I ordered if I wanted my dressing on the side. I said yes and my salad came with dressing on it!! Then another member of our table didn't like her food. The waitress argued with her about how it was cooked. After a bit of arguing the waitress took the food back and forever to get the new dish. The waitress in training have us the new dish. She was a better worker with a MUCH more pleasant attitude.

Sheila G.,"Las Vegas, NV",490,690,1221,3.0,2/26/2011,"It was a bad night at Friday's, but not because of Friday's. We didn't plan to go there, so I didn't print the coupon I'd been emailed.  But then I remembered I could access it on my phone.  No problem, said the very accommodating waitress.   So my daughter and I ordered Long Island Iced Teas and two entrees, plus a kid's meal for the little guy.  The little guy, who'd been somewhat catatonic during the previous gig at Trader Joe's, wasn't any more alert at Friday's, and ignored his crayons and coloring placemat.  The second the food was placed on the table, he suddenly tossed his cookies!  So much for a nice, relaxing dinner. I can't praise the waitress enough for her quick and efficient action, bringing tons of napkins and a big plastic bag for cleaning up the mess, packing up our stuff to go, and getting us the check quickly. The real kick in the pants was when she regretfully told me that the phone coupon was no good:  it was valid only if we'd ordered appetizers along with our entrees.  I guess two stiff drinks and a kid's meal wasn't enough.  Not her fault - the computer wouldn't accept the code. By the time we got home, the food was cold, and my pasta and chicken bruschetta dish, which probably would have been good if eaten when served, didn't benefit from the microwave, which turned the pasta to mush. And the child?  As soon as we got home he started turning cartwheels, with no evidence whatsoever of the dinner crisis.  That's kids for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton?start=20

We put the order in ... then wait, and wait ... and wait some more ... and still wait some more ... super super slow!

Jon O.,"Lakeville, CT",0,2,,1.0,1/14/2018,"This place is just waiting to die.  After being there twice in the last two years, we got a gift card for Christmas, and decided we needed to go back.  When we got there (Sunday evening), the place was about 80% empty, and they told us it would be a 15 minute wait.  So we waited, and they eventually seated us at one of the many empty tables. The pretzel appetizers, which we finally received after sitting there for about 30 minutes, were by far the highlight of the evening. Over an hour after being seated (with the restaurant still mostly empty), we were finally getting our food.  I am not picky at all, but could not even eat the gross, gristly chicken sandwich.  I didn't dare send it back though - I just wanted to get out of there.   We had to wait forever for every step of the process.  Including getting the waitress to take our payment.  Sadly, it was almost the exact same experience as the last time I was there (about a year ago).  No one at this place cares.  It is sad and depressing.  They should just shut it down. I will not go back even if I get another gift card - it is just a waste of a good evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton

Amalia Y.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",1155,303,1257,1.0,1/11/2017,"no, no, no, NOPE. just don't do this to yourself. look, my expectations for most chain resto's, especially in the TGIFridays/Applebees/Chilis genre are pretty low. i know what i'm getting myself into for the most part, and sometimes i go anyway (especially given that this stretch of Rt.1 is a chain resto wonderland). so this 1-star is not for the fact that it's a chain resto, but more for this location specifically.  ever since my high school days, my friends and i would come to marketfair to catch a movie, browse barnes n' noble, touch all of the things in brookstone, and grab dinner at fridays. before the remodel of the marketfair mall and the addition of seasons 52, bobby's burger palace, etc, friday's was the best and most convenient option and was constantly busy.  flash forward to my most recent (and final) visit this past sunday - totally different experience. synopsis below: - sunday evening after seeing a movie with friends - decided to be nostalgic and get down on some jack daniel's chicken strips and whatnot so opted to revisit TGIFridays. (plus, i dont think i'd go to Seasons52 in sweatpants, and everything else required going outside in the cold. anndddd also, jack daniel's chicken strips and the jd chicken sammich are total guilty pleasures of mine). - walked into the resto, waited awkwardly by the empty hostess stand. - about 4 or 5 people were seated in the bar area, and there was 1 family seated at a table in the dining room - hostess appeared, muttered a lifeless greeting, and sat us right next to the other table of diners - it was dark, desolate, and cold. the table next to us were eating in winter coats. - no waitress came by to take a drink order or greet us.  - over 20 minutes later, we walked out seriously, a pathetic experience- such a waste of time. in a super busy joint, this might have been forgivable... but in a resto with 2 tables of diners, totally unacceptable. no way was i about to put out $$ for the crappy food that likely would've made it outta the kitchen 2 hours later.  oh, and shoutout to the hostess that kept looking over at us, with our menus shut, and didnt make a single move to get a waitress or apologize for the wait. or to apologize when we told her we were leaving. nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton

Brandon Z.,"New York, NY",0,12,14,4.0,7/14/2017,I read several reviews before going here but it was the only place opened late and that would take a family of 8. Personally I have never been a fan of TGIF because I have been to multiple locations and never found a dish worth eating from here. Every time I went to a TGIF I would try a different dish because I never found one that impressed me to say I would have that again. I tired the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta for the first time and I can say I was impressed. I have found a dish I would get if I ever went to this establishment again. The dish was so good I asked to see the chef so my party could thank him. My server was Patience who was very friendly and welcoming. I didn't have any complains besides that I had to keep asking for our drinks to be refilled. I do agree with other reviewers though it is very dark in the eating area.

Oliver M.,"Princeton, NJ",132,19,4,3.0,6/21/2017,"Remember, when you're coming here, it's a TGI Friday's. That means keep your expectations pretty low. If I'm going to come here, I'd make sure I'm with some good friends to keep me entertained, because I'm sure not going to have a good time if I have to focus on the restaurant itself.  That said, the service here is pretty poor. If the waiter takes 20 minutes to bring out each subsequent iteration of my endless apps and ducks out one millisecond after tossing it on the table so I can't get my next order in, how am I supposed to take advantage of these deals????  Food was mediocre-- certainly edible but really not anything that makes you feel too good as you put it in your mouth. Food was salty and drinks sweet (though I do have a sweet spot for Friday's strawberry lemonade). Again, everything was extremely slow. Ambiance wasn't very good, with loud music, sticky surfaces, and everything was dark, like most other restaurants of this genre. I don't get it. Please make your restaurants brighter so I don't feel like I'm drowning in middle class mediocrity, poor decor, and stale beer smell from the bar across the restaurant.  Anyway, solid 3 stars. I'll probably be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton
Marlyn V.,"Morrisville, PA",935,681,873,2.0,1/22/2015,"Let me start by saying that writing a 2 star review for a chain restaurant may seem like a cop out...but I actually really love Fridays in Hamilton Square (like 5 star love) and so I was compelled to tell you how much I hate this one.  Why all the hate? Well, I came here on a FRIDAY...let me repeat on a FRIDAY...during happy hour at 5 PM....and it turns out the ONLY day of the week they do NOT have a happy hour at TGI FRIDAYS is.....you guessed it, on a Friday. This fact alone should give them a 1 star review, considering they have one thing to do, their one job is to make people happy it's Friday! I was between a 1 and 2, I gave it a 2 because I did have the bartender give decent suggestions and service despite also attending to the bar. She suggested we have the $10 rib meal they were featuring which had decent flavor, it was a good portion of small ribs for $10, but definitely not a traditional half rack in any type of rib place. The ambiance of this place is very dark and gloomy, which is also not very festive for a Fridays. Overall, I will not be returning to this location, I will stick to my Hamilton Square one that makes you want to lay back and watch a game and stay there eating wings for hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-princeton

The food tasted alright, but the portions were small and the dishes were expensive. They also messed up half our orders. The manager tried to make things better by giving us appetizer coupons for the next time we come back, but there's no chance I'm going back so it doesn't even matter. For whatever reason, they didn't want to use water pitchers either. When we would be running low in water, the waiter would take our glass and refill it in the back one at a time, super inefficient.

While their waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and welcoming, the wait time drives me insane every time and I've been coming here for 7 years. Nothing is overpriced and nothing is spectacular--except the Classic Wedge Salad. I find that in the past decade the quality of TGIF has really gone down hill.

That said, this review is mostly for the bar. Somehow, the bar at Friday's inside Princeton Market Fair is much more hoppin' and fun on a weeknight than Triumph or the Ivy... who would have known? Super cheap happy hour from 10 to close can't be beat (seriously, strong $4 mixed drinks!?) and the bartenders (specifically the two girls that seem to be there all the time) are attentive, nice, and remember your drink orders from visit to visit.

Sam A.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,9,,1.0,2/17/2014,"Well, we never got to the meal because the gift card the bartender sold to me less than a week ago was never activated (has to be activated by seller at point of sale). When I went in to dine with my daughter (the card was a gift for her), we first asked to have the balance on the card checked because we'd just realized on the way to the restaurant that the card we had said $50 when I'd requested a $20 card (I paid with $20 cash just 5 days ago at the same location). When the waiter checked the balance, the card came up as inactive, so we were flippantly told it was unusable and there was nothing they could do for me...  When I asked to speak to the manager, the manager made no inclination to find out what had happened, contact the bartender who sold me the card or review transactions from the date and time of purchase, instead telling me there was no way to prove my word was true and assuming I was lying! No apologies were made and fault was clearly assumed to be mine. The manager said he wouldn't contact the bartender because it would be ""their word versus yours (mine)""!  Now why in the world, if I were going to try to cheat the place out of a meal, would I insist the card had less than the face value and tell the manager the day and time that I made the purchase, even suggesting he contact the bartender on staff that day?!?

Each of the entrees came out individually about 10 minutes apart - so much for eatting together as a family. The list goes on and on.

They're always crunch and salty and delicious. A favorite (and it was the featured recipe in this month's Food Network Magazine)! For dinner I got the petite sirloin which came with two sides. My choices were coleslaw and steak fries. The fries were more like wedges but they were good and crispy. The coleslaw was fresh and crunchy, nothing special but I've definitely had worse. The steak was actually pretty decent! I've had many better but for $10, it could have been a LOT worse. It was even cooked correctly! Not too bad for the money and I left full and satisfied.
