Alli R.,"Boiling Springs, PA",0,4,,3.0,10/15/2017,Apple bees is good food it's pretty hard to go wrong but the staff are a little rude and they act stupid but the food is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449,4.0,8/5/2015,I was actually impressed by this Applebee's I've eaten at Applebee's quite a bit in New York and out-of-state. When we arrived it was dinner time the place was packed surprisingly there wasn't a wait. We Gotter see in our waitress was very nice. I ordered a large beer. Our waitress was very tentative.  Food wise every time I go to Applebee's it seems like they change something on their menu. The only issue I have is that they are usually so much on the menu it's very difficult to choose. So I just ordered. I started off with a chicken tortilla soup which was very good. For my main course I ordered   One of their new cheeseburgers. The burger was cook very well and I like how they find it down on the grill nice and thin with a good crust. I really did enjoy my burger and I would definitely order another one the next time I'm at an Applebee's.  Overall this is a good Apple our waitress was very attentive. All of the food was cooked very well. I have no complaints I would definitely come back here if I was coming through this town again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
潞鑫,"皇后區, NY",6,2,,1.0,6/11/2017,That's so terrible experience! The manager is so rude! She said never come back her restaurant! This is Applebee's not your restaurant even if you are a manager! We gave her our ID but she said it's fake! Can I think of this is a racial discrimination?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Adam O.,"Carlisle, PA",54,133,95,5.0,11/23/2015,"My wife and I enjoy this Applebee's location quite often - it's a great location in Carlisle and the atmosphere, all decked out with local pictures and memorabilia is all that makes Applebee's great! The 2 for $20 has been a staple date night for my wife and I since we started dating almost a decade ago.  I enjoy the house sirloin (medium well) with honey pepper sauce, while my wife enjoys the three cheese chicken penne (with diced tomatoes instead of bruschetta).  We get the honey BBQ wings as our appetizer and are never disappointed. The only downside to Applebee's is the cost of non-""2 for $20"" appetizers and entrées.  I love their spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, and sliders!  The price is a bit steep per app, but the sampler trio is well worth it. While we almost never make it to dessert (portions are great), the options are tasty and highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109,3.0,1/14/2015,"Under 400 Calories the Pepper Crusted Sirloin seemed like a great choice for a Mid-afternoon late lunch. The steak wasn't bad a little smaller than I expected but not bad and the grains were done good but the rice Pilaf was a bit firm,almost crunchy.  The Flavor was good. Our Waitress did an excellent job and checked back on needs often. My Wife had a Fried Chicken Tenders over a salad portion was more than ample but more lettuce than needed I personally think a few extra cherry tomas some onions and radishes or carrot shaving would make a better salad but it's what you get for your money! Overall not a bad experience but not the best but good for a relaxing late lunch which is what we went in for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Sarah G.,"Carlisle, PA",0,68,14,2.0,8/10/2015,"Sigh. Another bad experience here. Decided to eat here since it was close to Walmart and Staples (which I was going to shop at after eating). Big mistake. Been waiting on the waitress to bring me condiments for my food for 20 minutes now. Wanted honey. Waitress has been back there chatting with coworkers for most of this time after I requested some. Granted, she apologized many time, but my goodness. This establishment disappoints me almost every time I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Michelle H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",16,23,4,1.0,6/30/2016,"It took 45 minutes to get our dinner. When we did get it, my husband's steak was severely over cooked. Our server's shift ended in the middle of waiting. The new waiter was pleasant, but nothing special. Him and the manager acted like it was our fault that the food was prepared poorly. They took some money off the bill. However, no real apology and having to eat my meal while my husband waited 20 minutes to have to scarf his meal down seems a little less than acceptable as recompense for a disastrous experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Frank R.,"Carlisle, PA",90,2,6,3.0,6/29/2015,Pretty much a regular there... food is good and the people that work therr are even better!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Angela H.,"Idabel, OK",19,1,,1.0,9/24/2015,"Ordered our food and a couple of drinks. Food was over seasoned to the point of being gritty. When we ordered our second round of drinks the waitress returned and asked if we would like our check, I replied that I would like the drink I ordered. Each time she came around she asked if we're wanted or check not if we would like anything else. Our dishes and glasses were left to pile up on the table. We did order a third round of drinks but we're told we were not allowed to be served. I am not sure if this is just the area but I've never been cut off at two drinks in my life. Won't return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Shannon H.,"Tampa, FL",129,86,416,2.0,1/2/2015,"I used to visit this restaurant once in a while when I lived in PA. I decided to try it again, simply because it is right next to the movie theater that we were at. I have never had a particularly great experience at this Applebees, and this time was no different. It was quite busy for a weeknight, but we did not have much of a wait. However, we had to wait a long time to even get water. Our food also took a very long time, and we ended up staying there for about an hour, because it was so slow. The food is mediocre. My boyfriend's steak was cooked well-done, when he ordered medium-rare. I got the shrimp scampi linguine, and it was very over seasoned. I most likely would not go back, unless it was really the only, or best option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Gina D.,"Carlisle, PA",90,5,,5.0,10/30/2015,"This Applebee's has awesome servers because I've been to others and they just seem like they don't want to be there. I go often so most know me by name. How do you beat 3 appetizers for $12? You get so much variety and then there's room still left over for their superb desserts. Seriously, try the salted caramel pretzel bites. Even the Churro smores are to die for. Awesome food, awesome people. Never a wait more than 10 minutes even on their busiest nights. It's also nice to see the manager walking around and conversing with folks. I honestly can't say I've ever had a bad experience here. Love it!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Megan B.,"Enola, PA",0,1,,3.0,8/3/2013,This restaurant is a good one the service is fair. Really like the corona margaritas!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Herbert W.,"Carlisle, PA",0,33,,4.0,1/7/2013,"Nice neighborhood place with good food and a full bar.  Their Under 550 menu, especially the Zesty Roma Chicken and Shrimp, is very good.  The staff is very friendly.   Select a table if possible; the seating at the booths is very low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
L F.,"Wheaton, IL",1,77,78,2.0,2/24/2010,Don't really like this place but if you have to go you can't go wrong with the oriental chicken wrap or salad.  Other stuff isn't my favorite.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
Alice Z.,"Carlisle, PA",0,21,,3.0,10/3/2010,"While this place is not haute cuisine, it is always a sure bet, sort of, especially if you want basic, reliable, mediocre food. It's fast, convenient and what you would expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carlisle-3
