14,Hazel M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",197,339,397.0,2.0,2012-07-25,"I took a friend here to try the fifteen euro menu and indulge in some ice cream cocktails. It was about 2pm on a Saturday afternoon and the place was practically empty, which might explain why we were waiting ages for everything. The burger was lovely I must say, although the oreo milkshake was maybe only a third as nice as the Eddie Rockets' version. I asked for a Cherry Pepsi (no Coca Cola in the place) and it took ages to arrive, even longer than the food had. When it did, it was delish and cool, until I slurped some of the undiluted syrup near the bottom of the glass. Yargh. The high point, apart from the very decent burger, was the bruschetta starter. It's big enough to be a main in itself, and is made with fluffy ciabatta drenched in oil and garlic with LOADS of tomato. Yum. I won't be back in a hurry though, between the emptiness of the place and the poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
8,Glenn M.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",38,138,57.0,3.0,2013-03-03,"Service was slow but the staff are friendly. The fries were luke warm, but it's reasonably priced and good if you are looking a bit of grease, to cure a hangover",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
10,Melanie W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",36,60,28.0,2.0,2013-03-24,"I have no idea why we came here, actually I do, we wanted cocktails on a Wednesday afternoon.  The staff were lovely, smiles all around, made me feel like I was on holiday in my own city.  We ordered the 15euro special. The starters were adequate, a ceaser salad which was a little wilted  and had far too much dressing and jack daniel's wings which were far to sweet for me but had a decent amount of meat on the bone.  Then the burgers arrived. Oh dear, chewy, under seasoned, over cooked and with a slightly gone off after taste. I wouldn't be surprised if they had been frozen which is a little disappointing for the price. On the plus side the fries were perfectly cooked. I couldn't eat the burger and foolishly didn't complain because our waitress was so lovely. We left as soon as we could vowing never to return to such a tourist trap.  There was an added service so although the price should have been 20Euro each it came to a little more. We had no problem with this and tipped a little more as well but it seemed a little unusual for a slow Wednesday afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
13,Margriet K.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,2,,1.0,2013-04-28,"The food was real terrible. Cold raw fries, cold hamburger. We had to wait one hour after the order was taken. They probably microwaved the food because they had forgotten to serve the food on time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
9,Megan T.,"Chandler, AZ",82,120,29.0,1.0,2013-07-03,"Worst place in Dublin. If I could, I would give it no stars. Took 45 minutes to get someone to order us food. We ordered a pitcher of their ""hard"" lemonade but there was no alcohol in it! I wanted lemonade with alcohol - I should have been wasted afterwards, and I WAS NOT wasted afterwards, I wasn't even buzzed, not even tingly. Food was meh. Ordered Jack Daniel's burger and wings, bruscetta, and nachos. (we were hungry) But it took literally over two hours for us just to get our food and drinks in total. Only 20 minutes for us to eat. And then another 45 minutes for the check.  Honestly, who knew it would take A WHOLE EVENING for dinner? We didn't even want to go out to drinks or dancing after that. It's was time for bed. Frickin A!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
6,Ian V.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,6,11.0,4.0,2014-04-22,"After eating eddy rockets for weeks on end i wanted something els, something bigger, something more american and quite frankly something with jack daniels sauce. I got exactly what i wanted, the style of tgi is fun bright and just puts a smile in my face. I got sit down in a nice booth( i love booths) and ordered the ULTIMATE JACK DANIELS BURGER! Which is ofc a double burger with onions rings jack sauce and some salad to make you lie to yourself that you're at least eating something healthy.  End verdict Tasty Filling Delicious Great atmosphere Wohooo ill be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
7,Jeff R.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",17,4,6.0,1.0,2014-07-03,"Honestly don't know where to start with this place. they really either need to start from scratch or close down. Dropped in last Sunday with my family for a spot of lunch.  Ordered 2 starters, only one arrived which was also incomplete (missing some advertised components). Waited about another 15 mins for the second starter to arrive. For my main I ordered the Jack Daniels salmon and I'm really sorry I didn't take a photo at the time but I was just in such shock at what was put in front of me. A salon ""fillet"" approximately half and inch wide and six inches long, 3 pieces of broccoli, 4 sticks of carrot and a ramekin of mash potato. To add insult to injury, the miniscule portion of salmon was over cooked and all this cost a whopping €22.95!?! Our server was rarely available and when we stopped one of the other floor staff she responded with an incredulous ""WHAT?!?"" when we asked for refills. The table next to us had good brought out to them and the server asked which of them ordered the steak, they responded with none of them had for starters. Their server (same as ours) had forgotten order starters for them completely. All in all, it's a pretty shocking account of what should be a decent restaurant with that name above the door. I've been to TGI's all over the world but this is the pits. No excuse as it wasn't even busy. So if you're looking for somewhere good, look somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
12,Sinead K.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,15,1.0,2.0,2014-07-09,"This place was really disappointing. The venue is far too big. We had to sit in an empty room and people were spread all around the restaurant it would make more sense to have everyone sitting close to create more of an atmosphere. The food was way too overpriced and the food was dry and over cooked. I have ate in TGI fridays many times, but I really found this venue to be extremely bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
4,Wesley W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",86,685,957.0,4.0,2014-08-08,"I like this Fridays.  Well, I like all Fridays but this one especially because not only is it in Temple Bar but it has a very original layout.  It was formerly a hotel bar but has been converted.  It's not as big as some of the other locations but it has everything you expect and the staff are lovely.  Here is something which is also kinda humorous, most Fridays, especially in Ireland, are thought of being a bit expensive on price, not too expensive but a bit more than you normally would pay at other places.  Well, with this place being in Temple Bar it would be one of the cheaper options available, especially when it comes to pints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
3,Kate D.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",336,304,218.0,3.0,2015-03-22,"It's never my choice to go to chain places like this (especially when it's not even fast food, so not even cheap!) when there are so many amazing places to eat in Dublin but I ended up here on a Saturday night because we hadn't planned on eating out. The table wait was about 35 minutes which was fine and there was space at the bar so we got a couple of cocktails. The restaurant was only half full which was strange but I assume there were later reservations for the whole place.  The cocktail list is pretty good, some creative ones on there as well as the classics. I tried the Turkish Delight and the White Chocolate Martini, as well as sipping the Bubblegum Daiquiri. All were fine, but I would only order the Turkish Delight again, and that's probably just because of how super weird it was. They were all about 7 euro, which I guess is fine for Dublin.  The food though is way to expensive for what it's worth in my opinion. The style is very BBQ-grill-fast food style but there aren't many dishes under 15 euro and most are around 17-24.  I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich which was very delicious and came with fries which were nicely cooked but cold.  The service was decent, though like I said the restaurant wasn't that busy, and we were just getting a main and drinks.  I can't give it any higher than three stars because of the prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
5,Davide P.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",8,9,1.0,2.0,2015-04-25,Just an overpriced American bar. Burgers are nothing special. Chips are salty and full of black pepper. Limited selection of beers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
11,Amna H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",2,4,8.0,1.0,2015-11-29,Extremely slow and poor service. This is the 4th time I've been to this location and my food is always cold and comes out after half an hour. Even when the place is dead. Hope they improve soon otherwise we will have to choose another place to go to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
1,Emma G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",72,106,83.0,3.0,2015-12-05,"Popped in here tonight for dinner with the girls. We were seated straight away, although it was right in the corner but I guess we can't complain about that around Christmas time. It was very busy.  I've noticed that since the last time I visited TGI Fridays, the prices have gone up, not only by a small amount, either. Prices that were originally €12.95 are now €14.75, €5 is now €6.95, that's quite a jump.  I've always been a fan of the food and of the big portions (queue me being rolled out of the place) but today that wasn't the case. I ordered Chicken Fingers, they come with fries or a side salad. I love the fries with Jack Daniels sauce so I opted for that. I got 5 chicken fingers and a small (very small!) portion of fries.  That was €14.75. I was shocked! That's almost €15 for something I could throw in the oven myself. Seriously.  I have to commend them on their unlimited refills on soft drinks, that's always a handy thing to have.  Our waitress was great, she was very attentive and smiley.  The music got extremely loud very suddenly and it wasn't turned back down, we found ourselves shouting over it to hear each other.  I guess you could say this wasn't one of the best trips to TGI Fridays I've had.  It may be a while before I come back, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
0,Nicole D.,"Ballsbridge, Republic of Ireland",165,16,93.0,3.0,2016-02-15,Popped in for some food with a friend and was pretty disappointed.  I got chicken tenders to start - you only get 3 which I actually think is outrageous  they were very average too. However my burger was quite nice and very big.  Definitely too over priced for the standard and amount of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
2,Fiona N.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",10,58,65.0,3.0,2016-12-01,"Food was pretty average. I've eaten in TGI Fridays before and enjoyed those experiences more. In this branch I ordered the beef burger with fries. For the price of the meal I expected it to be presented a nicer and served hot! Although it was cooked it was cold!  However, the coffee was good and the service staff were attentive. I make particular reference to one employee named Marcus! He was more than helpful and very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-5,,,,,
