Kona K.,"Huntington Station, NY",11,281,2,4.0,1/4/2018,"I have been coming here since they demolished the Whitman Theatre on this spot ( I saw some of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, the original ""Jaws""  as well as some others over the years-- I'm old).  This is the better / best ? Cheesecake Factory out of all the Long Island locations. (The one by Roosevelt Field is a zoo/circus/ horror show on weekends! Lots of lovely police activity too!) The food here is always consistent . You'll never have a bad meal here. (Well, I didn't.)  You'll never have a bad server here- (well I never have).  But here's the thing (Jerry Seinfeld voice) ................................ I *never* come here during PEAK hours : Friday, Saturday ( 6 to 11 PM) & Sunday (brunch/early dinner time 12:00 noon to 5 PM) .  By choice-- I do not have a family and children. And as sad and lonely as that may be perceived -- by some-- it allows me to ....  GO OUT TO DINNER ANY TIME I WANT (ba ha ha ha ha ha!) .  (Tuesday night @ 9:58 PM-- c'mon let's GO! The entire place is empty and we can sit anywhere want--  like we own the f***ing place! Opulence! )  I avoid crowds here on Long Island like a bloody tampon avoids a shark tank. I actually never experienced that long long Cheescake Factory wait wherein the waiting area is clogged with people in heavy winter coats looking like they wanna kill & eat each other.  Moreover -that God damned ""wait for the buzzer"" thingie has never touched my greasy palm and I have NEVER pressed my snotty nose up against the Cheesecake glass display cases while waiting for a table and looking like a zombie from ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the case is filled with People flavored cheesecake.  The other pitfall of eating out during *PEAK* hours is that the staff  here (or anywhere) is only human- and humans get burnt out.  Food comes out less than perfect, orders take forever to come out, meat gets cooked wrong, orders get cold, orders get forgotten, kitchen runs outta food, server gets irritated, no utencils, no napkins, no drink refills, no space at the bar and then bartender ignores you, restrooms get gross and crowded & toilet paper all over the floor, place gets REALLY noisy , etc.  Oh yeah,  the food:  I ordered the Buffalo Strips and my gosh they were delicious - in fact I am ordering them as my DINNER next time (they were an appetizer-- plenty to share for 2 people. If had this as a dinner --this and a side salad would be perfect! ).   For dinner I had the Fried Shrimp platter and it was gigantic -- could not finish it (and I'm a ""big eater"" guy).  Of Note: Cheesecake Factory's condiments are outta this world ! I know this sounds strange but their tarter sauce and blue cheese (HUGE chunks of cheese within) dressing tasted better than what you'd get at a 5-star steak house in NYC !  Only Bummer:  a small single serve bottle of Ginger Ale was $3.50 as it ""came from the bar"". As you know , bars like to OVER CHARGE for drinks that are ""components"" to their mixers.  Nonsense. Ginger Ale should be on tap--it's a basic soft drink AND mixer.   So there ya go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Kerry M.,"Manorville, NY",9,74,32,2.0,12/27/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the one in Smith Haven Mall a million times and always have a good experience. Even when the place is overflowing with people, staff is friendly and attentive.  Huntington Station location-awful. Our server was friendly but slow as anything. It took us an hour and a half to just have dinner. No appetizers. No dessert.  When the food finally came, my friend's salad was supposed to have chicken and it had none. But we were unable to get anyone's attention to get it rectified. When we finally spoke to another server we were told ""oh I'm watching her table for 15 minutes"" oh ok. Because we haven't seen her in 30 and you did a very bad job watching us. I then asked for a manager who never came over to the table. Wonderful customer service. They gave us a whopping $5 off for the salad. You clearly know we were unhappy for a number of reasons and we get $5. Fantastic. Then I order three slices of cheesecake to go...20 minutes later ....  Huntington Station Cheesecake Factory- you need to step up your game. This is unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Chris R.,"East Meadow, NY",0,4,3,1.0,12/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has Cheesecakes that range from decent to good...but absolutely nothing else. The servers are nice but the management and chefs are challenged to say the least.  I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It seemed intriguing because i didn't think the flavors would ever work together. I'm not the best chef, but my suspicion of the dish was warranted. Never have I smelled a more foul substance. The flavors flat out don't work. The combination of crunchy textures with soft texture do not mix. The sugary sweet cream sauce combined with the spice of chipotle do not mix. The pasta was a little undercooked but it was drenched in sauce. And altogether the dish was a mess. I took a few bites and sent it back. The server asked if I wanted to swap it out for something else but I was so revolted I just wanted to wait for my wife to finish her meal so we could leave. The server then came back and said her manager tasted it and he said it was fine. I disagreed but i thought that was that...then they BILLED me for it. I had a gift card from two years ago that I never used so I didn't argue and paid the bill.  I've never been a fan of this restaurant. The wait is never worth the sub, sub, SUB-par food. And now, since the managers don't give a shit about their restaurants inadequate performance, I'll never go back. Hell, never would've gone there to begin with if it weren't for finding an unused gift card in my junk drawer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington

Kaitlyn K.,"Levittown, NY",217,119,295,4.0,10/3/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory location multiple times, for different meals, and have never been disappointed! Upon walking in, the lighting is warm, the seating is comfortable, and spaced well so you're not on top of the party next to or behind you.  The booths are roomy and comfortable.  I've had the nachos and the buffalo triangles for appetizers and WOW, both are very filling, so if you're just two people I'd advise you pick just one.  For a larger party, you can get both and everyone can enjoy each with a generous serving.  I've had multiple sandwiches and a few items off of the SkinnyLicious menu throughout my visits and loved everything I've ordered.  For dessert (if there is room... or if that's what you came for), I suggest the s'mores cheesecake or the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake (it's devilishly delicious). Bon appetite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Amanda K R.,"Lindenhurst, NY",51,96,446,5.0,10/24/2017,"5 stars because they are sinfully delish and have amazing service.   If you're counting calories, this is not the place for you.  However, feel like I've somewhat circumvented that when I order from the appetizer/small plate part of the GIANT menu- extensive Goat cheese beet salad and the shrimp spring rolls- died and gone to foodie heaven.   Calories replaced with the Lemon Drop Martinis however. So good I've made every attempt to recreate and perfect at home- nailed it!  Never a disappointment except if you come during peak hours and weekends, Be patient and prepared to wait.  So worth it though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Kristy F.,"East Northport, NY",210,38,53,5.0,8/29/2017,"I don't know how they manage to have a menu that's so large, yet everything I ever get is always amazing. The portions are huge, so whatever you get, if you want Dessert, skip the appetizers and save room for the Cheesecake. My boyfriend and I each got a slice for dessert and we didn't even nearly finish them, we were so full. We got the celebration cheesecake that looks like funfetti, and the lemon tarte cake which was also amazing.  There is a good wait too, so be prepared to wait or try and go for lunch or an odd time. They don't take reservations so trying to go here with a large party is very difficult and I do not recommend it. Anymore than 6 people and it becomes very difficult.  Also, if you go for lunch and are getting a pasta or salad, get the lunch portion. It's still massive and cheaper!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Melissa J.,"Cairo, NY",16,81,19,2.0,12/3/2017,"Came in on a Friday night, which I 100% expect to be very crowded, and it was. Even despite the crowd, it wasn't too long of a wait after having a drink at the bar.  I have to say, my server was very nice but I couldn't believe the length of time it took for things to come out. We had nachos as an app the took nearly 30mins to come out, another 30 mins to get to the food. Ok I can still somewhat understand, the kitchen gets backed up, things coming out slower. By the time we had finished eating, much of the restaurant had emptied out. At this point we were ready for cheesecake. This is where I become most frustrated. The slices of cake take not time to get. They don't involve cooking but it still took nearly 30mins for them to make it to the table, and an insane amount of time for us to pay. I love Cheesecake Factory but don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Brenda J.,"Queens, NY",105,57,309,3.0,6/24/2017,"Just like any chain restaurant, it's crowded and noisy. It's mainly families and people celebrating different occasions and I even got to listen to a happy birthday song too.  The food was pretty good for a chain. We got the Mac and cheese balls, crispy Cuban rolls, parmesan chicken pizza and a house salad because I need some type of vegetable with my meals! The Mac and cheese was delicious and I was also amazed that the chicken parmesan pizza was a round flat chicken topped with sauce and pasta. The service was great although they tend to take away plates even though we weren't done yet. I also ordered the classic margarita which was smaller than I imagined. We got two cheesecakes - the Reeses cheesecake and the keylime cheesecake. I couldn't choose since there were dozens of choices! I would say it's not the best but definitely try one of their special concoctions!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington
Mellie M.,"Flushing, NY",4,18,60,3.0,10/22/2017,"This place is ok, a little too noisy for me for a Saturday afternoon. The food was good, the service not so good, the server seemed to have too much going on, she took our order after her introduction and we rarely seen her after that. Another person brought our food and the meatballs were cold, so we returned them to get them reheated. We had to ask for refills of our waters twice by someone else, so by the time my husband's food came back out, I  ate my meal and was done with it. They ended up replacing his meal with a fresh one, which we appreciated, but still ate separately.  I will return to try other meals on the menu and hopefully have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington

From the miso salmon to the original cheesecake it's a delight to dine there EXCEPT for this location in huntington NY! This time I ordered fire cracker salmon. How on earth can you mess that up? Well look below and you will see. Yet it's still a whopping $15. To add insult to injury we didn't get bread, butter, napkins, or utensils. Now get ready for some real comedy!!! When I called back the manger said "" you must ask for utensils""! Wait what? When I sit down in your establishment I don't have to ask for utensils. His response ""you aren't dining in""!

The food as always was great, but the service was less than satisfactory. It took over 10 minutes to have our waters refilled, I ordered a drink from the bar and my drink arrived 15-20 minutes after those for my friends.

The menu is a mini spiral bound book. There is something for everything. And the service is pretty friendly and attentive as well. Also, everything about this place is big. The restaurant is big; the menu is big; portions are big; the slices of cheesecake are BIG. I'm not a huge fan of chains...but if you must, you must.

Came here for the 2,456th time, and mid-meal I realized I haven't blessed this spot with a yelp review so here it is:  Atmosphere: All Cheesecake Factories have the same: titanic-esque appearance, so I won't bother with this part. Service: 95% of the time, I've received great service here, including last night Food: Calamari app never disappoints (the dipping sauces are partly to blame)            Usually meals are spot on. I did order the Kobe burger and instead of MEDIUM it was medium-well bordering well-done. Huge disappointment. But the quality, flavor, and portions are always spot on. Alcohol: past times I've drank here, drinks were strong, mixed well. This time I stuck with Shirley Temple on the rocks (I like to live life on the edge plus I was driving).

The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner.

Ash M.,"Huntington, NY",0,4,4,1.0,11/24/2017,"Came into Cheesecake Factory with my family for a quick bite to eat tonight. First of all, we were just about to take our table before the manager, Rob, let his friends sit in front of us. Alright, a table by the bar was empty so we sat there instead. It took us twenty minutes to get a server to even acknowledge us, and then the server didn't even take our order, some other random man did. We wait just about an hour before my dad asked the waiter to check on our food, which he automatically brings out. This tells us it's been sitting out, so thanks for forgetting about us. Then the food comes and my brother asked for a burger with NO cheese, what comes out? A cheeseburger. Manager offers a single slice of cheesecake for a family of four. Great, but we declined. Manager offered to cover the bill. He then came back and told us he couldn't. That is so fantastic! Other manager, Oscar, came over and said there's nothing he can do and that we're lucky he took the burger off. Yeah so lucky cause my brother is lactose intolerant and wouldn't eat it anyways. Oscar gave us an issue saying we had to pay when my dad initially told Rob that he didn't want the bill covered and wanted to pay. Literally made no sense. Food was mediocre and beyond unsatisfactory. Went home and had thanksgiving leftovers for the fifth time. You will not be seeing us again, Cheesecake Factory. We will NEVER forget the horrible service at this restaurant. If you're looking for Cheesecake, make it yourself or head over to Westbury or Roosevelt field mall for the other establishments. Don't be subjected to horrible service for mediocre food. Don't let anyone fight with you at Cheesecake",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=20

Not a factory, there were Egyptian faces on columns, wall paintings of birds and lighting on booth posts that looked like a dinosaur eye!  The service was prompt and friendly. The menus have the calories next to each dish which was discouraging lol. The drinks were standard restaurant style as my mule was made from a premix. The dinner was good and I would come back. We ordered two cheese cake slices to go which were consumed for breakfast the next day.  Now, the cheesecake containers were really well thought out! Engineered for cheese cake and whip cream, clear plastic tops and very secure. I marveled at them for quite sometime before the boy threw them out so I would pay attention to the movie we ordered.

I feel like this location is smaller then usual but I still love the decor. The only reason this place doesn't get the normal 4 stars is becuase the waiter didn't seem to happy to be working with us and barley came around to ask us how our food was and everything. I ordered an entree I usually get and it didn't taste like normal so i brought it up to the waiter and long story short the waiter didn't handle it the best way possible and neither did the manager but in the long run the manager came back and addressed it properly so i will return and hope for a better time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=20

Fabs P.,"Huntington Station, NY",261,79,297,4.0,7/10/2016,I've been here a million times. This particular visit was great as usual. I will say this was my first time using the curb side to go towards the back of the restaurant. This gives you the ability to park and wait while your good comes out or quickly park and run in to grab your food yourself (limit of 10 mins). Either way it is a great perk!  So I had a bit of a sweet tooth and was in the mood for some cheesecake. But not just any cheesecake .... I was the salted caramel cheesecake. By far my favorite! Delicious! Creamy caramel cheesecake on blonde brownie with a crunch all topped off with a thick layer of the salted caramel. Yum! Oh and and don't forget the whipped cream on the side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=20
Lauren N.,"Old Bethpage, NY",122,88,120,1.0,9/24/2017,"I would give zero stars, but they get the one star only because the cheesecake was good. They failed to do anything else right. We went for my friends birthday. The wait at 5:30 was already an hour. I never understand why this place has such a wait!, but moving on, so we sat outside on the patio. It was actually really nice out and this was fine. The waiter came over and took our drink order. 5 drinks in total. 2 Arnold Palmers, a water, an iced tea, and a soda. So, the Arnie palmers come out and we're just kinda waiting around for the rest of our drinks. Our apps come out and still wondering, ""hmmm where are our drinks?"" I pull the waiter and ask if our drinks (not delayed 15 mins) are on the way. He literally looks at me like I have 5 heads and asks ""a dr. Pepper?"" I said yea and a water and an iced tea...So he goes off to get those. They finally get delivered when we're done with our apps. Moving on, we order our meals. I order a salad with balsamic dressing on the side. Long story short, my salad comes swimming in ranch dressing. I pull him aside and say, ""hey, there's a problem, my salad is covered in BBQ ranch dressing. I asked for balsamic on the side."" He says, ""oh no that's white ranch."" OKAY SO MY HEAD ALMOST EXPLODED! I think I laughed so I wouldn't go insane. ""Ok, but that's not what I ordered."" He stood there sooo freaking dumbfounded and finally took the salad away. He then conferred with the manager. So, I watched as everyone ate. It soon was 6, 630, almost 645. GUESS WHAT?! No salad. So we asked for a manager. We found the waiter who said the salad was on the way and we ordered another round of drinks. Drinks come out and the Arnie Palmers look suspiciously like they are just lemonade. But no! Genius waiter says the iced tea is just ""mixed in this time."" He then places a half full glass of tea in front of me with no ice in it. Literally, I almost jumped out of my chair. My friends husband started yelling ""dude what the hell is that?"" He stupidly comes back like ""what? What's wrong?"" I said, ""this is half a glass of tea and no ice."" He said ""oh there was no ice over here."" I wanted to throw it at him, but I somehow maintained my decorum. It took so much. I just said ""you have to be kidding me."" He said ""should I get you ice?"" I could have smashed my head into the wall. Was he high? Surely no one was this dumb. So off he went to get me ice. Finally, nearly 40 minutes later, we see him bringing my salad TO THE WRONG TABLE. The woman says it's not hers and he's like ""oh crap"". I say ""over here!"" At this point everyone else is done so he just says ""should I get you a box?"" My face must've looked like I wanted to freak out. He bring a box that way too small and someone at the table asks for a bigger one because at this point I think I'm incapable of speech. The manager finally swings by and we grab her. She gives a crappy apology and takes the salad and something else off the bill. This will go down in my top 3 most insane and horrible restaurant experiences.

Charlotte B.,"Glen Cove, NY",29,2,,3.0,7/28/2017,"So, I'm giving this a 3-star rating, because it's called The Cheesecake Factory, and I found that the cheesecake part of the cookie dough cheesecake wasn't very impressive. However, the S'mores cheesecake was scrumdidliumptious: so rich and creamy and downright delicious. Also, the chicken, mango, avocado salad was AMAZING, just a little skimpy on the chicken and mango, but still tasted great. Overall, a good experience.

And yes, I was disappointed at myself. But surprisingly, their food was pretty good. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta from their lunch special, and I really enjoyed it. The sauce went perfectly with the chicken and the bowtie pasta. The good thing about my meal here was that I really liked the pasta.

Unfortunately, after we received our appetizers, we waited about an hour and twenty minutes for entrees that never came. The server noted about 40 minutes into us waiting that the food was on its way. There was tables next to us that were sat after us and received their food and their check. Finally, the server brought an entree out, but it was only one and it wasn't what was originally ordered. I noted to the server that we ordered two entrees and what was brought out wasn't even what I ordered. Needless to say we asked for the check which took an additional 10 minutes.

My reply so you judge everyone based on that.  I even offered my credit card, even offered to pay for the meals upfront, and to be told not our policy. Policies are made to be broken especially if I was willing to pay ahead of time.  Cheesecake Factory is obviously a fly by night ""fast food"" place if they can't accommodate respectable people.

Autumn B.,"West Sayville, NY",84,2,,1.0,7/15/2017,"By far the worst experience ever; surprised as I've always been a fan. Should have had indication that this would be bad as gentlemen at table next to me complained that he was almost done with his meal and his protein still hadn't arrived.  So we sit down. My son orders a root beer, ceaser  salad no Parmesan cheese w steak (I had to remind the server to ask how he'd like it cooked) and his order came out fine. I ordered a club soda with lime, ahi tuni salad w dressing on the side with no carrots. Drinks come; he gets his club soda, I get a sprite- I  let the server know (very nice guy and is why I'm giving this a one star review). He replaced sprite with club soda- however bar never replaced the glass so now I have a healthy mix of club soda and sprite (I find this out later after I speak to the manager). I had to ask for bread (which is by far aside from cheesecake a favorite of mine) came with butter swimming in melting ice water. Ordered ahi tuni salad... this is served cold (yuck! Tuna pieces very small and ice chilled - meaning it was cooked earlier in the day and taken out later when ordered) requested it with dressing on the side and no carrots. Low and behold it comes swimming in dressing with additional dressing on the side....asked for the manager; explained why I wasn't happy as the tuna is cold, club soda was a sprite and the butter is swimming in ice water. I explained this isn't how an ahi tuna salad is made/served to which he repeatedly stated ' that's how it is here' advised I'm not happy with it to please bring me a menu. At this point is when I take a sip of club soda to find out they just dumped sprite out and refilled the same glass with club soda (gag.. not even a rinse out; forget a fresh glass). Server comes with menu, advised no longer interested in anything else, to just bring the check.  At this point bill comes and I see they nicely credited the ahi tuna salad but did not credit the unrinsed sprite/soda water. Which has me just peeved for basic hygienic reasons alone... Beware all those that choose to eat here 7/15/17 - as to response to review response - none appears from my response on google... so not sure whom you replied to.

The decor was an Egyptian theme with high ceilings, bar was nice and bottles stacked tall on glass shelves.  We felt Waiter Joe was rushing us a bit in the beginning but he warmed up a bit later.  He addressed our nut allergy concerns and actually looked into it more for us.  Drinks and apps came quickly with the right pace, he asked if we wanted bread which I thought was a bit strange, doesn't everybody get bread or did he not want to bother with the extra work? Apps were good, entrees followed shortly after.  My Hibachi steak was good but Luke warm, also the beef was marinated in a sweet sauce, too sweet for me!  My wife had the shrimp gumbo!! The sauce was an amazing spicy and extremely flavorful mixed broth!  It was fantastic, we also had a couple of pasta dishes which were good but nothing special to write about.  Biggest disappointment was the strawberry cheesecake, ok, but if your name is Cheesecake Factory, it should have blown my head off to Mars! My head stayed right there on my neck, and made me think about North Shore Farms Cherry Cheesecake instead.   After a few bites of our entrees, we all looked at each other and thought the same thing.....oh boy am I full!

My waiter, name unknown, simply wasn't amused by my enthusiasm. When I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I become the best version of myself. I sense the brown bread and I transform into someone with clear skin and a 4.0 GPA. Although my waiter did not contribute to this enthusiasm, he brought the 8th wonder of the world, brown bread. I wasn't sure what to order. I wasn't necessarily the hungriest I've ever been but I just can't pass up a good meal. After the brown bread, I got my meal. I chose a veggie burger and it was spectacular. However, I knew there was more potential. Once we ordered more brown bread, I figured it out. I stuffed my brown bread with veggie burger, pickles, and even a single French fry. It was the best decision I've ever made. Once we were done eating, our waiter's mood seemed to have changed. A once upset looking man turned into a happy and pleasant waiter. This helped my experience to become even better.

Christina R.,"Commack, NY",73,127,30,1.0,12/9/2015,"Let me start out by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory. I love the menu and always enjoy my food. I have visited several times throughout the years with no complaint. Until recently... My friend and I visited a few months back on a weekday. We were enjoying our meals which included appetizers, cocktails, entrees and desserts. All was well until a roach crawled up the wall and onto the table. We didn't freak out since there were other customers nearby and we have both worked in the restaurant business and sometimes roaches appear in restaurants-last thing we would want was to freak everyone out around us. We called over the busboy and who killed it for us and explained he would get the manager.  I wish I got the managers name but I didn't think I needed it because I assumed that we would get an apology and at the very least, some type of assurance that we would return. We got the apology but nothing else. Not a drink comp, appetizer or desserts. No discount on our bill either! I am still completely disgusted-not so much by the roach-but by the fact that the manager did nothing but utter an apology and an ""eh, you know...it happens"".  The ""Walt Whitman Shops"" attract people who are very, very quick to complain regarding just about everything; the clientele who frequent the upscale ""mall"" believe that they deserve nothing but the best. We could have made such a scene around these people regarding the roach or our treatment by the management but because the manager saw that we weren't that ""type"" our complaint was disregarded entirely. As I mentioned before, I have worked in the restaurant business and this manager was way off-no way do you let a customer leave without ensuring they would return after something as gross as a roach crawls near them while they are eating. HUGE fail on their part! There are also many other new restaurants that Walt Whitman Shops have added which I now frequent. Never will I return. Mr. Manager whom I wish I got your name: you're disgraceful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=60
Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",318,760,47,3.0,12/14/2014,"When thinking of the word 'epic', certain cultural milestones come to mind. Think Homer's Odyssey, the travels of Ibn Battuta, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia and of course, Gilgamesh. Enter the Cheesecake Factory's menu and  calorie count. Future archaeologists will excavate the premises and speculate what gods were worshiped here based on the pillars, Egyptian-like faces and a staff adorned in all white. Many myths focus on a book and Cheesecake Factory is no different. Here it's called the menu and you can spend days visiting and never have the ill fortune of ordering the same item twice. It is that exhaustive and awe-inspiring, where the list of cheesecakes alone tops 20 and begins to enter new area of combinatorial possibilities. (Like key lime pie? Then why not have a key lime pie cheesecake? Do that for 'insert the blank' dessert and you'll likely find a mutation on the menu in cheesecake form) But before this takes a turn into predictable elitist bashing of a form of dining popular with the entire world, let's not forget that Cheesecake Factory started out as a mom and pop shop, or in this case, bakery. By 1978, the bakery spawned a restaurant and nearly forty years later spans the globe. (I walked past one in a mall in Dubai). I'm never one to disparage success and so went into the Factory with an open mind, hungry for lunch. And lunch is available until 5pm which includes discounted prices and smaller, healthier portions on certain combinations. Think sandwich and salad, selected entrees and pizza/salad combo. I went for the pizza/salad combo but not after some serious soul searching and health considerations. The health social engineers who mandate calorie counts on menus managed to dissuade me from 2000+ calorie choices...this time. So my pizza margherita and caesar salad arrived fairly quickly but not so quick as to arouse suspicion of microwaving my meal. A crispy crust, not too much sauce and an acceptable mozzarella made me realize that this actually isn't that bad. In fact, several bites in and I was thinking this was better than some pizzerias and other restaurants with less corporate cred.  The caesar salad arrived in a plate and filled the plate to capacity. I grazed away on 3/4s of the salad before calling it quits so as to save room for the restaurant's namesake-- cheesecake! I'll also add that seating was exceptionally comfortable, the bathrooms cleaner than most and the staff friendly and accommodating.  Coming in at under 1000 calories is the strawberry cheesecake which I shared with my wife. There were many other temptations calling out to me involving peanut butter, bananas, chocolate, mousse and other sweet treats. I resisted and plunged my fork into the chunk of cheesecake adorned with strawberries and a sugary sauce.  Creamy, rich and cleaning the plate worthy, this cheesecake sold me on the premise that I will return in the future. While the menu is a virtual bible, skip to the last chapter for the revelation that is cheesecake and you'll be saved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=60

Brian S.,"Roslyn, NY",28,24,,3.0,8/15/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be my go to spot for end of the week binge eating sessions with a slice of cheesecake to seal the deal to bring me on the brink of unconsciousness from food coma related symptoms. Lately, the food has been just decent; there has definitely been a slight drop in quality. However, my biggest gripe is the tiny sliver of cheesecake you get when you order your dessert to go. My health can definitely benefit from eating less cheesecake, but for the premium price you pay, you should get a better product. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is ok; your friends will think you're 10.5% classier for choosing the Cheesecake Factory over Applebee's and Friday's, the portions are still enormous, the food is typically somewhat decent and you now pay more for less cheesecake.

Chris H.,"Dix Hills, NY",343,183,248,2.0,9/22/2014,"Some friends took us here for dinner the other night and I was a little disappointed. I heard so many great things about this restaurant but, as always, the experience did not live up to the expectations. One of the main reasons why we dined at Cheesecake was because our friends are addicted to the sweet corn tamale cakes and wanted us to try them. When we placed the order the waitress told us that they had run out of that appetizer. How does an established restaurant like Cheesecake Factory run out of an appetizer at 7:45 on a Tuesday evening? How is that even possible? The couple who took us there were devastated, however the waitress said that she would contact the manager to see if something could be done...a manager never came to the table. When the main courses arrived, only half of the table received their food. The other half had to wait another 10 minutes for the entrees to arrive. Why would you bring out only half of the meals knowing that it is rude to start eating when half of the table does not have a plate? By the time all of the food finally arrived, my food was cold. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combination with the steak cooked medium rare. When the dish arrived my chicken had no sauce and the steak consisted of only two small medallions that were overcooked. People have always told me that the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory were huge so, needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the size and execution of my dish. On a positive note, we enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which surprisingly was about 90% crab (which is rare to find) and it came with a delicious dipping sauce. Hopefully, if we come back, the food and service will be better. Perhaps Tuesday is not a good night to eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=60

Ellen E.,"Melville, NY",0,3,,3.0,3/16/2017,"My friend and I went to cheesecake factory on Walt Whitman Rd., Huntington today because we saw that they had new items on their menu. One of the items was a salad with chicken avocado and mango. The chicken was visible because they sliced that but the mango and avocado was diced into  very small cubes and not at all satisfying. It probably won't be that bad if they presented it differently. I think it should all be whole slices and not diced up like a plate for a child. Then we decided to have dessert. We were looking at the ice cream. They have a wonderful ice cream sundae with nuts and  hot fudge that is now  $8.50. They also have a bowl of plain vanilla ice cream. When I asked if I could have hot fudge over the plain bowl of vanilla ice cream I was told that it would be $.40 more than the Hot fudge sundae??

Karen M.,"Mineola, NY",0,16,,5.0,5/26/2015,"I'm somewhat mystified by The Cheesecake Factory. With a menu approximately the size of the Old Testament (complete with Talmudic commentary), you've gotta figure that a large percentage of their food has to come in frozen; how could it not be? No restaurant, especially a chain, could stock that many fresh ingredients, right? And yet, the food always tastes pretty darn good to me. Whether I get a tiny Endive Salad, a huge portion of Factory Huevos Rancheros for brunch, or the fried mozzarella balls for an appetizer, everything always tastes freshly-made and delicious. The Cheesecake *is* frozen, but it makes more sense to take that to go anyway, since you're usually too full after a meal there to indulge in dessert right away anyway (and their cheesecake softens up nicely a half-hour to an hour later.) Service at the Huntington location in particular has always treated me well, which isn't a small thing considering how busy it can get. I really don't understand how this restaurant does what they do, or if it's all an elaborate mind game I play on myself and the feeling of being inside a giant slice of cheesecake makes me think that the food tastes much better than it really does; maybe that makes more sense? Minor word of warning: I used to get the Factory Nachos, which were amazing, but the last few times we've gotten them, they just haven't been as good-- presentation is sloppier, components are too clumped together instead of spread throughout the plate, etc. Maybe this is just a fluke, but worth keeping in mind if you're in the mood for nachos; other appetizers are more consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=80

After finally being acknowledged, we have the waitress out order who acted as if she had hearing issues -I just knew our order would come out incorrectly and it did after waiting for almost 40 minutes without any acknowledgement from our waitress. She must have walked by 6/7 times before I had to get her attention to let her know the plates on the table were dirty. My husband received all of his food and I simply receive 1/3 of my meal for it to get cold as I waited for the rest of my meal. We both got meals that required syrup and didn't get syrup until 5 minutes later. Usually not a harsh critique but was very unpleased with our service. The manager came over to apologize, deflect and place blame on the team instead of taking full responsibility. He didn't agree to comp anything (not that we needed anything free) but damn at least the $3.50 cold coffee. Conversely, ate dinner at Del Frisco's the previous night and the service was impeccable.

Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1286,982,738,4.0,1/7/2013,"It's been several years since I've been to this location.  Came in with my family this past Sunday night and had a great experience.  Couldn't believe that there was a half hour wait at eight o'clock on a Sunday night but that was a good sign that they are constantly busy I guess! Again, haven't been to this location in years but my recollection was that the hostesses were always extremely unwelcoming and rude.  That aspect hasn't changed a bit.  Their stand offish demeanor is not the way I wanted to begin my night hence the four start rating instead of the five. Happy to say though, they played a very small role in our overall experience. The restaurant is huge, almost as big as their menu.  There are options for every kind of diner, meat-eaters, mexican lovers, dieters, vegetarians, children, and so on.  We were sat in a booth in the front section of the restaurant.  The area was set apart from the rest of the restaurant and it was pretty private which was nice.  Our table wasn't set though, some of us had forks some of us didn't, there were no napkins and the booths clearly weren't wiped from the party before us.  I'll blame the hostesses.  The bread brought to our table consisted of white and some sort of whole wheat.  Nix the white bread, it sucks.  The brown bread which apparently is some sort of whole wheat rye with molasses is delicious.  Our table stuck to waters but their drink selection was quite impressive.  We ordered the tex mex egg rolls off the regular menu and the asian chicken lettuce wraps off the SkinnyLicious menu.  I didn't taste the egg rolls but my family loved them.  The Asian chicken lettuce wraps were STUPID good.  I couldn't believe the nutrition content, again ordered off the SkinnyLicious Menu and they had less than 500 calories. They were fresh, inventive and just really good.  I would have ordered them again as my entree if I hadn't already placed an order for something else. My mouth is actually watering just thinking about how good they were.   Waiter was young and inexperienced because he failed to do simple things like clear empty water glasses and garbage off the table.  I'm extremely critical of things like that and my family isn't so it didn't bother them.  He was very nice however so again, not a big deal.   Entrees for the table included two four cheese pasta dishes with chicken, the burrito grande and spicy chicken salad off the SkinnyLicious menu.  All of the dishes were phenomenal.  Seriously, for a chain, VERY impressed.  Sundays are questionable for receiving fresh food but there was no doubt what we were eating was fresh and well prepared.  The portions were generous as well.  My only complaint is that the side of black beans served with the burrito were cold.  Really cold.    I love the fact that the menu includes the calorie information next to each item, however that was the main reason why we passed on dessert. Over 1000 calories for one slice of cheesecake!  Holy moly, we opted for frozen yogurt instead!  We played guess the check and were happily surprised by the outcome since we were all OVER the actual cost.  Reasonably priced for what we were given.  Definitely recommend this place.  Will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=100

I love their very varied menu and always find it difficult to choose something but we were all able to pick something and place our order quickly.  Then we waited for a long time for our food to arrive and when it did there was a problem with each of our meals.  While they took care of it I found that this Cheesecake Factory is not as good as the others I visit frequently at home in Las Vegas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=100
Lon G.,"Huntington, NY",194,343,46,5.0,6/9/2015,"My meal today was poifect!! Really! I started with the beets with goat cheese salad. I was struck by the endless different delicious tastes in it! Then came the hamburger- YES MY FRIEND! It was perfect charred and cooked exactly to my liking. I got mashed potatoes instead of the fries, and they were fresh and still had the tater skins in them. They did a great job today!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=100
Megan H.,"Long Island, NY",65,90,91,4.0,7/15/2013,"I can't believe the enormous portions in this place! I came here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The first time, I tried to be modest and ordered a chicken Caesar salad, which could have fed a hungry family of four, and it was delicious!  For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheeseburger, half of which filled me up and I had the rest for lunch a day or two later. If you are trying to maintain a girlish figure, this is not the dish for you. However, if you are into fried, cheesy, kind-of greasy goodness, dig in!  I couldn't decide what I wanted to order for quite a while, but our waitress was patient and friendly, AND she kept the appetizer breads coming to our table while we waited.  After dinner, my table shared the Hershey chocolate cheesecake which was good, but the real winner was the (huge) slice of carrot cheesecake that I took home to share with my mother. It was outstanding! I can't wait to get that again for myself (far too delicious to feel an ounce of guilt!). I was in an absolute food-coma when I got home from dinner. So very filling!  I also loved the cool upscale atmosphere in this place, but in denim shorts and a linen button-up, I didn't feel underdressed for the place. The prices were very reasonable as well.

They can't ever seem to cook a burger right the first time but once they do get it right it tastes great but watch out because its gigantic and theres no smaller option.

The manager wouldn't let us go and when he did decide, he even thought about bout charging us for the appetizer we never got! Which is whatever who cares because we were dying to get out!

What a hard decision, Finally after a short debate i settled on the Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake with whip cream and strawberries. I took it to go and headed home to eat dinner and then the cheesecake. It took all my will power to not pull over and start munching on it. Needless to say it was deeeeee licious every bite. Generally the place is packed, But they move along quickly as there are tons of tables. Can not recommend the food so much but the cheesecake you don't know what you are missing till you try it.

I usually never write these, but with how much my mom and I were disrespected, I felt I had to say something. We waited at least 35-40 mins for our food maybe more for 2 simple chicken dishes. One was the pasta with scampi sauce and chicken. The other, grilled chicken with farrow and vegetables. After this very long wait, they gave her farrow hard as rock! We were both very annoyed after this and kindly asked the waitress for the manager. The manager himself took at least 15-20 mins just to get to us! My mom explained the situation and he promised to give her fresh farrow and not charge for the meal. He should have also given me my meal for free. She waited at least 25 mins for the new farrow! 25 mins after all that we endured! May I mention, in between all of this our waitress keep disappearing. I had to call her over when she went to other tables because she was not stopping at ours. My mother told me when she got back from the bathroom, all of the stalls locks were broken. This place is falling apart! I have never been more disrespected at any establishment in my life. My mom and I have been going to this Cheesecake for years and it used to be great. We have given them plenty of money from business and this is the thanks we get? Unacceptable. I wish I didn't have to give this place any stars. We will never be coming here again.

Shana K.,"New York, NY",5,25,1,1.0,3/1/2014,"TAKE-OUT I love the cheesecake factory and they consistently have good food and good portions.  The menu rarely changes and the specials have been the same for years, but that's not my problem right now.   I've ordered take out a number of times, over 10 times and I'm at the point where I'm so annoyed I must say something.  You must check your bags before you leave because so often I have to go back for them leaving out an entree.  This happened last night and we were so annoyed.  All they offered us was a free piece of cake, and I don't eat cheese cake, but thanks anyway.  Also, the take-out portions, unless you're getting a salad are extremely stingy.  Many times I've ordered grilled salmon, I don't eat potatoes or fries, so I get extra broccoli.  Last time I literally got 4 pieces of broccoli and that was it.  Last night I ordered chicken with asparagus and couscous, and I literally got a spoonful of couscous and 3 pieces of asparagus.  I know what you're thinking, this girl is fat and just wants huge portions, and I'm nothing of the sort, I want a good amount of food for what I paid for.  I know for a fact that If I am in the restaurant and ordered the same meals, which I have, I get a lot more broccoli, I get more than 3 pieces of asparagus.  It's as if they don't care because we are going home and won't come back, they can just throw in whatever.  I hate paying $26 for salmon and broccoli and I get a good size of the protein, and what is clearly not extra broccoli.  I think you need to check all your food before you get back in your car or else be prepared to back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington?start=140

Lili Z.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",2,39,6,4.0,9/26/2012,"Love The Cheesecake Factory! If it weren't for the crowds I would eat there a lot more often. The food and service are always dependable. I like the new Skinnylicious menu with lower calorie counts and healthier choices. Some of the choices are the same as the regular menu and I can't taste much of a difference. I usually order my favorite...the white chicken chili. It is really flavorful with a little spicy kick. I also like the tuna tataki salad with it's slightly seared sesame crusted tuna slices and a salad with asian dressing. My son always gets the Chicken Romano. The chicken is pounded flat and crusted with cheese and served with pasta. The portion is so huge there is usually left overs and it's really big enough to share. Other dishes I've tried and liked are the Chicken Madeira and the Baja Chicken Tacos. Not to mention the amazing desserts. The cheesecakes are to die for but they are very rich and heavy, so I find that sharing is a good idea. I really like the atmosphere, the high ceilings and open floor plan give you the sense it is not as crowded as it really is. While is can be noisy, it's never too loud for conversation and you have plenty of room at the over-sized booths and large tables. My daughter had a birthday party here and they were very organized and accommodating to our needs.  I don't hesitate to recommend The Cheesecake Factory.

Odd...I can't figure out whether the chicken is already mixed in with the other ingredients (in which case just tell me they can't make it without chicken) or the chef doesn't understand the concept of a meat-free diet. Either way, I got my meal for free, but by the time my second burrito came out, my family was done eating and there was no time to order a new meal :( Just giving that anecdote to warn vegetarians to stick with the already meatless dishes.
