Jasmit D.,Livermore  CA,5,67,48,11/24/2017,5.0,We came here on 11/18/2017 after my Graduation. There was a party of 15. We were seated within a good amount of time  and our two servers were Lexy and Michael  and boy were they great! Lexy was so polite and had a smile on her face the whole time. I would notice her talking to other tables as well  and with same  vibrant smile. Michael was also really good. Great customer service to the both of them. They handled our party very well  they were courteous  good on time  prompt  fast  thorough. I would love to have these server every time to take care of a big party like that! our food was given on time  tasted wonderful! Thanks Lexy and Michael for making my special day even better.
Makaela M.,Sacramento  CA,321,49,34,11/17/2017,4.0,The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 were the front ladies. When we put down our names down and she told us the wait time (45 minutes) my friends and I were debating if we should stay or go else where. While decided she gave us a dirty look and was not welcoming. She also didn't greet any of us. She didn't seem like she was enjoying her jobHOWEVER OUR WAITER TONY WAS AMAZING! This guy was so happy to take our order  give suggestions  talk to us about the menu and our day. I usually don't remember waiters names but definitely remembered his. The food was great as well. I recommend the Parmesan chicken
Rebecca J.,Monterey Park  CA,3,238,2,11/15/2017,1.0,This used to be the spot for me to grab a bite after a shopping sesh but the last five times I've been here have been far from great. Today was it for me  and not the good kinda it. More evil like IT  the clown. We arrived. Wait was supposed to be 25 mins. No Biggy since most wait at any BJs fall within the 20-50 min range. Twenty mins in  the host told us there's a booth available and that we better run before it gets taken. Not sure why she said that because there were two booths available. Guessing she was just lazy and didn't want to walk us there  so we ended up menu-less for about 20 mins. We were able to order a drink and an appetizer. 15 mins later the appetizer comes out and our server was still nowhere to be found. We had to get someone to call him. Once we got his attention  I asked if we could please get the check because the service and the wait was beyond mediocre. We were starving! Took him five mins to bring us the check  which he rudely dropped off at our table. Another five mins later  He then asked us if we were going to eat it. We said no  box please. Then he started with an attitude on whether or not we wanted to speak with the manager  as if we were offending him. We weren't. We just wanted to leave to go eat somewhere more efficient. Even with that  it took him another five mins to bring back our change and then another three for the box. Strange thing to do when you know someone wants to GTF out. Yeah  so no more BJs at Arden for me. Ended up at Applebee's which I don't even like at all  but at least the service is way better.
Heike S.,Sacramento  CA,30,104,61,11/11/2017,3.0,It has been years since I have been here  but a friend and I wanted snacks and cocktails so we decided BJ's would be fine. That was a mistake  especially on a Friday night. You need to be prepared. The line to check in was pretty long  and we got up it was a 90 minute wait for two of us. There was no room at the bar so we decided to walk around the mall and get a coffee. Literally the moment We sat down with our coffee  I get a text that the table is ready. We ended up ordering one combo appetizer plate and hickory smoked sausage  as well as margaritas. The margaritas were great! The appetizers on the other hand  lacked flavor. Nothing had a distinct seasoning. The hickory smoked sausage came out cold and we sent it back to be reheated.My synopsis: come here for margaritas. Or beer.The two of us spent about $75 for 2 margharita each and appetizers. That's fairly pricey. Ambiance is very loud. Our server was nice  but when he went on break his replacement constantly came to the table to ask if we needed anything  To the point where I feel he wanted us to clear the table and leave.P.S Mall parking is already holiday crazy.
Rumeet R.,Woodland  CA,17,30,18,11/27/2017,1.0,Fingers crossed I don't get food poisoning. Such a disappointment. The customer service was great for the food has definitely gone down hill. I'm so grossed out.. the chicken was extremely undercooked. I'll let you refer to the picture.. goodluck if you decide to eat here. They did return my money but.. was it really worth it.
Christopher C.,Sacramento  CA,1327,720,1055,10/7/2017,4.0,Decent lunch for a decent price. I was not too happy with the wedge salad I ordered which for some reason the kitchen thought it would be funny to put so much dressing on that the waitress asked me if I would like another plate to eat it; ridiculous. Not sure I will be back. This could have easily been a lower 3-star review and only the quality of the pizza I had ordered made up for the kitchen silliness. Service was average and absent. The waitress was too busy to pay attention to simple requests. Seen better but try for yourself; not sure I will be back as there are other choices right next door. Ask for dressing on the side for sure!
Henry L.,San Mateo  CA,2325,832,2735,6/26/2017,5.0,Nice restaurant!Located right in the Arden mall  this place is actually pretty nice. The wait is not long--there are lots of seats and they are just the right amount to fit all the customers. Other BJ's I've been to have 1+ hr wait.The food is good. We got the burger and the seared tuna salad. The seared tuna salad tasted fresh  especially the tuna which was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The salad was dressed well. The burger was awsome too  especially the bun which was toasted just right. The beef patty had a smokey bbq flavor  as did the bacon. The fries were think but also crispy. Overall  tastes like just how I'd imagine a summer BBQ would be :)The serve staff are all very nice  and very knowledgeable. I asked about how the different kinds of burgers were different even though on paper they looked the same  and the serve staff explained everything well. When I chose a burger  the staff actually pointed out a cheaper item that is the same burger  just worded differently.Overall  this is a really nice BJ restaurant  compared to other ones I've been to! Nice!
A M.,Carmichael  CA,0,16,21,11/26/2017,4.0,I love this place  nice & professional service  food is fresh and the menu ..... so various!! Coming back definitely!!
Joe R.,Sacramento  CA,14,77,145,6/20/2017,4.0,BJs is a great chain restaurant to come to. I've being going to BJs for years and the food and drinks  food  and pizookie are always pretty much the same  the service is really what makes the difference. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the location. It's at the mall  parking is awful  and it gets pretty packed. Other than that my experience here was great. Service - the service was good. We luckily were able to snag a table in the bar area since the place was so packed. our waiter was very attentive. He even made recommendations for drinks and pizookie flavors. Drinks - there are a wide variety of beers on tap  wine  and specialty cocktails! My personal favorite is the Jeremiah red! It's malty and has a pretty high alcohol content for a beer. Food - there is a wide variety of American foods ranging from pizzas  burgers  flat breads  steak  and pastas. Pizzas and burgers are always a solid choice when coming to a BJs. For an appetizer  we ordered a small bites trio or couscous Mac and cheese  garlic Parmesan carrots  and ginger creamed corn. And let me say OMG get the couscous Mac and cheese! 'Nuff said! For my main entree  I ordered the jalapeo burger which was great! I'm not too keen on spiciness  but this was a manageable spicy. The heat went away and it wasn't one of those long lasting spiciness. Dessert - PIZOOKIs! We got the trio sampler with the triple chocolate pizookie  salted caramel pizookie  and the monkey bread pizookie. The triple chocolate was a little too chocolatey  but it's in the name. The salted caramel is my favorite and will always recommend it!
Winston W.,Sacramento County  CA,4,199,2,11/30/2017,2.0,The decor is 4 stars. Their baby back ribs are no more than 2. I enjoyed being in the restaurant until the food arrived. Dry & crunchy all the way through to the bone. I'll come again but not for the baby backs.
Brittany B.,El Dorado Hills  CA,158,35,,12/2/2017,5.0,1st visit in to this location and a pleasant experience! We have dined at several BJ's and have received bad service  good service  and everything in between. Cynthia M. was our waitress and she was wonderful. She was very accommodating and friendly. The food was good as always but our night wouldn't have been as enjoyable if not for the amazing service. Kudos!
Diane J.,Cardiff by the Sea  CA,21,75,,11/9/2017,3.0,We sat in the training section and our server was a bit confused about the soup and salad option. Once that was sorted out  it was just a matter of waiting for my food. The salad came straight away. The soup... didn't. I was there with my boss  who ordered wings and a pizza and had finished eating before my soup finally arrived. Turned out the kitchen needed to make a new batch of Broccoli Cheddar. Had they told me that from the beginning  I may have opted for something different. The real frustration was that the broccoli was still ice cold. It was just a matter of stirring it into the cheese  which was appropriately heated  but it seemed like they should've done that in the kitchen. Still  it was clear that the server was trying to make me happy  my boss really liked his food and in the end  I did enjoy my order. All's well that ends well.
Jen B.,Sacramento  CA,40,53,6,11/11/2017,1.0,"Just went here to honor my late father-in-laws birthday. Waited over 5 minutes for the table to be bussed  finally approached a group of 4 waitresses that were talking about going out plans. I asked if the table could be bussed and they said  ""there is like only one busses here now sooooo..."". They look at me  dumb eyed and far too comfortable in their service position to clean a table. They then watched as I made 4 trips to buss the table myself. They never offered to help or did any actual work. The actual service was painfully slow. We ended up leaving before our celebratory beer or birthday cookie arrived. What was total bullshit is even though we weren\'t getting service and I saw other tables give up  there was no shortage of staff just leaning on walls chitchatting. Don\'t waste your time here."
Dave M.,Sacramento  CA,1,5,1,11/16/2017,5.0,The pizookie here is amazing! Best desert I've had in a minute. I would definitely recommend coming here with the family.
Lsxo S.,Sacramento  CA,1,92,61,11/13/2017,5.0,Took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner. And I must say  everything was so good. And the server was very attentive. I will defiantly be back again.
Chuck M.,Rocklin  CA,289,217,2063,2/27/2017,3.0,With chain restaurants you typically know what to expect. What's on the menu  quality of food  service  etc. BJ'S seems to be an exception to this in some regards. Dined here on two consecutive evenings recently with two different experiences. The first evening I was given an estimate of 5-10 minutes for a table but the actual wait ended up being about 30 minutes. Service on both evenings was spotty with drink refills slow on the first night and non-existent on the second. I've also found that the quality of food varies surprisingly from location to location. In the greater Sacramento area  Roseville is tops  Natomas is at the bottom (got sick eating there)  and Arden is somewhere in the middle. In regards to meat  be aware that medium = well done.On my second night eating here  once I informed my server that my table was just having dessert (having already eaten dinner at a restaurant down the street)  she quickly became short. Once the order was placed she did not return to check on us again. I couldn't finish the sweet and salty dessert due to water running dry. Don't know that I'll go to this particular BJ'S again. I'll probably stick to the Roseville BJ's where everything is consistently above average.
Ashley H.,Sacramento  CA,1,7,7,11/29/2017,2.0,I love Bjs...however they have the WORST large party policies EVER. I tried making reservations a week in advance for a large party however the manager stated that they couldn't make reservations from 6pm to 8pm. Then he told me to call ahead that night. Well now there new policy is call ahead can only be a party of 6. So they won't put me on the call ahead list. I just want to eat with my family of 10. Thats it. Its ridiculous. Please change the ridiculous large party policies!
Ken L.,Northern California  CA,227,131,2081,7/5/2017,4.0,The food was good  but was surprised it took a little longer than expected since there weren't hardly any one in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and made sure I was happy and apologized for the food delay so that made up for waiting a bit on the food. This is a great place to stop for a bite when at the mall.
Matt C.,Bellflower  CA,290,220,299,2/4/2017,5.0,We were at the mall waiting for a custom T-Shirt to be made. We were just walking around - killing time - when we happened upon the BJ's Restaurant. I am a fan of BJ's Restaurants. We are regulars at the one in Downey in Southern California. Tuesdays are the best days there because they have Half Price Wine - ALL DAY.But anyway we walked in and bellied up to the bar. We were greeted within seconds by a pleasant and cheery Bartender by the name of Rachael. We chatted briefly and she took our beverage order. Rachael recommended the Piranha Pale Ale for me and my friend had some berry flavored cider drink. Our beverages were promptly served. The beer was nicely chilled and very tasty. Not too hoppy - just like she said. She returned within a couple of minutes to offer us some food - which we declined. We just stopped in for a beverage. She was busily performing her BT duties but managed to spend a couple minutes here and there having conversation with us. Whilst sitting there we met a very nice gentleman named Jonathon. He was a guest at the bar as well. We had a great conversation about two of my favorite topics - Corvettes and driving.So Rachael was great  the beer was great  the conversation was great. The restaurant was not busy but was very clean including the restrooms. What more can a guy ask for?Jonathon - If you read this  it really was a pleasure meeting you.
Stephanie A.,Plantation  FL,61,30,106,7/19/2017,5.0,One of my favourite restaurants! I literally visit all the time. The menu is so diverse and they're is always something for everyone. Great happy hour deals and specials. I joined the membership and there are always great perks available. Btw  everything I have eaten there has been delicious. Not a single complaint!
Lyn G.,Sacramento  CA,95,119,88,3/26/2017,4.0,Have always liked BJ'S and have never been really disappointed with food or service. Of course  it's usually a wait to be seated  a wait for service  but that's what's to be expected. Food and service is always good. This visit we both had the rib eye steak with cheddar mashed potatoes and fulfilled asparagus. It was so good! Steak was juicy and flavorful  mashed potatoes were creamy and you could taste the delicious cheese  and asparagus (huge serving) were seasoned perfectly. This by far was the best meal I had at BJ'S! I highly recommend trying it!
Kiarra G.,Sacramento  CA,214,73,66,9/27/2017,2.0,"I frequent bj\'s often  but this particular visit was distasteful and I left feeling very dissatisfied. If I ever have to express my concern I usually do so in store but this day I was so worn out from work that I didn\'t have the time or energy being that it was later in the evening  Our server was named Patricia and she was cold  rude  and seemed as if we were bugging her. We ordered an appetizer  pizza  and pizookie. The appetizer was delish  but when our pizza came I noticed it had tomatoes which we asked to be excluded. As soon as I mentioned it to her she grabbed the pizza  rolled her eyes  and didn\'t say one word  no apology  no ""I will be right back "" nothing. After about 15-20 mins (which was expected since we figured they would have to make a new pizza) she returned with the same pizza and it was obvious that they only removed the tomatoes instead of making a new one.....it was cold and dry as if it was sitting in a warmer. Again I didn\'t complain  but when she never returned to ask how we were doing that is where my issue is  we were without water and needed refills but she was no where to be found  and I also noted she only had 2 other tables. Finally when she returned she brought us a box and we ordered dessert. It look 18 minutes for our pizookie to come out! The table next to us had ordered and received their food before our dessert even came out! Once we got up and asked for the check she ran our credit card at the table and said she would return with the receipt. We watched her go talk to other workers  hug a friend that came in and chat at the micro before returning with our credit card slip! My biggest problem is that she never apologized for the wait or the mess up (I checked the receipt and she had put in our pizza incorrectly)  she never came back to check on us  then she didn\'t even thank us when she dropped of the check."
Eric B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,2127,5344,4760,5/27/2017,3.0,"I recently ended up at this BJ\'s for Dinner one night. I was staying at the nearby Hilton  who kindly dropped me off here via their shuttle service. Otherwise  there was no way I was walking here  unless I wanted to end up as a pedestrian casualty.When I entered  the place was busy  happy  and noisy. I wasn\'t big on the noise  but there was a nice table available  and the service was friendly  helpful  and prompt throughout. The food and the beer (I had a red ale) were just OK. I had some sort of ""healthy"" stir fry dish  that probably wasn\'t all that good for me. The menu gives you the calories of everything  which ended up causing menu choice paralysis and choosing the best of the worst. The noise added to this confusion  which is why I wanted out of this place post haste. But just because this wasn\'t my thing  doesn\'t mean all of my happy fellow diners weren\'t a little more positive about their experiences."
Janelle M.,Fair Oaks  CA,4347,584,3499,11/2/2016,4.0,I stopped by BJ's for dinner with my honey. I downloaded the BJ's app and I must say I app is great! I like the fact you can reserve a time to dine in or pick up and once you check in at the front they state making your order immediately! In this case we dined in. We were greeted seated and 5 mins later our appetizers came out. I ordered the BLT salad and my honey ordered the Potato skins. I really enjoyed the salad the bacon was crispy and the dressing was delicious. 15 mins later out 2 pizzas came out I ordered the Chicken Philly Pizza it was different yet good they use a Sriracha cheese sauce in place of tomato sauce. The veggies on it was so greedy as well and had great flavor. The second Pizza was half Great White and Chicken Bacon Ranch. The great white was okay nothing special but  the Chicken Bacon Ranch had to be my absolute favorite. The pizza was nice and crispy and had lots of flavor down to the crust having great flavor that the other Pizzas lacked. For the restaurant to be as busy as it was our waiter was still very attentive and made sure or refills of water never totally empty.Next time I'm going to check out BJ's for there happy hour drinks and eats. They also have a nice full bar with plenty of TV's to watch the game which is a huge plus. I  also liked that I could pay my bill from my cellphone  so very convenient!
Corie L.,Burbank  CA,419,380,689,6/12/2017,4.0,Came here for lunch and ordered a small meal since I didn't want leftovers afterwards. I did end up having trouble finishing my food so I had my coworker eat it. BJs is a chain so it's nice their standard is kept the same through out all their restaurants.
Vincent V.,Chico  CA,16,259,5,9/26/2017,3.0,On the pricier side  but the service was very friendly and prompt for how packed it is.The quality isn't worth the price you pay  and the portions aren't much either. However  it is at the Arden-Arcade Mall so you can always go shopping to burn those calories afterwards. The staff were extremely friendly and they gave our good friend a birthday present (forgot the name of their signature desert). I can see BJs here as a go-to spot for celebration.
Johnson R. H.,San Jose  CA,271,11,56,5/8/2017,5.0,ATTENDEES & SITUATION:The service was on point. There were several big parties and they did not skip a beat. We were part of a volleyball tournament near the Cal Expo Center. Apparently  there was a prom near by and they  as well  had many parties as well. I arrived later to my party of 24 guest. Our tables were split between the parents & adults and girls volleyball players.CUSTOMER SERVICE:I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and pizza. I was never with an empty glass. Our server kept the refills coming. I can't imagine I how many other other glasses he had to tend to. They were all dressed clean and looked very proper to serve. All our food came in a timely manner and just about the same time for each person. Our table was tended by several servers and each and everyone of them handled all our special request regardless if it was their main table; more refills  extra plates  more dressing  milk  utensils  etc. This was the most impressive thing  great customer service.FOOD:The only challenge we had was the 5 Meat Pizza I ordered. It was a bit on the salty for my taste. It could of been caused by the bacon. But it was still hot and fine to eat.EXTRA:Aside the food  we were able to serve a cake specially made by one of the parents. The servers even provided plates and forks for us. With all the big parties there  the table configuration still gave us ample room to surround the birthday girl and sing happy birthday to her.At the end  when the bill came  they were able to split the bill and pair them up with each parent & child. Talk about a juggling act! On point!!ALL-IN-ALL:I would definitely recommend and suggest BJ's Restaurant when in town again. Food was hot  world class customer service. Great Experience!!
Jess J.,Winters  CA,0,23,6,11/16/2017,4.0,We chose to eat here after our eye exam a few suites down. The man found a coupon online and we decided to give them a try. It had been 7 years the last time we tried this chain in another city. The special was to order $35 of food and get $10 off. Restaurant was busy  got sat down quickly and was waited on by Michael B. He was great  not to chatty  courteous and  recommended the hot wings. For drinks we got my ice tea and the mans Hefeweizen and later a Piranha Pale Ale. We ordered two appetizer's. One was the bone in chicken wings-hot and lemonPepper flavored. The other was chips  salsa and guacamole. They were good  can't complain. For the main we ordered the deep dish medium pizza called  BJ favorite. It was really good pizza. The crust was crispy and not greasy and the vegetables were fresh! We mentioned just before ordering that we would use the special and at the end of dinner he mentioned that he would have to run that by the manger. We sat and waited a few minutes and thought maybe we would have issues. He came back showed the new total with $10 off! People forget that even with a coupon or Groupon used that one should tip based on the Original amount! Service industry is tough. The restaurant got really busy as we left with full tummies and good service. We thought that the chain should mention the special to patrons in the beginning of their meal because who wouldn't want to save a few bucks.
Diana H.,Zephyr Cove  NV,312,131,413,2/21/2017,4.0,I've been to many BJ's across west of the US. This one is at the Arden Mall in Sacramento. Great location. Quick and no fuss service. Just exactly what we needed today..The derby Cobb salad was excellent with very good house made avocado dressing. My husband had 12 oz rib eye with Brussel sprouts and asparagus. Cooked to medium temp  perfect. Both dishes perfectly gluten free and paleo.The place was getting packed before noon. Good sign. Clean and good environment. Definitely on the list to return if in the area.
Adeniji A.,Sacramento  CA,0,3,2,6/29/2017,1.0,I am not please with this restaurant today was my second time of visiting and I ended up been so disappointed I was at the Arden mall outlet today and I ended up waiting for for almost 1hr for my food to come and at the end of the day the rice was cold I was so upset that I asked for my manager I don't see why a customer should wait soLong before a order comes I would never visit bjs again I ended up leaving unhappy and satisfied attached is check in time and screen shot was when they brought the food a hell of a l
Cassandra I.,Sacramento  CA,5,11,7,9/3/2017,2.0,I should of ordered from Natomas Location. Food was fine but I also got the couscous mac&cheese....BUT! The amount i had gotten was way less than what I paid for. I probably got not even half a cup of it looks more like 1/3 of a cup. Usually they would have it filled in Natomas but I guess not here on Arden location. Felt like i just wasted money just to get an half empty bowl.
Shelby G.,Elk Grove  CA,11,156,44,3/11/2017,4.0,My daughter and I had lunch at BJ's this past Wednesday; we were there to celebrate my birthday. I opted for the fettuccine Alfredo which had chicken and broccoli in it. I had a side size Cesar salad. Because it was my birthday we could have had the ginormous chocolate cookie with ice cream; we were too full and passed on dessert.No matter which BJ's I visit and have a meal  the food is consistently good. This location didn't disappoint. I love the Cesar salad  as does my daughter. Although I normally get a sandwich or fish and chips  I opted for the lunch size pasta. It was really very good. The broccoli was exceptional. Good customer service  reasonable pricing  great menu selections and consistently good food. My daughter and I will continue to have lunch at BJ's.
Jarrod F.,Sacramento  CA,7,9,,8/9/2017,1.0,The experience here tonight was an epic failure. First  we were sat in the middle of the room and when I asked for a booth because of my wife's phobia of sitting in the situation was sold a song and dance by the hostess and told no. But the server was more than happy to do so. Appetizer and drinks came on  but when entrees arrived the circling toilet water began to go down. Our stakes arrived seriously under cooked mine ordered medium  was served rare and my wife's ordered well done came medium. After a 20 minute re-fire time  my steak came medium well and my wife's sides were changed saying they were out of carrots. The manager came to help resolve the issues but still  the night spiraled down. 45 minutes for dessert  the bill and one more entree( ordered with dessert  and came out 15 minutes after the dessert) the server picks up my card and now 15 minutes passed to get it back. In 2 hours and 20 minutes  the tables in front and back turned over twice. This is reason enough not to increase the minimum wage for such incompetence.
Kim H.,Sacramento  CA,521,84,250,10/15/2016,5.0,I don't know why the rating is so low  but I personally think BJ is really good in terms of service and food quality.My friend and I came in on a busy dinner weekend and we got served in about 15 min when they said the wait would be 30. The server came right away to get our drinks and the food took about 7-10min to come. I've tried many things on their menu including pasta  pizza  flat bread and clam chowder bowl. And my favorite desert that I would get every time is the Pizooki. Price is reasonable  portion is big and quality is delicious. Tony  who took our order  was pleasant and fast. He even took off the $2.75 on my chowder bowl because I mistook the price I was paying for. I give BJ a five star for that. BJ is definitely the place I'd come back over and over again when I'm at Arden Fair Mall.
Michael C.,Irvine  CA,456,58,85,1/18/2017,1.0,"This place makes me sick  and I mean literally. The staff were extremely helpful and nice  but holy hell did I have a problem with their food today. I was pretty crunched on time today since I had to drop off my iPhone at the Apple Store for a battery replacement and then had to go back to work immediately after. I looked up some restaurants at the mall and decided  ""Hey  why NOT go to BJ\'s?"" Well  today\'s visit answered that question pretty clearly. I was helped pretty promptly by one of the folks at the take-out counter  and she offered a few suggestions. I eventually decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger and the Potstickers to bring back to the office to eat. I ordered the food and made my way over to the Apple Store while I waited on my food. By the time I dropped off my phone  the food was ready and I gave my thanks and departed to work. I gave the potstickers to my co-worker as I ate the bacon cheeseburger while I was working. About half-way through  I looked at the burger and realized I made a huge mistake. The inside of the burger was not cooked at all. I\'ve had my fair share of medium-rare burgers in my day  and this was not that. After work  I made my way back to Arden Fair to pick up my iPhone and made a stop at BJ\'s again before I left. I brought the remains of the burger and showed it to a different person at the take-out counter and she said  ""Yeah! Medium-rare is supposed to be undercooked like that!"" That\'s when I took inspiration from my hero  Gordon Ramsay  and used my hands and opened up that patty to reveal the insides. She got the manager  and I asked very specifically whether the medium-rare burgers were supposed to look like that  and he agreed that many parts of the patty appeared uncooked. He took down my name  phone number  and e-mail to get a voucher for a replacement burger. (I was sent a $25 gift voucher from BJ\'s)I\'m not sure whether I\'ll take them up on their offer for another burger; I haven\'t even gotten the voucher yet  but if it\'s going to make me feel nauseous again  no thank you."
Nina W.,Roseville  CA,6,41,20,2/14/2017,3.0,Curbside service: Fast Tomato bisque: thumbs down I pulled into curbside and ordered tomato bisque  which came out in less than 5 minutes. Opened the lid and it looked like someone poured pizza grease from an extra large pizza into my cup. I ran in for an exchange  got a new soup and came back to my car... same thing. Half greasy oil/ half soup. I did end up calling the manager who offered a refund  which I appreciated.
Melissa S.,Sacramento  CA,19,490,297,7/31/2017,2.0,I've come here many times in the past and have had much quicker service. Everytime I've come I've sat in on of the booths in the bar. The food was very tasty. I had the salmon and he had the ribs. Service was fine  I think it was just slow kitchen service.
Alex N.,Arlington  VA,244,101,32,7/27/2017,3.0,Solid 3 star. If you've ever been to a BJ's before  you know what you're signing up for and this locations holds true to the brand. I'm basing my rating primarily on the food - have had BJ's pizza before  and was pretty darn impressed. This night  however  it just wasn't the same. I hear that with chain restaurants  kitchens can vary dramatically  so I'm afraid this may not be the top tier BJ's kitchen. Would recommend to management to assess that. Otherwise  service was good  water was always filled - would be back if the time was right.
Preet K.,Yuba City  CA,0,3,2,11/26/2017,1.0,I love BJ's but i'm giving this one star to a server name Lydia. We were just there and this lady wasn't professional at all. She looked and talked to my fianc the whole time and ignored me like I'm not even there. My fianc over heard an older lady say the same thing to her husband that Lydia was only talking to him and not even looking at her. Anyhow when we asked for the check she ignored me again and asked my fianc if we are paying separate in a very unprofessional manner which we found very INSULTING cuz I'm sure it was pretty obvious that we are a couple if she didn't notice my ring. Customer service should be a significant part of the job description when BJ's hire these people. This wasn't our first weird encounter there but this particular one was a bit insulting.
Summer M.,Sacramento  CA,462,768,1213,12/28/2016,3.0,"I don\'t usually eat at chain restaurants like BJ\'s  but we stopped in since we were at the mall and starving- and the experience was pretty legit. It was the lunch rush with several people waiting for tables  but we were seated right away. The wait time for ordering/getting our food was not too bad- maybe 5 minutes til they came to take our order  10-15 until we were served. I got a orange cream craft soda and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos  and both were delicious. (Plus  as one of the ""Enlighted Favorites""  the tacos were quite diet-friendly. Score!) Plus they have some kind of rewards program for regular customers that my friend swears by.If you\'re at the mall and want something more substantial than greasy food court fare  give BJ\'s a try."
Donna S.,Roseville  CA,620,709,1055,12/11/2016,5.0,This was my first time in a BJbrew house in any location . It was very comfortable . It's Christmas time so they are extremely busy . The menu is extensive and all sorts of choices from different types of food.Our server was excellent . Very sincere and helpful. Very personable. The food came out quickly and was very satisfying . It's a big place and popular . It's great for families!Yes the sound level is high but is a fun place with plenty of action. If your into sports it's all around you on tvs. You name it   it's on. Fun place and good food!
Ashley S.,Sacramento  CA,14,89,87,6/30/2017,3.0,BJ's restaurant is great when it comes to a nice casual dinner with some friends. Their menu has plenty of different things for anyone to try. I just wish their service was consistent. Some days I would sit  order  eat  and settled out in 45 minutes. Went there a few days ago and it took about 30-40 minutes for our food to come out and we have finished eating  it took about another 30 minutes just to find our server to get our check  and another 15 minutes to get us settled out! We were almost late to our movie..we ordered about 5:45 and we didn't leave until 7:20..when our movie was starting!
Missy T.,Colusa  CA,16,12,2,9/28/2017,1.0,"My husband and I arrived early for dinner with my brother and his wife. I\'ll say we got there at 6:10 for our 6:30 dinner and put our name on the list while we waited for them to arrive. We happened to get sat before their arrival  wonderful we can get a couple drinks and order our appetizer while we wait for them. Our waitress shows  takes our drink order  a Dr Pepper for myself and an 805 for the man  we also ask for the Poke appetizer. She asked if we wanted it started then  we say Yes. She brings back the waters and my Dr Pepper and says she\'ll be right back with his beer. At least 15 minutes passes  our guests join the table  our waitress shows again  to ask for their drink order  still no 805  she says she\'ll check on that for him. We order two more cocktails and a fancy root beer at this time  and she says the poke should be right out. She brings the 805  two cocktails and no rootbeer. ""the keg is flat"". Ok.. we order dinner  still NO appetizer  I order a pasta and added a caeser salad  everyone else orders  she disappears. About 5 minutes later  my salad comes out  still NO appetizer. At this point my husband leaves our group to tell her to go ahead and cancel the scoop of raw fish that has literally taken close to 45 minutes at this point. Dinner comes  my pasta isn\'t everything I hoped for  it\'s bland  cold  and mushy. After dinner we wait with dirty plates for what we assume is the check... Nope  not once  not twice  but THREE times she came back to ask if we wanted dessert. We said No  thank you  ALL 3 TIMES! So now our nice quick dinner with family turned into a 2 hour affair where we didn\'t even get our appetizer. The restaurant was not packed  it wasn\'t busy  many open tables.No table touch by management  EVER. I even left the table under the guise of using the restroom to find the manager to try to get some assistance  and I wasn\'t able to locate one  although I didn\'t specifically ask for one. As the manager  you should be visible and available to your customers. Your corporate office should be embarrassed. And if it\'s local owners  even worse. Lost long time customers this evening. Do yourself a favor  go somewhere else. Poor ServiceSubpar food& a timesuck."
Sereena T.,Sacramento  CA,117,108,74,2/23/2017,5.0,So convenient to have the curbside pick up parking even at the mall! Lately I have been ordering over the phone -- You park in the assigned curbside parking  call the to-go line and they will bring your order out! This location in particular seems super loud  and I was freezing last time I went for drinks with a friend  so I am not too compelled to dine in. I do not have any complaints about the food. It is not gourmet food  so I do not expect anything to decadent or fancy  but I do appreciate a precise and complete order every time I come!
Nate S.,Carmichael  CA,35,9,,8/2/2017,5.0,This BJs location is AWESOME!!!! Excellent service  great food  nice drinks and most importantly an amazing staff! The bartender Sara is fantastic  she always makes the drinks perfectly  provides world class customer service  and is very personable! She definitely deserves a raise for all of her hard work! :) I am a regular and she provides the most superior customer service out of anybody! (But all the employees at this location are great!)5 stats just because of Sara!
Raquel A.,Orangevale  CA,40,64,13,9/8/2017,1.0,I don't like going to a sit down restaurant and having a stressed out waitress because you guys sat her SIX TABLES all within 15 minutes  with one of them being a 10 person table. So not only was she hardly around and spoke a mile a minute  our salad and soup/entrees came out two minutes apart  and the food was barely lukewarm. So we spent almost 90 dollars on a shitty meal that wasn't hot  with a waitress doing the best she can with hosts who could give a shit less that she's one person trying to fufill the needs of 26 people all at different tables. To top it off  managers just stand around at this location. Most of our meal was seeing two assistant managers in clear sight talking it up forever while dinner rush hits at full speed. So it's ok for your employees to pick up the slack for bad lazy management who stand around  while we pay towards their salaries? Also  our whole meal took less than a half hour. I didn't go out to eat to basically be thrown food  an expensive bill  and hasty goodbye. So frustrating and regretful I chose to eat here last night.
Oscar M.,North Natomas  Sacramento  CA,0,3,,11/24/2017,5.0,Great friendly staff... had a great time thanksss for the awesome food and service.i would definitely recommend this location to family and friends
Caroline N.,San Jose  CA,0,41,,11/18/2017,4.0,Great place to grab happy hour items! The atmosphere is very good although the service could be better.
Jatin M.,Sacramento  CA,50,143,5,7/5/2017,4.0,Out of the numerous times I have been to other BJ's locations in Sacramento area (Natomas and Roseville to be specifc)  I have never gotten better service than what I got yesterday at this location. I had a BOGO coupon and our sever was very helpful and accommodating. We didn't like one of our drinks and he gladly changed it for us. Didn't charge me for substituting toppings on my pizza. Thanks to my server  I had a great dining experience at BJ's at last!
Jess H.,Redding  CA,0,4,2,5/29/2017,1.0,"I typically love BJ\'s ever since I started working at the Arden Mall. It\'s my favorite place to go with my kids  whenever we have family in town or when I want an ice cold Blonde. I normally have great service from Mike or Athena up in the bar. My 30th birthday was this passed weekend of course I chose to have my birthday dinner there. I called on May 19th to see if they could accommodate a reservation of 20 at 7pm. The girl called me back and said her manager was able to do so. When we arrived on the 27th at 7pm the hostess said they had no reservation. After explaining to her the situation she got her manager. The manager was extremely rude  pretty much called me a liar. He stated they had no reservation for us and that they would have never made a reservation on a Saturday night for 20 people. I then pulled up my call log and showed him where I called and received a call back. I also googled their location number to assure I called the correct location. If I were him I would be scrubbing my previous schedule to see who was working during the time I called. He then said we could wait to see if they had any tables or we could go somewhere else. He was very concerned on how many of my party was actually there and ready to be sat if they could accommodate us. We had 14 currently there. He took me to the section where he was going to seat us to see if it was okay. It was going to be an end booth and a long table at the end of booth. This seemed like it would okay. When the two hostesses sat us we were sat in two booths that were separated  7 people in each  however  our reservation was for 20. Another group  in a booth was in between us. We were all very confused as this isn\'t what the manager had just shown me. The first hostess tossed the menus on the table before anyone even sat down. And instead of asking anyone to be seated she said ""I don\'t know why you all are staring at me!"" The other hostess kept insisting that this was all they could do and this where her boss told her to seat us. Meanwhile the middle of the section where we were going to be sat had three long tables that were unattended. The hostess said we could not sit there because it was for a reservation of 30 at 8pm. Wait a minute....I thought you don\'t make reservations like that?!?! I said ""this is ridiculous  I\'ve never had such horrible service  we\'re just going to leave!"" The hostess kept saying  ""that\'s fine you can leave!"" I replied that she could shut up at anytime As she had a horrible attitude since we walked in and acted like we were an inconvenience to her. She was standing there not inviting us to sit or seeing if there was a possible better solution. Did I mention they were not busy and there was no one else on the wait list. The tables weren\'t together  they would have never accommodated a party of 20 in the two booths  and they let a regular walk out of their establishment unsatisfied. The bottom line is we were there and whether we had a reservation or not they should have sat us together. The manager didn\'t even try to approach us again on the way out. I will never go back because of this horrible service. We instead went back to my house and ordered Mountain Mikes and it ended up being a much better choice."
Alex L.,Sacramento  CA,4911,1532,3367,4/21/2016,3.0,The hostesses are always overwhelmed and the noise level is always peaking the decibel meter. If you're lucky  as we were this night  you'll get a decent waitress who keeps your drinks refreshed  has good hearing and returns often. Considering all the negatives  there is still a reason people keep coming back. In my opinion  it's a fantastic in-house brew selection and some pretty decent food. Weigh the positives and negatives when you decide whether to eat here.
Kory R.,Fairfield  CA,311,342,1002,5/2/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I stopped in on Sunday and got the Ahi Tuba Salad and BF got the Mahi Mahi and Shrimp. Service was wonderful  food was delicious UNTIL a few hours later when food poisoning symptoms hit me.. We figured out where it came from because BF didn't eat any of my salad and we ate our normal food prior to BJ's.. I will never be returning to this establishment again.**UPDATE** My doctor recommended that I call this establishment and let them know about what it happened. I spoke to the manager Carla who was very sympathetic and caring. She offered us a full refund of our meal via a gift card and advised that she would let HR know as well. Kudos to them for doing this as they could have looked the other way. We won't be returning to this BJ's but we will try a different location.
John W.,Sacramento  CA,0,7,,10/10/2017,4.0,My wife and kid and I went for dinner on a Saturday. They do not make reservations so we called ahead of time and I was told we could be put on the weighting list which supposedly would make our wait in line shorter. It didn't make any difference we were told would be 10 was closer to 30 minutes. The food and service was great. The only bad thing was they only gave me about  cup of mashed potatoes very skimpy.John w Sacramento CA
Wissali R.,Salt Lake City  UT,157,1,,9/20/2017,3.0,You have to wait in line forever to be seated. Food is great. The desserts are great! Just have to have to wait for so long to be seated
Carnage V.,Fresno  CA,0,4,10,11/12/2016,1.0,Me and my buddy went to bj November 12 2016 Great customer service but food is horrible we order boneless BBQ wings for a appetizer and calamari eat about 3 wings and on the fourth one was not cooked all the way then my spaghetti and meatball came out and the meat balls where not cooked all the way my buddy got a ribi and it was mostly fat and no meat it's safe to say that the only thing that was good was the water and the server that we had I feel bad for her that there is just shit ass cooks that can not make food correctly they need new cooks end result I ended up in the restroom puking my guts out will never recommend this place nor come back to this place
Melissa Q.,Vacaville  CA,4,12,1,9/18/2017,5.0,Our waiter Adam is awesome  he brought JT a bowl of fruit and bread right away to calm him down.
Alix V.,El Dorado Hills  CA,7,30,1,8/7/2017,1.0,Worst service I've ever received in my life's the food has been horrible both times I've come here. Servers seem like they can't be bothered to help you. I'll happily drive 20 minutes up to the Folsom location. You couldn't pay me to come back here.
phyllis n.,Elk Grove  CA,1,37,,11/11/2017,5.0,We have been to this restaurant dozens and dozens of times. The service today was outstanding all thanks to Angela T. She was crazy busy but still had time to not only make us feel welcome but to chat with us. Rarely  do you meet someone who within five minutes of meeting them that you realize they are beyond special. Thank you Angela for making our Veterans' Day memorable!
Nate C.,Fremont  CA,15,13,1,8/7/2017,5.0,Great service from Chad in the cocktail area. Only had to ask for everything one time and he was as friendly and as fast as it gets. The other cocktail staff could use some lessons lol. Great meal though thanks!
Joe M.,Woodland  CA,67,140,279,10/30/2016,4.0,Solid bj joint. Kinda the same as the natomas location. It can get packed but I've seen that with the other location as well. Service for me has been pretty good for all my visits. Unlike the other location  this one has a revolving door in front. If your done shopping and don't want food court  come swing by for some bj food
Jim R.,Sacramento  CA,432,44,21,9/19/2017,4.0,Very good food. The service is very nice. The staff accompanied our wishes to turn down the loud music. They also adjusted the thermostat because it was too cold. Very pleasant atmosphere. A large selection of entrees. Gluten free entrees
D B.,Mather  CA,0,7,,11/9/2017,5.0,The ahi poke  at this BJ's specifically  is the BEST!! It's my favorite item to have there  though so much of their food is good  and every time I go to this restaurant I have it. You would think it would be the same at every BJ's but by FAR the quality of the ahi at this location beats any other. It is never marbled and always fresh. Thank you for taking this dish seriously and for being so consistently fantastic!!!
Carlos M.,Sacramento  CA,0,4,2,6/17/2017,5.0,First experience at a BJ's. Very satisfying. Good food and great service! It's noisy but it has a bar  so you would expect that. Nonetheless  great experience. Would recommend!
William L.,Sacramento  CA,1735,1232,9199,1/6/2016,3.0,"After coming to the Elk Grove  Natomas  and the Roseville locations  I decided to pay a visit to this national restaurant chain called  ""BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse"" at Arden Way. I usually come to that place for quite some times  and I\'m likely satisfied for this effort! Located outside Arden Fair Mall  BJ\'s has it all delivering their wonderful entrees  appetizers  drinks  and desserts to enjoy dining pleasures. The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most BJ\'s does. However  this place is quite smaller here despite the location which it attached to the mall  yet it does have some good  average space to dine in and heading to the bar side too.The employees are doing a good job here despite the environment of how busy it is. I\'m sure they need to re-improved the customer service easier to make this place more reliable and motivated.Now onto the food! On 7/1/2015  I decided to ordered a happy hour appetizer meal: the chicken pot stickers and a glass of BJ\'s Blonde Ale. So far  the pot stickers tasted very good! The dippable sauce for the pot stickers did work the flavors too. The BJ\'s Blonde also tasted not bad at all for this light beer! Very crisp and bold for that ale!The next visit  on 1/5/2016  my father and I were visiting to the same place for an another try by redeeming their ""Buy One  Get One (BOGO) Free"" promotion offer during the lunch peek hours. We decided to ordered a Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl and a Lemon Thyme Chicken. As we ate it  the food is simply not bad. The Salmon Quinoa tasted good which it makes the seasoning very balanced. The Lemon Thyme Chicken is also tasted delicious too although it did add some salt a little bit as I continued to eat. I wish this plate needs to reduced the sodium content next time. Otherwise  it\'s a good  fine meal for lunch!There\'s tons of parking spaces available right outside Arden Fair Mall  so you can park anywhere you want near or far.All in all  BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse at Arden Way is a good national restaurant chain that I really enjoyed dining here. I\'ll come back for more to try their incredible food and drinks every season! A worthy visit! My rating: 3 1/2 stars."
S. W.,Sacramento  CA,3,67,33,3/28/2017,4.0,Great drinks  great food  great waiter  and prompt service too. I had the charbroiled salmon and my friend had the balsamic chicken and they were both VERY good. I love the mashed potatoes that my friend had and kept reaching into his plate to get more. The lemon pepper wings are really good as well and cooked to perfection. I had a strawberry margarita and the waiter heard me tell my friend to get his with sugar so he put sugar on mine too  great service. Our food came out VERY fast and we didn't have to wait for anything!!!! I can't wait to go back  I even signed up for their premier rewards!!
Trina R.,Fremont  CA,222,160,465,1/4/2016,2.0,First time ever for this location with a friend. My friend and I sat by the bar. Not the best place to sit at because 1. we felt neglected from our waiter  he only saw us 3 times. My friend had to flag down a different waitress. We ordered 2 drinks. I forgot what my friend ordered but it had to with peach and I ordered the Royal soda Cream soda drink. I am sorry I forgot the name of the drinks we ordered but I remember both drinks were strong. That's when we tried to flag down our waiter to bring us water and cream soda for it to help with how strong our drink was. It took quite awhile for him to come around but instead he never did so therefore that's when we had to flag down the waitress  haha. It's just disappointing to neglect your customers): We also ordered chips and spinach artichoke dip which was good! The calamari we ordered wasn't crispy at all  it was on the soft side but we are still thankful :) it was just a different texture in our mouth. The pizookie we ordered was cookies n Creme! Wawow! So yummy  that's my favorite flavor of pizookie from BJ's. I would definitely come back to dine in for the pizookies and their buffalo wings; their buffalo wings are good too.
Karen K.,Crystal City  Arlington  VA,23,7,5,8/29/2017,4.0,Yummy cheese dip with chips.I had the personal tomato and cheese pizza ... crust was a little thick. I also had the cucumber and mint water refreshing on a sizzling day!
Ryah B.,West Sacramento  CA,137,58,1,2/14/2017,1.0,"Picked up to-go and told the staff I would be sitting and waiting in the lobby. They said 20 minutes  so then 35 minutes goes by and i finally ask someone and they said it\'s been sitting in their warmer. I check on the food and it\'s no longer hot. $53 of food that is barely warm? Explained the situation to the manager and she said ""I can heat it up for you."" Mmm overcooked pizza and appetizers...? Hahaha. Thanks! Zero stars if I could."
Cheryl G.,Sacramento  CA,139,140,28,1/29/2017,5.0,My new mission in life is to get Logan promoted from to go to server/server trainer. Or anything above that.After the horrible to go experience I had last month I was absolutely pissed off with this place. But with me having to work late & it being 1130 at night his attentiveness & cheery attitude was worth it. I deal with a lot of businesses & he is one of the best. And he's not a server yet! And he beats most of the the other ones during a slow business day. He actually cares about his work. So once he gets promoted ask for him. I'll make sure his section stays busy & full.
Cindy W.,Natomas  Sacramento  CA,289,185,689,1/26/2016,4.0,This Bjs is usually busy because it is located right in the Arden Fair Mall. They are open until midnight. Our friends wanted to stop by the bar for some drinks. The bar area was self seating. The service was a bit slow. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza  guacamole with chips and calamari. The appetizer came out quick. The food is always delicious there. The pizza was good with the drinks.
Liana B.,Sacramento  CA,226,250,904,11/17/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Came here for a quick lunch on a Monday. My friend and I sat at the bar and were greeted immediately. Bj's has good lunch specials! We both had the unlimited soup and salad. You can order any soup and salad at any given time with this deal. I had a bowl of their clam chowder  which was way too salty  and two of their Caesar salads  which was delicious! The greens tasted fresh  there was an abundance of Parmesan cheese  and the croutons were crunchy and well seasoned. I haven't been this excited about a Caesar salad in a long time lol. My friend had the chicken tortilla soup and the tomato and mozzarella salad. She said the soup was lukewarm  but the salad was good. Service was quick and efficient  and we were in and out! I would definitely come back for their lunch specials.

CB R.,Fair Oaks  CA,0,11,,4/19/2017,4.0,We were seated very quickly on Easter Sunday when many restaurants had long waits if they had any seats at all  so that was very nice. All of the front-of-house staff were very friendly and accommodating  quickly swapping out a high chair for a booster seat  and keeping all of the glasses full.Everyone in our party expressed that their entrees turned out perfectly  and our starter was equally good and we went through it quickly. My rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly to medium-rare and the roasted asparagus and brussel sprouts will change your mind if you didn't already enjoy these vegs.I'm off desserts currently but the selections  like the rest of the menu  is extensive and you can always find something to match your mood or current cravings. BJ's is always a great go-to when your party can't all decide on any place else!
West HR Kevin A.,Sacramento  CA,5,8,,4/15/2017,4.0,the best restaurant to enjoy all kinds of dessert such as food and the sacramento .Sometimes you need to wait but you have a good reason to be happy with the service and food
Jennifer M.,Sacramento  CA,134,134,594,11/8/2015,5.0,5 ***Star***burger alert! Dam.....I knew I was going to be happy to get one of these first class burgers in my mouth! My tastebuds and I are very happy we went with the classic burger with guac and french fried onions! Mmm....mmmmm....m! I am already plotting my next conquer for B.J's. So on to the shoestring fries....whoo hoo says my belly... Crisp  tasty and well seasoned! Ketchup was not even necessary for this splendid treat. The other option was thick wedged seasoned fries- I am confident either choice would not disappoint!*The expected wait was 25 minutes...we were seated in 5....server was uber attentive  our drinks were always full and no hard sales on apps or beverages. This was a great dining experience!
Ricky M.,Sacramento  CA,73,120,453,11/8/2015,5.0,The burgers are off the chain. The skinny fries were delicious. Even the ice tea stayed filled up the whole time. The waitress was there at every turn. Even though it was super busy. I think this is my first five star review. Even when we first walked in the hostess told us a 20 minute wait. 5 minutes at the most. We will be back for sure.
Shavonne T.,Sacramento  CA,0,15,10,6/8/2017,1.0,My fianc and I have ate here twice. Each time the customer service was horrible. I asked for no onions and I got a cold burger loaded with onions. We had to ask for silverware and refills on our drinks. I did speak with the manager about my burger and he offered to get me a fresh one and to take it off of the tab. That was the only good thing about our experience 
Charlie J.,Sacramento  CA,0,31,4,7/22/2017,5.0,Had the  I think it was called  the midnight special burger. With Chile verde and a fried egg. Omg soo good. Loved the food  scenery  and service!!
Ezekiel Highwind ..,Elk Grove  CA,0,2,,2/26/2017,1.0,Do yourself a favor and dont make reservations here i was guaranteed a call ahead reservation and when I got there they gave it away to a another party and I was early in arriving to my reserved time. I found it unprofessional! I ate at this location before and there service was great but Im giving them the 1 star for the lack of communication for making reservations
Elijah G.,Valley Oak  Stockton  CA,99,1,1,7/27/2017,1.0,Bad service  the waitress was bad. They brought out our food and took longer then we expected. They were rude and disrespectful. Especially the lady at the front desk. Overall really bad service. I won't be returning
Demi D.,Central Sacramento  Sacramento  CA,1,4,,7/27/2017,4.0,When I come here I always go straight to the bar to order and get drinks fast. the food is better than the bjs in natomas and elk grove.
Douglas J.,Rio Linda  CA,0,3,1,11/7/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I went to this restaurant on Tuesday Nov 1 2016. My experience was terrible. The hostess was rude & had zero personality. She seemed upset that I asked for a table instead of a booth. She told me the wait would be 10 minutes. After almost 25 minutes of waiting and seeing people who came after myself & my dinner guest get seated before us. I asked her if she had forgotten us. She said we had to wait because we requested a table. When we finally got seated the waitress came after several minutes and took our order. It wasn't unusually busy & I noticed several empty tables. I ordered a bacon burger & with BBQ sauce on the side & a dinner salad. The salad came with out an issue. A gentleman (not our waitress) brought our entrees to the table. I noticed immediately that my burger was brought to me without the French fries that should have accompanied it. The gentleman said that they noticed I had an onion allergy. They informed me that they fry their French fries in the same oil as their onion rings and were concerned for my allergy. I appreciated that but asked him why they didn't ask me sooner? Why not ask me before they cooked my burger. I informed him that I wouldn't have an issue with the fries & he went back to the kitchen to have them made. So there I sat with my burger without the BBQ sauce I had requested. I waited for our waitress so I could get the BBQ sauce  but she didn't come. My friend began to eat because I didn't want his food to get cold like my burger was becoming! When our waitress finally brought the BBQ sauce along with my fries I discovered my fries were STONE COLD!!! Very upsetting. They offered to re cook my food  but my friend was almost done eating! They offered to bring me dessert. Why would I want dessert when I haven't eaten dinner. I payed for my salad & my friends meal. We left! I was hungry & very much disappointed in my experience. I doubt I'll ever go to a BJ's restaurant again!!!!!Sincerely Douglas
Jimmy Z.,Sandy  OR,1,4,,3/10/2017,5.0,Absolutely the best. My friend and I decided to grab something to eat and decided on BJ's. Not only were the staff friendly but the food came out fast and was delicious. She ordered their Caesar salad with dressing on the side and I ordered the flatbread pizza. (Watching my carbs  however the beer didn't help.)I would definitely come here again. Highly Recommended!
Gretchen Q.,Milpitas  CA,180,193,24,4/9/2016,2.0,I like the food  albeit a bit salty (basically everything on their menu). I love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. This appetizer came out pretty fast. Also yummy! I usually order the Spinach stuffed mushrooms. Their mushrooms used to be soooo big  but now it's small-sized mushrooms. It was also pretty salty compared to the last time I had it.Clam chowder was also very salty. My chicken lettuce wraps weren't that bad. It was a little salty but the lettuce balanced the flavor out. The chicken was good too.The only thing that wasn't salty was the Strawberry Lemonade hah. We surprisingly had a great service from our last visit.
Faith R.,Carmichael  CA,13,22,13,5/22/2017,5.0,Excellent place for dinner and awesome service. The server was helpful in assisting me in my entre. I had the ribs and they were great.
Mindy F.,Sacramento  CA,116,23,13,7/19/2017,5.0,Went for lunch and enjoyed the bottomless soup and salad. The caprese salad is amazing. We got the portabella burger  sub patty for extra bella. Delicious  enjoyed a $4 brew on the Wednesday special. Would have ended with a pizookie  but we were stuffed. Adam was a fabulous server.
an l.,San Jose  CA,86,185,281,10/25/2016,3.0,"Dropped in for lunch as it was a convenient location in the mall. I really wanted to eat at the Nordstrom cafe(my fave) but it was prime time lunch hour and the wait was a bit long. After spending all my money on shoes and clothes I didn\'t need  I got hungry and to my surprise  absolutely no wait at BJs. Since it was raining  I wanted the chicken tortilla soup. Being that I was also running errands all day  I figured I also needed some carbs in me so I ordered a lunch size California flatbread pizza. My friend ordered the half California club sandwich and the tortilla soup also. I wasn\'t impressed but the size of his ""lunch size"" California club. The menu said half of the regular size... he got one wedge. He also asked for wedge fries and got shoe string fries. The server that brought our food out dropped it and left  so we couldn\'t tell her the fries were wrong. Our waitress never checked on us either so we just ate what we had. The chicken tortilla soup didn\'t taste as good as the BJs in Elk Grove. This one was a lot thicker and one small cube of avocado.The server never came to check on us... only when we asked for the bill. Considering more than half the tables were empty at the bar where we sat  I would expect better service. I\'m going to stick with Nordstrom cafe next time for better service."
Fabian Z.,Sacramento  CA,0,18,,7/17/2017,2.0,Our service was super slow even though it was not even a busy hour of day business wise. Everyone in my group had an issue with thier order. My pizza was burnt and Arnold palmer was terrible. If you really want bjs  I suggest going to the natomas location.
Patrick H.,Sacramento  CA,38,16,6,2/24/2017,4.0,Bj's is one of my go 2's for sure  always satisfied when i leave. Great place to bring my kids everyone loves those darn bazookies. I try and make sure and call ahead so i dont have to wait to be seated they can get pretty busy.
Ina S.,Sacramento  CA,2,174,2,5/11/2017,5.0,Great baby back ribs  two sides a salad and a pizookie  my new place for this wonderful meal deal on Thursday's  service was fantastic : D
Marcella S.,West Sacramento  CA,0,28,11,7/1/2017,5.0,Amazing staff! I left my bank card by mistake obviously! The staff kept my card  it was not used. I have lost my card before and woke up to nothing left in my account except overdraft fees. So you have no idea how appreciative I was! On our visit we had a waitress training and her trainer was amazing! The food was delicious as usual ! Thank you for having an amazing and honest staff!
Zaira R.,Sacramento  CA,130,41,35,12/12/2016,3.0,I have been to this location several times since it opened. Each and every time I would say the service and food has been good but not great. There is usually a pretty long wait time. It's a good idea to try to call ahead or to plan on waiting for at least 20 minutes. It is a very convenient location  especially when you don't feel like eating junk at the mall. Last night I ordered the spicy chicken soba noodles and they were actually really good. The only downside was the portion they served me was so small that I was still hungry after (which usually never happens). My husband ordered the sirloin steak and said that he has had much better steak at other restaurants and he would not say it was worth the money. Overall  it is a comfortable and good dining experience.
A N.,Sacramento  CA,3,3,,7/16/2017,3.0,This review is solely based on the Churro Pizookie--- NOT that good. It seemed as if they deep fried 50 churros together and they were just all in the back waiting to come out. They were not fresh at all. At least the other Pizookies are baked to order..
Pam C.,Sacramento  CA,0,20,11,9/13/2017,1.0,I don't know whats been going on with BJ's the lately but quality of food is poor. It seems to have been like that this past year. It used to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite but not so much anymore. When someone suggests to go to BJ's I suggest something else. Their food comes out cold and or over greasy. Gross.
Alex F.,Santa Rosa  CA,40,5,,9/24/2017,1.0,If I could leave no stars I would  me and my girlfriends family five of us to be exact when into this restaurant at 5:30 to ask about how long it would be get a table they told us that it would be 30 minutes so we asked if by six will be seated they said yes. Well 6 o'clock comes and goes and we go ask them if our table is going to be ready soon and they say that now it's gonna be another 45 minute wait because there's a table that will not leave meanwhile there's other five tops that are coming in and walking right past us getting to be seated and I understand they're busy but if they say that you cannot call before hand and make reservations  why are we been put to the side and not even being talked too?. Worst customer service I've ever experienced here nobody knew what they were doing even the manager came up and she had no idea how to try and resolve the issue. We finally decided to just leave after waiting for over an hour. Not acceptable at all. And this is the worse bjs I've ever been
Rana S.,Sacramento  CA,0,6,2,9/17/2017,5.0,We had really good time there. Everything was perfect  cool. We went there 2 days ago. And they get us our table. Sofi the girl with charm  took order and served and treated awesome. She were like super friendly. And i love the food. I ask Sofi that who is cooking my food and that was Davin And Nash cooking for us that time. We loved that place and people there. Hopefully we going there next week too. Thank you guys for real good time
Darci K.,Sacramento  CA,712,256,2908,4/21/2015,3.0,If you're going to do happy hour  have the mini pizza. It's worth the $6.00 you can choose any of the pizza toppings you want ! The other 'tizers are sparse and not meant to fill a toddlers tummy. The wait staff wasn't overly happy. Hence the three stars  and the avocado egg rolls tasted like regurgitated food.
June M.,Murphys  CA,0,3,,6/30/2017,4.0,We had a great server  Andy. He was patient  kind and had great communication skills! We really appreciated his help as we indecisively navigated the menu! The food was good  service was great and the bathrooms were clean!
Josh M.,North Sacramento  Sacramento  CA,17,1,,9/19/2017,1.0,Normally I 've had good experiences with BJ's but this was my first time visiting this location at Arden mall. I called at noon to make reservations for 12 people for today 9/19 at 7pm. The lady I spoke to confirmed 3 times with me the time  # of people  and the day  I thought it a little extreme but hey it'll avoid mistakes. She then said she needed to run it by her manager and placed me on a 3 minute hold. Afterwards she said all was approved and then confirmed the time 7pm  the # of people 12  and the day today 9/19.... We did this 7 more times..... No exaggeration. We added 5 more people with prior approval. We have 16 of the 17 people there at 7 and the front counter says the reservation was set for 7:30. They had us wait for patrons to finish their meals  pay their bill and then they relaxed and visited. That was completely expected and in no way their fault for BJ's mistake. We left and now enjoying our meals at Olive Garden. Thank you Olive Garden!
Jackie B.,Elk Grove  CA,1,49,12,9/21/2016,2.0,This is one of the worst BJ's in Sacramento. Every time I go here something doesn't go right. Just recently I had gone for dinner and our server said she would add the points onto my bj account. -____- definitely did not get those points. Food comes out total hit or miss and I am the type of person if I am super hungry I will eat it because anything else would take that much longer.I'm always disappointed in this location. Really need to step their game up. I mean what's the point in having a rewards club if you never even ask me before brining the check.Literally gave this place a 2 star because I've never had a problem with their beers.
Kathy K.,Sacramento  CA,0,5,,9/16/2017,3.0,I got take out last night their spaghetti and meatballs lit was way to spicy. Almost every bite had a chili flake. I don't believe spaghetti and meatballs are supposed to be spicy. I could not eat it all. My husband had the shrimp and Mahi Mahi which he loved.
Mel K.,Sacramento  CA,5,36,14,3/2/2017,1.0,2 hours. This is the longest I've ever spent at BJ's or any restaurant for that matter. 6:15pm we arrived. 6:30- seated. 6:35- drinks and appetizers ordered. Server didn't come take our order until 7:30. I couldn't be mad at him  because he apologized for making us wait. Food didn't come out until 8:00. Took us mins of picking at our semi warm food to realize we had filled up on water or root beer. It took the server another 10-15 mins to come around before I could ask for the check and some to go boxes. Andddd then... we were freeeeee.
Carol P.,Sacramento  CA,3044,820,871,1/30/2015,4.0,"Cherry chipotle glazed salmon from the ""enlightened"" menu. Soooo good. Soooo flavorful. Soooo going to order it again. Not enough o\'s to describe just how surprisingly delicious it really was. WIth just a hint of sweetness  this savory glaze was perfect for my thick cut of salmon. It was maybe baked a wee bit too long  as the fillet itself was flaky but not tender. It was served over some really flavorful quinoa with spinach and side of the skinniest asparagus spears I\'ve ever seen in my life. It didn\'t matter. The flavor was there.I called in this order for takeout  and when I arrived 20 minutes later (ETD-estimated time of doneness-given to me by staff taking order) to the restaurant  I waited a few minutes for the takeout counter staff and another few minutes to get my order. No worries because my food was still hot when I got back home. Of course  presentation of the dish was lost from being jostled in the plastic foldover container during transportation. But again  no worries  it\'s a fabulous dish. Hope this stays on the menu!"
Chris S.,Arlington  VA,246,601,350,8/12/2016,2.0,Great selection of draft beers. But  the place is really packed and service is slow. Seeing how packed it was in the bar area  I was surprised to see two children sitting at the bar. Not at tables in the bar area  but literally sitting at the bar. I did not think this was legal in California.
Esther S.,Kapolei  HI,56,57,99,3/8/2016,5.0,This review is long overdue. I called to make a reservation for party of 30 a month in advance. I spoke with Olivia and she was great. Very friendly and professional. She gave me the names of the 2 managers and confirmed everything. She even got approval for our party to have the happy hour prices which was very cool. When we arrived our table was ready. They had a good variety of pizza and beer. I feel really bad for taking so long to write this review because I'm not certain the name of our waitress. I believe it was Johanna...but could be mistaken. She was awesome. She had a very calm demeanor and did a wonderful job as our waitress. It's not easy serving a big party. Having a big family  we often eat out with a party of 15 and often times you can see and sense the frustration of waiters/waitresses when asking for things. But not once did she seem overwhelmed  which I'm sure she may have very well been. She always had a smile and checked often if we needed anything. Her service was greatly appreciated.Overall  had a great experience with this restaurant and location. So thank you to everyone who made it a success. And we will definitely return whenever we're in town.
Craig J. T.,Rancho Cordova  CA,5,42,9,9/11/2016,2.0,Where's the toppings!!!! Just went in to eat some gluten free pizza. Ordered the ham and pineapple as toppings  I got my pizza and it had almost no toppings on it. BJ's what has happened to you???
Jenna S.,Valley Springs  CA,5,40,75,8/9/2016,4.0,The pepperoni pizza and pazookie desserts are super delish. The servers were fast  efficient and knowledgable. Great ambiance  very cozy and warm. The neighborhood is great because it's right by a high end mall. My only problem is the price.. Some things are reasonable  but others are a smidge overpriced. All in all I would for sure recommend going  I am for sure:)
Ross H.,Sonora  CA,106,31,12,3/7/2017,1.0,We put in our name at 6:45p the Place was busy but not that busy.....took an hour to get seated so we ordered appetizers  they brought our entres prior to the appetizers. They took some of the entres back and then brought the appetizers and then brought the entres back again. Two hours at the table everybody is finely eating...... seriously?!?!?
Sarah M.,North Highlands  CA,17,14,3,10/28/2016,5.0,Omg all I have is love for BJ'S of Arden tonight. Super happy with the service. There was a glitch with the order system. The manager went out of his way to make sure our order was out on time. The waitess was super awesome too. I got everything I asked for and then some. It was like they were reading my mind. I would be about to ask for something and here she would come with it in hand. Again thank you guys for a awsome meal that I didn't have to cook. Super happy customer here.
Franko G.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,5/30/2017,5.0,It's been a while since I had a great service and Andy did a outstanding job and the food was delicious
Dee D.,Sacramento  CA,16,152,762,2/27/2017,4.0,We hardly ever eat here  but occasionally we will get a pizza to go! Their deep dish is really tasty. Currently  they have a special on Mondays - half off large pizzas! Can't go wrong with that! The Mediterranean (without the chicken to make it veg) is my favorite! Sometimes we'll splurge and get a pizookie - Sooooo good!
Brittany G.,Sacramento  CA,17,24,29,10/8/2016,4.0,The four stars is for the care taking after my order. Ordered deep dish pizza on my lunch. Took about twenty minutes via the online site. Arrived to friendly staff and quick check out but went back to work to eat and my pizza looked like they just threw it together. Dont get me wrong I'm not expecting the pictures on the menu but this was not acceptable. Came back later after my shift showed the night manager Shawn a picture I took of the pizza and he agreed. Asked me if I wanted a drink while I wait for them to make me a new one. I give credit where its do and their customer service deserves credit. I didn't have to give some sob story or suggest anything. His first response was do you have time I want to get you a new one. This place is always busy but I'm even on a busy night they are ensuring standards are being kept. I wish it was done the first time but sometimes its the way you finish.
Kristel V.,Sacramento  CA,185,239,125,12/21/2015,4.0,Food and service here is pretty good. Ordered the Beet salad with my all time favorite avocado egg rolls. I believe in consistency and all the BJs I have been to in Sacramento are pretty consistent. Also tried the baked beignets which was very good! Not too sweet  but just right!
Danny R.,West Sacramento  CA,12,25,7,5/22/2017,5.0,I've never been disappointed at BJs. The food is always good and the service is friendly. Call ahead during the weekend so you can get a table quickly. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is my favorite. They also have a great kids menu. Some good brews too  I like the lightswitch Lager and the misses enjoys their berry burst cider.
Joanna S.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,1,5/21/2017,1.0,I just ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo to go and when I got home there was absolutely no sauce on the pasta. It was horrible and dry. Don't go to the bjs on Arden!!
Les C.,Folsom  CA,0,13,6,5/19/2017,4.0,"love bj""s love there menu  there food  never a long wait  mostly get right in. Great service and I love the rewards program. Free food  free pazooki. Can\'t get better than that"
Keely M.,Natomas  Sacramento  CA,228,174,426,1/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Today was not so bad! Happy hour during the football games half price mini pizza and $1 off drinks! I was really happy everything came out quickly and correct! Way to redeem yourself.
Abi C.,Gardner  KS,171,13,15,4/28/2017,3.0,Our party ordered three seared ahi salad & none came with avocado in them. When I prompted the waitress  she stated that there's no avocado in the entree. The menu clearly stated avocado  as well as the picture shown on the menu--avocado cubes all over the salad. We waited for the waitress to bring us a side of avocado...never happened. The waitress later offered us a mini dessert  limiting us to only one of the pizookie trio. I was not interested in it at all  but ended up getting it to go just to settle the disappointment.
Tonya S.,Dallas  TX,23,74,183,2/11/2017,3.0,We came in for the lunch menu   which we called ahead to verify. The waitress wanted to hurry and seat us because lunch was over at 3 . Our waiter comes and informs us there arent any lunch specials on weelend but the menu is still available. My daughter polite said may a speak to a manager. The hostess should be aware of what is happening in your establishment menu/specials/times. Long story short oir waitet said my daughter had some cool sun glasses on and he would ring us up at the lunch rate thanks BJ
Nate T.,Sacramento  CA,1,12,,5/15/2017,1.0,Patio is pet friendly but service is terrible. They have to find someone to wait on you. We gave this place a couple of chances. Never again. Patio dining sucks.
Jessica R.,Sacramento  CA,68,85,105,7/6/2016,4.0,My family and I visited BJs for lunch (Thursday) after shopping at Arden Fair for 2+ hours  there was a 10 minute wait and they sat us at a large booth. Beau was our server  he was kind/nice/polite/attentive  great smile. Avocado egg rolls were great as always. Sons grilled cheese was good with Fries. My salmon quinoa bowl was sooooo bland. Flavorless. My honey got a pasta and he enjoyed it.
Jason E.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,5/10/2017,4.0,Wednesday May 10  2017.Arrived at Bj's here on Arden and it was busy. Even though getting seated and ordering our 1st drinks was slow the staff on hand was extremely accomadating. Had 2 separate waiters. Both were friendly and made us feel important. Will be returning for future visits. Try the Berry Burst cider or the handcrafted draft cream soda. Nick was our main waiter.
Brenda R.,Dallas  TX,2,47,32,7/10/2016,4.0,Really casual environment. We got seated very fast here. Our waiter  Sean was extremely friendly and always showed a sense of urgency. I really recommend the the California Supreme Deep Dish Pizza.
Shannen C.,Sacramento  CA,264,463,3689,2/17/2016,4.0,Came here to order food to go. For a chain  the food is pretty good. The service is not bad either. They also have good happy hour. Will be back more.
Coleen M.,Sacramento  CA,67,61,5,3/25/2017,3.0,We went to BJ's and was pretty disappointed. We ordered an appetizer and it came out like 1 or 2 minutes before our meal. The appetizer was so hot we really couldn't eat it  then our meal showed up. Wow! So much for an appetizer  right? I ordered a beer and it came several minutes after my meal came. The food was good but they do not have table management or food delivery/cooking management at all. I would give them a 1 star for managing the flow of food/drink delivery. The food was flavorful and that's worth the 3 star review.
Eric F.,San Leandro  CA,735,2518,266,10/27/2015,4.0,"Been ages since my last BJ\'s visit and I\'m glad to find such a great branch right over at Arden Fair. Conveniently located  ample parking and even a nice outdoor patio area for warmer nights.My girlfriend and I tried a number of items including the turkey burger and several new dishes I hadn\'t seen before including brussies in sriracha cream sauce  stuffed mushrooms and sriracha dry-rubbed chicken wings. All the proteins were surprisingly tender with no semblance of overcooking or dryness. For drinks  I went with a red buffalo (50:50 mix of Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout) that turned out to be an awesome mix of creamy roastiness and hops.So while BJ\'s may be ""just a chain"" in the eyes of many  there\'s no doubt that the slew of new dishes is delivering in terms of flavor  texture and value especially during HH. For a relaxing date night or casual get together with friends  this branch is on my short list for sure!"
Sherg K.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,8/4/2017,2.0,Came in to this location 2 hours ago and I now just threw up my fish and chips. The fish tasted funny but I wasn't sure if it was their special batter or the fish. The tartar sauce tasted rancid too so I asked for ranch to make up for it which it did not. Only giving two stars because service was alright. Do not order seafood. My friends ordered chicken and a burger and they're okay.
Sokha L.,Sacramento  CA,26,4,,4/17/2017,1.0,Today is my birthday and right after the movies my husband brought me here for the first time to try it out. But the service sucks Kelly F. Was our server and we left our empty water cups and drink cups at the end of our table to see if anyone would ask to see if we would like a refill. Never will I go in again. That was my first time going in and will be my last time. The food was good. But service sucks. They stuck us all the way in the back and acted like they did not want to serve us. Never again!!! Is this how you train your servers to treat people like that. Unacceptable!!! The server did not stop by to see if everything was ok. We had to ask for our check.
Serina M.,Sacramento  CA,2,3,,3/23/2017,5.0,The food was great. The service was great. Tbh  my friends and I were drunk and indecisive when ordering our food. The waiter (wish I could remember his name) was super cool and patient. He even joked around with us a bit. Don't worry he got a good tip.
Dorthy R.,Sacramento  CA,156,14,53,12/15/2016,2.0,BJ's is just ok in my book. The quality of service has gone down since I've been going  this location is especially bad. I just take my food to go now. I do love the mobile app
Sandy M.,Citrus Heights  CA,33,123,7,2/18/2017,5.0,Had the lunch special which was a stuffed baked potato and a salad. It came out fast and it was delicious. Our waiter was very nice and did a great job making sure we were taken care of.
Susy L.,Sacramento  CA,0,34,250,3/6/2016,5.0,Bjz is always so good the bartenders are so amazing The lost lots of ppl Since the took the happy hour specials Too bad
Judy P.,Sacramento  CA,65,2,,4/4/2017,1.0,There clam chowder taste like it's straight out from a can  I did not like it and their steak is plain no type of flavor but charcoal. I wasn't satisfied at all.
Emily F.,Citrus Heights  CA,77,4,2,4/2/2017,5.0,This BJ's location is by far my favorite. We had a party of 10 for a birthday and our waiter Benjamin was super on top of it while helping other tables as well  and made time to make us feel important and laugh. Great food and good company. I have all good things to say. If you can  ask for Ben!
Amritpal W.,Riverside  CA,5,16,54,5/25/2016,1.0,I have tried this place before and this time was just as bad as last time. Last time we came the lettuce was in such bad shape like it was weeks old. This time the appetizer took about 45 mins and we got the Sriracha Queso Dips chili verde which I lie to you not had 3 spoons of fat oil in it. I don't know why but the service and quality of food at this location is usually the worst.
Marissa J.,Rancho Cordova  CA,149,25,21,6/7/2016,4.0,I have always enjoyed coming to BJs. I enjoy coming to this location in particular because it is located right next to Arden Fair Mall  which is incredibly convenient. However  it is significantly smaller than all of the other BJs locations I have been to  though the service is typically fast  so the smaller size does not affect the speed of service.I always love coming here when they have their 2 for $25 deal going on. For $25  you each get either a small house salad  Caesar salad  wedge salad (my personal favorite)  or any soup  plus any medium Deep Dish or Tavern-Cut pizza  and of course a Pizookie  which is what BJs is known for - their large oven-baked cookie topped with ice cream.I usually always get the Cookies 'n' Creme Pizookie  but they have a ton of flavors to choose from. If you're indecisive  you can get the Pizookie Trio  which is three mini Pizookies and you can mix and match the flavors. Another tip I've learned is that they can make a Pizookie half and half. In the past  I have ordered a Pizookie that was half Cookies 'n' Creme and half Chocolate Chunk.Overall  I enjoy eating at BJs and will definitely continue coming to this location.
John T.,Citrus Heights  CA,1,9,6,3/30/2017,4.0,Here's a picture of our Sacramento Vietnam Veterans group that meets once a month to hoist a pint and break bread in Brotherhood and friendship. We started our group back in September  2015. We enjoy lunch on the patio  only once eating inside during inclement weather  19 months now. Samantha (Sam)  our waitress has only missed one month of taking care of us with 5-star service. Good food  great service and the camaraderie of a dozen Brothers-in-Arms  today we celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War  toasting and saying a pray for our missing and suffering Brothers.
Vivian L.,Sacramento  CA,2,13,,6/18/2016,2.0,I usually go to the Elk Grove location  but decided to come to this location instead cause I was closer to it at the time. Went there last night. Ordered a strawberry mojito  and the spaghetti and meat balls dish. The food came out really quick  but tasted great  but as I was chewing  I bit on something small and hard. Took it out of my mouth  and it was a piece of cardboard! But I didn't make it a big deal about it cause I was happy that at least it wasn't human hair or a bug  so I continued eating. When I got home  I felt really sick. I thought it was the mojito kicking in  so I decided to go to sleep. The next morning(today) at 7am  I had horrible (sorry)diarrhea  and threw up ALL the spaghetti out. As of right now(12:13pm)  I'm still having to use the bathroom. I can honestly say that I got food poisoning. Sad  too  cause I love Bj's  but definitely won't be coming back to this location anymore.
Marcus M.,Folsom  CA,401,264,396,9/26/2015,2.0,I always get suckered into coming here! Overpriced beer and ok food! The service is always prompt tho! The best thing about BJ's are their pazookies! The food here is ok. Not bad but not good which is why I'm not a huge fan.
Amy H.,Sacramento  CA,0,6,,3/7/2017,1.0,Our lunch took over 45 minutes and most of us ordered soup and salad at the Natomas location in Sacramento  CATerrible service from the kitchen.
Kristin F.,Sacramento  CA,144,90,148,9/11/2015,5.0,I've been to this BJ's for a lot of meals  including last night for dinner! The staff is always very friendly here and the restaurant is clean. There's usually only 2 of us  so we never have to wait long to be seated. Last night  my boyfriend and I partook in the 2 for $25 deal. You get 2 salads (I got a wedge  him a house)  a medium deep dish pizza  and a pizzokie for $25! Great value! They even let you half and half the pizza  so I got the Spicy Hawaiin Chicken and he got the Extreme Pepperoni. Both were great! For dessert: an original Pizzokie. Fantastic  as always. This location also has a decent happy hour which extends to 7 instead of 5 or 6 like other places. They have good cheap eats and I recommend a $5.00 Strawberry Mohito to drink!
Bailey R.,Concord  CA,64,11,,7/31/2017,2.0,Last night came I'm for dinner with some friends. We were seated quickly but that's about all the positive news I have for this review. Our waters took at least 15 minutes to get to us. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip since we figured it would take awhile to get our food. When that came it tastes like cream of broccoli soup. Extremely thin  and while I do like cream of broccoli soup  it was pretty lame for spinach artichoke dip. Our main courses came. My rice was hard  chicken was overlooked and Brussels sprouts had too much balsamic vinaigrette.. they were purple. French fries I stole from my boyfriend were amazing. And my friends spicy peanut noodle thing was good too. So most of the food was good.. just not mine I guess. We ended the night with some pizzookies and they were great as always. Our waiter was polite and we knew he was busy so no bad things to say about him. Just the food and the wait for waters. All other food came fairly fast for how busy they were.
Joann P.,Sacramento  CA,479,369,2275,8/14/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Came here last night to meet up with some friends for dinner. Got there around 940pm and seated ourselves at the bar area. They have happy hour drinks starting at 10pm- close. Server was so slow. Took forever to get water and for her to get our order in. Food and drinks took forever to come out too. We actually thought our server went home that's how long it took. She messed up on our drinks. She brought out 2 glass of snake bite  when I only ordered 1 and got my friend's drink wrong. Other than the poor service I did enjoy my clam chowder. I ordered it in a sourdough bowl. It was very delicious.
Chaulzy S.,Sacramento  CA,50,78,75,8/24/2015,3.0,I pretty much frequent bjs for a regular cup of bowl of chicken tortilla soup or a jerry burst. You can usually walk right into the car section and sit faster than waiting for a regular table.This particular occasion I didn't feel well so I called in an order for curbside service. I specifically told the person ( who rudely rushed me off the phone) that I was ordering for curbside service. Her said ok just call when you get here and hung up..So I arrive and call.. Just for them to tell me they no longer do that service at this time of night. The sign says they do it until 9pm.! I called before 9 and was clear I required curbside. I even arrived before 9 and all. I didn't have the energy to argue so I get out and get it.... My food wasn't ready I stand there for 10mins waiting for someone to come back with my food literally holding back the urge to puke on their floor. I just wanted my soup and to get home but no. The person in the phone should have listened to me and not rushed me off the phone. They should have told me I would have to get out the car I could have had my bf be prepared to get out the car. Ugh I was so disappointed The soup is always good that's the only plus
Vivian L.,Fremont  CA,420,346,410,8/27/2014,2.0,Very nice ambiance inside  although lighting is way dimmer than it should be (I guess we're saving energy...). We ordered the crispy calamari  gourmet five meat pizza  and new orleans jambalaya. The crispy calamari was pretty good  thankfully the batter wasn't thickly applied. It tasted crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The pizza was a little too oily for my liking (and no  it's not because of all the meats). The meats and cheese also came right off the pizza bread  hence very messy to eat. The jambalaya tasted delicious at first  but a couple bites it got way too greasy. After this meal I started feeling nauseous 'cause of all the MSG and grease (I ended up having to eat soup-based foods for the next 2 meals).Service was decent  the waitress came and checked up on us several times. We did have to pack our own food to-go though  which is questionable considering BJs is a restaurant geared towards customer satisfaction.
Jasmine C.,Sacramento  CA,321,254,2983,9/3/2014,1.0,It was a weekday  has a work and school for tomorrow  so dinner to go  but it was a disaster  when the waitress took our order to go  she didn't ask what salad dressing that I want with my garden salad  she just decided by her self that I want ranch  same goes with our daughter kid meal chicken tenders no asking what is the sauce that she want.It's a weekday  and she isn't that busy too.And after we left  we were talking in the car if hubby check the bag that all our order were there and guess what  soup was missing  so we had to turn around for the soup :(
Mischa H.,Sacramento  CA,262,13,33,2/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Went to lunch with my husband and had a wonderful time the bar tender was great and the food was delicious!!
Matt A.,San Francisco  CA,5,3,1,1/23/2016,1.0,I love to eat and have rarely disliked anything but the food was so bad I had to share this. The waitress was extremely nice and helpful and service was great. But this review is for the steak and veggies that came with the meal. It was a ribeye (their best steak available) that I ordered medium but it came out well done  dark  chewy  fatty and one of the worst steaks I've ever had. The brussel sprouts were also extremely over cooked and I could barely look at them. I love BJs but they need to pay closer attention to my meat next time.
Alex L.,Oakland  CA,35,59,29,12/26/2016,3.0,It's always a hit or miss. Today I ordered a $9 soup and salad to go. The bartender was very nice and helpful but it took 20 minutes for it and when the waitress brought it there were no utensils so I had to wait longer for them to get it. I should have called in regardless.
Tabassum L.,Sacramento  CA,4,66,,6/8/2016,3.0,Last time I came here was last year as a late night thing with some friends. The menu is a little on the small side. The only thing good that I like here is the pizookie. Other then that it's not the kind of Restaurant that I crave.
Ben D.,Sacramento  CA,463,230,419,7/6/2015,4.0,Coco and I came over here after a nice family picnic earlier in the day to cool off. I must've down 6 glasses of water after feeling so drained by the heat. While Coco had a delicious BJ's root beer float. So since we'd already eaten we decided to split a dessert. She felt like chocolate so we ordered the triple chocolate plazookie! We've been to 4 other BJ locations so this is no different though I don't recall ever having such a rich decadently addictive dessert such as this. Only downfall is that's far too rich for her taste. It was well worth it though  this venue possessed the good ambiance of other BJ Brewhouses and also had a thoughtful staff serving with excellence. 4 stars to BJ's.
Josiah H.,Sacramento  CA,357,134,503,8/1/2015,4.0,I've been here too many times to count  but FINALLY I'm writing a review.Last weekend I took my boys to the BJ's at Arden for lunch last Saturday. I'd been to this location 1-2 other times  and always on the weekend. BJ's was filled as usual  with guests in the main areas as well as those in the bar section. Our wait for a table was only about 15 so while we waited  we watched the Giants game from one of the MANY TV's they had in the establishment that was showing it.Once we sat and were given our menus  and we got our drinks first. Then I noticed they were advertising their new appetizer  the 'Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts'. From the picture they looked grilled  so I decided to check them out. I also ordered their 16oz sirloin steak with grilled asparagus a small Cesar salad. My oldest son got the Brewhouse burger as he always does and my youngest got the chicken tenders and fries....like he always does! :)My salad arrived first which was a fairly decent size for a side salad....and then the Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts came. WOW! these were hands down  one of the best appetizers that I've ever had here. I went into ordering them not knowing what to expect  and I left wanting to find out how to make them (which I did). There were so many different tastes and smells going on in just this dish  there was a creamy  sweet and spiciness to the sauce because of the honey and Sriracha combination. Mixed in with a smokiness from the grilled outer layer of the Brussel Sprouts  plus a little bite from the Brussel Sprouts themselves. That plus the cesar salad was a good start to my main dish. The sirloin was cooked perfectly  and it paired well with the grilled asparagus.With the appetizer  and salad to start my meal off. I purposely saved half of my steak and asparagus for dinner  and so I could leave room for dessert. And I decided to have the 'BJ's Baked Beignet'  which was amazing. Imagine bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown  tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream  fresh strawberries  a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream.....yea exactly! You get this mixture of a warm cinnamon'y donut and cold creamy vanilla ice cream  topped with ripened strawberries in a sweet strawberry sauce!Overall it was one of the best pairings of meals that I've had at BJ's  which is saying a lot since I've probably eaten here at a minimum once a month. Over the last couple of years.
Anna S.,Roseville  CA,53,210,101,8/26/2015,4.0,BJ's is your typical large mass produced restaurant chain. The food is always hit or miss. Your service  same thing. You are always going to take a gamble of loving your food and service or hating it. Today we took the risk and we loved it. I am a rewards club member and every week or so they email me with special promotions. This week I received a buy one entree get one free. My fianc decided to redeem this coupon for lunch today. We had an awesome waiter who I wish we got his name. He was super friendly and very very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and when I asked for a side of ranch it came before our food! A lot of time they forget and you have to ask again  usually after you get your food. My fianc and I both got their new burgers. I got the portabella burger and my fianc got the guacamole burger. Both were delicious. The side of fries are so good. They are thin cut so very delicious. My portabella burger had a kick that I wasn't expecting but I liked it none the less. My only complaint was my burger was WAY over cooked. It was bad. I actually think my burger was microwaved because the inside was really really hot  not the cooked on a stove hot but microwaved hot. I should have said something but I didn't care enough to. My suggestion is to order your burger or mean medium. I'm sure it would have been much better. Overall I really enjoyed our lunch. They have a huge select of craft beer  mixed drinks and non alcoholic drinks. Their root beer is out of this world good. Oh and the pizookies are delish.
Raeann K.,Sacramento  CA,21,51,34,11/28/2015,5.0,Always a pleasure coming here. The staff is always super friendly and willing to help any way they can. The food is great  the drinks are great. My favorites are their burgers and salads. The pizza is really amazing too. Try their craft sodas  black cherry is super tasty. There's also a rewards membership you can afk them for  you earn points by eating there you can use towards free food and such.
Kristi T.,San Francisco  CA,439,353,1176,7/24/2014,4.0,We came in as a party of 8 on a Saturday night  after the California State Fair. Though it was pretty packed  we were seated immediately. I rounded BJ's down to a 4 since service was inattentive. It took too long for our server to take our orders  and he took both drink and food orders in one shot. At least give me my drink first! It was also nearly impossible to flag him down for my mocktail refill. Maybe service will be better when it's less crowded.I ordered a Peachberry Iced Tea (Mocktail). It was sweet and refreshing. Plus  free refills! For my entree  I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. It was absolutely delicious! The chicken breast is extremely tender and juicy. I was surprised it wasn't dry at all! Also  the balsamic glaze was perfect. It didn't overpower the seasoning on the chicken. The entree included a side of salad and a side of mashed potatoes. I finished half at the restaurant and took the other half home. It tasted good even after it was reheated. For dessert  I shared a Cookies 'N' Cream Pizookie with 3 other friends. 2/2 times that I've tried their pizookies and loved them! I would drop by just for a pizookie!Located in Arden Mall  there is no need to worry about parking. Props to them for opening late  which is why we came here! They need to handle their conflicts inside the kitchen or outside the restaurant. We witnessed one while we were there. Though entertaining  it's not the best for their reputation!
Tony S.,Laguna Beach  CA,0,39,19,2/17/2017,5.0,Always the best  food Quality Service and Clearness. I wish El Torito x the street can learn from these guys.
Parker K.,Sacramento  CA,177,43,48,5/8/2016,5.0,Even on a crowded day  with a 20 minute wait  we were seated promptly. The service was great and remembered our exact order for the three of us without writing anything down! My friend also got a free birthday cookie for his birthday! We'll definitely be back and I'd recommend this place to everyone!
Bobby G.,Sacramento  CA,0,3,,2/13/2017,1.0,First time me and my family came to BJ's  got seated extremely quick but we sat and stared around for 30 minutes and nobody seemed to have noticed. So we got tired of waiting and left and came to Cheesecake instead.
Lewis V.,Sacramento  CA,7,50,3,3/23/2016,5.0,One of my favorite lunch spots...BJ's is the perfect blend of fun atmosphere  good food and great service.Starting with the atmosphere  it is just fun. If you are a sports fan  there are TV's galore that will most likely be showing something that you are interested in. If you aren't into the sports showing  BJ's delivers a dim  very adult feeling dining area that is fun to get together with your friends and just have a good night out.The food is fantastic! The menu ranges the from build your own pizza section to delicious burgers  to fancier fare such as the pastas and steaks. Everything that I have tried  I have always been happy with. Although I do not drink  I would fail this review if I did mention the huge selection of various adult beverages. If you can't find something to drink here  you may be too hard to please.The final thing to mention is the service. I have always had great experiences when I visit. The host/hostesses at the front are always smiling and helpful  even when busy. The wait staff is very attentive and also always smiling. Your drinks rarely get to the bottom  and the food is delivered quickly. What else can you ask for?Overall  BJ's does not do anything half way. They really seem to want you to enjoy your experience. I will definitely return in the future.
Anthony S.,Carmichael  CA,2,42,2,1/8/2017,5.0,I never tried this place until my nephew wanted to go for his birthday  so I took him. The service was great. There was a wait  but we had a large party so I understand. They just texted us when the table was ready. We just walked the mall for 30 mins  then they called. The food was good and the price was right. No complaints here
Mimi I.,Citrus Heights  CA,4,16,,11/14/2016,5.0,we were there Sunday and our waiter was Shawn (might have misspelled it) he was fabulous!! we casual mentioned it was our mothers birthday to him and my brother wanted to pay for her meal and I would pay for mine separately. He was friendly and attentive! He had excellent customer service. He would mention a few times if the birthday girl needed anything else and if we all enjoyed everything and even brought her out a delicious Pazookie. I haven't had a great waiter in a long time who paid attention to little detail  thorough  friendly and made our experience pleasant. we got a seat and our food in a nice timely manner. Thank you so much for the best food and service
Angelina O.,Sacramento  CA,0,21,57,8/9/2016,5.0,Had such a Great evening at BJ'sHad calamari  me & Hubby shared a Deep dish of BJ's favorite(Supreme/Combination) & kiddo had kids Lemonade with Ice (Mac n cheese with...wait for it! (SMILEY) FRIES!! Oh! Never knew they even existed before tonight....We were definitely missing out! & 12pc for a Buck! What!!****Thanks to Ethan & Megan/Meghan for their Over the top Friendly Sevice!! Had a Pretty Awsome night!*Orabuena Family
Lauren S.,Sacramento  CA,123,18,2,1/17/2017,5.0,This is my go to spot after work to wind down. My favorite drink in the Jerry burst  it really hits the spot. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's always nice to see the kind and familiar faces smiling at me. The food is great  the drinks are tasty  and the staff is incredible. Cheers to the good times at Bj's Brewhouse.
Carla A.,West Sacramento  CA,0,19,4,6/16/2017,1.0,Horrible service from Christophe. Didn't refill our drinks and kept walking away from me when I asked for stuff. Must have been a bad day.
Kamala L.,Mendocino  CA,0,1,,1/30/2017,5.0,"(October 2016) Sharae G. was awesome! I ordered the Bison Burger ""burned"" to indicate that I wanted it very well done. It came medium. She happily took my burger back to the kitchen and her manager even came out to apologize. They brought me back a perfectly cooked burger  added extra crispy fries  and gave the burger to me for FREE! I am super impressed with this level of courtesy. Thank you Sharae!"
Jessica G.,Elk Grove  CA,23,1,,1/30/2017,5.0,Our server tonight was Theodore and he was awesome. He practically read our minds when he came and asked if we wanted the jeremiah red and hopstorm ipa and Avocado egg rolls. Bbq chicken pizza was delicious and monday nights large deep dish pizzas are half off so it was an amazing deal. :) Food was great and service was awesome. Will definitely be returning :)
Renee' R.,Sacramento  CA,14,4,1,6/20/2017,3.0,Going out to eat is a treat. Because I'm very busy and cooking isn't my favorite thing. I've visited BJ's in Arden Mall on several occasions but my last visit may be my LAST visit. Upon arrival they took our name and phone number and said they would call us when our table was ready  which should have been 15-20 minutes. We never received the call so we walked back to the desk and they said oh we can seat you now. We probably could've gotten seated earlier had we not walked out into the mall. The waitress approached us immediately after we were seated and took our orders. We were on a specific time frame and she said that would not be a problem. Fast forward 45 minutes when our food finally arrived at our table. The food was warm not hot. Therefore it had probably been sitting and she had not picked it up and brought it to us. We had approximately 10 minutes to eat cold food. There was plenty of waitstaff and the restaurant was not even completely full. I understand lunch hours are busy but I feel like the service was marginal at best. I was very disappointed. I left a tip but not nearly as high as I usually tip. I really like BJ's but I think I will stick to the BJ's in the Natomas area instead where I've up always gotten outstanding service.
Lydia H.,Dixon  CA,135,316,352,4/24/2015,3.0,"They lost our reservation for some reason so we had to wait 45 minutes. A waitress spilled one of our drinks and knocked over a knife.They brought out our appetizers at the same time as our food. Did not refill our drinks. When my husband asked for another beer the waiter said he would let ""our"" waiter know. We had to ask 3 times for water. It took us nearly 3 hours from start to finish  very slow service. For the prices they charge I would expect better.That being said  we enjoyed pizza samples while we waited and the manager came by to check on us.The food did taste great and the pizzookie was awesome. Great selection of drinks.But overall  the experience was just ok."
Adriana A.,San Francisco  CA,0,9,2,10/5/2016,1.0,Extremely unprofessional  had a fundraiser set up at this restaurant. Had It confirmed two weeks prior to the date. Bjs cancelled on us while some of our guest were there. They acted like they did not know about the fundraiser. Managers refused to talk to us. Will never host another fundraisers here. Extremely disappointed with the outcome  they just lost about 50+ customers.
Jim S.,Sacramento  CA,5,26,3,12/5/2016,2.0,First time here. My server was a very nice am helpful  She always made sure to stop as she would go by to see if we needed anything. Booths a to small for a person over 6 feet. It was not very busy. Food for the price was not as grand as you would think. My steak was more Medium then Med rare. Portions were small on all our orders except for the hamburger that my son ordered. Beer was good had two of the samplers so I could try most of what they offered. Try it out it is a nice place maybe thing will be different for you.
Emily W.,Sacramento  CA,61,21,,9/10/2017,2.0,"Well my visit here tonight was a bust. I went with my friend this evening and when we put in our name we were told it should only be about ten minutes. After thirty minutes we decided we should check seeing as all of the people who had come in after us were already seated. As it turns out they forgot to put in our name. Accidents happen and we were promptly seated. Our server immediately came up and introduced himself and took our drink orders (just water since we had not yet had a chance to glance over the menu) which he quickly returned with. A few minutes later a gentleman turned up with two more waters looking confused at the water already sitting on the table  it was obvious there had been a miscommunication somewhere. Oh well  four waters isn\'t a problem  it\'s important to stay hydrated right? Then another gentleman (the only reason I gave two stars and not one) showed up to take our order and explained he was filling in for our server. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza. Our original server brought out the appetizer but no plates. We waited and waited. I finally had to go hunt down plates myself. When I returned our pizza was being dropped and then finally plates. I felt terrible when the ""fill in"" server saw our untouched (and now cold) appetizer and pizza and apologized for them coming out at the same time after we had requested the appetizer first. I explained he was not at fault and we dug into our cold avocado egg rolls where my friend immediately found an avocado belly button. We tried to laugh it off but it was getting harder to do so by this point. Next the pizza. It didn\'t have any sauce on it. We explained to our server that it was dry and didn\'t appear to have sauce and he offered ranch dressing. No apology. No offer to remake it. We ate one price and decided it was time for dessert. They can\'t possibly mess up a pizooki right? WRONG. It was hot dough. Mush topped with ice cream. We couldn\'t finish it. That was a first."
Terrelle K.,Sacramento  CA,532,36,54,5/7/2016,4.0,One of my favorite places to eat and have drinks. Especially if one of your favorite teams are playing. Chances are it's playing on one of their many flat screens. I love their pizzas here   the selections are wide and their wings is a must try.
Carolyn S.,Sacramento  CA,4,2,,6/5/2017,1.0,Worst experience I've ever had. It took bjs 2 1/2 hours to cook our order for 2 entrees. Eat24 was extremely helpful trying to get our order delivered. They even refunded us the delivery fee  even though it was bjs fault. Will never order from bjs again.
Donovan H.,Citrus Heights  CA,292,313,1294,2/16/2014,4.0,"You know how I feel about chain restaurants.. Especially when the food is predictable at any place you go to from coast to coast. However  I will admit that the food at ""BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse"" is slightly above what you would find at say  a TGIFridays  Applebee\'s  and Chili\'s. With that said and done  ""BJ\'s"" is probably my favorite go-to spot for consistently good standard comfort food.What makes this ""BJ\'s"" different than most is that their building is integrated in the Arden Fair Mall. This makes it a very convenient location after a complete day of shopping. And I like the fact that (even on the busiest days and evenings)  parking isn\'t too difficult to find. For those of you who remember  the building itself used to be part of the (not-so-popular) ""California Cafe"". And when I found out a ""BJ\'s"" was set to open in early-2011  my excitement grew as I\'ve always loved their amazing brewed craft beers.My review that I am focusing on is their Happy Hour that runs every Monday through Friday from 3-7pm. This is probably the best thing that ""BJ\'s"" has going on and their prices are unbeatable. I came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday afternoon around 3:30pm as their was an abundance of empty tables throughout the restaurant. We decided on sitting near the bar as that would be an ideal area to track down the bartender and hostesses. Keep in mind  I\'ve never been here for Happy Hour until this recent experience. I was pretty amazed with the selections that were offered in the $4.00  $5.00  and $6.00 price range. I started off by ordering a ""California Club Flatbread"" with their signature ""BJ\'s P.M. Porter"". Both are priced at a very affordable $4.00/each. Our drinks and food come out in a very timely manner. I was definitely impressed with the size of this flatbread as it had a nice selection of grilled chicken  crisp Applewood smoked bacon  tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It was then completed with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Their P.M. Porter hit the spot too as I\'m a sucker for dark beer. It had the consistency and richness of a Guinness beer but not as thick.As the afternoon migrated into the evening  their were many more appetizers that we took advantage of before the 7:00pm Happy Hour cutoff time. For $4.00  I also sampled their ""Margherita Fresca Flatbread"" and ""Boneless Wings"". The flatbread was decent but not as good as the ""California Club"". We loved the wings though as they packed the perfect amount of spice to every bite. For $5.00  we sampled their ""Chicken Pot Stickers"" which were pretty good but were slightly undercooked. And finally for $6.00  we sampled their (very popular) ""Avocado Egg Rolls"". These definitely hit the spot  crispy on the outside and soft avocado on the inside; especially after I was already working on my 4th beer at this point.Overall  I\'d have to say if you\'re NOT coming here for Happy Hour  I\'d have to rate ""BJ\'s"" only 3-stars. I\'ve dined here on numerous occasions in the past and the food is your predictable standard comfort food. But the Happy Hour makes up for that  especially with the affordable deals on the food and craft beers. And if beer isn\'t your thing during Happy Hour  they sell well drinks (for $4.00)  martinis (for $5.00)  and a nice selection of wines (for $6.00). So eat  drink  and be merry at your Arden Fair ""BJ\'s""!"
Leslie T.,Sacramento  CA,45,53,41,3/14/2015,5.0,Craft beers and an extensive menu.I've been to this BJ's twice and I've been to BJ's once in Laguna Blvd. in Elk Grove. I'm glad to say that I haven't had any bad experience with any of the locations.The food is cooked really well  I love coming here for their pizookies  burgers  wings  and of course beer.The place has a nice ambiance and I like coming here to socialize with friends and or dates.
L S.,Sacramento  CA,0,51,2,11/14/2016,5.0,Great service for our free meal on Veterans Day. Appreciate the hospitality for a meal given to us!
Taylor W.,Patterson  CA,68,8,,12/16/2016,3.0,Hosts were very rude. Walked in and they told us to sit near the bar. I said I didn't want to sit there but they insisted on me seating myself. I asked them to seat me in the main eating area but they were too busy with their conversation. Eventually sat where I wanted (they did their job). Service was really good besides the host.
Emily H.,Martinez  CA,4,10,23,3/28/2015,5.0,Service was quick  no wait. Do they only hire attractive people? Lol but I'm not complaining. Food was great  my boyfriend loved his too. but the lime margarita had way too much tequila.
Jessica B.,San Leandro  CA,69,226,65,5/13/2015,4.0,Came in a group of 7 for a birthday dinner around 6 on a Thursday. I was dreading it because of my horrible experiences at BJs in a large party at other locations  but this was not the case at this BJs. Our service was great... I wish I got the name of the waiter but he was really good and patient with our large  indecisive party. For being the middle of a dinner rush- our dinner came out pretty quick.
Alyssa E.,Sacramento  CA,1,5,,12/11/2016,5.0,I have been here a few times now and have always enjoyed my experience. It is a fine dining establishment with a relaxing atmosphere. The employees are all nice and knowledgeable about their ever changing menu. The flatbread is a must. I always get one to share. The crisp crust and fresh ingredients will make these a highlight of the meal. I normally get a seasonal entree. I have had butternut soup  seasonal salads  seared ahi and the ever popular braised tacos. The tacos are not quite traditional  but ever so tasty. Think of a savory braised beef rib in a delicious taco shell. The meat is melt in your mouth goodness. They also have a full bar and a great wine list.
Ameenah M.,Sacramento  CA,410,208,1510,2/28/2014,3.0,It's 4:19 pm and today's my birthday  I wanted to come to bjs to get a pix police for my sisters birthday as well because we're twins. When we walked in apparently the host didn't want to greet us  instead I greeted her. It takes her a long minute to look for a place for us to sit. She comes back and ask of it's ok to sit at the bar and I told her sure. But at the moment I'm on crutches and I had to hop my way up the stairs. I'm looking though the menu and I know I wanted the choose 8 from the 10 beers they have to offer  my server comes by and I tell her what I want and instead of writing down what I wanted she tells me about happy hour. Miss I know about happy hour but this is what I want. We order the traditional chicken wings. The California pizza flatbread  the Parmesan crusted chicken and the sliders. Our drinks come out  then our food. She came to check up on our table but we were good.California pizza flatbread was great  there's avocado  chicken  cheese  tomato... It was pretty simple and good.I love chicken wings so they're always good to me.Sliders were good just cheese  meat  and bread  couldn't ask for ketchup because we finished our meal already. My sister always order the Parmesan crusted chicken  so I'm assuming it's really good to her. Over the food was good. But our server never came back. Usually when you're busy I totally understand  but when you notice that all of our food was gone  you'd come back to check up on us. But she was in the back the whole time  she couldn't have noticed our empty plates. I wanted to order dessert too! It was our birthday  we wanted a pizookie. I was so irritated. Honestly I'd come back because I do like their food  but the service disappointed me. It wasn't even busy.
Ashley P.,Roseville  CA,2,23,,7/13/2016,2.0,I come here super often with coworkers and friends.  For the most part  I've always had good service. I typically sit in the bar and get a lot of the same servers. My experience tonight was so disappointing. Our server seemed to always forget about us. We would have to flag him down for anything we needed. I assumed he was just super busy so I didn't take it personally. But when we let him know we were going to step outside to smoke and that we wanted to let him know we weren't leaving and not paying  he responded saying if we did we needed to leave a card with him. It just felt very insulting especially because of the service we had received. Joshua our server was so cold and I hated feeling like I was some teenager trying to dine and ditch. I spend quite a bit of money here and after tonight I'm reconsidering that.
Theresa T.,Sacramento  CA,7,3,,2/28/2017,1.0,"Let me just start off by saying that I was a big fan of Bjs until my last visit  the food and service is normally stellar but my most recent visit was awful.I was at the restaurant with my family on Friday night  our food arrived and we did not have any utensils and so we asked our waitress to bring some out to us. She seemed busy and was taking longer than desired to bring them so I asked another server for some in the meantime. His response was "" Oh  you didn\'t bring your chopsticks with you?"". You guessed it  my family and I are Asian-Americans. This statement is not only racist  but deplorable and should in no way be tolerated by the establishment. Our utensils were eventually brought to us and our food was great  but the second server\'s disgusting comment left a bad taste in my mouth. I will unfortunately no longer by attending this location  ignorant behavior like that should not be tolerated."
Andi K.,Los Angeles  CA,56,47,148,8/25/2015,5.0,Everything was perfect. Server nice  hh drink excellent. Tuesday all wine 50%. Food tasty. Ambience really nice. Love it. Can wait to go back here.We came back today tfor more. Once again they serve us good  food deliz. And if you have extra money don't forget to oder their desert. Very good. We ordered trio pazookie. Be all agreed the best one was the trio something. Check it out guys.1 more thing for those who doesn't know about the 20 %discount  ask the server. What you need just download their app. After that just ask the server. Have fun guys.One more thing. Don't oder the slider during happy hour. The meat was burn and look likes frozen.
Jen N.,Los Angeles  CA,246,18,159,2/8/2015,5.0,"I know what you are thinking: ""Why are you reviewing a chain restaurant? This is Yelp; we must remain pretentious foodies!""BJ\'s has always been a big favorite of mine for cheap yet still decent quality foods; basically  it\'s a college student\'s Mecca. Ok  fine  I get it Jeremy Stoppelman  you can afford better. But for the rest of us who aren\'t social media CEOs  BJ\'s is the place to go for a classically fun and loud environment  good food  and fantastic deals and coupons you just can\'t pass up.And the best part is how shareable food is. No longer do you have to shoot the death glare at your friend for taking a slice of your pizza! Bring your friends and try the Best Beginnings appetizer combo  a sampler of the most popular appetizers.This BJ\'s location in particular blew me away with their outstanding service. My friend requested to not have ranch on her buffalo chicken pizza (yes  I did remind her of how crazy she was)  but the message seemed to get lost. Oh well  since my friend\'s not allergic  she was going to handle it. The manager came out to speak to us and asked for our names. We all practically excreted in our pants at this moment  scared that we committed a crime we weren\'t aware of (how most of us feel around cops). Then he bent down on one knee  deeply apologized for their mistake  and asked for forgiveness. He hooked her up with free salad and Pizookie Trio. I really can\'t complain. Someone owning up to their mistake before even the receiver can talk about it! Almost unheard of in California  but I\'m glad this chain restaurant still can offer great service. Thank you!"
Luella O.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,4/27/2017,4.0,We were seated in about 5 to 10 minutes  service was great. The baby back ribs were tender and tasty. The meal came with two side dishes  a salad any a mini pazooki. What more can you ask for?
Gabe R.,Sacramento  CA,38,65,6,9/10/2016,3.0,Meh  ok if you're in dire need of sustenance and happen to be in the area. The food is not really that good  I had a Caprese sandwich which resembled a microwaved pizza pocket. Wedge salad looked like it was thrown together quickly and was a sloppy mess  but tasted ok (even though it had the wrong lettuce for a wedge salad). The service was good  very friendly and accommodating. Good beer selection too. Atmosphere is really loud though  couldn't even hear what the person next to me was saying. I won't return unless I have to.
Ashley P.,Sacramento  CA,5,9,1,2/12/2016,2.0,"I have always been a fan of BJ\'s Brewhouse  but I will never go to the one at the Arden location again! My husband and I were extremely disappointed with our experience.We went there at 6:30 PM last Friday night. It was pretty busy  but we were told we could sit in the bar where there were open booths and tables. We sat down and it took several minutes before anyone came to us  which we figured it was OK because it was a Friday night. A server with a blond ponytail finally came with menus and I immediately ordered our drinks because she seemed like she was in a rush; however  she went to the next table where she must have known the people because she took her time to talk to them for a few minutes. It was close to 10 minutes before we received our drinks and our server passed by us a few times without saying anything. When the drinks finally came she made a remark about the wait being over and looked like she was about to take off again  so my husband quickly told her that we wanted to order our food. My salad came out first  but my husband\'s Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts appetizer did not come out for a while. When they did  they were charred and burnt to the point that they disintegrated in your mouth. We\'ve gotten this dish before and the brussels sprouts should still be green and intact  unlike these ones that were burnt to a crisp. After that  our server was nowhere to be found. My husband finally asked another server to take back the dish and to please get us a new one that wasn\'t so burnt. After a while our server came back with the Brussels Sprouts  rolled her eyes and said ""Here you go. These should be better""  but they looked like the same exact dish! The server took off before we could say anything. We decided to enjoy our pizza instead (which wasn\'t all that great)  but knew I did not want to pay for these brussels sprouts because they were no better than the last one. When we were done with our pizza we waited a while for server to come back  but she was nowhere to be found. Our drinks had also been empty for quite some time so by the time she came to check on us my husband was irritated and asked for a box and the bill. She brought us our bill  saw that we had two slices of pizza left and said ""gee I guess you didn\'t really need a box"" and walked away. Ready to leave  I checked our bill which charged us for BOTH of the Brussels Sprouts dishes. At this point I got up and asked the front hostess if we could speak to the manager. We explained to the manager that we weren\'t happy with the dish and that our server was constantly disappearing. He apologized and said that the dish was one of his favorites and that it shouldn\'t look anything like that. He let us know that he would talk to the cook and that we would not have to pay either dish. He took our plates then our server came out with the revised check and was clearly annoyed that we spoke to her manager. Before I could even reach for my card she hurried off. We waited for her to collect our payment  but she was once again nowhere to be found  so we flagged down the manager. My husband mentioned that we could never find the sever when we needed her and that she seemed annoyed every time she did come by our table. He apologized again and rang up our bill. My husband was so irritated with the experience that he went to wait outside while I signed my receipt. As I got up from the booth the server finally came back and gave me a very fake smile which I did not return.We appreciated the manager\'s diligence  assisting us with our bill  and for taking responsibility; however  the food and service were so poor that we will not return. I really hope he spoke to the server too. I\'m not going to blame her for everything that happened  since the kitchen burnt our food  but we were never rude to her nor did we do anything to cause her to treat us like she did. Maybe she was having a bad night  but I have worked in customer service for many years and know that you need to keep your personal issues away from the work place  especially when you are working to get a tip. All in all  we were very unhappy with the experience."
Eddy A.,Rio Linda  CA,4,63,5,5/2/2016,4.0,Very busy place Saturday night  but we had a great server  a young tall black gal that took good care of us 4.Now  the lousy news  I had the Mahi-Mahi with shrimp and it was dry and boring. Not something I would order again.I would have dropped the stars to 3 if it weren't the excellent service.Cheers All!
Ariel G.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,7/28/2016,1.0,My husband ordered a pizza for curbside. It took them 40 minutes to bring out the food. My husband spoke with the manager and all he did to compensate our loss of time was offer him a cheap dessert as if that would give us out 40 minutes back. We've eaten at this location before. The service inside is terrible. This is slowest restaurant we have ever been to. Dinning at bj's will cost you 3 hours of your time and mediocre cold or burnt food.
K C.,Minneapolis  MN,0,7,,5/12/2017,4.0,I'd give this place 3.5  but I'll round up to four. There are some pretty good weekly/happy hour specials. Normally I would think the food is a little overpriced for the quality  but if you take advantage of the specials it's pretty decent. Service is always just fine  too. Good place to get buzzed up and eat some alright/good pub food.
Shane K.,North Highlands  CA,90,93,78,8/13/2016,4.0,every single BJs i have went to was always a great positive experience. at this Arden Mall location we enjoyed the server and i was a little bit in bewilderment not being able to see the Olympics on the TV screens. anyways  I had the pasta which was mediocre to me..The pizzas and drinks are very tasty i must say that!will go again. The bathrooms are clean  stylish and small. I love the vibe there which is young hip and family all at once. the dark wood is a nice elegant touch.
Lee D.,Sacramento  CA,7,71,860,4/6/2016,4.0,Got the Alabama sunkiss  pepperoni & clam chowder  steak & mash and fries and meat lover panini? All good just pricey for the portion typical of place like this.
Sharon C.,Yuba City  CA,0,22,33,5/8/2016,4.0,A gem in the mall. Jeremiah Red is an American treasure. Tried the Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were fantastic. I recommend trying it if yoy like pitas. Server forgot my salad but redeemed herself by not charging me for it after promptly getting the order in and to me.
Bianca N.,Sacramento  CA,257,114,80,8/6/2016,5.0,Matt J. was out waiter and prefer his section because he is always so friendly and helpful. He knows the good tasting dishes on the menu. He recommended the tortilla soup and it was so good. The added squeeze of lime added a great touch to the appetizer. We also indulged in the capres salad  with balsamic dressing that was not too vinigery and not too sweet. The main course I got the Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs because i had been craving it for a long time. And I decided that I wouldn't wait not one moment longer and ordered a beer that had a hint of lemonade  please try it ! . Boyfriend ordered the Shrimp and penne pasta. Of course  I dug my fork in his plate like I always to and it was flavorful  not too heavy and not overly salty. He did claim he didn't have that much shrimp but that the dish was very good. We skipped out on the dessert because  well we really didn't want to over so it...lol.. Again I have always enjoyed myself here  the bartenders and specifically Matt J. have always been super cool and atentive. Thanks Matt ! Until the next time ..
Dacia G.,Union City  CA,0,2,,4/15/2017,5.0,Their deep dish pizza is to die for!!!! That accompanied with a chocolate chip pizookie makes up te perfect meal.
Angel F.,Roseville  CA,229,64,251,3/28/2015,5.0,I am giving them 5 stars today because I never knew they served brunch on a weekend. To add to that  the bonus is ordering buttermilk pancakes  French toast  omelettes or just scrambled eggs are the best! All the meals are an awesome portion & no skimping on any part. They serve a great amount of scrambled eggs  for pancakes  they serve 5 huge thick stacks! You will get fed! I am relieved for that. The fact I can bring my kids of different ages & that they can have an awesome meal & get full off of w/out being picky is perfect for me! Now I know I can definitely come here for breakfast  brunch with fam & friends gathering & also have kids come along to enjoy eating too. I will definitely come back again for brunch!!!!
Angelica C.,San Francisco  CA,258,37,52,7/16/2016,2.0,Came to bjs for a late dinner after the Cali state fair. Ordered clam chowders for me but it was barely warm when it came out so it tasted weird. So did the broccoli cheddar my bf ordered. The Bjs clam chowder in concord and Vacaville were better. We were trying to get ahold of our waiter to order pizookies but she was nowhere to be found until we saw her a couple tables down chatting it up with other servers. When she did walk by  we asked her how long it would take to bring out a pizookie she said 5-7 minutes. We asked because it was 30 min till closing time and we didn't want to give the kitchen a hard time for putting in last minute order. And yup pizookie didn't come till closing:(
Nicole B.,Sacramento  CA,497,244,224,10/20/2014,5.0,I had a great time here! The food is great  the staff is professional  we'll dressed  organized and the prices are fair.We came in late and sat in the cocktail area  where we were served by a very sweet girl with an accent  I cannot remember her name for the life of me. But I do remember that she is vegetarian too! So she was very understanding that I wanted my pizza without meat  and when I got it WITH meat on it she immediately knew how gross it feels to us vegetarians to just pick it off so she offered to remake it right away. Knowing that my boyfriend eats meat because his order was a meatlovers pizza  she offered him a box for my messed up pizza so he could take it home and enjoy it later. That was really cool of her! He did take it home and ate it for lunch the next day  he said it was very  very good!It took a while for my pizza  eventually the chef came walking out with it  that's right  the chef made it a point to come all the way to our table to apologize saying that it was his mistake. Obviously we were more than understanding because it happens every where  all the time but I just felt for the first time that someone actually cared and that was really nice. The waitress and the chef(next time I visit I'm going to find their names) had outstanding customer service skills and helped us have a fabulous experience at this BJs! As always  BJs food was delicious  the martinis were spot on and we had a great time. We will be back soon!
Jessica S.,HI  HI,0,22,1,8/23/2016,3.0,My husband and I always stop here for dinner when we are visiting family in town. The service is average. The food is a hit and miss.
Eric B.,Roseville  CA,1,11,8,6/28/2016,1.0,Typical chain restaurant. The service leaves a lot to be desired at the price point. My server spent more time conversing with her co-workers than waiting on our table. Pretty bad when you have to ask for refills and setups. From the look of the staff they could use some diversity. More seasoned professional servers and bar staff could very well improve the quality of service delivery. Nothing here to make me want to revisit this venue. If you want average food with below average service by all means this is your restaurant. Only thing management has going is location  location  location.
Diana O.,Sacramento  CA,0,12,18,2/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,BJs is the place to go for my family when we want fast excellent service. The food is always consistent and the value Is always great! When we have a Birthday or special occasion or just want to sit down as a family for a meal BJ's is always the perfect choice. Thank you for making my job easier and taking care of the family table. It's not always easy working a full time job and feeding a family of 7.We appreciate your consistency!Another visit:I can always count on BJ's for providing us a table when we sit down as a family to celebrate or even gather for a family meal. Kyle did an excellent job serving us and making sure we had what we needed.
Eddie R.,Twentynine Palms  CA,41,110,311,10/12/2016,5.0,We ate dinner here on 9-12-16 it was very good Love their salad that you're a dressing is delicious had to look it up how they made it mine ate quite as good but not that it was a Caesar salad and chicken was very good I like BJ's haven't had a bad at any of them I've been to and service is out of this world
Angie O.,Woodland  CA,30,41,23,11/19/2015,4.0,"This particular BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of my favorite because it is pretty much attached to the Arden Fair Mall. I usually like to end my shopping with a nice meal from BJ\'s  and I\'ve made it kind of routine at this point.Obviously  BJ\'s is a chain restaurant. That ALONE will deter your average hipster from giving this place a visit but it\'s really one the few chains I continue to visit  and for good reasons. Their menu is extensive. I\'m a fan of simpler menu\'s  but I like that there is something for everyone (salads  burgers  sandwiches  pasta  steak  etc.) and they have really expanded on their enLIGHTened (healthier) menu options. The pizza here is pretty good  I really like that they have thin crust options and you can also ""build your own"" pizza. Their sandwiches are also yummy and I would suggest you get Wedge Cut Fries with any burger or sandwich because they are seriously a better choice. They have a large selection of Brews (hence the name) and I love that every season they have a variety of season-inspired drinks.  Service. It can be hit or miss but for the most part it is average. Average as in attentive but not annoying  informative but not pushy. I\'ve had both good and mediocre experiences with service but never a bad one  so I\'d say that\'s a plus. TIP: If the host or hostess seat you in a spot where you don\'t want to sit  speak up  they usually have no problem with letting you sit where you want  and won\'t give you that sarcastic ""SURE"" (that is a big PLUS  for me) Ambiance- Casual. It can get loud but not bothersome.The #1 reason I keep coming back: THOSE PZOOKIES!!. A warm delicious cookie of your choice topped with creamy Ice Cream?? Delicious!! My favorite Pzookies are the White Chocolate Macademia  or the original Chocolate Chip! Perfect way to end an exhausting shopping trip!"
Mike A.,Sacramento  CA,2,7,,2/19/2017,1.0,Wait person decent. $17 mini pizza came out luke warm and $17 salad with ahi tuna totally inedible. Took 15 minutes to get two drinks.
Ashiana K.,Vacaville  CA,102,196,394,11/18/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Now  that I\'m Gluten Free  I just had to try their GF pizza and pizookie!!My hubby and went on a double date and of course chose BJ\'s because they\'re still promoting their 2 for $20 deal (soup/salad  entree  and dessert for two folks). We ordered the GF veggie pizza with roasted garlic and spinach and it was incredibly delicious! I didn\'t feel like I was missing out on traditional pizza at all!We also got the GF pizookie and I must say that flour is such an essential ingredient to a cookie  lol but the pizookie wasn\'t that bad. I think it was a little overcooked but it was still ""eat-able"" and we had them top it with the peppermint ice cream (now that the holiday flavors are in!)Our server was decent but not memorable. What I didn\'t appreciate was I wanted to use a Visa gift card towards the bill and was told that the card was declined because BJ\'s run all their cards as ""debit"" and not ""credit"". Uhh  we live in 2013..large franchised restaurants should be able to run ""credit"" when handed a credit card  debit card  or Visa/AMEX gift card. This was definitely a turn-off but whatever. The GF pizza left me in a good mood so I didn\'t complain."
James W.,Garberville  CA,0,2,,3/19/2017,2.0,The food was okay; nothing special. The pizookies are worth it  but that's about it. I personally had a terrible experience with the service  as my order took over forty five minutes  despite the waiter and manager assuring me multiple times that it would be just a couple minutes. Once I did receive the food  the manager seemed intent on trying to make it up to me with a $20 card of credit  but honestly I just wanted him to leave me alone. He probably came by the table five times  and I just wanted to eat my dang food! Also  after dinner  the pizookies took forever as well. I won't be back.
Chris G.,West Sacramento  CA,6,23,16,8/14/2016,4.0,Parking aside this is a great spot to grab some ice cold beers and yummy food. Atmosphere is typical to all BJ's but the staff here is better than at other locations. It seem like you always have to wait a little while to be seated but you can always grab a seat in the bat area right away.
Annie V.,San Francisco  CA,260,53,32,11/22/2014,4.0,I don't come here a lot but I always have a good food experience eating here. We didn't have to wait for a table even though the place was packed. Our waitress was nice too :). Bison bbq burger - it was a bit dry but then again at 650 calories for a burger you can't expect too much dressing or extra condiments. It has a salsa like topping added into the burger which was a fresh taste to compliment the meat. There was also a side of salad with red onions  lettuce  and more onions. I didn't mind because I love onions :D! For a total of ~$10 (including tips) it's quality is fair.
Sean H.,Redwood City  CA,34,76,12,10/18/2015,4.0,Pros:Quality beerDecent selectionGluttonous PiezookieFriendly staff (thanks Anthony!)Cons:Strange  mood-lit bathroomFried artichokes are pickled and terribleSmall dairy-free selectionI would come again  and recommend this place to most people I know. Great place to catch a bite after a Comedy Sports Show (cmzsacramento.com)  which is exactly what we did. It rounded out a great evening.
Margaret L.,San Ramon  CA,372,563,243,5/22/2013,3.0,Chain restaurant.Decent pizza. Not amazing but it will satisfy you if you want deep dish. I usually get the deep dish pizza if I come here. I am not a fan of red sauce  and they can substitute it with white sauce.I think the biggest pro of this place is the pizookie. A warmly baked fresh cookie with ice cream on top? I think I may have some! It's delicious. I would recommend the unique flavors like red velvet and the white chocolate raspberry. I am a big fan of the white chocolate raspberry. Pizookie is such a simple idea. For the bakers out there  they know how easy it is to make cookies and scoop ice cream on top. But when the cookie flavors are more unique  then it's worth it. I came here for the pizookie trio and I left happy.Overall  the food is mediocre. Good happy hour. You can also do bar seating if you don't want to wait. Since this location is at the mall  it's convenient to find and you can go shopping before or afterwards!
Jason P.,Sacramento  CA,212,193,1,4/19/2016,3.0,Typically I'm a fan of BJ's. And being my second time around at this location  I thought my experience would have been somewhat better...But it wasn't . So  we decided to stop by for drinks  app and a Pazooki ( I think it's spelled)  Being it was a Monday evening and the weather was perfect for dining out on the patio. Well  as we were approached by the host we politely asked him if we could have a table out on the patio. It wasn't busy and it was only the two of us. So  he says he has to go get the waiter to seat us (Odd  I thought that was HIS job?) So as that left us confused and he disappears. Another house with an abrupt look on her face asked if we been helped. We stated yes  but...(Oh  yea she said Ok  swung her hair and turned her back on us as we were still talking to her.) Excuse me.... So the original host comes back and says  he can't sit us on the patio because the waiter has a large party (Table of probably 6 people) in the inside dining area.... WTF?! We are all kinds of confused at this point. So  we opt to sit inside the super cold dining area. That's phase one.So now we're seated  and we wait another 10 minutes before we are greeted by our waitress. So that's about 20 minutes wait time so far. Luckily she had a bubbly personality because I was going to say something about the wait. We order our drinks and ordered a side of fries because at this point we are just over it. The drinks come  my Margarita is full of ice. If I wanted a cup of ice  I would have asked for one. And my partner ordered some new Champagne drink  that looked nothing like the pic. Horrible presentation. And the sad part he had to send it back and tell them how to make their own drink. Like really? Who is running this place? Now the fries come out......So I guess someone ordered the friend and didn't want them so they set out till someone else ordered them and lucky us we got them. They were burnt  but felt uncooked... So we sent them back  then they come back with a higher stack of fries. Then the waiter says  they felt bad so they gave us more.. Nooo... you but more fries on top of the old because the top few fries were hot and the bottom were colder. I'm getting pissed off all over again. So that was a fail.Then I thought I give the Margarita a second try. But in a Margarita glass. Just another glass of ice. I'm so irritated cuz now these people are playing with my money. The Pazooki has arrived  and we're like ok this looks good. My spoon can't break through the cookie.... Hat's off!. Did they really send us a burnt cookie. Which I take it the manager took off the bill. But hell  everything we had was a mess. I don't know what's going on with this BJ's but they need a major overhaul. This location is a HUGE disappointment! We should have went with our first mind and we to Cheesecake Factory. They have not yet to disappoint. SMH @ BJ'S!
Blake B.,Elk Grove  CA,115,40,31,10/29/2015,1.0,Tried this location for the second time. Each time we go here there are too many things wrong with the place. I ordered the avocado rolls which are always good for an appetizer. Than I saw the crispy calamari on the menu and order it next along with 2 mini pizzas. The calamari came out and they weren't anything crispy it felt as if they were not thaws out I honestly felt like I was eating octopus and I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. Disgusting - one starOur deep dish pizzas came out and I'm starving but it didn't taste right meaning the bread was too soft as if they rushed it out. - one star Waited for my drink and for the wrong one and right one finally came out when I finished my pizza. - one star Overall I like the brand but this location has let me down far too many times. Another minus star for multiple attempts.
Cwiddy B.,Sacramento  CA,13,51,23,10/1/2015,1.0,"Worst customer service ever. Our waitress  some chick with brown hair tied in a bun made us never want to come back  I should of stuck to the BJ\'s in Elk Grove where when the servers make a mistake they will fix it themselves and are very friendly.My friend & I ordered something super simple.I got the BJ\'s brewhouse burger & he got some type of tomato shrimp pasta. She asked what appetizer we wanted and we both told her calamari. Long after we ordered our food  we asked where our calamari was. She did some weird fake laugh didn\'t even apologize & made some other waiter give it to us. No apology  no nothing. We had to flag down the manager and he kept making some lame excuses for the cooks saying ""they took a really long time to make it."" The calamari was then docked off our bill  however it was the waitress\'s job to let them know she completely forgot about us & what we wanted.I also forgot to mention  there were people seated around us 20 minutes after we arrived & their food got there way before ours. Why? Our money is just as green as everyone else\'s. All we wanted was some food and ok experience  it was just horrible."
Mike S.,Pacifica  CA,0,4,,9/4/2015,1.0,"Went in on a Thursday night with a large party (13 people). It took forever for the waiter to take our food order and then forever for the food to make it to the table ... except mine ... mine was not there. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger  a seemingly easy  even harmless order. Nothing. After waiting another ten minutes  a burger was put in front of me ... A burger  not MY burger. My burger  I was told  was given away to another table  but I can ""chew on this other burger until my order is ready"". What?! The waiter was apologetic  but he kept trying to sell me on this other burger. Well  I was hungry so I ate it ... then my actual order arrived in a pan  not a plate  but a cookie sheet-like pan.Yeah  I think I\'m done."
Dorothy N.,Suisun City  CA,0,19,,3/1/2017,2.0,We went up to Sacramento to visit our granddaughter  who is attending Sac State. We took her out to lunch  and to say I was extremely disappointed would be an understatement. Food was mediocre at best  but our server  Kristine B  seemed to be completely overwhelmed. We don't know if it was due to under-staffing  overworked  or if she just was not in a good mood  but it took forever for her to take our orders  and we never got any additional service for coffee/drink refills at all. Cost  without tip  was $73.49  and it was nothing to brag about. The really sad part was we had to go up to the cashier desk in order to find our server to get our check. To us  the only good thing about this restaurant is the location..but bear in mind it is in a large shopping center and parking is a total pain. While we cannot speak for our granddaughter  we know we personally will not be back.
Ala Mode P.,Union City  CA,0,12,,2/24/2017,1.0,Food is bland and so ordinary. Nothing special about the food at this restaurant. My son ordered steak  and the steak was too dry. I ordered Spicy Pig Pizza  and there was nothing special about this pizza. In fact  it had an awful smell. This is not the first time I was dissatisfied about the food being served at this restaurant. I don't think I will ever be back at this restaurant. Our bill was $60.00  and I still gave the server a $10 tip although we were not happy. Such a waste of money!!!!!
Jonathan Y.,Sacramento  CA,45,20,9,7/13/2016,4.0,Delicious beer and a fantastic waitstaff. Thanks for a yummy beer with my.baked ziti. Will do again.
Gordon H.,Sacramento  CA,0,33,3,8/13/2015,2.0,Love the house porter & the seared ahi salad!Half of the servers here are transfers from fast food who ask stupid questions  make stupid comments  or try to become familar. Plus  the incessant pushing of yet another rewards program and another stupid card I don't want.Please install self-service ordering kiosks like those at Applebees! They really cut down on all the needless chatter.Great TV's & HH specials during football games.
Kalyee J.,Sacramento  CA,0,4,,2/20/2017,4.0,"I am a huge fan of BJ\'s! I go there quite often and the service is always great as well as the food. They have plenty of options and have something for everyone. The dessert is wonderful! They have ""pizzookies"" which is a hot cookie (still in it\'s own mini pan) with melty delicious ice cream on top. It is one of my favorite desserts ever. They have many flavors too though ny favorite is by far the cookies and cream one. It is a cookies and cream cookie with vanilla ice cream and like a cookies and cream mousse/whip cream on top. So good! I wish they took reservations for many times I\'ve had to go somewhere else because the wait is unreasonable."
Vania C.,Castro Valley  CA,692,356,197,9/8/2014,3.0,The place and service itself was great but the food was a little interesting. There was a 49ers gaming going on when I came to eat with my roommate so I wasn't super surprised that it was super loud when there was a touchdown. For lunch  I had the New Orleans Style Jambalaya and my roommate had the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. Mine was ok but it bugged me a bit that I kept finding bits of angel hair pasta in my rice. Strange but at least it didn't mess with the taste. My roommate's pasta was a little mushy and dry but still the favor was good. The lemonades were amazing. I had the strawberry lemonade and it was super refreshing  sweet but still had the perfect balance of sour. The lemonade was coated with sugar on top of the glass  smart to balance out the sour flavor (not for the strawberry lemonade though  which already has the strawberries for that). Price was a bit high  about 40 bucks for a lunch. It was good but wouldn't be something I'd get all the time. Will be back eventually for the pizza though :]
Amanda D.,Sacramento  CA,34,4,,7/14/2017,1.0,If I could leave zero stars I would. Ordered drinks from the bar and an appetizer. got our food 15 min later and no drinks. My husband asked several people still no drinks. My husband finally had to go get the manager who finally came back with drinks and an apology. He said they were going to comp us dessert and was very apologetic. Waitress came back and apologized and told us dessert was on them our dessert is a cookie with ice cream you choose the flavor or 2 flavors and split it. We ate our food and my drink went down rather quickly and when she came to ask if we wanted anything else I asked for a soda. Never got the soda told her to give the cookie and ice cream to our kids at their table. I found their service to be extremely shitty and I will never go back there. I couldn't wait to get home so I could get something to drink. My husband left her a $5 dollar tip I told him to leave nothing. I have gotten better service at a fast food joint then I got at this restaurant. Never again!
Raquel N.,Natomas  Sacramento  CA,0,10,6,1/29/2017,2.0,When I think of BJs restaurant I think of good food and typically good service. Welly friend and I went to lunch the other day and I have to say I only got one thing I was looking for. The food was awesome! Everything came out how we wanted it. But I have to jump the gun and explain why I probably won't be going back. When we got seated I over heard out server was supposed to be going home. Fine  I get wanting to go home after a long day. He took our order after seeming way more involved in all his other tables. It was almost as if he didn't want to take us because he was supposed to be going home and we are younger women. Our good came out very promptly and everything way right. We asked for a couple little things that were forgotten  no big deal. But then when we were almost done eating things got AWKWARD! My friend and I are catching up so we were probably talking a little loud  but the staff started having a full argument not even 3 feet away from us. Staff start blaming each other and the manager was involved. People saying they are going to call out because the didn't get the day off. I get having disagreements and needing to hash things out. But seriously right in front of us? It could have happened in a place more appropriate. It was so distracting we had stopped our conversation because the argument was vocal enough to were we had forgotten what we were talking about. So we patiently waited for them to be done so we could ask for boxes. But instead our waiter stormed off and once again ignored us. We asked a different waiter  paid our ticket and got out as soon as possible. I have never had such an awkward restaurant experience. I hate the fact that we did because I really liked the food. But servers make of break things in my opinion. And this place didn't make my experience at all.
Mayra T.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,1,1/28/2017,4.0,Always a great meal when I come here. I ordered wings for appetizer and was surprised at how many wings it came with. Overall good experience!
Joanne C.,Los Angeles  CA,78,70,284,1/17/2015,3.0,I love their ahi poke appetizer! I wish they served more chips with it though because I always run out before I finish the poke. The great white is my personal favorite in terms of pizza. The shrimp scampi pasta is also good. For beer I get the Berry Burst Cider & of course you can't leave without having a pizookie. Service is a hit or miss. Some days you'll luck out with an attentive server and on others you don't even get checked on.
Kayla K.,San Ramon  CA,3,46,6,7/27/2014,5.0,Came in on a Friday night around 10:30pm. It wasn't that busy and we got to pick our seats in the bar area. No complaints  the food and service were both great. Tried the bacon chicken and ranch pizza for the first time and it was soo good! The new peanut butter s'mores pizookie is a must try if you like these flavors!
Katy S.,Sacramento  CA,54,56,104,9/28/2015,2.0,"The calamari  stuffed mushrooms  and lemon grass chicken were very good. We ordered two jambalaya and a grilled chicken Alfredo. The Jambalyas were pretty good just a bit too flavorful. But the Alfreda was a bit hard. The service wasn\'t that good. Our server was William k as per the receipt wasn\'t that friendly. He didn\'t interact with us or anything but he did interact with the other table right next to ours. Which I don\'t get  aren\'t servers suppose to be equally friend or engaging to their tables? That how it was when I was working as a server back then. But things might have changed. When I told him my noodles were hard  he said there was nothing they can do about it bc there were already sauce on there. I mean isn\'t that how it\'s suppose to come with the sauce? Or couldn\'t he have said oh let me ask the chef to make you another one or would you like something else? But no he didn\'t ask anything like that  he just said there\'s nothing we can do about it. So I said ok  please bring me a box to take it to go. When he came back he just tossed the box on the table and didn\'t even say anything; not even a here\'s your box and he turned to the table next to us and starting talking to them. I\'ve been to bjs plenty of times but never had bad service like this before. Maybe he was having a bad day  but like my companion said maybe he just didn\'t like servicing us bc of how friendly we were and how race? ""Shrug"""
A B.,San Francisco  CA,8,45,86,11/29/2015,1.0,So disappointed.Ordered a tortilla soup.Came out cold.Sent it back.The waiter brought back a microwaved lukewarm soup that looked disgusting. I don't understand why they microwaved a soup  and couldn't bring out a fresh hot soup.The waiter was rude  and did close to nothing to help.Surprised because normally I have good service and great food. Maybe just bad luck today . . .
Jamie S.,Sacramento  CA,110,237,85,7/5/2014,3.0,"What is the deal with finding someone to staff their patio?I really like BJs. I really do. Their avocado egg rolls are always a must  and as a vegetarian I can\'t go wrong with either a pizza or veggie burger. Their Jeremiah Red ale is my favorite  and the Tatonka stout is a lovely break during the holiday shopping season. Their massive on-tap selection is worth a stop all on its own. Overall the food is predictable with other chain restaurants with a huge selection; a bunch of stuff that they keep frozen and heat up for you  pretending that they ""made"" it. Not complaining about the food  as that seems to be an industry standard among chain restaurants these days. My point of contention is their patio service. There are relatively few restaurants in the Arden area with patio dining. In fact  I will often try a new place ONLY because they have a patio. If I was trying a place for the first time and was told that their patio dining was an issue  I\'d probably leave to go someplace else. But..... Every single time I have gone to this location and asked to sit outside  the staff asks like I\'m asking them to go above and beyond their job to ""find someone"" to serve the patio. Why? Why do they even have a patio if no one can sit there? Why is it an entire ordeal to sit there? Why do I have to hear from a hostess about how busy the servers are every time I go? Why does asking for a patio table seem to bewilder the hostess so much?Perhaps the bigger question; Why do they even clean the patio tables  set them with condiments drink menus  etc  if they have no intention of sitting anyone there? The last time I went to BJs  I was going only to have a beer with a friend  and we were told that we could only use the patio seating if we first got our drinks at the bar and brought them out ourselves. Next time I might just end up getting my own takeout from a different place before going to BJs. I realize that this most likely is not the hostess\'s fault  but damn. You would think that being this location is less than 500 feet from a Cheesecake Factory  with it\'s near-identical menu and conflict-free patio service  that they would at least have that area staffed."
Julie K.,Sacramento  CA,2,122,32,5/2/2016,2.0,So  my friend and I did the curbside pick up I ordered the club sandwich and request that there be no cheese or sauceGuess what I found? Cheese. I hate cheese  but luckily my sandwich got cold within the 10 minute drive and I was able to peel it off easily.Another thing that really bothered and worried me was how they deal with credit card purchases. They don't have a portable machine  but rather run back inside with your card to make the transaction. I felt very uncomfortable because what if she pulled a Starbucks on me? (You know how that one Starbucks employee stole a customers credit card info and used it to buy junk)So two stores for messed up order  like they usually always seem to do  and for suspicious ring up
May S.,Vallejo  CA,181,66,102,2/28/2016,1.0,I don't usually complain  but people need to know about this place. My friend was visiting from LA and we were both craving pizza  so we decided to come here. I've always loved BJs until now. We order the BJs favorite. Our waitress was a golden blonde Caucasian woman with a pony tail. She did not introduce herself and she seemed to have a lot of attitude. I'm not sure what her deal was but the way she was responding to my friend  whom is African American  did not seem pleasant. As soon as the food came out  she dropped our pizza on the tray stand like a total B and walked away without asking if we needed anything else like a normal waitress does. I was so taken back by her rude demeanor. I would never come here again or recommend this place!
Jen H.,San Jose  CA,366,163,337,10/25/2015,4.0,I love the service here! We got a GREAT SERVER who was filled with energy. I think his name was Albert  not too sure though. My friends and I came here on a Thursday night. Some of the dishes we ordered was the portobello mushrom burger  the southern fried chicken  the steak  fish and chips  and the deep dish pizza. Portobello Mushroom burger - the burger is HUGE !!! Very good portion size. I also recommend the potatoe wedges rather than the thinly cut fries. The wedges tastes a lot better !! But overall the burger was very flavorful and deliciousSouthern fried chicken - BEST DISH EVER. the chicken wasn't dry and very moist!! Loved the crisp on the outside as well. Steak - It was decent.... not my favorite. but good for the price since you get two side ordersFish and Chips - it was okay. Nothing special in my opinion. its your typical fish and chipsDeep Dish Pizza - I personally didn't taste this one but my friends did. They said it was very flavorful and good but they wished it wasnt so pricey. Overall  great service and atmosphere. I would come back! TIP: make a reservation before you come  we had to wait 1.5 hours to get a table!!
Rhonda L.,Sacramento  CA,0,3,,1/20/2017,2.0,We tried the food but it wasn't that good to me and servers was not very friendly.. Wouldn't go here again or would not refer none of my friends to go to this place..
Erick G.,The Pocket-Greenhaven  Sacramento  CA,2,19,2,12/17/2015,5.0,Good service and good selection of beer! I like that we can order ahead of time with the app and they take Apple Pay. Cool spot to chill with some friends and drink up. The employees are pretty chill for the most part.
Henry C.,Woodland  CA,46,110,60,12/16/2015,4.0,This is my first time at the Arden location  the other times we have gone have been to the Natomas location.Although it was a busy Saturday night  we enjoyed our time here.We LOVE LOVE LOVE their Mediterranean pizza!! We took some out of town friends here and they also loved the food!Although I prefer Natomas over Arden  this is one tasty restaurant!!!Both places have awesome personnel working for them !If you haven't been to a BJ's  you must go try them!
Susan S.,Sacramento  CA,0,27,4,6/18/2016,4.0,this is a great restaurant  although during busy times it can get noisy. The servers are wonderful and the food is really good and has a big menu. One of my favorites is the deep fried artichoke hearts. Yum!
justin s.,Elk Grove  CA,225,55,17,11/18/2015,2.0,This place is okay. Food is great but  this place doesn't have that many TV''s and is kind of small and my fork had something on the back of it? I'm not coming back to this place...
Lawrence K.,West Hartford  CT,81,102,25,9/20/2015,4.0,Food is great. Lots of options. Love their traditional wings. Brisket burger is also a good choice. Have also previously tried their Caesar salad and tomato soup and both were great. My only complaint is it sometimes takes forever to be seated. I waited 15 to 20 mins today and nobody came to help seat me or any of the others in line  even after we asked for some assistance.
Jamie P.,Sacramento  CA,1,3,2,12/10/2015,5.0,It was great the burgers and fries were delicious. I'm definitely coming back to this place when I go ou again. Filled me up for the rest of the day.
Sac M.,Sacramento  CA,39,179,422,7/3/2015,5.0,Like most locations this is another good one great food great service coo drinks one of my favorite places I'm such a regular here u can't go wrong here
Amy H.,Arden-Arcade  Sacramento  CA,0,4,,1/15/2017,1.0,So first off I really love BJ's but as a mall employee who works over nights my experience with pick up the last 4 or 5 times have been horrible. I order my good always like an hour before and I go on my lunch which is only half hour long and then I stand around waiting and waiting and waiting and no one helps me. Tonight I ordered my lunch I went in at 9 to pick up. My sandwich was ready but I had to wait 15 minutes for a house salad to be made. As I got there it took about 3 minutes to even have someone ask if I've been helped it took another 5 minutes for someone to let me know it would be a couple minutes and there were about 5 workers standing in the take out area talking with another girl who I believe works there and it took another 10 minutes to finally get my good. And I get back to my store which is at Arden mall to find out that I was then missing soemthing in my order and it was to late to go back or to call. As a mall employee I am highly disappointed in the service I received.
Jennifer R.,Redding  CA,14,62,47,5/13/2016,5.0,The service we received yesterday was great. We ordered a pizza to start off with and it was like the server read my mind by bringing ranch to the table. The Cesar salad I ordered tasted like it had been sitting in the back for awhile. The server immediately grabbed it and said he would take care of it but before he went off to do that he ASKED if I wanted the same or different salad. I thought that the way he asked was very thoughtful. I was happy with the new Cesar salad he brought back. My nephew dropped a water we had at the table and he quickly grabbed a rag to help clean up. Wish I could remember the servers name. Overall we had a great experience.
Lynette D.,Sacramento  CA,3,94,9,3/29/2016,4.0,So on Easter  our family came here and I had a wonderful omelet. It was so delicious and the salsa that they have there is fantastic. We had excellent service. My son had spaghetti and he loved it. The best part of all was watching people trying to open the door to Arden Fair Mall (closed for Easter). It was hilarious to see people get angry or large families milling around like they were completely lost!
Andrew B.,Plumas Lake  CA,1,6,,6/28/2016,1.0,Go to the BJ's in Roseville. The Arden location has horrible service and the food doesn't taste as good as the Roseville restaurant. Our server was slow and had a dirty shirt on.
Aubree S.,Sacramento  CA,0,5,,4/1/2015,1.0,"Grosss . I loved it here till the day I had lasagna and the meat was like the meat they have on frozen pizza. Ya know those lil balls of sausage and the square prices of pepperoni . I thought they cooked their food not defrosted.. unfortunate they lost loyal customers.And the time before this I found hair in my avacado egg rolls . Thats how you know I loved it .. I went back after that haha . I tried  the lasagna and ""chefs "" failed me. These prices id expect fresh.. its not fast food it shouldn\'t be frozen.. or have that cheap of meat just leave the meat out."
Gabriel C.,Sacramento  CA,288,58,49,9/13/2015,5.0,I always love coming here. Great food  drinks  and desserts! The staff is always super friendly and welcoming. Their happy hour is to die for. Come and enjoy the great atmosphere!
Nicki C.,Yuba City  CA,0,14,5,5/1/2015,5.0,Megan was AMAZING! Very sweet and on top of it. Best service we have had at a BJ's. We will be back for her friendly red headed smiles and great service!
Gena S.,Sacramento  CA,0,14,15,5/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I am updating my review because before we left  the manager came up to us. We didn't call him over or anything  he was following up on the salad he had heard about from the cook manager. He tried to make it right by offering us a gift card to come back and try the restaurant. We will try it again with the card in hopes that it is better. The not only 1 but 2 servers we had that night still were horrible though.
Michelle L.,Sacramento  CA,794,715,4307,4/14/2015,4.0,"Came in for dinner as part of a fundraiser for Food Literacy Center (15% of food sales) and tried the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi entree off of the enlightened menu. Oven roasted  glazed mahimahi served over stirfried veggies and roasted pineapple fried rice  mixed with a soy-ginger sauce. Topped with slivered snow peas  red bell peppers and sesame seeds. Was pretty tasty! Of course after having a ""\'light"" entre  I skipped appetizers and beer and instead shared a mini Pizookie trio with the rest of the table. No more red velvet flavor but we did get salted caramel  chocolate chip  and triple chocolate. Yummy. There\'s a BJ\'s closer to me in Natomas  or Elk Grove  depending on where I find myself  but it was nice to have a non-pizza option (although the flatbreads looked pretty good too)."
Karen T.,Elk Grove  CA,600,212,1084,7/20/2014,4.0,"My friends and I came here after the California State Fair since it was nearby and didn\'t close until late. The place was still fairly busy when we arrived around 1100PM. I ordered a peachberry iced tea mocktail that was pretty darn yummy. For my main meal  I tried the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon which I really enjoyed! The glaze for the salmon was sweet and was paired with tangy flavored couscous. Slightly odd combination for my taste buds  but I enjoyed it overall since the meal was ""light"" (as opposed to a ""heavy"" pasta) yet was still very filling. For dessert  I shared the Cookies \'n\' Cream pizookie with 3 other people which was the bomb! I love BJ\'s pizookies and Cookies \'n\' Cream is now definitely my favorite one! Service was a little unattentive  but it looked like our waiter was covering a lot of other tables during our time there. Not too shabs."
Sara B.,Rancho Cordova  CA,174,167,142,2/1/2014,5.0,"We stopped by BJ\'s on a Wednesday afternoon after doing some shopping. It was just our luck that they happened to have $5.95 lunch specials going on. I ordered their Enlightened Chicken Tacos (corn tortillas filled with fajita marinated chicken breast  topped with cabbage  Baja sauce and pico de gallo; served with black beans and a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and jalapeo pickled carrots and onions.)It was pretty busy inside for a week day  so we decided to sit at the bar. Our food seriously seemed like it took forever to come out and by the time it did  I was starving! One look at my plate and I felt disappointed because my tacos looked tiny  like street tacos style! But  they always say when you\'re hungry your eyes are bigger than your stomach and that proved to be true. For lunch  I felt these tacos ended up being the perfect size. They were savory and had a really nice flavor to them; I especially liked the Baja sauce that was inside. As for the shredded cabbage  it didn\'t really taste ""tangy"" to me and I couldn\'t pick up on the the taste of the jalapeo pickled carrots and onions. The side of black beans and the few chips it came with were a nice touch. I left BJ\'s feeling quite satisfied and loving that my meal only cost $5.95."
Paula J.,Paso Robles  CA,115,18,15,5/11/2016,1.0,Waitress was good  but we have never had such over cooked calamari!! Chewy and hard... Nasty!
Jennifer T.,Davis  CA,26,57,102,5/19/2014,4.0,"Came here for a friends farewell party with about 30 people! The staff at BJ were very accommodating with our party. We had multiple waitress to take orders  refill drinks  and check in on us. For a really large group they were very patient and calm. Atmosphere at BJs is nice  kinda dim though. Place is lively  lots of people chatting. Okay now back to the main reason for this review  the food! I heard BJs were famous for their pizzas  so I got the hand-tossed ""BJs Favorite"" pizza. On the pizza was housemade meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green bell peppers  black olives and white onions. So much meat! I really enjoyed the pizza. The individual size is definitely filling!! If you are a meat lover  try this pizza. I enjoyed the hand-toss pizza because there wasn\'t too much dough. It was really crispy. A few of my friends got the deep dish pizza  but it looked more like a thick crusted pizza  not a true deep dish pizza. The pizza was kinda pricey though  but it is kinda expected for a restaurant like this. I probably won\'t come here if I was craving a pizza because I can go to other places for cheaper  but it would be nice to come here once in a while for a nicer experience."
Anthony C.,Sacramento  CA,9,3,,12/4/2015,5.0,Great food. I had the ribs was best I've had ina while.. wife had the steak was a little bland but was still great with some a1. Waiters are friendly and got seated fast for beeIng by a Friday.. drinks never left empty. For the ammount of food the prices where great. kid got the kids pizza was big thick and soft. Tasted good. We will defiantly come back again.Forgot.I had there chillie. Was awsome.
Emily M.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,1,12/2/2016,4.0,I always order BJ's on my lunch break because it's fast and convenient. Today I ordered online about 20 mins before my lunch. Got to the takeout area and my order hadn't even been started or showing up on the computer. The girl working  Abby  said that it does happen a lot from ordering online. She quickly took my order  asked if I needed anything to drink while I waited and sincerely apologized. I just wanted to give her a shout out because I was about to say never mind on the order but she really went out of her way to get me my food quickly! Thanks Abby! :)
Alyssa Mae C.,Sacramento  CA,33,247,34,6/24/2015,4.0,Consistently good! I might order the soup and salad to stay on the lighter side  but I always steal a bunch of yummy string fries from my husband's massive double deluxe burger dish ;) Birthday pizookies are awesome  too!
Cassie B.,Rancho Cordova  CA,15,47,39,9/3/2016,1.0,"I\'ve been here on previous occasions and had great service.. came in last night and I was dressed down  probably should\'ve just went with take out.. The server treated my table like he wasn\'t getting tipped  probably because the way we ""looked"". Ordered an appetizer with waters... then we ordered food after the fact.. food came out burger was fresh  the chicken club and fries were cold and stale.....and the appetizer was no where to be found. they bring the appetizer and we send back the chicken club sandwich... Came time for the bill & we were charged two chicken club sandwiches on it. The manager at the time just said sorry  they removed one of the two chicken club sandwiches  and went about her day.. stood there for minutes before someone in my party started yelling to get some service so we could do the right thing  pay and leave. The general manager received a call today... Nick handled it well and just heard me out. He offered a comp/gift card  plot twist it\'s not about the money it\'s about the concept that we were discriminated against because the way we looked. Keep your comp card  I\'ll pay for what we received  but you will lose my business. and hopefully yours too. If you don\'t look like you\'re gonna tip go somewhere and get consistent service across the board."
Maybeline C.,Sacramento  CA,36,138,88,3/14/2016,4.0,This is my spot for some late night pizookies ! I usually come here at night with friends to just eat and catch up since its a good place for a late night dining with friends. I like there clam chowder bread bowls  deep dish pizzas  and the flat breads a lot. My favorite flat bread is the california club because its so good and the size is pretty decent whether its being ordered as an appetizer for the whole table or a light entree for yourself. They also have a lot of other different types of flat breads to choose from too. The deep dish pizzas are also really good too especially the chicken bacon ranch one! The service at night is okay  its just that they're not as attentive since i think theres less workers at night but its still good. My favorite part is the pizookie because its so good especially when they had the red velvet one! Overall this is a pretty decent place to dine and hangout with friends.
Dionne T.,Sacramento  CA,204,110,996,6/11/2015,3.0,Came here on Sunday nite to celebrate the MILs Bday. We all ordered our own pizzas.....that's our typical order when coming to BJs. I went w/the Chicken Bacon Ranch which was tasty. MIL had never eaten at BJs before (how can that be??) so she went w/a custom order pizza w/mushrooms  asparagus  & one other topping.....chicken perhaps? She said it was good but the asparagus was a bit hard. Now the hubs.......who's favorite pizza is a bacon cheeseburger pizza: bacon w/ground beef. So  ground beef technically isn't a listed topping  altho I think it used to be. Anyways  he knows that they have sirloin for their burgers & at some locations they will use that meat & put it on his pizza. However  some locations do not. On this particular occasion  my hubby asked (because they've done so at this location in the past) but was disappointed when told he wouldn't be able to order it. VERY upset & quite disappointed that he had to order pepperoni instead. He was not a happy camper  to say the least. All-in-all  the food was still quite yummy  as per usual.We also ordered their triple pazookie platter for dessert. You can't go wrong when ordering a pazookie. & For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about  let me edge-ah-muh-cate you on it real quick. Basically you get a freshly baked  still in the cooking dish  warm & gooey cookie topped w/a scoop of ice cream! Dessert doesn't get much better than that. They have a variety of cookie types to choose from: I went w/the white chocolate chip & macadamia nut. I think the others in my party chose chocolate chip & triple chocolate  which is a chocolate cookie w/chocolate chips. My MIL  who ordered the chocolate chip cookie requested chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. When the pazookies arrived to our table  they were VERY gooey....in fact  I'd say they were basically uncooked in the center. Not really what you should expect  as the cookie really should be cooked all the way through. Even though the cookie was not cooked all the way  who doesn't love eating cookie dough? Which means I still ate it all up!!Overall  the food was good. The service wasn't bad  but it wasn't stellar either. I would still come here occasionally  but the hubby said he doesn't think he'll come to this location anymore.....mostly due to the no ground beef on his pizza thing.
Amanda C.,Sacramento  CA,75,2,5,5/26/2016,1.0,gluten free people: if you avoid gluten  avoid this bj's. they gave me raw cookie dough. they do not know how to cook gluten free food. avoid the stomachache & the shits.
Meraje S.,Vacaville  CA,9,36,30,12/28/2015,1.0,"Negative 5 stars! I wish I could rate negative stars on here....Worst service ever... Even the manager Amy or Aimee is rude and had no customer service skills... She basically told me and my friends we were lying...I always come to this location and usually it\'s ok.But this time we for this server (male) don\'t know his name but he shouldn\'t be a server He was already annoyed with us when we ordered Because we wanted to make changes to our order. Anyway food room forever and it didn\'t even come out correct. Next they didn\'t refill our waters and we asked for our check they took forever and we asked for water refills and the check  the server walked by us a few times no refill or check so we decided to get up and go to the front counter and pay.... Which finally the server walked our check up to us and walked away... So no we want to pay and no one is at the register so a lady walks up and she\'s like ""can I help you"" we said we want to pay and leave and then she asks ""is everything ok  I\'m the manager"" And we start to tell her what happen and we tell her we come here all the time which we really do at least 3 times a week... Then the ""manager"" says I\'m here 5 days a week and I never see you guys here! What kind of response is that? She\'s basically is saying we are lying.... And she wants to argue with us... We next said excuse me what did you say we really come in here all the time Then we ask for her name and aggressively she says Amy! And spells it out for us A-M-Y!I was so disgusted I couldn\'t believe this was the manager talking to customers like that.... I will not go back here again.... I know bjs is a chain and probably won\'t read this but I still wanted to let people know what kind of business this and what kind of management they have going on."
Ryan B.,Burlington  VT,15,72,1,1/13/2016,5.0,Love BJ's Brewhouse. Never pass an opportunity to grab a cold beer  and some excellent food  when I'm in the area. Never disappoint.
Stephanie D.,Sacramento  CA,1,14,,2/17/2015,1.0,"I\'ve always been pleased with this place as a go to spot for drinks and late night appetizers. They definitely have that down to a \'T\'. I think I\'ll avoid it as an option for a full on dinner  though.Went in on a Wednesday for a birthday. We were put at a super tiny table for six people. With all of the advertising stuff they have on the tables  there really isn\'t any room to put anything. We brought two bottles of wine with us. The server asks if we brought a wine opener. (Yeah  no). A couple minutes later she returns with a wine key and glasses. I\'m thinking she is going to open our wine for us. Nope. She just hands my boyfriend the wine key and says ""here ya go!"" and walks away.  We ended up opening the bottles ourselves which  heads up to management  I think might be border-line illegal...? Even if it isn\'t  I can open my own wine at home and not be charged a $7 corkage fee. Once the food came  everyone\'s but mine came out. When I asked her about it she went to go check. She came back about 5 minutes later stating that it would be about 5 more minutes because the kitchen ran out of pasta. Having work in a restaurant  myself  I know that was pretty much code for ""I forgot to ring in your food  but I\'m going to blame it on the kitchen so you don\'t think it\'s my fault and hopefully save my tip"". My food finally came about 10 awkward minutes later. It was tasty  but nothing to write home about. Like I said  great for late night snacks and drinks at the bar. Sit down restauraunt? I\'ll probably head next door to Seasons 52."
Alexandra R.,Sacramento  CA,59,158,184,6/21/2015,4.0,We go to BJ's often because they have great food. We usually have good service at the Arden location too! We walked into the restaurant and decided to sit in the bar area because there was a wait for the restaurant. We tried to order some beers but they were our of the one we wanted so the server brought us a taste of something similar. I thought that was a nice thing for him to do. We ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer and I had the ahi tuna salad. The avocado egg rolls were really good but the ahi tuna was just alright. I enjoyed the salad part! We will continue to come back to this location because of the great beer selection and delicious food.
Jaclyn L.,Sacramento  CA,16,32,2,2/14/2016,5.0,Went in for a Valentine's Day lunch and it was surprisingly wait free! Service was AWESOME! I've been to other BJ's Restaurant & this one has been by far the best. I was really surprised how fast and great the service was  especially on V-Day!
W. A.,Sacramento  CA,2,20,2,12/26/2015,1.0,I've given this restaurant many chances and all chances have been disappointing. The service sucks beyond belief. We just came back from here. Surprisingly they weren't busy for a Saturday. Got there around 1:30. Took literally 10 minutes before someone came over and greeted me. My husband and daughter joined me. After another 10 minutes our drink order was taken. Seriously took about another 10 minutes to get mine and my daughters drink. She told us the beer would be right up.. How hard was it to pout some beer from a tap in a glass? Ok... Whatever. Food took 45 minutes to come out. It's just ridiculous how long they take to greet you  get you drinks  and get you your food. I've never had good service at the Natomas location. That was it.. That was the last chance. With so many other dining options will not be attending this BJ's again.
Brian T.,Arden-Arcade  Sacramento  CA,74,26,,8/23/2015,3.0,"First time at this particular location.The staff was very upfront from the time we were seating that they were in the middle of a shift change  and that bar items would be delayed slightly because they were backed up  as they told our table and every table around us (new tables and guests in the middle of their meal).Ordered a layered beer  and when it arrived I couldn\'t tell if the two beers had been poured incorrectly and instantly mixed together... or if only the darker beer had been poured by itself.Sent the beer back  ordered another craft beer and it tasted flat. Finished it and ordered a different craft beer and enjoyed it.My food was delicious (chicken pizza). My wife\'s fish and chips tasted over done  and her ""crispy"" fries were soggy.Server remained very attentive and checked in on us frequently.I\'d be willing to try the location again and hope the couple of things were just due to an off night."
Jake V.,Littleton  CO,19,419,195,1/14/2016,3.0,Busy place since its at Arden mall. The staff was friendly and nice. The food was good and it is plenty for dinner. I thought the chicken pita tacos were good but ordered fries with them instead of what the usual side is.
Erika P.,South Lake Tahoe  CA,136,6,5,5/17/2016,1.0,Sssoooo gross! :( This is my third time eating here and it still disappoints. It's a bummer  especially since I live down the street. The service is always great  but the food is so awful. Tonight I ordered some food to go  just some munchies appetizers and once I got Home & opened the bag I knew I shouldn't have tried them again :(
Mo T.,Sacramento  CA,84,16,1,12/28/2015,1.0,I've loved this BJ's for years  and it's always been one of my favorites  me and my cousin frequent this location 2-3 times a week. We stopped going to Elk Grove for the reason of bad service. Soo it all started with our order from the beginning. We asked for extra chicken not a crazy request obviously at a extra charge. Our server didn't seem to like that. So only three waters at a table of four  not logical but maybe the fourth one was coming. Hmm no it wasn't. Let's kindly request. Oh yea I'll get one right now. Few mins goes by i see our server walk by a few times. No water. Hmm okay! One salad comes out all alone without the extra chicken. Maybe it's coming with the other salads  all the other salads roll out no extra chicken and still no water. Server walks by I'm checking on that extra chicken I sarcastically say thanks for the water. Oh I'm sooo sorry I'll bring it out now. He comes back finally with a pitcher to refill the other waters. Hmm excuse me but I have no cup  still no extra chicken we are done eating and now ask for the bill in pure annoyance. 10-15 mins pass with him telling us he is trying to get the extra chicken taken off because only a manager can do it. We are beyond unhappy and go to front to try to pay. Oh sorry sir you can't pay here we will try to get your check. 5 mins past finally a check. We proceed to pay up front. Then a manager by the name of Amy  approaches us and asks us is everything okay? Out of frustration we respond actually it's not. We come here a lot at least 3 times a week. Her response is I work 5 days a week I've never seen you here. Is 3 times a week not enough? Even if it was my first time that is a not a response I expected from someone of a manager position. I then proceeded to ask for her name and she decided to spell it out! A-M-Y or AMIE! Her loud tone of voice and border line screaming was heard to really grasp the exact letters! Wow bad service from the server and the manager. I'm not surprised because BAD SERVICE COMES FROM BAD MANAGEMENT. Please save yourself the humiliation and feeling as if your presence isn't appreciated and visit another BJs or avoid this entire chain of restaurants as Amy has left me no option. No food is good enough to have to go through this type of service. And that my fellow yelpers is how BJ's has earned my very first 1 star review.
Cecilia T.,Galt  CA,2,4,2,11/16/2015,2.0,"I enjoy BJ\'s for their Happy Hour special (2pm-5pm)...Their Mojitos  Lemon Drop  and dark selection of beer are great  plus decent appetizers. However  coming in here at any other time is disatisfying. It had been a while since I had visited  and my morning work meeting had just ended; my coworker and I were starving. Decided to come in for their ""Weekend Brunch"" ...worse idea ever. My food took foooreveeerrr to come. French toast was small  eggs and sausage cold  and wasn\'t offered a second Mimosa (still delicious) until I was ready to leave. Waitress was friendly  but more occupid with other guests. The meal and experience wasn\'t worth the $16.00."
Jennifer T.,Sacramento  CA,20,147,13,2/27/2016,1.0,I really hate to give negative reviews  but this was by far THE WORST experience I've ever had at a BJ's EVER!! The service was horrendous! Our server came to our table right away to take our drink order and as we were waiting for our drinks  other tables that came in after we did got their drinks a good 5 to 10 minutes before we did. And the same goes for our food. Once we got our food  our server came back only once to check on how our food was and asked if we wanted another drink. When we asked for water  they were dropped off at our table without a word. The fish and chips I ordered were over cooked to the point of being almost burnt. When we asked for boxes  she returned a short time later with them and tossed them on our table and again no words spoken. And instead of dropping off our check when she brought over our boxes  she walked away as if she were expecting us to order dessert even after we told her we were not. There were no thank yous or any other words spoken at a higher than a mumble.Overall  I have never been so disappointed in the service or food at this establishment in my life. Even though I will never go back to this particular location  I will have to put up with driving further to other locations.
DaFoodCritic F.,Sioux City  IA,18,33,51,3/10/2016,2.0,Had it for the first time several months ago. The food was pretty good as well as their prices for what you get. I just had an issue with our server. He wasn't the greatest  he was kind of friendly but didn't pay much attention to us or even came around often to see if we were doing okay. He even forgot to bring a cup of milk we ordered for a toddler that was with us. We had to keep reminding him  asking for napkins  and also for refill on drinks. Was not the most pleasant experience.
Dawn C.,Sacramento  CA,5,16,,10/5/2016,2.0,Walked in and service was snarky. Was told they were honoring a special  but at time of payment  they said they were not.
Veronica S.,Sacramento  CA,131,276,405,4/5/2014,2.0,4 stars for the food. 2-3 for the service. It's really a hit or miss but lately they've been slacking. Most of the time I go here with my friend and we usually never have to wait to be seated or the wait is really short which is nice. However last time after we were seated it took over 10 minutes for our waitress to get to us. I had to go up to the hostess and inform her. When I did she just glanced at our table and mumbled something like ohh ok. No apology or anything. Our waitress was ok. Our drinks were never refilled though which was annoying. Food took awhile too. Appetizers came out quickly but the main dishes took over 20 minutes. Love that BJ's has a pay on your phone option now. We weren't even thinking of using it but since our waitress was taking forever with our check we ended up using it anyways. I guess I just find it weird that every time I go here and have bad service it's never extremely busy which could explain the delay on the food. Having worked in retail hell for two years I know that it really sucks dealing with people sometimes. I always try my best to be polite when dealing with people that work in the service industry but some things there's just no excuse for.
Ames A.,San Jose  CA,166,104,162,11/30/2013,2.0,I came in on a Sunday night  and was quickly ushered to the bar (although I wanted a table because I walked in with books planning to finish up some studying and grab a bite). It took about 10-15 minutes to get menus and drinks.. I had to wave down the bartender in order to do so. Bartender was nice and caught by surprised the fact we had no menus and nobody had really helped us  in other words service is a bit lacking.The decor is your usual BJs  filled with high chairs  TVs  and a young crowd.Now for the foodavacado egg rolls (6$ for happy hour) they were crunchy and filled with avacado goodness.Shrimp Scampi (16$) flavorless and blandseared ahi tuna salad (15) The sauce they used was flavorfull and yummy. We both drank water so I'm not so sure how our bill came out to 45$  we paid and left and will probably not be back anytime for this mediocre food...
Yolanda H.,East Oakland  Oakland  CA,119,7,2,11/3/2015,1.0,I'm don't live out here so I'm sure I won't ever come back to this location but I felt compelled to write a review anyway. I'm beyond positive I got food poisoning from eating here. I felt sick a few ours after eating my meal and I was in the bathroom for two days after eating at this BJ's. The worst part about this entire episode was that I was on a business trip  so I had to continue with my business while running to my room to use the restroom every couple hours....DON'T EAT HERE!!!
Tianna W.,Sacramento  CA,162,210,489,1/19/2015,3.0,Been here once in the past. I remember the pizzas me and a group of people ordered individually were commonly dry  but still tasted. I went there today and had the lunch chicken taco plate. Very small as I was told but good with a side of beans. Initially  it took the server sometime to get to my table but she was nice. The lunch taco plate wasnt very light or heavy  it was just right for the occasion.
Katelynn B.,Gold River  CA,34,5,2,6/19/2015,5.0,I come for the Pizookie! That is the best part of the meal! Granted the food here is great too. I like the Parmesan crusted chicken. I've frequented a few locations and they've a been great  but I gotta tell you it's pizookie heaven for me.
Crystal C.,Sacramento  CA,297,418,685,8/13/2013,3.0,I had a shockingly good time here  but my expectations were low to begin with.I was stuck at the mall because I needed my iPhone serviced at the Apple store. Which is more complicated and time consuming than it ought to be  and resulted in my boyfriend and I having to wait for my appointment (they're always running behind)  then emerging starving and stressed from the Apple store a while later. We needed food and booze stat  and Hot Dog on a Stick was not going to cut it.We were told it a table would be ready in five minutes  which actually turned out to be over ten minutes. We hardly noticed because we'd already cruised over to the bar and had pints in hand by the time our buzzer went off. Can we take a moment to appreciate their beer selection? Just  wow. What isn't available on their wall o' taps is available in bottles. Plus  Rogue Dead Guy on tap? Keep 'em coming.We ordered the watermelon and feta cheese appetizer salad  which came after we'd been seated at our table. The salad was delicious and I plan to swing by and get it again next time I'm in the mall.I ordered the blackened salmon with white wine and butter sauce dinner with rice pilaf  steamed veggies  and chicken tortilla soup. You get a lot of food for the price  but it's just too much food. Unless you're starving or sharing  get something light or something that will make food leftovers. The chicken tortilla soup was interesting because the waitress arrived with a shallow bowl with a handful of multicolored tortilla chip shreds and sliced avocado in the bottom and asked if I had the soup. Um  yes  but that is not soup. It was then I noticed the little metal pitcher in her other hand. She put the bowl down and poured the broth portion of the soup over the tortilla shred and avocado. At first I thought it was weird  then realized it was genius. Done that way  the tortilla shreds are still crunchy and the avocado is still cold when you start eating  which has changed chicken tortilla soup for me forever. If I'm in the mall I will be stopping by for another bowl of this soup.I was pretty much full by the time the actual meal arrived  but took a few more bites of everything. The salmon was good but unremarkable. The white wine and butter sauce was very rich and good at first  but cooled down quickly and kind of congealed. Yuckers. The pilaf was bland and the steamed veggies were a tad overdone and had no butter or sauce or anything. Meh. I'm not sure I would order that dish again.The service was friendly but  as others have stated  a bit slow. The atmosphere was a bunch of families and people escaping the hustle and bustle of the mall. Noise level was a dull roar  but you could still hear what the person across the table was saying. Considering my anxiety level at malls and disdain of the food court  I know I'll be back for a pint  the watermelon feta salad  and a bowl of soup next time I'm at Arden Mall. I will probably sit at the bar next time.
Sarah J.,Sacramento  CA,9,51,156,4/17/2015,5.0,I have been to all the BJs locations in Sacramento. This one is my favorite. Their food and service are always good and consistent. A little slow on busy nights but always worth the wait and the atmosphere that the staff help creat is great for a fun night out or relaxing lunch.
Jamaica S.,Sacramento  CA,30,38,15,10/31/2014,1.0,"My husband and I tried this place about a year ago   I ordered the Mahi Mahon tacos he got the chicken sandwich. It\'s kinda hard to mess up a fish taco. It took about 30 min for our food to arrive during lunch hour  we tried to sneak a day date in wo. the kids. It grew frustrating to see people who arrived after me eating before me  it wasn\'t a complicated order or anything. Mahi Mahi tacos; 1 fried 1 grilled. Fried fish tastes frozen fish sticks put in grease (they were burnt  but I was starving). The grilled one was bland and flavorless. A creamy ""guacamole-like"" dipping sauce  tasted like avocados and mayo mixed (yuck) the salsa was the basic jar variety (pace if I\'m not mistaken)Best part was my strawberry lemonade. The waitresstried her best was does the waitstaff ever taste the food? ??Fried chicken sandwich; nicely Fried and seasoned chicken breast on a grilled roll  my husband said he\'d try it again  for him that\'s saying alot.Take 2 today; while at the mall hunger struck my two kids down for the count  I considered BJ\'s again letting bygones be bygones plus the kids wanted to try the Pizookie (why is there no Sniderdoddle pizookie?? whoever turned that idea down should\'ve been fired places like c.r.e.a.m are selling the combo of snikerdoodle and ice cream and are making a killing)my husband was in the process if upgrading my kids\' phones and we were hungry so this time we decide to only order appetizers while we waited for him. this proved to be a not so good idea as I ended up just paying for the starters tipping and leaving.the sampler plate comes with an assortment of different Lil fried bites none of them out shined the other at all  the artichoke dip needed something salty in it to balance out the creaminess. there were avocado rolls (the nastiness creamier most oddest made edible thing ever) it lacked any sort of substance to hold it together so it was like biting into fried bland guacamole wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. stuffed mushrooms; spinach and cheese topped with parm. these were okay too  I just wish someone who really knew how to cook and season food worked there  it had the potential for something great but it missed the mark only in seasoning. I looked at the menu for about 20 min before deciding this place wasn\'t worth trying an entree. we booked it out of there quick  smh"
Addison M.,Sacramento  CA,1376,373,401,3/2/2015,4.0,It's a good location the parking is very crammed and tight you might have to get valet parking if you want to get food at a decent hour or come later in the evening
Audrey C.,Sacramento  CA,0,8,,3/3/2016,4.0,I love this place  everything on the menu is delicious  my favorite is the oreo poozookie . Yum lol
E T.,Sacramento  CA,0,27,45,2/21/2016,2.0,Been here twice. Each time an order was subpar. Alcohol and cookie desserts are good.
Lynn J.,Sacramento  CA,28,66,22,1/3/2015,5.0,I have been here a couple of times and I always have a positive experience. Never waited over ten minutes for a table and the staff is always friendly and on top of things. The Parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy. Served with potatoes and broccoli. The giant baked potatoes are great and super filings. You can never go wrong with the pizza either.
Helen B.,Sacramento  CA,10,118,233,2/4/2015,4.0,First time in this place like any other BJ's it's noisy but this one is better. I ordered the chicken wrap and it was the bomb for tonight
Lawrence B.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,,1/18/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"The meal started out pretty well  as my party of four got a table for lunch with no waiting. Our waitress was a nice young brunette who brought water quickly. Then the trouble began.After choosing what to order  it took the waitress 20 minutes to notice we were waiting for her. And it was another 25 minutes for the food to arrive!My clam chowder was very good  and my burger was great. My date\'s French Dip was mediocre (her words) at best. Her sandwich had almost no cheese  and the bread was inedible. My buddy\'s fries were only lukewarm. Following the meal  our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert. We decided to split a Pikoozie (ice cream & cookie)  and then proceeded to wait forty-five (45) minutes. Our dessert plate and spoons arrived  but no food to go with it! Furthermore  the waitress seemed to be avoiding us. Being left waiting is bad enough  but being clueless about the state of your order is inexcusable!Time was ticking down  and my buddy had to catch the train to San Francisco. Finally  we spotted the waitress and I physically intercepted her and told her to forget the dessert and just bring the check. It was only then--amidst hurried apologies--that she admitted the cook had made the wrong dessert and that she\'d had to instruct him to make the right one! A little communication to us might have been nice!After a fifteen minute wait we got the check. I was tempted to leave my ""pointed insult tip"" (1/2 a penny)  but I gave her the benefit of a doubt and left two dollars and change. On the way out I stopped to use the bathroom. The overhead speakers were blasting music at 105 decibels (according to my sound-meter app)  and the echo effect was terrible! The men\'s room was clean and nicely decorated  but you\'d better bring shooting plugs to save your ears! That is not what a restroom should be like!This place looks like it will be a great experience  but don\'t be fooled. There is a lot of room for improvement!"
Cari Y.,Berkeley  CA,76,46,29,4/16/2015,5.0,First time here since it opened up. I went with my siblings after church and it was just an amazing experience. I got to catch up with my siblings over good food. Could it get any better? We had pasta which wasn't all that - Chicken alfredo. However my sister ordered a flatbread yada yada (forgot what it was) and it was delicious! I am a big fan of anything similar to pizza  in shape or form  and it was tasty. Also had the strawberry freckled lemonade thingy and it was a little too sweet but just added some of my water to it and made it perfect. Service isn't great nor bad.
Carl Vincent C.,Sacramento  CA,477,122,332,6/14/2011,2.0,Definitely not what I was expecting from BJ's.Long story short: the service was terrible. The hostesses seemed annoyed & painfully bored while seating me and my friends. Our waitress barely checked up on us too. It took nearly an hour to receive our food. & we ordered sandwiches.
Jeremy T.,Forest Hill  TX,325,21,3,2/13/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Our server Keya B. was phenomenal! So informative  and welcoming. The Deep Dish Ziti was delicious! We had such a great time! I enjoy BJ's atmosphere! We were just and a layover and I'm glad we choose to stop in and eat! Great place  amazing food!
Jack H.,Sacramento  CA,1,8,,3/2/2017,2.0,Ok I was in there today with my family we waited about 15 minutes to get seated. When we got to our table the server greeted us and gave us our menu. He came back after 5 minutes to take our drink order and we ordered appetizers. I'll say after 15-20 minutes our drinks came with the appetizers. Then another 15 minutes past by and the server came back to take our orders. We waited about 30 to 35 minutes for our dinner orders to come. We had kids with us. Then finally our dinner was being served. Wait we had no place settings  like I had to ask for them. How did the server think we were going to eat our dinner? With our hands?? Our little ones ordered pasta  it came with spoons  like why would you give spoons with pasta.. I was kinda lost. It wasn't that busy for Thursday. I've been to other restaurants where it was 2x busier and servers had it under control. Anyhow we waited a long time for our dinner. The server didn't really apologize for their slow service on a Thursday night. I don't think I'll be dining at this BJ'S at arden anymore. I think they should retrain their staff  hire better cooks. I gave 2 stars cause the food and drinks was alright...
Trevor A.,Sacramento  CA,96,120,12,12/30/2013,4.0,"The most efficient BJ\'s I\'ve ever been in. 20 minute wait tops for a table the Saturday night after Christmas in the busiest mall in town? INCREDIBLE service! Managed to find a two seat table in the bar area in less than FIVE minutes. Takes longer to park and actually walk to the place than to sit down generally.Servers & bussers are quick and attentive without hovering. Food is still kind of run of the mill overall BUT there are some gems on the menu. Had the Buffalo whatever it\'s called stout/IPA concoction which is by far the tastiest thing they do with their beers. Goes EXCELLENT with fish & chips  the ribs or any of the Italian dishes with marinara.This go around I had the full rack of ribs for $20. Came with one steak side & soup or salad. Went with the horseradish mashed & chili which was offered as a soup. The chili was okay with some shredded cheddar and a nice amount of sour cream on top but tasted canned. I can live with that although it\'s not beans. The horseradish mashed was EXCELLENT. The ribs were an actual full rack that only costs $3 more than a half rack. Cooked perfectly for a chain that doesn\'t smoke them. The sauce was also perfectly done. I prefer a dry rub but can live with sauce if it\'s not opened floodgates.The date for the evening had a spicy meatball pizza on the regular crust. Neither of us like the tomato chunks so we went without them. Could\'ve used some olive oil in its place because it made the crust sort of dry. BUT the spicy meatballs and jalapenos were a joy.Second good experience in this location has it officially in the ""places to eat when in the Arden area"" list here."
larissamorn b.,Marysville  CA,17,78,10,10/29/2015,4.0,After my lunch fiasco (the nearly empty sandwich from Nordstrom) I used BJ'S app to order the ahi poke to go. Huge portion size was unexpected and much appreciated making the $12 (including tip) tab well worth it. Fish was sloppily cut but fresh as can be and the marinade and wonton chips were on point. Nice guy at the takeout counter  too. Order was ready on time and I'm pretty pleased with my experience.
Steph G.,Sacramento  CA,557,789,1237,6/15/2011,4.0,The Peanut Butter Pizookie is SEX IN YOUR MOUTH!! It brings deliciousness to a whole new level... I want to have babies with the Chef/Ower/Creator of pizookies. I've tried almost all flavors  with the exception of the oatmeal version (just personal preference). Each one has been almost as climactic as the Peanut Butter  but not quite. All you big chain haters  get off your high horse and get into one of these bad boys (rant over)! There is a plethora of decisions on the menu (Cheese Cake Factory-esque). But  do be warned (the missing star) that their service is what you'd expect from a big chain. But to me  if you do a cost-benefit analysis...Pizookie wins every time. Few have tried to imitate  and all have failed. All of the locations in the surrounding Sacramento area have been consistently good with food  but that little part about their service holds true! Peanut butter deserves its own food group  just sayin....
Amanda L.,San Diego  CA,79,17,6,2/9/2016,4.0,I haven't been to a BJ's in years and the wait is normally a deterrent but recently we stopped in for a late night bite and I was shocked at how much the menu has changed. We tried the Brussel sprout appetizer and it was great!! I recommend that for sure. I also had the Chicken Sandwich and it was a hit. If you don't mind a 30 minute wait then check them out.
Valerie F.,Rancho Cordova  CA,0,7,,4/10/2015,5.0,Well  I was really nervous about going here after all the horrid reviews that I read. However  they deserve 5 stars  for sure. We did curbside  but we arrived too late and had to go in. They didn't tell us this over the phone  but the guy was new and nervous. He had assisted us over the phone  very well. He made sure that we were getting what we wanted and apologized a bunch. He was extremely kind. When we went in  they apologized for the inconvenience and he thanked us for being so patient with him and offered us a couple of free drinks. We ended up with two strawberry lemonades  chicken alfredo  and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. We couldn't have made a better choice for take out dinner tonight.
Jennifer H.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,,3/11/2016,5.0,Best pizza ever!!!! Awesome customer service!!! If you love pizza you must go there!!! Try the sweet pig pizza THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!
Erica C.,Anchorage  AK,828,261,3017,3/29/2013,4.0,I haven't had BJ's in a long time. Yesterday  I stopped by here for happy hour since I was craving their pizza. I normally don't go to BJ's because I never really enjoy anything on their menu besides their pizza. Happy hour is the best time to come for their pizza! 50% off all personal pan pizza's so it ends up only being around $5.25 per pizza. My all time fave is the Mediterranean. Nom nom. You must sit in the bar area to get happy hour pricing! We arrived around 5:30pm and there were plenty of seats. They also offer $2 off shareable appetizers and $1 off pints. I had a coupon from the Sunday paper which gave us $5 off $20 all food items. So in addition to our pizzas we ordered a few more dishes. We tried their gourmet mac and cheese and calamari. Both were surprisingly good! I was very satisfied by the time I left.
Brian I.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,1,9/4/2016,1.0,"This place is the worst. I ordered from grubhub.com for a delivery of bj\'s brewhouse. I placed my order at a little after seven. The first email they sent said it would be here (at my house) at a little after eight. That seemed reasonable so I went for it. The next e mail sent said another thirty minutes. The driver then did not show up till eight fifty. Almost two hours after my order was placed. The food was ice cold  and un-edible. We tried to catch the driver but he just speed off. We then called the delivery service  they said bj\'s was responsible for a refund. Then we called bj\'s and they said the delivery service was responsible. Then we learned that there was another party involved by the name of ""Food to you"" and that they were responsible. As of now this has been three days later and no one knows who is responsible. I still have ALL the food from the order and it is starting to smell. I will post pics so you can see. This was a seventy dollar mistake. I have asked for a refund three days in a row  and they just continue to run me around. All three of these places are a joke and I would never ever use these services agin or eat at bj\'s as a restaurant. I would stick with Applebee\'s as they stand behind there food."
Stephanie M.,Sacramento  CA,25,57,21,2/16/2014,4.0,It's February 15th. Day after Valentines day. We head over to Olive Garden but the wait for a party of 2 was about an hour & 15 minutes. & since BJ's is right across the street I decide to call them to see what the wait was. About 25 minutes they said. Off we go to BJ's! We get there & they get my name. I would say about 10 minutes later we got seated. Score! We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip & chips for appetizers. Delicious! I ordered a pomegranate margarita. Oh boy that was strong! I just turned 21 not too long ago so I'm still trying out new drinks. I had to wait until it got watered down with the ice to finish it. The boyfriend ordered the scampi pasta with a piece of grilled chicken added & I ordered the Cajun pasta. The wait for the food was I would say about 20 minutes. Not too long for a typical wait time at BJ's. The garlic bread our pastas came with we're pretty burnt. Neither of us ate them & didn't bother asking for more. My pasta was quite good but it tasted way too much like tomato sauce. It tasted more like spaghetti than Cajun. The boyfriend said his only had the spices on top of the pasta and the bottom was tasteless. Overall  the food was ok. Im giving them such high stars bc for the first time ever our wait time was really short. Like I've said in the past with BJs ratings  they've actually forgot about us.The portion sizes are huge. I maybe ate half my pasta.
Shay L.,Sacramento  CA,124,21,9,10/6/2015,5.0,I usually experience terrible to mediocre customer service whenever I go out to eat  but our waiter Michael was absolutely great. He constantly checked on us even with how busy it was. He never made my friend and me feel like a nuisance. I've never had such great service at BJ's in my life.
Timothy B.,Murrieta  CA,16,4,17,8/29/2015,1.0,Worst hoist I have encountered at BJ's. She tells us that we will be seated right away and as we wait we see four other people be seat as soon as the talked to her. Then I asked what did right away mean to her. With a dumb look on her face I said right away was the four people that came in after me and they was seated right away. That's what it means.
Annie S.,Sacramento  CA,15,27,27,10/11/2014,4.0,I know this is a chain restaurant and people have certain expectations. Honestly  I like this place! I like that they have a wide range of kids menu for my little guy to choose from. They also have a light menu for customers who are watching their calories. ...like me. And they have burgers  pizzas and sandwiches for the guys and for groups to share. Overall  they have a little big of everything for reasonable price and good food! Can't beat that - right!
Rachel M.,Sacramento  CA,109,2,3,5/22/2016,1.0,Me and my sister had lunch at BJs at Arden Fair and paid by mobile app and was chased down by the manager thru the mail saying we didn't pay our 46.00 bill image how embraced and upsetting this wasfor us. Come to find out there was a issue with there system. I will never go there again.
Hugh B.,Daytona Beach  FL,368,3,1,1/30/2016,5.0,The Sriracha bacon and chicken mac'n cheese was PHENOMENAL! Our server Keya was great! Great experience.
Tesia J.,Hayward  CA,95,187,21,9/28/2014,4.0,"Super tasty! I had the ribeye and cheesy mashed potatoes with a caprese salad. We also had tuna poke for appetizers (which they pronounced ""poke"" like you poke somebody with your finger. Lol) and a half and half pizzookie. I had salted caramel and my friend had like an Oreo one or something. Every single thing was delicious! The chips and tuna poke were sooooooooo gooodddd! Omgosh! The steak was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were luxurious and the cookie was decadent! I was impressed! Oh and the service was super friendly as well. The only complaint was that pretty much everything except the dessert came out at the same time. Lol.Anyway  I will be going back to try something else! Especially since I didn\'t get to taste any of their beer! (was on the clock!)"
Sophia S.,Rancho Cordova  CA,119,22,17,8/8/2015,1.0,My food was okay  and the service was horrible. It seemed as if our waiter was intentionally avoiding us majority of the night  and made it seem like we were asking for too much when we asked for straws  ketchup  and silverware. Bringing us an empty bottle of ketchup and then after the night when we were leaving  three workers didn't even acknowledge us but just kept giggling and laughing at the front desk. Definitely driving further down sunrise or even Elk Grove next time I go to bj's.
Farzin S.,Irvine  CA,21,47,10,12/23/2015,1.0,Don't get me wrong  I love BJ's food  but honestly will probably never come back to this BJ's. It took our waiter 10+ minutes to bring us our waters. The utensils and one of the wine glasses had food stuck in it(the wine glass was dirty after they poured the wine in it). The waiter was very grumpy and was definitely not happy to be there. It took them about an hour to bring us our food. Despite me asking her to make the steak medium rare  the stake was completely well done  borderline burnt and very hard to swallow. It didn't even come across her to bring me ketchup or dips for my fries and she did not even bother coming by and asking us how our food was. Not very happy with my experience :(
Michael J.,Pleasanton  CA,7,18,10,8/17/2013,5.0,Love their beer. Especially their winning light beer nit-wit. Right temperature at serve. Smell good. Nice nitty taste. The best. I had 3 glass at my dinner tonight. Their pizza is ok. Better than normal pizza joint. Their serve is friendly. Atmosphere is friendly. It's inside a good shopping mall. So  waiting for table is not a problem.
Ashleina R.,Sacramento  CA,26,21,5,10/1/2015,1.0,If Sara is bartending don't sit at the bar. She is impersonal and will hardly acknowledge you. And definitely don't get a mojito from her. It tastes like lemon lime Kool Aid. And don't ask her to remake it  because she won't. She will just add more lime juice. Save yourself the trouble and go across the street to Elephant Bar.
Melissa B.,Davis  CA,40,108,34,2/19/2013,4.0,"Always a fan of BJ\'s. Large variety on the menu  and everything seems to be well prepared. Their giant stuffed potatoes are really good!! They have some fun beers/beer mixtures that are always great to try  my favorite is the Hoppy Buffalo. The pizza is good if you like deep dish  and dont you know you have to have a Pizzookie for dessert?? Its a giant cookie topped with ice cream  and its pretty amazing. Lately I have been ordering 2-3 of the ""small bites""  which are basically appetizers for 1 or 2 people that are cheap! I like variety and being able to mix and match these for the same price as an entree. One of my other favorites is the flatbread  I cant remember which one but it has lots of veggies and feta cheese. Nom.Sign up for their Premier Rewards and you will get a member card that adds the dollar amount of all your visits. Each dollar=1 point  and 100 or more points gets you free stuff. The Sacramento location is located inside Arden Faire Mall  so its a little crowded and parking can be difficult right in front of the restaurant  but the staff is friendly and fast nonetheless."
Gabriel M.,Fresno  CA,4,38,19,6/29/2015,2.0,I've been here several times  food and service is usually good. Last time I went both of our plates weren't good. They were just ok but not typical BJs quality. Kind of disappointing. Food quality not consistent.
Leilani S.,Carmichael  CA,59,10,1,6/7/2015,1.0,Let me first start off by saying this place was a big disappointment the food was nasty. I ordered stuffed ravioli my husband ordered parmesean crusted chicken. Let me say I knew this meal was off to a bad start when the waitress gave me my food and said here is your lasagna  I corrected her and said this is not what I ordered and she told me it's ravioli but they call it lasagna  yea whatever. So back to the moral of the story the food was gross my ravioli was salty and tasted like microwaveable food  canned ravioli taste better then this junk. My husband's food had no flavor horrible experience. The 2 appetizers we ordered were mediocre as well. We spent $98 on 2 appetizers and 3 dishes so not worth the money. Won't ever eat at BJS again.
Petite G.,Roseville  CA,3,17,4,7/20/2014,2.0,"I\'ll start with the summary: Food is ok  service leaves a lot to be desired. Two stars. Not recommended. We won\'t be coming back here.We recently came here with a party of 10 on a weekday. It took them a long while to seat us (45 minutes!) and others who came after us got seated ahead. We patiently waited  since taking a group of 10 people to another restaurant at dinnertime seemed a bit daunting.We finally got our table and put in our orders with a member of the staff  who was friendly enough. While we were waiting for the food to be served  another server came and said that our original server was on break and that he would be taking over. After about half an hour  the food started arriving. Everyone\'s food came except for my hubby\'s entree. When most of the people in our party were halfway through their dishes and his entree still did not arrive  my hubby gently reminded the server about it  and said that he (my hubby) had ordered it at the same time that everyone else in our table ordered their food. The server said that he was going to check with the kitchen  and rushed off. Minutes passed and almost everyone had finished their appetizers and entrees  but still no sign of my hubby\'s entree. So we followed up with the server again. He said that since my hubby just ordered it a few minutes ago  it was still not done. What?! This was a lie by the server  because 1) we ordered it with the rest of the meal and heard it confirmed verbally by the original server and 2) the ""relief server"" heard my hubby say we ordered it a while back  along with everyone else at our table. He (relief server) did not even apologize  and rushed off again. We had to call him back and ask him to check the kitchen. And lo and behold  a few minutes later  he was back with the entree  which was now pretty cold! So  a lying server + poor training = not a good experience.What saved the evening was the fun company and the pizookie. Otherwise  the food is just average  and if we really want chain-restaurant food  we can get more flavorful versions at Chili\'s or The Cheesecafe Factory next time. We were unhappy with the service here  and we will not be back."
Samantha H.,Sacramento  CA,192,92,52,11/16/2015,2.0,"Below average for a BJ\'s Brewhouse restaurant. My soup tasted like it was straight out of the can and my salad was drowned in mediocre ""balsamic vinagarette"". My boyfriend who will eat anything and eats a lot didn\'t even finish his burger because it was too greasy. Our server was good  it was clean and the ambiance was cool. They sat us in a timely manner and we had a decent lunch experience  but the restaurant in Arden is way better and so is the Elk Grove location in the sacramento region."
Stephanie T.,Sacramento  CA,271,434,43,12/29/2012,3.0,I usually come here after a long day of classes at Sac State  and I just want to relax. The service here is always great  which really surprises me since they must deal with a lot of annoying high schoolers from the mall. I love how this place is open late  so if you don't finish class until 9pm  you still have plenty of time to enjoy a nice dinner or Happy Hour. I really enjoy the pizza and burgers here. Those are the two main things I order  besides the Pizookie  of course! The drinks here are always good too. If you're underage  or don't drink alcohol  the Mocktails are nice.
Sandi X.,Sacramento  CA,2,26,1,8/11/2015,2.0,As it was so busy on a Saturday  my sister and I were seated at the bar  which we didn't mind of course until the blonde female bartender started giving my sister attitude. My sister had to get her attention and disrupt her little conversation and then she would glare at us afterwards. She was literally avoiding us the whole entire time and when my sister asked if the lunch specials were on the menu she said well it's in there isn't it? There was a lot of rudeness and I thought it was ironic that the bartender was more friendly to the men than the women who came to sit at the bar. I will go here again but I refuse to sit at the bar again.
Nate M.,Sacramento  CA,18,46,4,8/2/2015,2.0,Seriously... the fish tacos my wife had were just about the worst tacos we've had. My greek tacos were plain and filled with dry chicken. We went around 1 o'clock on Saturday afternoon  so it's not like the place was packed. Probably won't go back.
Nick K.,Sacramento  CA,0,13,1,5/21/2015,1.0,"Went in on Sunday with some friends and the service was absolutely horrific. We ordered and appetizer sampler which everything seemed to be old  stale  and kept warm by a heating lamp. We additionally ordered to orders of wings in different flavors. The second wing I had in one batch was cold still practically frozen in the middle. I advised the waiter and he said it was probably just the one wing and it didn\'t sit deep enough in the fryer when cooking and their distributor fully cooks the wings. He was extemely resistant to bringing a fresh batch. My friend then bites into one from the other order and discovers it is completely pink and uncooked so I asked for the manager. The manager was more useless than the waiter. He was a younger fellow with a trimmed beard. He had no concern for the chicken being undercooked nor our health being put at risk and kept blaming it again on the distributor. I argued with him that it\'s not the distributor because if they receive them fully cooked then they still aren\'t preparing them right because the inside should be warm and white not frozen and pink. He refused to work with us on the bill and only offered to comp the wings. He took the undercooked wing to ""provide feedback"" for his cooks even though we requested to keep it as evidence. I would understand the resistance to comp the meal if it only happened once but for the same mistake to happen twice with two separate batches is completely unacceptable  BJ\'s needs to own up to their mistakes."
Rick J.,West Sacramento  CA,28,45,,5/6/2014,1.0,Went there today for lunch with a couple coworkers and I will never return to this location again! Before I begin  keep in mind they were not busy and the place was over half empty. First  the waiter wanted to sit us right next to the restrooms. We requested another both and were seated. Then we waited and waited and waited. Ten minutes later the waiter arrives to take our drink order only. We all asked for water  waited another ten minutes (how long does it take to get water?)  we were given water then told that the waiter will be back to take our order. The waiter came back about five minutes later took our three orders then we waited another 35 minutes before the food arrived. Because they took so long  our lunch break was almost over and immediately after they finally brought the food we requested to-go boxes and the manager to complain. We complained to the manager about the very slow speed of service and he acted as if it was normal and was very insincere. He even encouraged us to use their website to order in advance. It took another 10 minutes to box up the food by the waiter and the manager brought the bill with a 50% discount. But he repeated that we should use their website to order in advance next time. Next time? There will not be a next time! With so many other choices in that area BJ's will be the last place I choose for lunch. Once we got back to work and ate our food it did not taste good. It was very bland and boring as if it was sitting for a while. I wonder why? After all that waiting for so long I was hoping at the very least that the food would be really good but it wasn't. Very disappointing!Besides the manager  the wait staff were very friendly and nice however they have no clue what speed of service means. If you are debating whether or not go here for lunch I would highly recommend that you go somewhere else unless you have plenty of time to waste and like the taste of bland boring food.
Abigail L.,Sacramento  CA,556,632,1553,6/23/2013,4.0,I went here for dessert and I got the red velvet pizookie. I love red velvet so I figured I would like this too. Unfortunately I wasnt able to eat all of it since it was just so sweet. I also tried the raspberry chocolate pizookie which was probably my favorite one there. I didnt really care for the oreo pizookie so I wouldnt get that again. The service was okay but it seemed like I waited a while for my desserts.
Amber M.,Boise  ID,234,138,95,6/4/2014,4.0,Love this place! There are so many options on the menu  and it's the perfect place for large parties! It is super busy  so if you're looking for a more quiet  low key place  this BJ's wouldn't be it. I have never had a problem with the service here  and everyone seems to be so friendly. Always coming back for more.
Sophia S.,Carmichael  CA,0,8,3,8/27/2015,1.0,I will NEVER eat here again!!!! I have been here many times before and tonight was RIDICULOUS AND UNCALLED FOR!!! I Ordered My Burger Well Done And Got A Bloody Burger! Talk about appetite killer! When they brought me my second burger it was STILL pink! I am VERY upset! For a $102 bill I DID NOT GET MY MONEYS WORTH!!! HORRIBLE FOOD!! WILL NEVER EBER GO BACK HERE!!!!
Ashley S.,Walnut Creek  CA,222,39,27,7/18/2015,3.0,This BJs is at a great location (the mall) and had a great beer selection. However  the avocado rolls and calamari were not as good as they typically are at other BJ locations. Great service. Somewhat overpriced.
Cynthia Z.,Sacramento  CA,34,25,8,10/30/2015,2.0,I have been to bjs many times and this was by far the worst service at bjs and my history of dining anywhere. First our group was told 45 min wait  took hour 5 mins and multiple times asking what the delay was. Once sat the waitress was very sweet and the appetizers were good but from there service went down drain. It's took 45 mins to get food and than it was cold or hard from sitting under lights. My toddlers plate was so hot from sitting they had to hold it with two pot holders she ordered chicken tenders but the plate was burning hot. Than my fianc  mother in law  sister in law and sister in laws dad all had to send there burgers back due to it sitting so long  or for being hard.. Manager did his best but the overall experience was awful
Jackie G.,Elk Grove  CA,0,12,3,12/4/2015,5.0,I had an awesome experience at the Arden location. My waitress was amazing!!!  My waitress was so great I left her a 30% tip!! Food was great too!!
Catherine J.,Sonora  CA,131,89,74,9/17/2015,4.0,The folks here were very accommodating for our little party. The food was good  the customer service was good  and they let us hang out to visit for a couple hours without being pushy. It can get a bit loud when the place is packed  otherwise  it's a good restaurant that's connected to a shopping mall.
Linnea S.,Emeryville  CA,37,19,11,9/17/2015,5.0,"This was my first time here at BJs restaurant. Man  can I say it was very tasty. A friend brought me here I had the ""Top Sirloin Steak""  with asparagus with broccoli and cheese soup."
Matthew B.,Chico  CA,35,331,70,6/24/2015,2.0,Frankly I was not impressed with the food. It was average and corporate. The service was prompt and efficient. The staff nice.
Jennifer S.,South Lake Tahoe  CA,89,115,461,4/18/2014,1.0,Ugh with so many good restaurants in Sacramento  I had to stop in this one. Although the staff was friendly  they took forever the duration of the meal. The food was good if you like Applebee's and TGIF's (which is by the way microwaved). No flavor on the California club or the fried chicken. I was very disappointed and it wasn't worth my time or money.
Josh O.,Chicago  IL,61,5,,1/17/2015,5.0,Yummy! The Thai lettuce wraps are yummy!Oh and the service is good and the bathrooms are super nice!
Alliver V.,San Francisco  CA,586,243,104,4/22/2013,3.0,The food is delicious and I recently tried the irish root beer. It is my new drink! The Pazookies are also my favorite.The service is okay. It's not the greatest but it can get busy and hectic while in dining at BJs. Sometimes you can get forgotten by your servers. I'd come back again.
Jonathan F.,West Sacramento  CA,266,96,64,10/4/2015,4.0,I love their pizza  though wish I could do it more often though definitely not the most healthy. This would be a cheat day without question. Amazing food  lots of beer on tap especially their IPAs.
Shaina Marie W.,Sacramento  CA,68,94,64,10/4/2015,1.0,Tried to make reservations for 20 people and they couldn't fit us in on a Sunday night. I'm at the Natomas location 1-2 times a week personally and have never been denied for any size group. At the Natomas location we walked in on mothers day with 26 people and got seated immediately. Disappointed with this Arden location.
Teresa S.,Sacramento  CA,245,95,150,7/31/2014,3.0,First  let me start by saying 3-Stars means I STILL LIKE IT!! BJs is a classic go to when I just don't know what I want  and am not in the mood to experiment with something new. It's also the place I go when my friends and I just can't decide/agree.Less expensive than the near by Cheesecake Factory and WAY More Beer on Tap! Also they have Berry Burst Cider and a pretty good Happy Hour! We always sit at the bar and get good service from the Bartender  and additionally the people that come to BJs and sit at the bar are equally friendly and social. The foods ALWAYS great. Exactly what I ordered with no surprises  and delicious.I only took away stars because 1) it's a chain... i.e. nothing special and 2) there's almost always a wait  and the bars always crowded.
Jennifer T.,Sacramento  CA,7,107,43,8/27/2015,4.0,Superb customer service. The only downside was that the waitress forgot one of our items we requested. But she quickly got it to us after I reminded her. Food was good. I happened to like the BJ's in Natomas better than this one.
Ninarae N.,Elk Grove  CA,443,183,198,2/18/2014,1.0,The BJ's attached to Arden Mall is the absolute worst Bjs I've ever been to. I've only been here once and I will never return. My sister in law and I came here after a wedding rehearsal starving. We were seated in the bar area which wasn't even busy at all. I remember seeing at least 2 servers manning this area. The guy took our drink orders and then never returned to take our food order. He walked passed us multiple times  clearly noticing we still had menus on the table. Over half an hour had passed and we still hadn't been helped. I left $5 on the table to cover the expense of our drinks (I'm not one to dine and dash  no matter how bad the service is) and left. As I was leaving  I politely notified the host that we hadn't been served and that I was pretty upset. She apologized & I told her it wasn't her fault  but maybe to bring it up to a manager so that situations such as these don't come up again. Though I was pretty livid  I'm not so sure another customer would have been as polite as I. From now on  I'll just make the extra trip to Elk Grove or natomas if I want my bjs fix. Btw  I'm only leaving one star because I have to.
J.K. E.,Sacramento  CA,0,21,,10/24/2014,5.0,BJ's Restaurants are a regional craft brewery in Northern California. They have locations in Roseville  Natomas and at Arden Mall. I have eaten at three of them. The one in Roseville is where they brew their ales. The service at Arden was great and the ales are superb. The food is good and they are busy enough  so you know they doing something right. I had a good time at their Happy Hour and would recommend them to any of my beer-drinking friends.
Jairo B.,Sacramento  CA,4,19,25,5/1/2016,3.0,I would give them 5 stars only because after they neglected to give us a table outside that was available  only for laziness to clean it  we discovered the place next door (Seasons52) what a pleasant experience we had next door  thank you BJ's :)
Paola M.,Sacramento  CA,9,30,16,7/31/2014,4.0,I was actually very indecisive about coming here on my birthday dinner  but it was already pretty late ( almost 11 pm) and we were already in the area. I wasn't too hungry since we had already ate a couple hours earlier. So I decided to order the calamari appetizer. The calamari was really good. It came with marinara sauce  ranch  and slices of lemon. The waitress was very sweet. I got a free chocolate chip pizookie. It was delicious. I'd soo come here just for that. It was pretty packed in their  being that it was the last day of the state fair  but our appetizers came fairly fast. Though we didnt get free refills on our drinks it didnt matter to much. Anywho I would come here again for sure  I don't know why this place has quite bad reviews. I liked it here :)
Sambo C.,Sacramento  CA,251,111,123,9/7/2012,3.0,I've been to BJ's several times and most of the time  it's just mediocre. There's nothing really that great about it. Their beer is what they're known for but I wouldn't say that it is spectacular or anything. I've ordered dishes such as pasta  pizza  stuffed potatoes  salads and more but there is really nothing that would keep me coming back for more. Service varies depending on your waiter. Some are really attentive and they give you their input on certain beers that they like. They also have a nice dimmed interior which I appreciate about the place.I guess this is a good place to go if you're just planning to stay out late and drink since they close at 1 or 2. Other than that there's nothing else to look forward to here.
Kelsey M.,Sacramento  CA,57,4,1,11/21/2015,4.0,Yesterday was my birthday and my first time eating here. When we got here we had to wait 30 mins to be seated it was really crowded. When we finally got seated we ordered and we were served in 15-20 mins like whoa that was pretty quick! My plate was delicious the deep dit ziti i think it was called it was with penne pasta topped with mozarella cheese and marinara sauce and meatballs. What i really liked was that i was surprised with a pumpkin pizookie with a lighting candle for my birthday! My aunt told one of the waitresses that she wanted to surprise me for my birthday amd they suggested that and another cool thing was they didnt even charge her for that! We tipped them and left happy!
Janet S.,San Dimas  CA,7,6,,5/30/2016,5.0,Visited this location This weekend and the service was top notch! Our server was professional and courteous and never left us hanging on a busy day. Very clean environment as well. Would definitely go back for the delish food and awesome service!!!!
Shauna S.,Vacaville  CA,48,10,8,8/23/2015,4.0,Had a fantastic server  awesome food AND my meal was made to order with no errors! Made for a great date night and our server even helped walk me through how to save 20% by paying from the app!
Jeremy O.,Sacramento  CA,90,24,1,8/19/2015,5.0,The peanut butter pizookies are so good that they should be illegal! All kidding aside  BJ's is a great spot for a beer and some good food. Never disappoints.
Chris R.,Sacramento  CA,0,33,1,11/13/2015,2.0,Hi I have been going to BJ'S for a long while. Never had any issues. I decided to make a trip at the Arden mall location for a business lunch. As many restaurants have specialty drinks usually with liqueur. Well since this is work I really did not want so I ordered a virgin style version. The waitress could but would charge me the same amount as it would be for a drink with liqueur. I have gone to many bjs and it seems with this particular location it's all about the money. Don't know if it's a mall mentality or what. I have ordered this drink along with many others virgin style and they automatically deducted a dollar to 50 cents due to the alcohol difference. I will continue to go to my other favorite locations of bjs  Stockton  concord  Vacaville  and Roseville. Never again here at arden mall.
Sarah F.,Sacramento  CA,26,11,,9/29/2015,5.0,Great service! Our server was Karah and she was the best! Excellent customer service! Always coming to check on us  keeping our drinks full  and very knowledgable about the new menu items and beers! I had the black and bleu burger  my friend had a mini pizza  and we shared the queso dip! Everything was perfect and we will definitely be back again! 5 stars for Karah!
Rod V.,Dixon  CA,0,94,,4/20/2016,5.0,We loved this restaurant - great staff and good food.  We had stuffed mushrooms  potato skins  Santa Fe salad  Heniken and their house Porter.  It's in the Arden Mall.
Sam B.,San Antonio  TX,82,254,21,4/14/2012,2.0,Every time I come here with friends  they talk about how good the pizza is. And every time they do  I just feel bad for them. It must be pretty sad to live in a place with so many wonderful pizza options and think that this is as good as it gets.The food here is okay at best. The pizza is a Chicago-style deal with the very thick crust and the diced tomatoes  but it really just doesn't taste that great. I've had some of the other things  and the experience is about the same. The pasta is okay. The lunch stuff (like the tacos) are okay. But for what you're paying  I'd expect something better.Not being a drinker  I can't really speak to the beers here  but I understand that the variety is vast. That's a plus  if you're coming for that sort of thing. I  however  come to restaurants for the food. And here  it's all Randy Jackson: it's just alright for me  dawg.
Beth R.,Galt  CA,77,6,,11/2/2015,4.0,I love the service here. I have gone several times with my sister and never had bad service. The atmosphere is comfortable and not cold (which I have experienced at other restaurants). We sat at the bar  and the bartender made sure my non-alcoholic drink was always filled. The pumpkin beer is one of our favorites  which is so very good. I ordered the Asian salad with modifications  and it came out perfect and tasty. I had my mouth watering for the Thai Mango Salad that I had last week  but they had a menu change and no longer serve it. Please bring that one back. Overall  BJ;s is by far my go to restaurant as the menu has about everything you want.
Sammy C.,San Jose  CA,242,420,746,1/4/2012,3.0,This BJ is inside the Arden Fair shopping mall; very nice and convenience location.They seem to be very busy every time we go visit  usually chill at the bar area. However  their waters/waitresses weren't too efficient; we usually have to wait for like a good 6min when we found a table before someone comes over to take orders.Their food and drink are just ok  I think we like the environment more than everything there  especially if you are a sport game fan - they have many TVs with the games on; I took two stars off because it has been always difficult to get their attention to order more stuff.
Brittany P.,Walnut Creek  CA,466,123,42,12/17/2014,1.0,"It makes me sad that I am giving Bj\'s a one star review.I used to be an avid Bj\'s lover -HA- but now don\'t even think about going there due to so many reasons. Service: Uhh yeah  why does everyone seem so miserable when I go? Am I the bad aurora? Well anyways  one time I went with a classmate to squeeze in dinner in between classes and didn\'t know what we wanted. We glanced at the menu and our waiter said.... I kid you not  -annoyed voice- ""Will you hurry up and order?"" I responded  what? ""Yeah  you\'re taking up my time."" What?! I was so shocked that I decided to live tweet what she was saying to the other people there for dinner. It wasn\'t nice at all. HahaAnother time I went  they took FOREVERRRRRR. Like FOREVER. My roommate and I went and it took the 30 minutes to greet us at the table  bring waters and then add 10 minutes of finally getting our order in... Oh and there was like 2 families in the entire restaurant. Take goodness for the pay-early-app. Recently  I did an office take out order and when I went to go pick it up  practically everyone was in a bad mood. I went up to the hostess to ask if she can call someone to the togo counter and she was like  ""Just wait over there and be patient."" OKAY. Sorry. I said PLEASE and I am told I\'m a nice person. A few other times I went they weren\'t so bad  but I had dealt with a few attitudes when I asked them to scan my reward card and such. Food: It\'s good  but only if you order your usual. Haha and the pizookies are the only reason why I\'ll ever come back. Womp womp. I will definitely be back to BJs  just not the Arden one."
Steven H.,Sacramento  CA,68,11,,10/28/2015,5.0,Good food and atmosphere. The ice cream cookie sandwiches are the bomb! Their spicy pig pizza is one of my favorite all time pizza anywhere. I give BJs 5 stars
David A.,Davis  CA,0,1,,6/3/2016,5.0,Came in for a quick dinner with my girlfriend. The food was good  but our server Sabrina was amazing. She was quick to help with anything we asked for and was super positive. Thanks for the great service Sabrina!
Kilifi F.,Sacramento  CA,23,19,3,7/16/2014,2.0,"Not the best eating experience compared to our neighboring BJ\'s""I\'d rather have Hooters"" -DJ  accompanying friend"
Melisa M.,Las Vegas  NV,129,40,50,7/31/2014,4.0,Very pleased with the food and service here. We came in with a group of 8 on a Saturday afternoon with no reservation. We were sat in about 15 minutes even though they were very busy. Our server was great. I wish I could remember her name. She even put up with us all needing separate checks with a smile on her face.I had the turkey burger with no bun and I was pleasantly surprised. Usually when I get this at a restaurant it is dry and flavorless  but it was done very well here. My gf got the Thai chicken mango salad and she said it was very good as well.
Jay O.,Woodland  CA,0,7,3,5/10/2015,2.0,My son took me to bjs restaurant for mothers day today we ordered the mac and cheese for my grandson when it came to the table it was crunchy and dry we had the watress take it back to the kitchen to make another mac and cheese when she brought it back it still looked the same way my salmon was very dry with no sauce the deep dish pizza was really bad i could of went to papa murphy and got a better pizza I do not recommend the restaurant
Barbara R.,Citrus Heights  CA,17,12,,5/16/2016,5.0,We had a wonderful time and fantastic server. Great environment  great food  and super good service!! Can't ask for anything more!! Five STARS!! *****
Erin H.,Snohomish  WA,29,156,70,6/25/2015,5.0,I love this place ! I always get the best service ( Juan Carlos your fabulous ). I love the Ahi Poke appetizer and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos ( on the healthy side). Their pizzas our great   deep dish style. I love their beers as well.
Matthew M.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,4/26/2015,1.0,This place was horrible the server named Joan  was to busy to ever come to our table for refills... We had to keep flagging down passing workers. Ordered a large pizza came out raw and doughy  and the small pizza was extremely small and over priced  typical shitty food chain restaurant!!!
Shelly F.,Marathon  FL,35,12,6,8/27/2015,4.0,Kudos to our server Oriol  outstanding service. He anticipated our needs and did an awesome
Mim D.,Sacramento  CA,317,113,75,3/4/2014,3.0,Been here a couple of times already and each time I leave a bit dissatisfied. I've had the rib eye  pork chop  salad  BBQ ribs  chicken Alfredo  pizza. None of which gave me a wow factor. The food is mediocre but it's a nice chill setting. They do offer great beer and wine selection. I do like their Asian chicken salad and the spinach dip appetizer. I don't know if I'll be coming back when I keep leaving not satisfied.
Marissa M.,Manteca  CA,1,25,1,7/29/2015,5.0,Just had lunch here earlier  and the servicr was quick and food was great. Our server Colleen was so great. Would def be back!
Duane H.,Rancho Cordova  CA,114,621,29,11/23/2011,2.0,Could you get any more plebeian...?Not my cup of tea...and bad service to boot...
Angela H.,Richmond  CA,52,725,180,1/19/2012,4.0,Yummmmm! The appetizer sampler was bomb! Those avocado spring rolls were SO amazingly good. I didn't think I was going to like them at all. Stuffed mushrooms were okay. The pesto sauce on them was good. Good spinach dip  too.But $10 for a margarita?? Holy eff. I was thinking maybe $7. Sheesh. I won't be ordering a drink the next time I go.
Julian F.,San Ramon  CA,75,7,,3/1/2015,3.0,So I went there this afternoon for my sisters birthday. We were at the mall shopping and I had called the front desk and asked what the wait was and they said there was no wait and that we would be seated right away. We got there and had to wait 25 minutes. Unfortunate  but things happen.Our waiter brought our drinks quickly and took our food order quick as well. We went through two full rounds of drinks 30 minutes or so before the food came. And good thing one of the food runners came up to us and asked about our order and we noticed that it was incorrect.When we finally got our food all of our burgers were cooked the same  and when I say cooked  I mean left on the grill to get all dry and charred. Why ask me how I want my burger then to just cook all the burgers very well done? And the toppings I had on my burger we scarce and depressed looking. Don't get the jalapeo burger. It sounds like a good idea. But those jalapeos were the size of almonds. And there was like 5 of them... With no chipotle sauce.Lastly we waited for 10 minutes for a pizza togo box.Positives: cold drinks  nice atmosphere  not too loud(as some bjs are)Negatives: the food was poorly done  the servers seemed to not work well together (very disorganized)
Nancy K.,Brea  CA,0,51,38,3/24/2016,5.0,So happy BJs accommodated our huge group with short notice. We estimated 30 people but the storm of our state win brought 60 of us here to celebrate. The wait staff handled our huge group wonderfully and efficiently with quick service to hungry people..thank u so much BJ's  you're the best!!
Andrew K.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,1,1/24/2015,1.0,Did reserve for 6 people in 2 hours advance and they did not have my name on the list. They said we have to wait for 2 hours. Forget it!
Wendy N.,Berkeley  CA,343,296,75,7/19/2012,4.0,If you are like me  and a few hours of hardcore shopping make you feel like you just did a stage of the Tour de France  this place was like a pond in the middle of the desert! I was on a mission to get a new outfit and determined not to leave the mall without something cute to wear on my next night out. I succeeded but it took three hours  tough decisions  endless trips to the dressing rooms  and a big dent in my credit card. What does one do after this? Get a BIG beer! Having an ACTUAL BAR located in a shopping mall is a genious idea. It has a darkish interior  lots of TVs  and a good selection of drafts. I briefly perused the menu (which seemed to have standard pub food) but just ordered a thirst quenching  soul saving Racer IPA  a wonderfully strong yet easily drinkable IPA.Felt very revived after this and happily left the mall feeling uplifted  satiated and ready to conquer the world. (Just kidding  but I WAS in a better mood and not so tired) :)
Stephanie T.,Corning  CA,0,19,,2/19/2015,3.0,Good food and over nice atmosphere. It does get very loud in the evening and if you do not have a reservation  then you might have to wait a while. The chili is the best thing on the menu. I also love the grilled pork chops. They make a few flavors of soda which are really good. Good for a date or family dinner.
John L.,Sacramento  CA,210,11,2,1/29/2015,4.0,Their unlimited soup and salad lunch special for less than $8 is unbeatable. It's super good and healthy. I have been here 3 times in the past 10 days!
David M.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,3/9/2015,1.0,I went here with my family for lunch today. We were seated and given our menu. We sat there for 25 minutes and nobody came to ask for our drink. We disn't even have water. Mind you the waitress who walked past us 4 times who was serving a table across from us. I told my kids who were wondering why we were not being helped that we can go somewhere. I then called the restaurant to speak with a manager and he did not even apologize and told me well you can come back and we will help you. Was very upset with the customer service.
Don P.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,6/22/2016,5.0,I tried to use the App to get on the preferred wait list and several times it just froze and was unable to make the reservation without calling. A little frustrating but all worked out. We got seated in a reasonable time and while waiting we were served Root Beer and Tomato & Cheese Pizza. We ordered a variety of food and all items were excellent and no one got sick as other people have indicated. I am not quite sure how they narrowed it down as their normal food could have been bad. We brought our own wine which they cork (1st bottle only) for free. My son and I had Jeremiah Red beer and thoroughly enjoyed it. An excellent compliment to our dinner. The waitress was extraordinary and very attentive and the Manager followed up with a courtesy visit to see how things were. If you are looking for a quiet and romantic place to be then this is not the place for you. Something is always going on and the place is filled with excitement. We will definitely be visiting here every chance we get.
Lee S.,Sacramento  CA,32,32,,10/12/2013,2.0,Another BJ's  another bad customer experience. You have to give this chain credit  they're consistent. If it weren't the Christmas shooing season  I'd have no business at the mall an no business at this lackluster version of a brew pub. Silver lining: Racer 5 IPA on tap.Let BJ's be your emergency only food and beverage experience.
Airen P.,Sacramento  CA,13,17,,12/14/2015,1.0,"My office is near here so we go to BJ\'s for take out on a semi-regular basis. They mess up my order about 90% of the time. EVERY time we\'ve ever done a curbside order  they tell us to come in and get it because they\'re too busy to bring it out (what\'s the point  of curbside v takeout  then??). The icing on the cake today that prompted me to actually post a review was the complete lack of customer service when I called to tell them they\'d forgotten half my order. I do appreciate that they refunded me the full amount rather than half (I got a soup/salad combo and only received the salad... a $3.75 quarter of a head of lettuce with some onion and tomato on top... supposed to be a ""wedge salad""). My appreciation stops there. It took 10 min. worth of passing the phone before someone could even help me with a refund  and then they ""accidentally"" hung up on me... when I called back I didn\'t even get an apology for the phone disconnection. When the manager did refund my money for the order  he acted like he\'d just GIFTED me a gourmet four course meal. With SO many other options at Arden Mall  I\'d recommend avoiding this location of BJ\'s unless you are looking to be disappointed in your meal/ experience."
Khatirah R.,Yuba City  CA,19,6,,7/1/2015,5.0,Love this place !! I've been here a couple of times and I have to admit they always offer delicious food and have great customer service. Anyone looking for a good place to have lunch or dinner  I definitely recommend you guys to try BJ's  you will love it!
Nicole B.,Elk Grove  CA,266,208,624,8/31/2013,3.0,My girlfriend and I along with her 7 year old stopped in to refuel after some heavy duty mall shopping. It was only about 445pm and surprisedly they had a 10 minute wait that actually turned out to be a 15 minute wait. We asked to eat on the patio but were told no patio service. Too bad cause it was a wonderful hot August evening. We were finally seated and ordered. Our drinks were promptly brought but we had to wait another 25 minutes for our meals. WTH?? People that were sat after us were getting their food. Waiter did not check in or give us an update. I finally complained and he immediately brought us our two entrees   ( at this point we all know they were tanning under the heat lamp). Well I was famished at this point and getting cranky. Luckily the entree I ordered was DELIC O U S  !!! I ordered the Hawaiian style pork chop and subbed out the red potatoes for the pineapple fried rice. OMG this rice was so good. Both items were on the under 550 calories menu  not sure how but I was so hungry at this point I didn't care about calorie counting and inhaled every last grain! Lots of pineapple  peppers  very flavorful and not greasy at all. Chop was good sauce was sweet and tasty  green beans were not that great. Again i loved the rice. While the service was typical chain type   the entree was so tasty and reasonably priced I will have me go back again and soon as it was only $14 and some change after tax.
Steve M.,Carmichael  CA,30,61,1,1/12/2015,3.0,I really really want to like BJs  and I used to like it s lot. Service is fine  food is good  big beer selection. However  it's become way overpriced for what it is  and their last menu tweak took out most of the things I like. If you don't mind spending $40 for dinner at a chain restaurant...go for it.
Bob B.,Dana Point  CA,18,8,48,7/30/2013,3.0,After taking my parents to the mall to fix their computer at the Apple Store they wanted to stop and have a meal at BJ's. The hostess was friendly and professional. The server was pleasant enough but her service did not impress me. Dad had a burger which he enjoyed and mom seemed to really like her Southern Fried Chicken. My meal consisted of uninspired tacos. Nothing really special about this place but acceptable if you are shopping at the Arden Fair Mall.
Stefanie H.,Sacramento  CA,111,230,,8/27/2013,2.0,Whenever I review a chain restaurant or fast food place  I try to review it in light of my expectations for that kind of place. I want to make that clear because I'm not saying BJ's deserves 2 stars because they're not Chez Panisse. They deserve 2 stars because  even as a middle of the road casual chain restaurant  they fail.My dining partner and I had the spaghetti with marinara and the veggie burger with seasoned fries. Only the fries were of acceptable quality. The spaghetti was overcooked and mushy  and we're pretty sure they covered it in the spicy sauce even though my dining partner ordered the regular sauce. This was one of the view vegetarian-friendly items on the menu  and it was unacceptably bad. I had high school boyfriends who made better spaghetti. For nearly $10  the waiter brought out a plate of watery  mushy noodles with sauce that wasn't even particularly good.The veggie burger was only marginally better  but it was by far the worst veggie burger I've ever had at a restaurant. The bun was toasted to the point that it was crunchy and dry  and the burger was tiny in relation to the massive bun. The burger was pretty bland  and the menu didn't say what exactly was in it. The fries were good  but the waiter didn't bother to bring ketchup out with the food  so both the burger and fries were fairly cold before I actually started eating. I definitely won't be back to a BJ's  both because of the poor selection of vegetarian/vegan options and the overall lack of quality in what they did offer.
Tara M.,Carmichael  CA,22,38,8,6/8/2013,1.0,"People! Pay attention to all the reviews saying the service is rotten! Even with these bad reviews constantly coming in BJ\'s still can\'t get it right.Our group decided to go there for a special occasion and we called in a reservation which they supposedly said they could do. When the group got there at the time they reserved they still had to wait an hour. After ordering they waited an hour for their food. I was 2 hours late and my group was just being served the food when I got there and there were still people WAITING for their food!Note for those who have never been to any BJ\'s: it is a full bar restaurant with TVs playing in most corners of the building so the volumes can get pretty loud.The ""manager"" Al came to our table and told our guest of honor to shut up because our table was supposedly getting too loud  this was understandably upsetting to our guest of honor specifically because most of the people at the table were still pretty cranky from being hungry.When two of the orders arrived at the table with tomatoes after they had been specifically asked to be tomato free our table did become progressively loud with anger. We explained that we would not be paying for food that had been brought out after an hour and prepared incorrectly and Al informed us that we would still have to pay or he would call security. He did call security  and the police. We only paid for the incorrectly made pizza because one slice had been eaten (it didn\'t have tomatoes on the slice).If Al really is the manager  he is by far the worst manager I have ever dealt with. He knows nothing of customer service and belongs nowhere near the food industry. His waiters know what they are doing more than he does; for instance the waitress that served my friend his dessert an hour after he ordered it and after he had to ask twice and was told it was made wrong one of the times  he ended up getting his dessert for free. The BJ\'s at Arden is a joke."
Julianna K.,Sacramento  CA,0,10,1,12/29/2015,1.0,I got served RAW chicken and when I asked for a mini pizza instead they charged me for my meal. RAW CHICKEN. The only thin that was done is they apologized for the RAW chicken. Then they messed up my bill three times and kept trying to over charge me. They are lucky that I didn't get sick.
Samantha L.,Sacramento  CA,288,553,1160,8/24/2011,2.0,"I\'ve been to several other BJ\'s locations before  and this one  compared to all of my other experiences  really doesn\'t compare. (And that\'s not a good thing.) I came here on a Saturday night with two other people and we headed over to the bar  which was about 1/2 full. We sat down at a tall table near the bar because all of the open booths were dirty. There were five un-bussed tables; when the server came to ask us for our orders  we kindly asked if we could sit at a booth and we had 3 people tell us yes  but still no one bussed the tables. Finally  the fourth person helped us. We then ordered drinks and they came out pretty quickly.My boyfriend got a beer  which was pretty good  as usual ($4.95/pint). If you\'ve never been to BJ\'s or just want a variety  there beer sampler is pretty fun; you get several 5 ounce glasses of their different beers.I ordered the berry burst cider ($5.95/pint). It tasted just like a Capri Sun  or juicy juice box. I wouldn\'t get this again.My friend ordered the Cherry Cola drink ($6.95/glass). It wasn\'t very good. She loves cherry flavor and didn\'t even like it that much.Overall  I\'d only order beer if I were to ever come back for drinks. Less than half-way through our drinks  someone came to our table and asked us if we wanted to order any other drinks. Since we had barely made a dent in our current drinks (and they weren\'t closing for over an hour)  we were going to take our time  so we said that we didn\'t want to order anything yet. The girl then left our bill there. We finished our drinks  paid  and left. I don\'t know why she rushed us out of there  or if she meant to  but I don\'t think I""ll be coming back for drinks soon. Notes:-Plenty of parking because it\'s at the mall. -If it\'s your birthday you get a free small pizookie."
Ngoc L.,San Jose  CA,345,394,5388,5/23/2011,3.0,I came here for dinner today after a failed attempt at the mall. The whole purpose to go Arden was for me to get a pair of shoes from Aldo but they didn't have it. We notices BJ's just recently opened on our way out so decided to give it a shot. Orange creme soda: This was one of their handcrafted soda. It was pretty good.. A lil too sweet for my liking but my little brother enjoyed it. Ahi poki: This was for appetizers. They had some really chips to go along with the tuna sashimi mixed with avocados and lettuce. A bit on the salty side..But the chips was the best!BJ Pizza: The pizza was decent... Sausage was good. I would've liked the pizza more if it was a little crunchier and less soft. It tasted a bit too doughy for me. Scampi Pasta: I would not recommend this plate. The pasta was very bland.. The best part of the dish was the shrimp which was well done...flavorful. Overall  I would give it a 3.5  the food was just decent.. The appetizers was my favorite part of the meal. I didn't have room for dessert but I'll get to it next time I come back.
Brent R.,Bakersfield  CA,4,13,1,9/15/2013,2.0,"When I was exploring places for lunch on Yelp  at first I disregarded this BJ\'s restaurant because of the three star average review they had received. But because I have been to other BJ\'s before  and never had an issue  I decided to try it anyways. To keep this short  I am just going to highlight the issues I had. Most of the food was what I would expect from BJ\'s  and for the most part the waitress was average to slightly above average (quick drinks  checking in with us enough  but not too much). The really problem was with an omelette that one person at our table ordered off the brunch menu. This omelette looked like something that was frozen  microwaved  then set under a heat lamp for a couple of hours. It was complemented with some fast food like fried potato squares and plopped on a plate with no presentation. The patron took two bites out of the omelette and pushed the plate to the side  in obvious distaste. Then he grazed off the rest of our plates for the rest of the meal.The real shocker in this story was that the waitress noticed the full plate pushed to the side  but never once asked if there was a problem or how the food was. She asked if we wanted a box  I said no need. Then the owner of the omelet said ""Actually I think the dogs would eat this.""And that was it  we paid and left  never to return again."
Destiny S.,Sacramento  CA,11,18,6,2/14/2015,5.0,My bf and I came here for Valentines day today(2015) and we ordered the crispy calamari  chile verde fries  fritos nachos  crispy jalapeo burger and double deluxe. The food was great. Love the service  such friendly people. The atmosphere was lively and my bf and I never been there before so it was something new to us. We will be back soon to try more of their delicious food.
Heidi H.,Carmichael  CA,978,681,976,4/30/2011,4.0,OMG I am sooo glad we got our own here in Sacramento. I love the food and the atmosphere. Broccoli cheese soup  to die for! So rich and creamy. I like to go and watch a game and since there are TV's everywhere I don't have to ask for a special place to sit. I can see one from everywhere and my husband cant complain. I haven't been able to check out there happy hour as of yet  but believe me I will.  I had the opportunity to go there before they opened via a special invitation to local businesses. They were training the employees and had all free food. The restaurant was FULL and the staff was friendly and very attentive. I only worry about the parking situation because I know how the other BJ's get. When i went it was a weekday and the mall wasn't too busy so we were able to park right out front. I guess time will tell on that.
Leah D.,Escondido  CA,32,69,76,11/7/2013,4.0,"BJ\'s has this mini bite plate salad that is so good. It\'s watermelon with feta and only $2.95! Everytime I\'ve come I have ordered it. It never disappoints. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms and they were so good. We came in around 10 pm. As we got seated we asked our waitress ""Is it happy hour?"" And she was not able to answer our simple question. She said she didn\'t work Wednesday nights. Well sorry but your job is to know. We also got seated way in the back. No other parties were seated next to us. But it worked out so we could be loud. The service was slow and it was NOT busy at all. Even getting our waters took a long time. Other friends ordered a small pizza  burgers  and mozzarella sticks. They all enjoyed their food. The 4 stars are just based on the food. I am sad to say that the watermelon salad will be removed from the menu according to our waitress."
Megan S.,Concord  CA,18,15,1,3/31/2013,1.0,AWFUL!My server Robert I think his name was was just RUDE!i work in the service industry too and i know when its slamed its hard. HOWEVER  that does NOT mean you get to be an asshole to everyone who gets put in your section. I am a vegan  it sucks to go out to eat sometimes and i know i should go to more vegan friendly places but my roommate had her heart set on bjs. I asked what was in the batter for the deep fry and Robert just rolled his eyes at me. WHAT? (ps  it has eggs)I get asked crazy ass questions all time  deal with it.So i had my food my total came to 3.51my friends came to 18.??he gave us both our checks in one book  she put her card in the pocket with her total i set mine on the side with my total.He came back and the wrong cards had been chargedTHIS IS WHERE IT GETS INSANE.fyi  if you dont know how to reverse charges GET A MANAGER!he said it was our fault and then went to switch it  and came back with both bills on my card  charged AGAIN!i told him now they were both on my card he grunted and rolled his eyes again. came back with correct bills and said a manager would be back soon. this was well over an hour after the first bill was brought. the manager came and said sorry and my card would be back to normal in a few days. nothing more. just sorry. i will NEVER go back again.Also  Robert if you see this  dont work with people anymore. ALSO. its been 3 days  ive still paid for three meals.....
Jessica M.,Sacramento  CA,7,25,4,7/23/2015,5.0,Excellent customer service during my lunch visit. Great food loved the drinks overall good times
Robert D.,East Sacramento  Sacramento  CA,1,43,11,6/20/2015,3.0,"It\'s in the ""mall"" which makes it the go to place when shopping. I wouldn\'t make a special trip to eat here. Food is good but not special. The beer selection is good and goes good with the burger"
Chrissy G.,Sacramento  CA,3,20,4,10/17/2014,1.0,Food was mediocre  they have changed the menu so the item on there was no longer on there. Just have had better food. Service was decent no complaints. When I walked in after my party was sat I asked the hostess where they were and was told to walk around and find them . Probably won't return
Douglas Y.,Sacramento  CA,566,888,2236,4/9/2013,3.0,Newer BJ's located in Arden Fair Mall  this location is actually quieter than the normal BJ's. Typical sports bar type set up with multiple flat screens set up throughout the establishment. I have a theory about BJ's. The food service at every BJ's I have been to has always been slow  no matter what you order or how busy it is. I think it is BJ's policy to make you wait for your food in hopes of increasing appetizer and more importantly your DRINK orders while you wait. That being said the menu is pretty vast and the food selections are competent but nothing special.
Kimberly D.,Roseville  CA,25,119,49,3/15/2012,4.0,Went on a Tuesday night at 10pm and was surprised to see so many people there. We were a table of 4.Sat at a booth at the bar waited a little long for menu's (but what do you expect when you seat yourself?) plus their was a bit of a server change right in the beginning. We ordered a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red. Not my style at all but a good deep bitter beer for those who are looking. Ordered the Avocado spring rolls and mozzarella sticks to start it all off.Looking at the menu after 10 mini pizzas are half-off and appetizers were also discounted. I think it was $3 off. Avocado rolls were awesome  and mozzarella sticks were great.What came next was ordering 3 mini pizzas. We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke  Buffalo Chicken and then the NEW! Gourmet Five Meat pizza. I didn't get to sample the Buffalo Chicken. But from the looks and the fact I didn't get any it must have been good. I am now also in love with the Spinach & Artichoke pizza it was very saucy just the way pizza should be. The new Five Meat was fantastic as well it could not have been cooked better.
Vanessa M.,Fair Oaks  CA,1,15,6,5/8/2015,4.0,Delicious chicken nachos  good happy hour  good lunch menu  typical restaurant chain.
Lien V.,Elk Grove  CA,172,133,355,10/15/2013,4.0,Strawberry Mojitos!!! Need I say more? During Happy Hour  you can enjoy yourself a Strawberry Mojitos for $5.00. These bad boys are addicting! Add on a flatbread pizza and Im good to go. Its always nice to just chill  drink  eat and enjoy a good football game on a Sunday afternoon. This Bj's is conveniently located inside Arden Mall. Clever location to be since I kinda got tired of shopping so we decided to have a drink and snack before our next destination. Service here was ok  could be better! Service in EG is a lot better though I must say.
Ken H.,Sacramento  CA,3,21,7,2/28/2015,3.0,Somewhat disappointed. ...tried their Lasagne  it was very dry and too much Ricotta cheese
Tierra T.,Sacramento  CA,0,3,,6/11/2015,5.0,The employees at this location always go above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of  whether you're seated at the bar or at the regular tables they are attentive to your needs. They also do an amazing job at keeping up the maintenance of the building from empty tables to the restroom. I've never had a bad experience!
Mandy D.,San Francisco  CA,87,353,204,5/26/2011,2.0,"My friend and I came here because it\'s usually her go to spot. We ordered to go. She ordered a classic baked potato with bacon and I ordered pasta with salad for lunch. They must have been having an off day since  the cashier who helped me told me that they messed up my order  so they had to redo. That was very honest and nice of her for telling me  but they forgot my side salad  so the cashier went back and got it for me. When my friend and I got back to her place  she finally checked her baked potato. For $8  she had a baked potato and bacon  that\'s it! No condiments  the usual sour cream  green onions  and butter. So much for being a ""Giant Stuffed Potato "" just a giant potato with bacon. Quite disappointing. My dish wasn\'t too tasty either. What I don\'t understand is that do they not double check their orders before putting it into the bag? Sadly  we had no utensils or napkins. The servers were nice though  just the food and what we got wasn\'t the best. I just hope it was an off day  but from reading other reviews  they are still getting the hang of things. Apparently  they have been open for two months."
Laura B.,Sacramento  CA,95,29,21,6/19/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I thought it was only fair to update my review as I was pretty tough on the restaurant (with good cause) in the first review.After being contacted by the General Manager; Nick I received a gift card in the mail to try and make up for the disastrous celebration dinner we had last week.  Yesterday 06/18/13 myself and three of my daughters went back into the restaurant for lunch. We arrived at about 12:45 after a long morning of shopping. As was the case last time our hostess was very welcoming and sweet. She said we would be seated within about 10 minutes and that was accurate. Our server was Crystal and she was an angel too!! Very friendly and engaging with my teenagers and very attentive. She made sure we had our water and drinks and kept everything refilled and had a charming demeanor. She made all the girls feel special. We all ordered lunch and I again for the sake of the experiment ordered grilled shrimp tacos. The girls ordered  chicken strips  chicken lettuce wraps & a thai salad. We also ordered an appetizer of avocado egg rolls. Everything came out in the correct order and was hot and fresh. We didn't have to wait to long at any point in the lunch. All of the lunch food was excellent and got rave reviews from the kids and my tacos were delicious! The egg rolls got only so so reviews. It was prepared and served perfectly we just didn't like the mushy texture.. Nothing but avocado and cream cheese on the inside so well  mushy. The outside was crisp and hot and fresh though. The price for lunch was a little high  about $80 so we probably wouldn't eat there all the time but my second visit really changed my mind about the restaurant.Our server Crystal really had so much to do with redeeming the restaurant. She was awesome so we left her a 20% tip and a big thank you.
Jason B.,Yuba City  CA,14,34,26,4/1/2015,4.0,Food is always good!! Dessert is really good.. service can depend on who your server is.. for the most part usually pretty good.. but sometimes u get the ones Wii aren't quit as attentive.. u realy can't go wrong with what you order!! When I'm down in Natomas this is one of the places I enjoy going!!
Mark S.,Woodland  CA,7,181,171,12/30/2013,3.0,The BJ's at the Arden Fair mall is nice; however  as with every BJ's the service is slow and not good. The beers are mediocre and the food only slightly better. I recommend trying another restaurant.
Mey S.,Sacramento  CA,35,33,57,2/23/2012,4.0,The wait is kinda long here so I suggest the call ahead service they have since they don't take reservations. I came here during night times and it's always busy.The food here is delicious. The wontons are yummy but the portion is kinda small  only 3 pieces for like under $4. The appetizer sampler is a good dish to share. I never knew avocado eggroll can taste so good too! Beware that it's spicy too! I like the variety of food they have. I had try their mini-pan pizza and the crust was very puffy  love it. The mini-pizzas are 50% off during happy hr. Also  one beer got me feeling good so the beer must be strong or I'm just weak. I've been here two times and have experienced good customer service. One time it took awhile to get our waitress' attention but she had a really nice attitude n plus it's during a busy night so I can't complain. In case you don't know  they have restrooms inside the restaurant too. My friend missed the restroom sign and went outside to the restrooms in the mall. I thought that was funny.
Patrick M.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,213,493,113,10/26/2013,3.0,Well what can you say about this place? It''s a chain that offers standard run of the mill bar and grill food. Yup that is about it. Nothing special at all about this place.The good thing is that no matter what location you go to the food is always the same and you know what you are getting when you order.As to this location it is BUSY as any location I have ever been to. The service is really horrible here.The lesson is if you are stuck and just need some generic food to fill you up this is it. Otherwise skip it and go elsewhere.
Lisa H.,Rancho Cordova  CA,124,306,17,2/22/2013,4.0,This BJ's has been a welcome addition to the Arden Fair Mall because the food options were not always so great at this mall. My kids and my mother all love eating here  so we are here fairly often. On this particular occasion we were here on President's Day for a late lunch. When we walked in we were quoted a wait of 20 minutes and they gave us a pager. This was a first for us  having to wait at this location. Once we were seated we ordered right away because everyone was hungry and close to meltdown. We ordered a large BJ's combo pizza with salads for the adults to start and applesauce for the kids. We also asked for bread to avert a crisis situation. The waitress said she could do that and we were very grateful. The pizza here is pretty good and a large leaves us with leftovers to take home to my grandmother  who also likes the pizza. The crust is very soft so it works well for kids and the elderly alike. We like it for the chunky tomato sauce and tasty toppings. Everything is pretty standard at every BJs I have ever been to  food wise. Service can be hit or miss depending on the day and your party size. On this particular day since they were so busy things were a touch slow but our server was friendly enough and accomodated our cranky kids pretty well.
M G.,Pacific Grove  CA,5,136,90,3/17/2015,5.0,Visiting Sacramento for my partners birthday!! Made a reservation for 10. Had our table ready to go and our waiter was awesome!! (forgot his name.....) We got drink orders taken right away and our orders came out promptly and everything was yummy!! Now a lot of BJ's the food is good and even the wait staff is good BUT the food takes FOREVER to come out....not here.......had a GREAT experience on a busy Saturday night!!! (March 14) Our waiter always checked on us and we were never rushed.....that was really nice!!!  Recommend this place!!!! Thank you!!!!
Rubi A.,Sacramento  CA,8,4,,10/28/2013,1.0,Worst customer service  ever. My party wasn't attended for about 20 minutes. Mind you this was around 10PM and it wasn't at all busy. We got our drinks and appetizers about another 20 minutes later. When our food finally arrived about 40 minutes later. Our food was cold and 1 of the orders were wrong. I am very disappointed in their customer service
R M.,Sacramento  CA,3,144,3,2/1/2014,4.0,Stopped in tonight after shopping  and wasPleasantly surprised with the food  since I've never really been all that impressed with it  apart from the pizookie.Everything we had tonight was great- cheese sticks  deep dish pepperoni pizza  and the Moroccan salmon were all perfectly cooked and flavorful.Will be back again soon next time we're at the mall- good service and a good experience.
Lydia P.,Santa Barbara  CA,0,36,1,5/13/2015,4.0,I seriously love this place. I come here at least once a week.I love their Pizookie  and the fact that they have a smaller portion since I can't eat a whole thing by myself. They're even willing to leave the ice cream on the side if you ask.They have an amazing cocktail menu with specialty drinks that are delicious and don't skimp on the alcohol. My personal favorite is the Irish Root Beer with their own craft root beer! And their Happy Hour rocks! $4-$5 cocktails and $6 mini deep dish pizza... You can't do much better than that!
Brandon M.,Sacramento  CA,187,190,14,7/5/2013,5.0,For a joint that is a chain  I really like BJ's....erm....brewhouse.I was there with my wife for a BOGO deal...FACEBOOK FRIEND THEM...SERIOUS GOOD DEALS.She had a pork chop  I had the salmon....not the usual fair at BJ's but we figured why not splurge with the BOGO deal. Our meals were awesome and both are highly recommended.We also ordered the corn hush puppies and corn bread....for $2.95 they are a deal and super delicious.I tried the hoppy bison  which is their IPA mixed with a stout and it tasted how it sounds...and stout with an IPA bite....meh  I would try it but not do it again.We love this place for a good meal and a decent price.
Tracy K.,Sacramento  CA,1,34,,5/8/2015,5.0,I love this restaurant! The service is always on point and the food is fresh and delicious! We had Shawn319 as our server yesterday and we really appreciated the amazing customer service! He was very attentive  friendly and a great server! We will be back soon!
Jessica C.,Sacramento  CA,2,64,69,3/2/2014,4.0,Much smaller location but the food was still great. Service wasn't over the top. My boyfriend ordered the Brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger... Honestly I couldn't tell the difference between the two but whatever  they were both good. Everything was hot when brought out and very flavorful. The pizookie of course was delishhhhh!
Blake F.,Sacramento  CA,5,21,2,3/26/2014,5.0,I have been here with friends multiple times and the food and service is always exceptional  evident of a company well managed and staffed.The Fresh Atlantic Salmon is excellent  as is the Moroccan spiced salmon plate. I love their chicken tortilla soup that is poured onto your plate right in front of you.Our last time here  our server even replaced a side dish that was perfectly made but I didn't really care for  without me having to ask. Seeing a business go above and beyond to serve their guests is refreshing and the mark of great customer service. Mr. Gary Ford is often the night manager during our visits and is always helpful in attending to any needs or requests. As a whole  their service throughout the restaurant always appears fluid and orderly.We have never had a bad experience at BJs and without hesitation they deserve 5 stars. I love dining at BJs and would even love to work there  maybe one day they'll finally hire me! Until then I'll continue enjoying their wonderful food and service at a great price.
Jason C. J.,San Francisco  CA,1474,983,608,3/27/2013,4.0,After a long day of driving from SF to Sac and then Auburn and back  my relatives and I stopped at BJ's for dinner. We were greeted and seated quickly since it was 10 something at night. Our pretty waitress  Galyna  was friendly and very patient with us since my uncle is an elderly man who is somewhat hard of hearing and loves to give servers a hard time. If our server is reading this  THANKS FOR PUTTING UP WITH US!!! xDFood:Housemade Italian MeatballsChicken Parmigiana with Spicy Marinara SpaghettiShrimp Scampi Pasta Food arrived at our table in 23 minutes since the restaurant was also pretty crowded. I think the only one complaint my relative had was for the time it took for his diet coke to be refilled. I had the berry cider  so I was okay with just one drink. Otherwise  we'd have to make many pit stops on the way back to San Francisco. Overall  great experience and kept our tummies happy.
Mike H.,Sacramento  CA,208,244,53,8/22/2013,3.0,"I LOVE the place!!! Well  from a chain perspective.. I love the resturant!We ordered food to go since we were tired from shoppin all night. To go service was slow... she was nowhere to be found for a while. Once she showed up she was super friendly and helpful. But that\'s where it ended.... the food took FOREVER... which was not her fault but the order was wrong. Not sure who\'s fault that is but either way I was unhappy that I didn\'t get what I ordered and it wasn\'t very good.Maybe just eat inside and don\'t get take out from here... you know what they say..""They F*&K you in the drive-thru"" Check your shiz before you go home! haha!! Whatever  I love this resturant and will be going back because I am a creature of habit... haha"
Jenny N.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,9/27/2015,1.0,Don't go there for sunday brunch. No coffee refill slow service. Fries came but no condiments offered. Finally got it 15 mins late.
Mary-Helen A.,Daly City  CA,168,109,12,12/3/2014,3.0,Jalapeno Burger with the Framboise Beer. Yummmmmmmmmm.
Mindy J.,Sacramento  CA,16,19,5,1/19/2015,5.0,I did the call ahead and got seated within 10 min!! We loved the fish and chips  can't wait to come back.
Justin C.,Arden-Arcade  Sacramento  CA,10,15,6,2/9/2013,1.0,My wife and I just got done driving and long drive back from Los Angeles. we ordered to New York steaks with vegetables and baked potato for takeout. we both requested for this stakes to be medium well. once we got home both steaks were very rare! plus the vegetables that are supposed to be steamed were rock hard like they just came out of the fridge. I called the manager to explain my frustration. he said that he would send me us gift card for the amount that we paid. but my wife does not want to eat there anymore. so I went in and talk to another manager and requested a refund. I told him I still have the food. He said that's not how we do things here sorry. terrible customer service  I feel like I was ripped off for 50 dollars! I am never going back there again and I will never recommend anyone to go there.Justin J C
Christian J.,Sacramento  CA,261,1,4,12/14/2012,2.0,Do not eat here if you have a large party or if you don't plan on staying here for longer than 3 hours. They don't do reservations and calling ahead doesn't seem to do you any good anyways. I called in the afternoon to set up a reservation (a service which they do not provide) and the employee told me to call 30 minutes before hand so that we would be first priority. We weren't seated until 9:30  an hour after I had originally wanted us to eat. Then it took another hour for us to receive our food and then after we ate it take another hour for us to get our checks and leave. I'm not sure what happened on this Thursday night but the service shouldn't have been this slow. We arrived at 8:30 p.m. and weren't able to leave until almost midnight. As others have reviewed previously  the food is good and the venue is nice but it's all overshadowed by the horrible waiting time.
Jewels M.,Yuba City  CA,170,38,26,11/8/2014,5.0,Bj's is truly one of my favorite restaurants! I love getting the crispy fried artichokes appetizer and then for my main dish I usually share with someone and get the amazing and tasty parmesan chicken or a deep dish  gluten free or flat bread pizza. It all matters when I'm there and who I'm with but those are my favs! I love a deal so whenever it works out I go for happy hour.They offer the California flat bread pizza (half size) for $4 and the personal mini deep dish for $6 as well as many other great options. Tip- They only have one gluten free pizza option and it's a 10 inch so when you order the mini deep dish during happy hour they'll let you order the gluten free option for the same price ($6) with any toppings you want. It's seriously the best gluten free pizza you'll ever taste. I get mine a little well done and it's almost tastes the same as their flat bread. That and they offer some pretty great happy hour drinks as well. I enjoy the ($5) lemon drop. After all or that if you didn't eat too much you have to try a pizookie! Yummy! I'm getting so hungry now! I wish I lived closer to a BJ'S location. You know it's my favorite when I drive nearly an hour just to go eat there. Side note- If you haven't done so yet I highly recommend that you sign up for their rewards card. You don't have to carry the card on you! They can look it up or if you download the app they can scan your card that way! Plus when you sign up you get a free pizookie. :DEnjoy your yummy lunch/dinner!
Jason J.,Sacramento  CA,239,142,194,4/24/2013,3.0,My first time at this location wasn't the best; the service was slow and the food was bland. Today  a colleague of mine was craving a burger and I was dying for the avocado egg rolls (which is a must have); with BJ's next door  I decided to give it another chance.We went to lunch around 1:20pm  the restaurant was pretty busy but luckily the bar was open. We were greeted right away by Amy  presenting us a with a menu. She asked us what beverages we would like to have  suggesting a variety of different beers (unfortunately we were on lunch time) and if we were ready for any starters  offering us some suggestions. We totes agreed on the avocado egg rolls  which i find the best way to start. After given time to think  I decided to get the lunch size pasta & salad. I got the house salad with blue cheese dressing and the scampi pasta. The salad was dec and the pasta was a little wet. If it wasn't for Amy and the avocado egg rolls  my rating would probably be more like 2 stars.
Sundiata C.,Sacramento  CA,1,41,,8/7/2014,2.0,I've come here before and usually get better food and service. My friends ordered some drinks  the pia coloda tasted like Benadryl. They messed up our order  were slow on the water  and then didn't speak to us after we paid; just stepped up and cleaned our table without saying a word. And there was a moth flying around our table.
Julia N.,Sacramento  CA,91,98,71,3/12/2013,5.0,I've been writing a lot of negative reviews lately  so here's a change of pace!Short: Food is always yummy  drinks are nice  service is mostly good  prices are alright. I can always count on consistency  for a chain this place is awesome! I come here because it's open late and I know its good. My absolute obsession/addiction is the Avocado Spring Rolls. OMG SO FREAKIN' GOOD. I love them  there's no denying! The creamy and fresh avocado filling that's slightly tangy with little gems of soft pine nuts in every other bite. The best part is the dipping sauce it comes with  like the sky meets the ocean and the land is born. Okay  that's a bit dramatic. But it's good  try it! Pizookie  no argument that it's amazing. I wish they had more personal sized ones though.Happy hour after 10PM means $2 off appetizers. What a coincidence  my favorite dish happens to be one! The drinks are pretty good  but don't get anything premixed. Their long island might as well be water  totally weak. The waitress said that they were all like $8-$9 but -$1 for happy hour = $9.50? Doesn't make sense  but she recommended a pretty good drink so eh  what the hell. (Peach margarita is tres bien! I think that might be French though :P)When they had the two for $20 special  we got kinda bad service. I didn't mind but my cousin stole the pizza dried pepper and cheese shakers to express her dissatisfaction. Yes  she was sober...Overall consistent  nice atmosphere  and open late. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and unwilling to drive to midtown or downtown area.
Cilla C.,Sacramento  CA,68,19,8,1/11/2015,3.0,Came here with my bf and friend . Got a good spot to sit   only waited 15-20 min . Got an appetizer of chicken wings and it sucked   had no taste at all basically plain . After got my bacon burger that was $10   didn't finish because I ate my bf $25 steak with asparagus it was good . My burger was dry had to take it home because didn't finish but overall the service was a B+ good job !
Shonda J.,Sacramento  CA,1,9,,2/4/2015,4.0,Everyone here is always so nice . I love the Parmesan chicken and the beer of course. Waiters and waitresses are always on top of things and to make my night they always give me the best pazookies.
Kandyce T.,Citrus Heights  CA,2,16,4,9/19/2014,1.0,Horrible...just horrible! I ordered clam chowder and a ceasar salad..the ceasar had absolutely no flavor and there were definitely some questionable pieces of lettuce in there. The clam chowder looked awesome but was luke warm...had our server bothered to check in with us during the meal I would have made her aware of this. I will not be back.
Jean S.,Sacramento  CA,201,243,1425,6/28/2014,2.0,I usually Love BJ's  but I did not like my last experience at this location. The main reason was the food. It didn't taste good. I always order the avocado egg rolls and chicken wings  but this time at Arden  the chicken wings did not taste right and the avocado egg rolls were not tasty at all. Not even the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was good. Usually  at any BJ's I've been to  these two orders are really delicious and flavorful  but they really sucked at Arden BJ's. The presentation was just awful too. The avocado egg rolls were ugly  very poorly cut  awfully presented  and smaller than usual! They must use bad quality ingredients too cuz the chicken just did not taste good. Furthermore  I ordered a kids meal of chicken tenders  mashed potato  milk  and a pizookie for my little boy. He ended up throwing up in the middle of the night!! And he NEVER throws up! That's how I know something was really bad at the restaurant. Be careful when dining at this BJ's. I would definitely recommend choosing a different location.
Bates B.,Sacramento  CA,2,4,,12/11/2014,5.0,I eat here often. I have found the staff very accommodating and quick to respond to special requests. Prices are very reasonable.
Jay S.,Sacramento  CA,0,41,3,3/23/2015,3.0,What a beautiful place for Sacramento! The burger was great. But the french fries were soggy. I love the selection of beers. Definitely will come back for the beers. Only problem was it was difficult to find parking close by.
Simone S.,Miami  FL,41,118,293,6/15/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Update  yesterday had a business lunch  though to give BJ's anther chance! and I tried the salmon and it was excellent!
Giana I.,Sacramento  CA,0,3,1,2/11/2015,2.0,Ughh seated ourselves  waiter told us she was too tired to care where we sat. 15 mins... Guy slams plates down literally sighs  says nothing and leavesI love bjs but the waiters here are sad.
Patti R.,Sacramento  CA,105,546,111,11/3/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Service here has really gone downhill. Forgotten items  extremely slow service  dirty utensils and health codes violations regarding serving of food items in a sanitary manner are largely ignored. Telling a mgr seems to do nothing as service is worse and worse. This is too bad as I like BJ's for their beer and food. They need to get it together....fast.
Kristie F.,Sacramento  CA,349,211,359,4/2/2011,5.0,After what seemed like MONTHS of construction  it's finally opened!I personally love BJ's for the great food and customer service and this location was no exception! Our server was super friendly and came to check up on us frequently. My friend and I came on a weekend evening and the restaurant was SUPER CROWDED  but what do you expect when its dinnertime at a mall? We were really lucky that since it was just the 2 of us  there was only a short wait.I love all the burgers here! I probably have tried every single one on the menu o__0 As a newly 21-year-old  my friend ordered me a magarita. Tip: you might not want to drink the magarita first before the food comes out because you might get a little intoxicated ... hahaha. The magarita was $9 thought. A little pricey to me... 5 stars nonetheless! :]
Natalie C.,San Ramon  CA,130,24,,11/11/2014,5.0,Thank you To the waitress with the first name beginning with an A For your excellent service! Its veterans day and you made us feel welcome! We sat outside to dine and the atmosphere was pleasant with the heaters on. The fried chicken was surprisingly delicious. The meat was juicy and tender so the cook did ab excellent job because usually fried chicken tastes dry in other places.
Kristina F.,Woodland  CA,144,345,205,12/12/2012,4.0,The food is standard  the beer is great  and if you're out on a weekend without a place to go around Arden late night with friends  BJ's is open late! They have small bites from $3 and up to go with your adult beverage.I had a drink called the Strawberry Patch  it had bicardi in it and tasted really watered down.  Nice dim lighting. Efficient customer service.
Charmayne Y.,Vallejo  CA,377,80,127,12/6/2012,3.0,I used to frequent this particular BJ's on my lunches and after work and there are several menu items that are wonderful. The chicken teriyaki (I add in shrimp since I'm a foodie) and it is incredible. Perfectly seasoned and the flavor is great. Be warned the serving size is outta control and even at lunch  once  three of us shared it and it was perfect with a few appetizers.  Only reason for star deduction is that sometimes it can be noisy- yes I know it's a brewhouse. But it is a great place to watch games and enjoy a beverage. I've tried several and have never been disappointed. Also  there have been times when the soup for the soup and salad isn't hot. Not sure if it's because the bowl is cold when the tortilla soup is brought out but that is a missed opportunity there. Otherwise  I say go and enjoy!
Michelle M.,Sacramento  CA,227,592,2672,5/4/2011,4.0,Great food !! there is wait time if you go during rush hour but it's worth it.
Amy R.,Saint Paul  MN,89,311,21,4/16/2011,4.0,Decent food and service. The restaurant had a nice cozy feeling. It's at Arden Fair mall  so parking is what it is. Shockingly  it wasn't packed like the one in Natomas.The lighting in the place was a bit weird at lunch time. Alot of glare coming in the front windows made the front booths difficult to see across to the other side of the booth. And maybe I'm just getting old  but the music was a little loud. Don't get me wrong  I enjoy listening to Axl Rose screech about Paradise City  but I'd rather that the server be able to understand my order more.Definitely will go back and try the Happy Hour specials.
Emma K.,Sacramento  CA,2,2,3,7/10/2014,1.0,DO NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR. I called ahead for two tables 3 people and 2 people. We told them about call ahead the said 10 minutes for 2 people 15 minutes for 3. We then dat their and watched people who came in after us get seated before us. I go up and ask them if our tables are almost ready. They tell us your table is being cleaned. Five minutes later I ask about our table they tell us the same thing. At this point my entire party is really ticked off and annoyed and then they tried to seat my parents at a horrible table and wouldnt move them. Moral of the story don't go to this BJs unless you have tons of time to sit around be ignored and wait.
Karina V.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,12/22/2015,5.0,I went in on Monday night (party of 5). We definitely got the best service we could have ever asked for. Our server Josh met all our needs! We never had to ask for refills on our drinks or wait around with empty cups for him to come around to refill. Will definitely be going back to this location and asking for him to be my server  and hopefully he will be my server every time I go in to eat at this location.
Vanessa C.,Elk Grove  CA,3,23,8,9/27/2013,1.0,Came here for dinner  wait wasn't too bad for two  about 25 minutes. Got seated and waited about 15 minutes just to see our sever and order drinks. When we finally got our drinks and food we sat there for 20 minutes trying to flag someone down for a refill. Food was very bland  my tomato soup consisted of all olive oil. The Cesar salad tasted nothing like Cesar. Overall Service sucked Food suckedHad a much better experience at Elk Grove BJs
Jolanne T.,Sacramento  CA,0,16,1,6/11/2012,2.0,So  I've been the main caregiver for my mom for the past few months and tonight my nieces came over to give me a break. I said I was going to Arden Fair to look at the new Apple Computers and then I really wanted pizza and beer. They said go to BJ's. I sat for about 5 minutes before the waitress came over. She brought me water and a menu. I politely asked for lime for my water. About 7 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a drink. I asked for a long island and for lime one more time. Another 7 minutes later  I went up to the bar and got my own lime! I was halfway through my water when she finally came by with lime!!!I ordered a mini pizza  light sauce. Receive a pizza with no sauce. The long island tasted more like sweet and sour and triple sec.My waitress did check on me once after she tried to give me two other peoples bills. It's been a long process of taking care of my mom and I am grateful to be able to do so  but I just needed an evening where someone waited on me. I soooo didn't get that at BJ's. Decided to go home and make my own drink and sit outside. Saved money and enjoyed the atmosphere ten times better!One last point. I was sitting where many of the wait staff were coming and going. One  just one smiled back at me when we made eye contact. I am a former bar and restaurant owner and CUSTOMER SERVICE is a MUST.
Gina H.,Sacramento  CA,0,14,,7/18/2015,5.0,Hannah was the best waitress! Great food. Great turn around. Always happy to come by.
Menoride Y.,Sacramento  CA,8,64,2,8/5/2013,4.0,You can never go wrong with burgers at BJ's. Pizzas are good too for large party. They have many beers on tap. I go on a binge here sometimes but not with their home brew though. Their brew tend to make me sleepy (too much hop?)Sign up for their membership program. It's a great deal. You'll get many free offers in e-mail. Then check-in with your member code every time you eat here to get reward points. Too bad alcohols don't count. :(Tell them it's your birthday to get a free pizooki. Go ahead. They don't check.
Mr M.,Sacramento  CA,5,9,,1/20/2015,5.0,Fav restaurant and the scooby snack are awesome green shot drinks u can take their AT the bar. 10$ a shot.
Tammy R.,Rocklin  CA,1,23,16,2/15/2014,1.0,I'm completely stunned that a chain of this caliber would allow a dish to go out on the floor looking like mine did. I guess you *barely* get what you pay for. Coworkers and I had lunch here and 2 of us orders the lunch Brewhouse burger. It came to the table looking like a regurgitated piece of meat. We all thought it looked like it had been dropped in the floor a few times (pics posted). My friends burger looked similar  but  his was less noticeable covered in melted cheese. Not a big fan of this place anyway  now  I will definitely never return. The cooks should watch the food channel to understand how presentation can affect someone's order. Horrible!
Sandy T.,San Francisco  CA,303,373,418,9/16/2012,4.0,Got the $19.99 dinner for two (2 salads or soup  pizza  and a pizookie)  an order of pasta  crispy calamari  and another salad for 4. We were well fed and had two slices of pizza and some pasta leftoverCRISPY CALAMARI[+] was delicious! No wonder it's the signature appetizer[+] two sauces for dip[+] and there's lemon slices to add flavor!TUSCAN CHICKEN LIMONE PASTA[+] chicken was soft and tender[+/-] was pretty good  but not very memorable[-] pasta lacked flavorBACON CHEESEBURGER PIZZA[+] tastes JUST like a cheeseburger![+] a burger pizza!? The flavors worked well[+] and there's BACONPIZOOKIE[+] a soft freshly baked cookie[+] various kinds of cookies of your choice[+] with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top! YummmmI don't go to BJ's often but when I do  I always get the pizookie.But really  you can't really go wrong with this place. It's a good group dinner place and there's something on the menu for everyone. And it tastes pretty good!
Candace T.,Newark  CA,3,18,,10/13/2014,5.0,Went with my son and granddaughter on a Saturday around 5pm. It was packed because of the Giants playoff game so everyone was in a great mood. The food was SUPERB! Had the combo sampler appetizer  then I had the shrimp scampi which was the best I've ever had and I've been to a LOT of restaurants. My granddaughter had the Parmesan crusted chicken that was HEAVENLY...lightly cooked and seasoned. Then we had a half salted carmel  half chocolate chip PIZZOOKIE and it was sooooooo goooood and gooey! All around best dinner I've had in a while. :-) Service was great.
Michelle K.,Montgomery  AL,9,12,1,6/1/2014,5.0,I love their pazookies. The revolving door in the front is annoying but they have good service and after I go shopping I always end up here.
D S.,Redding  CA,2,13,,10/7/2013,4.0,Best pizza in Sacramento!We only wish we had a BJ's in Redding  so we could have it more often.
Aman G.,Roseville  CA,11,24,4,8/26/2014,3.0,The food is decent  (the ones in Roseville and Natomas are way better) but the service really sucks. I had to ask 4 different waiters for ranch multiple times and still never got any. They messed up my order too and were not attentive.
Amy A.,West Sacramento  CA,1,38,,9/27/2015,2.0,Our first visit today. Extremely slow and uninterested service. Our server didn't seem to care about our table at all. Our beers took forever to arrive  and we had to ask where they were. The food was mediocre. The sliders--WOW  I have had better presented dishes at 3 am at Denny's. The artichoke appetizer was borderline burnt. We were very disappointed in both the service and the food. Prices were high considering the quality and lack of style as far as presentation. I have written an online note to the corporate office -- I am hoping to hear back. The table next to us was having problems too  with their food taking forever to arrive. Servers-- when people have kids  please don't take forever to bring the food. At least offer some bread if the kitchen is slow. Please.
Jessica S.,Sacramento  CA,26,123,2,5/4/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,It's been awhile since I've been to this location. I was disappointed the waiter  waitress was too confusing we had 3 of them tell us they were are waiter.The Resturant was so cold by the time I got my food took my first bite my food was cold. I wasn't able to enjoy my food.
D C.,Fairfield  CA,1,21,4,9/21/2014,3.0,I go to BJ's a lot. Every single time I leave satisfied. However  I usually go to the one in Vacaville because it's closer. Last night  I came here with my boyfriend after walking the mall. It was around 10 pm and it was pretty busy for a Friday night. We got seated quickly and we met our server. She was really nice and was definitely one of the best servers I've ever had out of all the ones that I've been to. I ordered a top sirloin with a baked potato and caesar salad. I got the salad first and it was okay. It was kind of sour and some pieces of lettuce were pretty limpy. I didn't get a lot of croutons either  but whatever. When I got the sirloin and baked potato  the meat looked dry and the potato was just warm. I didn't complain too much about the potato because it was soft enough but the meat kinda bothered me a little bit. I usually cut the top sirloin into bite-sized pieces but this portion was really tough. There were some dry and chewy parts  but there were some softer and juicier parts too. I don't know  it kinda felt like the meat was just reheated. It should've been a lot better than that considering it's around $13.So  the only thing that really pissed me off was a customer. I know BJ's can't control the customers they get but this one guy was out of control. It seemed like he was drunk  but he was talking really loud and he said some inappropriate things. Shouldn't he have been kicked out by then? I looked at some of the families around us and they didn't look too happy since they had kids with them. I was hoping that a server or the manager would tell him to keep it down - especially since so many servers walked by. Instead  a server kept bringing him beer and his actions got worse and worse. Yeah  it was already pretty loud in there but the things he said should not have been heard across the room. The servers just seemed to laugh it off  too. Don't hate the guy  just wish the employees did something about his actions.
Alex T.,Sacramento  CA,1312,990,6375,5/26/2014,4.0,came here for theur happy hour which wasnt bad. 5 bucks for any pizza is a deal. also ordered a mix drink berry mojito which was bad the alcohol was so low and the sweetness was like way too sweet most likely wont order a drink unless its a shot or beer. the service was great and attentive. will be bacm again.
Elif F.,Sacramento  CA,266,167,3,1/12/2012,1.0,Never again. Look don't promise you are going to sit a large group in 15 minutes and then an hour later say...sorry the party at your table  which there are only two left are changing a baby's diaper  you have to wait until they leave. The table was empty. And then we waited another 20 minutes. An hour and 20 minutes to sit down to eat after being told 15 minutes  getting really rude attitude from the front receptionist ladies  and then the food comes out wrong. Nope  didn't think you were that fantastic to begin with  now  NEVER again. I'm going to tell everyone know not to go here.
Vicky Z.,Huntington Beach  CA,257,381,145,12/3/2012,4.0,Co-workers and I planned on ordering the salmon  but when the time came  my fatty side won over. I ordered the Mini Pizza w/ olives & house salad. The house salad was better than expected and the pizza was big enough for two meals. My co-worker's shoestring fries stood out as the favorite.I'm not a big fan of chains  but I would consider coming back for this lunch special.
Robert R.,Sun City  CA,37,231,2,3/31/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,One thing I've noticed that is common for all BJ's is SLOW service  and this place is no exception to that rule. If it weren't for the decent beer  I would not eat at BJs as often as I do. The menu selection is good but one can grow quickly tired of it; the food is good but not great. I must say that the pizza is better than average.On my last visit  they had immediate seating but offered me to sit in the bar area if I wanted. I said sure  that sounded great. I went to the bar area and they were completely full (you would think that they would be aware of this before asking me). So I returned to the hostess and then they told me I would have to wait 15 minutes for a table---even though they misinformed me! There were empty tables. So I left. Screw that!
Steve L.,Sacramento  CA,101,324,1,3/17/2012,2.0,BJ's  the brewhouse with the unfortunate name  is big on theme  which is alcohol. Mirrored shelves of hard liquor rise high above the bar  gleaming like the church of DUI. When we sat down as a family for brunch  our server asked if we wanted to start with Midori Sours. Um  no  dear - especially not the 13-year old.Speaking of service  turns out BJ's isn't so big on that. Ten minutes and counting before anybody stopped by to say hello. And while our server was keen on upselling us to liquid lunches  she didn't bring water or a sweetner tray for coffee and tea (we heisted one from another server)  and her delivery of condiments consisted of slamming down a plastic catsup bottle on the table.On to the food - okay  I guess. Our son really liked his bacon cheeseburger and fries  and the wife thought her turkey club with avocado was good. I had a breakfast pizza - flatbread and marinara sauce topped by what was alleged to be a sausage and mozzarella omelette. Let's just say the flavors were elusive.BJ's is nothing more than another mediocre chain where employees try really hard to sling drinks. No reason to make a special trip to a place like this. I wish California Cafe' was still there.
Victoria S.,Gilroy  CA,13,11,2,11/20/2013,1.0,"I attempted to visit this restaurant on Friday 11/15 and when I entered I was created by no one. I stood there with my friend and neither or I was acknowledged; needless to say after 10 minutes of standing there. ( I even walked up to the host and attempted to talk with her.) I left the restaurant and went elsewhere. The next day on 11/16 I was in the Arden area again  I decided many the previous day was probably just a special circumstance so my Aunt and I decided to take lunch at BJs again. I assumed it would be busy so we arrived there about 1:20. When we got there my Aunt asked for sitting outdoor because we were on a schedule and the hostess flat out refused us. She said ""No~ you have to wait 10 to 15 minutes to be seated out there."" Neither of us understood why because there were only 2 tables occupied in the outdoor area. Finally at 1:45 we were called to be seated  I remember because by this time I was saying ""okay well if they take any longer we will just leave."" Specifically we were never told the wait would be longer than 10 - 15 minutes so when it changes to 20-25 minutes the Host should let people know. Anyways  we handed her back our buzzer and she told us Amy would take us to a table. So we went to the backside of the Hostess booth and stood there  waiting  waiting and waiting. Again  no acknowledgement and there was a woman standing there  she just stared at us like we were crazy. Until finally my Aunt asked  ""So is anyone going to seat us?"" The woman who was standing there; who I am assuming was the manager on duty ( she was in a chambray (denim colored) button down shirt and she had short brown hair) was flippant and rude in her answer. She was like "" Well did someone call your number?"" and I was like "" Yeah we gave her the buzzer and she told us someone would seet us."" Then suddenly a girl in a black cardigan came rushing in from nowhere before the ""manager woman"" said anything else and fumbled grabbing menus as she herded us out to a table. As we were walking away the manager woman felt the need to add in a sarcastic tone  ""Have a great lunch."" We were made to squeeze between the chairs of other customers to even be able to reach a table and those customers already seated as well. We were finally seated at 1:50; the girl told us our waiter would be with us soon and she quickly left. We looked over the menu for awhile deciding what we wanted; we had decided on appetizers  pizza and we were going to get a few drinks. So we waited and waited; again I didn\'t understand what was going on because the waitress was outside helping other tables and taking drink orders and she never even acknowledged us to tell us she would be with us soon. Finally after 10 mins; at 2:00 we gave up and left. So much for that  I was extremely disappointed because I had really wanted the food and wanted to try a new beer. Needless to say I don\'t think I will come back to this BJs.Two-days in a row experiencing bad service doesn\'t seem like a coincidence. I don\'t think I can even call that bad service because it is more like no service. I ended up leaving on both occasions. The restaurants I went to afterward were just as busy  acknowledged me once I entered the door  sat me within the quoted time and had a waiter at my table in a reasonable amount of time. I\'m not going to go back to your BJs because I don\'t want to waste my time in a establishment where I\'m not going to end up eating and I\'m not going to go somewhere that has a manger that acts so rudely with customers. I\'m definitely going to be telling others about this experience. No one else should waste their time through that  which is sad because other than service the establishment is good."
Ami F.,Roseville  CA,4,22,,9/5/2014,4.0,Small restaurant but very good food. The drinks are really strong  but the best pulled pork that i have had at any BJ's.
Daniel D.,Concord  CA,826,461,314,1/19/2012,3.0,I came here on Sunday night after an event across the street at the Double Tree. I think it's nice that it's open late  there wasn't much of a wait around 10pm but when we came during the day to visit the mall  the wait looked horrible and parking wasn't very easy.Honestly? I'm over BJ's currently. I've went a few times recently to different locations and every time it's been underwhelming. The food is about the same but service has been bad. Maybe it's just me? I'm not sure anymore. There was really just one error this time.I'm not going to do a full review on this place  just highlight the ups and downs.-- G O O D ---- No wait-- Food was decent-- Water glass kept full :)-- Pizookie is BOMB-- B A D ---- Specifically asked for HOT fries with my chili cheese burger. They were COLD. So I had to ask for some new ones -_-
Bri R.,Sacramento  CA,1,7,9,1/27/2012,1.0,"Where do I start? We called the day of to reserve a spot for 10 people for a friend\'s a party. We were told that we could only schedule reservation 45 minutes BEFORE the time! How crazy is that? We called at 5pm and reserved our spot for 5:45pm. I got there at 5:30pm and was told it would be a short wait. Fine  that\'s okay  I was early anyway. At 6:45pm I WENT OFF! I let the receptionist and the servers hear it. \'They know how to make the reservation  but they don\'t know how to HOLD the reservation! The holding is the most important part!\' (Jerry Seinfeld). When we finally were seated (7:03pm) our server had the WORST attitude. She didn\'t even take our drink orders until 23 minutes later. We told her that the checks and orders needed to be separate (so everyone could pay for their own food) and she told us they didn\'t do that! That way the servers get better tips.When we finally received our ""food"" (8:19pm) almost all our orders were wrong! When we told her she smacked her lips and snatched the food from the tables. RIDICULOUS!!! I was pissed so I gave her an ear full when she came back. A different server brought us the correct food and when I bit into it  it was like eating a sand burger from the desert... DRY  DRY  DRY! He brought us EMPTY ketchup and mustard bottles  yes  empty and took 7 minutes to bring us new ones. THEY NEVER REFILLED OUR DRINKS... NOT EVEN THE WATER.They food was NOT worth the wait or price at all. They over charged us because they confused our table with the group next to us.Also  it was sooo cold and dark in that place. I understand setting the mood  but when you have customers everywhere WEARING COATS  GET THE HINT! I didn\'t take off my coat; I put my gloves on while waiting. It was so dark we used our cell phones as a source of light for ordering. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BJS AGAIN... NEVER... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE... I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT MCDONALDS!"
Jeremy H.,Sacramento  CA,88,124,54,1/26/2013,2.0,"2 Stars in Yelp reads ""Meh. I\'ve experienced better"" and that pretty much sums it up. I feel like there are a ton of restaurants just like this one and we\'re all pretty used to them... sure there menu item differences  but I swear they all get their food from the same cheap vendor... whoever that is.Ordered a thin crust pizza  note the ""Thin"" in that description because apparently BJ\'s has no idea whatsoever that means... or maybe I don\'t. I always imagined thing meaning skinny or not thick. If I saw a person walking and said they looked incredibly thin you\'d imagine my description there (skinny or not thick). BJ\'s thin crust pizza is thicker than most other regular pizzas I have ever eaten... and I\'m an American which means I\'ve eat an ungodly amount of pizza in a proportion that could probably feed a small village in some other countries.If you like thick pizza where most of what you get is doe then you\'ll love this place.So we did a custom pizza and one ingredient was white onions. I imagined that these would be chopped up or something. I mean  of course they didn\'t put an entire onion on the pizza  but there was only a few slices of onion and these things were like an entire leaf of union... probably there was about 3 of these leafs spread over the whole pizza and they were each about 3 inches by 3 inches.The salad was even more awful... or rather pathetic. It was like they knew it was bad so they just gave up trying and just threw some cheap green stuff they could find  threw it on a place  and sprayed it with some flavorless dressing.I would have given this place 1 star  but low and behold there was one good thing about this place that was worth an entire star. The beer. I only had one  it was some waste of money expensive special  but I had to have something to wash all their garbage down with  so I got it. Can\'t remember what it was  but it was dang good.If I was BJ\'s  and I\'m not  nor will I ever name my child anything with that acronym in it  I would make the beer the main focus and food a side note. Though  maybe that\'s why I don\'t own any restaurants because that place is always packed even though I hated the food - so apparently a lot of people out there still love this junk."
Carlos G.,Las Vegas  NV,5,30,1,5/28/2012,4.0,Never been here before and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is nice. Service was not bad  food was good and hanging here with friends was ideal. Over all  satisfied and will return. 
Laura S.,Sacramento  CA,64,25,5,10/16/2011,2.0,"I was excited to go here  as many ppl have said how much they like it  and this place is fairly new to the Arden Mall. I wanted to go to Elephant Bar  but my boyfriend convinced me we should go here instead.Saturday night  around 9  we get there and put our name on the list  them saying bout a 20 min wait. Many couples that got there after us were being seated  so we were like  what\'s the deal??? They kept saying like you\'re next  soon  blah blah. A little annoying... they finally  at 9:25 called my name with ""party of 4""....clearly we were a party of 2.....that\'s why that took so long. okay  no problem. it happens.our host wasn\'t too pleasant  she seemed annoyed at US  when we said we were only two people.I decided what I wanted quickly (Italian Market Salad) looked pretty good. My bf decided on pulled pork sandwich.Took a while for the waitress  also she was making me feel awkward  to come back with the waters we ordered and then again to come back for our orders  but it was pretty busy  so that\'s okay.Ordered our food. got excited  i was starving! took 25 min to get our food. im not sure if it seemed longer cause i was hella hungry  but it was a little bit of a wait. and................ WHOMP WHOMP  my salad was so tiny!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I order a 12 dollar salad  I expect not to be able to finish it. I cleared the plate in 7 minutes! Still hungry :/also  too much dressing. drenched. but besides that  a pretty good salad  i liked that it had a lot of kalamata olives  usually ppl skimp on those.my bf\'s pulled pork pretty good. standard pulled pork. mashed potatoes yummy as well the crispy fries.left unsatisfied. SUM UP:Lame salad portionslow servicetasty foodawkward staff"
C K.,Sacramento  CA,0,6,,8/1/2015,5.0,I had absolutely wonderful customer service today at curbside from Ben!! He was nice and on top of everything! He is a great example of how people in the food/service industry should be! Thank you!
Chad L.,Carmichael  CA,12,17,60,12/14/2013,2.0,Most recent visit was on a slammed night where we had at least 3 servers visit our table after waiting too long for the initial greet. I have been served consistently lukewarm pizza and have sent it back for a quick flash more than once. When we were served  the pizza came before the salad and we had to ask for utensils. Sent the Cobb Salad back.The service is always patient and agreeable  which makes it all the more disheartening that I am not sure how much more of their mediocre food I can handle. This place is a dressed up frat bar  and despite the slick interiors and uniformed staff  it has become a so-so stop for overpriced mall food. I have had better dishes at Lyons  particularly in the salads and apps dept. The manager was quick and attentive and could have sealed the deal with a comp'ed Pazookie but I couldn't get out of there fast enough :/
Christine D.,Crockett  CA,116,304,132,4/12/2014,3.0,Not bad for a chain restaurant bar establishment! large menu selection food is average service is ok. Service can be a little slow when it busy  but I guess that's expected. Portions are big!
Ann S.,Sacramento  CA,47,40,,7/31/2011,1.0,"I\'ve read about this restaurant in China  I think it is  where everything is made out of ice. The tables  the chairs  the bar. You go in in your parka and sit there and eat on blocks of ice in a below freezing atmosphere. People voluntarily go there  but what\'s in it for the restaurant? Does shivering make everything taste good? Does it change your metabolism so you order more? Perhaps customers want to get out so fast that they don\'t care what is put in front of them  and will pay anything on the bill?Maybe that\'s BJ\'s philosophy. When I walked into the Arden Fair restaurant on a pleasant 90 degree evening last Wednesday  I felt like I was entering that Chinese ice cafe. BJs was seriously over air-conditioned  and I\'m talking freon gone wild.  I\'m sorry I don\'t carry a portable thermometer with me  because I\'ll bet it wasn\'t more than 65 degrees.  I was so uncomfortable that I wrapped one of their cloth napkins around my shoulder and vowed from now on to keep a pashmina in the car  even during summer in Sacramento.The menu was as expected for this class of restaurant - a little bit of everything: pasta  fish  burgers  ribs. Usually  when a restaurant has a lot of choices  they are good at nothing. We went because I heard they had decent ribs and my 14 year old son loves ribs.You hear a lot of things in this world that aren\'t true  don\'t you?The wait to be seated was short  but service was very slow  which is to be expected when the floors are iced down. The restaurant looks nice  with few remnants of the California Cafe left. But  it is a bit more handsomely appointed than necessary for what is essentially a family restaurant. My kid ordered the ribs  and my husband and I both ordered a French Dip sandwich. They asked me if I wanted ""skinny"" fries or steak fries. Since I don\'t like fries much  I said skinny. I would have switched to a salad but I\'m neutropenic from chemo and am not supposed to have fresh veggies  and aside from that  they wanted to charge $3.00 extra. I\'ll stick with skinny fries  thanks. After a long  long wait  long enough so that after 20 minutes  my husband still had time to walk all the way across the Arden Fair parking lot  behind Nordstrom and back to bring me my forgotten phone - they finally brought our meal. Only  I got ""fat"" steak fries. Which I really didn\'t want  so I asked to switch to what I\'d ordered. By then I had a craving for skinny  salty  almost potato-less fries to dip in the au jus. The server said they\'d bring me some skinny ones right out  so I unloaded my fat ones on my husband and kid.The slab of ribs was unremarkable. The sauce was boring. It came with a baked potato  which my kid doesn\'t care for (good thing I got the wrong fries so he had mine) and only about a tablespoon of butter and sour cream mixed together in a tiny cup. Weird way to save money but I guess they have to pay for the air-conditioning somehow.He did get a salad with it which he liked - it had hidden valley ranch dressing on it  he thought. It looked like a bagged salad with croutons.My sandwich was ice cold  which was not unbelievable given the temperature of the restaurant and the long wait - if it had ever been warm enough  that is. The roast beef was your typical packaged roast beef and maybe had just been pulled out of the fridge and slammed on to bread and served with fat fries.Nobody ever brought me my skinny fries or checked on us. Oddly enough  while this entire experience took an hour an a half  at the very end the busser picked up my plate WHILE I WAS STILL EATING. Service was very very slow until they decided we were done.I didn\'t protest because it wasn\'t very good and the icey temperature had gotten to me. When she came to give us the bill  I complained that\'d I\'d not gotten half my meal and expected that to be taken off.The restaurant did one thing right - they took my entire meal off.My son had been eyeing the desserts  but the whole thing took so long and we were so cold that we skipped it.And  we\'ll skip them forever  since we won\'t be back.This is on par with Elephant Bar  Applebees  Chilis etc: Chain restaurants with mediocre food. Kids like these places because they have lots of choices and bland food  and adults seem to like them because they are predictable; you know what you are getting no matter what state you order it.So  if you like terrible service  freezing temperatures and blah food  you\'ll adore BJs - in any part of the world."
Christine Q.,Sacramento  CA,5,27,6,2/5/2012,5.0,I absolutely love this place! I've been here for dinner and lunch times. Their good is delicious. I have ordered  their pizza with my siblings  and cousin. We had pizza  i believe it was the pig something. icant remember  but it was like a hawaiian pizza. The crust  was not like a normal crust  it was nice and fluffy crust. The cheese was right  as the pig was nice and had a good amount of sweet taste. The pineapple had added the right amount is a slight tang that meld with the pig. That night we had a poozkie. The poozkie we ordered was a normal size  that was vanilla ice cream. Their vanilla ice cream was so GOOD!  the cookie was very sweet to my taste. IT was GOOD!. The second time that i went with my friends. I had ordered a fish and chips at this location for lunch. Their fish i wished was more crispy and fully cooked. The batter seemed as it wasn't fully cooked. I was happy that lemon was included in this dish  because it helped cut the oil taste. The fries were good  but i had wished it was alittle bit more crispier. The sauce for the fish  which was tarter sauce was good  it has a nice good tart/sour taste. BUT i can tell you that my 3 other friends enjoyed their own meals. we had the appetizers and it was good  we had the sample platter that so we tired everything  i loved the dips  and umm.... it was an eggroll  but it wasnt the avocado ones. I can't really remember the name.The third time that i went was with my friends as well. I had a hard time deciding what to order  but umm the server had help me decided on what was ordered on more.( this was at the location in arden mall) I ordered the chicken crusted parmasean with mashed potatoes. It was the most crispy chicken ever!. The chicken was amazingly good. Their mashed potatoes were good  but i loved the chicken more. my friend loved their dishes and it was fabulous.I loved all these times  and it was really good. I loved to come back for food.
VeeVee N.,Fresno  CA,49,620,11423,5/9/2012,3.0,Ate here while in town and was surprised to see that their menu varied slightly from the one in my home town. I was craving Broccoli-Cheddar Soup but much to my disappointment  they only serve it Sun  Mon and Tue. They also didnt have the Onion Strings on the appetizer menu  as well as other choices. The food was good  although it was extremely loud and we had to repeat our order/requests several times to our waitress.
Gilly C.,Sacramento  CA,21,12,1,8/16/2014,5.0,Yup! Our spot! Child friendly. Yummi pizza and hamburgers. Love the peanut butter pizuki. Wedge salad is very nice! We've never been disappointed with the food or the service.
Jenise H.,Fair Oaks  CA,12,7,,1/20/2014,4.0,I love Bj's a lot. Come here as often as possible and tonight I didn't have the greatest experience with one of the servers(he didn't introduce himself  my soup was cold  he basically threw my new reheated soup at me  didn't make eye contact) just not up to the usual Bj's standard I am accustom to. Thankfully  however  Amy the manager was very graceful and amazing with the way she handled the situation. I totally understand why she's the manager. Thank you so much  Amy. You were amazing
Danny H.,Memphis  TN,70,158,41,7/2/2011,2.0,The food was good but the service was horrible. I went today for a late lunch around 3PM. It wasn't very busy at all and we were seated right away. It took about 7 to 10 minutes for us to even be greeted at our table. Of course by that time we were ready to order food. It took another 15 minutes for us to even get our drinks. We got our food about five minutes before our food arrived  which were the deep dish pizzas! I actually had to remind our server about our drinks as she was walking around laughing with co-workers! We then had to ask for refills many times and even for silverware to eat off of. Our server was very inattentive. Makes me not want to return!
Sarah W.,Columbus  OH,1,6,,8/4/2015,5.0,Good establishment. If you are ever torn between here or TGIFriday  come here instead because you will actually get service!
Kitty T.,Sacramento  CA,0,26,2,8/3/2013,1.0,Recently visited with a friend and used a gift card. The bill totaled up to just a few dollars over the value of the gift card  so I slipped in a $20 since I needed to break it anyways. When the waitress returned with my change  I discovered that in fact  there was no change.. What!? She took all the cash and left some $19 on the gift card. When I asked her about it  she had a terrible attitude and made a big deal about it as if I was making a huge inconvenience. Why would I go in with a gift card and then want to give you cash so I could keep the most value possible on the gift card?!?! .. Then she took forever to (finally!) bring my change.I normally like BJs  but will not be returning to this location because of the rude service.
Karl P.,Sacramento  CA,1237,121,2,1/15/2012,4.0,I don't always like chains  but this is a good one. This particular BJ's has a smaller  nicer dining area than most. That makes it a great place for one-on-one discussions and a cozy date.All BJ's have a great menu with a wide variety of options.They have a good bar and  of course  their own brand of beers. Whether you're blonde  brunette  or redhead  you can order a beer named after your hair color. It doesn't get better than that!
Rene L.,Sacramento  CA,735,429,193,6/28/2011,5.0,i don't care that it's in Arden Mall. i could give 2 Sh$%s the food is generic and processed. i'll even tolerate crowds if i have to.i'm here for the Wyder's pear CIDER on tap!!!$5.50 pints for happy hour in the bar area drew me in like a bug zapper.  when sitting at the bar the bartenders have always been on it with pint refills and food orders. servers are a little slower when you're sitting in the bar booths  but nothing compared to the turtle race in the regular dining area...happy hoursm-f 3pm-7pmsun-thurs 10pm-midnight
Kathy N.,Sacramento  CA,105,112,31,10/17/2011,3.0,Never been to BJ's prior to my first visit & honestly  i dont understand what the hypes all about cause it was alright..They had the slowest service ever!! took maybe 20 to 30 minutes for our food to be ready  and it sucked cause we were hungry! It seemed like other people that came in after us got their food first -_-. We ordered fettucini  mac and cheese  a pizza  and this rice thingy( it looked like chinese food  idk what it was called)...they all tasted good  but NOT mouth watering good haha. Bill came out kinda expensive  and we were all full by then to try out their pizookie cookie. IDK if i'll return  maybe...
Lydia T.,Elk Grove  CA,18,51,2,4/5/2015,1.0,My boyfriend and I came here on a whim since we were hungry and didn't go to Maggiano's for some strange reason. There wasn't a wait and we sat down in one of the quieter areas. Our waitress was extremely friendly and kind to us but I forgot her name! My bf ordered the fish & chips and I ordered the top sirloin medium w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus. My bf said his dish was good but mine was far from it. The steak was cooked beyond well done and the waitress knew there was an issue even though she was standing on the other side of the room. She came over  asked if it was too well-done (I didn't even ask for it well done)  apologized and took it back. The steak looked over cooked and shriveled. Manager Sean came & apologized and asked if I wanted a soup or salad to enjoy while I waited. I got a salad which was nice. The new steak took like 15 minutes to come out even after like 5 different servers came over and said it was on it's way & it was a top priority........ THE SECOND STEAK WAS STILL WELL DONE. Of course it would be well done if I waited 15 minutes for it. You had TWO chances to make a medium steak and failed so hard. What. The. Heck. My asparagus was sticking half off the plate because they brought my new meal on some dinky little plate. The asparagus was wayyy too salty and old. I tried to cut the old parts off but every time I did the top portion would fall off the plate. What a waste. The steak was tough and well done but I ate it. It was so tiny  maybe 6 oz? At that point I was so hungry and fed up that I lied to our waitress and said everything was fine when she came over. The only good part about my dish was the mashed potatoes. For $14 I could've gotten a nicer  bigger  and perfectly cooked steak from Texas Roadhouse. The waitress offered us a free pizookie to make up for the first mistake which was very kind of her. There was also a guy cleaning up the cups from tables and was clearly trying to carry too much on his tray because he ended up spilling it on himself and near another occupied table. He dropped the F-bomb and he wasn't very quiet about it. Kinda unprofessional. What a disappointing and unsatisfying experience at BJ's... I do have to say thank you to our waitress and the manager for treating us well. We left a 20% tip despite the issues and hope that it goes straight to our waitress.
Nancy D.,Sacramento  CA,26,15,7,4/18/2014,4.0,GreAt place for food and drinks . Their deserts are awesome . Especially the pizookies with ice cream
Heather C.,Sacramento  CA,397,218,172,11/2/2011,5.0,Wanna go shopping drunk??DONT want to go shopping but your wife/girlfriend/sister/friend is begging you and you would rather get DRUNK?Need to get your oil changed and told you have to wait over an hour and have nothing to do.....well walk to BJ's ingeniously located in the Arden mall and get....DRUNK! =)BJ's is most definateley my favorite chain restaurant. They have a full bar  delicious beers  cheap and tasty appetizers  a huge variety of entrees and when you are a fan of BJ's on facebook you are always getting printable coupons. Now the best part about THIS BJ's is that it is conveniently located close to my house which means happy hour is always around the corner  and if there ever comes a time when I have had one too many and cant drive just yet  I can burn the calories and the buzz off by shopping or people watching in the mall. Its pretty much a win win here. But of course you could always just go to Bj's and have a good dinner..I do realize not everyone is as much of an alcoholic as I  Bj's is good for an old fashioned sober lunch/dinner as well.
Niki C.,Beaverton  OR,21,94,27,5/8/2011,1.0,The food- was great. But every time I've tried to visit  at varying times of the day the service was HORRIFIC. Slow  orders were inaccurate  and drinks were difficult to order from the bar.I love Bj's and have never had such consistently bad experiences at another restaurant. However after such slow and inaccurate service I won't be returning to the Arden Mall location.
Patrick M.,Sacramento  CA,5,2,,2/26/2012,5.0,Cambria was the BEST Server EVER!!!She gets 50 Stars!!!!!
Shelley H.,Tujunga  CA,65,40,23,4/3/2015,5.0,So far it's ben about 4 mins the actress was busy but nice. I guess that happens when the hostess tells you that the bar is open. Ordered a soda came right up. Checked back in on me like a min or two later. I decided to get the chicken buffalo pizza. It was spicier than usual due to more of hot sauce on top. However I love hot sauce so it didn't bother me. Then I ordered a mini pizookie (not sure on the spelling) anyway a runner gave me the food and it was a regular size  it was a mistake  and after talking to the server they gave it to me but charged the mini size. All through my waitress was super attentive. When I got the bill I noticed that she did charge right but what was awesome was that she save me money instead of paying $10.00 for a mini buffalo pizza she charged a build your own pizza with unlimited toppings which was $6.00. So instead I gave her a really nice tip overall this is one of the better bj's. If I have the chance to go to sacramento again. I will most likely be stopping by.
Ryan F.,West Sacramento  CA,101,222,19,10/30/2011,3.0,"Eh  you know it\'s not bad. Great prices for lunch  you can get a mini pan pizza and a soup or salad for under $10.00.The pizza here is the primary draw. I\'ve never much cared for any of the rest of their food. They have their own version of deep dish pizza which has a very thick and delicious crust and is served to you in a deep skillet.The best dessert is also served in a skillet  the ""pazookie"" which is basically just an enormous fresh-baked cookie served in a skillet with a scoop of ice cream. In the world of chain dining in the Arden area I\'d rank it after the Cheesecake Factory or Taro\'s but before your other options."
Chris C.,Sacramento  CA,25,4,2,12/6/2014,1.0,1st off let me say that I am a big fan of bjs. However  our first experience at this arden location we expirenced not only bad  but escalated into horrible customer service not only from our waitress (Devanie) but from the manager(Al) as well. To start  the waitress forgot my friend's drink  forgot my bread bowl after all the food came out and we had to ask where it it was after our friends were halfway done eating their main entrees. Also didn't refill our waters  had to ask even though all the empty glasses were at the end of the table after she passed countless times. & on top of speaking to the Manager  the manager told us he wanted us to tell us what should happen. I work in customer service and my friend is a manager  the manager could've been truthful and at least asked what can WE do to make it better not say it's up to you what you want to happen. Not even at least offer a bread bowl and apologize for this experience. The way he spoke made us feel as if we were trying to get something free when all we got from him was a half apology/explanation with a full priced bill until we seriously asked for an accomodation. Also waitress came back with our bill and did not apologize at all. Worst experience ever  point blank. Definitely sticking to the BJ'S in EG. 0 stars !!!!!
Marie L.,Carmichael  CA,0,6,,6/9/2014,5.0,Wow this place is delicious! I've never had such a great burger! I've eaten at the one in Roseville and it doesn't compare! Great food and very friendly!
Ricky N.,Sacramento  CA,479,351,92,5/27/2011,4.0,Definitely on another level than other BJ's I've been to (for example Natomas and Elk Grove)The interior is just off the freakin charts!!! Reminds me of a Las Vegas fine dining restaurant. I couldn't stop gazing at the ceiling for some reason hahaThe food menu is pretty much the same as the others in the chain... but the drink menu is EXTENDED!!! They have over 50 beers on tap and some specialty drinks too. We tried the Lindelman Frambois which was super fruity and sweet  a good drink for girls. Haha not for guys  reminded me of berry cider but with more of a pomegranate juice taste.
Zak F.,Carmichael  CA,85,29,1,12/22/2011,3.0,"Average family dining  in sub par mall. Staff is hit and miss. This latest time service was pretty poor.Avocado eggrolls are the saving grace of bj\'s. Other than that its meh. Beer selection is on point as it should be for a ""brewhouse"".Bottom line: Make the best outta the worst  grab a beer before the mall experience."
Lindsay B.,Sacramento  CA,119,128,2,3/18/2011,4.0,"Even though I don\'t usually make a point to review chain restaurants  I thought I should review the new BJs opening at Arden Fair Mall. I had the chance to dine there last night (for free  by invitation) while the restaurant did a week of ""practice"" so the staff could get everything ready for the grand opening. BJs is alright in my book to begin with  but give it to me for free and I\'ll for sure be there!The location (where California Cafe used to be) is better suited for a BJs than for a more upscale/pricey place  so I think business will do well here. It looks like any other BJs you\'ve probably seen...big  nice  typical etc. There is an interior wall with windows shared by the mall that looks into a walkway by Juicy Couture  so you can people watch as you dine if that suits you! (Keep in mind that the mall patrons can see you as well  so be subtle with your staring).The food and beer was the usual BJs fare and the service was friendly but noticeably new and a bit unsure of the flow of things. I\'m sure the kinks will all get worked out in due time and I think this is a good addition to the Arden plaza."
Angela G.,Hercules  CA,36,68,81,3/8/2012,5.0,Came here last night for the first time (at this location) with my boyfriend for happy hour. Our server was SO nice! I totally forgot what her name was but she was so sweet and kept checking up on us making sure everything was okay. My boyfriend ordered their beer sampler which was definitely worth $12 or however much it was. We actually ordered buffalo wings that our server forgot about so she talked to her manager and they actually took it off our bill and didn't charge us! I wrote a bad review for the BJ's in Concord because they have bad customer service so next time I'm in Sac and craving a Beignet and Mojito I will def be coming back to this BJ's!
Ernest John E.C. C.,Torrance  CA,141,26,,3/24/2014,5.0,The Food And Service is AWESOME!!! Rebecca is EXCELLENT!!! I Wish I can give her more than 5 stars. I would give her a MILLION STARS!!! The Service is Good and Rebecca is VERY NICE!!! I Love The Deep Dish Pizzas  The Handcrafted Root Beer  and The Pizzookie!!! It was Exquisite!!! I will return to This BJ's Soon. I will be there for MY LATE 39TH AND EASTER BASH ON EASTER EVE Saturday  April 19  2014 @ 7:35pm with My Family and Classmates From Hogan High School!!! Hope to see you guys then!!! :)
Anne L.,Sacramento  CA,4,7,,8/29/2014,1.0,"Last night I had dinner at this BJ\'s. I will not be back. Period. The service is lackluster  the food is mediocre  and the bar drinks are pitiful. I am not a big drinker  but when I do indulge I expect a full ~ yep full glass of whatever I\'m drinking. I typically order a Lemon Drop  after my last experience at BJ\'s (several months ago) I don\'t really know why I tried again  but I did. Ugh. The Lemon drop was served 3/4 full and warm ~ yuck! Drinks are not cheap you know  is it too much to ask for a FULL glass?!? I\'m done with this BJ\'s. I\'ll be having my meals at Season\'s 52  which is a lovely restaurant  that serves ice cold and perfect cocktails; not to mention how wonderful their appetizers and desserts are. BJ\'s manager(s) your restaurant is right next door to Season\'s 52  that restaurant was packed last evening  perhaps you should think on this a bit. Analyze why you had to ""close down 1/2 your restaurant because you were so slow""  (direct quote from host you seated us) when the restaurant right next door to you was booming. Wish I had been there."
Alana K.,Marina  CA,45,26,3,2/26/2014,5.0,We've gone to plenty of Bj's but I must say this is the greatest location we've ever been to! We ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps and weren't huge fans of it so we let our server know and the manager Al came over to ask why we didn't like them. He said he'd gladly take it off the bill. Awesome customer service! Never have I been to a restaurant where the manager politely introduced himself to ask us out feedback! Next time I'm in town I will be back!!
Charlene M.,Sacramento  CA,77,10,,3/30/2011,3.0,I was really excited about this restaurant opening at the mall  since it would give anothe option for me and my friends to go to for dinner and bj's food tastes incredible for a chain restaurant.My mom and I opted to sit in the bar because there was a long wait. Their bar is a good size and is open seating so that's convenient. My mom had the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich (yummy) and I had the fettucini alfredo (it was ok). My fav part was the rootbeer! I like how they serve it in a chilled glass and I would definitely come back for the rootbeer alone.The service was decent  it kinda sucked how the server asked us while we were not even halfway through with our food and clearly still eating ( like my fork was still in my hand) if we needed boxes and dropped off our check. Let's face it  when servers do that  it makes the diners feel rushed.The main reason this place only got 3 stars from me is because of their air vents. It was FREEZING in the restaurant but I could manage with me coat on. What sucked was the air vents directly above our table that blew hard wind at my food that my pasta was instantly cold. I would have asked to be seated elsewhere but there were air vents everywhere!All in all  the place was decent and I will probably go back...with my winter coat of course.
Ricky K.,Sacramento  CA,24,37,,7/10/2011,3.0,This is my first time coming here to Bj's  and i gotta say that its ok to me. I wasn't that bad but the service took a while to come. I ordered the Grilled chicken pasta. the pasta was cheesy and the grilled chicken was perfectly cooked. This place reminds me of the cheesecake factory lol.
Brad L.,Vallejo  CA,58,118,4,3/14/2012,3.0,BJ's is one of the few chains that I think has somewhat decent food. They are very popular so there is almost always a wait. Their pizzas are decent and everyone always loves their desserts. It is amazing how many types of pizza cookies they have come up with.Their beer is drinkable. Nothing special and I do not think it will any awards anytime soon. I am not a huge fan at drinking at BJ's in general. Their mixed drinks are tasty but weak and expensive. As I said before the beer is nothing special. This is a place to go with your family for lunch but not with your friends when you want a night out.
Lily F.,Santa Cruz  CA,45,70,62,3/1/2012,4.0,I've been here a few times and I've always been satisfied with the food and service (3 stars). The last time I was at BJ's we stopped by for drinks and I must say that the bartender was awesome (Shout out to PAUL!). He was the only guy behind the bar and he did a great job helping everyone sitting at the bar and the drinks he made were awesome. So  with all that being said I'm bumping up my review to 4 STARS.
Amy Q.,Reno  NV,703,205,116,12/22/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,BJ's Favorite Pizza with a side of Ranch and thats all I could really eat here. I wish service was a bit more on point  but the servers tend to always switch halfway between my meals every time I go here. The food is served slightly warm to cold and when I pay extra for a wedge salad  the iceberg wasn't dry completely and had a pool of water mixed with my bleu cheese  it wasn't good. I like this location a lot  its modernized but cramped. I feel like I can hear everyone's conversations at once and the servers tend to not check up on the table.
Frank C.,Sacramento  CA,7,26,,5/2/2013,1.0,"I dreaded even coming back to this establishment after the first encounter of having a terrible pizza with lack of toppings or none and then the full drink tray spilled on our table and that ran all over my shoes and they only thing the waitress cared about was the next table to make sure they did not have anything on them. And having a bus boy spend half of our meal wiping up the table and booth and floor while we TRIED to eat  and at no point did he say a word. Oh but my g/f spoke with a manager and showed them what type of pizza we have had and had to gaul to ask if we was just eating the toppings off the pizza.. But I was outside because I was really trying not to lose my cool. But she got a whoopie $25 gift card after a 50+ bill.So anyways after the previous experience my g/f said Of we should go there and try the Burgers. I was going oh great have to wear my rain boats if going back there again(lol). So on to ordering She wanted a burger (called Black and Bleu) I ordered the Calzone in which tasted like a dry hot pocket made in a microwave. My g/f burger smelled burnt from the time it was on the table. My mistake is i didnt ask her how was it but after her lathering it in ketchup i knew something was wrong. She said it was dry and no BLEU cheese on it and one little tomato paper thin I might add. I asked how was it ordered and she said said med-well. WELL it was WELL done alright and it took me awhile to get the chard taste out of my mouth for the one bite I had of the burger. I asked the waitress that was changed mid way of us eating I asked what was written on the original order for the burger because this is way over done and she said ""sorry""walked away and then 8 mins later said it was med-well and asked her to look at it and does this look med-well to you? She replied no not really well DUH. So we just laid the gift card for the check that took forever to come and well the gift card is 25 and this 5 should cover the rest of it and I am not waiting for change and walked away with another bad taste in my mouth in more ways then one.Final Conclusion- How in the hell does have any customer retention here? Beer  drinks Or just a place to hang out and meet up at? I have no no idea but if your looking for a decent meal the food court upstairs is better then this place."
David S.,Sacramento  CA,24,12,,3/27/2015,3.0,The craft beers - not bad but not great. A little too chain-restaurant tasting. The food isn't bad; my burger was cooked to order and fairly tasty. The dessert was excellent - the pizookie dessert is to die for! Atmosphere - meh. It's really loud and busy  and impossible to talk to your date. Overall I give it 3 stars.
Robert P.,Roseville  CA,122,49,13,6/19/2013,4.0,Just visited for the first time to this location and it was just as great as my previous experiences with other locations. Delicious food and the pazookies are amazing.
Andrew P.,Sacramento  CA,91,20,4,1/4/2014,4.0,I ordered the new bj burger and wow  the meat was soo juicy  I wished I had more. The thin cut fries are also delicious. Although the service is sometimes slow  the food always makes it up. Will come here again whenever any special occasions come up.
noc f.,Sacramento  CA,170,205,833,5/14/2011,4.0,Choices Choices Choices....I like choices!!!They have a lot of selection- Have ya seen their menu?!!??!!I like this place eventhough it gets too loud sometimes...heheheheNot crazy about the new Red Velvet Pizzookie though. Waaay too sweet for my sweet tooth. Other than that  It's a great place to go to after work and chill.
Dave G.,Capitola  CA,29,52,,7/20/2011,2.0,For a restaurant in the Arden Fair Mall  I suppose it's not all that bad. I wanted to visit because I had read some reviews on Chicago Fire's page saying that BJs deep dish pizza was so much better. Well  I'm certainly not an authority on deep dish pies  but I know what I like  and BJs work really pales in comparison to other deep dish pizzas in town.We've been twice so far  the service was absolutely lousy the first time (lunch rush) and I felt the food was overpriced for what we received. The second time we came for dinner and while the service was much improved  I still left disappointed in the meal.They do have great beer  and it's a nice place to throw one back with a buddy and watch the highlights  but I probably won't be back anytime soon.
PK A.,River Park  Sacramento  CA,0,9,1,8/14/2013,1.0,"My husband ordered the bleu cheeseburger. I took one bite and was horrified to find a hard piece of bone. I understand that this was due to the butchering of the meat. However  when we told out server  she simply said  ""Thanks."" We then asked to speak to a manager  waited 10 minutes and they never showed. The lack of respect at this establishment for the customer disgusted me. We will never be going back. If you have crowns or fillings  please BEWARE!"
Matty K.,Sacramento  CA,150,383,10,11/18/2011,3.0,"We came here on the opening night of a movie and decided to have a drink and a dessert while we waited. I walked into a restaurant and stood at the empty hostess stand. Within a minute or so the hostess greets me and tells me about the late night happy hour  and that the bar area has full service and open seating.This is the part where our experience went from 5 stars to three. I stood at the bar area looking for a seat. The only two booths open were dirty  so I waited there for someone to bus it. 5 minutes later of standing there awkwardly with servers walking by completely avoiding eye contact with me and ignoring me I finally chose a table all the way in the back. 10 minutes later my server greets me. I\'m sorry  but I saw her walk by at least 5 times while I sat there  couldn\'t she had just paused for 2 seconds and say ""I\'ll be right with you?"" It also wasn\'t that busy.The service was friendly and good  the drinks were delicious and the strawberry baked beignet was sooo good! I felt bad being irritated at the beginning because she was actually very nice. A beignet coated with cinnamon sugar topped with vanilla ice cream with strawberry sauce over it and covered in whipped cream. My pancreas was sent into overdrive after that little concoction. Overall: Good service  tasty food  yummy drinks. But it would be nice if anyone just told me they would be right with me."
W. N.,Orange County  CA,34,281,4,11/16/2013,4.0,I can ALWAYS rely on BJ's whether I am in San DIego  Huntington Beach or Sacramento. Great happy hour  seasonl beers and oh yes! That pizza. OLd reliable no matter where I go!
Alice Z.,San Francisco  CA,215,254,52,11/29/2011,3.0,"My second time at BJs. I\'ve went to Elephant Bar and Gordon Biersch before so I thought they were very similar.I couldn\'t make up my mind between pasta or burger. It was a very difficult decision to make lol. My boyfriend just came from the mall and we wanted to grab a fancy type lunch. He wanted pasta; so I told him to get the Cajun pasta since i know he likes spicy!I finally settled on the California burger on a whole wheat bun and wedge fries with ranch. The burger was tasty  nothing special though. My boyfriend didn\'t like his pasta because he wanted the ""white sauce"" meaning alfredo sauce. The cajun pasta wasn\'t even spicy!! i thought it was going to be spicy! Disappointed.We had to get the pazookie pizookie however you spell it! My bf never had it so I had to pop his cherry lol. We decided on the red velvet! I never had to so I thought it would be yummy and i was correct! We devoured it in under 10mins it was soooo good!!! That was probably the best part of our entire meal! And the bill came out to be $36. I thought it was pricey  maybe because my dumbass bf just had to get a $5 beer...oh well. Next time we\'re coming to happy hour!"
Dale W.,Stockton  CA,41,71,4,11/21/2013,4.0,It was great to grab my own table at the bar  bypassing the line for tables otherwise  sample a couple beers  and order quickly. Good experience and service.
A B.,Carmichael  CA,5,81,32,3/24/2012,4.0,I generally have good food and service at BJ's.Today was my first visit to this location. It was 2 for lunch and we were seated immediately. Our service was very good and we were checked on frequently. We had the fried artichoke hearts first  which were fantastic  and under $4. We each had a sandwich - I had the turkey cobb. Love it. Very good. Did not get the pazookie this time but it's to die for.
Laszlo M.,Sacramento  CA,85,32,74,12/4/2013,3.0,Your standard chain. fair quality. nice menu. Good drinks. needs work on listening to customers instead of ushering them into the bar area. Long wait for table but it was a busy night!
Martino P.,San Francisco  CA,40,10,,2/18/2015,3.0,Very nice and professional staff  and the service is good. The food is decent. It's not bad by any means. The one issue I have here is the portions are irritatingly small  to the point where I won't be back. I'm sorry but for a place that serves more of an average Joe/blue collar clientele  I like a decent portion size. I find it irritating when a place like BJs tries to market itself as a high end place with minute portion sizes. This isn't a four star restaurant...it is on the same level as a Hard Rock Cafe  so let's up the portion size please.
Jennifer H.,Sacramento  CA,12,1,,2/16/2014,2.0,Had to wait for our food for 35 minutes and then it came out wrong. We asked to speak to the manager and after 10 minutes he came to talk to us and offered other food but at this point were past waiting for anything else. He comped our food and was really nice. Sorry that the kitchen was off their game.
Christina D.,Citrus Heights  CA,6,80,,1/12/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,The server was slow and he messed up more than one item in order. He did not care about how he inconvenienced us. The Manager took care of issues and gave us a new server but the mood/ experience was ruined. We were later to an event we were attending afterwards because of how much time we spent waiting to order and get our order corrected.
J L.,Sacramento  CA,62,62,28,9/20/2012,2.0,I never like coming here. My husband their ribs and pizza. I order a chicken lettuce wrap..boy  I tell that dish was the most salty dish I EVER had in my life. Nothing is good here everybody here looks stuck up. If ya don't like your job then quit. We are your boss we paid your bills.
Mike D.,Sacramento  CA,102,172,71,5/25/2011,5.0,Yeayer!!!Go on game night.And get the roast beef.The party will commence in your mouth.**Yelpers be forewarned: Wear sweats or be ready to unbuckle because the food is soooo good and the portions so big  you'll need the extra room!**
Kelsey M.,Portland  OR,3,20,,9/24/2012,2.0,"Wellllllll  this was my first BJs experience. Went with roommates to celebrate a 21st birthday. Overall unimpressed with all aspects of this restaurant. I wouldn\'t call it bad...but more so ""mediocre."" Overpriced entrees  overpriced drinks  un-enthused server (who never offered us condiments for our french fries!). I would gladly pay $10 each for a drink and burger if they were high quality  but they were far from. Burger tasted bland and drink was just the typical pre-made juice and booze. I would maybe go again if I\'m not paying for it. However  can\'t see myself ever deciding to go here on my own will."
Rachel E.,Fair Oaks  CA,96,49,28,9/11/2013,1.0,Wonder why we coming back. The ONLY good part about this place is beer and the bartenders. Other than that. Food is mediocre  certain hostess staff is rude  service can be good or bad and if you read one of my tips you will understand the rest. For now.
Connie B.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,7/24/2014,1.0,We go out for lunch every day and BJ's has to be the worst one we have been to. I placed an order to go and was told 15 minutes. When I arrived  I was told an additional 10 minutes. It wasn't even started yet. It took 40 minutes to get a to go order. And the excuse they always give is that they're busy...have you looked around? It's never that busy and for a place that calls itself a lunch and dinner place  they don't know what they're doing. They never  never try to make it good  the manager just stares at you and apologizes. Never  never will I go there again. Minimum wage should not mean minimum service  they are just dreadful. And when is being busy a bad thing?
Nelle A.,Sacramento  CA,23,39,19,4/5/2013,1.0,Bad service at this location. Took 25 minutes to take my order on a not so busy night (Wednesday)
Shawn B.,Antelope  CA,20,202,38,10/5/2011,3.0,The food is good  the staff was decent. They tried to fit a whole lot restaurant into a little space so it was a bit crowded. Over all  not bad.
Anna K.,Sacramento  CA,2,14,12,5/2/2013,5.0,I've had BJ's more than 5 times now  and I will definitely go there again. Love it everytime!!
Blake C.,CA  CA,236,282,64,7/11/2011,4.0,It's so great that this place is at the mall now. Good food  good ambiance  good service. Not bad for a chain restaurant! And even better that it is now in the Arden mall so you can do some shopping and eat.
Lauren M.,Washington  UT,91,33,4,3/21/2013,2.0,Food is ok. Very poor customer service.
Eirika H.,Los Angeles  CA,332,247,26,7/13/2011,4.0,YUM.Love the spinach mushroom appetizer  the caesar salad  their crispy friend chicken  and their pazookie! (and just about everything I've tasted on the menu was delicious)The service is pretty great  and the atmosphere is classy and quiet. Parking is decent to find (except on the weekends) and it's definitely a great way to relax after an intense session of shopping!The price rivals that of the cheesecake factory (which I like more) but this place is a great place to come when the wait for the cheesecake factory is 0.5-1.5hrs!
Tiffany K.,Sacramento  CA,1,22,11,11/16/2012,1.0,I feel bad for giving such a normally good place a bad review but I want this to be seen. I had my boyfriend and his good friend visiting California (1 from TN one from GA) both captains in the army. We went to BJ's on Veterans day. I was waiting to see if the waiter would say anything at all about anything special for Veterans days and he he didn't. I decided to go up and sneak out to talk to the ladies near the entry way and they were like oh yes we offer a special on meals and rattled of their specials. I said oh  I am sorry we already placed our orders and our waiter didn't even say anything about that so we didn't even know going into placing them. So I asked if they could do something special for them like bring them a small pizookie and the girl was very nice and said oh of course! At the end of the meal  our waiter said do you two want dessert? Pizookies? They are free??? The guys looked shocked  free? Ok that would be great! The waiter walked away and again they were wondering why they were free? I had to explain because our waiter was an idiot obviously and said oh it's to say thank you for your service! Sorry to be so harsh. But how hard is it to say  gosh thank you two so much for serving our country after you specifically know that these are two men in the army. They sacrifice their lives for us and the dude couldn't even say a measly few words. Not saying they had to offer anything and to be honest I wasn't sure if they would be doing anything but just thought it would be nice to find out. But in finding out our waiter didn't even bring that up when they had the opportunity is was what really got me. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. HAVE RESPECT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY. IT TAKES TWO SECONDS TO SAY THANK YOU. And I finally got that off my chest. Thank you YELP! :)
Milena C.,Hillsboro  OR,3,101,7,6/25/2011,3.0,Came here originally because of a cousin's wife's bday. Pizza was sublime (Sweet Pig) as well as the beer (Jeremiah Red). Man  Jeremiah Red is so damn good  I've been back a few times purely for that beer. Beer that gives a buzz but isn't god awful. What! It exists!Been back a few times. Service has sucked once or twice  but has been better overall. Salad/Flatbread Pizza combo is awesome and the drinks are strong. Something about this place prevents me from being too much of a regular  but still an enjoyable treat.
Kimberly O.,Carmichael  CA,3,35,86,8/9/2013,5.0,Went with my mother and ordered the black and blue burger. OMG it is delish. The potato wedges were fresh and wonderful. I will go back for sure. MMMMM
Michelle H.,Tucson  AZ,155,30,,10/21/2012,2.0,"In terms of food  a BJ\'s is a BJ\'s is a BJ\'s. In terms of food quality  BJ\'s gives at least a solid three stars. What makes or breaks a chain such as BJ\'s is the experience you get at the location. And for me  my experience was none too pleasing.Hostess - keep doin\' what you\'re doin\'. Welcoming smile  pretty face - I\'m sure it brings people through the door just fine.Server - You need to work on.... just about everything.I was in the area for an interview close by and decided to stop by Arden Fair afterwards for the hell of it. Luckily  my boyfriend and I came in at around Happy Hour. We\'ve never done Happy Hour at BJ\'s before  but HH anywhere means pretty sweet deals. We asked for one small specialty pizza and asked if we could get an order of a mini-Pizookie. We didn\'t order any drinks aside from water; quite frankly  we knew ordering that was more than enough to make us full.1. Server got our order wrong. We were given 2 pizzas instead. We shrugged it off and let it slide. It\'s fine. Still enough of a calorie bomb to ward off hunger on our stomachs. Bonus for us was that at least the pizzas were on HH prices.2. Nearing the end of our meal  our server was never to be found. After even flagging down other servers  they were later nowhere to be found. When our server or another server did come by  there was no genuine feeling of service to be found in their expressions. YES  YES  I GET IT. WE DIDN\'T PIG OUT AND DISH OUT MAJOR CASH. But A) HELLOOOOO  IT\'S HAPPY HOUR!  and B) Don\'t you want to provide good service to make us WANT to come back and order more the next time?Paying with the server was a pain in the ass. Simply asking for the bill took about 10 minutes. Once the bill came  we slid a credit card in within seconds and had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to have them pick it up. How long did it take us to get our credit card back? Another 10 minutes. I understand if we weren\'t ideal customers in terms of getting much money from us  but besides the quantity of what we\'d ordered  we never acted out or did anything outlandish throughout our meal. We were polite and gave respect to every employee  despite the worsening ""respect"" we got in return from the workers. To spend 30 minutes of our time just to go through the paying process is not what I call good service.And for the record  the place was pretty EMPTY. It was around 3-4 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. It\'s been months since this incident  and I never returned to this BJ\'s since  nor will I ever return again. From now on  one should be asking  ""How would you rank your service this evening  on a scale of BJ\'s - 10?"""
Christine B.,Sacramento  CA,3,24,,4/6/2011,4.0,"Service so good  I had to Yelp about it! Well  not quite but lemme splain........I am not a big weekday lunch eater but today I was SUPER hungry. I really like BJ\'s BBQ Chicken Salad and remembered they do a smaller lunch portion so I was totally AT THAT!!! I came in around 1:30pm and was quickly seated- that\'s ALWAYS a plus. Ordered my salad and a yummy beverage that I won\'t mention since it is a work day ;-) 15 minutes later I get my water!!!!! WTH?? I did not complain but I did ask my waitress for the check about 5 minutes later when my drink finally showed up. She apologized for the delay in the drink arrival and I explained that the drink wasn\'t such a big deal (I could gulp that down) but what was up with the salad?? IT\'S A SALAD!!!!! No cooking involved. Within moments the manager was at my table. I didn\'t ask for a manager. I didn\'t even complain. He told me that my first drink was not mixed to his standards and that he had them re-do it. He then apologized and told me that my salad would be taken care of. Free salad and a yummy manager approved drink- I will be retuning for sure! Hopefully the ""newness"" doesn\'t go away too quickly. Whew! That was my longest Yelp yet! =)"
Lyndsy B.,Sacramento  CA,0,6,,1/22/2014,4.0,Food is decent  beer is decent. Good selection of beer. The biggest drawback is that it is ALWAYS crowded.
Nhu-Quynh N.,Sacramento  CA,359,297,65,8/26/2012,3.0,Every time I come here  I always get my meals replaced because something was wrong. Medium rare that comes out cooked. Or Jambalaya that is over peppered. If I had to say the only thing I'd give props for is the fact that the service is excellent. They always compliment the meal if they had something wrong and had to replace. But their chef's seriously need to get a reality check on how to properly cook something and not just base it on what they feel like it should taste like. Cause if that was the case they shouldn't ask how I like the meat on my burger. I'm just saying.
Hannah Z.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,,2/1/2013,1.0,Barely rates one star. Basically a Denny's with beer. The food is bland (white lettuce salad) and pre-made. The service was good (thus  the star). Save your money and go to a locally owned brew pub.
Christina K.,Tomball  TX,17,27,30,8/20/2013,2.0,Alright  so I've been to this BJ's a few times and have always been a fan  love the one in Houston  TX and went to the one in Natomas  always good food and service.BUT  tonight  we went to BJ's it's a Weds night and the restaurant wasn't super busy... waited 20 mins for a table for 3... wondering why there was a wait since we could see open tables  plus 3 groups of 2 were seated before us. Matthew was our waiter  he wasn't a very good waiter at that either  which reflected in his tip. I'm pretty sure that atleast 2 people sitting around us sent their fo
Pam H.,Redwood City  CA,221,162,63,7/17/2011,4.0,"We are hear in Sacramento for the weekend and needed a place for dinner tonight- we wanted something close to the dance venue that we were planning on going to and BJ\'s seemed to be about 5 minutes away. We found parking pretty quickly  it is located in a mall  so lots of shared parking. We were greeted by the hostess  she was very friendly and told us we\'d have a 5 minute wait for our table. That was pretty accurate and we were then seated.  Our waitress was friendly and greeted us right away  our glasses of water came pretty quickly  the cocktails took a bit longer. We placed our food order and it came pretty quickly- but she only came by once after that to check in on us. We could have used another check-in so that my husband could order a refill on his drink.  We did eventually get the drink ordered after asking the hostess to send our server over.Food was good..i had the Bacon Cheeseburger and my husband has the Talapia off the ""enlightened menu""- both were very good. We didn\'t bother with appetizers or desserts.Overall  I am a fan of BJ\'s- our service was a little lacking at this one  but it wouldn\'t keep me from coming back or trying another location."
Lindsey C.,Sacramento  CA,242,67,6,8/16/2013,3.0,I love the food at BJ's but this location took us 3 hours to get in and out of. Horrible turn over rate. The food was the saving grace though. I just won't be returning to this location.
Brandy H.,Carmichael  CA,49,309,34,6/4/2011,4.0,I love BJ's. They have an amazing selection of beer. I have not come across any food I have not liked. At our table all the food was great; California cheeseburger  turkey burger  pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos  chicken pesto flat bread  and Cajun pasta. Every one loved there food. The best part was the pazookies. We got the trio with chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream  cookies and cream  and triple chocolate. The only complaint. They service was horribly slow. It took forever to get our food. I have only experienced that at this location.
maria g.,Davis  CA,30,97,10,4/4/2011,3.0,Went here with my friend for her birthday. The size of the place is okay  but I don't think there is too much room between the aisles. I've been to other BJ's restaurants with better layouts. The food was standard  and nothing special. The pizookie  on the other hand  was godly. OMG *homer simpson drool*. I'm so happy to learn that they introduced a mini trio of pizookies to share. The minis are perfectly sized. I always seem to get crazy sick after eating the larger ones lol. The wait was pretty long. Maybe it's due to it being relatively new.
Johnathen D.,Davis  CA,248,16,,6/28/2011,3.0,Ok  so I went with some work people the other day and I was feeling like soup so I got the chili (which was a bit of a let down  but good. I just didn't expect what I got). The best part was the potato topped with chicken and other acoutrements. Awesome. Epic. It was massive and delicious and  because my tiny bird belly couldn't finish it and I had to take a doggy bag  it was still awesome like a week later out of my microwave. Totally a fan. All I'm gonna want from here for a while is giant  yummy  potatoes and beers. Count me in.Update: Went today (7/20/11)  and the food was awesome of course. I had the exact same meal. Loved it. Only problem I had was the waiter was kind of rude. A man. I was there with 8 women. They all got their water's filled twice before I got me tea filled once. Rude. My friend tried to explain that it was just easier to serve water  and that sometimes they wait till you're almost done to serve tea so it's not wasted  but I don't buy it. lol. I think I was being ignored in favor of all the lovely ladies. I'm not too mad  cause I get the logic  I just love my damn tea. The waitress I had on my first visit wasn't like that with me. Holla.
nate j.,Sacramento  CA,30,51,,4/22/2011,4.0,real talk...I've worked for this company before... i was a trainer a Finished Beer Specialist (yes that's a job) this location has to be small on Bj's standards  but the bar and cocktail staff are great and I will go back.
Carizma D.,Sacramento  CA,13,90,3,4/11/2013,4.0,Had a blast this past Sunday with my roommate at BJ's. We went right before 10pm. (Happy Hour starts @10pm) We had mini pizzas (I had buffalo chicken & she had BBQ Chicken) Both were satisfying. The service was good. Shout out to Robert in the bar area for being very accommodating.
Jason C.,Carmichael  CA,14,78,1,6/6/2013,4.0,I've been here twice now: once for lunch and once for happy hour. They have a great atmosphere inside the restaurant. Beer selection is pretty decent  but they definitely seem to steer you towards their house brews - which are quite good. Lunch was delicious and the portions were fine (even the small portion lunch was quite ample). For happy hour we had drinks  appetizers and desserts. The appetizers (we got the best beginnings platter) and the dessert (the pizookie party platter) were fantastic. Drinks  however  were all over the map. Beers were good  but the two mixed drinks my sister ordered were terrible (we all decided we had to taste them). In their defense  our waitress was very accommodating and service was great. I guess the lesson here is don't go to a brewhouse for mixed drinks!
Colette P.,Novato  CA,113,44,12,2/11/2013,4.0,Food is great  good selection. However the service is hit or miss. Sometimes I have a great wait-person and other times I am left wondering how that staff member was hired.
Billy A.,Sacramento  CA,30,141,205,5/13/2013,4.0,Good prices with large portions. I love the watermelon feta salad and the stuffed mushrooms. Both under $10 there Mac n cheese is absolutely mouthwatering. They stay busy but always have friendly and fast service. Open late so it's a great place to go and grab a bite to eat when ur hungry late night.
Ashton C.,Fresno  CA,2,78,,4/3/2015,1.0,"Awful attitudes. My friend and I came here at 10pm for dinner  we drove from Santa Clara and we aren\'t familiar with the area. We arrive & the hostess just stares at us. No hello  no smile. My friend and I asked for a table & she told us that it was happy hour at the bar & it\'s probably easier if we just go seat ourselves. We looked at the bar & it was completely packed. We told the hostess that there wasn\'t 2 seats for us to sit & she said we could probably ask someone to scoot over. Uh  no? We asked again for a table & she was like ""well...*eye roll* okay hold on."" Looks at this paper  assumingly  for open tables and then says ""k. Wait"". I looked at my friend & even she said that this hostess didn\'t want to seat us. I checked outside the door to see what time it closed just to make sure we weren\'t coming in like five or ten minutes before they closed  then I would understand because that is annoying. We showed up two hours before they closed at midnight. She grabs the menu\'s and says ""k this way."" Drops our menu\'s off and then just walks away. Our server took about 20 minutes to greet us but overall he was okay. I later overheard another female waitress yell ""Kevin!"" to one other server. She was at the register punching it something and my friend & I could hear her loud voice cussing away  bitching about how the hostess was double seating her. Being in restaurant business before  I could see why that would be overwhelming but this was a Thursday night  it was not crowded at all. I definitely think she could handle the few tables she had. She was dropping F bombs like no other (not that I care but in a professional setting  as loud as she was  was very inappropriate). The servers and hostess really need to act more professionally and straighten up their attitudes because they\'re not doing a good job hiding it and clearly they don\'t care."
Anibal H.,Sacramento  CA,6,6,,8/6/2011,3.0,Definitely a good place to stop and have a nice lunch or happy hour deal. The menu has so much variety that you are bound to find something to like. My 13-yr-old daughter and I simply had appetizers in the middle of the PM  and I have to say that the attention to detail and fresh ingredients was noticeable. And so inexpensive! I agree with another reviewer who called out those who hate chain restaurants to get off their high horse.  The service was good and friendly. We went to the one on Laguna Blvd (Elk Grove)  which on weekend nights is always packed  with families/ strollers in tow and long waiting lines. Therefore the sound level can be a bit too much. BJ's is a welcome addition to the Arden Fair Mall. Let's only hope that it takes a while for the location in Arden to get to that level. In the meantime  enjoy and be surprised!!
Jessica P.,Lincoln  CA,4,53,52,2/19/2013,5.0,Went out for my Birthday last night  we had a party of 10 and we were served by Diego # 226. He was GREAT !! He had everything on point. Worth the price for the quality of food. I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch deep dish pizza   it was good but i definelty will stick to my Barbeque Chicken the flavor is great.
Randy M.,Sacramento  CA,0,73,2,7/23/2014,3.0,We had a great visit. Did the happy hour before the fair. Food was as expected for HH. 6$ pizza was nice portion but lacked sauce. Thought it was really dry. Dough was excellent. So were the toppings. The 4$ boneless wings were good too. Thought portion was a little small  but tasty. Avocado egg rolls were good but would like more crunch inside. I would order all again. Just add more sauce to the pizza. Overall  average to above for food quality during happy hour. Pretty good drafts as well. I've always liked their beer. Went with IPA. Well balanced and easy to drink. We got the last bar table and our service was right on. Our server was attentive and she had great support. Love when teamwork is apparent. This location was good for us  Food wasn't quite four stars but better than most corporate chains for HH. Well try their non-happy hour pizza next time  looks really good. Would recommend.
Bobby R.,Napa  CA,14,13,8,8/25/2014,4.0,The place has Good beer and a really nice atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Ask for Rebecca-she's AWESOME
Vicky Q.,Sacramento  CA,66,153,264,11/7/2012,4.0,I don't really care for BJ's but this Arden location is a bit better. Food tasted a little better but it might have been my perception of this new location. Only thing I like here is their pizza but I had their Thai Chicken salad last time and it was good. Great for late nights  food is okay  drinks are usualy good.
Jim H.,Sacramento  CA,23,133,9,10/29/2012,4.0,"I don\'t Yelp many ""chain"" restaurants but I really like this place. The happy hour is especially welcoming. They have 1$ off their drafts and discounted personal mini size pizzas. We really like their pizza here and we\'re kind of pizza snobs! We had their spicy meat ball with sausage  jalapeo  spicy sauce. We split the mini pizza and added 2 small salads  1 draft and a water. $16+ They have great dinners as well. Especially good is their chicken parmesan. We usually spit that as well because the portion is quite large. Yes  I am a fan."
Ronnie D.,Dixon  CA,13,16,29,9/9/2013,1.0,"Went here for an early dinner with my wife and son after shopping the mall. There were hardly any people. After making it to the hostess desk and waiting for one of the three girls to stop gossiping and actually help us we were greeted with a ""how many?"" Then she turned back around and then we had to wait another minute for the other girl to start walking with our menus ( she realized we weren\'t following her then said ""oh this way."") The waitress had no idea about the pizza deal that had been advertised and charged us 22.95 plus tax when it was supposed to be 19.99. Oh and we had to ask her to get our empty plates and if we could have our dessert at some point because we already had our leftovers boxed up and the waitress still hadn\'t brought it out. unbelievable."
Madison A.,Carmichael  CA,18,28,43,3/14/2012,1.0,Worst service ever. Been to plenty of bjs our server was horrible! Complained and management did nothing! Do not go there!
Cindy M.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,1,6/21/2013,2.0,So I went to BJs for the 1st time a few weeks ago. It took about 45 minutes to get a table (i understand its busy) They have a nice selection of drinks and food. I may have made a mistake i ordered the fried calamari =( it was the worst i have ever had!!!! i should have ordered a Burger or pizza maybe it would have been better. Not to mention the waiter we got was kinda rude. I understand she was busy and maybe under stress but for a bill over 100 that women should have been a little nicer to us! If we decided to go back ill make sure to order something different and hope i don't get that same waiter.
SacTown G.,Elk Grove  CA,0,244,1,6/10/2013,4.0,"We had a great to-go purchase/meal this past Sunday. The woman who helped us was awesome. Boxed/bagged everything up and was super friendly. I am not a BJ\'s ""fan"" but she was awesome and thus I was glad we brought in food for our office. Keep up the good work! Oh ya  and there were several parking places out front  reserved for BJs togo orders  so was no problem parking! Great job!"
Renee S.,Carmichael  CA,21,2,,7/22/2014,3.0,"We go to BJ\'s about once a week for happy hour. Always good food and usually good service. Today however the service left us feeling uncomfortable. While we were deep in conversation and both still drinking wine the server told us that we needed to pay the check now because she had to clock out  ""I literally have two minutes"". An unfortunate end to what was a good experience. It felt like all she wanted was her tip  she didn\'t really care about what our wants or needs were."
Food L.,Sacramento  CA,1,46,,2/23/2013,1.0,"I was pretty hungry after walking around all day and thought to try this place out since it\'s relatively new to the mall. Got some beers  and even though I didn\'t like the first one  I was able to exchange it with no additional charge: 1 star. The time between ordering and receiving the appetizer was a long one hour. Finally the main dish came out--we ordered pizza. First of all  there was absolutely no sauce  very little cheese  very little meat/veggies (which were mostly from a can) on this pizza. Basically  it was all fatty dough. Disgusting. I was so hungry and had no choice but to eat some. I asked to speak to the manager  who then told me that they don\'t use lots of sauce because it makes the dough soggy (umm...... then don\'t use so much dough  duh!). Then she said that the cook simply did not ""disperse"" the ingredients evenly on the pizza (is that a euphemism for being cheap?). She also said we came at the end of the dinner rush time  so that\'s why the wait was long. I wasn\'t really happy with those explanations  and she offered to buy us dessert. I didn\'t want more carbs after that pizza  so I asked if we could get a 20% discount. Instead  we got $5 off our bill. It seems like this place is having a lot of turnover.. one of the other reviews stated that the manager is male. Also  if you\'re the manager of a restaurant  you want to keep customers coming back. Sorry  $5 off isn\'t enough. It seems like they are having this issue pretty often to not foot my bill. Don\'t come here. Poor management and very poor food. $40 down the drain..that\'s like a top right?"
Gayle P.,Winter Park  FL,8,30,,11/4/2011,1.0,I've been to many BJs locations  and this one my friends us the WORST!!!We were seated quickly but it took over 20 minutes before we were greeted. The server made no eye contact. She took our drink and appetizer order. 15 minutes later we got our appetizer  but still no drinks. Helloooo  it's deep- fried  I'm gonna choke.Food came out. THEN drinks came out. Drink order was wrong  and lo and behold  the food order was wrong too. Nearly an hour later  our server decided to check on us and ask if we wanted boxes. I had taken one bite of my dinner and she never even asked if it was ok.Don't even bother trying to explain the problem to management. They just make excuses without offering solutions. Spent nearly $50 for pretty much just an appetizer. So  we ended up going home and cooking for ourselves. Some night out!
Grace W.,Sacramento  CA,27,67,4,5/2/2012,5.0,"Reallly nice!!! I love the inside  its well set! Fancy much! Right when I walked in the hostess... smiled and she was super friendly  right when we sat down she kept lookin and she said ""I\'m sorry you\'re just so pretty"" :) I left a big tip! Hahahaha"
Elizabeth W.,Sacramento  CA,141,25,99,11/28/2012,4.0,Great Customer Service. The Pastas and Pizza's are always fabulously delicious.
Dana C.,Lodi  CA,704,491,855,4/13/2012,4.0,What a great addition to Arden Mall... beers and shopping! It's two of life's greatest pleasures all wrapped into one. Perfect!My friend and I arrived around lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon. Where do all of these people come from? We were surprised at how busy both the mall and BJ's were.Sat in the bar and service was great! Prompt attention and service from the nice bartender. Beers were served in an ice cold glass. Try the Jeremiah Red  it's yummy! Ordered from the light fare menu. The food was lacking in calories but not in taste! Had 3 (very small) barbecoa tacos  which were served with black beans and a small pickled carrot/onion slaw. The meat had good flavor  the beans weren't too salty and I felt satisfied after I ate. Keep in mind  if you're really hungry  the tacos will not be enough!Finished our meal with a Piranha Pale Ale  which has a crisp hoppy finish. Very yummy and worth trying.Overall  great service  good food  reasonably priced.Will I be back? For shopping and beer... YES!
lana Y.,Sacramento  CA,0,11,,9/29/2011,1.0,this particular location is so disorganized and the service here sucks!!! the last time i went here was in april!! i refuse to go to this BJ'S location.i go to the other locations only  this place truely sucks!!! they gave me and my bf food poisoning!!! my brother went there a few weeks later had crappy service  they messed up his whole order. They really need to rehire their whole crew!!!
Cindy A.,Elk Grove  CA,5,11,7,8/29/2011,1.0,This is not the first time that I've been to a BJ's restaurant and not the first location either. Let me just say that I refuse to come back to this particular location! I had received the most terrible customer service ever!!!I met up with a friend for lunch and we got the same thing basically. We ordered from the lunch special menu. I got a half sandwich with house salad and my friend ordered a half sandwich as well with soup. I'm a big fan of this lunch option especially because I'm a person who never finishes a whole sandwich in one sitting unless I'm there for 5 hours lol. First off  our waitress was quite awkward with us but we got seated fairly quick. After we ordered  our food took forever to arrive--around 40+ mins. When we finally received our food  I noticed that my salad did not look the freshest. I picked out a lot of stuff that just looked off. My sandwich was burnt...while my friend's sandwich looked perfectly golden brown. I ripped a corner of the bread to taste...it was inedible. I told the waitress how I needed a new sandwich. Minutes later  a manager or whatever came over to our table and apologized to me about the sandwich  which I thought was great customer service! Boy  was I wrong! I waited about 15 minutes for the new sandwich to come out  IT WAS THE SAME SANDWICH! The manager personally brought it out to me and I told him  but he LIED to me that it's a brand new one.....First of all  do not lie to my face when I know it is the same sandwich with a missing corner that I ate! We were kind of arguing which is just ridiculous. After questioning him for an explanation  he was forced to bring it back. I had to wait again....for like 20 mins for the new one. I was furious... I spent all my time waiting when I was starving!!
Justin T.,Sunnyvale  CA,766,10,1,4/1/2012,1.0,"HORRIBLE! THEE worst Bj\'s I have ever been to. Me and my friends walk in then we wait for a bit... There\'s seating everywhere. Then we get seated. We\'re waiting for the longest time and we\'re not even asked if we want waters. Another group sits down and they\'re served. We wait about an hour just sitting there and still no service so we get up and walk the fuck out. The lady at the front says ""Have a great day"" and we\'re all whatever about it. SOOOO DISAPPOINTED! If I could  I\'d give -5 stars."
Robert N.,Sacramento  CA,9,13,,7/16/2014,1.0,Ten of us for lunch on Sunday. Food came in shifts of two plates at a time by the time the ninth person was served the first people were through eating. My order did not come until after everyone else had eaten. Food was mediocre at best. Manager did comp my late meal. Personally I don't ever have to eat here again. While they had just opened a hour earlier we had a waitress change in the course of our meal. Poor staff management in my opinion.
Lindsay S.,West Sacramento  CA,22,4,,1/18/2012,2.0,The food was ok  but the service was very slow. I waited a good 5 minutes for the waitress to bring me ketchup before going inside and looking for it myself. It wasn't even busy! I also ordered Cream soda for dessert and never got it. The waitress never wrote down my order! When I finally told another server to just cancel the drink order( we were about to leave by this point)  she apologized and offered to comp it for me and bring it in a to go cup. Great. Except no one ever brought it to me and we finally just left without it.
Christian B.,San Francisco  CA,51,43,,9/14/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I\'ve just eaten at this restaurant again  coerced by a family member due to a school-fundraiser the night we went. BJs gives 15% of your check to the school  a noble goal I applaud. The applause ends there  however. On my first visit several months ago  it couldn\'t have been worse. This time  it was just plain old bad. I had salmon. Had that fish in life actually experienced salt water? One family member had mac & cheese. He\'s 7. I am sure he was delighted to see an exact replica of the Kraft version we serve at home. I wasn\'t. No one had a positive experience. Oh  did I mention the starter salad? A few shreds of iceberg  one slice of a rock-hard ""tomato""  and a few croutons. I had been asked if I wanted my salad dressing on the side or mixed in with the salad. I picked ""mixed in."" It arrived ""lumped on top of."" The server was nice and upbeat - but repeatedly intruded mid-bite  mid-sip (wine)  mid-word.  Through a horrible mischance  I managed yet again to go to another BJs  this one in Rocklin just a few nights before the Arden visit. JUST AS BAD! Stay clear of BJs if you want competent service and good food. AWFUL."
Phil K.,Sacramento  CA,156,138,5,12/5/2011,3.0,The food is great  beer selection legit  service is pretty bad. I dont really blame the staff itself  they are usually quite friendly  I blame the management. The bar area is always packed and they seem to be understaffed.
Steve B.,Livermore  CA,4,32,,9/30/2012,4.0,Food was excellent! It was a Saturday night so there was a bit of a wait with a family of seven. Service was good and everything was enjoyable. Most importantly the beer was cold and tasty!
Randall F.,Sacramento  CA,0,1,,6/16/2011,2.0,I'm sure the food would have been good if it hadn't been left out for 20 minutes. We ordered at 2  didn't received the food until 2:45. The appetizers were served the same time as our entrees  all of it completely cold. They just forgot to bring our food when it was ready. The servers look like they were hired based on their appearance rather than their skill. I agree with others that the food could be good  they just need to improve their level of service. The manager was kind enough to comp the bill and understood the problem; so at least they may be aware of the service issues.
Dreas L.,Sacramento  CA,1,13,,3/30/2011,1.0,I brought my family here for dinner last night and won't be back. I would rather drive a few miles and go to the BJ's in Natomas or in Roseville.It started out by waiting a few minutes at the hostess booth for her to acknowledge us. Apparently she was too busy in discussion with the Manager and a server regarding the server's assigned section for the night. They finally moved to the side then the hostess immediately took care of a couple that just walked in after us. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't see us even though no one else was around.We were then seated and our server took our order and served our drinks within a few minutes. After about 20 minutes  we inquired about our food since we only ordered 2 mini pizzas  a kid's meal and a salad. The place was fairly empty being that it was a weekday and only 5pm. The server said that our order would be out soon.After another 15 minutes  we inquired about our order again since our 3 year old was quite hungry. The server said that they had to remake one of the pizzas  however she made sure our order was pushed to the front of the line!?! At this point  we were done with this place as food was being delivered to people all around us that came in after us. I asked to have the food packed to go as our 3 year old wasn't able to sit any longer. I also asked to see a Manager since the wait time was ridiculous.The Manager talked to us for a few minutes  gave a less than sincere apology and that was it. Our order was finally brought to our table....with the exception of our 3 year old kid's meal. *Sigh* Yep  they forgot the kid's meal. We waited 10 more minutes for the kid's meal then packed all the food ourselves in the take-out containers  paid for the food and quickly left the place. Needless to say  we will never return.
Lana F.,Carmichael  CA,20,1,,7/29/2011,1.0,"When paying for your meal with your credit card never ever leave the ""tip and total"" blank!!!! Our waitress was Shannon I think was her name?... She did a horrible job but regardless we still left her a CASH tip... Two days later after checking my account I was charged $5 more then the amount I authorized! I call the restaurant and they fax me my reciept. Sure enough she writes in her own tip and the total!!!!!!! Apparently she thought she deserved more then what we gave her.! They refunded my $5 tip that she stole.. Its not about the $5.. I can care less .. She stole from me!!! I hope they have a no tolerance on this kind of stuff! People check your receipts!!!!! I never write reviews... This was just to bazar for me to leave out!!!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!!"
Meh S.,Sacramento  CA,37,42,19,3/21/2012,4.0,Came here with my cousin  had the the country fried steak. Couldnt finish it and it was a tad too dry for me. The place feels alive and good service. I havent come here enough to have a favorite dish yet.
Stephanie S.,Suisun City  CA,35,6,1,3/19/2011,1.0,"Went to promo grand opening and it was a horrible experience. Billy the floor manager was explaining that our food was traveling around the restaurant and that was why we didnt get it in timely manner. Once he found our pizza it had already been eaten by someone else so they ordered us another and in the meantime he brought out our desserts before our pizza. He explained that the kitchen is closed therefore he had to bring out the dessert. He also stated that ""we have to keep it moving because we have to be out by 9"". When we said we havent even had our pizza yet he stated ""well the kitchen is closed and thats why we are paying for the food tonight"". Not only did they seat our reserved party in two different tables  but could not have two drinks on one table.... One party member was double charged for drinks. It was a mess!!!! Our party from work will never go there again and will not recommend this specific location to anyone. In fact we are telling everyone!"
Sankari V.,Roseville  CA,3,76,118,4/25/2011,2.0,First visit 3 weeks ago was fabulous. So we ordered takeout the second time. The bread in our sandwich had mold in it. Called and complained. Decided to give it another shot. This time we were the first customers in the restaurant. Confusion at front desk as to where we should be seated. Looks like the hostess was new. Experience was okay at the best. The croutons in our salad were stale. Decided to try again last week. Long hair in our salad. Manager apologized and offerewd another salad. This is it. Can't screw up thrice in just over three weeks. Good Bye  BJ's.
Sarah C.,Sacramento  CA,263,28,4,5/2/2012,3.0,This was my third  maybe 4th time at this location. Each time I think the quality service has improved. I remember my first time here--maybe because the restaurant was still new-- the service was horrible! no refills  never checked back on us  ghetto servers etc.my last visit was last week for happy hour. I ordered Balsamic Glazed Chicken--my go to entree. I love the mash potato  flavors and all  although my chicken was a bit dry. We had calamari--which was a bit burnt. Also the Ahi Poke which was not as tart as I would like. I usually only go to BJ's when someone else mentions it  not my personal favorite  it's just convenient for late night happy hours  or since we're close by.
Jason F.,Carmichael  CA,8,24,,1/12/2013,2.0,Well the wait is not worth it at all i have been there alot and the wait just pisses me off i left there last night at 10 because of a 45 min wait and prior to that we ate there and it has by far the worst pizza on earth the people there a snoty and rude as well to many kiss ass yuppies trying to act like their shit don't stink
Melissa B.,Beaverton  OR,297,208,79,1/24/2012,3.0,The food is good  but the service is just... OK. It takes either standing up or flagging someone down a few times to get their attention. I'll cut them some slack though  because I know it's new. And I'd only eat there during happy hour.
Dave H.,Sacramento  CA,275,113,89,2/19/2012,3.0,its pretty good food. I DONT like rehearsed service though. No personalization. Trained monkey servers. Food is pricey and beers are as well. Good ambience though. Might go back.
Dane M.,Sacramento  CA,43,22,,11/8/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,The manager comped our dessert yesterday after they overcooked my burger. Still one of my favorite places to eat  and the second burger was tasty.
Istvan T.,Arden-Arcade  Sacramento  CA,0,2,2,5/22/2013,1.0,We went here with a couple of friends for my birthday dinner. I used to like this place: decent food with reasonable prices  good beers  etc. Our dinner was fine and I really wouldn't have any complaints about the place  but it turned out that I forgot a little envelope or little holder type of thing on our table  that had a gift card and a ticket to a show in it. That was my birthday present. About 45 minutes after leaving I realized what happened and I called them. The manager on duty told me the table was already cleaned (the place was closed already)  there was nothing left on it and nobody had turned anything in. It's been almost a week now  I have called a few times and their whole attitude is oh  well  that's pretty much gone and there's really nothing they can do for me. I have a real problem with a place like this. Somebody either took my things or threw it out by mistake. Either way BJ's should take responsibility for their employees' actions.
SassySusan K.,Sacramento  CA,0,15,,10/11/2012,2.0,Just ok. The food wasn't impressive and service was poor. I won't return. Can get better food at the food court.
Justin L.,Sacramento  CA,147,61,,5/31/2011,1.0,"One of the worst dining experiences I\'ve had in quite some time. Food was bland and uninspired at best. Service? What service? Waited ten min for my drink just tomb told they\'re out. Waited another 10 minutes for them to bring me a beer. Total wait time 20 min for one beer. Waited another 5-10 min for the girl to come take our orders. The tv was on an infomercial the whole time instead of sports ... Asked 3 times and yet the station was never changed. Also asked for horseradish 3 dif times and FINALLY got it by the time I had just about finished my meal. This is really nothing more than a very loud  ""brewery"" themed Cheesecake Factory. Oh and if I forgot to say it already... The service SUCKS!"
Esther S.,Sacramento  CA,130,72,16,1/17/2012,5.0,"I recommend using the call ahead feature available. i usually call about 5 for 6pm and im usually put first on the list (even on Friday & Saturday nights!). the menu offers a wide variety of items so there\'s something for everyone\'s appetite. the staff is very friendly and very accommodating. for the price you\'d pay for at your ""neighborhood"" regular spot   you can get much better quality and better choices. 5 stars!"
Wayne L.,West Sacramento  CA,20,104,14,1/10/2012,3.0,The burgers are above average  the place is clean and the service is great. Nothing special  just another Hard Rock Cafe styled burger joint. Avocado egg rolls are pretty good... I'll go back...
Brandon L.,Stockton  CA,125,71,103,1/10/2012,3.0,I've been to a lot of the locations actually  but this one was a little different. They didn't have the pasta I wanted :( But I got a crispy chicken sandwich with the thin fries  and that was pretty tasty. I went with my big  and it was just like any other BJ's I guess. The service was alright  but we did have a bit of trouble for a little while trying to get napkins from our waitress. No room for a pizookie though. BJ's is a nice place with a good eating environment. My big bro is gonna get me FAT though :(
Jill R.,Vacaville  CA,0,1,,9/11/2012,4.0,Had lunch today with my sister and BJ's and the service was great. The place was also clean. Good food.....We'll be back
Matt R.,El Segundo  CA,107,177,94,1/16/2012,3.0,Just like any other BJ's. This one is particularly new. Ate here Saturday night the 14th. Jamell was my waiter. He's a bit loud and over the top  but overall a nice guy. There was a good mix of people. Not too ghetto and not too fancy.
Allie S.,Sacramento  CA,28,108,2,12/18/2011,3.0,I think the delicious pizza's and beers may be the only thing most BJ's have on their side. I find the salads and soups mediocre. The appetizers are simple. But the service is typically nice and the lean menu is worth a looksy.
Nisa N.,Brooklyn  NY,376,241,84,4/14/2011,3.0,A great addition to Arden Fair Mall. I tried their Grand Cru brew and was pleased. I don't typically like dark beers but this was good and I also ordered the chicken marsala to pair with it. It went really well. My companion had a salad. BORING! The service was ok; our original server left during the middle of our service and her replacement was kind of slow. Otherwise  I'd return anytime I'm at the mall. Beer beats shopping!
Shelly S.,Sacramento  CA,0,20,,4/11/2014,3.0,I went here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't that crowded which was nice.  I ordered some chicken tacos and thought it was delicious. The waitress who helped us was pretty nice. The only thing I didn't like so much was the lighting inside the restaurant. It was really dark and it would have been nicer to be able to see what we were eating. Other thank that  I'd come here again for the food.
Kerry D.,Pineville  LA,1,17,,8/14/2012,3.0,"I live in Arden-Arcada  and after Sac Brew closed a few years ago- we have nothing here in the way of microbrew pubs (there is now Kilt Pub on Arden  a much smaller not so-interesting place). Anyway  when word BJ\'s was coming to this area- I immediately hoped they\'d take over the old Macaroni Grill location on Alta Arden (which now has become In n Out)  Obviously they didn\'t  and opted to go right inside the ghetto Arden Fair mall.... well  the consequences of that are apparent....For one  I can\'t stand the culture of the entire Arden Fair area- it is sooo ghetto. Thus I hoped putting the BJ\'s away from the mall a bit would help- but that didn\'t happen. So  most times I go to this place (since I have few other choices that aren\'t a difficult drive from my house) I deal with the typical ""Arden ghetto-kids"" who are a unique culture of ghetto-rap dressing  meth-head talking misfits who I really don\'t see around town BUT in this area!  And they are all often at BJ\'s- talking in their rattle-trap loud way as usual  ordering elaborate shots of liquor to impress their skanky girlfriends.. making the experience for those around them very annoying. I go to Roseville- I don\'t see these types of kids. I go to Reno- they don\'t exist there. It is just ARDEN! So the clientelle here sucks  period. But other than that  the food is always good  the beers are good with good selection  the service is mediocre (typical rather aloof hostesses that you encounter at most every other place in the Sacramento area). Also  I\'ve noticed the prices of their beers & food keep going up every time I visit this place practically- nearly approaching Yard House levels! You\'d think with the economy sucking in Sacramento  as well as nationwide- that places like this would get a clue and maybe- make things affordable?? I guess that light hasn\'t gone on in the heads of the owners here.But to sum up- good food  good beer  mediocre service  and really ghetto annoying clientelle- especially in the bar area. Really not the place to go to meet a quality random stranger- unless they are just there to shop  eat & escape quickly."
Michelle B.,Centennial  CO,60,59,3,1/12/2012,4.0,This is a newer location so it is still going through some growing pains  but the food is still delicious. It's a good place to grab a bite for happy hour and then maybe get some power shopping done. The servers seems nice and respond to new customers in a timely manner. I haven't sat in the dining area to have a meal  only at the bar  and that's because I don't want to wait for a table. The bar area is a little on the chilly side so bring a coat. All in all I'd go back again.
Christian Y.,Los Angeles  CA,23,6,,7/2/2011,3.0,"I personally love BJs  and usually enjoy any trip here. Except this time the service was quite bad  including a waiter pointedly ignoring our questions. We would ask them for water  but the two waiter waitress we asked said ""yeah ok"" then didn\'t get them until 10 minutes later. I had the BJ\'s Burger which was quite good  the garlic french roll was crispy and delicious and my medium rare burger was well received by my taste buds. Good food  bad service."
Denise L.,Houston  TX,23,146,84,8/4/2011,3.0,i do come here often because its convenient to work but i dread going there. there is always something i have issue with. usually its service related. i drink water and i am constantly having to ask for water refills. if it were a bar drink they would be there to offer to get me a new one every time i put the empty glass down  but i guess since its just water  they dont care whether or not i have water.
Juan A.,Lansing  MI,64,298,134,11/8/2011,4.0,Up to the standards of my usual Bj's.. Great food  great beer  great atmosphere  and friendly waitress....
Thanh N.,  Japan,172,314,87,9/10/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I received a call from the Manager at this location regarding my experience and he has sent a $25 gift card to make up for the bad service I experienced. =)
Sam H.,Sacramento  CA,2,2,,3/17/2012,4.0,Upon entering this establishment the lighting was just what I needed to relax after a long day of shopping with friends. The wait time was 30 minutes but we got lucky and got a table in the bar area. The drinks were fabulous and the food came within an appropriate timeframe of 20 min or so. Loved it!!
John C.,Citrus Heights  CA,5,193,20,11/1/2011,4.0,The pizza are the best I have ever had. I would strongly recommend the beer sampler. BJ's is just a great restaurant all around.
Jeannette C.,Sacramento  CA,94,31,19,9/25/2011,4.0,Good spot for a quick lunch with my kids before going inside the mall on a sunday afternoon. Service was fairly quick  we didn't have to wait too long for a table to be seated and food came before they finished coloring. Calamari was greasier than usual but otherwise  pizza & ck tenders with baffalo sauce were awesome!
Erin R.,Danville  CA,1,31,21,11/30/2012,2.0,We were on our way home from Tahoe on a Sunday and wanted to catch a little football so we stopped at BJ's in Sacramento. We sat in the bar which wasn't too crowded...and that's where it all began. SMH It took over 15 minutes just to get a menu and another 20 minutes for our waitress to bring us water & take our order. Again  they were not slammed so it was hard to figure out what was taking so long. We were all pretty hungry so the longer we waited the worse it got. After waiting for 40 minutes we finally got our food. And after all of that waiting...the waitress got my order wrong! A veggie burger on a wheat bun is not that complicated  right?!? So back to the kitchen it went and I didn't see it again for another 15 minutes SIGH. There is no reason lunch at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon should take over an hour and a half for 3 people. The food itself was alright but in no way could make up for the lack of attentiveness or pace of the service in which we received.
Ema M.,Carmichael  CA,34,29,57,8/1/2011,4.0,Great food. Great location  I thought the service was really good. I def. will be going back.
Chris C.,Elk Grove  CA,8,59,8,11/13/2013,1.0,I will never return!!  We told the waitress we were on lunch for work so you would think she would speed up the process.  It took 25 minutes for our food and another 15 minutes waiting for our check to be taken care of.  My food was cold and my burger was overdone.
Sarah B.,Galt  CA,56,203,61,3/29/2011,3.0,"Came last night to check out the newest Bj\'s over at the Arden Fair Mall. The food was good as it always is at all Bj\'s. You know nothing special  but really good for it being a chain. I tried something completely different than I usually get  the Roast Beef Dip with horseradish sauce  it was wonderful! I love horseradish and this complimented it perfectly. The BF got the pizza and it was cooked heavenly  crust so light and buttery. The service is another story. I understand that this is a brand new restaurant  which means there will be brand new servers  but I work in the mall and I know for a fact they were doing dry runs to practice for almost two weeks! That means they were serving food and customers before the opened to the public for almost two weeks. We were seated in the back and were not served in a timely manner. There were plenty of of other tables filled around us  other servers came and served the other tables  as we still waited. When we were finally served the server was very nice  but she had a head server or manager  not really sure was he was since he never introduced himself  with her. He literally stood there watching her with a stop watch in his hand! WEIRD! If she was training  then he or even she should have explained the uncomfortable situation that was in play. Through out our dinner he followed her to our table with out ever saying a word. The other thing that bothered me about the service was that there were TONS of servers  bussers  food runners all over the place and yet we were still ignored many a times. I work in a restaurant and if there are than many people hangin\' around the service should be on point! But I can\'t blame our server Jolene  she was nice and tried to be very helpful  it seemed she needed help at times  but that guy  Steve was his name  never did at all. Oh except once he asked  ""Is she getting you another beer?"" hahaha Oh well.As for decor  I love what they have done to the place. I seriously never knew there was so much space when it was California Cafe. The bar is awesome too  can\'t wait to come by after work one day. This Bj\'s is definitely going to be a great addition to the mall."
Jenny Y.,Sacramento  CA,148,196,593,7/23/2011,3.0,I love the BBQ Chicken pizza from this place. I've tried the pastas before and it's not bad  but I rather order a pizza when I come here instead. The pizookie's are delicious  too bad they down sized it for the birthday person. I don't have any complaints about this place. Good customer service  but sometimes the wait does get long.
Nick W.,San Diego  CA,25,61,17,7/12/2011,3.0,"I have to admit that I\'ve been to two different BJ\'s and this one is a lot fancier than the one I\'ve been to back in La Jolla. It is relatively new and I have to say that the food is just as good as the other place. Parking: Parking is pretty easy to find since there are lots all around the place  since it\'s in the mall. Plus if you walk far  you can really walk off that pizookie. Service: I didn\'t have to wait very long when I came into the restaurant. The hostess was really nice and offered us indoors or patio and was very nice about it. My waitress was relatively nice and always checking in on us. I ordered a Mango Tango because I felt like having a drink  and it didn\'t come out right away. The waitress came back and asked me if I had gotten my drink yet and took care of it. She was always upfront with us and very polite making sure that we were satisfied with everything. Food: We got the BJ\'s combo deep dish pizza and I wasn\'t fully pleased with it  but I did enjoy it. When I normally go to BJ\'s I get the Great White or BBQ Chicken Pizza; however  because my friend didn\'t enjoy spicy  we went with the combo. There wasn\'t really anything special with it. The sausage was well done  but everything else just seemed okay to me. My Mango Tango seemed like it had too much rum in it. I wasn\'t sure what to do  since I didn\'t want to send it back. But yeah  I could definitely taste more of the alcohol after a bit  and since I needed to drive  I passed on drinking it after having a couple sips. Then afterwards  we ordered the pizookie trio  and I have to say that pizookies have definitely gotten worse. They used to be in a bigger pan  now they come out in a small dinky pan. I\'m utterly disappointed because I used to come to BJ\'s just for the Pizookie. The oreo pizookie wasn\'t that great in my opinion. It was really dry even with the ice cream  because of the fashion that oreo cookies are. The chocolate chip and white chocolate chip and macadamia nut ones were alright though. It\'s just sad the fact that because of everything in the world  things are getting cut. Overall  my experience though was good. I like the environment of this restaurant over the one back in La Jolla. I like how there\'s a lot of space  a big bar  and nice dining areas. On top of that  the food quality wasn\'t poor  but it wasn\'t grand. I think it\'s because of the pizza we got  but yeah  hard to tell. I definitely say  that if you haven\'t experience something like BJ\'s  then you should check this place out. My friend compared the pizza we got to the one at Chicago fire  and she really couldn\'t decide which one she liked better. Although  she did enjoy the ""cookie pizza"" more than the pizookies. The reason why I can\'t give it more than average  is because the place isn\'t better than what I expected it to be. It was just your average place that gave you what you want  not beyond that."
Chuck D.,Rohnert Park  CA,1,37,,3/4/2012,5.0,Excellent food  atmosphere  and service. Prices are excellent for this level of dining. I will definitely come back.
Danny C.,Oakland  CA,218,43,2,8/7/2011,3.0,Tends to get really crowded  but their hefe is my favorite.
Josiah P.,Sacramento  CA,215,38,2,5/17/2011,2.0,Fried artichoke hearts were good. Jambalaya was entirely too salty. Should have stuck with pizza.
Michelle A.,Rocklin  CA,96,2,,9/28/2011,3.0,Really  how can you go wrong with a huge chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream?
D. L.,Sacramento  CA,17,94,10,5/13/2011,3.0,. . . i went to the newly opened bjs at arden to watch a couple of playoff games . . . i ordered my usual . . . a bjs favorite along with an orange cream soda . . . it wasnt too bad . . . the place was fairly packed with a nice crowd . . . a mix of college students and grown folks . . . service was prompt and good . . . my pizza was fluffy with lots of tomatoes (one of the many ways i like my pizza done) . . . i like the fact that this particular bjs had more flat screens than your average bjs in the sacramento area . . . though ive seen way more at buffalo wild wings . . . if there was a way that i could give this bjs an extra half star to make 3.5 stars i would because that is what i felt about this particular visit . . . not too bad but at the same time i wasnt expecting this place to knock my sox off . . . good place to relax and unwind or to bring a date . . .
Susan D.,Sacramento  CA,0,9,,11/27/2013,4.0,Stopped in for an early dinner with a party of three. I really enjoyed the parmesan crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes. My dinner companions also enjoyed their meals (chicken alfredo and balsamic chicken). I liked the atmosphere  upscale yet casual and I have to say the service was good also. I will go back to try other menu offerings.
M C.,Sacramento  CA,0,80,10,9/5/2013,3.0,Good food  nice happy hour  I'll go back. The only negative is the margarita's are probably some of the worst in town...this chain needs to fix their recipe.
Brandon H.,Galt  CA,51,6,1,8/7/2011,5.0,I love BJ's! I haven't had anything there that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. From their soups and salads  to their steak and desserts  everything is delicious there. And they pretty much have everything on their menu. Especially their in house brewed beers  and root beer  yum! You can easily spend $50 for two people without breaking a sweat. But it's worth it. The environment is appealing  the servers are friendly  but I'd recommend calling ahead  as there is almost always a wait.
M B.,Houston  TX,0,50,1,7/13/2012,5.0,Walked in around 430 and sat at bar. Waited on in 10 seconds. Had margarita and then a couple of beers. Had wedge saad with a mini pizza. Great deal. Good food and excellent service. Happy hour prices are excellent.
Joe F.,Los Angeles  CA,3,13,,5/25/2011,3.0,A good example of a restaurant that tries to do too many things. The result is a very AVERAGE experience. Not bad...just not great.
Jess B.,Sacramento  CA,38,11,,9/16/2011,4.0,BJ's has a great selection of food and beer. If you can  hit up the lunch specials or happy hour for great prices. They also offer specials during NFL games.
Stacia O.,Isleton  CA,3,2,,6/24/2013,2.0,We chose this restaurant over others nearby because we thought they could handle a 11 person party. We waited along time for seating and then our buzzer really wasn't working. We had a round of a couple different waiters  the last one was really pretty good. But the food took forever to come. It was our 12yrs birthday so they did bring a candle on a dessert for her  which made her day but then the other kids desserts didn't come for along time. They all sat around looking at hers! I just felt that the restaurant was very slow on the food. I had a BBQ chicken salad but it had just a little bit of chicken  and one of our party's pizza was cold. Overall we won't be back. It wasn't the experience we expected. We live an hour away and when we drive that far to visit a restaurant it needs to be better than that.
Lai P.,Sacramento  CA,2,34,2,6/22/2011,5.0,I LOVE THIS PLACE. The waiters/waitresses are very friendly. Their food is awesome. I think  their price is awesome for the amount of good they give. I find this place cheaper then apple bee's and chili's. BJ's is an amazing place with a wonderful atmosphere.
sofia m.,Sacramento  CA,1,12,,4/9/2011,4.0,The food and service is great! I really liked their food  but it was so loud  and it was pricey. Overall good food  but it was expensive and I had to yell at my group so that they could hear me.
T S.,Ladera Ranch  CA,3,62,,9/22/2012,4.0,I love Bj's Restaurants! I have been to the one in Newport Beach  CA  West Covina  CA  Rancho Cucamonga  CA  Natomas  CA  and this location. Their pizza is delish! I love the deep dish style of Chicago style pizza. My favorite lately has been their buffalo chicken pizza. Before that  it was the one with Alfredo sauce. Both are so good! And of course  you have to have a pizooke for desert... yummy! The 2 for $20 deal they have every so often is great! It makes for a perfect cheap date night with my man the nights we need a little one on one time away from the kids.
scott s.,Sacramento  CA,29,56,8,9/1/2012,4.0,had a nice lunch new item chicken-mango salad.chic done perfect seasoned well just a nice lunch with good service my 4th visit.
Dana C.,Rancho Cordova  CA,85,19,,9/25/2011,2.0,"This place is just OK. Service when it first opened was very slow. We were lucky to get a drink every hour. They have gotten better over the past few months. Once when I went there I asked for outdoor seating. They said ""why yes  we have a table right there (she showed us the table)  let us clean it up"". I sat there and waited about 2 minutes and they seated us. But not at the table she showed us at a much smaller table because 2 girls came up and took our table and they didn\'t want to tell them it was taken for someone else. So she shoved 3 of us with a table for 1 or 2 in the middle of the aisle  versus telling these young ladies that the table was already taken  but offer then the smaller table which would have been more appropriate.  Now it\'s the laughing joke  that you better run and grab the table before someone else sits down cause the Hostesses don\'t have any backbone to provide ""good customer service""."
M W.,San Francisco  CA,0,64,95,5/1/2011,1.0,We had the luck of coming to this restaurant 1 week after it opened. They didn't have their logistical process down and so we -their beta testing paying patrons had to suffer. We came in and it took 15 minutes to get a waiter. We received our menus and waited an additional 15 minutes to place our orders. We then waited FORTY FIVE MINUTES for our meals. We finally flagged down the waitress who ran to check on our meals and then brought out two of our three dishes. Our two dishes had been forgotten under the heat lamp so they were dried out  the only edible pasta from my dish was the pasta that was under the sauce  all the pasta that was on the outskirts of the plate was hardened from the heat lamps. The manager came out to apologize and told us they were new and working out the kinds. He informed us our third dish would be out shortly and it would be on the house. Twenty minutes pass and voila our their pasta dish magically appears. Here's the kicker - it was completely tasteless  no sauce was added! The noodles tasted like plain olive oil. The manager came back and apologized for the fluke dish and let my friend choose yet another item to order. He recommended the deep dish pizza - at this point my friend was starving two hours had passed and he didn't care so he went with the pizza. The pizza was out in 15 minutes  the manager rushed it over to us and personally served it. He sat and ate his meal and we watched him since we had already finished our two dishes 30 minutes earlier. The last and final nail in the coffin was when our bill arrived it was wrong  they had charged us for the tasteless pasta and the pizza when neither was suppose to be on the bill. The manager came out for a fourth time and apologized and fixed it.  There are a lot of Bj's out there  before one opens they should send trained staff and a trained manager to nail down the logistical and strategic processes before opening... this restaurant failed miserable at both.  I'd recommend going to Cheesecake they are right across the parking lot  have a great menu and they offer bread appetizers while you wait for your food to arrive.
Paru V.,Sacramento  CA,3,8,,12/3/2012,4.0,This is my first time there. I am no fan of pizza but my friend compelled me that I should give a try there. I got a pizza and a stuffed mushroom. It was the yummiest lunch I ever had. Staff were super friendly. I should say if I wanna have pizza I will definitely come here.
Ben W.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,4,,7/16/2011,2.0,I love bj's  but unfortunately this is the only one near me. I was so eager to come here because it just newly opened. I was seated by a very friendly waitress who seated me at the corner of the restaurant and forgot about me! I tried to flag down any worker in sight  but nobody could see me from where I was sitting! I tried to be patient and wait For a while. I eventually got up and left and drove to the bj's in Natoma which was a lot better! I won't stop eating at bj's  but I definitely won't come back to this one.
Kristine D.,Fairfield  CA,61,340,159,10/14/2011,5.0,good food. i ordered the flatbread pizza and fried artichokes. they were really good! and so was the calamari! the drinks were great also! the berry cider and the peach mixed drink was stellar! i would definitely go here again and the waiter was super funny and had such good service all around!!! the best BJ's i've been to in a while!!!
Theane B.,Sacramento  CA,4,19,,2/18/2012,4.0,great gluten free pizza and friendly staff
Agent G.,San Francisco  CA,3,42,43,4/4/2012,3.0,I've always heard good things about this place  but the food never tasted anything near spectacular for me. I had the pizza once (heard good reviews)  the appetizer tray  the famous Pizookie (overly sweet  soggy cookie)  and a couple other dishes. The only thing I liked were the Kamikaze's I had there for my 25th birthday  they were great! You can't really mess up vodka  though..
Britt W.,Sacramento  CA,0,4,,7/27/2011,1.0,"I went to BJ\'s a few weeks ago with a friend. I ordered soup and salad and she ordered an appetizer and salad. My soup and salad came up 5 minutes later. I tried signaling the wait staff but they all seemed to busy to notice. I may be in my younger 20s but that doesn\'t give you an excuse to ignore a customer. I am a server myself at a restaurant and I give full attention to every table I serve. My friend told me to go ahead and eat my food before it got cold. I was now finished with my food and we were going on 20 minutes still waiting for her appetizer. It finally came out with her entree salad as well. When our waitress a younger blonde girl came to our table to deliver her food i kindly told her that i received my meal 20 minutes ago and she is just now getting her food. She told me ""Well thats what happens when you order soup and salad at dinner  its a lunch item."" I told her that the soup and salad is on her dinner menu as well and she just said ""I had to write it on the ticket during dinner time so it wouldn\'t come up early."" She walked away after that and I sat and pondered why she didn\'t tell the cooks to hold off on the soup and salad as an entree then..This wasn\'t my fault but she had turned it around to be. If someone orders an appetizer make sure that comes out before the meals thats the whole point. There was no apology no compensation and this will be the last time I go to that BJ\'s."
Jan B.,Sacramento  CA,0,31,,5/21/2012,2.0,If you like tough  stringy chicken and a few other things on the plate with about a cup full of salt then BJ's balsamic chicken is the dish for you!
Jason T.,Stockton  CA,61,9,,5/14/2012,2.0,Very slow service and not very good at remembering little requests such as extra plate  sauce  refills
Ray G.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,6/7/2012,4.0,Came to BJ's while i was shopping at the mall. Love having one here now. The Pizza is my favorite. Service was great  everyone was very friendly. I Didn't have to wait at all to be seated that the food came out very quick. I will definitely be coming back!!
Sheena E.,Lake Elsinore  CA,442,371,409,7/20/2011,3.0,As of right now its 3 stars....that may change. Our first time here was after working a long day at the fair and we wanted something yummy! We ordered the calamari and a veggie pizza. The calamari took forever!! So long in fact that it came out RIGHT before our pizza. It was cold and really dry...we had to send it back  then came our pizza  which was a small and they said 6 pieces  the pieces were tiny! Then they brought the new calamari which was much better. They ended up taking it off our bill which was nice of them. We went a second time and sat in the bar area for happy hour  we got individual pizza's which were really good actually! Much better then sharing a small and since they were half off we got them for about $5 each so it was cheaper then a small! We also got the avocado egg rolls that time and I remember those being much better then what we got  the sauce was way too sweet and the egg rolls were way too greasy. So far its just an ok  3 stars.
Trevor S.,Sacramento  CA,121,140,8,4/28/2011,4.0,it's BJ's... just at Arden now. parking sucks  but it's at a mall so that's to be expected.
Amber O.,Sacramento  CA,0,17,3,4/29/2011,4.0,Went to BJ's last Friday for for drinks and appetizers around 8ish. The place was very busy and there would have been a 20 minute wait  but we opted to sit outside. Great decision! There were overhead heaters that provided plenty of warmth. We orders Martini's and they were great along with two appetizers. We spent about $50 all together with tip  but it was well worth it. I recommend BJ's for a casual night out anytime.
Vance H.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,6/30/2011,4.0,Eat here last week. It different from other bj I been too. Love the beer selection and menu choice. Good food good service. Be back.
Devin M.,Sacramento  CA,1,6,,9/14/2011,1.0,So its a friday night and I figure that I would come to the BJ in arden. I normally frequent the Laguna one which has exceptional food and great beers. My friend and I ordered a beer...The beer came out...not cold and not quite warm. I honestly have not been served a beer that wasn't cold enough before. We let the server know who was more than willing to help. She tried to help get us different beers but it still came out like barely chilled beer. She explained to us about the tap and the system. On top of that our order came out wrong...We ended up waiting again for our appetizer. We ordered the special deal of pizza with pazookie and soup and salad for a deal.  The soup was lukewarm. I figure you know what the pizza should be better...wrong again. It ends up being as a warm pizza also...so then our deserts come out...guess what same thing. It wasn't hot but its not the quality of BJ that I have experienced. Either the management is not doing their job or the kitchen staff needs help. maybe the beer filtration system needs an upgrade. I'm not sure but this type of service from BJ is unacceptable. I am not coming back to this BJ.
Brian R.,Beaverton  OR,2,18,,5/1/2011,1.0,"Been here before with a smaller party and had no problems. Last night (I know it was a Saturday...) tried to use their call ahead reservation system and was told it was for parties of 6 or smaller. We had 6 and a 2 year old. Showed up at 6:15 and were told it would be about an hour wait. We thought ""That\'s just what they tell people so they don\'t get angry for waiting 30 minutes."" At 7:15 the two year old was offered crackers. At 7:45 my diabetic Mother was offered juice. At 7:50 ""Just a few more minutes while they clean up the table that just left."" I look  it\'s already clean  and seems to have been for a few minutes already. 8:00  we\'re seated. By the way  two managers have been circling the hostess station the whole time  not a single word or acknowledgement. Appitizers and drinks were brought out fast (1 star)  but my Dad\'s food was left in the back for about 10 minutes while waited (not wanting to be rude to him). The server was notified of this and brought it right out  as if had just been sitting there and forgotten. The food? Eh. Same restaurant-in-a-mall food you would expect. Left after the mall was closed at almost 9:30  still without a word from a manager. I understand they\'re busy  but all restaurants are busy on Saturday night. Won\'t be going back  ever."
Sky P.,Sacramento  CA,0,14,,1/16/2012,2.0,While this place definitely has good food  they are not winners when it comes to service with a smile. I went in to talk to the manager about having a large group in to celebrate the holidays with my family. It might seem strange  but we usually get a group together and go out to eat so that we can all enjoy our time together  not be stressing about cooking and cleaning. This group would have been for 30ish people on a Tuesday night. The Manager rudely looked at me and said we are all booked up before he even let me tell him the date or time. Unless he is a mind reader  I don't know how he could have predicted what I was going to say. I would have been fine with the answer if he had at-least checked the reservations  but to not even let me tell him the information was just rude and leaves me wondering if it was more a case of him not wanting the extra work  or simply not wanting my business. The hostesses were no joke  even laughing while he was dismissing me. Beware of this place  they may have good food  but the quality of the food does not make up for an atmosphere of rude service.
