Margaret V.,"Canton, MI",286,1088,186,4.0,7/15/2017,"We were very impressed with our visit. The location is great! Right off the interstate and near plenty of hotels, and other shopping. We were greeted quickly and offered a table right off of the main dining room.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very friendly. Our waitress was Jen and she was very kind and attentive.  Needless to say,  Applebees has plenty of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, soups, salads, pasta, and steak. It's a chain, but this location is worth a visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1418,1110,17414,4.0,10/31/2017,"Great courteous service. Also, very quick! We got a free mozzarella sticks by checking in on Yelp. Any appetizer is free with a Yelp check-in. Fiancée's mom ordered a grilled cheese with a side of fries. She liked it a lot. Fiancée ordered a tasty grilled salmon with steamed broccoli. All fresh and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6

Karen N.,"Macomb, MI",12,171,1243,4.0,9/18/2016,"I met a friend for lunch here at 12pm on a Wednesday. Greeted quick, sat at a booth. Our server was Eric, very nice and efficient.  We both enjoyed our lunch meals, breaded chicken Asian salad. My half a club sandwich and honey pepper chicken mac n cheese was delicious. Lunch price of 6.99 is reasonable for a great meal !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6
Cinthia R.,"Macomb, MI",42,94,386,3.0,2/6/2016,"Hostess sat us right away as we came in the back door because my mom wasn't able to make it all the way to the front door. Hostess was courteous and helpful with this and sat us right away at the nearest table so my mom wouldn't have to walk too far. Although, it took our waitress a while to get to our table I was quite pleased with her demeanor, nice and polite. I asked for her suggestions on food and she was very informative.  I asked if I could order the kids food first so it could come out right away. I ordered the green bean crushers and wonton tacos. Both came out piping hot and delicious! 5 stars for this part of our visit.  Atmosphere: The music was so loud it was to the point where it was obnoxious and unbearable. I know this is a place to hangout and drink but it was well before 10pm. If it were 10 pm and later I could understand. Our waitress was nice enough to ask for it to be turned down a hair. Which was very nice. Although loud it was bearable. Minus 1 star for this portion of our visit.  Entrees: bourbon chicken and shrimp plate, came out hot and was tasty. The chicken was slightly over cooked so it was on the verge of being dry. I was disappointed that I didn't get but 2 mushrooms mostly onions and they weren't sautéed too well. The shrimp was tasty and was not over cooked. The red potatoes were good lacked flavor. Minus 1 star for the lack of flavor for the entrees.  Mom ordered the cedar salmon: I tasted everything on her plate to provide this review. Salmon was just a hair over cooked and seriously lacked flavor. The spinach and zucchini that come on the plate were so bland. Spinach was cooked perfectly and the zucchini was soggy. I'm giving it four stars because the hostess and waitress were friendly. I wish I could give it 5 stars buuttt the amount of over cooked food and lack of flavor take away from a 5 star rating. One more thing waitress did not introduce herself, which is sad because I would ask for her again but I don't know who she is. Overall experience was pleasant and I will return.  3 star rating work on flavor and properly introducing yourselves with customers and the ambiance before 10pm so it's not clubish and you have my 5 star rating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6
Timothy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,32,8,1.0,7/25/2017,Our food was not good at all. Staff was playing around taking to each other rather than doing their job. Manager was doing good visiting tables and a busboy/host was working hard as well. Seems like staff walks all over the manager though. Bad service. Bad food. Will stay away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6
Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,234,5,3.0,5/9/2016,"Came here for lunch last week.  Excellent, prompt service, and the food was exactly what I expect from an Applebees.  Nothing fabulous, but of good quality. This restaurant was extremely drafty and cold.  It did not make for a pleasant experience.  It seemed like the entire building was like that, not just the area where we were seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6

Kelly S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",38,185,184,4.0,4/22/2015,"4 stars for the drinks and 1 dinged off star for the chicken tenders looking and tasting like chicken nuggets.   The chicken tenders were thin and small with a lot of breading.   They make the best sangria's I have ever tasted.  The Sangria is excellent because it comes in a nice large glass and is filled with a sweet, smooth wine and plenty of fresh fruit.  A lot of restaurants leave out the fresh fruit or they just add one or two pieces of fruit. This Applebee's cuts the fruit to an appropriate size and adds lots of it.  I had a glass of sauvignon Blanc, it was served chilled and it only cost me $3.00 because it was happy hour.  Our server, Eric, was excellent.   The decor is fun but the booths are starting to show their age with the seats caving in and backs pushing out.  Overall this is a great place to meet friends or dine with family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6

Linda S.,"Utica, MI",17,18,2,2.0,1/22/2016,"I really like the food at Applebee's and I was really exciting they expanded the gluten-free menu. I have eaten at other Applebee's with no problems, but last week, when I ate there and my meal was first brought wrong, I sent it back. It look pretty much the same, but I was told it was right. Well, all this week I have been sick with my Crohn's. Why offer something that you can't provide? I eat early, so the kitchen isn't busy and order simple .....thanks  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6

But are you going to get some BALLER ass half off appetizers? Hell yes you are. Are you going to be treated to a playlist of the greatest 90s pop hits? You better believe it. Should you get an Italian entree and expect a good meal? Absolutely not. But if you play it safe you will come out satisfied and smiling.

Christopher Z.,"Sterling Heights, MI",80,8,,1.0,3/13/2014,"There's nothing that gets me more excited than the perfect fusion of depressing low end bar with a low end family restaurant, so Applebee's was the obvious first choice for me. Imagine a sexy dad looking over his laptop at the bar at a depressed middle aged asian woman... she stares at his monster energy drink beanie thinking about how nothing gets her more dripping wet than peeling it from what's left of his hair and leans over her half off disgusting appetizer and takes a sip from his pepsi product. they eat a week old reheated little ceasers quality breadstick together and both think ""does it get any better than this""? This wasn't my experience. Mine was much worse. This place is not a good place to eat food or be at, ever.

Magick K.,"Washington, MI",8,29,1,5.0,11/25/2014,The oriental chicken salad is my favorite thing and today it was perfect.

Mike T.,"Macomb, MI",12,4,4,3.0,5/11/2014,Deciding to eat here on mothers day evening was a mistake. We were seated straight away but it was packed and full of kids. Naturally many were screaming and making a fuss. It took 10 minutes to be greeted with our drink order. The wait staff was clearly in the weeds and they did not seem prepared for the rush. We had no silverware when our salads arrived and were told they were out and were being washed. The food was OK but seemed overdone.

I understand that it's a chain restaurant and blahblahblah but I'm always very happy after I leave. Their two for twenty is a great deal and is enough food to feed 3.

Tiffany S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",28,10,5,5.0,1/1/2013,I like to visit this location and sit in Annette's section.  She is so personable and makes each table feel as if they are the only one in her section.  We like to visit on Saturdays after 10pm because of the half-price appetizers.  Can't beat the price and the service with Annette!  Under $15 two people can share a couple appetizers and sodas.  Not bad!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6?start=20
Craig M.,"Macomb, MI",52,123,110,2.0,12/28/2008,"With Applebee's, if you keep your expectations low you will not be disappointed. Burgers, Salads, Chicken Fingers all unimaginative, but all within their ability to deliver something decent.  But last night even my low expectations were not realized. After an afternoon of shopping, my wife and I stopped for a meal. She ordered a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered the 10 Oz Cajun Sirloin Steak, medium-rare.  When the dishes were delivered some 30 minutes later, her Chicken Sandwich was fine, but my steak was burnt. Medium would have been acceptable, medium-well would have been passible.  But this steak was well passed well-done and bordered on shoe leather. Clearly the cook forgot about this steak on the grill and clearly, the waiter didn't even look at it either.  So the waiter took it back to the kitchen and said he would put a priority on the recook. The new steak arrived 25 minutes later. So let me understand this, when the side dishes already made, it takes 25 minutes to grill a medium-rare steak? With priority?  Perhaps my expectations of mediocracy were just set too high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-utica-6?start=20
