17,Danny T.,"Slidell, LA",7,62,108.0,4.0,2015-12-06,"I had Red Robin once before trying this one. My first experience was really good so naturally I had to try out the new one in Slidell! We (a party of three) went in and immediately saw there was a wait, which we were expecting anyway. They estimated the wait to be 15 minutes then took our name and phone number. Within 10 minutes I got the text saying they were ready for us.  Overall, the place is up-to-date and clean. Every table has their computer/tablet thing which the guests use to order their appetizers, desserts, and some specialty drinks. It took a while for our server, Dawn, to greet us & get our drinks, but it was understandable considering how busy it was.  We ordered our appetizers and they were out within 10 minutes. We orders our entrees and they arrived within probably 15 minutes. Pretty fast! I got the chili burger. It was pretty good & very messy. We also had the seafood plate thing which was pretty tasty & a good portion. Overall the food was good & the service was even better. Dawn was great; she was attentive & got us refills on everything before we had to ask, though she was a little too talkative. But I guess I'd rather someone full of life & energy than someone who seemed like they hated their job. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely try out their bottomless root beer floats! It's a great deal!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
58,Floyd D.,"Slidell, LA",0,19,1.0,2.0,2015-12-11,I went there last Friday and the line was out the door so we didn't go in. This Friday we gave it another try. When we got there at 5:45 they told us they didn't have any French fries just sweet potato fries. My wive didn't mind so we went in because I figured they would substitute a side if you didn't want sweet potato fries. We waited a few along with a number of people and when we got seated I looked around and seen a few open tables but at least the wait wasn't long. We order the drinks which came quick and the waitress said just sweet potato fries for the substitute and the sides were extra. So we sat through two game of hangman waiting for the waitress to come back and called it a night for Red Robbin. The place seemed very crazy for only a few people in there (not that big). Well I still don't know if they got a decent burger and will give it try another day in about a month and a little more on their feet. I will also make a point to update this review. I hate to be negative but like to see the place succeed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
15,Shercole K.,"New Orleans, LA",291,423,734.0,4.0,2015-12-13,"I always saw the commercial for Red Robin, but never paid much mind to it and assumed it was more fast food place, but I was wrong. This is an actual restaurant, which is good for groups, low-key dates and family outings. The parking situation is also good! It is located within the Fremeaux Shopping area so there is ample lot parking! I went during opening week! Even though it was super crowded, service was good and they got things done! The server was great, I sat at the bar....Yes there is a bar. I went with the Bacon Cheeseburger with Steak Fries... Talk about good. It was yummy so tasty and a pretty great burger! I would definitely go back to try one of the many burger options they have on the menu!

51,Darren D.,"Slidell, LA",60,83,49.0,3.0,2015-12-21,First time to visit a Red Robin. The place was clean and the decor was very nice. Everyone was very polite and courteous and the waiter/bartender took good care of us very well. My burger was just OK. It was a bit over-cooked for my taste and didn't come as I ordered it (asked for no tomato but got tomato). The onion strings on the burger were very tough. I couldn't bite through or break them. Fries were great!!  Prices were in line for the atmosphere and menu offerings. Will try again to see if burger was just a fluke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

54,Christopher K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",15,1,,1.0,2016-01-20,"This was my first time to a Red Robins restaurant and will honestly be the last. We stood by the front door for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging us or seating us... Mainly because no one was around. When we were seated, it took another 5 minutes to get drink orders in. 10 minutes to receive our drinks and order. It took over an hour to get 2 burgers with garlic Parmesan fries. The waitress kept saying ""it was almost done."" ""Oh I know it's taking a little longer than normal, I have the manager looking into it."" After the long wait... It was a cold dry burger that was desperately undercooked for a medium burger. The meat was not even remotely warm.. I wish it sat under a heat lamp for another 10 minutes to actually warm/cook the burger. 15 minutes after finishing our fries they asked if we wanted more.. Luckily those fries were scalding just out of the frier hot. The garlic Parmesan fries were the only redeeming factor of the place. And after all of this... A $50 check. Thanks, I'll go elsewhere next time since there is so much burger competition in the area.

The service was good though toward the end it seemed kind of slow.  Then again, they do have these fancy-dancy machines on the table for you to pay with so. . .  The decor is cool and fun. The table top game was fun to play as well. But I was mostly excited about the menu.  Having recently readjusted to mostly paleo myself, I was thrilled to see the option for burgers wrapped in lettuce. In fact, the availability of substitutions for sides plus the really great burger choices deserve another visit.  My one complaint is that I would like a bigger choice of how my burger is cooked. ""A little pink or well done"" are not very acceptable to me, however the other options and ease of working with my eating habits may bring me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

Their wings over kettle potatoes are awesome too. I didn't need an extra order of bottomless fries. The burgers, while expensive in my opinion, are cooked as ordered and delicious.

27,Buz B.,"Slidell, LA",17,128,22.0,4.0,2016-02-15,"Over all pleasant experience with decent food and a fun atmosphere and attentive bar staff. Stopped here on a friday night of all nights, expecting a wait. There was a wait, but the bar was free and clear, so we sat there with no wait at all. What I didn't like initially about this place is that the bar area is hidden behind a giant wall, so we had to ASK if there was one.   The beer I got came fresh and cold in a proper Sam Adams glass, which I loved and the menu all looked appetizing. I got the Nantucket platter because I was in the mood for some fish and chips. The lady friend got some kind of burger which she thought was really good. The Nantucket platter came with beer battered cod, fried shrimp and clam strips. It was all good except with a few complaints. The fish came out in large nugget shaped lumps instead of a strip or filet, and wasn't easy to eat. The shrimp was a bit overdone and way too crispy, but those clams and fries were all right. The atmosphere in there is fun and they have tv's all around so there's a good bit to keep your attention. The bar staff was friendly and fun and when the time came for the check, they just set you up with a little Kiosk thingy of your own, which I REALLY liked. I reckon I'll go back again and try an actual burger, but I'm not really a restaurant burger kind of guy. Over-all it was enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
12,James B.,"Broadmoor, New Orleans, LA",223,219,253.0,4.0,2016-02-23,"So, driving aimlessly on a Sunday afternoon we decide to go to the Red Robin. Small wait, but the chalkboards for the kids to play with made it pass by much faster. This place is uber kid friendly. It was almost designed for children and parents with children. When you are the parent of loud (Most are loud) toddlers, you look for places with ambient noise just below a roar to mask your childs ""Not so Inside"" voices. Red Robin does this nicely. We were seated quickly and ordered first for the kids. This too is a must so that they do not have to wait long to get their food which caused some level of blissful silence as they eat. Also, this lessens the time spent blocking them from grabbing at everything on the table. If you are in the food service industry and do not know this fact, always get the kids order first. ALWAYS!! And never strive to serve the family together unless the kids are older.. NEVER!! I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double, with an egg added for, well flavor. The bottomless fries were good, hot, crisp and tasty. My burger was ample and delicious. I love any establishment which will allow me to add a fried, runny egg to the top of my burger because it just completes the burger in my opinion. All in, a very enjoyable experience. Kids, happy-Wife, happy- Wallet- happy, Daddy- happy!! AND I signed up for their loyalty card which gives me a free burger on my birthday. Can you argue with free food?? Nay, nay, nay I say..

That aside today was my second trip to red robin and I specifically went there to get the ""endless"" sweet potato fries. I love sweet potato fries and there aren't many places that have them on the menu. I got a cheeseburger and ordered the fries, ate one order of fries (which was small, about half the size of a normal order of fries) and ordered another. 15 minutes later I asked the server where they were and he said ""oh let me go check"" he came back 10 minutes later and said ""they burned them, it'll be about 15 minutes for them to remake some."" I was with my wife and she had already finished eating and was waiting to leave so I told him never mind. I would chalk this up to just a mistake in the kitchen BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AT THIS EXACT SAME LOCATION! The last visit they said the kitchen burnt the fries then as well. Either they need to hire new cooks or be honest about the ""endless"" or bottomless or whatever they call them fries. I didn't even eat half my burger Bc I was saving room for those stupid fries.

They have a great looking menu. Several burgers, sandwiches and plates available. The shakes look really good. I ordered the BBQ burger. Can't remember what they call it. Very underwhelming. The cheese on the burger wasn't melted and was hard and the burger was drowning in runny BBQ sauce. The meat had no taste to it and was undercooked. I opted for macaroni and cheese as my side rather than fries which I believe was $1.00 extra. The portion that I received was laughable.Very small. It was a bit of macaroni with a tad of cheese sprinkled on top and melted. No taste. My hamburger and macaroni were nearly $15. Way overpriced for what you get. They really need to step up their game here. I forgot to mention we had to wait several minutes at the door twiddling our thumbs waiting to be seated. We were the only ones waiting and there were only two other tables in the place at the time. Probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

How is a frozen over-cooked pre-made patty gourmet????? No flavor at all and poor quality meat. Sweet potato fries are frozen and not fresh. Just go to Five Guys.  It's cheaper and delicious.
