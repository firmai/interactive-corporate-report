I've eaten at Applebee's many times over the years.  There hasn't been anything memorable...nothing really good, nothing really bad.  Just so-so.  When counting calories, I did appreciate the Weight Watchers menu items.  There was a veggie pizza thing that wasn't on the menu, but had heard about from a friend.  It was quite good. Anyways, on this particular evening, I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  Out of all the places that I've had spinach artichoke dip, this one has to be the most bland tasting dip.  I was hungry, so ate almost all of it.  I never did get a refill on my iced tea.  I didn't get to the restaurant until 11:30pm, and the restaurant started closing at midnight.  Next time, given the option to go to Applebee's or stay home, I should play it safe and stay home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2?start=40,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

Well there are a few expectations that any patron should have for a sit down restaurant: 1. If you bother to hire a greeter, make sure they are someone who actually knows how to greet your patrons. Upon entering, the ""greeter"" was too busy watching the college football game to even notice my boyfriend and I, until our conversation alerted him to our presence. And then he stared at us as if he'd never seen queer people before. Granted, we are more rare in this area, but COME ON! 2. The food should be a touch above fast food quality, especially for the price. We ordered the appetizer sampler for $12.99, plus the french onion soup (the only real highlight of our dining experience, and even that I am told, by my more experienced french onion soup eating boyfriend, was mediocre). I found great irony when a taco bell commercial came on one of the many TV screens that their quesadillas taste so much better than those in our sampler.  The ONLY star worthy aspect of our experience was our server. She was friendly, down-to-earth, and very accommodating. If I was just rating her, she'd definitely get 4 stars.  So, please, save yourself the $$ and just walk next door to Taco Bell. You'll get much better food at a MUCH better price. .shakes head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2?start=60,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.6920000000000006,2.48

However, if you are looking for a simple get-together with friends with some inexpensive drinks and finger food on some game days, this place will do justice.  I got traditional wings (10 pieces for about 5 dollars or so?) and a fountain drink for about 8.50 total. I think that's a pretty good deal and was able to watch a Sunday Night Football game too. Wings were ok. Sauce was alright and the texture and meatiness of the wings were inconsistent. I would prefer Buffalo Wild Wings anytime.

I got one of the 550 calories or less shrimp dishes, and while the shrimp was just ok the rest of the dish was pretty flavorful.  This review would have been two or three stars had it not been for one thing: best. server. ever. Her name is Michaela, and she was super awesome. When I go to a restaurant I expect someone knowledgable and with personality, and Michaela had both in spades. She was very...chill I guess is the right adjective, but not so much so that it seemed like she didn't give a you-know-what. It was more just her feeling comfortable enough to be herself and joke around, and she was an incredibly attentive server towards all of the tables in her section. We told the manager how awesome she was on the way out, as I used to appreciate that as a server. Although let me clarify, we didn't pull the ol' verbal tip (compliment the server to their boss and think that means it's ok to leave a crappy tip) and neither should you.

Usually chain restaurants can get at least four stars from me, but there is really, utterly, nothing fantastic that has stood out to me since I've been coming here.  Service is mediocre at best, at times we're left a ""few minutes"" too long to look at the menu. I don't know what servers do if they don't actually serve me ANYTHING. Every time we've come, there is a new person bringing out anything for us. The server will take our orders and some other person will be running it out to us. A different person for drinks, a different person for appetizers, a different person for our meals. I don't know if this is normal but it's a pain in the ass. I can't find my server for anything because they don't bring me anything, and when I ask the person who brings me something, most of the time I can tell they sure as hell don't want to bring it to me. Or they drop something off and run away so fast I can't ask anyways. I don't feel really good about tipping highly because the server didn't actually do anything for me, all the people running their food did. I've wondered if I should hand each person giving me something a dollar instead of tipping...hmm... Food is decent, two for twenty all the time.

Not overly friendly, but provided great service, and cracked a smile or two throughout the night. We thought she was great. -The food* totally edible-- I'll dive in more in the cons... -wait time was probably about 5-10 minutes on a Thursday at dinner time, totally reasonable. -food arrived pretty fast after ordering, drinks were refilled when we wanted and plates cleared up not too long after finishing-- all great stuff! Cons: - the waiting area seats like 5 people maybe... And the couple sittings in the corner had family come in and all try to squeeze in.... Making it super awkward for us the couple standing because theirs no seats, and the other couple seated. Too close for comfort. -The table we sat at was clean, but the hairs had food on them. -the food pt II: I ordered medium on my steak, got well done-- definitely not a deal breaker cause it was still pretty good, BUT the menu and the real deal were night and day. Do not expect to get that beautiful meal in the menu.

8,Felicia N.,"Belltown, Seattle, WA",86,145,227.0,2.0,2016-07-13,"Went out for dinner with the family on a Tuesday night here, which is kid's night woohoo! My little brothers ate off the kids menu for less than $2 each. One of them ordered the grilled cheese and barely touched it. He loves grilled cheeses but there was something off about this one... Dad and I did the 2 for $25 deal that comes with an appetizer to share and two entrees. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and dad got the Baby Back Ribs in Chipotle sauce with grilled veggies and garlic green beans on the side. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and were disappointed. We liked the salsa that came out with the chips better than the dip itself, hah.  The Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp was WAY TOO GREASY. It came with a pat of herb butter on the chicken that I removed immediately, but the entire dish was drenched in oil still. The sauteed onions and mushrooms were overcooked on the sizzling pan and were lost to the grease. The portion size was great, the shrimp was cooked well, but the chicken was a little dry (maybe that's what all the grease is for...). The dish came with a side of fried potatoes. Yay, more grease. Can you tell that the excessive fat ruined the dish for me? Dad's dish was delicious. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs and the grilled veggies were clean and fresh. The garlic green beans were greasy also, but mixed with the grilled veggies it wasn't too bad. Overall, good bang for your buck but beware of the fat content in the food that you're getting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

Ok, cool.  Then, because it was my brothers birthday, he got what was supposed to be a free desert which we requested in a to-go container so he could eat it later.  Then we got the bill and found out that the waitress charged us for the drink and for the free Birthday dessert because we requested it to-go.  The argument was not worth the $5 savings.  It probably goes without saying but my $10 tip on a $35 bill was reduced to a $5 tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

He waited about 5 mins to come over and take our drink order for us. He checked back a few mins later to take our order an seemed rushed and impatient for us to make up our minds on what we wanted. It was happy hour and he did not point out the happy hour menu until after we ordered drinks, which may have changed our drink order than for something cheaper. Usually when I go at happy hour they come over to introduce themselves and than would remind about happy hour and the menu that pointed out which items were cheaper.

There was hardly anything I could eat or was interested in eating. I have high lactose intolerance, and my food without cheese was extremely limited and extremly bland. Many choices were fried, fattening, high calorie, and all around bad for you.  The place had TVs everywhere, which I understand people like their sports, but there were too many and it was overwhelming. Then with the screens on the tables and people on cells phones, just too much!

I have only now checked Yelp reviews for this place after the fact and am pretty shocked at other's experiences. Then again, I am not too picky and I ask for very little: good tasting food and decent customer service.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon after seeing how packed Sweet Tomatoes was. Applebees wasnt too busy and the nice hostess actually opened the door for us. We were quickly seated at a booth by the window. We had Brandon as our server and he was excellent! He had a nice attitude, didnt rush us to order, didnt check on us too much (I hate when waiters do that), and never left us with an empty glass.  I got the shrimp and parmesan top sirloin steak with steamed broccoli and garlic green beans. It was sooo good! The steak was tender and cooked the way I wanted (medium). My husband got the ee brisket tacos and fries which he said was delicious, and my daughter had the mac n cheese which she enjoyed as well.

9,Lora R.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,69,22.0,1.0,2017-09-29,"Visiting from Arizona. Came here with my mom, Aunt, daughter & daughter's friend. Sever asked if we wanted seperate checks, my daughter said that her and friend were on same check & I said the remaining 3 would be on the other check. (This will be important towards the end of this post.) On to the food. My Aunt just wanted a salad & baked potatoe, loaded. Server explains that its $2 upcharge to have it loaded - Aunt says ok but asks if loaded meant bacon, sour cream, cheese & chives to which server replied ""yes"". Mom orders ""butcher meat & potatoes"" entree which is supposed to have mashed potatoes but she requests a loaded baked potatoe instead, knowing the same $2 upcharge will apply (we didn't know until we got the check that they also charge ANOTHER $2 to sub the bake for the mash). These baked potatoes were poorly ""loaded"" (and didn't have chives) & were cold. Mom's butcher meat was however plentifully loaded with gristle. I ordered the burbon chicken & shrimp which was way overcooked & chicken was inedible - at that point I asked for something else (Lemon pepper chicken mac m cheese - was mediocre at best - the dog didn't even like it - however she did like the butcher meat). So we basically had expensive dog food with awful service. She didn't even check back at appropriate intervals to make sure everything was ok. I had to get up & go to the bar to request condiment. The girl brings the checks (we're supposed to have 2). My daughter is paying for her & friend & I'm paying for the rest of us as we stated when she asked in the first place. We pay cash because the way she's explaining to how to pay with cards sounds like we need a tech degree on their table machine. I'm sure its not that serious but she was a mess explaining. So while we're getting our cash together the server is standing there hovering over us like we're trying to dine n dash or something. I was kind of stuck where I was seated, but as I was able to get out I dropped the cash on the table in front of her & she gave me a snide ""thaaaaaannnnnks"".  Then our little group is standing outside chatting before parting ways & out comes our server in a very accusatory manner saying that we didn't pay for one of the guests & was very rude about it. Finally (to make a long story short) it gets figured out that she split the check 3 ways instead of 2. The friend didn't notice & neither did the rest of us because we were only thinking about 2 checks! So the friend pays her for the missing meal, but wow this girl was so unprofessional. Definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2,2.32,2.91,2.91,,2.6740000000000004
