6,My D.,"Burnsville, MN",410,48,1212.0,5.0,2017-10-18,"Yes it was the Grand Opening on Tuesday October 17. Busy but the smiles and service was very welcomed. Was greeted by so many individuals ready to get us seated and help us through their huge menu. Ranging from salads, Italian, Asian, some Tex mex, breakfast all day selections and America food. I can't forgot all the Cheesecake selections. They also have ice cream and cake.             We had the pleasure of enjoying the white chocolate Raspberry truffle cheesecake!! One of my favorites and my brothers new favorite. Nothing was forgotten while we dined for the very busy lunch hour. We ordered the avocado toast, pizza and salad lunch special and the super antioxidants salad. Not to forget the avocado egg rolls and the firecracker salmon rolls! Yummy. The food presentation was up to Cheesecake Factory standards!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
7,Rachel B.,"Minneapolis, MN",59,126,89.0,4.0,2017-10-20,"Hooray!  There's a new Cheesecake Factory in town!  I'm not much a chain restaurant fan, but Cheesecake Factory is a unique experience.  If you order right, you can get well-prepared, high quality food for considerably less than you would at a fancy schmancy downtown restaurant. This time I had the seared tuna entrée, which was to die for.  It came with outstanding tuna, fresh veggies, and some delicious sauce with a serious wasabi kick, and I think it was only $22 and enough for two people to share.   I've only been to this new location once, but they seemed to be bending over backwards to be friendly and give good customer service.  That said, service was kind of a jumbled mess, but I recognize that I was there on Day Two. Protip:  Share. The huge portions of rich, rich food here are almost a satire of American gluttony. So unless you are a growing teenage boy or you just ran a marathon, share. And get the cheesecake to go (but by all means, get the cheesecake).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
9,Derek J.,"Plymouth, MN",0,11,,5.0,2017-10-22,"This location just opened this week.  My wife and I wanted to check it out.  We were happy because this locale is only 10 mins away.   We arrived and had no wait for a table.  This was a first at CF.  The decor is very nice and clean.   We were promptly greeted by our waitress who took our drink order and arrived soon after with our drinks.  We were also given a basket of warm bread and a refill as well.  We decided to try the Fortella with Roasted Chicken and Garlic.  It was excellent.  We were checked on several times and given refills or asked multiple times.   We also got the raspberry lemon cheesecake to go.  Which was soooo good.   Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Service was phenomenal and the food was top notch.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
14,Piyali B.,"Plymouth, MN",0,7,2.0,5.0,2017-10-25,Too many choices!  Easy pick for when the family can't decide on a cuisine.  Wonderful staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
2,Lily M.,"Minneapolis, MN",49,4,8.0,3.0,2017-10-25,"Service was alright. I feel like our waitress was new to the food industry, she seemed nervous but kind.  Our food took awhile to get to us, but when we got it, my mothers steak was really raw and cold. Our server didn't even give my family members a steak knife, she hurried off after the food was dropped off. On the other hand, I ordered salmon with some lemon sauce. It was really good, I'd recommend it.  Overall, it wasn't the best experience. I'd recommend it to someone who is nearby, but not to someone that's got out of their way to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
13,Marianne H.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",1,2,,1.0,2017-11-11,"What a terrible disappointment. This location doesn't meet the usual Cheesecake Factory standards at all. We were told it would be a half hour wait to be seated and an hour and fifteen minutes later we finally got a table. Then 2 of the 8 orders were wrong, one of the corrections took 30 minutes and the rest of us were nearly finished with our meals by the time it got there. We were celebrating a birthday so we ordered cheesecake which was almost correct but the guy who got his meal late never got his cheesecake. The entire time we were seated we had to ask for refills on our drinks. This was not a good experience and I'm not sure I will ever be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
12,Laura H.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,5,,2.0,2017-11-18,"We were excited to add this to the restaurant options at Ridgedale, but the excitement didn't last long. The food took forever - and the entrees came out 25 minutes apart (there were only three of us). My order was messed up and had to ask the waiter to take things off the bill that were never delivered. It's a shame because the food was decent, but service was terrible. Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
16,Abby E.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,5,,3.0,2017-11-21,"After being seated and our drink orders were taken by a vary awkward waitress I began to look at food choices. After flipping through a extensive menu I chose the Americano burger and my mother chose the club. We had a basket of bread with our drinks while waiting for our food to come, our food came our quite quickly and our server than popped up asked us how everything looked before we managed to take a bite and than disappeared. That's when things went wrong, I cut my burger in half to see that it wasn't medium as I had ordered but rare. So rare that it was still cold, my waitress than was no where around and I had to flag down another waitress who saw it and was shocked that it was even sent out. She got me a salad on the house, and they fixed my burger, the manager also came and apologized. When it was time to get the bill they took the burger off it completely. I was impressed at the lengths they went to make everything right. I believe that they are still trying to work out everything since it is still semi new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
4,Linda L.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,73,122.0,4.0,2017-11-24,Enjoying Black Friday dinner with love ones!  Glad to know thy open a new location in Minnetonka which is more convenient now!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
8,Somnath G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,2.0,4.0,2017-11-26,Place looks great. Not uncommon for Cheesecake Factory. We ordered factory nachos and soft corn tacos. Factory nachos is gigantic in portion but overwhelmingly delicious. Soft corn tacos I would say was just good. Only issue we faced was getting the table when it was our turn to get a table the concerned person gave our table to someone else which was bit weird. Looks like they need some training. Our waitress was wonderful and comforting. Would definitely recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
5,Abigail B.,"St. Michael, MN",12,18,27.0,5.0,2017-12-02,"Came for lunch to celebrate my birthday. We've always loved the apps when we went to Southdale. Food was good as always--potato bites, fried mac and cheese, calamari, and the wonton wrapped chicken (can't remember the name!) The free bread was warm and good, too.  Our server, Marty, made the experience great. We've never gone to the restaurant because of their servers' reputation before, but maybe now we will!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
11,M. H.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,126,38.0,5.0,2017-12-03,"This location is 10 times better than the Southdale location. Everyone is friendly, they actually smile and say hello/thank you. The ambience is very warm and inviting, and the food quality is so much better here. Everything was delicious and timed out well. Our server, Matt, was fabulous, knowledgeable, very kind and hard working. We'll be going to this location from now on as it was a much more enjoyable experience all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
0,Alex L.,"Minneapolis, MN",47,58,43.0,4.0,2017-12-06,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory.  Let's set aside the fact that it is a soulless chain.   I got a side salad.  It's a side salad.  Nothing to comment on.   But the truffle bacon grilled cheese!  Look at those perfectly browned craggy edges of crispy goodness!  Sturdy ciabatta bread wrapped around salty strips of bacon that, strangely, cut through the fattiness of the cheese.  And it comes with a little saucer of tomato soup dip.  Because you have to have grilled cheese with tomato soup.  There is no truffle flavor whatsoever, which is a good thing, because who wants fake truffle oil all over their homey  grilled cheese? So based on my single visit and this one item, 3.5 stars.  I did not get the cheesecake.  Because it's a Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
10,Amanda R.,"Hopkins, MN",133,22,1.0,5.0,2017-12-13,"Tonight I had the BBQ Burger with fries and it was really good. The burger was juicy and a good size, better than most places. It filled me up and I sadly had no room for cheesecake but there is always next time. I will definitely go back soon within the next few weeks. The environment was good and the staff was very nice. I had a great dining experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
15,Denise M.,"Wayzata, MN",0,3,1.0,4.0,2017-12-19,"I can always count on the Cheesecake Factory to have consistently good food from location to location.  I've been to these restaurants around the country.  I love that there is a wide selection of menu options, it's great for the family because they have something for everyone.  I do like the Edina location better because the booths are more private and I feel like people aren't staring at you.  (Probably just a rude customer)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
1,Ntxhi Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",73,2,4.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"Ordered. 30 mins later, no bread and no apps. Finally got apps and had everything else to go because they already took way too long. They forgot the cheesecake in the to-go bag, which was the main point of going there  #slow #smh I also got a piece of metal in my pasta to go. ‍",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
3,Nick M.,"Minnetonka, MN",6,1,,4.0,2018-01-10,My wife and I had lunch at the Minnetonka Cheesecake Factory today and totally enjoyed the experience.  The luncheon fish & chips had more than ample portions of fish and chips coupled with flavorful Cole  Slaw.  My wife reported her chicken salad sandwich was equally delicious.  Topping off this excellent dining experience was our Server Jordan's constant smile and eagerness to please.  All in all a 5-Star luncheon in very pleasant environment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-minnetonka,,,,,
