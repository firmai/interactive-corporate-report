After hearing that, I assumed I didn't get the job but at the end of the third day, The EKM called and offered me the job.

I interviewed at Cheesecake Factory (Willow Grove, PA) in May 2015.']","['The application required a personality test and a speed test which included SAT-type questions. I sent in the application and got a call from a manager about 4-5 days later. I was looking for a second part-time summer job and their posting said seasonal and summer so I thought it would be perfect for me. Anyway, I drove a half hour for my interview to talk to a manager for 5 minutes who asked me only two questions. Don\'t get me wrong, he was very friendly, but the interview was rushed and you could tell he either already had someone else in mind to hire or just was not interested in hiring me. Everything he said had a negative connotation such as ""Oh so you don\'t have any upscale casual dining experience"" and ""We usually don\'t hire only for the summer"" and ""We\'re interviewing 40-50 applicants for 4-5 positions"". Everything he said made me realize he was not interested. I wish they would have just called me and told me they were not interested because it was blatantly obvious. It would have saved me a half an hour up and back to get there and all the time I spent researching the company. It was very disappointing.']","[' Tell me about yourself... what are your goals for the future? \xa0 ', '1 Answer']"
