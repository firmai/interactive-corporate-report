Or they are so bland plain they are boring (I had a blacked chicken sandwich that has a few shakes of blackening on it).   It pleases the step son and is great for families, but it isn't a place we go unless we have kids with us.  It just lacks.  Service is slow.  Food is boring.  Prices are fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2?start=20,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

They do have amazing, bottomless steak fries and ranch dipping sauce, but they're always real skimpy when you ask for a basket and with 3 people it doesn't last very long. And ""bottomless"" only works when your server comes by periodically. Which ours didn't. Someone - not our server - came by and finally took our drink order and maybe 15 minutes after we were seated our waitress finally came over. She took our order and we didn't see her at all for another 15-20 minutes. She kept disappearing somewhere in the back and appeared to not be helping out anybody. The burgers here are ho-hum if you get them without all the extra toppings they like to slather on, which is the way I like them. The meat is mostly flavorless without any extra pizzazz.

The dining room looks as if they were going for some garish cat house looking theme with bright red chairs and black tables. If you want to see the cool pictures they had hanging you now have to look on the ceiling. The family atmosphere when you walked in the door is now a look of a not well decorated pub. The family part is completely gone. My husband and one of my granddaughters felt sick after eating their food. I felt sick by the completely mismatched themes and the family restaurant gone wild appearances. The first table we were seated at wobbled so badly my granddaughter almost fell.

When I was visiting relatives in Parker, they wanted to hit the bar and grab some food. This is how I found myself at a Red Robin for the first time in 8 years. Remembering how the meat used to make me gag, I opted for a grilled chicken sandwich. Imagine my delight when the kitchen had no problems wrapping it in lettuce instead of a bun and then they offered -- here's the kicker -- a side salad, cole slaw or fresh broccoli instead of fries....and ALL WERE UNLIMITED! Yes! All you can eat salad, cole slaw or broccoli if you don't want french fries! I'm in love!  The food was just ""meh."" Acceptable but nothing to write home about.

31,Madison A.,"Parker, CO",113,55,18.0,3.0,2015-06-19,"I love Red Robin. Love love love. However, today my experience was terrible. I've been to this Red Robin many times before over the years, and I've only had a few bad experiences, mostly positive.  We came in today around 3 PM and we had to wait like 5 minutes to be seated. As then it took a while to take our order. And then the food took forever to come out, etc. There weren't even that many people in the restaurant. They really needed some more staff. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O Salad as I usually do.  Today I had one of the biggest shocks ever. The salad came out on a square plate, a quarter the size it used to be. The portion was ridiculously small. I was honestly so surprised. The price was the same, the salad was very small. I loved red robin because of the fact that the salads were bigger portions. It's extremely disappointing when one of your favorite restaurants makes a menu change that only benefits the company. I asked the waitress and she said it was something cooperate.  I don't really know how to feel about Red Robin anymore. I came in last week and I had the full portion salad, and now it's gone. Just like that.  The food quality is amazing, but I can't believe Red Robin is trying to skimp out on their salads.

The buns  both become   bit  soggy  a light toasting  might have helped.  Service was consistently slow.  We asked for an order  of fries to have before  our meal but the fries took so long we got the fries 10 seconds before our food arrived.  The fries  arrived hot and fresh.  But the fries with the burgers were not  really hot and fresh.   The burgers were warm but not hot it seemed as though our food sat around for a while and the fries even longer.  The burger themselves  were  ok but seemed small for an 8 oz burger.  Service was slow I had to wait quite a while  just for a tea refill.  We ordered  dessert the brownie  and lemonade  cake.  Both just needed to be plated.  It took more than 10 minutes to get the dessert.  The brownie  sticks were described as light but they were very old and heavy.  I Would Not Suggest Getting This Dessert unless you have a lot of vanilla  Ice cream.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.54,2.84

I ate at the Parker, CO location last week and my chicken sandwich was good, but what has happened to the steak fries? They used to be about an inch wide, thick, and very good! Now it seems they are using a cheaper product and many of the fries were from the edge of the potato. They aren't any good anymore and in my opinion, that's what set them apart from other burger joints.  I think, if they're looking to cut cost, ditch the bottomless fries and return to the product that they used in the past!!

Usually, the team here will sit you in a cleaner area if some madness went down, but it kind of comes with the territory of burb life.

1,Craig P.,"Denver, CO",1,360,617.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"I rarely give 1-Star rating. This experience, however, deserves the mark. We frequent and enjoy Red Robin. Their burgers are typically good and we love the fries. During this particular visit it all fell apart. First, I currently have some strict dietary restrictions. As it has it, RR has the Wedgie Burger which doesn't have gluten, egg, or dairy. Or at least it isn't suppose to have any of those things. So I ordered it and it came with a huge glob of mayonnaise. Instead of the server taking it back she argued with me that it is supposed to come with mayo. After much debate she gave me the, ""fine, I'll go ask my manager"" speech. She then came back 8 minutes later (my family was already done eating) and said, ""I guess you were right, it isn't supposed to have mayo. What would you like me to do about it?"" So that didn't make things feel very apologetic or accommodating. So I asked for a newly made Wedgie Burger. She went back and put the order in meanwhile my family was done eating. While I was waiting for the new Wedgie Burger to come to the table the same server spilled a tray of 8 drinks all over the people sitting at the table next to us. She basically freaked out and left the scene. She came back a couple minutes later with a handful of napkins and started helping to clean up people shirts, shoes, and the table. After a minor attempt to clean up she left. 12 minutes later my burger came with no acknowledgment of the mix up. Meanwhile, the family next to us got up and left the restaurant. When they left three employees and the manager moved the tables around while splashing through the 1/2 inch of soda, tea, and water on the ground. No one ever cleaned up the floor or put a sign out. People with their kids where slipping and sliding all over the floor trying to get to the bathroom and back. It was a total mess and a very UNSAFE situation. The restaurant wasn't even all that busy. It just came down to non-caring and inept staff and management. Honestly, they are lucky that no one fell or that I didn't break out into an allergic reaction. Overall it was a VERY stressful and unacceptable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

2,Amanda W.,"Elizabeth, CO",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-13,"My family and I ate at this restaurant in early January.  Our credit card was charged twice. Upon realizing this, my husband called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager and he was put on hold for thirty minutes. My husband called back a couple days later and spoke with a manager by the name of Steve. Steve said he would do some research and call back later that day. Steve called backed not the same day but two days later and told my husband there was no evidence of this double transaction. My husband printed off the statement from our credit card showing clearly that the card was charged the exact amount on the same day at the same time two times. He took this to the restaurant where he was told in a very condescending manner that there was nothing that could be done. Will not dine at this establishment ever again. I never write reviews but this was ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
