Gloria N.,"Silver Spring, MD",20,27,13,2.0,12/29/2015,"I've come to CPK so many times before but this time was honestly one of the worse experiences I've had here.  Got here and had to wait 20 min for a table when there are clearly open tables. Also, while waiting, there was a party of 3 that came in asking if they had a table and they were seated right away. Ummm...what!? I'm here waiting for a table for 3 and yet another party that came in after me gets seated before me?  Our server was super nice though. Tried to add some humor to us ordering. Food quality makes up for the table arrangement but not by much. Definitely makes me wonder if I want to come back or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=20
Aria C.,"North Potomac, MD",19,21,118,3.0,7/6/2016,"The service was perfectly fine and the Spinach Artichoke Dip was satisfactory. The California Club Pizza was, however, very disappointing to my surprise (I had the California Club Sandwich years ago and remember that was quite delicious). Simply picking up a single slice of pizza resulted in all of the toppings falling off and having to eat just pizza dough with unfavorable sauce. The pizza was overall bland and unappetizing. Other members in my group enjoyed their pizza so I'll perhaps give other flavors a chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=20

Irene A.,"Germantown, MD",31,36,1,2.0,12/4/2016,"Worst pizza I've had in a very long time.  I ordered the Tostada Pizza, which is supposed to have beans, cheese, salad, etc.  It had... let me count... fewer than 10 individual beans across the entire pizza and barely any cheese.  I basically had bread and iceberg lettuce for dinner.  I went in wanting to see the dessert menu, but left without asking for it because with the quality of the pizza, I thought I'd be disappointed in dessert.  They get 2 stars instead of 1 only because my husband liked his pasta dish.  That said, they do call themselves California PIZZA Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=20

Annamaria B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",29,36,1,2.0,4/20/2016,"I usually love this CPK, I live in Gaithersburg and the one at the Rio is closer but I always have issues there. I have never had issues here until last Sunday. We were seated almost immediately but it took a while for our server to come by and take our drink order. We got our  drinks and placed our order a short time later. Our waiter did not come back by to check on us we had to ask for water once our drinks had been empty for a while. I had to flag him down to get a dessert menu and again flag him down for the check. He never asked me for my Pizza Dough number and the bill was huge compared to what it normally is. I love going to CPK but I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon. I was very disappointed in the service we received. To top it off I checked my bank account and it looks like they ran my card twice! That just really ticks me off. If I do go back to this location it will be only because of Wayne, he was not our server this time but I did see him and say hi.

Even though it tasted good I discovered that it had one thin slice of turkey covered with vegetables and lots of bacon. For what they charge for this sandwich I would expect to find a few slices of turkey. Told my server about the lack of meat and he said something about changes in food preparation. Remaining half of sandwich was replaced with another that had plenty turkey in it. My wife's Club with chicken was also quite lacking.

Our waitress was nice and attentive.  Her service was admirable and quick.  However, the gentleman that sat me must have thought it was funny to put me and my friend at the area where there are steps... I had a tough time getting up the two steps while in a crutch (sprained ankle, bruised leg, numb thigh, etc...).  I managed though. It was tough getting out with the tables so close together though.  Not sure if it is or not it may or may not be ADA compliant.

Pizza was overcooked, the cheese on the pizza looked like it had been through the microwave 5 times over (bubbly and hard). Salads were good. But every single person was disappointed in their food. I've been to CPK before, and this is the worst one. If you are thinking of going here, go to Cheesecake Factory instead.

She told Betty (the bartender) who then said ""I know."" Senait then tried to downplay my degree, told me it was hard for black people to find jobs, complained about other customers to me, and tried to boast about having a car, a job, paying her own bills, having an apartment, taking care of her kid, etc. Which btw, is very common and nothing to really boast about Senait.

I was super exited to try the Korean BBQ Steak tacos, but when they weren't on the menu I explained to the waitress that I saw them online and whether I could order it (as an entree). She came back to the table at least twice just to clarify what I wanted . This should have been my first sign... I asked her each time whether it was okay to order this and when she said it wouldn't be a problem, I was all ""Great!""   When the food arrived, BP's mom had a gorgeous salad, BP, had a scrumptious artichoke and chicken pizza and I got an appetizer.... The Korean BBQ Steak Tacos were an appetizer...  First I was very disappointed, but as many know, my eyes are bigger then my stomach and the food was a perfect portion! BP offered me a pizza slice and I even though I was feeling stuffed, I really enjoyed it. There was an ample amount of chicken and the artichoke pieces were flavorful. -1 Star because the service was super slow for a Tuesday (early evening).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=20

I ordered a simple Cesar salad w/added salmon. We were in a hurry to grab a working lunch, so, we ordered ahead. When we went to pick it up, we still had to wait forever and it was not at all the same experience as you get dining in. The salad was a bit wilty and pre-packed. The salmon was so dry and portion was soooo small (for a $5 add on)! I couldn't even identify those nuggets as salmon when I opened the package! They also forgot my requested bread and utensils from the bag. Talk about disappointing!  If only I'd eaten at the restaurant, I'd have complained and I'm sure I woulda gotten a substitution item and left reasonably happy.

Jane O.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,3,,2.0,1/30/2016,"Although the food may be good, my boyfriend and I did not have a very pleasant experience with who seems to be the manager of this place. I ordered the strawberry mango cooler as my drink.  I had maybe 5-6sips of it, and it was all gone due to the cup being 2/3 filled with ice. When the waitress came over, I asked if the drink has a 'refill policy' because the cup was over filled with ice. She kindly told me that she'll get me a new drink even though it does not have a refill policy, so I thanked her. Then, a lady who seems to be the manager rudely came over to our table, didn't introduce herself and just blurted out, ""you can't get refills for that drink."" I told her that I never asked for a refill. I told her that the waitress kindly offered. She then said okay, but she again explained that I could not get a refill.

Lisa S.,"Silver Spring, MD",181,564,653,2.0,7/5/2014,"I had been craving CPK's pear and gorgonzola pizza (one of my all-time favorite pizzas) for weeks before I finally caved and ordered it through GrubHub (which I think was actually fulfilled through Takeout Taxi). The delivery fee was massive but I decided to treat myself. Food took awhile to arrive, but it was within the expected delivery window, so I technically can't complain about that :-). The delivery guy was older and super nice, and I sincerely hope he got the tip I entered on my credit card through Grubhub- the fact that it had to go through two companies to get to him made me a bit suspicious, and makes me think I should tip in cash in the future. Grubhub wouldn't let me select what crust we wanted for our pear and gorgonzola pizzas, so I rolled with it and left it up to fate. The crust ended up being thin crust, which I wasn't happy about (I don't like thin crust, generally). When I went to eat my pizza, one of the first things I noticed was that the crust:topping ratio was off (note: no thin crust ever again please!). The second thing I noticed was that the crust was soft, especially on the bottom, and everything on the pizza tasted slightly underdone and chewy. But simultaneously, the edges of the pizza were so crispy that if I accidentally pushed on them too hard, they broke off the slices and into little pieces. However, a few minutes in the oven at 350-400 heated the pizza up and finished cooking it. The pizza normally comes with a dressed salad on top, which they packed on the side. The salad was as I remembered, but something tasted a little off- wasn't sure if it was the dressing or slightly old and wilted lettuce (both seemed a bit off, but not sure where the taste was coming from).  The meal definitely cured my craving, but I'm not sure in the most ideal way... the meal was pretty disappointing. I suppose I'll go to this CPK in person next time the craving hits and see if it's any better than what I got delivered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=40
Mary Y.,"Corona, CA",148,560,365,4.0,4/15/2011,"CPK is my all-time favorite chain restaurant. I don't know why but it's just so delicious. I haven't been able to try everything on the menu because there's are soo many options.  Obviously they have a wide variety of pizza options. I love the Thai, BBQ, BLT and California pizza. They offer a healthier honey wheat crust. If you decide to be adventurous and select a pizza and don't like it, you can turn it back and get your normal item. This location was inside the mall and had a fairly long wait considering I arrived close to 2pm (after the lunch rush) But, I was with a friend catching up so it didn't bother me. If I was however on a lunch break from work, the wait would have been a big issue. That's why I'm giving it a 4 star review. But in general I rate CPK's menu 5 stars!! The staff was very attentive during my stay. But I've rarely had a bad server experience at any of the CPK's I've been too. I love that they name tag of the servers show their ""hometown""/country.  They've added new appetizers but my go-to is usually the spinach dip or the avocado rolls. My favorite salad is the Oriental, BBQ Chicken or the new Miso. But the Tricolore Salad is my #1 dining option.  Did i tell you I love the cocktails here too? They have great flavored mojito selection, although I wish it came in a bigger glass since I'm paying $6-7. They have great desserts too but rarely have room for it. Don't forget the offer bread and butter which I always love but try to stay away from since I don't want to fill myself with too many carbs.

If you plan to eat here, make a reservation as soon as you arrive at the mall or before you leave home.  Our service was fine, however, we felt incredibly rushed the entire meal.  Also, CPK is one of the places in the mall that Build-a-Bear Workshop downstairs recommends for birthday parties to eat afterwards. I have never been in here when there wasn't at least one party from downstairs up here. I like kids as much as the next person. However when parents are ignoring their kids running around the table and bumping wait staff and being incredibly annoying, I have an issue. (For the record, if you won't tell your brat to sit down, don't looked shocked when someone else does. It's a resturant not a playground - that is downstairs in the Sears wing).

The fish tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the margarita pizza is amazzzinngggg. I also think their salads are some of the best around. Their pasta is alright, I would mostly recommend the appetizers, pizza and salads. The BBQ salad and pizza are both very good. Also cannot go wrong with their chocolate soufflee....mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!  There is a lot and it is in the mall which makes a wait a little more convenient, although i am pretty sure they take reservations. The wait is usually very long, however this is one of the few restaurants where the food travels very well. Therefore it would even be worth it to just order in.

Mr. S.,"Rockville, MD",2,18,,1.0,7/27/2010,"To say my latest experience here was bad would be an understatement. It has been a while since I was treated this RUDELY at any establishment.  Almost immediately upon being seated a clumsy waitress spilled a glass of red wine all over our table. Now, I understand that mistakes do happen, and I am not faulting the waitress here, but the fact that we were not reseated was surprising. Not two minutes after she was done ""wiping up"", the moron in a manger's uniform comes to us and requests that we shut the (already open) blinds at the window next to our table as the light is bothering another table. Um... Close them yourself? Isn't this your restaurant?Why were they open in the first place?  Closing the blinds severely darkened our table and we asked if we could be reseated someplace with a window (that could, you know, actually be used for the light it was built to show) - which, while it did happen, seemed as though we were asking him for his first born. Now the new table: the waiter was HORRENDOUS. How he is employed is beyond me. We waited over 10 minutes for an appearance (which never happened) at which point someone in our party went to complain and request some service. The moron-manager then reappeared (lucky us!) to take our order as his protege was ""overwhelmed by 3 tables"". The orders came after a half-assed apology from the server, and surprise! One item was wrong and another was nonexistent. After the missing item was brought (we thought it best to count our blessings and just keep the wrong item) we were informed that ""dessert is on the house"" which ended up being one lonely sad little kid-sized sundae. Oh, I forgot to mention the ""how's everything going?"" that was asked as the waiter whisked by not even waiting for a response (seriously, why even ask?). Ordering dessert: moron-waiter popped up, asked the 1st person in our party what they would like: Brownie sundae. Him: ""Great!"" and immediately walked away! Walked AWAY. The rest of our party was seething and needed some calming down. So much for the free dessert. And the cherry on top this disastrous sundae of a dining experience? The BROWNIE sundae had no brownie.

Adam F.,"Rockville, MD",57,24,,1.0,9/4/2011,"Can you say HORRENDOUS?  What follows is the actual email I just sent to the divisional manager in charge of this location with the names deleted for privacy: Ms. _________, I was told that you are the divisional manager who oversees the Montgomery Mall California Pizza Kitchen location.  I'm writing to describe the miserable service and food we experienced at that location this evening (Sunday September 4, 2011).  I have dined here and at other CPK locations in the past and am amazed at how badly the service and quality has declined. My party consisted of 3 adults, one small child, and one toddler.  According to the check, we sat at table 75/1 and our server was ______.  _______ took our drink and food order at the same time as there were two children with us.  We asked for some bread as well.  After about 7 minutes, our drinks arrived.  The 2 iced teas we ordered were warm, so we asked for some extra ice.  Since the bread did not come with the drinks, we asked for bread again.  Please note that a well trained server should know that a table with 2 small children should receive bread or something for the kids to munch on.  After a few more minutes (perhaps 4 or so) another member of the staff brought over 2 glasses filled with the ice we requested, but still no bread.  We asked for the bread yet again, and some cold bread arrived in a couple of minutes (brought by a staff member other than _________) without any butter.  At this point we should have expected the worst which was still yet to come. Our pizzas arrived a few minutes later.  Two of the three were ice cold (a Hawaiian pizza and a Margherita pizza), and one was warm (a Traditional with chicken pieces).  We gave the two cold pizzas back to _________.  While we waited for our food to arrive warm, no one came to see if we needed more to drink nor did anyone come to clear used plates, etc. from our table.  Little kids make messes.  We cleaned the table ourselves and placed the soiled plates and used napkins on the shelf next to our table.  When our pizzas arrived a few minutes later, they were warm but obviously the same ones that had previously been served to us cold.  I took one bite out of the Margherita pizza and almost spit it out.  To say it was horrendous does not do enough to describe how terrible it was.  There was absolutely no taste to it at all, the cheese had a greasy sickly look to it and the basil was curled up which is what happens when you try to reheat a pizza.  I'd think that a restaurant like yours that specializes in pizza would know better!  Obviously not.  To make matters worse, our waiter _______ never came back to see how things were or to see if we needed drinks.  By this time my iced tea was empty and I wanted to get the horrid taste of the pizza out of my mouth. A few minutes more passed by and we were able to flag _________ down.  I told him to take my pizza away and I asked to see the manager.  The pizza was removed and about 5 minutes later _________ came over.  I gave _________ a narrative of our experience, emphasizing the atrocious service, and he was very nice and apologetic.  He cleaned the dirty plates that we had left on the shelf (note that _________ NEVER did this) and offered to make me a new pizza which I declined.  _________ asked what he could do and I said just take care of this mess with the check.  ________ comped our meal which was appreciated and unfortunately the only thing he could do as I didn't want to eat a thing there.  I did ask for some more iced tea as I STILL had not received any and was thirsty.  We waited about 5 minutes more and even _________ couldn't manage to bring over some tea.  Very disappointing that the General Manager himself couldn't carry out such a simple task! To say that I am appalled with your Montgomery Mall location is an understatement, and I will be sharing my experience with all who read Yelp, Urban Spoon, and Ness.  I look forward to a response from you regarding what will be done to ensure that this CPK location turns things around.   Thank you in advance for your reply,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=80

First off, don't tell me the wait is 15-25 minutes if the actual ait is 45-60 minutes. 15-25 minutes would have been fine waiting with my 2 small kids, but after almost an hour, the whole family was frazzled and annoyed. I had the signature BBQ chicken pizza and was extremely disappointed. The crust was very doughy and undercooked. My young son had the honey-chicken pizza and that was not bad for what it was.

Tara O.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,5,,1.0,8/21/2013,"I ate at this location yesterday with my two kids, and it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. We ordered a pizza that was a special, and asked for no cow dairy and no meat. We also ordered a pizza off the menu. The server clearly didn't know what was on the pizza, but I figured our instructions were sufficiently clear. She came back with a pizza with MAYONNAISE and CHICKEN all over it (after a thirty minute wait). She then went to talk to the kitchen and came back informing me that every item made by the restaurant contained cow dairy, including pasta and pizza crust. Bogus. After I expressed disbelief and asked for a box for the remaining half pizza that we had ordered without alterations, she went back to the kitchen to confer with the staff. Meanwhile, I took my kids to the bathroom. When I came out, our table had been moved and another family was sitting there. The server came up to me, handed me a bag with plain pasta in it and a check for $30 including tip. She acted surprised that our table had been cleared and suggested that we stay for another fifteen minutes so that they could make us another pizza, since they had thrown our leftovers away. This, after one child had not been fed, and the both had been sitting in the restaurant for 1:45. No offer to reduce the bill.

Fenny L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",731,1062,490,2.0,1/25/2010,"Oh CPK...whatever happened to you?  Have you always been this lame, and I was merely blinded by your new and different specialty gourmet pizzas?  Or have you slid downhill since I last dined here...over 5 years ago?  Either way, I mourn the CPK that I had pictured in my mind.  The CPK that slung out hot and delicious pizzas, and the service was fast and furious. It was the Saturday right before the Xmas holidays and my husband makes me break my self-imposed ban on entering any mall between Thanksgiving and New Years with the bribe of having a nice delicious lunch at CPK!  CPK? my eager and rapacious belly cried, why we haven't eaten their delicious Thai pizza in years upon years!  As we all know that I'm ruled by my stomach, I let my husband bring me to the mall. Heh, well my husband now knows why I have my self imposed ban...and my belly has learned a valuable lesson in listening to the brain sometimes. We arrive and was given a 25 minute wait.  As it as around 1pm, we expected a wait, so this wasn't a big deal.  However, a few minutes before we were seated, a party of 30 (yes, 30!), came in.  Now, a party of 30 wouldn't bother me...except that 20 of the 30 were kids.  All around the age of 5.  For a kid's birthday party.  REALLY?!?!  *REALLY?!?!?  CPK for a 5 year old's birthday party?!?  Have the parents lost their ever-lovin' minds?!?  And of course...we are seated right after they were...a mere 3 booths from their table. Our lovely discussion and meal was punctuated by high-pitched screams, squeals, crying and temper tantrums.  And for once, it wasn't all coming from me.  So, I have to say, minus one to the manager of CPK for letting this party through.  I realize that as a business one must try to get as much business as one can, but let's take a look at the facts.  This was at lunch, on the Saturday before Xmas.  The mall is packed and there is a wait for the tables as it is.  Now, while getting a nice 30 top in, might seem good on paper, as the majority of the party were kids under 5, chances are, they were not going to eat a whole pizza by themselves.  At most, they may eat 2 slices, which means that instead of selling 30 pizzas plus appetizers plus drinks, they probably only sold 15 pizzas.  Then, as this was a party of small children, you know that the parents would constantly need things from the server - more napkins, utensils, more drinks, drinks being spilled, etc.  A server may be able to handle a single 30 top of adults by themselves, but with the number of children involved, you know that there were at least one more, if not two more servers helping out at this party.  Finally, as a kids' birthday, this party probably ended up taking much longer then serving 30 individual customers as there wouldn't be a need to sing the birthday song, or eat cake (which wasn't even sold by CPK, but brought in from the outside).  So ultimately, taking the kids' birthday party for 5 year olds, on a busy Saturday, at prime lunch time no less, probably hurt their bottom line if you take all of the factors into consideration. I'm not sure if our server were one of the servers that helped the party, because he was very absent minded.  I ordered my pizza on wheat, and it was whole grain.  We asked for water with our drink order, and we had to remind him.  Also, by the time the food was served to us, it was lukewarm, not hot. So all in all, I was seriously disappointed by my experience here.  I was looking forward to it, as I used to love eating here.  I'm not sure if my patience for shoddy service has decreased, or if they have really gone downhill.  Either way, the chances of me coming back is slim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=80

Henry R.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,5.0,5/14/2013,"Many people like CPK. Many people like their pizzas. Other people hate it. They think their pizza tastes bad, and you can get better pizzas for a better deal at other restaurants. But they probably have not tried what I have tried; the menu item everyone skips over, the menu item that nobody would expect, the menu item that everyone thinks will be cliche if they see it, as it is not CPK's normal style. Their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings. Now, you are probably thinking: ""Dumplings at a pizza place? They can't be good!"" Well, actually they are the best menu item they have! They aren't authentic chinese, exactly, but they still are very good! The rich, tender chicken is complemented by the extremely delicate pasta wrapper. I have never seen a pasta wrapper this delicate! And, to top it all off, it is drizzled with a delectable soy ginger chili sauce and topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Now, this is an appetizer, so don't expect it to fill your hunger up that much, you still need an entree. But these are such a great addition to your meal! Also, their dumplings aren't the only thing that is good there! More recently, I had my first dessert off their menu: Their butter cake! It is the best! It is a rich, tender cake served hot, with 6 pieces of whipped cream surrounding it. Plus, for a little more $$$, you can get it a la mode with vanilla ice cream, which I think is worth it. I also like their Thai Chicken Pizza, Peach Lemonade, Tuscan White Bean Hummus, and key Lime Pie.

Junaed S.,"Hanover, MD",166,67,73,2.0,10/24/2016,"I've been to a few CPKs and this is perhaps one of the worst ones. We came here on a Friday night and after a short wait, were seated at a nice large table in a quiet corner of the restaurant. We waited about 20 minutes to be greeted by the server, and another 10-15 minutes for our drinks.  We decided to just have our order ready when the server came to give us our drinks. We ordered the Fried Mac n Cheese for an appetizer, and two pizzas for the entree. The server disappeared and did not appear again until she came with our pizzas.....40 minutes later! The appetizers never came out.  The food was decent, but even compared to other CPKs, the same pizza did not taste as good (probably a little bit overcooked). Would much rather have eaten at one of the many great food options at Montgomery Mall instead of here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda

Aakash P.,"Washington, DC",120,88,270,1.0,3/30/2016,"I live by Yelp ratings and I should have known better than to order from this AT BEST 2 star place. First of all, the delivery charge is ridiculous, $8.99 for delivery?! Might as well sell these nickle and dimers my freakin kidney! The food came about 1 hour and 10 minutes after ordering (rude again!) and the pizza dough was very burned! Also, we added Goat Cheese to a pizza for an extra $2.00 and they put like 3 tiny dallops of goat cheese on an entire pie of pizza. (THANK YOU YELP/EAT24 FOR PROVIDING A COUPON TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR WRONGDOING)  but anyways, the pizza was a little burned and also very cold by the time it came. What's even worse is that my fiance and I both spent a majority of the night passing it through our system! (yeah...do you really want to order from here now?!?)  Good luck if you decide to take the plunge into this bad food delivery experience..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda
Kurt M.,"Bethesda, MD",0,5,,1.0,9/5/2017,"Terrible service at dinner. Entrees arrived before our drinks. My kid's order was wrong: Hawaiian pizza instead of the BBQ Chicken he ordered; despite being a ""rush order,"" the correct pizza took 20 minutes, by which time everyone else had finished eating. The bok choy was not properly rinsed, so sand was inside. The edge of the table was sticky, which got another kid's shirt all sticky. When the bill arrived, it included two items we had never ordered, then a subtraction of their cost as a ""comp,"" so only the actual final amount was correct. The waitress never offered to do anything, such as comp us for the wrong pizza, despite these problems. And the manager also did nothing to try and make up for these problems, when my wife went and talked to the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda
Priscilla Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",341,559,2558,3.0,2/21/2015,"This CPK is steps below the one in Gaithersburg. Service and quality was lacking. Our server brought us wrong things. My friend ordered a Thai Crunch Salad without avocado, but he brings one with avocado. I order a glass of Beringer White Zinfandel, a white wine, but end up getting a glass of Merlot, a red wine. Since it was difficult to flag down our server, I didn't bother to change it. I just needed some wine before watching 50 Shades of Grey.  I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, which is usually one of my favorites at CPK. This one was just okay. A lot of the fettuccine was clumped together. There is supposed to be chunks of chicken in the pasta, but here the chicken was little itty bitty pieces. CPK has a rewards program app. I had 5 dough points and asked our server about it, but he wasn't very helpful.

Roland R.,"Bethesda, MD",0,34,,1.0,3/20/2015,"I ordered a delivery from CPK from Takeout Taxi.  The tortilla soup was fine, and the stuffed pepper was adequate.  The pizza was very poor--probably not even Domino's quality, except for the thin crust (extra $).  I have never seen a pizza that had so little tomato sauce that the pie was crust-colored.  What few splotches of red color came from the microscopically thin pepperoni shavings.  There were a few hyper-thin shavings of pepperoni, 3 or 4 small pieces of sausage, and 3 or 4 very thin portobello shavings ($2 extra).  My reaction when opening the box was ""Are you kidding me??""  The pizza was also super salty.  To compound the matter, the pizza was sliced very indifferently (odd, seemingly random cuts, and not all the way through), so I needed to cut the pizza myself.  It seems as though CPK at this location has no attention to detail.  I will not get a pizza from them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=60

Lorena B.,"Frederick, MD",119,556,368,4.0,10/17/2012,"Maybe I just have a soft spot for CPK because I'm old enough to remember when the only options for pizza were Sbarro's, Pizza Hut, and the school cafeteria. Then one day, along comes CPK, with their newfangled ideas of bbq sauce and chicken on a pizza. Cray cray, right? My favorite pizza is the four cheese with tomato and basil. The wild mushroom is pretty good too and so is the previously mentioned bbq chicken. And when I'm pretending to be a healthy eater, the veggie pizza hits the spot. I haven't actually sat down to dinner here in years but I get takeout pizzas once every couple of months. They always get my order right and it's ready within the time frame quoted.

Hannah K.,"Columbia, MD",1,31,54,1.0,2/28/2013,"Came here on Saturday around 5pm for dinner with my sister. We needed a break from shopping so came to eat dinner here. the restaurant wasn't that busy, we just waited 5 minutes for a table to clear. The hostess took us back to our seats, and the waiter was clearing the table while we waited by our table. They didn't wipe down the table and the table was sticky. I think the previous customers spilled something sweet. I wish the hostess would have given the waiter enough time to clear and  the table properly before seating us.... Okay now to the food, the price is RIDICULOUSLY high. My sister and I ordered the California Veggie Pizza (original crust on honey wheat). The pizza wasn't anything special and didn't seem fresh. Also, the broccoli looked odd/weird. We were really excited and we thought it would be a big enough pizza to share and OH MY GOSH... the pizza is the size of a small pizza that you can order individually. I thought for a price of almost $13 we would have received a larger size. At Bertucci's (my favorite Pizza restaurant) you pay $18 (for just $4 more) for a large Margherita pizza. Bertucci's portion size is better and you can taste how fresh the dough and ingredients are. CPK lacked all those qualities in their pizza Oh and the bread we got seemed a little stale/store bought (definitely not fresh). We didn't eat any of the bread. Probably won't come here again- overpriced and I can find tastier pizza for a better deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=60
Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,247,144,4.0,1/22/2013,"4 stars is generous.  The food keeps the rating high.  Everyone likes CPK.  Everyone has their favorite dish at CPK.  But, everyone has their reasons why they hate CPK.   I have had all kind of items off of their menu, from salads to soups (yeah smashed pea & barely!), to strange-sounding but delicious pizzas.  Its the kind of place where you want to finish the entire pizza (its that good), but you don't want to be judged...so you take half home with you.  So good.  My gripes:  1. Prices...wow!  I would come here a lot more often if the menu was just a bit more reasonably priced.   2. The staff always seems upset at one another.  They try to not show it, but you can cut the tension with a knife.  Its like they all hate each other or hate the job or something.  I can't quite describe it other than a pervasive feeling of misery. 3. Why are there always 8 million kids in there?  It doesn't look like anyplace children would enjoy, especially considering the many bottles of wine on display at the entrance.  The 8 million kids also means the place is full of screaming and crying...I never want to stay a second longer than I have to. 4. I've only gotten take-out once, but they made me decide to never try it again.  I ordered soup and a salad.  They asked if I wanted utensils and I said yes.  I didn't receive the soup (strange, because I was charged for it).  I discovered it before leaving the parking lot, so I was able to come back in and get it.  However, I never got those utensils.  Why bother asking?  It wasn't even busy, it was like 4:00 on a weekday afternoon.  If that job is too stressful for the person working the take-out area, find someone else who doesn't cave under the pressure of putting together an order of soup and salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bethesda?start=60
