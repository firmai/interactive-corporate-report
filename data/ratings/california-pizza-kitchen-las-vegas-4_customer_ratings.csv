276,Luis P.,"Las Vegas, NV",100,75,264.0,4.0,2012-02-13,"I've been a CPK fan ever since they were a small pizza franchise in the early days. CPK serves quality pizza and pastas with fresh ingredients, and good service. And now, despite growing in size and location, CPK has stayed mostly true to it's roots, keeping their food quality unchanged and the service above and beyond the norm. This is the first time me and the wife has tried CPK at this busy location (Town Square), one because it was always crowded, and two because being a tourist-centric location we feared it might take a toll on the quality of the food and service. We were delightfully proven wrong however, our server was friendly, attentive and prompt, our meal (Wild Mushroom Pizza and Chicken Piccata) arrived in a timely manner and tasted just how it was -- very good. We left fairly satisfied and happy knowing that CPK has achieved what most restaurant food chains have failed in growth: maintaining what you loved about them at the beginning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003

113,Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",582,846,10004.0,4.0,2012-06-12,"After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT! So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste. The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy. Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely. But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana. One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin. Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.3120000000000003,3.4800000000000004

I had the peach salad. It had caramelized peaches, dried cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese, and red onions on a bed of spinach tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also added grilled chicken to it.

140,Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1212,879,2797.0,4.0,2012-10-03,"I must say:  Pleasantly Surprised!  I enjoyed this one even more so than the one located in the Mirage Hotel. They now have a 'low calorie' menu, it's definitely more pricey than their other menu, but sometimes you have to pay not to be tempted.  You can go online and download a full and comprehensive caloric menu from their website.  For instance, ordering the pizza thin crust makes a pretty big difference. Our server was very bubbly and attentive, she was their corporate trainer based on the pin on her lapel, dark hair really cute glasses.  They have 1/2 salads and full portions too, which is nice. I ordered the under 500 calorie shrimp scampi zucchini pasta--I loved it. Especially for being healthy. It had tons of garlic and a lot of flavor. I added spinach and roasted red peppers to it for some more veggies. I'm going to try and replicate it at home. It was very very good. My friend ordered lettuce wraps [chicken and shrimp which somehow has more calories & fat than just the chicken or just the shrimp? which is confusing but whatever] she ate 'em up. Her husband ordered a 1/2 salad which he finished in it's entirety and then managed to eat a couple of her lettuce wraps. Food took a little longer than I would've liked to come out, but it was very busy. Would also love if they served some pizza bread for a starter [even though that is not on the diet].  1/2 salad & 1/2 pizza option would be very nice too. Music was very loungey this time I felt like I was in a nightclub, kind of techno funky was unusual but I didn't mind it. I also took out a to-go order for one of our co-workers, when I was walking out the manager basically bolted to open the door for me [and he was in mid discussion with the hostess].

They are consistent, clean and efficient and I give them points for that. It is straightforward food that lacks any memorable qualities. Had the Thai Chicken Salad. Fresh, crunchy cabbage. The chicken portion was extremely small. Lightly dressed which was healthier but not as tasty as I remember.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=180,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.2440000000000007,3.6000000000000005
254,Ron F.,"Woodland, CA",16,164,35.0,4.0,2012-11-24,"I've always been a fan, with my usual favorites. The pizza is good to share when I'm not super hungry. The lettuce wraps and sesame chicken dumplings (pot stickers) are great if you're after appetizers. When we've decided on our own entrees, my favorite is the kung pao spaghetti. It's a little bit stronger than I prefer but when they have a good cook in the kitchen I can get it tamed down without being bland.  Prices are a little on the high side, but not by much and only when I order more than I probably should have anyway. Bread is just by request now. I've always left full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=240,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3120000000000003,3.5600000000000005
79,Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,601,120.0,4.0,2013-02-03,"This has always been a favorite for us no matter where we've lived.  We don't go as often as we used to but came here because they sent us a coupon for a free dessert, lol, for my husband's birthday.  We usually get sat in a big, comfortable booth.  They have ""small bites"" appetizers and we tried the mediterranean focaccia bread.  It's really delicious but they don't give enough of the dipping oil, which would be my only complaint about it.   My husband is disappointed because they got rid of his favorite pizza, the bacon cheeseburger pie.  But he really loves their bolognese sauce and always enjoys his pasta dishes.   The waiter kept our glasses full all dinner long, which is something of a lost art in these parts, haha.  The dessert is the real kicker.  All of their desserts are purely gluttonous and amazing.  We've tried almost all of them but the hidden gem is the butter cake!  How could something so simple be so good?!?  And it's a thousand times better if you get it a la mode.  It's so soft and light it literally melts in your mouth.  Of course my other complaint is that I always leave here feeling like a cow because of how much I ate.  But at least I'm not going hungry!  If you haven't had this for a while I think you should definitely rediscover it because the service and the food are pretty awesome for a chain restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.2800000000000002,3.5600000000000005
166,Julie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1073,280,2724.0,3.0,2013-03-06,I have a lunch date with my mother every Saturday afternoon and we decided on CPK so we could do some shopping at TS after lunch last Saturday.. I hadn't been to CPK in forever and the only location I've ever been to is the one at Fashion Show. We arrived at 3:30 and surprisingly the place was full and there was a 15 minute wait.   This place reminded me of Chuckie Cheese with all the kids everywhere. LOL I much prefer the atmosphere at the Fashion Show location. Everything here just seemed kind of cheap even the napkins... & I swear I remember the food tasting much better. -Mango Sangria: Reminded me of Mexican candy which I happen to like haha but there were only 3 pieces of fruit in there and I couldn't even taste any wine/alcohol..  -Grilled Peaches & Shrimp Salad: Loved this salad!!! Tangy dressing and fresh field greens.. Shrimp were small though.  -Wild mushroom Pizza with chicken: This used to me my favorite pizza. I feel like there used to be more mushrooms with stronger flavors. The crust used to be perfect and kind of sweet. -Jambalaya Pasta: It was too spicy/peppery for me. I prefer Cheesecake Factory's version..  -Complimentary bread: Wasn't even warm & the butter was ice cold.   Service was friendly. I just think with so many other options at TS.. California Pizza Kitchen doesn't stand out. & if I really wanted their pizza I could get it in the frozen aisle at the grocery store.

I sat at the bar, and had the greatest server. He needed a shoutout. I asked him for suggestions on the menu, he had options for me, and suggested two salads, and something that caught my eye- the Spinach & Artichoke Pizza. We discussed in length the difference between that pizza and the classic BBQ Chicken. Well, His suggestions were great, didn't try to oversell me and cracked me up the entire time I was there.

We asked if we could sit somewhere where the stroller could be parked nearby and the hostess told us that strollers weren't allowed in the restaurant. So we took the car seat out if the stroller and they showed us to a booth. The booths were really cramped and the car seat wouldn't fit on the booth seat. This other hostess took the car seat out of my friends hands and basically wedged it between the table and the back of the booth. Ummmm... Not safe. We asked for a sling and they said the slings couldn't be set out because it would be a fire hazard. A few minutes later I looked behind me and there was a lady sitting at a table with her stroller parked next to her and on the other side of the restaurant was a woman with her car seat on a sling. Fail. Update: I sent a note via their website asking how/why this happened.  A manager from the restaurant called me and apologized for the incident and sent me a gift certificate to use at any CPK restaurant.  I haven't received the gift certificate yet, but I appreciated the prompt apology and their effort to address what happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=240,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.8240000000000003,3.6800000000000006

258,Jim J.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,18,,2.0,2013-09-08,"Like it says, I've experienced better. I'm a fan of CPK.  I used to buy the CPK frozen pizzas until the topping disappeared.  So I stopped buy them and switched to Red Baron.  BTW. Very happy since I switched to Red Baron!! Okay, back to CPK.. Now, I visit for the first time in over 8 years. I went to the location at Town Square. After a 40 minute wait, we were seated.  I didn't mind the wait since we bought an iMac from the Apple Store while waiting.  I also had enough time to shop at The Container Store.  Okay, maybe the wait was more than 40 minutes.  We were seated in a nice booth.  We had an opportunity to look at the menu and were greated by a waitress that was quiry to say the least. She had a quite intensity. I dare not upset her. I was extra nice to her and she seemed to respomd well to the nice gesture. When my buddy's gf wasn't paying much attention, the server became aggitated.  I felt then need to apologize for the gf's lack of attention. Anyways, the meal was good.  The toppings were thick.  The only was that the server disappeared for long periods.  Our drinks ran empty three times and nobody was to be found. She also took a long time to bring and process the check.  The whole process from start to finish took two hours. We only ordered two pizzas and some drinks.  My friend did not like his Bloody Mary. I had strawberry tea, which was good.   Normally, I would be unhappy about the long wait and the even longer service, but at least I had already accomplished my shopping and we weren't late for the movie we came to see.  Maybe we saved money since the girls didn't have time to shop.

Right when you you walk and ask the hostess for a gf menu they know what you are talking about, which is nice. The waiters are also well trained and very familiar with the gluten free options. When ever you order gluten free the manager comes over and explains their process of avoiding cross contamination and then hand delivers the pizza to you. The pizza are delicious and high quality.

112,Doriee D.,"Las Vegas, NV",252,348,1257.0,3.0,2014-04-16,"I've been coming to this CPK ever since it first opened, which was when Town Square first opened. Granted, I don't go THAT often but on and off -- usually with friends or family. I typically prefer this location over the one at Fashion Show Mall only because I hate venturing towards the direction of the strip. Not only that but this location is bigger.  However, I don't have a single memory of exceptional service from this establishment. Not once in the amount of odd years it's been around. In fact, I remember one time, when I went with friends, no one came to our table for a LONG while (not even for drink orders) so what did we do? Build a fort out of the menus. I know, we were so immature but funny thing was, that didn't get their attention.  I just recently came back to dine at this establishment with my family after being away from Las Vegas for three years, and I gotta say... the service certainly hasn't improved. I gotta admit, it's not as busy as it used to be, but it still took a LONG while for any server to acknowledge our existence after we got seated. There was nothing wrong with the hostess, but there was something wrong with the waitresses. I think it took so long that ANOTHER waitress that wasn't OUR waitress came to take our orders because no one else helped us. Which caused a little confusion later on when the food arrived.  Other than that, everything else went fine. After we got our food, we were happy campers.  Speaking of the food, it is pretty on point. It's pretty good. One of my favorite is their bolognese pasta. Sometimes I like to ask for them to make it spicy, in which they add pepper flakes to the pasta. Always turns out yummy. The garlic cream fettuccine is also another favorite of mine but sometimes, the flavor can be so-so. Oh, their tiramisu never disappoints either :)  Not a bad place. Not a fabulous place.

I Mountaintown Square on Las Vegas Blvd. and I'm hungry. So of course I would love to go try something new. Hence California pizza kitchen. So my mother arrives we decide to go in and try it.  All I can say is disappointing! The food lackluster and locked flavor. The presentation was less than heart. And the prices were outrageous. Not to mention their major competitor is Sammy's woodfired pizza. Sammy is offers gluten-free variations of pastas and crusts to appeal to a wider variety of people. To my surprise California pizza kitchen only has five pizzas that you can get the gluten-free crust and has absolutely no other gluten-free menu and no gluten-free pasta. Being a celiac this was disappointing!  Now let's talk about the service. The gentleman seated us was very nice and the weather was nice but completely uneducated in anything that has to do with any aspect of anything Culinary. When I inquired about if they had pasta that was made without me because my son had a dairy allergy he replied ""well the only pasta with diary is going to be our fettuccine Alfredo or mac & cheese.""obviously I know that Alfredo and macaroni and cheese obviously has ""cheese"" and has Dairy. So why would I order that for my son? Wouldn't. Again I stated ""no, my son has all dairy allergies including eggs. So again that your pasta have eggs?"" He quickly ran to go check and came back and stated that all their pasta egg. Again very disappointing. All in all besides the lack of a gluten-free menu, the lack of ambience, the lack of an educated staff, and the outrageous prices, the food  was lack luster and was not visually appealing.

Our hostess was good about getting our drinks started right away. She answered all of our questions in a prompt and friendly manner. She was also really attentive about refilling our drinks. We ordered a pizza, half California Club, and half the Works. Please keep in mind that these pizzas are medium-sized, so you get 6 slices total. My husband had the Works: a take on supreme pizza. He liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. I had the California Club and I cannot express in words how good it was! It comes with bacon, cheese, romaine tossed in lemon pepper mayonnaise, and it is topped with avocado. The avocado and romaine were super fresh and the lemon pepper mayonnaise was the bomb!

My friend started with the wedge salad on the small plates menu. I could see the water dripping off of the lettuce and all the ingredients appeared to be thrown on the plate. Not a good value for almost $6. Next came our entrees, the oriental chicken salad and Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza. Once again, both dishes did not appear thoughtfully made. My salad contained iceberg lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and chicken the only substantial ingredient. The salad was exactly like a mix from the grocery store. The dressing was fine although a little heavy for the ingredients in the salad. My friend was also underwhelmed with her pizza. Her pizza was soaked in BBQ sauce, it was undercooked, and you could tell the quality of the mozzarella was low by the plastic like texture.

PIZZAS The Original BBQ Chicken (original hand tossed): I'm confident that I can eat this single-handedly. BBQ chicken + GOUDA CHEESE on pizza as a perfect combo and completely threw me off. It has just the right amount of sweet and savory flavors. Wild Mushroom (original hand tossed): I love mushrooms on my pizza, but this was practically bland. We didn't order the white truffle oil, which might've added that missing flavor factor. I'm not saying the pizza wasn't good, but it didn't stand out among the others.  Margherita (thin crust): Simple and delicious. I loved the cheesy, stringy Mozzarella, but I wasn't a fan of the crust. Despite that, the pie was a hit.  DESSERT Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake: Warm, rich and fudgy, and it's served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  SERVICE Great. Make reservations ahead of time.

Their Townsquare location is the main one I visit since it's the closest to home and since Townsquare always has a nice feel with all the trees and everything. Let's start with service, sometimes it's a hit or miss with the servers but generally pretty good. One thing that they're really good at is keeping wait times low even though it gets crazy. Onto the food! I've loved everything I've tried here except for their Jambalaya Pasta. That dish scarred me Lol idk if they made it wrong or something but that just had a horrible flavor. I had my boyfriend taste it too and he said it was pretty bad Lol. But thankfully that's the only bad thing I've had. My current favorites are the Avocado Club Eggrolls, Cedar Plank Salmon, Tequila Fettucine, Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza & Pear/Gorgonzola Pizza on Hand-Tossed Crust. I'm not a fan of thin crust at all so I'm happy that they can make any of the thin-crust pizzas on regular hand-tossed. Now their Butter Cake with Haagen Daaz ice cream deserves it's own paragraph. Oh my Goodness. I remember the first time being introduced to it, We wanted a dessert but didn't know which one to go with and our waitress was like, ""You're not true CPK Fans till you've given our Butter Cake a try.""

I've also ordered to-go many times and everytime, the pizza, salads, etc were all the same quality as you would get dining there.

We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. They are normally very good, but this time they were barely warm. The food runner who brought them out actually stopped in the middle of the restaurant to text for a minute and then brought our egg rolls. Extremely unprofessional. I was a little irked that our waitress offered all her other tables bread, but not ours. Since we had ordered an appetizer I wasn't too upset, but the inconsistency in the service was irritating. I order pasta for my daughter, which was also barely warm by the time we got it. The barbecue chicken salad we got was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. And then it took forever to get our check.

When we asked for bread, she only gave us 3 pieces and we were four people while we saw a group of 2 get 5-6 pieces of breads. While we had our food she didn't come to see how the food was. While we were eating she just dropped down the bill  like she wanted us out in a hurry. My mother was eating her Cobb salad and the bacon was cold and raw. My father ordered a vegetarian pizza and asked for goat cheese and when the pizza came it had no goat cheese and on the bill they charged us extra for goat cheese. The pizza I ordered was a barbecue chicken and it was good. But like I said she rushed us out. When we were eating she came up to us and asked us for dessert. While my family was of course still eating. She deserved no tip at all. I would recommend while in Las Vegas. Don't go this California pizza kitchen.

I love how the menu offers small plates and meals on the lighter side. I ordered my food from the small plates section. I had my own asparagus and arugula salad and split the Bianco flatbread with my friend.   The arugula salad was perfectly light and not drenched in dressing like some salads are. It was a complete balance of bitterness from the arugula and sweetness from the fire roasted tomatoes. The cheese was sliced so thin that you could see through it, so it also gave the salad a nice savory touch. The Bianco flatbread was stunningly delicious. It was brushed with a thin layer of truffle oil and garnished with a little bit of greens and covered in mozzarella cheese. Within every bite was a whiff of truffle oil. It was a definite five stars overall for the food. I knocked off a star from my rating of CPK because our waitress seemed to be new at her job. She was nervous while taking our order, but she was kind and quick enough to serve us complimentary bread with oil (which wasn't the best bread I've ever indulged on).  However, when we were finished with our food, she came to get our plates, and because she seemed nervous, she accidentally dropped one of our plates on the table and broke it. We knew it was an accident, but I saw the manager standing close by looking at us, and she didn't do anything about it. However, my experience was wonderful at CPK minus the part where the service was a little lacking in confidence and management.

Surprisingly I haven't gone to the one in Town Square, however, that changed today. One of my girlfriends wanted to catch up with a light lunch and recommended we go here. We shared the Tortilla Spring Rolls as an app - you can choose from 3 different kinds and we got the Mediterranean Veggie and the Thai Chicken (Baja Chicken is the third choice). Three small portions of each came out with a marinara sauce for the veggie and a sweet peanut sauce for the thai spring rolls. They were both pretty tasty and a great way to start our lunch.  I wanted a salad and went with the half portion of the Waldorf Chicken Salad and my friend got the half portion of the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The half portions are humongous and look like a full portion to me. Perfect size for lunch. My salad was incredibly delicious! Mixed greens with grapes, green apples, celery, chicken, candied walnuts, crumbled Gorgonzola, pre-tossed in a light vinaigrette. I wouldn't recommend getting this salad if you don't like Gorgonzola because as you know, it has a strong distinct taste and can be overpowering in any dish. I didn't mind at all because I LOVE cheese and Gorgonzola.  Katie was our server and she was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us quite often to make sure we were enjoying everything and to refill our drinks. I'm very satisfied with my lunch today and would gladly go back!

232,Nadia L.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,75,125.0,1.0,2015-11-23,"I visited the newly remodeled Town Square location on Saturday (11/21) around 11:45am. We asked to sit outside because it was a nice cool afternoon. They sat us and from that point on it was as if we didn't exist. I order what I've been ordering for the last 15 years, the full size BBQ chicken salad. Since I always order that, I know what the portion is supposed to look like. The price has increased and the salad has shrunk. The full size is now comparable to what the half size used to be. I was very disappointed. How do you justify higher price for less food? When they dropped off my salad I asked the guy for a side of ranch. He said ""sure"" and that was the last I saw of him. I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come check on me outside so I can ask again. Finally, I had to leave my table and go inside the restaurant to ask a random cashier to get me a side of ranch. By this time, my salad was old, undersized, and just tasted wrong. Perhaps the whole experience is what put a bad taste in my mouth, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. Flagging down a waitress to address my issue was the ongoing challenge of the day (it wasn't busy). My friend that was dining with me literally stood up and waived her arms in the air from side to side to get someone's attention. That didn't work either. She was frustrated for me, and this was holding us up because she was already done eating. She went inside the restaurant and grabbed what seemed to be the manager. I didn't go into all of my issues because I didn't have the patience. I told them the salad that I always get didn't taste right and I just want them to prepare me the Garlic Cream Fettuccine and pack it TO GO since this has been a long drawn out ordeal. I felt like the manager was trying to upsell when he tried to push the grilled chicken option on me. I said ""my chicken experience hasn't been good today so I'll pass"". He pushed it on me more and I agreed to it just to get it done. I was told the salad would be taken off my bill. I thought to myself ""that's a given, the salad wasn't made well, basically untouched and I'm sending it back""... When I got the bill, they offered no discount for my inconvenience, no free dessert, nothing. I'm just very put off by this experience. I hate that I'm going to have to stop coming to a place that I so often visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=200,4.0,3.78,3.78,2.9800000000000004,3.8680000000000003

I usually try to avoid this restaurant unless it's the one in downtown summerlin. Well I had no choice this last time. I met up with some friends and they all voted for CPK. I tried to stay positive and go with the flow. We go in and are told it'll be at least twenty five minutes. Since there isn't much space to wait and we all had our kids, we decided to go to the Disney art store for a bit.         Once we returned we were automatically seated. The waitress seemed friendly and greeted us within a few minutes, but ordering food and drinks is where the problem came in. She took our drink order and after ten minutes they finally arrived (one alcoholic beverage and three waters). She then comes to take our order and we request if she'll return in one minute. Ten minutes later she returns again. So my friends all order pizza and I order the chicken tequila pasta. Close to 30 minutes later a server brings out the pizza and asked if I ordered anything. I told him I ordered the pasta and all of a sudden he looked really nervous. I was pretty hungry and trying not to over react (I take my food very seriously, it's not that hard to get an order right). The waitress came to us and admitted that my meal was sent to the wrong take and the person at the table already started eating it. She apologized and said she put another order in. When the my pasta came out she was genuinely apologetic. By the end of the meal, she said she took my meal of the tab. I really appreciate restaurants that make mistakes and own up to it, not just make a pathetic excuse and just say sorry. My problem is that this location always messes something up when I come in. Maybe I have a stamp on my head that says ""mess up his order"" or maybe their job is really that hard? The one think I do know, I'll probably not be returning to this location.

However it's what took place after that really sealed the deal on whether or not we would return. The waitress brought me a Dr. Pepper that she later admitted she knew was watered down and after she dropped it off with our food, she didn't return for 15 minutes. So, I went my entire meal without a drink. When she returned, which only happened after I requested for the manager, she said she knew it was watered down but served it anyway instead of changing the soda in the back. She made us wait continuously throughout the night for refills, desert and even for our check. I don't complain often, but the icing on the cake was when she brought our check after us waiting for another 10 minutes for it she circled where the tip chart was on the bottom and she made it seem as if we wouldn't have tipped If she hadn't.

110,Ann H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,69,1.0,1.0,2016-07-19,"I worked at CPK in 1987. I'm a fan and very familiar with their menu. Calling this place and getting the take out girl on the phone was enough to break glass, the girl's whiny fake voice is unbearable. I ordered a salad SPECIFICALLY to include bread, and as per expected with this world of 0.0 attention span of those under 25, there was no bread.  When I inform her that I asked for bread, she has no reaction at all, and when I say the word ""that I specifically"" asked, she is taken back because she now knows that I know it was her who took my order and it was she who screwed up and tried to lie about it. These people need to be trained that a customer has an ""experience"" when they come to your business.  That experience begins finding parking, who greets them at the door, etc, etc. How likely am I to order take out again, knowing that the person who answers the phone doesn't pay attention, and doesn't care that she doesn't. It wasn't that it happened, it's that she didn't care that she screwed up.

But we come here for the salads. Great portions for a great price. If you haven't had the roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken you are not living life!

Many other places make Amazon BBQ chicken salads, but this is the place that gave everyone the opportunity to sell them. Get the salad if you're into originals.

We got there as the rush ended, and we're seated within 10 minutes.  Our server started out friendly and talkative at first. But as time progressed, the service went downhill. It took at least 15 min for us to get our appetizer, and then about 45 minutes to get our pizza. Not only that,  but the server never apologized for how long it was taking for our food to come out. I noticed another table of 5 (compared to our 2) had ordered the same appetizer, and received it quicker than we did. Hummus shouldn't take 15 minutes. Also, once we got the pizza,  the server made sure that it was not made with wheat since that's what I'm allergic to...however....I found it very odd that he said he made our pizza himself. Once we were ready for our check,  the process took another 10 to 15 minutes since we didn't know where our server was, and we had to ask someone else if we could have our check. Our server seemed to be in lala land.

Service tonight was great! Our server was attentive and waters were refilled without us asking. Food is amazing as always.  3/5  wild mushroom strozzapreti- I wasn't a huge fan of the pasta, it was on the harder side so if I were to order this dish again, I would probably sub penne or fusilli for it. I don't believe there was a sauce to it... maybe just olive oil or something but I did enjoy the variety of mushrooms (not that I could tell the different mushrooms apart). My friend said the dish was kind of on the bitter side, but I only had two bites and couldn't really tell nor mind it.  4/5 Kung pao spaghetti with chicken-  despite all the dried red chili peppers, its not spicy! Spaghetti noodles were cooked perfectly, however it was on the salty side and lacked some peanuts. I gave two of my gfs a bite and they loved it.  5/5 Bbq chicken salad with avocado- I've tried lazy dog's, BJs and a few other restaurants' bbq chopped salad and they don't seem to compare to CPK's. The full sized salad made for a good appetizer for the table (party of 6)  before our entrees came out. I was glad that it wasn't drenched in dressing unlike previous visits.

The first time we went (1/21/17), we had an okay experience. The food was good overall, though there were a few things that were off: the bread was stale, our food came with toppings we specifically requested removed, and the raspberry iced tea was mostly too-sweet raspberry flavoring with a pinch of tea. The service was also a bit slow, but we enjoyed our time there. So, using a gift card I had been given, I tipped just under 10% -- leaving the balance exactly $11. Today (4/2/17) we went again, and it was a great expereience. The food, drinks and service were fantastic, and we were very happy during our time there. The problem came when we went to pay the bill. I still had my original receipt from my old gift card, which showed it should have had $11 left. However, when we went to pay, it the balance was only $8. I was shocked, and then, disturbed to realize that the server from our first experience--who turned out to be our same server today, Chad--had clearly tipped himself an extra $3 when he ran our card back in January. I didn't want to cause a scene and call him out--we had a fine time there today, after all--but that kind of behavior is inexcuseable. Since our server took the liberty of tipping himself extra last time, we left without leaving a tip. We love CPK-- but hate that our date was turned sour by staff's shady behavior.

My friend ordered her pizza without red onions and he forgot to note that down because her pizza came out with red onions.

I also found a small piece of hair in my salad and took it out but I didn't complain about it. The pizzas we all ordered was really good.

9,Lauren C.,"Henderson, NV",284,984,2581.0,4.0,2017-08-05,"Somehow I just dined at CPK (as people tell me it's called) for the first time. This location is conveniently located smack in the middle of Town Square near Whole Foods and The Container Store. We arrived just before noon and waited a few minutes to be seated. The restaurant was nearly full for lunch on a weekday. Once seated our waitress came over soon after to take our drink orders and then our food orders when we were ready. She didn't waste time getting orders in, but didn't rush us to order either. The menu has a nice variety of options and they definitely offer more than just pizza. The lunch combination option had quite a few items to choose from and was reasonably priced. It includes pizza, sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were fun drink options like non-alcoholic refreshers and teas too. Calorie counts are listed next to each item which made it easy to make a smarter choice. I went with the combination of Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza and a Caesar Salad. The salad was tasty and I liked the garlic croutons. The pizza was a nice size. I liked the overall flavor and the crust on the pizza. We had to pass on dessert since we were on a lunch break, but they had some good looking options that I'd love to try next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.16,3.6,3.6,3.088,3.424000000000001
15,Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",405,1023,2308.0,4.0,2017-08-10,California Pizza Kitchen has always felt overrated to me but then again I guess it's because I don't like eating at places that don't keep it real about the ingredients that they use. That's a different review though let me give some credit where it is due! Specifically for this visit to the Town Square location my co worker invited me to a nice business lunch. We arrived and of course the place was packed because hello it's lunch time duh!  Talked to the hostess about the wait and was quayside maybe 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we were finally seated and I can't be made because hey it was only 5 minutes of a difference! I was looking for something light and not really in the mood for pizza but seriously who declines a free lunch? Not me!  Ahh but if course they have an extensive menu with alternate options so why not be open to a spinach And quinoa said with a nice piece of Salmon on top! Sounds good to me! I washed it down with one of the new refreshing cucumber mint drinks! Super yummy and out server made it an effort to not let my glass stay empty that was the best part! The full portion salad is huge and I really should've down the lunch size but whatever it was so worth it! The service here was amazing so I really have to come back again this time not for business so I can have a great cocktail! Great job CPK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.2,3.63,3.63,3.12,3.458

This location was recently remodeled and has a new fresh look inside. The staff was very warm and welcoming and even brought us out a Bianco Flatbread for coming in today. This included whipped truffle cream, gorgonzola, mozzarella cheeses and fresh sage. Very nice of them. For the meal we decided on splitting a full size Thai Crunch, we could have had a half size but now I have some leftovers for dinner. The salad was delicious and comes with crisp veggies and fresh cilantro, chicken and peanuts, wontons and rice sticks, then it's tossed in a Thai peanut dressing.

This most recent time, we had decided to come to CPK for dinner for something small, prior to an event nearby. We had arrived around 630-645ish and were seated within 5 minutes. We had opt'ed to sit outside because the weather had been amazing these past few days. One side to outdoor seating was already full. The other side had two 2-person tables left.  Our waiter had came fairly soon after we had been seated and got our drink orders placed. We had both opted for a ""uniquely non-alcoholic"" drink Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler which consisted of fresh strawberries hand-shaken w/ Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava, and ginger.  Not too sweet. Quite refreshing. Nice to enjoy on a nice day out :) We both had enjoyed our drinks. I ate her strawberries too. There was a slice of lime in the drink too ! No i didnt eat that Lol  --------------------------- Along with our drink orders, we had ordered some food as well. Not too much, but enough to hold us until the event which had desserts and champagne provided.. XD  Before our food came out, we were served with some fresh warm bread with a small bowl of olive oil and herb. The bread was super tasty and fresh. Nice crispy crust and soft inside. The olive oil and herb tasted really nice as well !  Spinach Artichoke Dip served hot with housemade blue & white corn tortilla chips Surprisingly for an appetizer, its quite the large portion of dip. Their housemade chips were thin and crispy. The dip isnt too overpowering/strong but creamy and delicious. Yummy !  Carne Asada Pizza w/ tender marinated steak, fire-roasted poblanos, cilantro pesto, yellow onions, mozzarella, monterey jack cheese and fresh cilantro served with housemade salsa verde This was like... a taco as a pizza. ""New item"" on the menu. Lol the steak was indeed tender, topped with the side of housemade salsa verde really made this like a taco. Very tasty. Fairly decent to try ! Ingredients melded pretty nice and worked well together.  Even with this amount of food, we still had 2 slices of pizza leftover, which i had taken home to eat as a snack later that night HAHA !  ------------------------ Overall, great experience. Was nice to enjoy the nice outdoor weather while its lasts cuz everyone knows vegas weather is bipolar.

I guess we were the last table of his for the night, but we had to wait and wait for him to come out from the back to even get his attention. He gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there and he was in a hurry because he wouldn't even let us answer his questions, he would just answer for us. (He asked if we wanted boxes and before we could answer he just said okay three boxes it is and walked off before we even asked the questions we needed to ask or even order out desert) We just didn't even bother with the second dessert we just decided to leave. It was so bad that I contemplated even talking to the manager because when we were leaving we payed and he came back right away to ask where his tip was. Honestly I cannot fathom how terrible tonight was. But to our past waiters/waitresses thank you for your hospitality.

As we realized that it would be pretty tight, I noticed a number of tables which were empty. It amounted to a whole section which was closed as they ran a wait list. We asked for another table with more room and we were directed to wait again.  When we got our new table about 10 minutes after that we noticed that the section was still closed.  For an appetizer we ordered the white corn guacamole and chips. For dinner, we ordered the California Veggie Pizza and a Roasted Veggie Salad.  The guacamole came out right away. The portion was rather small and in my opinion lacked flavor. We added salt to it.  Dinner took a while to come out, in my opinion, longer than it should have.

1,Christy K.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,88,178.0,5.0,2017-12-23,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants (after Cheesecake Factory). The pizza is great, but my favorite dishes are their salads. The Thai Crunch Salad includes edamame, peanuts, rice sticks, wonton strips, and a terrific peanut dressing. By ordering the dinner portion and only eating half, I can take home the remainder with extra dressing. When added to lettuce, my leftovers can make 2-3 more meals. They serve bread and olive oil automatically at each table. The bread is made fresh and very tasty (as is the olive oil). Employees at this and other CPKs have always been very professional in their service to customers. When traveling, CPK is a great place to pick up a to-go order to eat back in your hotel room. Call ahead and you'll be out the door in no time at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.4,3.58,3.688,,3.5080000000000005
27,Sheilicha S.,"Whitney Ranch, Henderson, NV",1,13,,5.0,2017-12-24,"Visited California Pizza Kitchen for the first time since I've lived in Vegas. I Loved going here with my daughter, family, and friends when I lived on the East Coast. I took a friend, he really enjoyed his  being that he's Vegan. It's kinda hard to find good places that are good to eat and the ambiance is inviting. This was his first time ever eating here, and he to really enjoyed himself. Nicole our server was very pleasant and vibrant. Our hostess was also very hospitable. The General Manager, was very attentive to everyone's satisfaction of everything. When the couple came in with a Golden Retriever that's when things started looking like the stars were gonna change to a lower amount. But I know it was absolutely too cold for the dog to be left in the car. They could've also ordered or been recommended to order Take Out. It's a different time and a lot of people really don't respect how other's would see that a animal in a restaurant not being a service animal sitting on the booth seats would be kinda unsanitary and unorthodox. Overall I Love pets, and there human as well in my eyes. I'll definitely go here again.  Thanks again Nicole for your great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=20,3.44,3.62,3.692,,3.5480000000000005

0,Larissa K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",55,78,31.0,4.0,2018-01-04,Love this beautiful outdoor mall and love this restaurant to boot. Ordered a small salad loaf and split margarita pizza. I had to ask for extra dressing as the salad was pretty dry. You can't please everyone in this department so no stars taken off for this.  Our waitress was polite and efficient. Margareta pizza was delicious however there were dry spots missing cheese. Not enough cheese. A pizza restaurant that lacks cheese on it's pizza. Step it up folks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.64,3.65,3.704,,3.6460000000000004
18,Saeid N.,"Rochester, MI",0,1,,4.0,2018-01-05,"Pros: The food is very delicious. My wife and I tried ""dynamite shrimp"" and ""BBQ chicken pizza"". Both were great especially the shrimp which was served with a sweet and yummy sauce. nice place next to the casino and all craziness.  Cons: The waiting time was relatively long. The food price is expensive; 7"" pizza starts from ~$20 and starter from ~$12.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.64,3.64,3.704,,3.6400000000000006
16,J B.,"North Bend, OR",0,39,23.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"Can't really give a fair review about the food cause we never got that far.  Checked with the hostess about a booth for two and was told a small wait please have a seat. After sitting down in the waiting area two separate couples also checked in after us.  Well one couple, who came in after us, was escorted to a booth. I thought perhaps they called in for reservations and no big deal. Then after an additional longer wait the second couple was escorted to a booth. I couldn't believe it so I went up to the hostess and asked what was going on?  She could only say she was sorry and it would be just a few minutes longer as they cleaned a booth.  I advised that I would like to speak with the manager after we get seated. The two of us was seated in a booth big enough to sit eight.  Unreal!  When the manager arrived I explained what occurred, and she was apologetic. I pointed out that families were waiting in the sitting area and we could not take this large booth while they waited as it wasn't right. I explained that we would just leave so she offered a rain check.  We refused the rain check and departed.  I can only say hospitality starts at the front door, and should extend throughout the establishment, but we didn't really feel it inside, and we do have choices where we wish to spend our money.  California Kitchen was one of our first choices but won't be a choice in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4,3.56,3.6,3.692,,3.5840000000000005
