This brand new location is sure to get the office crowd in, but I don't know that I'd return on my own merit. For as much updating Red Robin has done lately, this Red Robin is just like all the others. During lunch, sure, you'll get service at the bar. Portions have scaled down for onion rings. The taste and menu haven't changed much either. There's nothing new about Red Robin, just the decor. Their automated kiosks made the experience just that much more impersonal.

The service was very good, I was seated quickly in the bar area and the staff was very attentive.  The noise level can get high because this is a family friendly restaurant but not on this visit.  Unfortunately the food tonight was not up to the quality I've come to expect. The French dip sandwich was soggy before I was able to dip it in the au jus.

We entered the restaurant and had plenty of time to glance around the place, about five minutes, while the party in front of us tried to communicate the number of people in her party to the hostess. We saw plenty of empty tables and booths. We saw plenty of trash on the floor. Like, they should vacuum every once in a while. Many children, and an ungodly ambient noise level. TVs on sports channels. Like, why not variety and have a business or news channel in one section? Who cares about lame midday Friday sports? Finally our turn to be seated after hearing the prior party be told their table would be ready in about twenty minutes. The two of us were then told there would be a fifteen minute wait amidst all the empty seats. I glanced again at the dirty floor, the kids all over, listened to the noise and wife said: not worth it. Also of note, there are plenty of places that want to take our money. I don't need to wait to give it away. We said no, thanks.

24,Stephen G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,103,36.0,2.0,2017-07-11,"Sometimes, I'm totally in the mood for Red Robin... because French fries are even better when they are endless in my book. I recently tried their vegan burger at the I25 location and really liked it so we tried the version closer to our house tonight. It is new and we figured that would mean a great experience. However, things were off to a bad start as soon as we arrived. Parking is pretty annoying - there are only about 5 spots near the building and everything else is mall parking so it feels weird. Inside, the restaurant only had a few tables seated but there was no one at the host stand. We stood around a while until the manager eventually came by and seated us. At a dirty booth, as it turned out. No big, we thought. We are pretty easygoing - just the seats were dirty and the table appeared clean. Our server was friendly. However, my menu had a big glop of mayo on two of the inside pages and as I looked around the restaurant it reminded me of a dirty diner or something and not a newer restaurant. The carpet was dirty and lots of debris and food was littered about, many tables were haphazardly left half uncleaned, and the people who were seated all seemed to be flagging down waitstaff... not good signs. Our food came out quickly and the order was correct, but I noticed a hair on my tomato pretty much immediately. I set that aside and dove in to th burger only to find another hair cooked into my sautéed mushrooms. I decided I should let the manager know, but he never came by. Finally told the server and made it clear I didn't want a replacement or discount or anything, just wanted them to know about the problem since two hairs had made it into one burger which seemed to me to be indicative of a problem in the kitchen. I had eaten a lot of my burger by the time I found the second hair and certainly didn't want a free meal or a replacement meal. However, the waitress came back and said the manager was glad we said something and insisted to take the hairy burger off the check. The manager also came over to apologize before we left. I felt like that was very kind and appropriate and I appreciated the way it was handled. If the only problem had been a hairy burger, I wouldn't have even mentioned it, as problems happen sometimes even when everyone is trying their best.  So, why two stars? Honestly, I don't think I have ever been to a Red Robin that deserved five stars - it always feels like a chain trying to be cool with flair galore. I think the food, atmosphere, etc. at Red Robin is usually a three or four star experience at best. The fact pretty much every part of our dining experience had some sort of issue makes me very weary to give this location another try. The combo of no host to greet us, an unclean overall feeling in the restaurant, and hairy food isn't really something I will want again ... even if the service and handling of a problem was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4?start=20,,,,,

The waiter was very curt and unhelpful. Fries were mushy and the burger I ordered (garden) was pretty tasteless. The entire time this weird repetitive music was blasting driving my entire table crazy. To top it off was the little kiosk thing on the table. I've seen them before but never to this level. It cut out almost all need for actual human interaction and was very irritating. No real bill was given, you had to pay on the kiosk which had many steps and was very confusing. There was no option for a real bill, the waiter would just come over to help but even then you had to send out a notification because no one was around to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4?start=20,,,,,

The one of the newer Red Robin at Winrock is decent. We went with the kids and it was pretty crowded and got seated fairly quickly. The manager was very nice, courteous and attentive. Our waiter just seemed like he was in such a rush that he didn't really listen but after asking for a second or third time for something he was apologetic and respectful. We had the endless fries, which used to be a large portion of fries and you'd maybe fill up twice, now they put like 10 fries in the basket and the kids munch them up, so it's like you are asking and the waiter is going back and forth with fries. Maybe ask if you want a large portion or small portion to fit your needs (i.e. two ppl vs co-workers or a family of four). We had the guacamole, salsa and chips. The guacamole was very good. The kids had the chicken tenders and pizza and fries. I had the cheese burger with green chile on the side. He had the black bacon cheeseburger. There is a tablet for the kids to play but please know you'll be charged a $1.99 fee that you don't find out about until you get the check, a little frustrating they don't tell you before hand.

Whatever you think of me, please don't assign adjectives like Discerning, Sophisticated or Tasteful to my tastebuds. Last night I opened a Red Robin menu for the first time in my life and found myself fantasizing about sodium and cheese and chicken wangs and bacon and fried things and I seriously couldn't make up my mind for about 20 minutes, it was a toss-up between about six burgers, four appetizers and, well, basically various salts. I noted that all the tables had canisters of Red Robin seasoning, a quarter teaspoon provides 13 percent of your Daily Value of sodium. Salt is cheap, plentiful, and our synapses go apesh#t for the goods. Paired with an ice cold IPA (guys, you need more local beers, please) and a football game, it's a recipe for an all-American good time.  Overall, that's what we had, a good time, and they were terrific hosts. We were celebrating the birthday of a nine year-old, and our server -- wanna say his name was Aubrey -- was completely on top of his game, he worked really hard, and put up with some kids overdosing on salt and sugar, in style. Everything I ate, including some bites of neighboring plates, tasted exactly as I anticipated.  I do need to close on this minor shrewd note. Red Robin is one of many national chains that provides, at little extra cost, video games on tabletop tablets. I'm assuming they're assuming parents like me will appreciate this. I don't, in fact, this minor provision really gets under my skin. First, for the love of food, for the love of that age-old tradition of dining together, and connecting, and getting away from our stupid electronic gadgets, please, get rid of the tablets. And for parents like us, who avidly deny our kids these devices -- especially during dinner -- man, you're making it hard for us to have conversations with our kids, because they're envious of the kids that get to zone out until the food arrives.
