Sheldon S.,"Manhattan, NY",553,189,85,3.0,6/24/2013,"Went to Friday's with a large group yesterday evening. We had an extremely large group that for the most part was accommodated well. The server was very attentive and with the exception of one person, got everyone's order correct. My food happen to be cooked (prepared and heated) very well. The meat was tender, sauces were cold (when needed to be), and rice was warmed at a decent temperature. Where as all these things may seem trivial and not needed to be mentioned, I've had many very different experiences at Fridays. Now that my last visit to the franchise has been positive, perhaps the universe will stop placing me in situations where I'm surrounded with people who seemingly continuous to have me eating at Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4382,1179,825,3.0,3/5/2013,"I'm sure that near the end of every week millions of people can be heard to say ""TGI Friday!""  I'm certain that 99.99% of them are not talking about this chain. These folks would never ever be a destination restaurant for me.  It's just a place to grab something while the lovely wife trashes our charge cards at the mall.  So I was there on Sunday and sat at the bar.  The bartender was fine.  My drink was fine.  I ordered the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  It cost me about $10.  It had too much dressing but otherwise it was spicy and fine. When I go here I don't have a good time but I don't have a bad time either.  I just have a time.  So I'll give them three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282,2.0,3/21/2012,"You don't go to Friday's to get anything special.  You go there when they have a deal like 2 for $10 such as right now.  At least this cheapskate does.   The food is what it is.  Like every other chain restaurant, it isn't bad but it isn't great.  The Dragonfire Chicken is neither fiery, nor is it particularly dragony.  It was a very colorful name for a very bland dish.  The chicken tortilla soup was better.   Service at the bar was quick.  I do believe the bartenders pay a little more attention to the people with alcoholic drinks.  The people next to me were offered refills on their drinks while I was ignored (I didn't even want another one, I just decided to test them to see if they would notice).   Meh describes it perfectly.  But you couldn't beat the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1699,31,3.0,8/3/2013,"It's your standard TGI Friday's with the typical food offerings.  My balsamic-grilled chicken caesar and spinach flatbread were decent, and the $10 price was great.  The chicken itself was tender and the balsamic glaze was a nice touch.  Dad was very happy with his Jack Daniels Burger and the accompanying fries were nice and crispy, although I did have to add a sprinkle of salt.  Our server was very sweet and it didn't take TOO long for us to get our food, but we definitely had to wait a good 10-15 min. for it to arrive.  Otherwise, it's a solid-enough option at the KOP Mall for a sit-down fast-food style meal when you want something other than the food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,4.0,2/23/2012,Came here for an Valentine's Day dinner with a friend. There was no wait since we sat in the bar area. Our bartender/server Lauren was a lot of fun (plus she remembered me from a previous visit).  The drinks were good and strong and the food was good as well. 4-stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Nancy P.,"New York, NY",364,583,233,1.0,3/10/2011,"Such slow service and long wait time for a table, only to receive mediocre food.  Our server told us that we could only get burgers well done, according to township regulations?  Just sounds like an excuse for poor quality beef.. We also got the fried green beans; they were probably the better part of the meal..only cause of the wasabi ranch sauce. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Liz F.,"Philadelphia, PA",220,248,2,2.0,11/26/2012,"Two stars mostly because I sat facing a picture on a wall that clearly had printed ""signiture here"" WHAT!  Learn to spell, people.  You're really adding to the problem of our spelling impaired, auto-correct, spell check dependent youth.  I wanted to take a picture but two women sat down and I didn't want them to think I was crazy.  It's on the same wall as the bathroom, up by the bar.  See for yourself.  Fridays is your typical family suburban fare.  There's nothing extraordinary, just a lot of fried calories.  We got some blackberry long islands that were pretty delicious. Service was good.  Everyone was very nice and food came out fast.  My friend left his credit card at the restaurant and got it back without any problems. Not a bad spot if you're in a pinch at the KOP mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Deena S.,"King of Prussia, PA",21,41,,4.0,1/26/2013,"Thank you Friday's, for your awesome customer service and a nice cold beer when a girl needs one :) the reason I'm giving it four stars is because the fruit flies.. they're kind of swarming around the bar area.. they are harmless but such a turn off.. plus, not an issue you want to have while trying to watch a game",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Jane O.,"Sterling, VA",118,37,27,2.0,11/25/2012,I was a little disappointed after my visit to this Fridays. I went on the Monday of Veterans Day weekend.  I'm not sure if management was not aware that it would be so busy or if they just didn't have enough staff but for whatever reason service was SSSOOOOOO slow!  We had a 10 minute wait to be seated but that wasn't a problem.  But after we were seated and placed our drink order it took about another 10-15 minutes for our margaritas to come out.  Our appetizer and the kids food was the only thing that came out at a decent time.  But the rest of us had to wait.  It took over 40 minutes to get our food and since we were with kids they started getting fussy so we had to take our food to go. I will say the manager did give us a discount on our bill for the long wait The spicy queso dip was very yummy!!! I do recommend you try it.  Our petite sirloins were still good after having to reheat it at home.  I'm a big fan of Fridays food so I would go back to eat but I don't think Id go to this specific location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Wayne S.,"Bridgeport, PA",1,3,1,2.0,11/24/2012,"Just finished my meal would rather eat at the food court.   Appetizers, pot stickers, were burnt and I sent them back.  My chicken bruschetta  was luke warm what a waste of $100.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3266,2340,17975,3.0,2/21/2008,"Came here for a happy hour (marking my second time here, other than for lunch) and my experience was quite positive. Their drink specials are decent. We ordered several rounds of kamikaze shots (special; $5/shot). One of our bartenders made me a few Tequila Sunrises (they look precisely like sunrises), and it was the first time I've ever seen those in shot-form (special; $7/shot). Our bartenders, Rob and Julie, helped us with speed and a smile. Their friendly attitudes helped: when someone commented on a dessert's appearance, Julie joked that she baked it and that it took awhile to do so. Not a fan of T.G.I. Friday's food. I've been here many times for lunch. Each time I eat here, I'm unimpressed and slightly disgusted with their average-to-foul fare. But hey, go sit at the bar and knock back a few.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
James S.,"Harleysville, PA",159,491,497,3.0,1/12/2012,"I consider Friday's to be the nice version of Applebee's.  Similar food, but I think the quality is noticeably better.  This Friday's isn't half bad.  It's located in the King of Prussia Mall, so the area is a plus.  This side of the mall doesn't get as crowded for parking, which is another bonus.  They always have some kind f special in the menu like 3 courses for $16, 3 courses for $12, or 2 courses for $10.  Long list of appetizers, which I love.  The Jack Daniels menu is awesome.  Friday's won't blow anyone away, but I like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Melissa G.,"King of Prussia, PA",2,50,,1.0,6/8/2011,"Last time Justin flew into Philly, we decided to go to TGIF for dinner at the King of Prussia mall.  It was a Thursday, and we were fairly sure it'd be empty.  What a mistake!  We had to wait for a table, which I don't object to because, hey, it's the King of Prussia mall!  UGH! Once we had ordered, however, a party of 10 or so followed us in.  Our server proceeded to completely ignore us for them all night, not refill drinks, not ask if we wanted dessert, nothing!   No bueno!  Also, it was intolerably loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Nick B.,"Fairfax, VA",103,260,16,5.0,7/30/2011,"Call me crazy for giving this place 5 stars. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, here's why I've rated it as such: Almost EVERY single time I've been here, I've gotten good service. Whether it's at the bar, or in the dining area, service has been quick, accurate and most servers are generally pleasant. Recently I discovered the bar here, and service has been great. I've been to some bars where you are simply ignored, but not here. The bartenders make sure you are taken care of. (Plus, if you're a Give Me More Stripes member, you get free chips and salsa!

Jen D.,"West Chester, PA",118,5,,2.0,9/14/2013,"Although the food is good, the service here is horrible. Want a beer? Better be ready to wait a half hour.

Will D.,"King of Prussia, PA",7,266,45,1.0,5/11/2010,"Two words: Horrible service.  I eat out frequently, and had one of the worst service experiences of my life at the TGI Friday's in King of Prussia.  The staff was not at all interested in helping us.  I would never return to this restaurant.

Philip L.,"King of Prussia, PA",18,22,,1.0,6/20/2011,"Tried to eat here on a Monday night. A Monday night for God's sake. Arrived to find a bunch of people milling about in the lobby, I put our name in and was told 30 to 35 minutes despite the preponderance of empty tables within sight.

I used to go because my friend dates one of the waitresses and we would always get the hook up with drinks. But now they changed managers and that don't fly anymore. The one bartender lady is weak, as in she can't make a drink if her mother's brother's sister's life was on the line.

Chris D.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,6,,1.0,8/30/2012,"Went to Fridays for a burger and fries for lunch. How in the world do you mess that up! I'm so tired of restaurants serving cold food. I ordered the Angus cheeseburger and my wife ordered the Jack Daniels burger which looked nothing like the tv commercial.  My burger was cold, my wife's burger was Luke warm with a stale bun. The beef patties looked like the patties you buy in the store and taste the same.  We were really shocked how bad the food went down hill since our last visit a year ago. Fridays was always our ""go to"" spot for a quick lunch or late night snack. Not anymore, such a shame...   On a positive note the waitress asked if everything was ok and I told her about the burgers. She was willing to have them make a new hot one for me and take it off the receipt but I declined since we were pressed for time.   Our waitress notified the manager who apologized and took the burgers off our receipt. So we ended up just paying for our spinach dip and 2 sodas which totaled $15.  The manager was nice but i had the feeling that she didn't blame us for not wanting to eat the food.  Sorry but i can't recommend Fridays as a ""Go to"" spot anymore...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia
Emily A.,"Montrose, CA",260,168,11,2.0,1/15/2009,"I met a friend for lunch here last week. Need I say...his choice?  Not a great place to go if you are dieting, because there is absolutely nothing on the menu that is healthy or as we say in Weight Watchers, low points. With that fat guy from the food channel as their new spokesperson, it is a downright scary thought. Heavy cream and rich sauce on everything fried. Someone should do a documentary on TGIFatsos.  On the upside, the place was clean and the waitstaff friendly. I guess I am just bashing the overall chain of Fridays for not even trying to offer healthy alternatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia?start=20
matt d.,"Morrisville, PA",3,9,,3.0,8/8/2010,"I believe they know of their poor service reviews.  Last night I called ahead and was told that they do not do reservations but when we arrived they had a table for 7 ready for us anyway.  Throughout the meal I felt that the server, the manager, and the bussers were extremely courteous and made sure we had everything we needed.  The manager made his rounds and also asked about our satisfaction.  I can't say much for the food, it is a chain restaurant after all, but it is right on par.   One thing to note is that if you use a GPS to get there, the restaurant is actually a part of the mall between JCPenny and Sears. 160 N Gulph Rd will not get you where you need to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-king-of-prussia?start=20
Robyn H.,"Philadelphia, PA",449,463,54,1.0,9/13/2009,"""Ugh!!!"" Is all I can say!!  This place just reminded me of why I HATE chain restaurants!!!!!!  We ordered their ""Sizzling Shrimp and Chicken"", which is normally pretty good! (At ANY OTHER FRIDAY'S, that is!!) THIS Friday's, for some reason, has a major CHEESE FETISH!! They went TOTALLY overboard on the cheese. They threw mounds of cheese on our entree, to the point where my stomach was GURGLING after the first few bites! (I'm not kidding!) They even put a pound or so of cheese in our mashed potatos!  (Which is USUALLY good, but not when you overdo it like this place did.) By the way, I checked the menu, and the potatos are not even supposed to come with cheese, so I guess the cook thought he was ""hooking us up!"" LOL So, to make a long story short... I stopped eating it. I had a whole plate of chicken and potatos left when the waitress came back. When I told her how disgusting my food was, she offered to take TWO DOLLARS off of my meal. (Oh, how GRACIOUS of her! LOL) So, I left the restaurant feeling pissed and hungry!  Funny, I have had their Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp a million times, but I will never order it again because of this horrible dining experience.
