4,Larry T.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",0,80,,2.0,2012-03-30,"On the way back to FL, road fatigue was setting in so I picked this exit for an overnight stay based on the choice of hotels and restaurants.  Across from the Hampton where I was staying (that's another story!) is a Chilis.  OK, I was always fond of their tequila lime chicken breast and they make decent margaritas, so let's give it a go.  Restaurant is crowded including the booths at the bar area but the bar is fairly open.  Bar keep is also waiting tables which is never a good sign when busy, but he gets to me fairly quick.  I have a top shelf Margarita.  Tasty but served in a small glass for $9 bucks.  No wonder they don't put drink prices on the menu!  Anyway, ordered my fave and he says kitchen is backed up.  No problem: no where to go and I'll switch to $3 drafts and watch some B'Ball.  Salad comes with no problem; getting an extra dressing was a problem.  That was a 10 minute ordeal.  When the food finally arrives it looks like dog food.  A char grilled breast floating on a sea of watery black beans, mixed with rice and soggy chips.  This is a non starter.  I ask to speak with the manger but she's in back helping to cook!  I decide to swap this for a steak with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Another long wait.  Steak arrives and manager says she will be right back with bread.  Never see her again!  To my surprise, the steak was cooked as requested and was tender but had been heavily seasoned (to be expected at these chains).  Still good and the sides were well prepared so you get a two.  By this time I've lost track of time and (beers) and I'm ready to chill out in my room and for this ordeal the bar tender comped me a beer!   So, if you're traveling on I65 and you want to make a stop either for overnight or dinner, I would advise you to push on to the next exit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale?start=20,,,,,
3,Ashley M.,"Birmingham, AL",114,367,563.0,2.0,2012-04-11,"The poor rating is solely based on the poor service we always receive. I've always liked the menu selection and most of the time love the food, but the service is always horrible. But it stays crowded so apparently not everyone feels that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale?start=20,,,,,

0,Steve E.,"Antioch, CA",5,26,,1.0,2014-02-13,"Last night Birmingham was hit by a snow storm. Five of us made it back to the hotel after a long day, looking for a hot meal. Almost all restaurants in the area were dark, but Chile's beckoned with cars in the parking lot and televisions glowing. Wait - the doors are locked?! The man inside gestured ""no"", but wouldn't speak.  Sent us away into the night. Thanks for nothing,  Chile's.  :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale?start=20,,,,,
21,Brittany F.,"Nashville, TN",129,235,79.0,2.0,2014-03-16,"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for a quick meal of soup and salad. It was not a quick meal at all. They were busy but not crazy busy when we got there, only on about a 5 minute wait, which was nice. Service was okay; the waitress was training someone and had more tables than she probably should have on such a busy day. She did the best she could given the circumstances.  The food is why this location is getting such a low rating. All 3 of us at the table ordered the same thing, soup and salad. That order is usually is very fast and good. It took about 15 minutes before the waitress told us the soup was ready but not the salad and if we wanted to get our soup. Totally okay with that coming out first so we went ahead and got our soup. We finished and then waited to get salad...it took about 30 minutes from sitting down to finally get a side Caesar salad and when it came out it just wasn't that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
17,Stephanie B.,"Nashville, TN",63,2,13.0,3.0,2014-05-27,"Overall an average experience. Server was nice but could have been a little faster in his service. My husband & I got the 2 for $20 deal. We had the Texas Cheese Fries for an appetizer. For the meal I ate the Cajun Chicken Pasta (normally a miss at other Chili restaurants) and it was fantastic! My husband got the Bacon Chicken Ranch Quesadillas, which tasted fine but my hubby struggled to find any chicken and didn't taste the ranch. He would have gone with the chicken crispers had he known it would have turned out like that. Also some of his silverware was dirty, so watch out for that. We were also intrigued by Chili's new touchscreen tablets at each table. It's a neat concept as it includes menu information, jukebox, games & apps (for a fee of course), but we mostly liked the ability to pay at the end of the meal so we didn't have to wait for the server. Very convenient. Random commentary: one of their TV's had the lifetime movie network on. Don't know why they think their guests would want to watch that. The other TV's I saw had TNT and Fox News. Those I get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
24,Robinskii G.,"West Covina, CA",33,77,430.0,1.0,2014-07-05,"So far....4:42pm sitting at the table for after 6 mins a server still has not even come to our table to take our drink order.  Pressed the call server button on this electronic kiosk sitting on every table. Still no one has come. But workers are walking by just staring at us.   Finally!!! 5:56 After 10additional mins, (by now i was ready to get up and leave.) A waiter walked passed and asked if we been helped! My response. NOPE!  He takes  our drink and food orders, and says he'll just be serving us today, way to step up!! You get a star for stepping up.   Drinks come.... no straws...hmm.  5:06 appetizer comes out, no plates. Flag down the server again... ask for plates, he comes back with dirty ones, asked if he can get a clean one, he says ""sorry I didn't see that"".... I didn't know if you grabbed plays from a clean pile you have to ""see"" it.  5:21 food comes out.... it's room temp. my husband got the chipotle chicken bowl. Its loaded with rice and cheese... so disappointing. I got the chicken cajun pasta, it has never failed me at other locations.... I couldn't take a second bite how salty it was.  Over all experience... poor! I really love chili's too. One of my favorite restaurants. But this location has failed me.  Only uplifting thing about this place was being able to check out at the table. Which was the fastest this evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
22,Dana N.,"Kentwood, LA",1,4,,1.0,2015-04-12,"Bartender waited on us and had a very short snooty tone throughout our entire meal. She acted as if we were inconveniencing her....not to mention food was horrible.  Tacos were so dry they weren't edible until u doused them with sour cream and salsa, also...triple dipper was brought out cold and dry as hell also.  Hard to find a chilis worth a flip anymore:/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
23,Howell L.,"Gardendale, AL",0,14,7.0,1.0,2015-04-29,VERY SLOW service. My wife's food was cold.

16,Neoview N.,"Birmingham, AL",2,6,126.0,3.0,2015-07-26,"My visit to Chili's was surprisingly nice. We took advantage of the 2 can eat for $20 promotion. We started out with the onion ring appetizer and got an order of the eg grills. They were both tasty and we got them fast. We had the Cajun chicken pasta and the mango chicken. Both were pretty good. The margaritas were decent - they went a little heavy on the salt on the second round though. Overall, a good experience at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
10,Brian M.,"Indianapolis, IN",123,350,856.0,1.0,2015-07-27,"We were traveling and decided to stop here on the way - that was a big mistake.  In a nutshell this place had the following features: 1. Slow to get drink 2. Nothing for kids to do while we waited - okay, not everyone does, but it took forever and a day to get the food. 3. We ordered tacos, pizza, quesadilla - the menu left off the part about them being covered in grease. To top it - the Server forgot us, we found that she decided to take a walk - she was in front smoking.  I had to get our drinks for her...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
19,Pamela W.,"Platte City, MO",0,1,,1.0,2016-01-01,"So you order a drink that is posted on the menu.  Drink is received and is not the item ordered.  I had to go to the bar myself as the waitress hadn't been back by the table.  The bartender says that it is the drink I ordered but they are out of Sprite so she substituted pineapple juice...In what universe is pineapple juice a substitute for Sprite?  Food items were served cold and overcooked.  If New Year's Eve is going to put your restaurant in such sad shape on New Year's Day, you may as well just lock the doors instead of serving garbage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,

12,Carolyn O.,"Hamilton, OH",47,20,29.0,1.0,2016-03-24,"If I actually took the time to describe in its entirety how horrible this Chilis is, I would have to write a novel. So here is the Cliff notes version. If you live here, go somewhere else. If, like us, you are stopping here on your way to vacation, go somewhere else. If a friend or family member insists on eating here, go in with extremely low expectations. I cannot express the low expectations enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
8,Colecia T.,"Kissimmee, FL",84,45,45.0,3.0,2016-05-14,"We stopped here to get something to eat after a wedding. It wasn't my first choice but I was starving. I had the taco trio ....my choice was the shrimp, prime rib, & fish.  The shrimp taco was full of flavor I loved it! The fish taco was bland I've had better. No for the prime rib it was so juicy and tender omg I could've had another one!!! The black beans which wasn't black beans was topped with pico salsa was delicious as well.  I'll definitely visit this location again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
14,Timothy M.,"Graysville, AL",10,1,,1.0,2016-05-25,Worst experience ever!! Went on a Wednesday night it was not busy at all.

20,S D.,"Dora, AL",0,10,,1.0,2016-06-18,Chillis Restraunt has completely went downhill. I ordered a grilled chicken salad and the chicken was slimy and cold. You can tell they use cheap frozen chicken. My mother got the grilled chicken pasta and it was also cold. When we told the waiter he even said yeah we just had another customer sent theirs back for the same thing. My wife got chicken quesadillas and they appeared to be setting a while and also had the frozen slimy chicken in them. I will have to say the chips and salsa were really good because that's all I ate. We waited 40 minutes on our food so we were thinking at least it will be fresh... We were wrong. I will not ever go back due to the poor food quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
18,Johnny M.,"Birmingham, AL",0,9,,1.0,2016-09-08,"We had the Fajita. The tortillas were cold, the container that they come in was filthy. I didn't even want to touch it without a napkin. The food was not good. The carnitas was warmed up in a microwave. This is the first time that I have ever visited a Chilies and it will probably be a last. The waitress was very good but the place was mostly empty. I wish that I had checked Yelp before going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
11,Greg H.,"Huntsville, AL",47,5,8.0,1.0,2017-03-03,Didn't take longer then 5 minutes to decide to leave. Hostess staff was not helpful and not very professional. Whole store was dirty.

9,David P.,"Clarksville, TN",55,9,2.0,1.0,2017-03-12,"This is the WORSE Chili's in the country.  Chicken served raw.  I left hungry, my wife's chicken was raw.  We both left without eating our meals.  AVOID THIS PLACE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
13,Nafesa A.,"Birmingham, AL",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-25,"Definitely one of the worst Chilis locations I've ever been to. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out and on top of that the orders were wrong. We decided to order dessert hoping that it would end the terrible food off on a good note.... But even the cookie skillet was bad. When the waiter brung the cookie skillet to the table he didn't bring any spoons so we had to wait another five minutes for him to bring them over. When we got the spoons they were filthy with food still stuck to them, when we asked for new utensils the waiter proceeded to roll his eyes and had us wait another five minutes. At this point we were ready to leave and proceeded to pay for our bill which became another issue because the waiter was very unprofessional and made us walk over to him instead of coming to the table to get the payment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,,,,,
7,Carrie C.,"Fultondale, AL",6,4,4.0,1.0,2017-07-22,We went in and waited for 10 minutes and decided to walk out. No one said hello how are you. Didn't take our drink order.

6,Jason A.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,31,,1.0,2017-11-20,"We had driven to Birmingham to pick up a piece of furniture on Sunday.  On the way back, we pulled into Full Moon BBQ at 11:00 but the lines were just too long, so we detoured to Chili's.  My friend was from out of the country, so I thought it ok to let him try the chain. Not surprisingly, less than a block from the BBQ place, we found Chili's nearly empty.  Four or five tables had two people each at them, and the music was blaring too loud as always to imply some happening joint instead of letting mostly senior adults hear their own dinner conversations.  We were seated immediately and our host left.  I interpreted the menu to my friend and he left to wash his hands.  I waited for our server to bring cutlery, and to take drink orders, or bring water, anything to acknowledge our arrival.  I waited.  And waited.  Finally, I stood up, like a Meerkat sentinel, and scanned the room.  No servers.  Two in the bar.  One chatting with the host.  None with the diners.   I could see into the kitchen somewhat.  Two bellied up to the counter and waiting. None on the floor.   I stood for some minutes.  Nothing. Went to the host station to ask where our server was.  He sent one right over.  It was Frank, the young guy chatting with them.  Frank was great.  He was right there, polite, responsive, if a little inexperienced.  Frank deserves your tips.  I tipped him well. We ordered a thee-meat BBQ combination, also their chips and queso.   While waiting for the meal, the silverware arrived.  They were borderline filthy, slopped through an industrial dishwasher and coated with a film of sludge that had to be wiped off to see the metal again.  Ick.  The queso and chips arrived.  Very good.  But, there was a scoop of guacamole in the dip, sitting there.  Had never seen that before.  Tried it.  The scoop was literally putrid.  Called Frank back over.  Strongly encouraged him to go to the kitchen to taste the guacamole himself.  He came back apologetic and said it had soured and they were making more.  His inexperience kept him from instantly removing ours, but we had a full dinner coming so didn't want to wast another dip we couldn't eat.  The meal was fine, but the ticket came and they had not taken the queso off.  I politely asked him to ask the manager to do so.  It was.  No comps, just the removal of what was inedible.  Franks was very nice.   On the way out, we weren't spoken to as we passed the host station. He was busy, head down, texting away a personal message on his phone. Chili's is trying to cutback service by promoting the table-top video interfaces.  They have succeeded marvelously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fultondale,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
