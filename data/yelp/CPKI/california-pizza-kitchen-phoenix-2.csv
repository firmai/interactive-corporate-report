Ryland B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,22,2.0,8/13/2017,"I live one minute from CPK and decided to get a to-go order for my friend and I.  The woman placing the order was very nice and professional, I waited the appropriate amount of time and pulled up to the restaurant lots of to-go parking that's a plus I decided not to call the number and have them bring it out to my car, it was a Saturday and I assumed they were busy (I assumed wrong) I was trying to be considerate and not make them rush it out to my car.  Waiting at the to-go station and waiting and waiting employees are looking at me but no one is acknowledging me.  They are not busy and I am standing at the to-go desk with my credit card tapping on the counter and employees keep looking at me, exactly what do they think I am there for? To admire the decor and 90's yellow tile? After about 6 minutes I am getting really angry.  I finally went to the host station because they weren't busy no one was flocking into this establishment in droves.  I asked ""is anyone there to get my order?"" The host went to get someone, ironically the person who came over to help me finally was one of the ones who had been starring in my direction for the past 8 minutes.  I almost lost it when the electronic tab asked me if I wanted to leave a tip, ""here's a tip pay attention"". The pizza it was good the appetizer good but $30 and feeling annoyed, next time I'll spend 1/3 of that buy it at the grocery store and heat it up at home.  I feel like a lot of reviews are in reference to their service over the past few years here's tip #2 read reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=20

Dominic C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,16,2,1.0,6/29/2016,"This review is for service received on June 24th. We put our name on the list in order to get in ""line"" for a table ahead of arriving at the restaurant. When my wife and I arrived, we were seated by the assistant manager. We let her know that we had three more in our party. My wife and I ended up waiting an hour and our dining companions never showed up.  It turns out that they arrived a few minutes before us and were seated on the far back side of the restaurant. We weren't able to get in touch with them because the adult of the other party had a phone that was dead.  As we waited for the other party, we just decided to order the appetizers and entrees. I ordered a steak done medium well. When it arrived, the outside was super over-done and the inside was raw. Lastly, the waiter who was taking care of us had another table with 15 people and we were pretty much ignored except for when he brought the food.   Thanks to the CPK and a lack of staff coordination, a long drive from Tucson to meet friends for dinner resulted in the terrible outcome. I am not returning to any of these franchises... this should not have happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=20

Nan R.,"Prescott, AZ",0,22,2,1.0,6/18/2017,"Nightmare on Camelback and 24th Street!  I have frequented this restaurant since I can remember and even have the phone number memorized since the 80s. What a disappointment.  When three other restaurants in the vicinity had a 40+ minute wait due to Father's Day, this store was empty. Maybe four tables were occupied. We found a nice spot and proceeded to order a glass of wine. After waiting 15 minutes and told the wine would arrive anytime on 4 different occasions, the waitress said they were looking for a wine glass. Really??? There were maybe 10 people in the restaurant over 21. So we proceeded to order our food not having the wine delivered.  After waiting an obnoxiously long time our food finally arrived as did the wine. We were told they had to wash the wine glass. The split pea and tortilla soups were coagulated beyond a stew and not edible! The wonton chicken and avocado wraps were horrible at best and tasted even worse than they appeared and my ""go-to"" half barbecue chicken chopped salad  was disgusting. What happened CPK?  What happened to the high energy vibe, shiny clean environment, efficient staff and consistent food?  I couldn't even find a manager after asking for one. After decades, I will never go back to the barn styled restaurant with disgusting food and underwhelming staff. Bye bye CPK!i",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=20

I don't know if the times caught up to, and passed this restaurant chain, but it is good to redefine yourself every so often. I will say this location made huge strides changing the decor inside. Thai crunch chicken salad keeps me coming back. One of these days I need to do a nutrition check on that salad.......... Shit, just did a quick nutrition check in the middle of my review. Damn, 1400 calories! Well, I usually don't eat the whole thing or use the dressing, but wow, are there any greens in that salad?

Debbie T.,"Medinah, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/3/2016,Went to the scotsdale rd location a few days ago.  When we were seated I noticed a very bad odor immediately.  I went to the hostess and asked to be seated away from location.  The next booth wasn't quite as bad.  After we we're done eating the table next to us was being cleaned off because the people had left. There again was that horrible spoiled dirty smell.  It was then I knew the bus man was using a very dirty contaminated rag to clean all the fables.  As we left I ask where the manager was and the hostess said he was at the back of the restaurant.  So I told her to Inform him of the problem.  I should have told him myself.  So needless to say I was very disappointed .  I go to the Chicago location and have never had a problem.  .  Don't think I could go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=60

My wife ordered a Cranberry Cooler drink, with free refills and asked if she could try a different flavor, they said sure. When we got the bill, they overcharged us with an extra drink. We have done this at other restaurants, so the waitress told is she would get it removed. Then comes back and says the manager said he wouldn't remove it, so I asked to speak to the manager. I explained that we were never told it would be an extra charge and we've also done this at other restaurants with no problems. Victor the manager argued with me instead of being apologetic. I asked him who his manager was and he insisted that he was THE Manager. I asked again and he said J.R.

Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be. I guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things.

The drinks left a little to be desired, but a few tweaks and they are good. I'm very disappointed they got rid of their tiramasu because that was the reason I selected to go to that restaurant.

It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea. We got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did.  The manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one.  The server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways.

The one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent. The service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=100

I was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge. She said she could not do that. No substitutions. So, I asked ""why?"" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference. Her reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people. Huh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices? I tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.

I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it.  What really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server ""not liking her."" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!

The BBQ Chicken Pizza won over droves of pizza fans. Quickly, the Thai pizza caught on and CPK became quickly initialized in American culture like KFC, PTA and FYI.

Jennifer A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,2.0,12/7/2014,"My Husband and I were visiting Phoenix from Vancouver, Canada. We were looking around for places to have dinner, and we saw California Pizza Kitchen. We had never been here and decided to give it a try. We ordered a bowl of soup, Mac and cheese, as well as the Jambalaya to share. We told our server we wanted the Mac and cheese (Appetizer, not even realizing there was a main dish portion as well). He did not bother clarifying with us which one we were referring to. When the order arrived, we were surprise at the large size and made a comment to our server that this is a big portion, and that we thought it would be a smaller size. He said that this is the usual size, and did not bother clarifying that it was not the appetizer we had requested. When our bill came, we were surprised to see that the Mac and cheese had costed us $11 as opposed to $3.99 as stated in the appetizer section. We then informed our server of the mistake and miscommunication, and he agreed and went to rectify the miscommunication. Although this mistake happened, please note, we weren't at all upset at the server. We completely understood mistakes and miscommunications happen, and he had kind enough customer service skills to rectify the situation by changing our bill amount. The part that we were dissatisfied and very surprised by, was the actions of the manager on duty this evening (December 7th, around 8.30pm). This complaint is towards the manager. When the server when to correct the bill, the manager (or we think it was the manager) came out to our table and rudely asked 'what's going on, guys??'. We politely explained to her the situation, and she responded by saying, and I quote, 'so you want to eat the large size Mac and cheese, pack it (we did not finish it), and only pay for the appetizer Mac and cheese??'. We were so offended by her statement, and disbelief in her lack of customer service skills. We left our leftover Mac and cheese that we had packed on the table as we were so upset by this., and promptly left the premise upon paying for our bill. She did not even apologize for her tone and rudeness, or mistake in the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=100

One day a client brought me an amazing huge salad that impressed me...and inspired me to go alone for lunch on another day. I stopped in in work clothes (workout gear & a bun). They were so polite at the front. They asked if I had been there before and I answered no. Well they welcomed me like they had been expecting me! My salad was filling and just as good as the first I had. With many other options to choose from. I was impressed by the menu. Why have I deprived myself for so long?  As I am eating, a man I presume to be a manager comes over to say ""hi"" and that he had heard I had never eaten there before, greeted me, asked what I thought of the place and food and wished me well.

Bill B.,"Phoenix, AZ",221,310,6,2.0,10/27/2012,"Why does this place still exist? Back when Sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this: ""There was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was 'Sizzler'"".  Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared. CPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question. The pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey. For all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price. It's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.

Every food I have tried at CPK has been nothing but yummy, but this waiter really ruins the dining experience. I give the food 5 stars, but I give my experience at this place 2 stars, all because this particular waiter screws up our orders consistently. One time, we ask for the bread..the bread never comes out, just our meals.  another time, I ask for extra sauce on the side of my salad, never came out another time, I asked for no peanuts in my salad - it was filled with peanuts this last time was the topper -  ordered an appetizer, and it never arrived. I also asked for no tortilla strips in my soup - it comes out loaded with tortilla strips. And when we got our bill at the end of lunch, we told him that our appetizer never came out because we wanted to make sure we didn't get charged for it, and he pulled out the order he had written and confirmed that it wasn't even written down! it's the same guy EVERY time - I don't know how this guy still works there and why I keep being the unfortunate one always falling into his area, but I am not dining at this location anymore - much too stressful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=80

All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like: I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza.  While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, ""Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro."" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, ""No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!"" To which I replied, ""Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza."" To which he replied, ""Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,"" as he walked away. I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted.

Evan B.,"Tempe, AZ",262,546,1811,3.0,2/5/2010,"Neither great, nor bad I think that is how all chains get 3 stars. Their menu is craftily made by a test kitchen making sure not to offend any pallet. In the process they don't  seduce anyone mouth either. I frequently had lunches delivered from here to meetings, and I also dined in the restaurant too.  For delivery I quickly learned to stay away from anything with a dough component, from egg rolls to pizza it was always Luke warm and soggy by time I sunk my teeth in to it. One of my preferred dishes for both delivery and in store dining is the Thai Linginni. It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix. However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me.  This is also one of the cheaper items on the menu. I have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter. As for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a ""mushroom pesto"" that is quite earthy and greasy.  Included with a meal is bread and butter, the Italian bread here is fairly good with firm crust and airy body.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=80

Management took the feedback seriously and appear to have made some changes since last visit. This time we ordered the tortilla soup and baked potato soup. I'm not usually a fan of potato soups, but we would definitely order it again!  We ordered our favorite avocado rolls which I have to say these were the best ones we had to date and better than last time - they were incredibly fresh and vibrant.  My husband ordered the Thai pizza. I'm usually a traditional style pizza lover, but had a taste and have to say it was surprisingly amazing. It reminds me of chicken satay on pizza. I ordered the works which was delicious! Lots of oregano and veggies and meat. The crust was perfect and crispy and light on both pizzas. We really wanted to get to dessert, but didn't even make it through the pizzas. Leftover CPK pizza is the best. Our waiter this time was phenomenal, his name is Joel, make sure you get him.

Other notes: When I got to the place and looked at other people's review, it did kind of made me feel like I need to check what's in my food. Some helpers have posted pics with bugs in their food. To be honest, sometimes things do fly into our food from the kitchen to the dining area. If a simple costumer service can take care of that then it shouldn't be an issue or have the service fix the issue.

Isabel M.,"Phoenix, AZ",121,1,,1.0,9/5/2017,"By far the RUDEST customer service at this place. The hostesss was nice and seated us , but the server anissa, was super rude and not only got the order wrong but gave us attitude for mentioning it. She failed to at least fix it or make it up. NOT once did she check up on us Without us having to wave her down and when she did she would smell like if she just took a weed smoke break, I will not be returning to this location for the POOR service received by this young girl Anissa",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2
kristy a.,"Phoenix, AZ",203,11,,5.0,4/30/2017,"Just came back from a great lunch with my boyfriend at CPK. The food was great, and the service was even better. We had 2 different servers both waiting on us, and we were never without bread or refills, and orders were taken promptly. Sebastian was one of our servers, and he was very personable. We discovered we have a lot in common with him. ;) Our female server was fantastic as well, but we didn't catch her name. We will definitely be back, and soon. Thanks for a great afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2
