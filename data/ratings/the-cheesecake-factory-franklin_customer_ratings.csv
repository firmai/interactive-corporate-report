24,Alexandra F.,"Nashville, TN",27,46,74.0,4.0,2014-11-17,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! This location was great. We had a party of 10 for a friend's birthday and the servers were very attentive. We had bread and appetizers, meals and of course cheesecake. Oh and some alcoholic drinks.  For my meal I ordered the jambalaya pasta with no green peppers, cause I hate them. I heard the server say it was the spiciest entree in the bible of a menu. Anyway, it was chicken and shrimp, onions, tomatoes, and pasta. My only complaint about this dish was that it wasn't spicy. I took about half of the dish home and added more cayenne and Cajun seasoning. Now that's what I'm talkin about. Also I had two gin and sodas that were well worth however much they cost. Smooth and strong just like I wanted. Everyone ordered something different so I observed some other superb looking dishes. The guy across from me got the chicken and a biscuit. It looked like mashed potatoes, a whole chicken, a HUGER THAN HUGE biscuit, and veggies. He said it was delicious and we heard the server say their chicken marinated for 12 hours. No wonder it's so tender!!  My friend got some kind of chicken avocado omelette. She said it was so good and it came with potatoes and toast. The birthday girl got the four cheese pasta and added chicken. Her dish was just as huge as mine and again, tasty chicken and obviously extremely cheesy.  From across the table I saw a girls huevos rancheros. She sent it back because the eggs weren't runny. I don't know if that's actually part of the dish, but it looked yum.  There was some kind of giant salad with a tower of crispy onions strings that I was jealous of. That's about all of the dishes I could see from where I was sitting. Our party of 10 was very quick to order and somehow we were there for 3 hours. So my only complaints are my dish was not spicy and it was a slow process dining here. Which was fine until we all got to a certain point of sleepy and way too full, then we all just wanted to go home. We waddled out happy though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
25,Kelly F.,"Franklin, TN",14,125,236.0,3.0,2014-12-03,"We have eaten here 3 times since it opened. The service is SLOW. Both the wait staff and the kitchen need to work out their kinks.  The food is consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, which is a good thing.  The restaurant is gorgeous. I made the mistake of ordering the special which was an Asian meatball sub from the TV show ""On the Menu"".  Just like the tasters said on the show, the bread was too hard and made it impossible to eat. The meatballs tasted like basil. Italian and Asian food are not a good mix.  The flavor profile was confusing at best. The 3 rating is due to the length it takes to order and actually get the food. I will update this review if I see an improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
95,Steve H.,"Thompson's Station, TN",1,15,1.0,2.0,2014-12-13,"My wife visited your Cool Springs location last night in Franklin. Not a good experience, sat next to a couple who was still eating their meal, we order drinks and meal. Drinks took a while, then the couple left, the table was cleaned, a new couple sat down and they rec their meal before us, asked the waitress (Paige) and she started to say they ordered Pasta, then I think realized we did too. She said she would check on our meals, kept on walking around with no feedback, finally requested a manager from a Busboy, mgt showed up and said he would check on it right away. Waitress came back and said the food was coming up.... About five minutes later it did show up, but I would think the manager would have came back and provided us with feedback. NOT a very good visit to your new restaurant. Not worth the wait to get a table or serving people out of line.  One more note, compared to the other Cheesecake Factory in Nashville, the open seating at the Franklin location did not allow for a nice dinner, loud atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=80,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

20,James S.,"Nashville, TN",0,116,5.0,5.0,2015-01-02,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, and we were excited to try this new one. There was a 15 minute wait for a table, but they would text me when the table was ready, which let us go shop a little. The inside is spectacular (nothing like the one on Big Bang Theory). Service was very prompt, friendly, and attentive. Our server knew the menu, understood customer service, and had good timing except for a lapse when it was time for the check. Food was great. I ordered the shepherd's pie, expecting something safe and pleasant, but it was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The sauce was an explosion of taste. I can't believe I'm raving about shepherd's pie, but I just did. My daughter loved the four cheese pasta. I liked the pumpernickel bread that came before the meal, though my daughter didn't think it was as soft and fresh as usual. My main complaint: When you enter the restaurant from the mall, it's utterly confusing where you're supposed to go. There's an employee work station right there, but it's not the hostess stand. It's up to you to figure out that the hostess stand is at the outside entrance, and then figure out how to get there. A sign would be nice, telling us where to go. Two lunch-size entrees, two sodas, tax, and tip totaled $40. That's a lot for lunch, but a good price for what we got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=40,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997
87,Lisa E.,"Nashville, TN",0,44,,1.0,2015-01-07,"Went for lunch and tried one of the many salmon lunch dishes.  The salmon came uncooked like I have never seen in a restaurant.  It took a while to come out and I needed to get back to the office so I ate the tasteless veggies and left the fish.  As I was leaving, I told the server that my fish was not cooked and while I didn't want anything special, I wanted her to tell the cooking team. She saw a manager close by and he came by to see the problem.  He (and she) showed appropriate concern and offered to get me something else to eat.  I didn't have time to wait yet appreciated the offer. While the fish was the biggest concern, the sides of broccoli and carrots were pretty tasteless making the full meal nasty and a waste of $15. I did grab a slice of the carrot cheesecake for a friend and it was an odd mix and nothing I would get again.  I only went there to grab the cake for a friend and won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=80,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

We called and tried to make a reservation for 18 people, some how though s group of 13 was allowed to but not us. We decided to leave after we were seated because there was an open table for 8 and then we would have waited for a Lille lone for the other 10. When we talked to the manager she spoke in a very demeaning manner and was dismissing.

36,Stacie G.,"Thompson's Station, TN",7,35,28.0,1.0,2015-01-24,"Honestly this was the WORST meal I have ever had! I have eaten at the Green Hills location and it is wonderful, this one couldn't even make a plate of pasta right. We had a 30 min seat wait (that was expected and average) once we were sat we ordered in 10 minutes, the waiter passed us off to a waitress, we waited 50 minutes for our food (a steak med rare, one med, a plate of pasta and chicken)  Food came out cold! Med steak was well done! Chicken was rubber! Spaghetti was mixed with bow tie pasta like they used the same pot to cook different pastas in the same pot. Pasta was mush!  Cheese that was melted on top was a cold congealed blob! So the end of this story is if you go to this location block out 3 hours!  30 min wait 10-20 mins to order 50 mins to get food 30 to get the food replaced/redone  45 mins to get the bill Or just decide to walk in pick up cheesecake and leave!

104,Catherine M.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,2.0,2015-01-27,"I tried this Cheesecake for lunch today with some girlfriends and ended up being somewhat disappointed. I've never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory, and I get that they're newly opened and experiencing the usual growing pains that come with that, but judging from mine and others' experiences, they have got to get it together. We had a very sweet and friendly waitress. She was attentive enough, it just sometimes took her a while, like 10 minutes to run our cards, even though the place was pretty slow, and I only saw her waiting on one other table. What makes me give this Cheesecake location 2 stars was my food. I ordered the pulled BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Seems simple enough, but when the food came out, my sandwich was giant chunks of pork with BBQ sauced slopped on top. Before the waitress walked away, I told her I thought I ordered the pulled BBQ sandwich (which I've ordered at the West Towne Cheesecake before and it was ""pulled"" like it's supposed to be). She said she thought it looked wrong and she going to make sure she didn't ring up the wrong thing. She was very nice and helpful about it, but I thought she should be able to tell if it was right or not, because I'm pretty sure they don't have a chunky pork BBQ sandwich. She came back and said that they just didn't pull it and took it back to the kitchen. Another waiter brought it back a few minutes later and the kitchen just kinda chopped up the pieces into smaller ones. I let it go at that point and just ate my food. My friend's dishes were fine. I would have appreciated a manager apologizing or a 10% off or something, my food was prepared wrong and I shouldn't have to tell them that. You can't serve pulled BBQ pork in a Southern city like Nashville, where people can get amazing BBQ all over the city and serve me what you served me, and apparently not even realize or care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=100,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

Even with appetizers and cheesecake (of course!) we cashed out just over an hour after arrival (and that includes appeasing a preschooler). I have never been a fan of the Green Hills location.

You've been warned.  If you choose to eat there (if only for food safety)  please check that your food is properly cooked, especially the chicken! This was a horrible experience.

There is extra random sauces on the food that other locations don't have, or the food is drenched in what the normal sauce is. Service has always been wonderful, atmosphere of course is wonderful.

I had friends driving almost 2 hours for dinner and knew they would not want to stay out late. I get to the restaurant at 6:30 on a Saturday night and request a table for 9. I was told the wait would be an hour and a half to 2 hours. Not knowing where else to go on short notice we all decided to wait. The restaurant was not that busy and we saw people who came after us get seated within half an hour.  Of course we spoke to who I think was a manager who apologized but did nothing else. I asked why the hostess did not at least offer us a seat at the bar to get some drinks and the manager explained that the bar is also first come first serve and that you get a seat when you can. They do not seat that area. I explained that this was our first time here and we didn't know. I also asked why they do not accept reservations since it seems like this type of situation would happen quite a bit and was told that it's just policy and they just do what they are told.  We finally get seated 2 hours after waiting outside. This is after 3 people in our party left because it was as so late. We get a very nice young man as our server and he tried very hard to get us back in a good mood. He brought us extra bread and started getting us our drinks. We all started to feel a little better, but after about 10 minutes the bread was gone and we still didn't have our drinks. We finally get our drinks and the beer was warm and the cocktails did not have enough alcohol in them.  At some point our servers changed and we ended up with a very nice young lady as our server who did a great job with us. She was very apologetic and I'm sure she was nervous to serve us because we were in such a bad mood after waiting so long for everything. We waited quite a while for our food and when it finally arrived it was all mediocre at best. We all ordered different things and not one of thought there was anything special about it.  We spoke to another manager again before leaving and again I asked why do they not accept reservations and again he said again it's first come first serve and they had more problems with parties being late and then losing their reserved table and of course getting angry.  Their policy is not first come first serve. We arrived before a lot of other smaller tables and were not first served. We all felt lied to multiple times throughout the night by staff and I feel like we should have at least gotten a free piece of cheesecake after they ruined our celebration.

91,Robin D.,"Franklin, TN",4,11,4.0,2.0,2015-09-25,"First off, let me say that my husband and I have been going there about once a week since they opened several months ago. We always sit at the bar since we always go pretty late after work and there is never a wait to sit there. Our experience always depends on who is working behind the bar. As a restaurant owner, I am very understanding that sometimes people have a hard time separating what they are going through in their personal lives from their attitudes at work and it's not always fair to judge someone on a bad day. However, last night the bartender was so rude, all we wanted to do was leave and I wish we had sooner. We came in about 10:30, not realizing that they close at 11:00. There was no one else at the bar so it was just us she had to wait on. She never welcomed us or smiled once, keeping a look of disgust on her face even when I tried to make light conversation with her. She had waited on us before so I knew a little about her history and know that she is transferring to a new store in California soon. Trying to lighten things up I said, ""you're still here, you haven't left yet?"" just curious if she was still headed to Ca. She said, ""Unfortunately, I am"" and said nothing else. My husband asked for a second drink and she took his glass poured the drink and handed it back and took off to the kitchen. My husband quickly noticed that she didn't put any ice in it so we just sat and waited, when she finally came back my husband asked if he can have ice in his $7 drink and she added ice with no apologies. After a few minutes having had my food in front of me and just a minute or so after my husband had his food she asked me if I wanted a ""small box"" for my food. I don't think she had looked at my plate because I hadn't touched it and it was a large plate of food. I said, ""not yet, are you about to close?"" to which she replied, ""We closed seven minutes ago!"". I looked at my phone and realized that it was 11:07. Even though we had just gotten our food and she just poured a glass of wine at this point I had had enough and I was ready to leave. I said, ""I am really sorry. I am not sure if you remember but we are the people that own a couple restaurants and we tip well, I didn't realize that you close at 11:00. She replied, ""I don't care at all about the tip!"" I asked her for boxes and we hurried to get out of there. Overall, it was just a bad experience. I would give it one star but that's not fair to the other bartenders there that have been really nice. Most are really nice. I don't know what we did to deserve to be treated like that. Even if we came in 10 minutes to closing I would never expect that. As restaurant owners, we gladly welcome any customers until we are closed. I am sure of the time we came in because my mother called when we were on Mallory at 10:24 PM. I wish her good luck at the new store and hopefully this was just a onetime thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.3120000000000003,2.92

63,Mary F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",30,138,220.0,2.0,2015-10-06,"I feel bad writing this review for Cheesecake Factory.  It's not a good review.  I actually really like CF. She's such a big, brash, bling-y, gaudy, over the top, almost sloppy gal of a chain. A great place to relax with a drink and apps with a loving sister after some mall shopping or with my boys before a movie. Cool sounding American fare, with adult bevs.  But, this location needs help. Fast.  I hope someone at CF will read this and do better.  CF always holds such promise and once a year, I get lulled into thinking, yes, it's possible I had an anomalous visit and that it will be different this time. It hasn't been different and my little family is done with CF for at least another year. We didn't come away enraged. Just deeply disappointed. Depressingly disappointed.  Here's why: Menus are slick with grease. Please, guys, wipe them down with soda from the bar--cheap, effective restaurant stand-by side work resource. Those menus should squeak with plastic-y cleanliness.  The discombobulated, semi-insolent, poorly trained staff at the door.  They were the first sign that something is wrong. When we visited and asked to be seated on the patio, there was confusion and no guidance. A manager came over to ask if we'd been helped--his hostesses were bungling something at the host stand. He took us outside where there were at least five tables available. The patio has its own wind tunnel that affects at least two tables. The door leading to the patio doesn't always shut properly and it blasts inside air on to the patio. And I'm talking a Kansas-sized blast. We asked to be moved. It still blasted us, but less so and once I had to get up to close the door myself. This is pure blindness to customer comfort. Don't seat those tables ever again until that wind tunnel is shut down. Unforgivable.  The staff. Sitting with guests. Too cool. Too cute to remember our order and too cool to work hard. I've seen this mistake at other CFs. If CF's target demographic is tween and twenty-somethings, I understand trying to populate with Abercrombie part-timers. But that demographic doesn't have the buying power of middle aged parents and middle aged women with girlfriends, a raging sweet tooth, and a taste for vino. But looking around at the waitstaff, and seeing this at other CFs, I think I actually realized that IS their target demographic and not my ilk.  A chain as big as CF, with its ambitious and interesting, far reaching menu should do far better with its training. It doesn't and it shows. The overloaded menu isn't enough to entice us when the wait staff are partially competent and we are stressed during dinner trying to remind them of what's missing at our table and what came out wrong (yes, we experienced all of that in one visit).  LOUD. I couldn't really hear the staff inside. Holy cow. Is the music supposed to blare like that? The restaurant is cavernous to start with. So the noise makes it seem even more so. If I'm being an old fart b/c it's supposed to blast loud music, then, okay. 'Nuff said. I claim my old fartedness.  The execution. Back behind the curtain at CF's HQ I'll bet are smart chefs who are great cooks who love their recipes. The problem at this location is execution. (The one exceptional CF that I've visited is in Westlake, CA--always busy. Always booked. Exceptional execution. Every time. Exceptional (and cute) staff.). The end product here feels like it was made remotely by someone manipulating a joy stick somewhere to put dishes together here. Dishes seemed unfinished. Not as put together as they should be. Sloppily presented. Disjointed. Too much sauce. The artichoke dip was microwaved. Seriously? That's like a Gordon Ramsey-level violation. And lazy. The burgers. Meh. Fries. Meh. Even the sweet potato fries that are usually spectacular at CF were terrible. Limp. Over cooked. Soggy.  Sigh. I can't go on. This is how we felt when we left. Just disappointed. And we paid too much, so that part burns but I hate complaining during a meal--it ruins the bon homie. Just kills it and then I get mad. I don't like souring the mood for my boys b/c I'm always happy to be with them. Even over a table of crappily prepared food. So, I'll pay. I just won't go back.  My boyz now call CF The Restaurant That Will Not Be Named.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.248,2.92
32,Brian T.,"Spring Hill, TN",0,65,2.0,2.0,2015-10-18,"It's a chain restaurant, you get what you expect from chain stores and that is an empty wallet and a 50/50 shot of coming away satisfied.  I've been to this location 3 times since it opened, positives and negatives come out each time but never a full on, ""I'm definitely coming back here"" moment. The menu itself is overwhelming and takes an average person a decade to reach the last page, ever wonder why this place is always jam packed? No one is sure what they want when they've read a novel of a menu. Most restaurants specialize in one or two areas but not here, you have mexican next to Italian with american holding hands with God knows what. With a menu this large always remember these items are rarely fresh made and more likely prepped, refrigerated, warmed up, topped then served. Yay for microwaved $8 soup.  After the disastrous menu combinations comes the decision of a lifetime. I've had the safe choice twice before (Club Sandwich) but this last and possibly final time I chose the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Potato Soup and Fries. Ok, I deeply liked the lukewarm potato soup (insert sarcasm). But honestly that was the highlight here. The Parmesan Sandwich was overwhelmingly tasteless with peppers and onions the only distinctive taste that stood out. The chicken tasteless, the sauce ruined by the peppers and onions and the cheese cold and pressed into the bread. So basically I had potato soup with fries, yay carbs. Please don't ask your server what's good or what sells the best, the response is the same all three times, ""All of it is really good"" and that narrows down the ""numbered"" pages of the menu.  My wife loves the chicken medley however she, like me is too afraid to waiver from what tastes ok to try a dish as horrid as mine. We also took home a slice of cheesecake (strawberry and pumpkin). This, was the only highlight of this epic failure. But I swear I can get almost the same quality from Wal-Mart as sad as that is to say. My only wish is that I didn't go for fast food, sad right?  But I will be back to tackle another dish, I refuse to believe there's nothing here that's edible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.216,2.96

I had never been to Cheesecake Factory for real food, only for its namesake cheesecake (which is great). This place was packed on a Friday night but we only had to wait about 30 minutes before a table opened up. Not terrible. As a few people have mentioned before, it is quite loud in here so make sure you sit close to your companions or be prepared to shout. The menu is enormous. We had decided right away that we wanted the Eggroll Sampler so we ordered that and probably still needed 10-15 minutes before we decided what we were going to have to eat. But our server was really nice and gave some recommendations when it was clear that we were struggling. The Sampler was hot and cold. We loved the Avocado and Crispy Cuban varieties, were mixed on the Tex Mex, and didn't really care for the Firecracker Salmon. I opted for the Kobe Burger as my entree, and my fiance got the Americana Cheeseburger. They were both cooked to the temperature requested, and pretty decent overall. The portions are huge, so we both took home half the burgers anyway. And we, of course, had to order some cheesecake to take home. The cheesecake is always fantastic. I've had a few different flavors and they're all great. Three stars means ""A-OK"" and that's pretty much how I feel about Cheesecake Factory. There are lots of menu options, so you're pretty much guaranteed to find something you like. But it is fairly expensive.

Our sever was as disinterested and unpleasant as any I've had in a long time. Took forever with simple requests like water.  But the food was less than ordinary tonight as well. My meal was completely bland and while I waited forever for our dismissive server to return to tell her about it, I lost my appetite. The fact that she argued with me about the amount of food I ate was as gauche as anything I've experienced in a restaurant.  I finally found a manager to complain about how the server was acting toward us the entire meal and he seemed to offer us dessert but when the bill came, my meal had come off (standard practice when someone doesn't like his meal) but we paid for the desserts.  No big deal I suppose but my expectation after talking with the manager was that he'd offer us this ""bone"" to make up for what was a beyond less-than-stellar experience.

They said they only take reservations for right when they open. Why would anyone need to make a reservation for when they first open and there will hardly be anyone there as compared to later. So we worked it out so that I would come in early and get seated at the right time. I was told on the phone waits are usually 30-90 minutes so we came in like an hour early from when we wanted to eat. Waited for less than 10 mins, but I guess that's a good thing. Also I stood there for like 4 minutes just staring at the girl before she noticed me and signed my party in. We got a big booth. Great lighting. It was soooo crowded though. It was bad. We got an app of fries that were really good. The servers were all young and half seemed new. Our waitresses were nice though. We had two because they changed shifts halfway through...

69,Charlotte L.,"Antioch, TN",7,17,2.0,1.0,2016-07-30,"Last night was my first and last time going to this location. My friend and I sat at the bar. We joked a little with our server, she clearly didn't get the joke and things went downhill fast from there. We ordered a slice of cheesecake each. She brought over silverware and napkins but didn't lay out the napkin as had been done for others. When the bread came, we had no plates so my friend literally raised his hand to get her attention, I said excuse me right in her direction and she apparently was too busy unloading the dishwasher to notice either of us. We asked the other server instead who helped us out. Other than a brief ""everything ok"" to which I didn't respond, we had no further interaction with her. She never asked how our cheesecake was, if we needed more water or would like to order more drinks, if we'd like more bread....nothing. Payment was sitting there for almost 10 minutes until my friend asked the other server to take care of it. Our server walked past us multiple times and seemed to be avoiding eye contact, though she had no problem engaging with other people she was serving at the bar. Her top priority seemed to be unloading that dishwasher. As we walked out, no one thanked us for our business, asked how our experience was or wished us a good night. It was the worst dining experience I've ever had. And though I'm not the type to play the race card, we were the only people of color sitting at the bar and the only ones receiving that type of service from her. So either that was a factor or she just didn't like our joking around at the beginning, which was far from offensive. On the flip side, the cheesecake tasted great which accounts for the one star I'm required to give to review. However, next time I want a slice of cheesecake I'll be going to Green Hills.

Cheese enchiladas that didn't have much taste despite the nice presentation. It was a disappointed and he only managed to eat a small portion of it.

That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake. They finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she ""just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it"". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said ""this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce"". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right.  I will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great.

If they had told us it would be 2+ hours of a wait on a Sunday night we would've gone elsewhere but because they kept telling us it would be any minute after that 1hr15min window, we just waited and waited and waited.

I cannot remember the waitresses name because I didn't keep the receipt as I paid with a gift card, but she was a sweet young lady but obviously not on her game. First, we chose outside because of the wait time for a table inside at 5:30 p.m. It was hot! So we placed our drink order which took a few minutes to get, and once we got the drinks it took a bit longer before we got our bread and our order taken! Once our food arrived, the food was very good by the way but my hubbies steak was not cooked as he had requested. Being outside already hot and having hot food placed before us added to the heat our drinks were never refreshed the entire time we were there. Now I know eating outside was our decision but to not have an inquiry about drink refills whether outside or inside is a biggie for us and almost anybody. So we asked the waitress to bring a to-go box and to-go drinks as we were hot and thirsty. Took her a good while to bring the drinks which she only brought one drink when two were requested, so my hubby said forget about it. We wanted to order cheesecake to go but the wait time probably would have been forever. Because we do tip, having been a waitress before and a waiter/waitress cannot live on their paid wages, but mostly their tips, we tipped her well. Not deserving of such a good tip but that is just how we do it. Please make sure the outside waiters/waitresses keep up on drink refills.

1,Mike R.,"Nashville, TN",19,59,32.0,3.0,2017-07-23,"Long wait on the weekends. The one problem I have with this place is their menu. Why do you have a shit ton of entrees? Maybe find a niche and stick with that? Idk. I guess they're smarter than me since they're laughing all the way to the bank. Anyhow. Sorry for getting off track. The service was good and the food was good. Oh look, a butterfly.......whoops I did it again. Anyhow. You can't come here and not try the cheesecake. I chose the Reese's chocolate cheesecake this time. It's rich. But they all are. And after you leave this place you're not so as rich as you were an hour ago. But anyhow. Highly recommend this place for cheesecake. The rest of the food is hardly amazing, but it's decent enough. These big chains have one thing going for them and that is they're safe and recognizable. I always encourage supporting local businesses over these.  Peace out! And get the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
52,Adrian P.,"Nashville, TN",226,2,,5.0,2017-08-01,Had a great experience thanks to Andrew our server. He suggested the perfect glass of white wine to go with my pasta and even made some modifications to my girlfriend's order because they were sold out of the item she originally ordered. I'll definitely return and I'm looking forward to going home and enjoying my Red Velvet Cheescake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin?start=20,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

Our server, Robin, was friendly and answered the (many) questions and (many) recommendations I asked for! Food was delicious and the Nutella cheesecake was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had, which is saying something because cheesecake usually weirds me out. The menu is quite large however I am in the restaurant industry and I really love having so many options, especially at 10:30pm after my shift when I don't even really know what sounds good or what I'll be craving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

My husband and I went to this Cheesecake Factory in Franklin, TN, after previously eating at one in Nashville a couple of weeks ago. It is located in the Cool Springs Mall that is within walking distance of our hotel, Townsuites Marriott.  There pina coladas are amazing! They are VEGAN and served frozen. The vegan avocado toast that is shown as an appetizer could potentially be a small meal. Also, their bread that they serve with every meal in the bread basket is vegan, without butter, of course. We got the veggie burger and the Evelyn's pasta (with olive oil and not butter).We always love this, but it was especially good at this Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88

7,Karen B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,83,6.0,3.0,2017-11-13,"Had lunch at CF today. Been a couple months but they've changed the menu again. They used to have a nice lunch ""combo"" option where you could combine smaller portions of 2 entrees ie: chicken Madeira/shrimp scampi. Not any like longer. Not sure why. It was a nice option.  The pic is of our appetizer. Nashville Hot Chicken bites. Not sure why the cook decided to not put a toothpick and pickle on the 4th corner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88
2,Karen L.,"Franklin, TN",48,292,187.0,4.0,2017-11-26,Seems like a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory to me. I love how late it is open because most stuff in Cool Springs closing early in my opinion. Always have good service here and the food is overflowing and gluttonous as expected. It's not easy to eat healthy here so I say don't try!

14,Olivia M.,"Brentwood, TN",0,3,,5.0,2017-12-06,"I placed an order through DoorDash and when it was brought to me, the fries I ordered weren't there. The driver told me to call Cheesecake Factory for a refund (which didn't make sense since I paid doordash and the driver wasn't about to go and pick them up for me which was the sole purpose of his job anyway) POINT IS, I called CF anyway and the manager Justin was so nice, he offered up one of his employees to bring me my fries. I didn't want to inconvenience them in anyway because that seems ludicrous for just some fries. But he mentioned he just wants his customer to be happy and I mean, duh, I got my fries. I'm totally happy. And happy with good management. 10/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,4.08,3.05,3.05,,3.462
4,Eddie S.,"Fort Myers, FL",66,220,63.0,3.0,2017-12-09,"I met a longtime friend at TCF when I visited Nashville. Surprisingly, they were not busy which is unusual for a Cheesecake Factory so I was a little nervous. It took a while for our server to come by the table but she was friendly so it was okay, plus it gave me and my friend time to catch up. The did not have any vegan dishes, so I had one modified; however, when they brought it out it was missing the marinara. They promptly took it back and made the correction. The meal overall was okay. Nothing special and to my surprise my Olive Garden meal the night before was better (egad!). My friend ordered fish and chips and she said it was just okay so not sure if I will be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,4.0,3.05,3.05,,3.43

On the way up there I looked at the menu and was shocked by the prices and how large the menu was. Then, once my boyfriend and I arrived I was entranced by how cozy and inviting it looked. It was quite packed which was a great sign. We ordered fried mushrooms for and appetizer. Then I ordered the tomato basil pasta and it was delicious. I had so much leftover. Then we had the strawberry cheesecake. It's was exquisite. A few hours later I realized my phone wasn't on me. We went back and they had it for me. They ensured it was my phone and I am extremely grateful. Will definitely come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-franklin,4.0,3.08,3.08,,3.4480000000000004

Entrees served piecemeal...2 first, five minutes later two more, then one, then one. My burger was served medium (pink in middle) and waitress tried to explain this was Cheesecake Factory interpretation of medium well.     My burger was good though not hot. Fries very good.
