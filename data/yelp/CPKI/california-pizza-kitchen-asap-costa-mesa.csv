Johan M.,"Tustin, CA",82,223,2,4.0,5/30/2010,"CPK ASAP is basically a fast food version of California Pizza Kitchen, which I like. In fact, I wish there were more CPK ASAPs because I love CPK pizza but sometimes if I want to hit up CPK during my lunch break, I don't want to wait for a table, sit down, get my order taken, wait for my drinks, wait for my food, get my food delivered, eat, wait for a refill, wait for the bill, pay and leave. CPK ASAP is basically just like going to Carl's Jr or Wahoos, order at the table, fill up your drinks, sit down and wait and eat when your order's ready. They even have grab and go salads if you're really in a rush! This place is located at the South Coast Plaza Crystal Court, which I personally think is a beautiful location. It can get busy at times, but when I recently went, it was pretty slow.  They have a more limited menu than regular CPKs but it's still good. The prices aren't too bad, especially because after all, it's South Coast Plaza and the rent must run into the hundred thousands per month. Personal pizzas/sandwiches/salads run around $8, large pizzas for 2 run around $15 and drinks run around $1.79.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza I had was spot on! A crispy cracker like crust with fresh grilled chicken covered in BBQ Sauce, cheese, red onions and cilantro, pretty good portion size. The drink was out of the fountain and it got crowded at times and this old lady got mad because some guy was taking a while to fill up his drink, add another soda machine CPK!  It was a pretty good lunch and for $11 total at South Coast Plaza isn't bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Champ M.,"Los Angeles, CA",351,578,968,4.0,1/6/2010,"A sexy luncheon hot spot for resting those aching legs, cuz u know, shopping at the world's premier plaza is so much strain on all our skinny OC bodies. I recommend any of the pizzas and the mandatory Honey Dijon Chicken & Bacon Panini. It is bowzaonkerz. The ""ASAP"" addition doesn't mean anything. It's just for looks. Patio seating is hella chill. For people watching. Damn fobs with all their Fendi bags.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Akira A.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,54,55,4.0,2/8/2010,"First time I came here with my friend, I wasn't gonna eat pizza. But after I stole one slice of original BBQ chicken pizza, I end up eating 1.5 whole 9 inch pizza.  It was yummy. Also I'm huge fun of red velvet cake here altho it's kind a pricy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Anita L.,"Irvine, CA",1332,4054,3671,3.0,9/1/2006,"It wasn't my idea of a good place to eat, but lil guy insisted so we went to this CPK. It wasn't a regular sit down CPK but instead it was called CPK ASAP. You order, take a number and they bring the food out to you (which seems to be very popular in south OC). Lil guy ordered a Hawaiian pizza -- kids meal -- which came with a drink plus crayons etc to keep him occupied. I opted for the bacon gorgonzola salad tossed with the dijon vinagrette.  I'm guessing the Hawaiian pizza was really good because he polished it off before I even finished my salad. My salad was not bad at all. I'm not feeling sick yet -- my last CPK experience in Hawaii ended up with me in the bathroom most of the afternoon -- so hopefully if was a one off thing. There is ample seating and it is situated right as you get off the bridge from the main South Coast Plaza building to the new one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Traci D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",226,715,21,2.0,4/24/2009,"This is an CPK ASAP...meaning As Soon As Possible...this makes me think that normal CPKs take their time getting your food to you and so your food has been sitting around while before it gets to your plate.  After ordering a sandwich from the lady at the counter, she told me it would take 10-15 mins for my food to come out. 10 to 15 mins? That is like the same amount of time it takes a regular CPK to bring your food out. I got my drink and sat down at a table and waited for my food to come out. It actually was only a 5 minute wait so that was good. My sandwich was good and I only ate half of it.  I went back to the counter to ask for a to-go box. I stood behind a girl who was also asking for a to-go box. After she walked away, I tried to get someone behind the counter's attention. A woman finally said to me ""We are not taking orders, please get in line."" I told the lady that I just wanted a to-go box and she grabbed one, handed it to me and walked away.  So basically this CPK ASAP is like an overpriced high school cafeteria: waiting in line for average food with crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Marita L.,"Nashville, TN",20,61,,4.0,9/7/2009,"I need to preface this review by saying that I haven't had their pizza (what they're known for). But, I LOVED their tomato basil bisque. Usually I have to be in the right mood for tomato soup, but I think I could eat their bisque anytime and love it. I think it's because it has butternut squash in it... so good. I actually wish I had some right now. Their new field greens salad is tasty as well. It's the usual greens, pear, candied walnuts, blue cheese combo that I first fell in love with at Nordstrom's cafe many years ago, but here the dressing is a dijon balsamic vinaigrette. The only thing I would get rid of is the radicchio - it's just a little too bitter for the salad. Overall, really tasty food though, and it really hits the spot when you need a break from shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Paulo A.,"Merced, CA",35,126,35,5.0,10/12/2009,"Walk to the counter, order your food and wait for them to bring you the deliciousness that is the CPK pizza!

Dee N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1049,428,85,3.0,2/3/2010,"This place is just okay. I like that it's located just before the Bridge of Gardens, so it's a great place to people watch if you're into that. XD The food here isn't as good as the actual CPK restaurants, though it is sort of a fast food version of it, so I guess ""okay"" food is expected. Their tomato soup is good most of their times, and you can't go wrong with a bbq chicken pizza, but the paninis definitely need some work so that people don't break their teeth eating one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,3.0,2/26/2008,"Chocolate brownies!   I'm only giving CPK ASAP three stars for now since I haven't eaten a meal here, and it probably wouldn't be fair to rate them solely on dessert, but seriously, you have to try the brownies here!  I never would have thought to order brownies from CPK, considering Corner Bakery and other places known for pastries are close by, but someone brought a box of these chocolaty delights to my office and I just about fell over when I took my first bite. Chocolaty smooth, not overly sugary, melt-in-your-mouth gooiness...I usually don't get so excited over sweets, but man, this brownie rocks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Duc L.,"Norcross, GA",6,16,7,3.0,7/28/2008,"I never had pizza here, but I really like their Tuna Salad Sandwich plus Tortilla or Chicken Noodle soup. I just wish they weren't so pricey for what they give you, because the sandwhich is a little more than 7 dollars and the soup with it makes the total close to 11 dollars, which doesn't make sense for food that is suppose to be ASAP. I also recommend take out, because the location has a lot of traffic going in and out around you, and if you don't like people glancing at you while you eat, you might want take-out. Otherwise, eating here every now and then is okay, but I much prefer Wahoo's Fish Tacos that is a floor below it in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Cesar A.,"Santa Ana, CA",245,273,172,4.0,1/22/2011,Pizzas are always good plus they have salads if your watching the carbs. This place is good for people watching as it sits next to the bridge over looking Bear Street.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
S ..,"San Diego, CA",568,660,1467,4.0,10/22/2010,"So far not bad. Perhaps a little overpriced. It's pretty quiet here, not a lot of people. Perfect to read a book with your meal or have a quiet conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa

Jimmy N.,"Anaheim, CA",564,767,159,3.0,8/5/2007,"This location, despite being named ASAP.. is NOT ASAP. The food comes out just as long as a regular CPK would, and you still have to get your own table and drinks. There is however, ample seating on the patio and out of by the escalators and throughout the mall.  The service is mediocre but varies depending on the time of day. I've found the best service to be just before lunch (I'd say around 11am) or close to early dinner / late lunch (around 4-5pm).  I think, for what it is, it's not bad. Sitting outside is pretty nice, and with OC weather, it almost never fails to have a great view or just enjoy the senses. It's particularly nice during the holidays where the mall hires carolers to sing, and one of their stops is right by the entrance to the bridge where the outside patio is.. so if you like that holiday merriment and music, sit outside. :)  PS: If you work in the mall, there is free delivery and employee discount M-F after 2:30pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
Erin M.,"Long Beach, CA",500,45,3,2.0,5/31/2010,"CPK not-so-ASAP. We waited for a long time to get our food, and when we walked up to ask how much longer we saw our food sitting there without heating as if it had been there for a while waiting for someone to take it out to us. Food was really cold. Aside from that, the food is pretty much just as good as a regular CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-costa-mesa
