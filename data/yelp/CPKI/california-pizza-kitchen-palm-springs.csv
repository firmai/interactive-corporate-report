Kevin G.,"Lake Balboa, CA",4,71,7,4.0,9/16/2013,"The food was good, I'd give it a 3/5. We both got salads, so hard to mess up. I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the server Jonathan. He was real cool and personable. I told my friend he looked like an actor and she asked him. Ended up being Neal McDonough from Justified, Captain America, etc. It was spot on, haha. I never say this, but I'd consider going back here for the service. He was always one step ahead of our requests, and attentive, even though it was empty. But still, he could have easily hid in the back and got a 15% tip, but he earned his 30% tip which I RARELY do.  I hardly go out to eat these days, but while on vacation we didn't feel like cooking at the house. It was nice to be waited on, and without the attitude or fakeness that most servers in Los Angeles have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-springs

For a Wednesday evening it was quiet, I was the only person sitting at the bar.  It's been a while since I've eaten at CPK but what's slick is that they publish their entire menu and disclose total calories, sodium, fat etc in a separate book.  I started out with a small cravings wedge salad, it contained crisp iceberg lettuce topped with blue cheese dressing, applewood bacon, chopped egg and diced Roma tomatoes. The portion was perfect.  Since the wild halibut has as many calories as the Jambalaya I opted for the latter. Blackened chicken and shrimp in a spicy sauce with crawfish, Andouille sausage and pieces of ham served on linguine and topped with green onions. It was on the spicy side but I enjoyed it.  The waitress was friendly, attentive and checked with me several times  that all was good. I would return here in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-springs

What great service and workers....back home I'm sure it would be gone as soon as I left. The pizza was also very good. We tried the garlic chicken, the club, and the Hawaiian. My favorite was the club, it was a very different type of pizza, kind of like a salad on a thin cracker. The other pizzas also had a super thin crust, which made it taste a bit more like a cracker, but still good. Our waitress was super friendly, and checked up on us often.

The most amazing thing was the girl in the front saw us approaching and opened the door for  two of us. The food ordered was packed with plates and utensils, we took three pizzas and a salad with cookies.  The hot food smelled delicious this was another hot day here with triple degree temperatures. The chicken salad comes with cilantro, basil, tortilla strips and Monterey Jack tossed in  herb ranch dressing. Topped with BBQ chicken, tomatoes and scallions. and tortilla strips. This is a delight to eat and the taste buds thank you and fills you up quickly. When we ate the food the taste was most amazing. This is because they use fresh ingredients to cook their food.

Hannah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",393,237,334,4.0,2/6/2013,"I've always been a fan of CPK. As far as suburbanite dining goes, this place has consistency on service and taste. The Palm Springs location has ample outdoor seating that overlooks Palm Canyon Drive, and the servers are seemingly always in a fantastic mood. Cute people work there too... just sayin' The great part about this Palm Springs location, it seems, is the familiarity with so many of the customers. As regulars, they know us by name, know what we like to eat, and do their best to work with our routine. Sometimes the new trainees take some time to adjust, but CPK has this magical way of training employees so that they catch on amazingly fast. When I went to Taipei they opened a CPK right next to Taipei 101, and I brought friends in there as often as possible. It was one of the few places in that big foreign city that offered delicious gourmet pizza, large delicious salads (salad is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to find in Taipei), inexpensive wines by the glass, and smiled when they served our food. Visiting the CPK in Taiwan made me terribly homesick, I always enjoyed that little slice of California sun when far from home. Now that I'm back, I visit the Palm Springs location all the time. I have just been informed that starting this month, they will offer a brand new Brussel Sprouts, Bacon and Ricotta cheese pizza, as well as a new Beets, Arugula and Goat Cheese salad!!! Yaaay~!! the salad sounds great, and is right on par with current California food trends. Brussel sprouts, too, never seem to get enough credit for being an amazing vegetable. As long as they're not boiled or steamed, brussel sprouts are damn good. I can't wait to try this pizza! I just hope the ricotta doesn't make it too salty...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-springs
Jamie A.,"San Diego, CA",48,205,65,4.0,2/22/2011,The CPK Cobb Salad (half was enough to share with pizza with another person) was very delicious!  I could have just had the salad.  The margherita pizza wasn't all that good.   The waitress was very friendly.  I don't really care for all the up sale recommendations though (appetizer and dessert).  If I wanted either I would have asked or ordered it!

Perhaps the pizza options would have been a better choice as my friends seemed to enjoy theirs though only one wanted to take home her leftovers.

Juan F.,"Studio City, CA",121,242,328,2.0,4/27/2009,"Two Stars for a ""Two-bit"" salad and a not-so-satisfied feeling.  Maybe it's a sign of the tough economic times, but the sizes of salads at this Palm Springs CPK have shrunk to the point where you think you've gotten the wrong order. Sadly the prices remain the same. (Check out my picture)  My favorite CPK salad is the Thai Crunch salad. The Large size has always been enough to share with someone else, then split a pizza.  This time three of us ordered salads and we would share a pizza. When I asked the waitress if this was the ""large size"" she said YES and would not admit the portion size had shrunk.

Jennifer L.,"Palm Springs, CA",178,166,168,3.0,8/6/2011,"This is one of my favorite places to eat so my review will be of the food and service. Food was a 5, service a 2. I've tried almost all of the pizzas and have my favorits. Thai, BBQ, Meat, Hawaiian etc and they are always delicious. Tried the thin crust though for the first time last night and loved it as well. Think I'll get from now on.  Salads are always good too. Thai is my favorite. Tried some fun beers too and almost the Mojiti...but maybe next time.  The service was lacking and that's always a bummer for me because I know I'm going to have to report it back to you and I'd report nice things. Our waitress just wasn't there for us lol She would come here and there. She brought us our salad but no plates. We shared for awhile and then she finally came with a plate. Our waters came about 30 minutes later. The place wasn't busy so I just think maybe she was tired? But we still tipped and left full. Can I also (Not CPK's fault) say the group of ladies next to us flashing pictures the entire time we were there...you shouldn't leave your home.

Kenneth H.,"Northeast Portland, Portland, OR",100,229,1,3.0,3/1/2011,"It is a pretty massive chain that banks on people liking slightly unusual pizza toppings.  I remember when this chain started popping up all over the place my parents (die hard NYC folk) refused to even look at CPK because of what they had done to the holiest of holies, the pizza.  While I am not as opposed as my parents to artichokes, and BBQ chicken and other exotic toppings on my pizza I have to say that CPK takes a great idea and simply falls apart during execution.  The whole experience of any CPK oozes with corporate fast food culture and really overshadows whatever revolutionary pizza creating they happen to be doing.

The most amazing thing was the girl in the front saw us approaching and opened the door for  two of us. The food ordered was packed with plates and utensils, we took three pizzas and a salad with cookies.  The hot food smelled delicious this was another hot day here with triple degree temperatures. The chicken salad comes with cilantro, basil, tortilla strips and Monterey Jack tossed in  herb ranch dressing. Topped with BBQ chicken, tomatoes and scallions. and tortilla strips. This is a delight to eat and the taste buds thank you and fills you up quickly. When we ate the food the taste was most amazing. This is because they use fresh ingredients to cook their food.

Hannah R.,"Los Angeles, United States",393,237,334,4.0,6/2/2013,"I've always been a fan of CPK. As far as suburbanite dining goes, this place has consistency on service and taste. The Palm Springs location has ample outdoor seating that overlooks Palm Canyon Drive, and the servers are seemingly always in a fantastic mood. Cute people work there too... just sayin' The great part about this Palm Springs location, it seems, is the familiarity with so many of the customers. As regulars, they know us by name, know what we like to eat, and do their best to work with our routine. Sometimes the new trainees take some time to adjust, but CPK has this magical way of training employees so that they catch on amazingly fast. When I went to Taipei they opened a CPK right next to Taipei 101, and I brought friends in there as often as possible. It was one of the few places in that big foreign city that offered delicious gourmet pizza, large delicious salads (salad is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to find in Taipei), inexpensive wines by the glass, and smiled when they served our food. Visiting the CPK in Taiwan made me terribly homesick, I always enjoyed that little slice of California sun when far from home. Now that I'm back, I visit the Palm Springs location all the time. I have just been informed that starting this month, they will offer a brand new Brussel Sprouts, Bacon and Ricotta cheese pizza, as well as a new Beets, Arugula and Goat Cheese salad!!! Yaaay~!! the salad sounds great, and is right on par with current California food trends. Brussel sprouts, too, never seem to get enough credit for being an amazing vegetable. As long as they're not boiled or steamed, brussel sprouts are damn good. I can't wait to try this pizza! I just hope the ricotta doesn't make it too salty...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-springs
Jamie A.,"San Diego, United States",48,205,65,4.0,22/2/2011,The CPK Cobb Salad (half was enough to share with pizza with another person) was very delicious!  I could have just had the salad.  The margherita pizza wasn't all that good.   The waitress was very friendly.  I don't really care for all the up sale recommendations though (appetizer and dessert).  If I wanted either I would have asked or ordered it!

Perhaps the pizza options would have been a better choice as my friends seemed to enjoy theirs though only one wanted to take home her leftovers.

Juan F.,"Studio City, United States",121,242,328,2.0,27/4/2009,"Two Stars for a ""Two-bit"" salad and a not-so-satisfied feeling.  Maybe it's a sign of the tough economic times, but the sizes of salads at this Palm Springs CPK have shrunk to the point where you think you've gotten the wrong order. Sadly the prices remain the same. (Check out my picture)  My favorite CPK salad is the Thai Crunch salad. The Large size has always been enough to share with someone else, then split a pizza.  This time three of us ordered salads and we would share a pizza. When I asked the waitress if this was the ""large size"" she said YES and would not admit the portion size had shrunk.

Jennifer L.,"Palm Springs, United States",178,166,168,3.0,6/8/2011,"This is one of my favorite places to eat so my review will be of the food and service. Food was a 5, service a 2. I've tried almost all of the pizzas and have my favorits. Thai, BBQ, Meat, Hawaiian etc and they are always delicious. Tried the thin crust though for the first time last night and loved it as well. Think I'll get from now on.  Salads are always good too. Thai is my favorite. Tried some fun beers too and almost the Mojiti...but maybe next time.  The service was lacking and that's always a bummer for me because I know I'm going to have to report it back to you and I'd report nice things. Our waitress just wasn't there for us lol She would come here and there. She brought us our salad but no plates. We shared for awhile and then she finally came with a plate. Our waters came about 30 minutes later. The place wasn't busy so I just think maybe she was tired? But we still tipped and left full. Can I also (Not CPK's fault) say the group of ladies next to us flashing pictures the entire time we were there...you shouldn't leave your home.

But as I left, my husband was paying the bill, I had the baby in my arms and was pushing the stroller......... The greeter was holding the door open and kindly greeting new customers, I step aside and as the last one came in, I stepped out to go through the door, he stepped forward, let go of the door and let it close in my face!!!!!
