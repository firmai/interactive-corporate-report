24,Ben W.,"Keller, TX",22,36,14.0,3.0,2012-03-08,"So so. That sums up the quality of the food, atmosphere, and service. Granted, we came in close to 9pm, so I'm not sure what to expect.

28,Alex B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,33,,1.0,2012-09-11,"Yesterday was my first trip to Chili's in North Pueblo. I placed a to-go order for a bowl of chili with a caesar salad and two kids meals, chicken crispers and a cheeseburger with no condiments, both with fries. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The chili was like tomato soup with a few spices thrown in. There was maybe an ounce of beef at the very bottom of the bowl. I really hope that I just got the last of a pot of chili and that this isn't the chili that is served to everyone; you'd think that with the name Chili's the chili would be good! About five minutes after leaving the restaurant the fries were cold, the chicken was barely lukewarm, and the cheeseburger that I ordered without condiments had ketchup, mustard, and pickles directly on the burger. The problem with picky eaters is that no matter how hard you try to scrape off the ketchup and mustard, they can still taste it and refuse to eat it. Ironically, the salad was the best part of the order and the only quality food I got exactly as I ordered.  The restaurant wasn't busy; there was a couple at the bar and a guy who came to the bar while I was waiting for my food along with three tables. I arrived at the restaurant about 10 minutes after placing my order, even though I was told that the order would take about 15 minutes to make. I did this specifically so the food would be hot. I can't see any excuse for the lousy food I got. I strongly doubt I'll be returning to this Chili's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo?start=20,,,,,
20,Allison F.,"Aurora, CO",91,422,49.0,3.0,2013-05-02,"Stopped here for lunch on our way out of town on a Sunday. Our group of 6 was immediately seated and the restaurant appeared to be fairly full. Our server was very pleasant and you could tell they were all in a bit of a rush. We placed our drink orders and they were delivered pretty quickly. One of our cups had a mystery item in it and a new glass was brought out immediately without any questions. Comp chips and salsa were brought out after about 15 minutes and were appreciated as we were starving. The food was standard for a Chilis location. I ordered my typical crispy chicken tacos and got a mystery dish with bacon on it. After outlining what I had ordered to the other server who had delivered our food, I got a huffy explanation that I had the order wrong and that they would replace it. By the time our table was almost done eating, my dish arrived. It was fine and portion size for the tacos was larger than usual in Denver. I received about 1/4cup of rice, which was fine as it was already a lot of food. Everything was ok with our visit but not outstanding. I don't appreciate being scolded for ordering correctly but was thankful that they could easily fix the dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo?start=20,,,,,
22,Kim B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,63,6.0,1.0,2014-06-28,"Worst Chili's experience ever!!!   Was looking forward to our visit, as we usually enjoy Chili's other locations, but this location certainly did not live up to our expectations. Our waitress had absolutely NO personality, and was SUPER slow!!  When we finally got our food, the Santa Fe Chicken Salad was not prepared as described on the menu.  The number one reason I ordered the salad was because it had avocado on it, and my salad came with none.  It took our waitress over five minutes to come back with TWO very THIN slices of avocado!!!  Gee THANKS!!!  But, not only was it missing ingredients, but it was literally swimming in dressing.  I tried to ignore the soggy dripping dressing, but after about five bites, it was just to much.  The Manager happened to be walking by and asked if everything was ok.  When I told her the salad was swimming in dressing, she agreed and said she would bring me back another salad.  Over ten minutes later, when everyone else had finished their meal, my salad had still not arrived, so on our way out we told the manager to just forget it.  She then said we were welcome to sit and wait a few more minutes for the salad.  When I explained that it had already been over 10 minutes, her reply......Oh Well, we are busy.  Really!!!!!!  I had already waited, and had TWO issues with my meal.  Salad should have  been made and returned to me within minutes!!!   Bad Customer Service all the way around!!!!  DON'T BOTHER EVEN GOING TO THIS LOCATION!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo?start=20,,,,,

11,Sam P.,"Las Vegas Strip, NV",204,147,158.0,1.0,2014-11-11,"Ok, so now I remember why I don't eat at Chili's anymore... Came in for a late lunch and the problems started immediately. The hostesses seemed bewildered by my entrance to the place (not certain if I caught them off-guard, but definitely unprepared!) After clearing up the confusion (?), I was shown to a seat and the waiter was really nice. Not certain if he was expecting me to order with the new nifty-iPad-like devices on the table, but he seemed unprepared to answer my questions (Not like these were hard ones either, my first question was ""Where is the menu?"" and second was ""Is there a lunch menu?"") He left a little rattled. He swung back, I ordered and the food came out like 2-minutes later. Super quick, but the chili was cold and the salad had cheese on it (Yuck!) He remedied the salad, and I refused on the chili warm-up. Another waitress came by to check on me (Odd... Not a manager, just the server that perhaps was supposed to have my table-She seemed perturbed.)  I finished lunch and was ready to go... And then he disappeared? They all disappeared! I tried to get someone (anyone's) attention, but no. He ultimately returned and I said I was ready to go. He said I could use the iPad-like machine, but I already had and couldn't checkout (Option NOT Provided). I gave him my card and asked him to run it (here came that confused-look again). He returned, looked at the iPad device on the table behind me and said that I could have checked out from there (Huh?) I signed the tab and exited... Remember Chili's: Beer is good cold, Chili is NOT! Will I return... Uh no!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
19,Carl M.,"Arvada, CO",37,62,10.0,2.0,2015-04-17,How the hell in 2015 does a restaurant not know how to make a burger with out a wheat bun.  Ask for a lettuce wrapped burger.   Server said we don't know how to do that here...low carb and people that don't eat wheat...this is a restaurant is a place to stay away from.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
15,Zack H.,"Pueblo, CO",30,53,3.0,2.0,2015-04-26,"Oh, Chili's. You try so hard. It's cute.  On my last visit, my friend and I sat at the bar for a late lunch...around 2:30ish on a Saturday. Chili's was weirdly busy for the entire time that we were there, both in the bar and dining room. Something about people in this town and mediocre chain restaurants...I don't know.  Our bartender was friendly, but clearly harried. He had a full bar, was making service drinks, and running food all at once. I got the feeling that it was probably a time that he would use to prep for the dinner rush but was still busy during the ""in-between"" time and was stressed out because of it. We ordered 2-for-1 pints of beer and ordered some food; I had the turkey burger and my lady friend decided on a chicken salad of some stripe. Then we waited. Sysco nuke-and-serve usually doesn't take very long, but it was definitely about a 25 minute wait from the time we watched him enter the order into Aloha and when he finally brought it to us. The turkey burger was pretty good, and the fries serviceable (they also came in this cute little tin thing...charming). My friend's salad, however, was served on a dirty plate that clearly had someone's thumbprint on the rim. Apparently the expo was lazy, because it was pretty blatant and gross.  Both of us have been servers and so we felt bad sending it back, but seriously? If I were the GM here, I'd be embarrassed that food could leave my kitchen looking like that salad did. It's Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
18,Stephanie L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",23,34,6.0,2.0,2015-05-20,Came in to this location for dinner in between work projects. Fairly busy for a Wednesday night. Sat in the bar area at a high top table. It took our server 10 minutes to acknowledge that we were there. We ordered the regular queso and it was actually made the way we like it. Chips were fresh and the salsa was a bit watery. Both of us ordered steak fajitas. Mine was also with chicken. My fiances was double steak and pork. Both of steak portions were still raw or barely rare when served to us. We sent back both plates to be recooked. The second time our meals came out the peppers and onions were burnt and stuck to the dishes. My fiance had also asked for more chips before our meal came out and he was ignored by our server.  I don't think we will be coming back to this location anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
13,Athena G.,"Cripple Creek, CO",4,17,3.0,1.0,2015-08-28,The server seemed to be inconvenienced with helping us. I ordered a quesadilla salad and barely got any salad and was drenched in dressing. I will not go back and don't recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
16,Brad O.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,13,,1.0,2016-01-29,"We arrived around 6 o'clock on a Thursday night.   Didn't get seated for nearly 45 minutes.   Then, after waiting another hour for our food to be delivered, half of it was cold.   Obviously, they were overwhelmed. The manager comped half of our meal and we didn't get out until almost 9:30.  On the flip side, the smothered chicken burrito was delicious. Seems like they need to make some major changes if they want to keep any business other than the local bar flies. I would start at the top and look at some remedial training for the entire staff....    The bar rescue guy would come in and scream at you all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,
17,Joseph P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,76,,2.0,2016-04-30,"Ate there tonight and had a horrible meal, corn on the cob was freezer burnt, tasted horrible.  French fries were cold.   My wife and grandson both had the fajitas, and had a question about the check.  Seems the $12.95 for fajitas is with NO meat.  If you want meat it is $1.50 for EACH type of meat, so my wife and grandson both wanted the prime rib.  So they were both charged $3.00 extra for the meat?  Waiter claims this was considered a combo meat meal, and since they both ordered only prime rib, that they got charged an extra $3.00!  Very confusing way to price a dish, and very OVERPRICED.  Hate this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,

6,Nickie S.,"Pueblo, CO",0,5,,2.0,2017-05-01,Went to Chilis on Elizabeth first time I'd. Been in years!! Wait staff was friendly and quick to the table but: Here's the problems: Asked for help with menu items as menu has change quite a bit server just said all was good not helpful when you are trying to figure out what to order People setting in next booth. Very helpful as they go quite often so I tried chicken pasta was very good not the problem  Problem lies in what was ordered  was not received as I ordered to go I brought my order home as am disabled and had to bring my guide dog home to feed too found that order was missing  One side and soup  And desert that I'd asked for cheesecake  Well was charged for all but cheesecake even so to go. Back will cost money to rectify this error!!! Unhappy customer as I only treat myself to one night out a month and this was my treat was very disappointed that was not given my complete order.  My fault for not checking out the bag but hurting and being in extreme pain I just wanted to get home and is when I discovered not all the order was there!  I know server was extremely busy as her was only one taking. Care of all the tables but is no excuse to not make certain for the customer all Is there as I was thinking how much I'd missed there food and now am not thinking that I miss it so much  Customer service has really taken a back seat!!! When are people going to remember that without excellence in customer service that people like me who go out rare looks for great service to help them out as them we go back and back as we know we are important here I wasn't  Will try a competitor next month as who want inadequacy and 1/2 their order?? Server should repeat the order as no matter length of service mistakes can. Be made as here's a awesome example of just that which could have been avoided  Will be a long time. Before I go back!!! Maybe next time they will have wait staff that will listen and bring back right order and repeat it to make certain cya and mine is always best policy Thanks see you in another I dunno 6-10 years see if you can learn to take an order by then lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,

7,LaDonna B.,"Loveland, CO",0,4,,1.0,2017-06-16,"Driving through Pueblo on our way home to Denver, stopped by here and was very disappointed. The staff was good but whoever prepared our meal was awful. We waited a whole hour for our meal; Our chicken crisper were practically cremated and the full rack of ribs was cold. We even had the manager touch it-even had her note that our fries were still warm compared to the ribs! So upsetting!! Manager did offer another rack of ribs but SERIOUSLY we waited an hour an could not wait ANOTHER hour!!! She did however deduct the meal from our bill, so if you are near starved and want a good, hot meal-this is not the place to stop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,,,,,

0,Desiree D.,"Washington, DC",129,223,138.0,5.0,2017-12-04,"I came to the Chili's here in Pueblo while I was visiting my daughter. She insists on chain restaurants because she likes the food loves the games they have. I won't lie, I have become a bit of a food snob since moving to Washington DC. With that said, It's probably apparent I usually do not patronize chains. I was a bit hesitant when I saw the 2-star rating on Yelp. While reading the other reviews I noticed the poor reviews came from individuals who rarely leave them. The more positive reviews came from more avid Yelpers. That made me realize this place suffers from unfortunately what many other chains do.... People that only leave bad reviews. I realize it will likely not hurt business here, however it is clearly unfair. I felt compelled to leave a review because I had a great experience here. We arrived around lunch on Sunday and were greeted by a friendly host who promptly seated us. We were then subsequently greeted by our server Gabe who was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and very attentive. He gave great recommendations and stayed attentive to my daughter and I even when he had two tables with 8-10 people. He was wonderful, although I observed the rest of the staff and they upheld the same standard as our server... Simply amazing. They have an all-day HH on Sunday which should be taken advantage of, especially for football season. One of my favorites it the Presidente Margarita for $6. We had the chips and salsa for the appetizer. I must say they have amazing in-house chips. For the entree I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex bowl. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and chipotle pesto was amazing! I seriously wish I would have taken some to go. My daughter had the pizza with pineapple.... and fresh (not from the can) pineapple! The prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable. I know during peak times service can be hindered, but I had a top-notch experience. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pueblo,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

Entire time she was in the kitchen I can hear her say ""he got me fucked up"" multiple times due to waiting on multiple tables by herself. I counted 4 tables. She did not once acknowledge us, or inform us about the wait. She had poor dress attire where her pants were almost falling off, and gigantic heart hoop earrings looked completely unprofessional. Not once introduced herself, and was rude when taking our order. When we decided we were gonna leave.
