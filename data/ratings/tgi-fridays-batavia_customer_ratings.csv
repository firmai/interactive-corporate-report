25,Elizabeth J.,"Geneva, IL",1,28,3.0,2.0,2012-01-13,Service was deplorable. There were communication issues between the hostess and the bar with regard to seating.  Spoke to the manager and he said it is always like that on Friday nights.  Suggested they implement a better process only to hear more excuses.  Drinks were slow.  Got a steak that was cooked more rare than medium as requested.  Overall food was OK. The highlight of the meal was my skinny margarita.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=40,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

41,Rodney R.,"Batavia, IL",10,19,4.0,4.0,2012-03-04,Had a great time. Did not have to wait more than five minutes. Food was excellent and our waitress was right on the money. We never had to ask for anything. My only real issue is with all of the televisions. Why is it that restaurants suddenly have to have wall to wall tv?  I go to a restaurant with friends to talk and visit not have everyone staring off at the television facing them. What a distraction.  (Yes some of my stories are boring but not that boring lol) We will return soon and definitely order steak!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

It used to be cooler when they got on the tables and sang happy birthday to people, but I digress.

21,Tom K.,"Darien, IL",149,27,1.0,2.0,2012-12-29,"When we arrived at the restaurant, we had a brief wait (about 5 minutes) for a table.  This was on Saturday night at 7:30 pm.  When we were seated, we were given a menu and told that the Jack Daniels specials were highly recommended.  It took quite awhile for the waiter to arrive, so I started checking out the menu, and quickly noticed that about 80% of the menu was ""Jack Daniels"" specials.  JD ribs, JD chicken, JD steak, and yes, even JD dessert!  My recommendation - if you don't like Jack Daniels, then this restaurant probably isn't for you. I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp.  It was average at best.  The service was below average.  We were never asked for drink refills, never had any water at our table, and our check was given to us before our dessert was delivered.  They waiter didn't even provide us with napkins for our dessert. This is pretty much what you can expect from a suburban chain restaurant.  Average food, below average service.  However, if you like Jack Daniels, this is the place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=40,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

We come in and we sit at the bar and goof around with the bartenders who we have become friends with.  We first started coming to this Friday's location for the trivia nights they had every friday. we would get a big group of people together and play. The trivia was a ton of fun! The actual food was not the best but not awful-just the average chain restaurant food. Now lets talk about the real reason why I just cant give this location any more then 3 stars...the wait staff. They are just terrible! Some of them have attitudes while others seem to have ADD and can forget they even have tables. We had one waitress  that had her new born child at a table and refused to help her tables! It was crazy... Next time you head up to this location, sit at the bar. The bartenders are the complete opposite of the wait staff. The bartenders are very personable and make you feel super comfortable.

We asked for a booth, but were repeatedly told it wasn't allowed for fire safety bc we needed a high chair also. It took talking to the manager for this happen- apparently we simply needed to be moved across the restaurant where there was more aisle room. Why not offer a customer this begin with?! 2nd issue, why on earth would you give a preschooler mac and cheese in a ceramic dish that is scalding hot? It was so hot that even after sittting there 20 mins it still almost burned my mom putting it into a to-go container (bc of course he couldn't eat this incredibly HOT food).

45,Bob S.,"Geneva, IL",0,115,,2.0,2014-08-21,"I have not been to Fridays in several years, but the television ads made the ""new"" menu seem decent. We went on a weekday evening for dinner. The employees seem to be trying to implement whatever the corporate plan is, but it does not work. They seem to be going through the motions. For example, two staff members open one door for customers when entering and leaving. However, there are two doors, so customers have to open the other door anyway. The host pointlessly identifies himself, says to contact him for anything we need, moments before our waiter comes to the table. The waiter then asks if we have been to Fridays recently. We answer ""no"", and expect to hear about all the wonderful changes. Instead, we are told that there are now a lot of steaks on the menu and they are recommended. In addition, if you like Jack Daniels, there are a lot of dishes you will like. I tuned him out after this unhelpful waste of words. The food was somewhat disappointing. The cheese stick appetizer was very good. Potato skin appetizer was pretty awful. Instead of real cheese, they used some sort of cheese spread. French fries were cold and greasy. On one fish dish, the fries were inexcusably presented swimming in the juice from the fish. These were not only cold and greasy, but soggy too. Portions have been decreased to pretty small amounts, although entre prices are fairly high. All in, the service was forced friendly, but not genuine. Food was subpar, over priced, and not much of it. I do not see any reason to return. Whatever changes were made to the Fridays menu and dining experience did nothing for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

We were seated promptly and almost immediately a friendly waitress appeared to take our drink orders. We quickly looked at the menu and ordered a flatbread spinach appetizer. It was great. Don't really remember the sandwich my wife ordered, and I wish i did because she really liked it. I got a Bleu Cheese Burger that was not only excellent, but a fairly hearty size, and I am a big fairly big guy. The fries we both got were OK, however I am not a really big fan a fires so not the best judge anyway. The waitress checked on us just the right amount and my glass was never empty. We both got desserts, and were not disappointed. The portion were big and we started to regret ordering two desserts rather than splitting.

Appetizers came quick but the food took a while but it's food. Good food isn't gonna be rushed which i like so the guy made sure our needs were met with refills. First time at that location which in my opinion was better than the one on route 59 in Aurora. I work with food a bit myself so when someone at my table would say something that didn't make sense i would tell the server differently which i saw he gladly appreciated.

I wasn't going to review, however after having excellent service At the last 2 restaurants we've gone too, people deserve to know how bad it was! We got seated at 712, didn't see our server until 728! We ordered waters, cokes and our food orders (salads and chicken entrees) and waited until 742 to receive them. Now I understand it's Saturday night at 7pm but there was at least 4 open tables that I could see in our section alone. Our entrees came out rather quickly, even before the salads (because we never got those). The food was brought out by another team member, our server never came back to the table until 835! When he arrived with the bill, we handed it right back to him with a coupon. He came back and dropped it off and told us to have a good night. He didn't even apply the coupon! We had to track down a manager bc he was no where to be found. The manager sent him over with 2 free dessert coupons and an adjusted bill. He said, ""you probably think I'm incompetent but I'm not, my manager wants to talk to you"" well needless to say, the manager never came and we didn't see him again. I have those free dessert coupons to other people in our section. I won't be going back, I used to LOVE this Friday's location but it's really gone down hill lately.

When we explained what the previous waiter had said and pointed out the board, she said well I guess you can get my manager if you dont want to pay... which wasnt the point.

Restaurant lacks technology as we were handed a laminated number and name written down in a book. Once our number was quietly called, hostess forgot how many were in our group. Arriving at the table, a chair was found dirty. When mentioned to hostess, she comes back with a plate of napkins and 4 hand wipe packages which she just sets down on the table in front of the dirty chair. Really? She wanted us to clean our own table and chairs? At least our server brought back a rag and wiped everything down for us. No apology and dirty looks from the hostess highlighted that experience.

When I asked why I didn't get a pint I was told that they have 14 OZ pints at Friday's. Very dishonest.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
6,Eva T.,"Elburn, IL",29,4,,1.0,2017-05-26,"Have been coming here for years. Usually a decent place to go with the family. Today was by far the worst time I have ever had. Waited 1/2 hour to have someone come get our drink order after my husband had to go up front and ask. Took them another 15 to get out drinks (just water and ice tea) the waitress never came back to check on us, refill drinks or chips. The food finally came and I had to ask for refills   Etc. .....  it never got better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
4,Josue O.,"Montgomery, IL",23,103,242.0,1.0,2017-05-31,"I've been to various TGI Fridays and generally have had positive experiences. My wife and I decided to hit up this location before we saw a movie next door. It was a Friday evening, so I understand having to wait for a table. However, we, along with about a dozen other parties, waited in excess of a half hour while several tables sat empty and unbussed. When we were finally seated, it took ten minutes before a server came to our table, and that was only because I asked if we had a server.  We finally ordered food (my wife ordered Jack Daniels chicken and a Caesar salad, I ordered Jack Daniels flat iron steak cooked medium). When the server brought out my wife's Caesar salad about fifteen minutes later, it was just a pile of limp lettuce and two croutons. No dressing. None at all. I mentioned this to the server and he said, ""Oh, well we're out of Caesar dressing,"" and then walked away. When I managed to flag him down again, I asked if I could get another dressing instead. He told me, ""Sure,"" and then tells me that he's sorry, because the restaurant is also out of Jack Daniels chicken (???), would we like something else? My wife asks for a burger. The dressing finally arrived WITH dinner, several minutes later. My wife's burger was fine, my steak was extremely undercooked, rare at best. Before we left, I asked to speak with a manager, who never materialized. We ended up being a few minutes late for our movie, as I had to do everything but pull teeth to get our check. This is one TGI Friday's we won't visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
7,Steph S.,"St. Charles, IL",3,50,36.0,5.0,2017-07-03,Love coming here. We are always here. This time I got the new burger - can't remember what it's called but it was delicious.

2,Shevon R.,"Elburn, IL",81,91,108.0,2.0,2017-08-03,"My husband was working and my kids wanted to have a disgusting, artery clogging, all-you-can-eat appetizer bonanza.  So, in that aspect, TGI Fridays did not disappoint.  We decided to go with the appetizer all you can eat deal.  $10 per gluttonous participant.  The 3 of us did it.   Here are the rules: $10 per person eating ""Endless Appetizers"" deal, you can order any of the appetizers on a specified menu, you can change to different ones.  The appetizers are smaller portions of the normal appetizers.  Your choices currently are: Potato Skins, Mozzarella Sticks, Meatballs, Potstickers, Bacon Nachos, Chicken Quesadillas, Barbecue Chicken Flatbread, Boneless Wings (you choose the sauce Buffalo, Jack Daniels, or BBQ). My run down on how they were.  Remember, I am applying the chain food filter to these.  They are not delightful creations.  They are edible greasy bar food that tastes good, but makes you feel guilty for even putting it in your mouth. Potato Skins & Mozzarella Sticks: same as usual, can't go wrong Bacon Nachos: Yuck, soggy chips, fake bacon or fakin, something resembling sour cream on it, not sure what it was Potstickers: Not too bad, sauce just okay Chicken Quesadillas: pretty good BBQ Chicken Flatbread: Yuck, cardboard crust....I thought it was supposed to be flatbread? Boneless Wings: over breaded chicken nuggets disguised as boneless wings Meatballs: looked totally yummy in a little cast iron pan with sauce, melty cheese, and crostini...NOOOO, horrible gaggy meatballs and soggy crostini Anyway, you go home with your tummy and arteries full, but your brain full of guilt.  Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
9,Tammy I.,"Batavia, IL",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-18,"Been going here for years. Since February service and food have declined. I kept trying because everyone has ""off"" nights but seriously disappointed .  My granddaughters food came out ice cold an hour after we ordered it. Our food came in shifts after that.. all cold and service was lacking. Needless to say I won't be going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
0,Jeff E.,"Batavia, IL",1,6,,3.0,2017-09-18,"A tale of two restaurants. During the day during the week Jacquelyn is a great and attentive bartender/waitress. Constantly checking on you even when busy. Night time is a different story most of the staff seems like they don't want to be there. Tables sit unbiased , took forever to get food. Good is usually good or else I probably wouldn't come back at night but for convenience to the theater. We did have one great experience in the evening with Lily. She was attentive even when she seemed overwhelmed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
1,Erin N.,"Columbia, MO",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-02,"It's very sad because I grew up in Geneva going to this TGI Fridays for every single one of my sister's birthday dinners. It was always her first pick and the whole family enjoyed it. About 10 years later I come back to visit and I brought a group of friends here just for old times sake and a cheaper, casual meal.  Our table of 8 was not approached for a good 25 minutes, until the manager came around telling us our server would be right over. Another 10 minutes go by, he introduces himself and immediately walks away. Another 10 minutes, he takes our drink order. 15 minutes go by and we finally receive them, though he forgot about 3 of our orders. Having been a waitress for many years, it seemed our waiter did not care at all. When the food finally arrived they got 4/8 of our orders wrong and completely forgot about one of us! I'm genuinely sad that this place has become so careless, it was my favorite as a kid. Sorry, but I hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
3,Carol B.,"Florence, WI",8,1,,1.0,2018-01-11,I always try to give a restaurant time to get a server to my table. After waiting for 15 minutes and no one even came by with water I had to just get up and leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
