4,Robert M.,"Mason, MI",16,11,27.0,3.0,2016-11-20,"This Chili's location is a above other locations I've been to in prior years; aesthetically at least. Our server was friendly and courteous, even though they were understaffed.  The food was typical of any Chili's, really, nothing that made me go ""wow."" It was a change in our normal routine and trying Chili's out after some time.  I do wish that the burgers were cook to order but that can be dismissed. My side salad came out (along with the appetizer) with our entire meal. So having a table full of plates and food (especially, with small children) can be disastrous.  Overall, the meal was OK, service was great, and the establishment was well cared for. There could be some changes as far as management properly staffing, and where side orders (and apps) come out before the entrees.  Just another average Chili's visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,
8,Jerry C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,1.0,1.0,2016-12-14,Terrible service. Three people at the bar and I walk up to be the fourth. Lady says I will be with you in a moment. Then her and the guy behind the bar leave. Five minutes later I still haven't seen anyone so I walk out. First time there and will be last time. Too many places around here to give my money too. They should close down now. I have spoke with many and everyone has complained on the service. They haven't even been opened that long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,

5,Shelia C.,"Nashville, TN",0,16,,1.0,2017-01-24,"Absolutely the worse service possible at the To Go area. Food was ready but manager too busy with someone doing a scam about a gift card & no one else bothered to take next in line! Simple minds! No plastic ware, no napkins, no ketchup...horrible. 1 star is way TOO much for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,
1,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",78,90,140.0,5.0,2017-07-11,"This chili's is in a brand new location. Relocated from the Kingston Pike location. The new look looks good on them. Not sure if it's the huge windows over looking Turkey Creek or the new decorations but the facelift is nice. The menu has new options, which is pretty cool. I have started to try and make better choices in terms of the kinds of food that I'm eating these days but they have a ton of new items for the summer like the BBQ options and plenty of fried entrees. I went for the Salmon and Broccoli which was quite good. They had a very flavorful drizzle over the top of the Salmon that really topped it off with a slight hint of some cheese as well. The broccoli seems to be flavorful as well with salt and pepper and what I can only a assume to be a bit of butter. Over all though they have something for the whole family. The kids love their menus because they have pictures so they know exactly what they are getting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,
3,Chris G.,"Merritt Island, FL",70,3,,5.0,2017-07-24,I was up here on vacation in Knoxville and found there was the usual great food and wonderful service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,
0,Michelle I.,"Clinton, TN",0,4,2.0,5.0,2017-08-06,"We love Chili's. They have our favorites on the menu but we love to try their new offerings, too! The new Smokehouse Combo is great and a lot of food! I had the jalapeño cheddar smoked sausage and ribs, which are always tasty. I definitely liked the roasted street corn and garlic dill pickles they served on the side. I can't wait to go back and try the Honey Chipotle Crispers and Waffles. Those looked delicious as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,

2,Julie R.,"Atlanta, GA",33,17,1.0,3.0,2017-10-14,Overall they are consistent but I always feel like I eat too many calories even though I order the healthier items off the menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farragut,,,,,
