Hnou V.,"Roseville, MN",49,93,95,3.0,10/24/2017,"I got the BBQ burger. The patty itself was kind of dry. The fried onions just tasted like oily crumbs in the burger, but tasted better eating them by themselves. The fries were okay, but hey they're unlimited. I would have liked more salt on them. It's better than being too salty though. Service was alright. Nothing outstanding or terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2
S N.,"Boulder, CO",38,26,1,2.0,8/27/2017,"I've been to a few Red Robin's and always thought they were nice and casual.  Not this one. Bad food combined with bad service = never again.  It's hard to screw up this type of food but they served us a piece of chicken that was ""literally"" like rubber. I am not kidding when I say we questioned if it was chicken.   And our waitress was pretty awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2

Jason C.,"Osseo, MN",2,21,11,1.0,10/20/2017,Whoops! This place has suffered a major decline in service and food quality while simultaneously increasing prices and shrinking portion sizes. On our most recent visit we waited what seemed like forever to get a drink order in which was then followed by the longest wait for our entrees I can remember. The best part was my sandwich was the size of an appetizer (a $15 appetizer) and the fries were lukewarm and scraps from bottom of the batch. My recommendation would find one of the bazillion other restaurants within a stones throw that figured out how to staff and run a restaurant at a better value.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2
Alicia G.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",61,17,4,1.0,9/4/2017,I guess u don't order fish and chips at a burger place. The fish was fried with dark brown oil that tasted like varnish. The sweet potatoe fries were soggy and underdone. I tried to peel off the crust of the fish cause I was so hungry but that gave me dry fish now. Just horrible.

Jake S.,"Maple Grove, MN",7,101,1081,2.0,6/11/2015,"Pretty subpar burgers for a burger joint. The bottomless fries aren't that great either. The burgers lack flavor, which is strange considering that I had the A-1 peppercorn burger which has steaksauce, pepperjack cheese, and onion strings.  My brother had the Whiskey BBQ burger and wasn't too impressed with it either. You can have all you can eat steak fries, sweet potato fries, or broccoli, or upcharge of a buck for herb garlic fries.  The service is ok and nothing to brag or cry about. Luckily, I had a free burger for my birthday month that I received courtesy of signing up for their loyalty program. I hadn't been here for years and probably won't be back for a few more.

My significant other ordered a burger with a broccoli side, asked for a side salad, and raw onion instead of cooked for her burger. I had a burger and fries, that's it.  Mine was fine, a little overdone.  She never got her salad, got an overdone burger, and no raw onions.  She asked for the raw onions again, guy said he'd go get some, never happened.

Ron B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,16,,1.0,8/26/2015,"1 hr wait. Cold buns, luke-warm patty. If this sounds like your ideal meal, then go ahead. Family and I arrived around 740pm. Ordered our food and drinks. Chit-chatted a bit. We somehow got the 'it's been a while feeling'. Sure enough it was 8:30pm. Waitress  came by shortly with half our orders and apologized for the wait. The rest of the food came out shortly after. My burger and my sister-in-law's burger were luke-warm and the buns were cold. I usually don't complain, but this wasn't right. $12 burgers shouldn't be luke-warm with cold bread.  P.s.

S F.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,2,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"This place used to be a lot better. Their bottomless fries claim is a complete joke when you order food to-go. After having a less than stellar experience last time, we explicitly asked for an extra box of limitless fries for our teenaged boys, the person at the counter said she would make sure we were given lots.

Dustin D.,"Blaine, MN",94,87,132,4.0,4/25/2015,"Great burgers and endless fries! If you are looking for somewhere to hit the spot when you are hungry for a burger, Red Robin is a great choice. First the burgers are pretty good here, they aren't my all time favorite but still very tasty. The fries are indeed endless so go ahead and chow as much as you want but it's nothing that will blow you away. The fries are always there since it's endless so you find yourself eating a lot of them which can fill you up if you are not careful. One of my favorite things about Red Robin is the Strawberry lemonade. They fill the glass with real strawberries which I haven't seen anywhere else. They also have shakes and malts which isn't always the easiest to find so I'll usually mix it up each time I go between a shake or strawberry lemonade. It's a very family friendly place so expect a lot of kids when you go, it can get pretty loud when it's busy. Overall a good choice when you are in the mood for tasty burger. Don't forgot to try the Strawberry lemonade when you go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2

Dawn C.,"Plymouth, MN",2,17,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time.  Which means a lot since my husband & I always give a place three chances.  Not this time. First of all the place is filthy. We should have gotten up and left.  Tired & hungry creates poor decision making skills.  Looks like the table was cleaned off with a greasy rag & having the waitress suggest the kids grab the community chalk & chalkboards to play with before eating made me cringe. I don't even want to know where they'd been.  Not to mention the window blinds were broken & layered in dust. The waitress spilled my Freckled Lemonade every time she brought a refill to the table & never apologized.  Brought our meals and dropped my plate sending fries to the floor, again without an apology.  As other reviewers have noted their bottomless fries are a joke.  The whole time we ate she refilled our bottomless fries once with a tiny handle full  for the table. They serve them piecemeal. My husbands Black & Bleu burger was pathetic- it is supposed to be so loaded with Bleu cheese you need to eat it with a knife & fork - right on the menu.  Instead when he picked up the top bun it had two small lumps smeared across the meat.  I asked the waitress for more Bleu cheese & she brought back a small dipping container with Bleu cheese salad dressing.  My children normally love fish but wouldn't eat the fried cod - said it tasted funny.  I suspect the oil needed to be changed or they were frying with something that shouldn't be mingling.  My crab cake burger was mushy & visually unappealing- they have an awesome food stylist for their menu photos but need a lesson in plating a meal.  Then we get our bill and there are six drink charges - there were four of us.  When we pointed it out the waitress tried telling us it was because my husband changed drinks during the meal, which he had not.  The manager had come by & asked us if we wanted refills, I told my husband he never asked what we were drinking before he walked away & I bet they bring back the wrong drinks.  She did, but we didn't think anything of it since they're all on the bottomless menu at the same price.  My husband never likes to complain about food or service at restaurants because he's always worried about retaliation, so he left a good tip & review.  I wish he hadn't because then how do places like this know they need to work on improving their service & product?  Needless to say I'd recommend steering clear of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=20
Heidi G.,"Minneapolis, MN",144,86,258,2.0,11/6/2015,"Went with my coworkers on a Thursday. There were 8 in our party, we didn't call ahead - our mistake. We waited a half hour for a table. Got seated and waited another 10 minutes to see a server. We had a little table kiosk and we thought we could just bypass that wait and use the ""ziosk"" to order drinks.... but it was broken. Server got our drink order finally (5 sodas, 1 lemonade, 2 milkshakes). 10 min later he came back with 4 sodas, 1 lemonade, 1 milkshake. Said he was going back for the rest. Then forgot about us. We had to flag him down to get the rest. And then we saw someone blending the missing milkshake a few minutes later, so it hadn't even been started yet. We finally got him to come back with that stuff and then to take the order and the food took longer than we'd anticipated. 1 of us didn't get the sauce that was ordered with the fries, only 4 out of 5 of the soda drinkers was ever offered a refill despite sitting there with an empty glass. 1 of the burgers was cold. We asked for napkins, those never came, one of us got up to just go them some himself. And when we were done, we needed one to-go box for an unfinished meal and he never came back with that either, so we had to get that ourselves. Overall - just not a good experience. Update #1: I posted this review the day of our visit. I heard from someone at Red Robin 10 days later who said that someone from the restaurant would be in touch. It's now been 3 months and we haven't heard from anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=20

Jonathan E.,"Minneapolis, MN",29,192,1974,4.0,7/4/2012,"Being in the Midwest, I consider myself to be pretty picky about burgers... Particulary from chain restaurants. However, I am rarely, if ever, disappointed with this Red Robin. The changing menu items, wide variety, great service, rewards program, and unlimited fries are just a few of the reasons to frequent Red Robin. I uploaded serval photos of the various burgers Ive tried--cant say Ive ever had a bad one. My only complaint is that they discontinue a lot of the outstanding varieties (such as the Mount Olympus or Blackened Bayou).  I once had a minor complaint and I was sent a letter of apology along with a gift card--their customer service both in-store and from the corporate level is outstanding.

Tyron was the first person I encountered. He was ENGROSSED with the tv adjacent to the hostess stand. Even when a coworker was talking right at him telling him where to seat us he was oblivious. I would fire Tyron on the spot.  When I ordered I emphatically told the waiter   that I was ""starving and could I get some chips and salsa with my coke right away"" I never saw him again until a manager showed up with our entire order. This was 30 minutes after I ordered. My order was wrong. Instead of NO ONIONS my buyer was loaded with extra onions. The manager tried to say he could have a replacement item in ""2 minutes"". Come on! Don't bullshit me! You took 30 minutes to get me chips and salsa. I don't believe you. In fact I overheard the manager questioning our waiter about our order. It was AT THAT POINT that you had an opportunity to save the meal by coming over to our table to tell us what was going on. You KNEW we were waiting and the appetizer was late.

Well, I was wrong. Red Robin is actually most excellent. Finally swung in here for lunch today and It was a marvelous experience. The service we received was outstanding and the burger, oh the burger was pretty darn tasty and very satisfying. They're main deal is burgers but they also have some sandwiches and other items. My lunch partner actually tried their fish and chips so of course I had to steal me a bite, and much to my surprise the fish was excellent, who knew? It is nice to still have a few burger joints around that cook a burger to your liking, mine was cooked perfect and had a pretty pink hue all throughout the inside of the burger. Who wants a burger well done? They also have this Red Robin seasoning on all of the tables and it's really good on the fries, it's kinda like a funky season-all salt, I wish they sold it!

I looked at my dining companion and we both declared:  ""They really care about their customers!"" So, Go get yerself a lovely burger here.  Or some excellent broccoli.  Right now.

Mike S.,"Minneapolis, MN",26,80,,4.0,2/22/2012,"Typically I do not like writing reviews for chain restaurants.  I don't know, something about it just screams 'generic' or 'been there and done that'.  But I have patronized this Red Robin so many times, with the most recent trip being yesterday, I thought I'd drop a line about them. My coworkers and I always find Red Robin a great decision when we're jonesing for a lunch so big we want to take naps under our desks afterward.  Whether we dine in or carry out, we always seem to gorge ourselves silly.  I've probably had every burger/sandwich on the menu and have never been disappointed.  My favorite at the moment has got to be the blackened chicken sando.  It's got a spicy kick to it that is strangely addicting.  They also have a bbq mayonnaise that is so good that if they put it in a glass I would drink it.  It's heavenly to dip the huge french fries in.  Oh, and did I mention the fries are 'all you can eat'?  Yeah, that's right.  ALL YOU CAN EAT.  Ugh...I just can't stop...   The service is usually pretty good.  Although you will notice a definite lull during the lunch hour for obvious reasons.  There has been a few instances where our stay has breached well over an hour.  So don't be surprised if you find yourself waiting for a table during the peak meal times.

Laura W.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,25,,4.0,8/28/2012,"This is a great, quick place to get a good hamburger. I've liked almost every burger I've gotten, my favorite probably the banzai burger with pineapple on it. Unlimited fries are a bonus, but with the huge burger, you often don't eat them all anyway. Love their bottomless strawberry lemonade. I normally don't get drinks at restaurants besides water, but I will splurge on this one and refill it many times.  If you become a reward card member, you can get free things, most importantly a free burger during the month of your birthday. Been there a LOT for my birthday and I love it. Sometimes they throw in a free ice cream sundae too, depending on how big of a party you're having there.  If I remember correctly, you can get in and out within an hour.

Kohleen S.,"Minneapolis, MN",303,294,300,4.0,10/15/2010,"Holy cow!  I went to Red Robin 6 hours ago, and I'm still full!  Holy unlimited steak fries Batman! Oh, and the bottomless root beer floats! Have you ever heard of such a thing?  I sure hadn't, but when we found out our favorite burger joint closed (Fuddruckers in St. Louis Park), we decided to take a friends advice and pop our Red Robin cherry.   We were already aware of the unlimited fries, and thanks to another yelper, I was clued into the bottomless root beer floats before we arrived.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and had our root beer floats delivered before we could even decide what to eat.  We arrived just before the dinner rush, but by the time we were eating our meals the place was absolutely packed!  It was so hard to decide what to get because the menu was filled with tons of fabulous and creative options.  I ordered the Crispy Arctic Cod Sandwich, which tasted as awesome as it sounded, and my boyfriend had the Burnin' Love Burger, which he says certainly delivered on the spiciness.  Both came with the unlimited fries, but after a second root beer float, I didn't have room for another round of fries.  Although, my boyfriend said ""sure, why not?"" trying to disguise the real reason we visited in the first place (which was the unlimited fries).   I can't say anything too negative about our experience.  Honestly, the quality of the food didn't leave much room for improvement (it's not a 5-star steakhouse after all), and the value was incredible! All of the sandwiches/burgers are giant, as are the fries and the root beer floats. The only snag in the service was the fact that we sat with empty root beer floats for a few minutes after our food arrived (which was EXTREMELY fast), but one of the managers came by our table to check up on us and she brought us refills right away.  Our server did provide us with complimentary waters to start with as well, so it's not as though we didn't have anything to wash the food down with in the meantime, so all in all it wasn't a big deal.   I don't have kids, so I can't say what this place is like for families, but for a young couple at dinner time, it convinced us to return.  This is NOT a place you want to go to if you're on a diet, but if you've had a bad day and want to stuff your face with comfort food or just want to stuff your gut until it nearly explodes...give Red Robin a try. UPDATE: Service in the bar is amazing!

kyle t.,"Maple Grove, MN",215,357,130,4.0,6/6/2009,"This isn't the type of place I would normally go out of my way for or spend time writing about but since I have a daughter, this is the type of place I find myself going to. I have a disdain for places like McDonald's for kids and figure if you're going for a burger, have a burger not some mass of grease and lard.  We have been going here for a few years now and went last night for my daughters birthday since it is her favorite place. Over the years this spot has gone from great to so-so and is swinging back to great again. It is a good family spot. Service is good, not great but good. The food as of late has been very good. The fries are great and bottomless (yes, they will bring you more if you ask) and the kids mac-and-cheese is bottomless as well (although I think the last thing a young child needs is a large man size serving of salty pasta, how about bottomless fruit).  The burgers are very solid though. I did see someone complain on the size. How big does a burger need to be. The Whiskey River Burger I had was average size but had great flavor. The onion slivers on the burger is a great flavor and the sauce added a nice zest. I was full when done and satisfied. Again, the fries are very good. The onion ring are great! Order the tower of onion rings and a beer. Can it get better than this?  I don't know if I would drive out of my way for a Red Robin. But if I am going to take my daughter out for a meal to satisfy her, there is nothing wrong with having a tasty burger, some great onion rings and a beer at the same time.

It was really busy (it looked like every table was full when we arrived) but we were seated within a few minutes... unfortunately, we were seated at a really terrible table that was a double-whammy of next to the kitchen and next to a really cold vent.  I typically muster through these trials, but boyfriend was so cold he actually requested a move (trust me, a rare request from he-who-never-complains)... even though two tables nearby opened up within a minute or so of the request, we never got moved.  Kind of a downer. Overall the food was good.  We split the onion rings and I ordered the new(er?) chili cheeseburger, which was great.  The garlic fries - not so much.  Stick with the regular.  As always, order the freckled lemonade.  I tried it with Minute Maid light (wishful thinking with my burger and fries and onion rings) and it was just as good, so don't worry about missing out.
