David O.,"Nashville, TN",61,937,861,4.0,1/6/2012,"Does reviewing Red Robin locations get embarrassing for me after a while? Well, it hasn't happened yet, so hopefully not anytime soon. Is it a chain? Yes. Is it the best-est burger you've evar had!!!1? Probably not.  But they are really darn consistent when it comes to providing you with just what you like, complete with bottomless fries and a friendly waitperson.  Also, the Red Robin Rewards program is pretty darn good if you come here a few times a year. Plus: Free Birthday Burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-smyrna
Sam G.,"Nashville, TN",70,249,14,3.0,12/31/2011,"Although red robin usually tickles my tastebuds enough to purchase their souper sandwich combine, the experience I had at the Smyrna location left me wondering if I stepped into.the twilight zone. The service was terrible and everyone seemed to be wearing/doing whatever they wanted to do. There was no order to this place. The food was decent as expected though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-smyrna

Andrew M.,"Bargersville, IN",7,26,,4.0,1/13/2011,By far my favorite burger chain.  Excellent service here in Smyrna.  I always get the Turkey Burger with the spicy chipotle sauce.  Great stuff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-smyrna
