10,Marcus L.,"Singapore, Singapore",539,361,758.0,3.0,2012-07-11,"Classic American diner food.  I come here to satisfy my pulled pork burger and sweet tea craving. Made the mistake of ordering a cup of soup once... it was tiny. Don't ever do that to yourself. The nachos on the other hand, are a massive serve, then again, it costs ten dollars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
13,Gloria W.,"Singapore, Singapore",10,158,19.0,4.0,2012-07-22,"Chili's is the go-to place for the kind of indulgent, mouthwatering, greasy American food you see on TV. I have only been to this outlet once but it is pretty much the same and just as good as the one at Sentosa that I usually go to.  I always order the fajitas. A sizzling hotplate with the meat of your choice cooked in onions and this incredible sauce is brought out with fresh tomatoes, guacamole, greated cheese, shredded lettuce and sour cream, as well as a couple of wraps. Just the look of it makes my mouth water and it is really fun to wrap your own fajita too. The burgers are also pretty decent and the sides are usually rather big, like the tostada chips and cheese fries. I have no idea what truly authentic mexican food is but if it's anything like what I get at Chili's then I think I'll fall in love with Mexico.  The only thing that didn't go so well that night was that the beer from the tap that they gave to my sister was flat, and when she requested for a change, it was still the same. However, they accepted the return of her beer quite graciously and didn't charge us for it. I would definitely be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
8,Yiling H.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,180,180.0,4.0,2012-08-13,"Chili's Grill and bar is an established brand name in the US.  Whenever, they is a big group of meet up with my friends, i will suggest this place. However, they don't take reservation. Hence, we always arrive there earlier to skip the queue. It a must to have their Cheese Nacho with beef as the appretiser. Two thumbs up for it! I had Country Fried Chicken as my main course, fried chicken breast topped with black pepper gravy and served with sides of a corn on the cob and black pepper mashed potatoes. The thick slab of chicken breast was surprisingly moist and incredibly fork-tender.  As for their mashed potatoes, it is the best version of mashed potatoes I have ever eaten, hands down.  Definitely has to include Strawberry Lemonade as your drink. It is just so good and sweet. I am totally a fan of their strawberry lemonade.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
14,Zhi Hao Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,179,180.0,3.0,2012-08-16,"Located in Tanglin mall, to my surprise, you would find the shopping mall almost empty but the restaurant is buzzling with customers. This restaurant has a woody interior design and the service level is good. The waiter and waitress are proactive to suggest and take your orders. You can try the chicken and ribs combo, serving can be too big for one person, chicken is juicy and flavoured with cheese while the ribs were cooked just right. One of the disappointed was the beef that my friend ordered. It was dry perhaps overcooked Also, the chocolate lava cake is a queen. You would not want to miss this dessert. It is sweet , with chocolate flowing down the cake. Price is average, similar to any restaurant you can find out there. Certainly a place worth revisiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
11,Pui Yeng C.,"Singapore, Singapore",23,185,185.0,3.0,2012-08-29,"Chilli's is another one of those places that can satisfy any craving for smokey flavours. Despite the hype, I was a little disappointed. The taste and quantity wasn't exactly worth the amount of money paid. The beef fajita came in a fair portion but was a little too much for the four pieces of pitas that came with it. The meat was a on the dry side and was a little bland. The meat just didn't absorb the flavours from the sauce.  The beef burger didn't meet my expectations. Having paid more than $20 for the dish., I expected something that was out of the ordinary. Despite the promising pictures and descriptions of a juicy and thick patty, the actual dish was nothing close to it. The burger itself was considered small for such beef patty burgers, and the patty was pretty dry as well. We also tried the cookies and cream milkshake, which I'm definitely not a big fan of. Instead of being thick and creamy, it was like a watered down version of how it was supposed to taste like.  However, service at the outlet was prompt and the staff were friendly and eager to help. They are able to provide recommendations and explanations for our questions. If you're looking for a place to have a family meal or gathering with friends, Chilli's has the perfect atmosphere for such events. But for the taste and price, it's not a place that I'll be craving for any time soon. But I'll probably give it another chance just to see if I'll change my mind about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
9,Jeremy H.,"Singapore, Singapore",5,90,102.0,4.0,2012-09-09,"I'll be the first to raise my hand and admit that I've never eaten at Chili's throughout my time studying in America and during subsequent trips there. But when the first outlet at Tanglin Mall arrived on our shores, I made it a point to check it out. Call it typical Singaporean behaviour to flock to new restaurants but I'm glad I did. Although it is ordinary American fare much like Applebee's, it lends a nostalgia of dining at an American sports bar. Dipping buffalo wings into the blue cheese dip while watching American football on the TV screens and knocking back a Budweiser, I love the experience. I might even order a Tex-Mex appetizer or two for good measure. Having said that, since I love Chili's more for the experience than the food, if you were like me, you would do well to regulate your visits here just so you keep it somewhat special and novel while it lasts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
12,Carol W.,"Singapore, Singapore",64,142,78.0,4.0,2012-09-09,"Hard to say no to chilli on anything. So I'd come here after a light lunch just to have chilli cheese fries for dinner. You know it's never enough. So you go on a rampage even though you tell yourself you are just flipping through the menu without being serious about ordering anything more. I ended up with buffalo wings, fajitas and even a mental note of a dessert after. Chilli's my kryptonite whenever I'm near by enough. You can be sure to satisfy any meat cravings with the ribs or burgers or just the god old cheesy selections!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
15,Atsha N.,"Mukilteo, WA",36,37,60.0,5.0,2012-12-24,"Love our experience eating here this time. We got table right away and our waiter are very tentative. She always refilled our ice tea when its low. we ordered beef fajitas (big portion and delish), steak and cheese quasadia ( delish also), beef chilli soup (the best chilli ever), warm brownies sunday with vanilla ice cream (big and full of yummyness. The brownies r amazingly soft in the inside). Will be eating here again for sure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
7,Michelle M.,Hong Kong,1461,1252,5829.0,4.0,2014-02-07,"I guess Chili's in Singapore is something I should be proud of, as they came all the way from Dallas, Texas. This branch is perfectly located in Tanglin Mall, aka the foreigner mall (and dare I say it... The white people's mall. I mean it in a nice way!) I don't come here often, but I will admit that when I do, I truly feel like I'm back home in the suburbs of Houston. The decor, signage, and menus are the exactly the same as the US version. They show American sports on the TVs. They make a huge ruckus when they sing the birthday song. The only differences I've noticed are the beers on tap (Tiger instead of Bud) and slight changes in ingredients. What I mean by this is that the rice isn't exactly Mexican style, as it was green instead of orange-y. I think they used a cilantro purée to season it. In other words, the ingredients are similar but the flavor focus is different. The portions are still hearty, and yes, they do have the baby back baby back baby back riiiiiiibs (BBQ SAUCE!) so that makes me happy. Only thing is you really pay for it. I would expect to spend about $25 a person, excluding alcohol and dessert. As this is a chain, I'd normally rate this 3 stars, but since it's not as ubiquitous as McDonald's, KFC, etc. and they remind me so much of home, I'll bestow 4 stars this time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
0,Jen P.,"Buffalo, NY",170,125,402.0,4.0,2014-06-28,"Eating at Chilis in Singapore feels a lot like eating at home, only about twice the cost. Yeah, expect to pay a fortune. On my first visit, I had the chili-mango chicken. It was so hot I had to give it to my husband to finish eating. You'd think they'd note that on the menu somehow. I mean, it's got chilis, so I expect some heat. But my-mouth-is-on-fire-please-call-the-ambulance hot? I was not expecting. Of course, my husband loved it. I just would have appreciated a heads-up is all! On my second visit, I ordered one of the steaks. Perfectly cooked. Not too much fat. And great flavor! There's also free wifi if you want to ignore the people who were kind enough to meet you for dinner. Expect a crowd after 7pm, especially on a weekend. But even when the place was packed, the service was pretty good by Singapore standards!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
5,Maria Victoria D.,"Singapore, Singapore",3,1,4.0,5.0,2015-01-03,Loved eating at Chili's Tanglin Mall..this is one of our go to place when craving for steaks. The food is great and the service is good too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
2,Lala T.,"Singapore, Singapore",5,33,55.0,4.0,2015-02-08,"This is one of our family restaurant in Singapore. Always come here at least once a month, as kids miss their food. Relaxing to have dinner with kids and family, price is reasonable for the quality meal they serve. Staff are friendly, warm, efficient, and fast, i meant constantly.  Kids love their quasadilla, corn on the cobs, nachos, and fajitas. Hubby love their burger, and i love their baby back ribs! Recommended for whole family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
6,Kacie M.,"Dallas, TX",261,452,15.0,4.0,2015-05-15,"I can't give it five stars because it's a chain, and just a mid-range one in the US. That said, as an American living in Asia, Chili's is a really legit taste of home. SO good. The burgers, the Santa Fe salad, the drinks, the queso... oh man. It's the stuff a homesick American dreams of. It's located in Tanglin mall, a hangout for Westerners, and and is beautifully decorated, staffed, and kept up. Great spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
3,ゆ,"Singapore, Singapore",0,40,,4.0,2015-11-07,Popular American Diner in the area.  Lots of families are there during weekend.  The food is nice with American and Mexican food.  They have kids menu as well.  Waiters and waitresses are nice and kind.  Don't expect them to be so speedy as they all are quite busy:) アメリカンダイナーです。料理はハンバーガーから始まってメキシカンまで色々と独自メニューも加わり、楽しく美味しくアンヘルシーに食べられます。お値段も比較的リーズナブルです。オーダーする際には周りの人の料理の量を見て頼みましょう。たまにアメリカンが恋しくなるのでここはまた来ます。2015/11,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
4,Anastasia P.,"London, United Kingdom",7,53,1.0,2.0,2016-01-28,"Classic American chain but the quality could use improvement! I must say, Chilis to me, much like TGI Fridays or Applebees, demands a certain level of quality across the board - things shouldn't vary TOO much across locations, since that's what people come to expect when they go to chains such as this. The whole restaurant follows in true American style and decor - booths galore, televisions showing sports, and hue portions! One puzzling thing though: the glassware is plastic and I've never had this experience in any US location!  It was a weeknight so not sure whether they thought we'd get rowdy...? We ordered the guacamole to start - it came with a small dish of salsa as well.  Both were just okay, but SO COLD that they clearly just came out of the fridge - Chili's, it's fine if you pre-make your guac, but at least make a bit more of an effort to hide that fact! Then we got the chili cheese fries - this was the BEST thing we ate the whole evening! Fries laden with chili, sauce, cheese and jalapenos, served with a very American (aka deliciously artificial) ranch sauce for dipping. The main course was a huge disappointment - the short rib steak was very bland, despite loads of pickled onions on top.  The Santa Fe quesadillas were a huge portion, and distinctly average. We did order a side of 'skillet mac and cheese' - this is by far the most disappointing pasta dish I've had in the country!  The macaroni were overcooked, and swimming in a thin layer of watery yellow sauce!  The boxed stuff gives thicker sauces than what was on that 'skillet.'  Also, not using real cheese kind of defeats the purpose of serving food on a skillet, since it just stays a melted goopy mess! Credit to them, they took the mac and cheese off our bill - but really Chili's...how hard is it to throw in some butter and real cheese?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
1,Lilian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,27.0,1.0,2016-08-27,"We booked a promotional of getting 50% off main course if coming between 11-11.30.   I lived in California for 10 years and love Mexican food, I always have decent impression of Chillie's (it being an American chain store so should serve rather large portion and of a decent standard especially for Mexican food).  We order 2 main - beef & shrimp fajita and salmon with rice.  When the food came I was very disappointed, the shrimps were frozen type and all the condiment were so little for 4 serving of fajitas.  This dish is listed at $30 and I was astonished at food quality of such high price, although I am getting a promotional deal but still no excuse. Salmon with rice was of a decent size but salmon was completely burned so we had to scrape off the top layer ... Service wise was also disappointing, since it was early hour of their operation, there were 2-3 servers but I had to look for them 3 times to get what I want (get a seat, take order, get a spoon). Maybe it was the beginning of operation hour but if they were encouraging customer to show up before 12 noon then they ought to educate their staff or provide them with more support...  In short it was a very unpleasant and disappointing experience... No excuse for serving sub-standard food even when you offer discount.  I won't be coming back or going go any other chilli's chain stores in Singapore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore,,,,,
