29,Tabitha M.,"Saline, MI",148,299,60.0,2.0,2012-05-05,"Ugh.  Talk about disappointing! First, let me say that I'm a fan of ""the bird"".  I frequented the Flint location once a month or so when I lived in that area.   This was a horrible experience!  We were seated promptly, but then it all fell apart.  We sat too long before being greeted.  When our server finally did come to the table, she was lackluster and seemed uninterested.  Drinks were slow to arrive, despite the empty dining room and lack of guests sitting at the bar.  I decided to try the sweet potato fries for the first time.  They were cold, thin and limp.  I had finished my whole burger before our server came back to check on us.  When I told her I didn't like the sweet potato fries, she looked like a deer in headlights--she had no idea how to respond.  She didn't apologize.  She then disappeared.  No offer of dessert.  We sat and sat and sat and sat.  My water was empty.  My drink was empty.  I didn't see her anywhere.  When she finally made it back to the table with our check, she apologized and said her manager couldn't figure out how to get the $.99 upcharge for the sweet potato fries off my bill.  What a nightmare!  I paid the bill and got the heck out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
23,Jiggity J.,"New Hudson, MI",0,14,,2.0,2012-10-13,"I typically go to red robin when I want a big tasty chain burger, which is not terribly often as I try to humor small businesses if I can help it.  When I go to RR I know that, while the service may vary, the burger is typically always consistent.  Oh, what's this? They have a smaller burger size? That's cool as it's about time.  We went in with the intention of splitting a guacamole bacon burger and a round of fries as we aren't big people and that's more than enough for us.   Our entree arrives and it actually fits in our mouth. How peculiar as this has never happened before.  Also, the bacon had the soggy grossly undercooked consistency you expect at burger king.  This has never happened to us at a RR before.  It tasted overly-smokey, the guacamole had zero flavor, and the worst part was IT WAS EXTREMELY SLOW there (not the service, but almost no customers), so the undercooked bacon was pretty much unforgivable.   I highly suspect since we were being 'cheap' they may have slipped us the smaller burger, because we don't usually leave there saying we could eat still.  It could be RR has downsized the burgers?  I don't eat there hardly ever so if someone could validate if a change has happened in burger size, please let me know.  I would humor another location, but not if im paying 10$ for basically half the burger I've had in the past.  I'm seriously considering writing corporate to ask.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

For one, the parking lot is very strange as far as layout goes. Second, our service left us wanting more. Known for prompt drink refills, etc. we were often left thirsty. Third, the food presentation and wrapping of the burgers wasn't great.

28,Paula K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",78,115,37.0,2.0,2013-03-09,"We have been to this restaurant quite a few times since my first review. It is generally good but after the visit we had tonight, I don't believe we will be going to this location again. I contacted them with our ""experience"".  Below is a copy/paste of the contact: My husband & I arrived at 5:50pm. He dropped me at the door and I went in and was put on a list. We were 2nd on the list and was told it would be about a 10 minute wait. It started to get crowded pretty quickly. Two tables were called, a party of 2 and a party of 3. Then a  young girl came in with her boyfriend and she apparently knew one of the hostesses because she came over to chat with her. They were seated immediately. My husband had seen them in the parking lot and they came in after us so my husband asked why they were seated first. He was told that they had left and had come back. My husband heard a hostess say BEFORE they were seated that ""OUR"" party was next. Then ANOTHER table of 3 was called that came in after I had been waiting over the 10 minute time. THEY too were called so I went and asked what was happening. I was ALSO told that these people had come in earlier but were outside waiting. There were NO people outside waiting when I came in. Two more names were called. We waited until 6:25 and then we just gave up and left.( We had waited 35 minutes on a quoted 10 minute wait time).  It might be a good idea to have a manager check on the wait from time to time. Skipping around on the list like these girls were doing was ridiculous. Our previous visits to this location have been good but we will have no trouble finding a restaurant that seats according to the list and not after friends of the hostess get seats. EDIT- spoke with a manager who said she would be sending gift certificate because of what happened. That was Monday, called her back Friday and she said she had not had time to go to the office to get a certificate to send yet. Will update IF she actually sends it. Last edit- It took over two weeks. A twenty dollar gift certificate was sent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
31,Dave C.,"Howell, MI",1,7,,5.0,2013-11-27,"Every time I go here the wait staff is great and the food is good. I don't think a bad review on a restaurant as well known as red robin is going to stop somebody from going there....you could go to any restaurant at some certain time and you might have a ""minor"" inconvenience. These people who write negative reviews should really think about how many things are going on in a restaurant all the time. There is bound to be a longer wait then expected sometimes...maybe a hostess says you are ""next"", when she is mistaken.....heaven for bid she make a mistake when it effects you...or your burger you ordered wasn't ""presented well enough for you"". People, give it a rest and give people a break...you are not the only person on this planet that matters....and if you are going to take the time to write a review and criticize trivial meaningless things..I suggest you take a breather and look at the big picture of life.

27,Kayleigh D.,"Bradenton, FL",2,2,,1.0,2014-06-17,"My boyfriend convinced me to go to dinner at this Red Robin, which I've only ate at once prior. WORST SERVICE EVER! I am a waitress at a restaurant and I always give servers the benefit of the doubt but this was the absolute worst experience of my life. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted, another 10 to bring me my water with lemon and I never got the lemon. My burger came out wrong, turns out the server never rang some of my toppings in. The manager didn't even care when we complained! I never got a napkin or the boxes I asked for, I noticed he had 2 other tables but come on how hard is it!? The table next to us also complained and got some of their meal taken care of. We ended up almost being late for our movie because that's how slow this guy was. I tipped $4 on $30 which I always tip 20%, as you should, but this was terrible and I will never be back and I will tell people about my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

Our burgers were rare when we asked for medium well, which is something no 'burger' place should ever get wrong.

They have shakes and things the kids had to have. Then the appetizer. Then the food. Overall, it is not bad priced, but there is a lot to pick from. By the way, the salads are huge and have more calories than the burgers... by far. But as far as value goes, they are worth it. you can eat one salad over two meals. Our waitress Ginny was awesome. We stopped here from Toledo on our way to  frankenmuth, because we had never tried it. Overall, a great place.

15,Tamara H.,"Troy, MI",0,7,,1.0,2016-05-02,"My mom and I went to this Red Robin for lunch yesterday and today we are both bedridden after being sick multiple times throughout the night. From the beginning, the experience itself was not very good. The host seated us in a booth in the bar area and told us ""you guys can sit in this booth because I don't feel like walking to the back (of the restaurant), and yes, the table is clean but all of the tables here are old so they look gross"". We would have been fine being seated at this table, but all of his comments were weird and unnecessary. Then our waitress came over. She was pretty nice, we ordered a water with lemon and a freckled lemonade. She brought the water over a few minutes later (it didn't have a lemon) and told us that she could not find the bartender so it would be a few minutes for the freckled lemonade. About ten minutes later, she brought the lemonade over and we placed our orders. The bar area of the restaurant was not busy at all so it was kind of frustrating that it took almost 20 minutes to place our order. I ordered the garden burger with fries and my mom order the whiskey river BBQ burger with fries. The food came pretty quickly and tasted good. Once she brought our check, our server asked us to fill out the survey and give her a ten because ""it would make the managers like her more"". To me, the purpose of having a survey is to be honest about the experience and it was tacky that she was asking for a perfect review. The only thing that our meals had in common were the tomatoes, lettuce, and fries, so I'm not sure what caused both of us to be so sick, but after a subpar experience and now dealing with this over 24 hours later, I will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton,,,,,

Other than blue and American cheese in this list you can't tell what cheeses are safe.   I can never tell what cheeses are safe because I can't find them.   Servers never know where to find this info and are not helpful.    I question how accurate this list even is because I also had soy listed as an allergen and items know to contain soy like mayo are listed as ok to eat.   If you are going to provide allergen info , make sure it is accurate and complete and train your employees.

After finally ordering, our food was brought out completely wrong. First of all don't give the option as to how the burger is cooked if the cooks can't make a burger to order. Our burgers ordered medium were so raw they were still bright red and looked how raw hamburger looks, like worms!
