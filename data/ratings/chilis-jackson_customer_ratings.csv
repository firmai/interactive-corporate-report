28,Bryan W.,"Austin, TX",2,21,2.0,1.0,2012-07-27,"Other than our server, there was nothing remotely enjoyable about our dining experience. The monitors were too sweet; I managed to drink mine but my girlfriend couldn't even drink the margarita they brought in exchange for the mojito. The food was so-so, not what I usually expect from Chili's.  Our waiter was the shining star. He caught errors on our bill, was attentive, and did what he could to make it a more pleasurable dining experience. If the food and beverage had matched his service, it would have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003
27,Sean F.,"Urbana, IL",225,73,76.0,2.0,2012-10-22,"Oh boy, what in the heck happened to this Chili's? I've been here a couple of times a year for the last six, and my last visit was horrid, as in an almost two hour ordeal of improperly prepared food and employees falling all over themselves to get it wrong. The kitchen never did get me the right food and my kids went bonkers as they do when they're hungry, when their food took an hour to arrive. I'm just floored.  To compensate for their mistakes, the manager gave me coupons for free kids meals. Truth be told, my kids' meals were just fine. Mine was the problem. The only reason I gave this Chili's two stars is because my previous experiences with them have been just fine. Sad.  I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576
31,Codi R.,"Brownsville, TN",1,6,2.0,3.0,2014-05-29,"My last experience here was great. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive though he did use petnames towards women and that was a bit bothersome. It was pretty clean, I didn't see anything extremely dirty, not even in the bathroom. The food took very long, though. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen but it took a fair amount of time. Despite that, it was very good. The Big Mouth Bites will forever be a favorite of mine. The new technology they have on the table is neat; we paid our bill through it when we wanted too. It was nice not having to wait on the server to drop the check off and then swap our card. Our drinks stayed full through the whole meal which was delicious. The reason for three stars is for how long the food took and that I think the waiter kept getting a little too friendly and was overdoing it. Granted, I'd rather have it overdone than under. Also, an afterthought, the hostess wasn't attentive to her station. I believe they were using her as a runner but she didn't seem very nice. Besides that, I would recommend this place and I am coming back sometime in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001

24,Jason B.,"Birmingham, AL",26,112,186.0,4.0,2015-07-08,Great service at the bar. I'm from Birmingham and I was shocked to hear that the best special was two for the price of one til 10. Bartender was   prompt and I never had an empty glass or glasses. Lol....food was good for a place like this.

17,Jesse B.,"Huntingdon, TN",0,15,1.0,1.0,2015-08-29,I have no idea what happened to this place. I've not been in quite a while and it used to be great. Not the case anymore. SLOW is the word here. Took forever to get anything...even a drink refill which was wrong by the way. Appetizer I had to wait 20 minutes on is a bit much for me. My entree was on the low end of decent. I got the Cajun chicken pasta. Absolutely minimal amount of chicken...not even half of a breast that was seasoned with nothing. The pasta was overdone and there was maybe a tablespoon of sauce for the entire dish. It was too dry to even finish. Only reason I have the one star rating was because dessert was the chocolate lava cake which is delicious.  I don't think I will even give this place another try. Too many better options in the Jackson area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005
26,Chris W.,"Jackson, TN",28,15,,2.0,2015-11-10,"Oh Chili's of yesteryear, where have you gone? This used to be one of my favorite places to go, but now everytime that I've been I swear that I'll never return but somehow I keep giving them another chance, thinking that something is going to change. But it never seems to. Last time I was there I ordered cheese fries as an appetizer and 30 minutes after ordering the server tells me that they are still working on it. How long does it take to melt some freaking cheese on some fries that you've already got cooked? The rest of the food there is blind by comparison to what it used to be. Gone are some of the favorites of mine such as the mushroom Jack fajitas, Monterey chicken and many others only to be replaced my food that is obviously heat and eat type food. Service there is OK, but nothing to brag about. If you go I'd recommend sitting in the lounge, there is a guy who has worked there for a long time that always has some crazy glasses and is pretty loud(just his personality, he's a cool guy) but he's the best server you'll find there bar none.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.608,1.6080000000000003
21,Rachel S.,"Dallas, TX",66,1,,1.0,2016-01-09,"Worst service I've ever had. Long story short I NEVER even received the food I ordered. When I asked to speak to a manager about it all he said was ""well I took the food off of your ticket."" Well I would hope so!!!! Not apologetic at all. I'm not ever going to step foot in that Chili's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,,,,,
25,Kim L.,"Jacksonville, FL",29,3,,1.0,2016-02-07,"My husband and are on the road for work traveling the US. We stop at Chili's in different areas of the country quite frequently. Mainly for their two for one drinks and the food and service is generally good. However this particular Chili's was a disappointment. First, there was a wait. It was a Friday night and we really never mind waiting. That is expected.  So we put our name in with the hostess and watched for a few spots at the bar to open. At the bar, we asked for a beer and a wine. The bartender then asked to see our I.D.'s. My husband and I are in our 40's. I didn't bring my purse with me so I didn't have mine but my husband had his. I offered to go get mine from our truck, but the bartender said, ""don't worry about it."",  and promptly served us. I was grateful because it was cold outside. So while waiting for a table for dinner, we had two drinks each. Basically, an hour wait. We went to our table and the waitress came to take our order for drinks. I asked for a glass of wine. She said,"" Can I see your I.D.?"" I told her I didn't have it but I had just had two drinks at the bar. She said it was the law and they ask everyone. I get that. I'm in a different state and I know laws vary. I know she was just doing her job. But, the point is that the bartender should have had me go get my ID like I offered instead of telling me not to worry about when I ordered my first drink. So I ordered tea. No problem. Well, I can't say that I wasn't a little irritated, but I didn't want to take it out on her. That would not of been nice. I guess I was more irritated with the law itself. I mean I'm no spring chicken. I haven't had a facelift or anything. I definitely look old enough to order a drink. Maybe the state should allow people to use common sense. How logical is it to ID everyone? Do they ID 80 year olds as well? The government should give people some credit to discern these things. OK, rant over about that. My fault for not having my ID on me. Lesson learned. So, I looked forward to my meal. I decided on one of their burgers and fries. It was called the smokey something. BBQ sauce, cheese, bacon, pickles, lettuce, tomato, fried onion rings. Sounds delicious and flavorful, right? Should be bursting in flavor!  Not hardly. It had NO flavor. I mean did whoever created this thing taste it before it went on the menu? And oh, the fries were cold. And, the restaurant itself was freezing. Lovely eating dinner with a coat on. In my younger days, I wouldn't have been so nice but I ate what I could stomach and never complained and even left a good tip and smiled. So just thought maybe writing a review here would be best. You've had fair warning. Bring your ID, even if you are on your death bed! They can't discern age there. Well, the state won't allow them to use their brains. But on a positive note, my dog was happy with my left overs. She'll be writing her review momentarily.  Love ya, Kim",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,,,,,
23,Palomino G.,"Lexington, TN",2,2,1.0,1.0,2016-02-13,"Went there tonight to celebrate my birthday, but it was a horrible experience! Granted, it was crowded but even the manager couldn't explain why at least two other tables seated after us had their apps, and their dinners and left even before we had eaten. Half our orders were cold and at least those were comped. What a disappointment! It always had such excellent service and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,,,,,
18,Steven R.,"Dover, TN",28,3,,1.0,2016-02-27,"WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!! Went here because my rewards points were going to expire if I didn't. Seriously, one star is too generous for this place. It took  5 minutes for a hostess to greet us when we arrived and then the wait was half an hour longer than we were quoted. We finally got a table with the highchair we needed for our daughter. My wife went to move the highchair and stabbed herself on the broken wood hanging from the bottom and then we couldn't strap the baby in because the clip was missing. 5 minutes later the waitress finally arrived and we asked for a different highchair. We then waited ten minutes for the waitress to come back and take our order. An hour later (half of that with an empty glass because the waitress was MIA) our food arrived. COLD. The ""sizzling hot"" fajitas were room temperature and the tortillas had been sitting so long, they were chewy. Finally asked to speak to a manager, but she didn't show up for another 5 minutes. Explained why I'd called her and that I wasn't comfortable paying for a meal that we couldn't even eat. She disappeared. And never came back. So we just got up and left.  Looking at the other reviews on here, I'm not surprised. Wish I had checked them before I went. Honestly the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant!  Surprised they're still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,,,,,

14,Paul B.,"Charlotte, NC",240,19,14.0,1.0,2016-06-02,"I normally don't leave negative reviews. But...This was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. It took 25 minutes to get our 3 waters & tea, 30 mins to receive our lukewarm quest and cold chips. After 40 minutes from sitting down, and only seeing our server twice, we left cash on the table and walked out. It was a chaotic, understaffed environment. I wish we would have read the reviews before stopping here. Keep driving- or follow us to Chickfila.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,,,,,
16,Christa B.,"Harrisburg, NC",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-06-02,I would give them 0 stars if I could.  We went in and waited 20 mins for our waitress & drinks. (We assumed she was new)  We ordered our food at the same time as our drinks. 20 min. later we got our appetizer. Which was lukewarm at best. But we devoured it because my family of 5 was so hungry.  We only saw our waitress those 2 times. She never stopped by to refill our chips or drinks.  At an hour in and seeing that other tables who ordered before us didn't have their food we decided to leave.  Horrible all around. Very frustrating since we were driving through on our way to Memphis.  Don't stop here. No matter how much you're craving chilies!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,,,,,
22,Nathan C.,"Jackson, TN",0,5,1.0,1.0,2016-06-04,"Chaotic. I understand the waitress was new, but this left the manager and even the host running her errands more times that not keeping them from doing their job. Even the host asked us if she has been back to take our order. The manager was nice, but I feel it was poorly managed due to them assigning the new girls the majority of the tables at close. She was clearly unable to manage all of them letting many orders get misplaced and making us feel sort of left out. I wanted to try their Dr Pepper BBQ sauce in a little ramekin, and asked about 3 times until she eventually told me it would come with my food. I didn't want it with my food; I wanted it to try it when I wanted to try it. Is it so hard to call for a ram of Dr Pepper BBQ sauce? When the food finally came it was delicious and on point. Overall, if they can get your order right, you should be alright. Paying at the kiosk on the table was a blessing cause I have a feeling we would have never gotten our check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson?start=20,,,,,

Worst advice we've had at Chili's yet!! Took forever for our waiter to get us refills. Food was mediocre at best. Haven't been to a Chili's in over a year, and now I remember why!

12,Kurt W.,"Arlington, TN",4,10,1.0,5.0,2016-06-19,"Father's Day party of 19, went to Chili's because we had several picky children who like the food there and every adult can find something to eat.  We were seated quickly (2 tables) and were happy to learn it was 2 for 1 drinks...beer and cocktails....necessary to deal with so many family members. The key to the visit was the server.  You can't miss him, crazy orange-colored glasses, tattoos on both arms, Nintendo controller belt buckle.  This guy was the best waiter, EVER.  Fast to bring us food, drinks kept coming, water never empty, he easily managed the 3 or 4 tickets we had going, had a great personality and was on top of his freaking game.  Full of hustle, seemed to actually enjoy his job.  Sit in his section and your good....if you like Chili's.  PS, I had never been to this location.  Food and service was way better than in Memphis where I go in a desperate pinch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,,,,,

However, I'm pretty sure that what I ordered would've been nice. It turns out that they didn't have it at that time. The waiters and waitresses are great. If you ever go there, and you have a kid, or you just want to have a great dinner, ask for Andrew. He is the most kid-friendly waiter I have ever met.

6,Susan A.,"Gates, TN",1,25,22.0,1.0,2017-04-21,Ordered cheese fries- never got them. Finally 20 minutes later I asked about them (after our salads were eaten) and she said she would check on them. She then brought out appetizer plates and said they were working on the cheese fries and so I canceled the appetizer because I knew our food was going to be out soon.        My chicken strips were so salty I had to spit them out into a napkin. It was terrible. So I ordered a burger. The burger was way bigger than the stale bun it was on and it was  so covered in grease that it was dripping everywhere.  They didn't even comp the burger.        The restroom was filthy and smelled horrible.       I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jackson,,,,,

First off we were told a 15 min wait. Not bad I thought. So a couple come in behind us and they get put on the list. Then a group comes in and gets seated right away. I look around and nobody looks surprised. Then in comes someone else. They see a waiter they know. ""You got a table for me?""  Sure. And off they go to be seated.  So we finally get seated. I ordered chips and queso. Chips all crunched up. Not good. I ordered medium steak. I know. I get it. You don't expect a great steak from Chilis. But I got beef jerky.  Not a good experience.
